1
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:36,670
Get out of the way!

2
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,336
This way!

3
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,554
Saint Luke's Hospital.
I repeat, Saint Luke's Hospital.

4
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,692
Does anything hurt?

5
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,590
Sweetheart, is your mommy here?

6
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,354
Do you know where she is?

7
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,437
Really, I'm just... No.

8
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,634
Don't come over.

9
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,879
No. No, I swear
I wasn't just seeing things.

10
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,947
I mean, it could have just been a prank.

11
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:20,222
I don't know who.

12
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:25,159
No, really, I'm just gonna see you
at school tomorrow.

13
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,790
Thanks, Leann.

14
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:31,964
Bye.

15
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,995
Luna?

16
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,805
Luna?

17
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,578
Come on.
Over here.

18
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,575
Beth's a little too sane for me,
but she does throw a good party.

19
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:38,448
Yeah, so now I'm having sex
and phone sex at the same time.

20
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,418
Oh, man. Are you serious?

21
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:47,318
I know, but he was just so handsome.

22
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,658
And I was so nervous, you know?

23
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:53,324
<i>And I'm trying to describe
the plot of Beloved to him...</i>

24
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:55,061
...and I just started crying.

25
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:58,503
It was a perfect year, wasn't it?
I loved it.

26
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:05,343
Brian, could you get your eyes off Taylor
for two seconds and help me with this?

27
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,780
Unbelievable.

28
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:14,252
And before the sheets are even cold.
No wonder why Leann moved out.

29
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:18,326
I am a man. I have needs.
Is that a problem for you?

30
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,295
No. But it might be a problem for Taylor.

31
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,956
Hot. Yes, well...

32
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,331
...we can't force Taylor
to have good taste, now can we?

33
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,066
Just keep chopping.

34
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,642
I'll keep chopping.

35
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:44,084
You know, I can hear you analyzing me in
your head. You might as well do it out loud.

36
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:48,051
Okay, I think that
you're still messed up over Leann.

37
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,021
You think if you flirt with Taylor...

38
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,128
...maybe Leann'll get jealous
and come back to you.

39
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,124
Go back to analyzing me in your head.
I think I like that better.

40
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,833
Hey, did someone lock the door?

41
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,967
- Hey, Leann. Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:35,195
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

43
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,568
- Me too.
- Is... Is Brian home?

44
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,676
Yeah, he's in the kitchen,
so we should go upstairs.

45
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:47,548
How you doing?

46
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,882
Oh. Oh.

47
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,657
Hey, it's Leann.

48
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,157
Bye.

49
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,429
Okay. Just leave the alarm off. Thanks.

50
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,734
Hey.

51
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,809
How was it?

52
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,115
It was a funeral. It sucked.

53
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,750
From now on, I only go to parties
where no one gets cremated.

54
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,990
How are Shelley's parents?

55
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,755
Considering their 24-year-old daughter
drowned in the backyard pond...

56
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,189
...they're great.

57
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,993
And you?

58
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,598
I knew Shelley.
We interned at Saint Luke's together.

59
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,706
I mean, she was not crazy.

60
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,934
I know, but the way she was
talking at the end was pretty...

61
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,169
Yeah, that doesn't mean
she killed herself.

62
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:56,549
That's not my ringtone.

63
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:07,959
It says it's from Shelley.

64
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,063
Who'd be calling from Shelley's phone?

65
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,130
That's creepy.

66
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,339
It's dated Monday, 10:17 p. m.

67
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:27,746
It's Friday. Maybe you just
set the date wrong.

68
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,297
Leann, what is it?

69
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,090
Leann?

70
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,908
<i>If you'd like to hear this message
again...</i>

71
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,511
<i>...press one.</i>

72
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:03,783
<i>Voice call received Monday,
June 12th, 10: 17 p. m.</i>

73
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:07,912
<i>I don't know,
it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.</i>

74
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,220
<i>It's like every time I
turn around, they're...</i>

75
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:17,562
<i>No! Aaah!</i>

76
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,230
That's your voice.

77
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:25,206
That's you.

78
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:36,108
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

79
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,459
<i>Cut me a break, man.</i>

80
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,388
<i>No, man, you know what the price is.
You gotta hit it right.</i>

81
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,754
<i>All right. Give me that.</i>

82
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,551
<i>All right, slow down, homie.</i>

83
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,226
Okay?

84
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:49,959
Yeah. They're real nice.

85
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,971
Detective Andrews. Yeah.

86
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,439
<i>A group of hikers found her.</i>

87
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:07,275
We held off on the autopsy
until you got here, detective.

88
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:13,480
Even so, your sister was out
there for more than a week.

89
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:16,958
There's really no need for you to do this.

90
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,385
Whew.

91
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,769
Oh, jeez.

92
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,739
In cases of severe and repeated
childhood abuse...

93
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,182
...the posttraumatic-stress model
may be valid.

94
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,878
Long-term effects may include
sexual dysfunction, amnesia...

95
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:58,618
...dissociation, even hallucinations
and multiple personalities.

96
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,952
The post-trauma child...

97
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,190
...faces formidable developmental tasks...

98
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,996
...and among these what we call
"dissociative virtuosity. "

99
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:15,701
The post-trauma child
will form primary attachments...

100
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,005
...to develop a sense of basic trust...

101
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,708
...and to preserve a sense
of hope and meaning in life.

102
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:28,120
The child will, from this experience,
attempt to...

103
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,420
...construct an explanation
of what's happened.

104
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:38,592
And these explanations may excuse
the parental negligence or abuse.

105
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:42,726
The child may blame themselves
for what has happened.

106
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,868
Look, if you come over
earlier then we can study some more.

107
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,481
Leann!

108
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,744
Hey. Do you wanna
go get some coffee?

109
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
No. No. I've...

110
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:04,991
...gotta get to the library.
Paper's due next week.

111
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,089
Are you okay?
You seem kind of weirded-out.

112
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,023
I haven't been sleeping too well.

113
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,035
Call me tonight.
I'll read you my paper...

114
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:18,037
...on developmental perspectives
in abuse cases. It's better than Ambien.

115
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:23,037
Okay. Bye.

116
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,008
Bye.

117
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,682
<i>The library will be closing in five
minutes.</i>

118
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,531
- Hey, Lee.
- Hey.

119
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,139
Hey, what's up?

120
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:28,367
Oh, I'm just finishing up this paper.
What are you doing?

121
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:34,977
I just got sprung from the stacks.
My brain was mushing out.

122
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,947
<i>Oh, God, I know what you mean.</i>

123
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:46,561
<i>Leann?</i>

124
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,196
<i>Leann? Hello?</i>

125
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:55,633
Listen, Beth, I didn't mean to ditch you
after class today. I...

126
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,426
<i>Leann, are you still there?</i>

127
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,482
I don't know how to explain it.
L... I've been...

128
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,752
<i>- I've been having some problems.
- What kind of problems?</i>

129
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:22,361
Ever since I...

130
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:23,793
Well, I don't know.

131
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:28,327
I mean, Shelley drowned,
and that was my voice screaming.

132
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,736
And then that bizarre phone call,
and it was dated today.

133
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:38,140
10:17 p. m.

134
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,178
- I don't...
- Where are you?

135
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:49,290
I'm at the overpass on College.

136
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:52,952
That's two minutes away.
I'll be right there.

137
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:57,656
I keep seeing things. I mean,
weird people looking at me.

138
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,758
<i>- Leann?
- I'm sorry.</i>

139
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,199
I didn't mean to panic. I've just...

140
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:05,272
I've been seeing
some really strange stuff.

141
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:10,475
I don't know,
it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.

142
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:13,342
<i>Every time I turn around, they're...</i>

143
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,217
Leann!

144
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,196
- No! No!
- Leann!

145
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,544
Didn't see anything?
Like I said, she threw herself off.

146
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:23,110
Please, can we go?
This is taking so long.

147
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,220
You're gonna have to stay here
until I get all the information.

148
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,219
I need you to sign this statement.

149
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,659
- Hey.
- Hey.

150
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:41,134
And then she got this strange phone call.

151
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:42,600
It's hard to believe.

152
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:46,434
Yeah, Leann told me the same thing
happened to Shelley before she drowned.

153
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:48,269
- That is so eerie.
Taylor.

154
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:53,208
What? I'm just saying what Leann said.

155
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,873
Yeah, well, maybe this isn't the time,
all right?

156
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,380
I heard Shelley got a phone call
from an old advisor of hers.

157
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,719
I heard that too. Only it turned out
the advisor was already dead.

158
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,621
Would you stop it?

159
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,829
Her parents are right in the other room.

160
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,602
It's like dead people call you,
but it's your own voice.

161
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,467
And then you die too.

162
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,000
Shit, Taylor, know what?

163
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:24,577
Don't try to think, all right?
It just makes you look ridiculous.

164
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,184
I heard it too.

165
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:33,946
That's it. Now I'm really creeped out.

166
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:37,751
It's shit, all right? It's total bullshit.

167
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,902
Brian! Brian!

168
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:55,236
What's his problem?

169
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,838
He had a thing for Leann.

170
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,506
Brian.

171
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,085
Are you okay?

172
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:38,879
What was that back there?

173
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:55,369
<i>To listen to your messages, press
one.</i>

174
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,774
<i>Voice call received
Wednesday, June 14th...</i>

175
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,775
<i>...12:02 p. m.</i>

176
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:06,075
<i>Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I
didn't have my head screwed on...</i>

177
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,854
The call came in two nights ago.
From Leann's phone.

178
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,858
- That was the night that she died.
- Only the call was dated Wednesday.

179
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,691
Today. 12:02 p. m.

180
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,800
I don't believe in magic, Beth.

181
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,903
I don't believe in anything. But ever since
I got that phone call, things have been...

182
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,210
...weird.
- Like what?

183
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,348
No, Brian, you have to tell me.

184
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:44,883
That's the exact same thing
that Leann told me right before she...

185
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:49,150
Brian?

186
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,784
What's wrong? Brian?

187
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,028
Look...

188
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,067
- What's...?
- Forget about it, okay?

189
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,103
- No, Brian, don't!
- These things work...

190
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:09,937
...because they get in your head, Beth.
You're the psych lady, you know that.

191
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,155
If you don't think about it,
it can't hurt you.

192
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,221
Like I said.

193
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:41,273
Brian, your phone!

194
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,377
You forgot your phone.

195
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,476
Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I
didn't have my head screwed on...

196
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:13,306
Let's go over this again.

197
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,878
Welder's acetylene tank exploded.
Your friend happened to be in the way.

198
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:20,742
Okay. And what about
Leann and the voice mails?

199
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:24,215
We checked on that. There were no
voice mails on your friends' phones.

200
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:27,287
- Either of them.
- But I heard them. Okay?

201
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:31,358
Leann got a phone call, and so did Brian,
right before they died.

202
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,219
Both of them did.

203
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:37,729
I hear it happened to Shelley too,
Shelley Baum, right before she died.

204
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:40,492
Well, thank you, Miss Raymond.

205
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,901
We'll check on that, and we'll contact you
if we need anything else.

206
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,373
What about the hard candies?

207
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:54,276
Both of these kids were eating them.
My sister too.

208
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:57,009
Three people eating hard candy
in two weeks?

209
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,780
The girl's right, Mickey. There's gotta be
some kind of connection here.

210
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:03,948
You know,
I'm really sorry about your sister.

211
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,390
But if it was my sister...

212
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:11,758
...I'd take some personal time,
just till I was thinking right again.

213
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,199
Excuse me, Miss Raymond?

214
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:22,105
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

215
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,973
I'm Detective Jack Andrews. I heard
what you were saying...

216
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,513
...and, well, Detective Lee's a good cop...

217
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:30,116
...but she's a little short
on imagination, you know?

218
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:33,220
- What are you saying?
- I don't really know.

219
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,449
Except Shelley Baum interned
with my sister at Saint Luke's.

220
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:41,323
My sister Jean, she died in a fall
two days before Shelley drowned.

221
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:44,124
Oh, I'm sorry.
But then, you see what I'm saying.

222
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,995
Everybody seems to be
linked together somehow.

223
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,899
Something doesn't make sense here so...

224
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,605
...if you can think of anything else,
give me a call.

225
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,373
You didn't get a call, did you?

226
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:14,654
But my number was in Brian's cell.

227
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,457
I'm gonna be next.

228
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,787
I can feel it.

229
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:25,023
No, you don't know that, okay?

230
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,567
Because my number is in Brian's cell too.
Here.

231
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,105
No power, no problem.

232
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:39,376
Any dead people call...

233
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,213
...we're not home.

234
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:22,852
- Which one is it?
- Uh!

235
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:35,460
Who?

236
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:57,120
Oh, God.

237
00:27:57,892 --> 00:27:59,189
Oh, God.

238
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,795
This can't be happening.

239
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:15,042
There are no batteries.

240
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,476
It says 8:32 p. m. On Friday.

241
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,211
That's two days from now.

242
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,664
Everything I'm seeing is there. It's real.

243
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,531
I'm seeing it and it's happening...

244
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:49,634
I do not. Okay?

245
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,315
Okay, you wanna delete it? Do it yourself.

246
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,180
Look, I'm... I'm sure you'll be fine.

247
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:06,660
I wanna do mine.
- You wanna do it too? Go ahead.

248
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,324
Go on, you can all do it.

249
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,367
There you go.

250
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,736
- That's a...
- Wait.

251
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,569
Sorry, ladies.
It just doesn't work that way.

252
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:27,408
Right. You're telling me
that we can't cancel the service?

253
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:30,016
You don't have to cancel.
Just use up your minutes.

254
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,621
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
We don't wanna use this phone at all.

255
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:37,588
Well, the phone is yours, so you
can do whatever you want with it.

256
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,418
Miss Anthony?

257
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,218
- Taylor Anthony?
- Yeah.

258
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,189
Ted Summers.

259
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:17,923
<i>I'm a television producer. I work
on the program American Miracles.</i>

260
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,430
Oh, I've heard of that.

261
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,132
Yeah.

262
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,395
Some students called us
about what happened...

263
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,539
...and they told us
all about your problem.

264
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:30,041
- Can we help you with something? We're...
- We were very moved by your story, Taylor.

265
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:33,669
- We think we might be able to help you.
- How?

266
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:38,512
About five years ago,
my son suffered a possession.

267
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:45,356
Yeah. It was pretty devastating
for the whole family.

268
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:49,258
So when I created my show,
I wanted to make it a point...

269
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,263
...to build an extensive resource
of people who were able...

270
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:56,961
...to deal successfully
with those evil influences like that.

271
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:59,470
What do you mean,
like, you do exorcisms?

272
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:03,509
- I think this is nonsense.
- Do you have the telephone on you, Taylor?

273
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:07,444
- What? No, we threw it away.
- Do you have the phone?

274
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,312
Well, it would really be helpful.
Here. Here.

275
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,716
Now, you show me...

276
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:16,322
...exactly what happened
when the phone call came in.

277
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:18,118
Okay, come here. Nope, nope.

278
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,818
Thank you very much.
This is ridiculous. Thank you.

279
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:23,125
- We don't need a reality show.
- I understand...

280
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,163
...you wanna protect your friend.
- I do.

281
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,594
- I admire that.
- Thank you.

282
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,507
- Come on, let's go.
- Jesus.

283
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,644
Come on, come on.

284
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:48,521
Wait, we could s...

285
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,982
Hey, maybe he could help me, Beth.

286
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,324
No, Taylor, you don't need an exorcism.
Okay?

287
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,227
That guy was so full of it.

288
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,313
Andrews.

289
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:48,068
Miss Raymond, it is not your
imagination. The phone calls happened.

290
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,938
The other detective said
nobody could find the voice mails.

291
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,411
Because the other detective
didn't bother to check the phone records.

292
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:56,447
I did, and it's all right there.

293
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:01,179
Brian was called by Leann, Leann
was called by Shelley, and Shelley...

294
00:34:01,355 --> 00:34:03,380
...was called from my sister.

295
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:07,324
All right? And all the calls came in
after the caller was already dead.

296
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:09,292
Right. Who called your sister?

297
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,797
If we could trace it to the source
and find out who started this, then...

298
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,629
I was up all night tracking it.
I'm gonna go see her now.

299
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,412
- I'll give you a call. Okay?
- Okay.

300
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,904
- I'm gonna come with you.
- That's not a good idea.

301
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:24,773
Yeah, it is, because these are my friends
and there's no way I'm gonna sit here.

302
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:30,112
The call my sister got
came from a nurse at an old-age home.

303
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:31,717
A woman named Marie Layton.

304
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,789
It's right up here on the right.

305
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:51,698
I wouldn't hold my breath.

306
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:55,434
Nobody's been in there for
more than two weeks now, not a soul.

307
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,601
Okay. Thank you very much.

308
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,117
You know, I'm gonna go get the super.

309
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:15,926
That could take hours.
Why don't you just break in?

310
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,725
I'm a cop.

311
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,533
I'm not.

312
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,630
All right, give it a shot.

313
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:36,640
Okay.

314
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,417
I was getting it.

315
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:12,545
Well, whoever Marie Layton is,
she's a hell of a housekeeper, huh?

316
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:28,596
<i>We're not... We're not...
We're not... We're not...</i>

317
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:26,348
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

318
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:35,289
I found this in the living room.

319
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,363
It must be one of those nanny cams.

320
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:42,327
To keep an eye on the children.

321
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:53,140
Okay, so judging from the angle, the
camera would have been right here.

322
00:38:57,718 --> 00:38:59,549
So where did it go?

323
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:22,866
Beth.

324
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,377
Look, if you don't talk to me,
I can't help you.

325
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:31,416
That noise, the inhaler. I heard it
both times, before Leann and Brian...

326
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:34,145
Then when I looked behind me,
there was nobody there.

327
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,889
What the hell is happening?

328
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:42,193
This is the morgue file of the dead
from the last month or so.

329
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,888
If Marie Layton died,
she did it in another city.

330
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:47,830
I don't know how you stand
looking at this stuff.

331
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:50,971
The dead ones don't really
bother me so much.

332
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,299
Now take a look at this. All right.

333
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,534
It's not a Marie Layton,
but an Ellie Layton.

334
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,309
That's the older daughter
from the photograph.

335
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,211
Yeah. It says she died of an asthma attack
in her apartment.

336
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:05,409
There's a CPS report attached too.

337
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:10,180
Child Protective Services.
Was she an abuse victim?

338
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:14,487
It says her mother was questioned
by a psychiatric nurse at...

339
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:18,026
...Saint Luke's.
- Your sister.

340
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:23,460
Wanna give me a hand with those?
Yeah, sure.

341
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:26,501
Make sure Jesus is centered, all right?

342
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,336
Let's go, people! Let's go!

343
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,876
Hey, Gary, this is a great place.

344
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:34,606
I have a feeling
it's gonna be a terrific show.

345
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:38,013
- How's our girl doing, huh?
Not bad.

346
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,048
This is Beth. I'm calling for Taylor.

347
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:49,390
Taylor, when you get this,
will you call me, please? Thanks.

348
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:53,294
Jean's papers. I haven't had a chance
to go through them yet...

349
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:57,700
...but she kept records of everything
in case she had to go to court...

350
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,737
...so it's gotta be in here someplace.

351
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,413
She was the baby.
I was supposed to look out for her.

352
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,077
I'm sorry.

353
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,921
Is this it?

354
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:31,796
It says Marie Layton...

355
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:35,169
...checked her daughter Ellie
into the hospital for an asthma attack.

356
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:38,277
And here's the little one, Laurel,
stuck a needle in her hand.

357
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:43,178
Laurel, insect bites, a burn on her leg.
Ellie, another asthma attack.

358
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,879
Okay, Laurel again,
pesticide in her eye.

359
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:49,488
Here's another one.
Laurel ingested detergent.

360
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:50,749
And there, another burn.

361
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:53,925
Look at that. That's nine admissions
in April and May alone.

362
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:57,529
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

363
00:41:57,965 --> 00:42:00,900
It's when a mother wants attention,
so she hurts her children...

364
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:02,399
...so they need medical help.

365
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,936
But there's no way
she could've given Ellie asthma.

366
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,006
No, but she could have exposed her
to something to set it off.

367
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:10,575
So Ellie has an asthma attack and dies.

368
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:13,269
My sister starts asking questions.

369
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,041
Marie gets nervous
she's gonna be found out...

370
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:18,048
...so she takes Laurel and disappears.

371
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,053
I'm gonna go get Missing Persons on this.

372
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,857
<i>A cell phone rings
and Death is on the line.</i>

373
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,591
<i>A beautiful coed,
a ticking clock of ghostly murder.</i>

374
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,998
<i>Next, American Miracles takes you there
as a famed exorcist...</i>

375
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:40,937
<i>...tries to outrace the mysterious curse
that has already claimed two lives.</i>

376
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:46,946
Spiritual energy exists
in the same electromagnetic spectrum...

377
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:48,843
...as light or microwaves.

378
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,816
It's no surprise
it can travel through cellular phones.

379
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:57,490
And it grows there, like a seed...

380
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:03,622
...where it eventually manifests as
hallucinations, spiritual disturbances...

381
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:05,492
...and finally death.

382
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,395
For you, darling.

383
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:10,036
<i>Taylor, it's Beth.
Hey, Beth.</i>

384
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:12,001
Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

385
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,606
It's okay. Hold on.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

386
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:17,107
No. It's gonna work out. I know it.

387
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:20,509
- No, Taylor, listen to me.
- There's nothing else I can do.

388
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,510
- Shit.
Okay, everybody, here we go.

389
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,211
Quiet, please. And four, three, two...

390
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:30,180
We cast out this unclean spirit.

391
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:34,952
Depart from here, Satan.

392
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:37,620
Depart, every demonic power...

393
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:40,358
...every infernal adversary, every legion.

394
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:42,399
I command you.

395
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:44,935
I command you in the name of God...

396
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:50,065
...in the names of all his heavenly
angels, to be gone from this cell phone.

397
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:51,638
I command you...

398
00:43:51,812 --> 00:43:56,272
...by the judge of the living and the
dead, you will leave my sister alone.

399
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,712
Come out, I say, in Jesus' name!

400
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:00,415
You serpent!

401
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:02,587
Devil!

402
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:05,151
In the name of Jesus of Nazareth...

403
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:08,557
<i>...you will haunt this child of God
no more:</i>

404
00:44:10,497 --> 00:44:13,728
Stop tormenting my sister.
You will come out now!

405
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,267
I am calling you by name, Satan.

406
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:26,135
Come out. Show yourself!

407
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:35,149
Depart. Depart this place. Depart.

408
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:37,414
Hey, hey, you guys, take it easy.
I'm a cop.

409
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,042
Keep rolling. Keep rolling.

410
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:15,428
Taylor? Taylor.

411
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,094
Taylor.

412
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,516
Beth, hey. You okay? Yeah?

413
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:50,824
Everybody back off.

414
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:56,494
Did you get that, huh?
Please tell me you got it.

415
00:45:56,737 --> 00:45:57,965
Huh?

416
00:45:58,705 --> 00:45:59,694
Ah...

417
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:23,626
Tomorrow.

418
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,558
You weren't there, Mickey.
You didn't see this.

419
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:29,293
- This girl needs protection.
- From what?

420
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:33,702
The ghost in her cell phone?
Tell her to call customer service.

421
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:36,065
Jack, Mickey's got a point.

422
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:38,768
Best use of people here
is we find the doer.

423
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:40,602
Yeah.

424
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:43,279
You're doing a great job so far.

425
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,470
<i>Voice call received...</i>

426
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:19,585
<i>Saturday, June 17th, 7:55 p. m.</i>

427
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:22,515
<i>Why?</i>

428
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:25,852
<i>Please, just tell me why.</i>

429
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:43,537
Look, are you sure you wanna stay here?
Maybe you could stay with family instead?

430
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,106
- Well, my father's dead.
- Well, what about your mother?

431
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:52,884
She and I don't talk very much.

432
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,586
- You don't have to stay.
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

433
00:47:57,758 --> 00:47:59,487
I'm not going anywhere.

434
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:18,939
Look, this isn't over yet.

435
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,404
All right?

436
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:26,846
- There's still time to figure this out.
- Not before 7:55 tonight.

437
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,155
- Jesus. Beth, what happened here?
- Oh!

438
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:43,468
How old were you
when you got those?

439
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:45,832
Seven? Eight?

440
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,310
Was it your mother?

441
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,175
Did your father know?

442
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:02,886
When I call you, I expect you to come.
Do you hear me?

443
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:06,751
Do...

444
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:08,585
<i>:::you:::</i>

445
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:10,120
...hear me?

446
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,610
My father knew.

447
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:37,854
<i>Cry, baby, cry</i>

448
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:39,720
You're disgusting.

449
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:43,396
Go ahead. Go cry to your father.

450
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:03,278
Daddy?

451
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:09,854
Daddy?

452
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:55,732
Hello.

453
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:58,802
Yeah. Okay.

454
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,139
Where?

455
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,740
All right. All right, thanks.

456
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:08,573
That was Missing Persons.
They found Laurel. She's in a foster home.

457
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:13,178
She was at Saint Luke's
when it caught fire.

458
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:16,015
- Wait. So she was still at the hospital?
- Yes.

459
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:20,319
She'd cut her arm, and there'd been
a report to Child Protective Services.

460
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,894
They were holding her
until she could be examined.

461
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:25,258
What about her mother?
Do you know where she is?

462
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,266
She hasn't been seen since the fire.

463
00:51:30,203 --> 00:51:34,037
- Well, do you think we could talk to
Laurel? - You can try.

464
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:44,480
Laurel? There are some people here
to see you.

465
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:53,522
Hi, Laurel. My name's Jack.

466
00:51:57,264 --> 00:51:59,425
It's a cute little teddy bear you got there.

467
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:04,396
Does your teddy bear have a name?

468
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,305
She hasn't spoken since the fire.

469
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,367
Laurel, listen to me.

470
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,014
It's very important
that we find your mother.

471
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:17,241
Do you know where she is right now?

472
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,482
Laurel, do you know
where your mother went?

473
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,017
Do you know where she is?

474
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,836
Do you think there's maybe
some way that you could talk to her?

475
00:52:38,004 --> 00:52:40,495
L...
You wanna try talking to her?

476
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:50,077
What's wrong?
It's just the song the bear plays.

477
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:54,751
Laurel, honey?

478
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,981
Honey, do you know
where your mother is?

479
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,786
Laurel?

480
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,222
Can you tell...? Look at me.

481
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:04,420
Can you tell us? Do you know?
Can you say something?

482
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:07,256
Where is your mother? Goddamn it.

483
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,665
Oh, that was great, you know?
You really have a way with kids.

484
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:18,174
We have four hours left.
We're not gonna find her in time.

485
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:20,336
Yes, we will.
The first thing we'll do...

486
00:53:20,513 --> 00:53:23,175
...is go downtown
and hit the department computers.

487
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:25,841
Everybody leaves a trail,
ATM machines, credit cards.

488
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:27,932
- We'll track Marie that way.
- You do that.

489
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:31,683
I'll find out about the fire at Saint
Luke's. Everything seems to start there.

490
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:34,520
Are you out of your mind?
Don't even think about that.

491
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:38,653
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- We'll get more done if we split up, okay?

492
00:53:38,832 --> 00:53:41,357
And I'm safe until 7:55 p. m.

493
00:53:41,768 --> 00:53:43,201
All right.

494
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:46,163
- I'll meet you at the library at 7 sharp.
- Okay.

495
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:48,569
Here, take my other phone.

496
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:51,410
Call me if you need me.

497
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,248
<i>Dr. Nelson, please report to
Cardiology.</i>

498
00:55:10,423 --> 00:55:12,254
<i>Dr. Nelson, please report...</i>

499
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:15,588
- Can you ask him to hurry, please?
- I've already called him twice.

500
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:21,165
- Miss Raymond. Mm-hm.
- Dr. Painter? I need your help.

501
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:24,094
You were the doctor
on the children's ward...

502
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,465
...the day of the fire
at Saint Luke's Hospital?

503
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:27,663
- That's right.
- Okay.

504
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:30,776
Do you remember a little girl,
Laurel Layton? She was 6.

505
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:34,311
She had cut herself and you made her
stay there so the CPS could investigate.

506
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:38,307
Shit.

507
00:55:38,485 --> 00:55:40,851
Sure, I remember her.
Her sister had just died...

508
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:43,080
...and one of the nurses
filled out a report.

509
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,848
Right. Do you remember her mother?

510
00:55:45,025 --> 00:55:48,654
Was her mother there when the fire
started? It was during visiting hours?

511
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:52,195
That wouldn't have made a difference.
The mother was there all the time.

512
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:11,540
Excuse me. I'm looking for a student,
her name is Beth.

513
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:13,510
She was supposed to be here
earlier today.

514
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,812
Where are you?

515
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:19,081
I think Marie Layton was in the hospital
when it burned down.

516
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:21,056
I think that she might've died there.

517
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:23,252
Impossible. All the bodies were identified.

518
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:27,025
I know, but what if they didn't find her?
What if her body's still inside?

519
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,967
<i>She was a sick woman, a child abuser.
What if her body is still inside...</i>

520
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,902
...and her spirit's there,
moving through the phones...

521
00:56:35,075 --> 00:56:36,337
...attacking people?

522
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:40,972
Okay, all right. Where are you?
I'll come get you.

523
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:46,477
Well, here we are, miss, Saint Luke's.

524
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,553
<i>What's left of it, anyway.</i>

525
00:56:48,692 --> 00:56:51,256
<i>Beth, no! Wait for me, all right?
I'm on my way.</i>

526
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:53,452
Hurry, there's not much time.

527
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:19,914
Shit!

528
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:00,631
- It's okay, it's okay.
- She's coming for me. She's coming.

529
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,768
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- She's coming.

530
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,969
No! No!

531
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,152
What the hell is that?

532
01:02:26,025 --> 01:02:27,390
Come on, let's go!

533
01:02:31,931 --> 01:02:34,058
- Try those doors right there.
- Uhn!

534
01:03:09,902 --> 01:03:11,802
Jack!

535
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:13,563
Jack!

536
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:38,694
No!

537
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:25,003
Beth!

538
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,556
Please don't hurt me.

539
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,925
Please.

540
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:43,703
Forgive me.

541
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:47,374
Why?

542
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:49,976
Why?

543
01:08:23,415 --> 01:08:25,383
She had to be the first.

544
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:29,120
She had to have my sister's number
stored in her cell phone.

545
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:33,323
I know what she was,
but I have this feeling that she...

546
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,788
...brought me here or something
to protect me.

547
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,731
Otherwise, why am I still alive?

548
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:58,473
Broken pile ready to go?
Yeah.

549
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,348
Do you wanna come in?

550
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:40,485
No, I've gotta go tell Laurel
that her mother's gone.

551
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:43,253
Besides, you look like
you could use some rest.

552
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,521
Yeah.

553
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:49,891
Maybe you could call me sometime.

554
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:51,664
How about tomorrow?

555
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:54,767
Tomorrow would be nice.

556
01:11:12,785 --> 01:11:16,619
It's just as well.
I'll tell her myself in the morning.

557
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,729
What is it?
- That's Laurel's, isn't it?

558
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,733
It looks like hers.
Yeah, that's the teddy bear.

559
01:11:46,485 --> 01:11:48,077
It's a nanny cam.

560
01:11:48,354 --> 01:11:51,084
Records what goes on in the kid's room.

561
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:04,526
<i>We'll come in here...</i>

562
01:12:05,204 --> 01:12:08,139
<i>...and sit you down.</i>

563
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:12,107
Now, be a nice little girl.

564
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:37,935
Oh, my God.

565
01:12:46,211 --> 01:12:49,374
Now, this will only hurt a little.

566
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:52,975
Hey, guys...

567
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,688
Get away from her!

568
01:13:06,065 --> 01:13:07,794
It was you.

569
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,366
It was you the whole time.

570
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,635
I should've known.

571
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,104
<i>Mama!</i>

572
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,042
<i>Please, help me! Mama!</i>

573
01:13:28,253 --> 01:13:29,481
Mama!

574
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,726
Hi, Laurel. It wasn't
your mother who hurt you.

575
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,505
It was your sister, Ellie, wasn't it?

576
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:55,636
But she always gave me candy.

577
01:14:58,777 --> 01:15:01,974
- More stuff from the hospital?
- Yep. CSU will go through it tomorrow.

578
01:15:02,147 --> 01:15:04,172
- See you later.
- Yeah. Take it easy, man.

579
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:04,904
<i>Voice call received Saturday, June
17th...</i>

580
01:16:05,077 --> 01:16:07,204
<i>...11 p. m.</i>

581
01:16:11,216 --> 01:16:12,649
<i>No.</i>

582
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,877
<i>No, wait. Wait, no!</i>

583
01:16:21,226 --> 01:16:23,922
<i>I... I just thought
you should hear this, Jack.</i>

584
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:25,787
<i>Jack?</i>

585
01:16:44,249 --> 01:16:46,274
Come on. Come on, pick up.

586
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:54,919
<i>Hi. No one's home, leave us a
message.</i>

587
01:16:55,927 --> 01:16:59,556
Beth, listen, okay?
Marie wasn't the first, it w...

588
01:17:03,802 --> 01:17:05,793
So, look, you were right.

589
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:09,099
Marie wasn't trying to kill you
at the hospital. She was trying...

590
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,775
<i>...to protect you, all right?</i>

591
01:17:10,776 --> 01:17:13,506
<i>She was trying to
keep her daughter away from you.</i>

592
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:17,913
Call me.

593
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,982
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

594
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:06,852
Look, it wasn't Marie, all right?

595
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:09,808
The whole time it was Ellie.
She made the very first phone call.

596
01:19:11,797 --> 01:19:13,560
What's that?

597
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,948
No. No, wait. No!

598
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:39,716
No!

599
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,420
Aah!
