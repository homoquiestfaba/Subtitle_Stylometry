1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,672
Ward, I'm very worried
about Beaver.

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,411
Mom's favorite vase.

3
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,283
She always says,
"Don't play ball in the house."

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,582
Sit on it, Fonzie.

5
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:23,815
Hey!.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,915
What about me, Mallory?

7
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,857
What about my feelings?

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,157
Hey, I knew everything
would be all right.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,822
Dyno-mite!.

10
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,393
During the '70s, millions
huddled in front of their TVs

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,133
to watch the frothy antics
of The Glimmer Gang.

12
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,607
Little Dickie Roberts
formed the center of the show,

13
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,303
and his crooked smile

14
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,312
and casually tossed off
catch phrases

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,406
became the fad of a nation
longing for escapism.

16
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,451
This is his story.

17
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,077
Peggy Roberts
had only one goal in life--

18
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,453
to be in showbiz.

19
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,752
And when she got pregnant,

20
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,690
she felt like
it only slowed her down.

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,785
Peggy never said for sure
who the father was,

22
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,193
but the most persistent rumor

23
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,425
concluded
that it was David Soul,

24
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,933
the talented, hunky actor
from Starsky and Hutch.

25
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,061
Don't give up on us, baby...

26
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,402
And on July 2, 1967,

27
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,499
Dickie Roberts
came into the world.

28
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,306
Peggy began auditioning him
for acting parts almost daily.

29
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,371
Here's Peggy Roberts
in a 1989 interview.

30
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,643
When it came to auditions,

31
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,651
I used to dress him up
for the part, whatever it was.

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,118
I mean, if they wanted a cowboy,

33
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,247
they got a cowboy.

34
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,781
Even if they wanted a girl,
I'd give them one.

35
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,521
Do you know that he once
auditioned

36
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,721
for Pippi Longstocking?

37
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,594
And he got the part.

38
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,463
I felt so stupid
walking into an office

39
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,263
holding the kid's hand.

40
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,328
It was rough on me.

41
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,067
Then, in 1972, when NBC

42
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,166
created a show called
The Glimmer Gang,

43
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,904
Dickie was cast immediately.

44
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,878
The show became
an instant success

45
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,643
and soon Dickie's picture
was plastered on magazines,

46
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,240
Iunch boxes and board games.

47
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,912
And his trademark catch phrase
was everywhere.

48
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,453
This is Nucking Futs!

49
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,122
But after six years of success,
the ratings began to slip.

50
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,855
And just as fast as the Dickie
phenomenon exploded,

51
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,556
it was over.

52
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,326
Dickie's mother,
soon after, left him

53
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,696
and moved out of the area.

54
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,564
He found himself alone.

55
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,501
Here's former Eight is Enough
star Dick Van Patten.

56
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,768
Stardom is really hard
on child actors,

57
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,607
and when you throw in a horrible
stage mother like Peggy Roberts,

58
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,476
poor little Dickie
had no chance.

59
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,539
Nobody would hire
the troubled actor,

60
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,051
and pictures surfaced
of Dickie's odd behavior--

61
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,314
including compulsive
glove wearing.

62
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,516
He had his name legally changed
to "David Soul's Son."

63
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,491
Then, tired of explaining
who David Soul was,

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,154
he tried "Hutch's Son."

65
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,526
Later, he changed it again

66
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,791
to the element chart symbols

67
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,958
for fluorine,
titanium and zinc.

68
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:50,960
Today, Dickie Roberts

69
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,867
is certain
that a showbiz comeback

70
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,201
is in the cards for him.

71
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,401
He is working
as a valet parking cars.

72
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,239
But as everybody knows,

73
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,407
in Hollywood, sometimes your
dreams can come true... again.

74
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,684
This is the story
of Dickie Roberts,

75
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,812
the E! True Hollywood Story..

76
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,322
Hi, everybody, welcome back
to celebrity boxing

77
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,723
with our special
"Quake at the Lake" edition.

78
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,454
Tonight's going
to be an amazing fight.

79
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,927
Our main event is about to begin

80
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,930
and is going to be
the clash of the titans.

81
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,490
Former Webster star
Emmanuel Lewis goes toe-to-toe

82
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,367
with former Glimmer Gang star
Dickie Roberts.

83
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,929
Coming to the ring
in the white trunks,

84
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,838
from The Glimmer Gang,

85
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,843
Dickie...

86
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,175
Roberts!

87
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,064
And now, his opponent,

88
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,964
wearing black trunks,

89
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,969
standing four feet,
three inches,

90
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,629
weighing 92 pounds,

91
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:05,041
Emmanuel... Lewis!

92
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,026
It's Lewis time.

93
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,029
Lewis time, baby.

94
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,087
It's Lewis, you understand me?

95
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,097
Right now.

96
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,930
Tonight, Lewis time.
Lewis time.

97
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,732
Uh-oh, look.

98
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,069
Lewis, Lewis, Lewis...

99
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,133
When was this guy in the joint?

100
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,308
-You suck.
-Huh?

101
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,280
-What did she just say?
-Did you hear that?

102
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,152
Get down there!

103
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,789
Ow! Let's be friends!

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,864
Yeah!

105
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,265
Where you going?

106
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,098
I liked your show.

107
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,636
Off the mat, sir.

108
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,112
-I'm throwing in the towel.
-No, no, no.

109
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,318
The winner,
Celebrity K.O. Champion...

110
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,891
The winner!

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,935
I can't believe this.

112
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,130
Uh... what am I doing here?

113
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,037
Come on, Cyndi,
it's just a flat tire.

114
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,075
We'll get it fixed.

115
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,042
Then we'll be back home
to Hollywood.

116
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,135
I like your hat.

117
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,236
Shut up.

118
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,746
First, you get your ass kicked

119
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,249
by some guy
who's half your size...

120
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,251
I-I think he's on the juice.

121
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,911
No, I think you're just a puss.

122
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,285
Look, we're broke, okay?

123
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,949
Maybe now might be a good time

124
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,219
to try to sell
that stupid autobiography

125
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,386
you write all the time.

126
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,896
I-I can't publish
this right now,

127
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,521
because it ends up with me
being a loser.

128
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,066
I have to wait to publish it

129
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,898
until I'm back on top,
which I will be soon, I swear.

130
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,766
I'm going to have
a big comeback.

131
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,670
There's something
you got to face, baby.

132
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,732
Okay, there's not going
to be any comeback.

133
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,174
Yes, there will be.

134
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,735
Yes, there will be, I know it.

135
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,007
So pathetic.

136
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,605
There has to be!

137
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:25,349
Dickie!

138
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,612
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

139
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,621
Grab it! Whoa, no!

140
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,427
Maybe we can drive it
out of here.

141
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,397
Does insurance cover that?

142
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,300
What, being a moron?

143
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,804
No, they squeeze out of it

144
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,807
with that
Act of An ldiot clause.

145
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,577
Ooh, here comes a car.

146
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,633
All right, now you get in

147
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,577
and then stall them
so I can get in, too.

148
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,241
Yeah, I know the drill, champ.

149
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,316
Hey.

150
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,220
Where you going, stud?

151
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,088
It's up to you, sweetheart.

152
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,661
Hey, wait!

153
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,163
Cyndi, open up!

154
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,165
Cyndi, come on!

155
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,962
What are you doing?

156
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,073
Come on, I'll be a star again.

157
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,858
Dickie.

158
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,294
Leif, wow, how you doing?

159
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,358
How are you, man?

160
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,426
Good to see you.

161
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,496
Oh, my God.
You're Leif Garrett.

162
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,098
I used to have
such a crush on you.

163
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,301
Can I have your autograph?

164
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,434
Sure.

165
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,342
You guys want my autograph, too?
Dickie Roberts?

166
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,005
No, I'm fine.

167
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,343
How about if I put it
on a $5 bill?

168
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,678
Make it a $20?

169
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,309
Thanks.

170
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,648
They're sweet.

171
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,712
So, Dickie, how you been?
What's up?

172
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,987
Just got back from
a very successful TV stint.

173
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,325
No such thing
as bad press, right?

174
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,388
Unless it's that.

175
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,593
So, Leif, what have
you been up to?

176
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,695
I got a record out
that I'm happy about.

177
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:27,739
Rock and roll, man.

178
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,037
Went on an acting audition
about three months ago.

179
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,041
Well, that's great man.

180
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,907
I've been going on movie
auditions all the time,

181
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,139
Iike every day.

182
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,181
Hey, you going to read
for Mr. Blake's Backyard?

183
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,012
I definitely am.

184
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,381
I was... where...

185
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,510
What-What's that one again?

186
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,746
Rob Reiner's new film?

187
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,254
It's the talk of the town.

188
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,584
Yes, Rob Reiner.

189
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,181
My God, did his dog
have puppies yet?

190
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,851
Ooh, I should send him a note.

191
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,758
You know what,
I have to call him anyway.

192
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,456
I left my sweater
in his guest room.

193
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,055
It's called
Mr. Blake's Backyard?

194
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,100
Remember how Frank Sinatra
in his comeback

195
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,930
played Maggio
in From Here to Eternity,

196
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,060
and then won the Oscar?

197
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,968
Or like Travolta
in Pulp Fiction?

198
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,870
It's the role of a lifetime,
man.

199
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,236
Great.
Leif, I got to go.

200
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,742
It was good to see you, man.

201
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,779
Hey, are we still on
for poker Thursday?

202
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,871
Sidney, where are you?

203
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,847
I've left three messages.

204
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,148
Listen, there's this new movie,
it's a Rob Reiner movie.

205
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,152
You got to get me in...

206
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,153
-Dickie.
-Go to go.

207
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,450
Are you going
to park cars or what?

208
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,547
They're stacking up.

209
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,613
Yes, sir, Mr. Rollins.

210
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,125
Look, Dickie, the only
reason I hired you

211
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,217
is I used to watch your show,

212
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,523
and your life
is kind of pathetic.

213
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,756
Thanks for being a fan.

214
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,601
You know what?

215
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,869
You never get anywhere unless
you bend the rules a little bit.

216
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,034
Woo-hoo.

217
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,277
Uh, this is the Wernick Agency.

218
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,716
This is his assistant...
Shaquikwa speaking.

219
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,253
Sidney, where the hell
have you been?

220
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,583
I've been calling all morning.

221
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,622
Oh, sorry.

222
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,181
Hey, you know those pigeons
I feed?

223
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,092
They attacked me,
six of the bastards.

224
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,062
I had to go get stitches.

225
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,893
Wait a second, wait a second.

226
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,727
Oh, come on,
what is this guy doing?

227
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,633
Hey, move that pile.

228
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,569
The light ain't getting
any greener, jarhead.

229
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,571
Hey, screw you, man.

230
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,403
Why don't you step
out of that little,

231
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,067
bitty wussy car
and talk to my face, huh?

232
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,235
Hey, screw you.

233
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,944
I'll kick your
steroid-loving ass, moron.

234
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,346
Jujube.

235
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,145
I'm going to bust you up, man.

236
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,187
Smell you later, stink bomb.

237
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,516
I'll find you.

238
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,955
Three, G, Q...

239
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,151
Hey, Dickie, aren't you worried
about that guy

240
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,525
tracking you down and beating
the crap out of you?

241
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,793
No, I'm in someone else's car,
plus the windows are tinted.

242
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,356
Hey, listen, this movie part

243
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,402
sounds like
the key to everything, man.

244
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,938
You've got to get me in
to see Rob Reiner.

245
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,372
And as your agent,
let me ask you this--

246
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,703
you got any ideas?

247
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,836
'Cause, I mean, that's just
way out of our league.

248
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,573
Now, you want
to get on Elimidate,

249
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,979
that's a different story.

250
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,981
I think if I talk
to some movie stars,

251
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,346
they can help me.

252
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,944
Yeah, you, where are you
going to meet movie stars?

253
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,455
Oh, man, that's the easy part.

254
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:01,926
So, I woke up in a boxcar
outside Lincoln, Nebraska.

255
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,519
All right, it was
5:00 in the morning.

256
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,030
Hey, Tom Arnold, what's up?

257
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,259
Hey, hey, it's Tom "A"
in here, okay?

258
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,926
And keep quiet;
it's just getting good.

259
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,503
She's a cross-addicted
sex addict.

260
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,537
Ooh.

261
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,233
And I realized
that I had hit bottom.

262
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,467
I hit bottom.

263
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,804
I see you on TV all the time.

264
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,572
You're doing great.
Listen, what's up?

265
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,942
Hey, Orville and Wilbur called.

266
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,172
They want to buy your collars.

267
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,648
They're going to take off
from Kitty Hawk at sundown.

268
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,378
What does that mean?

269
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,352
They invented the airplane,

270
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,946
and your lapels
are unusually huge.

271
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,955
That's funny.

272
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,956
Yeah.

273
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,957
Or is it?

274
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,493
I can bench-press 350 pounds.

275
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,892
That's great.
That's a lot.

276
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,190
Hey, man, I see you everywhere.

277
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,196
You're kicking ass.

278
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,197
True Lies was great.

279
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,198
I rent it all the time.

280
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,757
Can you get me in
with Rob Reiner?

281
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,325
Excuse me. Sir?

282
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,870
Can we help you?

283
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,236
Are you here
because you're an alcoholic?

284
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,706
Whoa. No. No. Baby.

285
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,766
Don't get that
floating around town.

286
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,869
Last thing I need
is people to think

287
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,607
I'm some drunk, alkie loser.

288
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,617
Not that it's bad.
I mean, it's cool.

289
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,710
You need to be
an alcoholic to be here.

290
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,221
All right.

291
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,851
Aw, there's got to be another AA
meeting around here somewhere.

292
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,654
Bingo. I'll take Brendan Fraser
to block.

293
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,934
Whew! Sorry I'm late, gang,
but I am wasted.

294
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,564
Drinking shots like a madman.

295
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,302
I'm chocked,
cocked and crapulous.

296
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,900
You know what I mean?

297
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,310
One tequila, two tequila,
three tequila, floor.

298
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,404
Right? Who's with me?

299
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,642
This guy knows what I'm saying.

300
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,708
Can we help you?

301
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,412
Oh, God, I hope you can.

302
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,284
My name's Dickie Roberts,

303
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,222
and I'm a whiskey-puking alkie.

304
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,952
Well, that's all
very interesting,

305
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,926
but this is a Lamaze class.

306
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,487
Oh. Okay. Nice to see you.

307
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,557
I'm telling this story
to everybody I see.

308
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,297
That's got to be the dumbest
thing I've ever witnessed.

309
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,633
Maybe it was.

310
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,698
But listen, what are you doing
in Lamaze class anyway?

311
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,107
Is your wife pregnant?

312
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,576
Yeah.
My wife is pregnant.

313
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,340
Here she is now.
Have you met?

314
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,108
-Uh... no.
-Actually, we have.

315
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,377
Three years ago, you hit on me,
and I shot you down,

316
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,248
and then you stole my number
from a friend.

317
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,152
You know that we've been married
more than three years, right?

318
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,087
And then you drunk-dialed me,

319
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,092
Iike, 30 times,
trying to hook up

320
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,627
some sort of booty call.

321
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,924
Yes, right. What's up?

322
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,487
Anyway, I got to pee.

323
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,430
Nice to see you.

324
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,934
Yes. Good to see you again.

325
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,937
Anyway, Brendan,
I'm a big fan and...

326
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,233
And you think
that you could score

327
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,742
if I got you an audition
for Mr. Blake's Backyard?

328
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,403
Oh, my God. Of course.

329
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,174
Yeah, I can make a phone call
for you. Is it Rob Reiner?

330
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,215
Oh, my God!
I love Brendan Frazier.

331
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,113
Fraser.

332
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,151
It is Fraser.

333
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,186
It's Fraser.
Why do people say...?

334
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,363
So, my good buddy--

335
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,954
maybe you've heard of him-

336
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,364
Jorge of the Jungle--
Brendan Frazier.

337
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,492
Oh, you heard me.

338
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,831
I didn't stutter.

339
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,361
Brendan Frazier is
going to make a call--

340
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,704
hook me up with Rob Reiner.

341
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,141
Did Mr. Frazier call you?

342
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,906
I'll believe it when I see it.

343
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,843
Okay, I raise ten bucks.

344
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,347
Actually, one buck

345
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,044
and the original
braces that Marcia wore

346
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,915
in the "Brace Yourself"
episode--

347
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,421
easily worth
nine bucks on eBay.

348
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,218
Gross. I'm in.

349
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,155
All right, I'm in.

350
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,023
All right,
speaking of big stars,

351
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,427
anybody see who People Magazine
gave "Sexiest Man Alive" to?

352
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,022
George Clooney.
Don't get it.

353
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,829
George Clooney?
That doesn't make sense.

354
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:30,869
Who is voting on that stuff?

355
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,665
You know what, though?

356
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,070
George Clooney is a great star.

357
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,370
He's huge, and deservedly so.

358
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,578
I loved that boat movie.

359
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,581
You know who I don't
get is Brad Pitt.

360
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,241
Yeah, what's up with Brad Pitt?

361
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,410
Brad Pitt changes
his hair every day.

362
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,954
Are girls really into guys
with great hair,

363
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,115
pretty faces
and built like a truck?

364
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,354
-Yeah.
-Actually, yeah.

365
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,394
You know, one time,

366
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,657
someone thought I was
Brad Pitt from the side.

367
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,097
Yeah, I know, like, 20 people
who thought you were a girl

368
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,292
and not from the side.

369
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,598
Watch it.

370
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,103
I raise two bucks

371
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:10,608
with this authentic replica
of the jinxed

372
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,644
Tiki idol
from the Brady episode

373
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,803
"Hawaii Bound."

374
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,904
Easily worth two bucks on eBay.

375
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,448
I am out.

376
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,448
Yeah, I'm out.

377
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,381
I'm out.

378
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,476
There's your two.

379
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,885
And you know who I don't get?
Vin Diesel.

380
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,321
Oh, yes!

381
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,585
Who's Vin Diesel?

382
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,853
Is he good-looking?

383
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,725
I mean, I don't know
what's going on with him.

384
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,559
Is he Chinese?
I don't know.

385
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,121
That's so horrible, man.

386
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,257
You're such a dick.

387
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,892
Besides, he'd kick your ass.

388
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,266
Come on, Dickie.

389
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,895
How jealous can you get, really?

390
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,904
It's getting bad.

391
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,167
Vin Diesel's actually
a cool guy.

392
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,607
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

393
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,872
He actually lent me money once.

394
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,177
I just want to be a star again
so goddamn bad.

395
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,944
What's the thing
you miss the most, Dickie?

396
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,416
You know what?
It's not the limos.

397
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,180
Oh, I miss the limos.

398
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,246
It's not the girls,
the money, the parties...

399
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,452
The girls, the money,
the parties...

400
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,688
No, wait.
Seriously, you guys had limos?

401
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,662
You know what?
It's not that stuff I miss.

402
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,631
It's something else.
It's... it's something

403
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,168
I miss so bad it hurts.

404
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,466
I just miss the love, you know?
I miss...

405
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,201
My mom loved me
when I was a star,

406
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,301
and people loved me
when I was a star.

407
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,178
And when somebody loves you,
it gives you a center.

408
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,115
It makes you feel good inside.

409
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,552
That's what being a star
did for me.

410
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,213
But you know what?

411
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,848
It's all going to happen.

412
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,517
I got my fingers crossed.

413
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,357
I got my hopes up
for this Rob Reiner thing.

414
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,896
Anyway... back to work.

415
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,158
Two pair, Williams.

416
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,324
Read it and weep.

417
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,492
Uh-uh-uh!

418
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,035
What are you, nucking futs?

419
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,501
Four of a kind.

420
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,504
You lose.

421
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,904
Oh, man.

422
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,908
And, Dickie,

423
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,945
they don't give out giant Rob
Reiner parts to guys like us.

424
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,037
And I'll bet you
a thousand dollars--

425
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,582
I'll make it a hundred dollars--

426
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,550
and the actual football we used
to hit Marcia in the face with

427
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,486
in that "Oh, My Nose, My Nose"
episode,

428
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,250
Brendan Frazier never calls.

429
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,650
Hold, please.

430
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,057
No freakin' way.

431
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,255
Go for Dickie.

432
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,525
"Go for Dickie."

433
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,191
Brendan.

434
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,061
Of course I can meet Rob
Reiner tomorrow at noon.

435
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,003
You're the coolest.
You came through.

436
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,506
Thank you.

437
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,974
Oh, my God! He did it!

438
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,643
Sidney, this is the big one.

439
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,774
I'm telling you, I can feel it.

440
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,647
Thanks for letting me
use your car.

441
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,051
You go, son. Go.
You hang on to that energy.

442
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,282
Oh, I will. I'm going
to nail this bastard.

443
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,790
All right, now, remember:.

444
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,450
You believe, you'll receive.

445
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,222
You doubt, you'll go without.

446
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,957
Oh, here's my song.
I got to go.

447
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,798
It is the night

448
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,631
My body's weak

449
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,729
I'm on the run,
no time to sleep

450
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,933
Word to your mother.

451
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,269
I'm going to ride

452
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,139
Ride like the wind

453
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,076
To be a star again

454
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,080
Changing the words,
not the vibe.

455
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,117
Whoo-hoo! This part is mine!

456
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,516
Boom.

457
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,722
Hold the door!

458
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,726
Okay.

459
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,989
Hold it.

460
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,428
I've got it.

461
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,056
Ooh!

462
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,430
Oh.

463
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,994
Hello?

464
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,767
Of course.

465
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,775
Listen, sorry about that.

466
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,174
It's just I couldn't
be late to see Rob.

467
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,906
Yikes! I mean, not yikes.

468
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,446
I mean, what bump?

469
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,415
Hey, are these

470
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,452
Mr. Blake's Backyard?
Can I have one?

471
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,419
Everybody in town
is dying to read it,

472
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,150
but this script is on a
complete and total lockdown.

473
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,749
However...

474
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,020
I'll sneak you a copy

475
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,585
'cause I recognize
you from that TV show.

476
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,187
-Ooh, you will?
-Sure.

477
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,529
Although you'll have to wait

478
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,263
until hell freezes over,
asshole!

479
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,831
Yes?

480
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah.

481
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,372
Mr. Reiner will see you now.

482
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,607
Okay.

483
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,343
Dickie Roberts!

484
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,282
This is nucking futs!

485
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,285
Say it.

486
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,878
This is nucking futs!

487
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:17,819
Hilarious.

488
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,118
Now say it in Spanish.

489
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,886
Aw, I'm kidding ya.

490
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,891
So Nicholson says
to Tom Cruise--

491
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,020
you know, in that...
that Jack voice of his--

492
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,693
"That Demi Moore
is a really good actress.

493
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,396
"We should re-title the movie

494
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:37,340
A Few Good Men and One Damn,
Hot Chick with Huge Boobs. "

495
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,373
Didn't I see you

496
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,710
parking cars
at Morton's Restaurant?

497
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,448
Me?

498
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,316
Yes, you did.

499
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,357
I'm researching
a role for a movie,

500
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,884
and that movie
is called Valet Parkers.

501
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,691
But you know what?

502
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,858
If I got your movie, I'd turn
that thing down. Who cares?

503
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,402
So this part...

504
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:10,067
I mean, you are exactly
the height that I imagined.

505
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:15,045
You have the right build,
the right hair,

506
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,705
the right basic look.

507
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,044
Know this:

508
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,779
I will do any form
of drastic cosmetic surgery

509
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:25,152
to change my appearance
to help the look.

510
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,318
But-- and this
is a very big but--

511
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,623
this is a huge acting part.

512
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,359
I mean, the entire movie
hinges on this performance.

513
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,800
And, Dickie, I just don't think
you could handle it.

514
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,804
I mean, because, well...

515
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,863
because you're
not a real person.

516
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,477
Not real?

517
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,842
I don't mean to insult you.

518
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,347
It's just that, you know,
when an actor researches a part,

519
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,848
it takes weeks,
sometimes months,

520
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,282
to get inside of a character.

521
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,910
For you
to research this part,

522
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,751
you'd have to find out
what it's like to be normal.

523
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:58,983
Because basically,
that's this guy.

524
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,922
He's just a simple, normal guy.

525
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,617
I could do that.
That's easy.

526
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,184
But you don't even know
what normal is.

527
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,787
You completely missed out

528
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,162
on the basic foundation
of adulthood--

529
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,360
which is a childhood.

530
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,800
Who cares about all that stuff?

531
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,928
Look, I'm good.

532
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,767
Throw me
a little somethin'-somethin'

533
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,809
from this supposed childhood
I missed, I'll act it out, man.

534
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,173
Check it out.

535
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,474
A-All right. Uh...

536
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,310
Let's say you're...
you're six.

537
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,113
Uh, let me see
the look on your face

538
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,313
on Christmas morning
when you creep down the stairs

539
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,880
and you see that red bike
under the tree.

540
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,688
You probably never
even had that experience.

541
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:39,322
Gotcha, six, bike, tree, stairs.

542
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,025
Fake stairs.

543
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,803
Holy shit! A bike!

544
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,339
You're six.

545
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,965
Holy crap! A bike!

546
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,133
You're six.

547
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,234
Ga-ga, goo-goo bikey.

548
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,438
Too far back.

549
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,504
Dickie, you're a mess.

550
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,173
I mean, l-I don't know
what you'd have to do

551
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,342
to straighten out.

552
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,910
You'd probably have to relive
your entire childhood.

553
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,420
Wait.

554
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,922
I'm not actually
casting this part

555
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,219
for another couple of months,

556
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,782
but barring
some kind of a miracle,

557
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,792
Yeah.

558
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,692
I just don't think
this is right for you.

559
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:12,923
But you just said...

560
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,623
Said what?

561
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,928
If I relive my childhood.

562
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,059
I can do that.

563
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,569
Dickie,
you're going to hire a family?

564
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,606
That's why I'm selling my book--
I need money.

565
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,605
We're happy about that.

566
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,606
This is amazing stuff.

567
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,699
What a life you've led.

568
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:25,868
The only thing I ask

569
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,640
is that you minimize the
sexy, sensational stuff

570
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,114
because it might hurt my career
with people like Rob Reiner.

571
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,084
Here on, uh, page 47,
it says you had a whistle

572
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,278
stuck up your ass.

573
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,446
Yeah, stuff like that.

574
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,250
I think we should... cut it.

575
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,449
Yeah, but it's a whole chapter.

576
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,821
-It's fantastic.
-And, also,

577
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:41,916
I had a lightbulb up there, too.

578
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,723
-A lightbulb?
-Well, partially.

579
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,629
It was sticking out a little bit
and when I bent over,

580
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,667
it looked like my ass
had a good idea.

581
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,828
Dickie, this whole thing
just sounds bizarre.

582
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,302
No, you know what, I need this.

583
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,704
You know I want a big comeback
and this is the one.

584
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,639
Please help me on this, Sidney.
Come on.

585
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,075
Of course,
our standard advance

586
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,909
for something like this
is $30,000.

587
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,074
Did you say $30,000?

588
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,913
Holy God Almighty!

589
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,247
Christ on a crutch!

590
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,514
We'll take it!

591
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,362
You have 67 messages.

592
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,903
First message:

593
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,496
I saw your ad
about hiring a family.

594
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,076
You that actor guy
needs a family?

595
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,583
Uh, yeah, but, you know what,

596
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,448
this whole thing's
not going to work,

597
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,646
but thank you.

598
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,653
Get back here!

599
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,814
Dance with the devil!

600
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,914
Leave me alone!

601
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,585
You got the cizash,
we got the family.

602
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,922
Sad Eye Sadie...

603
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,298
...Mad Dog, is it, Giant?

604
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,096
Uh, I'm going to think about it.

605
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,295
Great.

606
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,462
Hey, yo, Dickie.

607
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,766
You nucking futs? Yo.

608
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,431
Call a bitch.

609
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,635
I don't actually have
a family, per se.

610
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,071
Is it hot in here?

611
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,913
I'm just going
to take off my robe.

612
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,246
Oh!

613
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,877
Oh, God.

614
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,286
This one's been teasing me.

615
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,415
Come on, Popeye.

616
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,324
Hello.

617
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,952
Hi.

618
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,792
-Uh, may I help you?
-Yeah. I got a message

619
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:00,797
that you had a family

620
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,834
that was willing to put me up
for a month?

621
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,098
Uh, sorry,
there must be some mistake.

622
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,365
No, uh, 741 Mockingbird.

623
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,906
Is this the Finney residence?

624
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,166
Yes, it is,

625
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,971
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

626
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,212
-Hey, George.
-Hey, Andy.

627
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,478
Dickie Roberts.

628
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,452
"This is nucking futs!"

629
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,852
It is.

630
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,219
George Finney-- big fan.

631
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,520
I just loved your show.

632
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,923
Oh, my goodness.

633
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,722
I thought you looked familiar.

634
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,730
But, George, did you...?

635
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,265
Oh, Grace, I should explain.

636
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,028
Dickie and I talked
on the phone

637
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,729
about a mutually advantageous

638
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,202
business venture.
Why don't we, uh,

639
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,035
go inside;
I'll explain everything.

640
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,597
All right, that sounds great.

641
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,806
-Hey.
-This is the casa.

642
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,177
-Whoo!
-Kids?

643
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,476
Kids?

644
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,949
Hey, kids, come here
for a second.

645
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,746
I want you to meet somebody.

646
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,877
George, can I talk to you
for a minute?

647
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:56,943
Just a second, Grace.

648
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,422
Dickie, this is Sam and Sally.

649
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,617
Sam's the boy,

650
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,058
so, that must make her Sally.

651
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,098
Okay, why don't you guys
make small talk,

652
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,361
and Grace and l
will pop into the other room

653
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,902
and hammer out some details.

654
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,837
Hi.

655
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,205
How are you?

656
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,870
We're fine.

657
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,847
How are you?

658
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,042
You don't think you should have
run all this by me first?!

659
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,278
George, you invited a stranger
to live in our home.

660
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,615
It's only for a month or so.

661
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,677
-Well...
-Look,

662
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,689
you just finished
night school, right?

663
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,452
Studied your
interior design thing.

664
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,584
That cost money.

665
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,922
Money we don't have.

666
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,121
That is one of the reasons
I took those classes--

667
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,528
so I can contribute an income.

668
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,360
When?

669
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,367
George...

670
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,562
All I'm saying is we could

671
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,502
really use this extra
money right now.

672
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,563
Pay for some TV ads
down at the car lot.

673
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,939
Take some of the pressure
off of me.

674
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:55,604
I'm asking you this as a favor.

675
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,942
Help me out with this.

676
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,040
I think it'll be a good thing.

677
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,815
I'm going to need a bed.

678
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,913
Should it be a crib?

679
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:08,681
Here's a $20.

680
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,818
I like the idea.

681
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,418
Let's just bring it back
a touch, okay?

682
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,793
Seriously,
how about a water bed?

683
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,229
A water bed?

684
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,994
Yeah, I got
a little lower back noise.

685
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,125
My neck's crunching up.

686
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,227
I think I'll move in tomorrow,
bright and early.

687
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,362
Sounds great, huh?

688
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,168
Operation Re-do Childhood
is about to begin.

689
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,175
I don't want him in our room.

690
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,303
Kids, we really want this thing
with Mr. Roberts to work out,

691
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,314
so, let's try and be
as accommodating as possible.

692
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,314
Okay?

693
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,915
I like that;
I like where you're headed.

694
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,315
That's the right attitude.

695
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,117
All right.

696
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,425
Dickie, I'm telling you,
I've called Reiner's office

697
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,551
over and over.

698
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:43,855
They won't put me through.

699
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,692
I must have left five to six
to seven or eight messages.

700
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,357
Well, then, leave
nine, ten or eleven.

701
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,264
Come on, by the end
of all this, Sidney,

702
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,734
you've got to get
me that audition.

703
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,930
Dickie, I bet you wish
you had a better agent.

704
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,233
No, you're my agent, man.

705
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,568
Come on, we're a team.

706
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,108
Hey, by the way,
I read that script,

707
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,507
Mr. Blake's Backyard
last night.

708
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,601
Oh, yeah?

709
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,408
I couldn't make head
or tails of it.

710
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,311
It's got so much adult stuff,
blah, blah, blah--

711
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,610
I didn't know what was going on.

712
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,117
Maybe I do need
to learn something.

713
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,277
Well, Hutch is your dad.

714
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,786
You've got more talent
in your veins

715
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,253
than half the actors
in this town.

716
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,256
You'll be great.

717
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,851
Sidney, David Soul
is not my father.

718
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,726
Oh, kid, I'm sorry.

719
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,425
Is it Starsky?

720
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,831
No. It's neither.

721
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:29,397
I don't really remember
my real dad.

722
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,169
The only memory I have

723
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,075
is playing
that board game Candy Land.

724
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,375
I was about five or six.

725
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,608
We were laughing.

726
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,047
I was really happy.

727
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,277
But then he left,

728
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,343
and it was just me and my mom
for a while,

729
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,412
and then she left, so...

730
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,355
I'm sorry, kid.

731
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:51,293
Sidney, the point is,
you've always been there for me.

732
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,023
You've been a good guy.

733
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,895
You're a good agent;
I appreciate it.

734
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,661
All right, listen,
you go do your project,

735
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,866
and I promise you,
I'll do whatever it takes

736
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,101
to get you that audition

737
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,506
with Rob Reiner, okay?

738
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,568
I never doubted you
for a second.

739
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,442
We're a team.

740
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,880
We're going to get this.

741
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,813
Go get 'em!

742
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,065
And another thing,
Stranger Danger,

743
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,902
all these video games--
they're mine.

744
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,905
And, uh, Sally's stuff--
that's hers.

745
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,102
So, no touchy.

746
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,337
Hey, can you knock it off

747
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,901
with the Stranger Danger
moniker?

748
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,104
I'm not nuts about it.

749
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,672
Well, I think this water bed
thing is a little silly.

750
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,377
Are you, like,
cuckoo in the head?

751
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,682
Yeah, and I don't think
you should turn on that hose.

752
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,381
You'll get
a Water Wiggle action going.

753
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,923
Ooh, Water Wiggle-- what's that?

754
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,217
The toy-- Water Wiggle?

755
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,317
You don't know what toy that is?

756
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,588
Uh-uh.

757
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:58,788
Oh, man, this is sad.

758
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,832
You really did miss out,
didn't you, Stranger Danger?

759
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,924
Well, I can teach you

760
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,796
how to put Preparation H
on your eyes

761
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,927
to get rid of bags, huh?

762
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,503
I'll help you, you help me.

763
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,732
I'm just saying

764
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,934
a Water Wiggle
will beat the crap out of you.

765
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,669
Yeah, it's less of a toy
and more of a bruise machine.

766
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,610
I like that, that's interesting,
tell me more.

767
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,942
What other toys should I know?

768
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,280
Uh, Gobots, Hot Wheels, Robodon.

769
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,283
Transformers.

770
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,284
Slip 'n Slide.

771
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,285
Stratego.

772
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,286
Mousetrap.

773
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,287
-Trolls.
-Hurry Up.

774
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,288
-He-man.
-Slinky.

775
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,289
-Dumarina.
-Click Clacks.

776
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,290
-Pac-Man.
-Clue.

777
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,826
-Wheel-o.
-Donkey Kong.

778
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,418
-Caterpillar.
-Duncan Yo-Yo.

779
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,361
-Razor Scooters.
-Return to Wolfenstein.

780
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,059
Uh-uh-uh.
Okay, that's enough.

781
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,624
Don't make me call
the Guinness Book.

782
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,602
But what about
the best game of all?

783
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,969
Come on, guys.

784
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,130
Candy Land?

785
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,971
-No.
-Don't know it.

786
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,543
No? I got you.

787
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,272
Whoo! In your face. Candy Land.

788
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,109
That was the most fun
I had as a kid.

789
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,479
I remember I picked the card
with the ice-cream bar on it.

790
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,108
I was like...

791
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,516
We have a winner! Whoo!

792
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,554
Yeah, whatever.

793
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,747
But still, it's Water Wiggle

794
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,187
that you should
be thinking about.

795
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,487
Steady, Chicken Little.

796
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,326
Oh.

797
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:15,568
Oh, my God.

798
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,308
What's up? You like that?!

799
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:31,479
Yeah! What happened, bitch? Huh?

800
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,886
Damn, that Water Wiggle thing
is like a Stephen King movie.

801
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,554
It's supposed to be a toy?

802
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,327
Anyway, okay, so, this
is a Water Wiggle.

803
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,095
Any other toys
you want to show me?

804
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,200
Oh, my gosh.

805
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,711
Look at all this shizzit.

806
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,770
What's shizzit?

807
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,076
It's a secret way to swear.

808
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,083
Again, learn from me,
I'll learn from you.

809
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:04,053
These were all our toys
from when we were kids.

810
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,089
Yeah.

811
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,556
Seems like only yesterday.

812
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,220
Wow, we sure did have
a lot of shizzit.

813
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,460
Farm-a-long.

814
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,399
The rooster crows
his morning crow.

815
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,696
And the horse whinnies

816
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,294
-for its rider.
-Boring.

817
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,339
Let me guess--
the cow says "moo"

818
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,874
and the duck says "quack."

819
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,933
You need to update this thing.

820
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,704
How about
"The sprinkler says..."

821
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,844
Yeah. And a motorcycle goes...

822
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:41,484
And the jet ski-- similar
to the motorcycle, not the same.

823
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,461
See, it bogs out a little bit

824
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,297
'cause you got water
in the carb. Hmm?

825
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,603
Sally's looking at me like,
"You're an idiot."

826
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,699
Well, get in line, sister,
because my ex-girlfriend says,

827
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,834
"You're a loser,"

828
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,038
and the casting director says,
"You're washed up,"

829
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,910
and my mom says,
"You're an embarrassment,"

830
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,073
and the guy in the street says,
"You suck,"

831
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,778
and I said, "No, you suck,"
and he says, "You suck, dude,"

832
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,081
and I go, "No, you suck,"

833
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,213
and he goes,
"You know you suck," and I go...

834
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,827
The rooster crows.
The rooster crows.

835
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,262
What else you got?

836
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,926
Could you pass the potatoes,
please?

837
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,562
Popeye, no.

838
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,333
Go.

839
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,637
Oh, hey, Mom, where's
my field hockey jersey?

840
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,142
I couldn't find it.

841
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,908
Hmm. I washed it and folded it
and put it in your drawer.

842
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,040
No wonder you couldn't find it.

843
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,414
Hey, Stranger Danger,
I got to ask,

844
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,577
what's with the gloves?

845
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,119
It's kind of freaking me out.

846
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,348
Uh, sanitary reasons. Shh.

847
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,118
Anyway, you guys,

848
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,385
I don't want to stop you--
keep going.

849
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,448
Talk, talk, talk.

850
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,687
I love all this normal crap.

851
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:51,820
"Crap?"

852
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,160
Stuff. Normal stuff.

853
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,563
Hey, where's George?

854
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,260
I want a little Dad action.

855
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,496
He's hardly ever at dinner.

856
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,266
Sally, Jane called.

857
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,773
She wants you to call her back.

858
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,775
Who's this Jason boy
she's got a crush on?

859
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,777
Oh, just some boy,
but Heather Bolan

860
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,904
is totally stealing him
away from her.

861
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,471
Why?

862
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,516
Because she can.

863
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,244
She's the most beautiful girl
in the school,

864
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,546
and whatever she wants,
she gets.

865
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,747
Heather Bolan
has an older brother.

866
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,153
He's a real jerk.

867
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,123
He totally picks on Sam.

868
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,820
It seems like everybody
at school does.

869
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,657
There's my phone.
Shh. Two seconds.

870
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,698
Go for Dickie.

871
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,789
Hey, Dickie.

872
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:29,833
Hey, Sidney.

873
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,699
I just got back
from Rob Reiner's office.

874
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,169
Guess who was there?

875
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,296
Sean Penn.

876
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,931
No, not Sean Penn!

877
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,135
Not Sean Penn! Damn!

878
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,803
Oh, Dickie,
don't worry about it.

879
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,541
I struck up a friendship
with Rob's security people.

880
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,082
I really feel
we're moving forward.

881
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,175
Yes! And this studying-up-
on-being-a-kid thing

882
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,276
is going great.

883
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,877
Get me in there,

884
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,855
I'll nail that part
like Jesus the Carpenter.

885
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,325
All right,
I'll see you later, buddy.

886
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:57,725
Heh-heh! Whoo!

887
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,353
Oh, sorry.

888
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,897
I get a little excited.

889
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,863
I'm gonna go drain the main
vein, how about that?

890
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:08,097
I mean, I go pee pee now.

891
00:35:19,153 --> 00:35:20,313
It's so crazy.

892
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:21,786
The Water Wiggle thing
was a joke.

893
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:23,881
He destroyed this toy
that pissed him off.

894
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,789
It's like he was
totally out of control.

895
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,350
Mom, you've got to listen to me.

896
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:28,986
We don't want him
around anymore.

897
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:30,360
Can't you make him go away?

898
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:31,420
I'd like to,

899
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:33,330
but your father made
this deal with him.

900
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,731
Wait, I got it.

901
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:36,895
Let's pretend that staying
in our tree house out back

902
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,768
is good for his project.

903
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah. But, Sam, the tree house
is pretty old and crappy.

904
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:42,200
So is he.

905
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:44,767
We want him out of our house,
don't we?

906
00:35:44,845 --> 00:35:46,335
Don't we?

907
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:49,138
Hey.

908
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:50,274
You know what, Dickie?

909
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:51,784
We came up with a great idea.

910
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:54,286
Maybe you should stay
out back in the tree house.

911
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:55,720
Sam, that's a great idea.

912
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,984
A real kid would do that,
wouldn't he?

913
00:35:58,058 --> 00:35:59,355
Yeah. Yeah, that might be fun.

914
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:00,757
All right.

915
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,479
I wonder what
he's doing up there.

916
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:27,282
Who cares, just so Stranger
Danger's out of our house.

917
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,584
But still.

918
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:31,557
Yeah.

919
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,354
It actually looks pretty cool.

920
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:35,691
Is that a disco ball?

921
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:36,821
Woo!

922
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:40,355
See, maybe we should
peek our heads in.

923
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:44,201
Okay, let me do the talking.

924
00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:50,871
Uh, may I help you?

925
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:54,278
Was I being too loud
in my tree house?

926
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:55,280
Um...

927
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:56,976
Well, we just wanted to know

928
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:58,245
if we could come up.

929
00:36:58,319 --> 00:36:59,286
"Can we come up?"

930
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:00,547
All right, you can come up

931
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,589
for a little bit,
see what you're missing.

932
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,894
Well, you really fixed
this place up, didn't you?

933
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:12,955
Oh, yeah, I did.

934
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,227
Put a little lipstick
on this pig.

935
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,827
But I'm confused,
'cause you like it now,

936
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:20,965
and I thought the tree
house was a drag.

937
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:24,909
If I took a poll,
people would say it sucked.

938
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,241
But maybe I'm wrong.

939
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,543
Maybe I'm stupid,
maybe I'm a dumb-dumb.

940
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:30,743
It is kind of cool now.

941
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:32,752
Oh, it's cool now.

942
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,787
You hear that?

943
00:37:33,854 --> 00:37:35,116
It's kind of cool now.

944
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:36,986
Let's go.

945
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:38,353
Wait.

946
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,393
Don't leave.
You guys can stay.

947
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:43,453
What do you want to do?

948
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,700
And so the hook hand

949
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:50,100
was hanging there
on the car door.

950
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,937
Ooh, that was intense.

951
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:56,704
Okay, now it's my turn.

952
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,972
All right.

953
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:05,307
This is the story of the witch
of Cloverfield Central School.

954
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:11,817
Once upon a time,
there was this witch in school.

955
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:16,829
She was a very, very bad witch.

956
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:19,263
Ha, ha.

957
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,062
All the boys liked her,

958
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:24,764
because they didn't know
what a bad witch she was.

959
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:28,205
Sally,
does this witch have a name?

960
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:30,766
Mm...
No, not really.

961
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:32,436
Just a witch.

962
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:36,449
Right, and Sally,
what does this witch look like?

963
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,712
Okay, she dresses very nice,

964
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:41,254
'cause her dad
has a lot of money.

965
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:45,224
Really hot capris,
super tight Zootopia tops.

966
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:46,953
I don't think this is a witch.

967
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:49,655
I think it's Heather Bolan.

968
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,960
What? That's crazy.

969
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:53,966
Okay, it's Heather Bolan.

970
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:56,867
Oh, you know what, Sally?

971
00:38:56,937 --> 00:38:59,405
I don't like her
and I've never even met her.

972
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:01,873
Anyone who bugs you
can't be good.

973
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:03,876
Now it's my turn.

974
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:09,211
My story is called "The Day
the Sitcom Got Canceled."

975
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:16,612
The sky, she was stormy
that night.

976
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,954
Suddenly, the phone rang.

977
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,603
The little boy's mother
picked it up.

978
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:32,263
"Hello?"

979
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:35,706
The evil producer on
the other end said,

980
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:37,676
"The ratings have hit
a six-year low."

981
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:41,607
It gets scarier.

982
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:43,707
"The network is in a panic."

983
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,178
Yeah.
Here's where it heats up.

984
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:49,722
They didn't
have a replacement show.

985
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,654
No, no!

986
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,089
Dickie!

987
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,719
I know,
what are they going to do?

988
00:39:56,463 --> 00:39:58,260
What? What's wrong?

989
00:39:58,332 --> 00:39:59,128
There's something...

990
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,167
Okay, I'll stop. What?

991
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,345
No.

992
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:19,682
Don't, don't.

993
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:21,015
Get away.

994
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:23,022
No, get off.

995
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,251
He's having a nightmare.

996
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:27,589
He's been talking in his sleep
like that for the last hour.

997
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,222
Dickie?

998
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:32,026
He's getting... Get off.

999
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,465
-Don't leave me.
-Dickie, wake up.

1000
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:36,730
No. It's on me.

1001
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,328
I can't...

1002
00:40:38,405 --> 00:40:39,531
Mom?

1003
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,164
What?

1004
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:42,503
Do something.

1005
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,373
No, not again.

1006
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:51,440
Dickie, wake up.
Dickie, wake up.

1007
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:53,213
Wake up.

1008
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,380
You were having a bad dream.

1009
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:57,390
Oh, there were these big spiders

1010
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:59,892
and they...
they were trying to eat me

1011
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,326
and they jammed their legs
down my ear

1012
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:04,125
and in my brain,
and they were...

1013
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,256
Mom.

1014
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:06,959
...guts of my head and...

1015
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:07,932
Come on, Mom, sing it.

1016
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:09,332
And there was so many...

1017
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,893
Okay. Dickie,

1018
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,370
this is what I do for my kids

1019
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,997
when they're having a nightmare.

1020
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:18,203
Hush little baby,
don't say a word

1021
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:21,907
Mama's gonna buy you
a mockingbird

1022
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:25,145
And if that mockingbird
don't sing

1023
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:29,986
Mama's going to buy you
a diamond ring

1024
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:34,721
If that diamond ring
turns brass...

1025
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,192
Okay.

1026
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,238
Let's go to bed.
It's okay.

1027
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,952
Now, that was probably
the nicest thing

1028
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,649
anyone's ever done for me.

1029
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:06,590
You feel bad, and your mom

1030
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,189
actually tries
to make you feel not bad.

1031
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,163
Wow.

1032
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:19,705
By the way,
your mom's really hot.

1033
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:21,001
-What?
-Ew!

1034
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:23,474
What, am I wrong?

1035
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:24,841
And what's the backyard like?

1036
00:42:24,912 --> 00:42:26,345
Has she got the G-string going

1037
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,938
or them big ol' grannies
with the louvers?

1038
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:30,506
I'm betting sweet thong.

1039
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:31,414
-Ugh!
-Gross!

1040
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:32,509
Yuck.

1041
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:34,850
Come on, Sam,
pretend she's not your mom.

1042
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:36,014
Are they real?

1043
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:37,351
I think they're real.

1044
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,914
I bumped into them the other day

1045
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:41,256
and it was like "boing,"
and I was like "boing."

1046
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:43,023
Dickie, she's our mom.

1047
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:46,657
She's my mom, too,
and I'm dealing with it somehow.

1048
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,792
Anyway.

1049
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,530
Good night, prude people.

1050
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:53,198
Dream the dream of prudes.

1051
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:55,207
Prude it up.

1052
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:58,210
Have a nice G-rated dream
full of prudiness.

1053
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:00,269
Go to sleep, Dickie.

1054
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:06,978
Okay, Stranger Danger,
this is a Slip 'n Slide.

1055
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:08,919
If you master this,

1056
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,219
it's the first step
to being a real kid.

1057
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,690
-Great.
-Dickie,

1058
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:13,851
there has to be water on it.

1059
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,422
Oh, that's...

1060
00:43:16,496 --> 00:43:18,123
that's going to leave a mark.

1061
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,868
That... stings.

1062
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:27,540
Good to go.

1063
00:43:32,245 --> 00:43:33,644
-Yeah, all right.
-He did it.

1064
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:34,646
That was great.

1065
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:35,909
I got something better.

1066
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:38,110
Just water is lame.

1067
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,517
This thing needs
a little Wesson-ality.

1068
00:43:40,587 --> 00:43:42,020
Dickie, are you sure about this?

1069
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,716
Steady.

1070
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,420
Here we go.

1071
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,664
Oh, shizzit!

1072
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:00,801
Ow...!

1073
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,839
Splinter.

1074
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:07,641
That toy is
lnsane in the membrane

1075
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:08,976
Insane, got no brain.

1076
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:13,317
I got pretty banged up out
there, but I learned some stuff.

1077
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:15,514
Let's keep it mellow
in the future.

1078
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:17,750
So, what do you drink,
being a kid?

1079
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:19,655
Uh, soda, like-like root beer.

1080
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:20,818
Well, not a wussy kid.

1081
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:21,986
A real kid, all right?

1082
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:24,154
You had me at the beer part,
but you lost me at root.

1083
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:25,698
Now, let's not jump
to malt liquor,

1084
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:26,960
but something in the middle.

1085
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:28,501
How about real beer?

1086
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:30,593
Whoa, lady. Easy.

1087
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:31,603
Whoa.

1088
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:32,764
Okay, real beer. How many?

1089
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:33,806
Six-pack?

1090
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:35,000
So, you're crazy?

1091
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:36,007
A six-pack?

1092
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:37,304
Are you a total alkie?

1093
00:44:37,377 --> 00:44:38,173
Oh, my gosh.

1094
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:39,177
How about four?

1095
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:40,338
One for you, one for you,

1096
00:44:40,414 --> 00:44:42,848
and two for me
'cause I'm kind of a husky kid.

1097
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,508
Okay, so a six-pack.

1098
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:45,846
You just said four.

1099
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:48,012
Oh, the wussy's taking
the minutes of the meeting.

1100
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:49,180
Okay, four it is.

1101
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:50,655
I'll buy. I'll fly.

1102
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:54,592
We have beer.

1103
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:56,526
We're not supposed
to drink that.

1104
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:57,688
What?

1105
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:59,527
We're supposed to think
about drinking beer

1106
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,328
one day, in the future.

1107
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:03,767
It's like, uh, you know,
"When I get older,

1108
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:05,828
I'm going to be allowed
to drink beer."

1109
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:07,237
It's going too fast.

1110
00:45:07,307 --> 00:45:08,968
I knew kids
that were on TV shows

1111
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,839
getting whiffed up
when they're 16.

1112
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,435
"Whiffed up"?

1113
00:45:12,512 --> 00:45:14,480
Whiff, coke, toot,
lines, blast, rails,

1114
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:16,072
nose candy, devil's dandruff,

1115
00:45:16,149 --> 00:45:17,639
power flour, sniffy jiffy,

1116
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:18,810
booger sugar.

1117
00:45:18,885 --> 00:45:21,718
Come on, Sam, the rest
of the class is on page 52.

1118
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:24,313
Dickie, when you're talking
to me, all I'm thinking is

1119
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,824
Brick wall, waterfall

1120
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:27,689
Dickie thinks he got it all,
but he don't

1121
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:30,229
And I do, so boom
with that attitude

1122
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:31,491
Peace, punch, Cap'n Crunch

1123
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:32,998
I got something you can't touch

1124
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:34,328
Bang, bang, choo-choo train

1125
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,698
Wind me up, I do my thing

1126
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:37,259
No Reese's Pieces, 7 UP

1127
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:39,202
Mess with me, I'll mess you up.

1128
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:41,172
Interesting.

1129
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,538
Whatever.

1130
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:44,236
Anyway.

1131
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:46,404
By the way, sniffy jiffy,
it's no good.

1132
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,310
Don't do it.

1133
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,312
Let me tell you something.

1134
00:45:48,381 --> 00:45:49,678
About this putting stuff off?

1135
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,344
When I was your age,
I did whatever I wanted,

1136
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,216
whenever I wanted.

1137
00:45:54,287 --> 00:45:57,017
Okay, see, that might be
why you're such a mess now.

1138
00:45:57,124 --> 00:46:00,116
Oh! How dare you.

1139
00:46:00,193 --> 00:46:01,956
Anyway, check this out.

1140
00:46:02,028 --> 00:46:03,290
Look, I went ahead

1141
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:05,957
and got you
your precious root beer.

1142
00:46:06,032 --> 00:46:08,694
Ooh, I love it.

1143
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:20,546
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

1144
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:28,914
"l am lron Man."

1145
00:46:31,057 --> 00:46:33,719
I want to bang your mother.

1146
00:46:35,562 --> 00:46:37,530
I said I want...

1147
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,594
Oh...

1148
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:45,263
By the way, thanks, you guys.

1149
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:47,738
For what?

1150
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:49,002
Being nice to me.

1151
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:51,908
Knocking off
the Stranger Danger thing.

1152
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:54,913
Well, Dickie, you're
actually a pretty cool guy.

1153
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:58,007
I mean,
very deep down inside you.

1154
00:46:58,118 --> 00:46:59,983
I mean, really deep.

1155
00:47:00,053 --> 00:47:02,453
So deep that some people
stop looking.

1156
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:03,784
Deeper than a well.

1157
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:05,051
Deeper than the ocean.

1158
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,956
Deeper than the Marianas Trench.

1159
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:08,289
Deeper than a volcano.

1160
00:47:08,361 --> 00:47:09,589
Deeper than a...

1161
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:12,632
All right, I got it--
it's deep.

1162
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,963
Now, shh.

1163
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:17,299
Sleepy time.

1164
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:21,033
Little prude sleep.

1165
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:25,634
Insane in the membrane

1166
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:28,272
Insane, got no brain.

1167
00:47:39,226 --> 00:47:41,160
What time did you get in
last night?

1168
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:43,992
Would you get off my back?

1169
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:46,328
I was out with a
salesman all night.

1170
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:47,593
They like to drink.

1171
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,328
Morning.

1172
00:47:50,403 --> 00:47:51,665
Mommy, Daddy, bro, sis.

1173
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:52,727
Good morning.

1174
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:53,830
Morning, Dickie.

1175
00:47:53,907 --> 00:47:55,169
Hey, Pebbles, where's Bamm-Bamm?

1176
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:57,836
Oh! Interesting.

1177
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:00,641
Got a little champagne
brunch for my new family.

1178
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,705
How about that?
Mimosa for me posse?

1179
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:05,544
Champagne for my real friends,

1180
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,177
and I'm a real pain
to my sham friends.

1181
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:10,280
Dickie, I'd like you to stop by
the dealership today.

1182
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:11,449
Oh, a little father-son thing?

1183
00:48:11,524 --> 00:48:12,616
What do I say to that, Sam?

1184
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:13,659
Give it a yea?

1185
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:14,751
I wouldn't know.

1186
00:48:14,828 --> 00:48:16,352
He never asked me
to go to work with him.

1187
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,590
All right, mark you
down as no help.

1188
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:20,155
Sally, over to you? Yea?

1189
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,963
Yeah, a "yay" will cover it.

1190
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:24,627
Yay!

1191
00:48:24,704 --> 00:48:26,968
So head up there
around, what, 12:00-ish?

1192
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,132
All right. Heh-heh.

1193
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:29,800
Hey, and you-- push
me in a stroller.

1194
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:31,434
I want to get a feel
for that thing.

1195
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:33,274
What?

1196
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:34,210
Ah-dah-dah.

1197
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:35,213
Daddy!

1198
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:36,544
Mommy's balking.

1199
00:48:36,616 --> 00:48:38,481
She doesn't understand--

1200
00:48:38,551 --> 00:48:41,213
I'm up against the likes
of Mr. Sean Penn here.

1201
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:43,222
Grace, let's try
and make this work.

1202
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,985
Yes, let's try to make it work.

1203
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:46,992
Thanks, Daddy.
Whoo!

1204
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:49,618
Whoo, whoopie!

1205
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:51,960
This feels a little odd.

1206
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:53,829
Dude, I'm the one
in the stroller.

1207
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,424
Did you just call me "dude"?

1208
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:57,595
I mean, "Mommy!"

1209
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:59,832
It's hard to get my head
around that word.

1210
00:48:59,906 --> 00:49:01,271
You know, my actual mother

1211
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:03,434
wanted me to call her
by her first name.

1212
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,205
And you're, like,
way too beautiful

1213
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:06,370
to be a mom.

1214
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,107
I mean, you obviously are
a mother, so...

1215
00:49:08,181 --> 00:49:11,776
I'm wrong, but maybe you're not
as beautiful as I think you are.

1216
00:49:11,851 --> 00:49:12,943
Wow, let me sift

1217
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:15,283
through that to find
the nugget of compliment.

1218
00:49:15,355 --> 00:49:16,617
Sift away, sifty.

1219
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,351
You realize, don't you,
that this whole idea

1220
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:19,551
is without a doubt

1221
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:22,322
the most ridiculous endeavor
ever attempted.

1222
00:49:22,395 --> 00:49:23,657
Oh, Grace?

1223
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,958
Hi-hi, Mrs. Gertrude.

1224
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:26,896
You know, your tree
is dropping leaves

1225
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,059
on our property again.

1226
00:49:28,134 --> 00:49:29,260
Oh, I'm really sorry.

1227
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:30,394
It's just that l...

1228
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:31,801
It's getting to be a nuisance,

1229
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:33,600
and we're trying
to be good neighbors,

1230
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:34,935
but you're really
making it hard.

1231
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:38,477
Oh, who do we have here?

1232
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:40,308
Aren't you a little
big for a stroller?

1233
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:42,981
Aren't you a little big
for a sidewalk?

1234
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:46,712
I mean, good God,
hide the wicker furniture.

1235
00:49:46,786 --> 00:49:48,583
Whoo! This ass means business.

1236
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,282
Folks, this is not a drill.

1237
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:51,984
China, I'm sorry
about the tremors,

1238
00:49:52,058 --> 00:49:53,491
but this lady needs her mail.

1239
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,492
What, cat got your tongue,

1240
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:55,653
or do you eat that
for breakfast, too?

1241
00:49:57,897 --> 00:50:02,163
And you keep your filthy dog
Popeye out of our yard, too,

1242
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:04,169
you horrid neighbor!

1243
00:50:04,237 --> 00:50:06,330
Ca-coon, ca-coon, ca-coon.

1244
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,003
Dickie, you were
very rude to her.

1245
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:10,633
Well, and she was
straight-up with you?

1246
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,802
Come on, Grace,

1247
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:13,607
you got to learn to
stand up for yourself.

1248
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,580
But to be honest,

1249
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:17,115
I kind of liked standing
up for you just then.

1250
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:18,115
Well, it...

1251
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:21,676
I will say,
in a way, it was nice.

1252
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:23,017
I'm not used to it.

1253
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:25,920
Hey! You're that guy
from the TV show.

1254
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,857
The washed-up actor freak.

1255
00:50:28,928 --> 00:50:29,860
Can I get a picture?

1256
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,191
You know what?

1257
00:50:31,264 --> 00:50:32,993
You put it that way,
you sure can.

1258
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:33,998
Look at this.

1259
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:35,091
Smile.

1260
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,358
Zoom. Nice.

1261
00:50:37,437 --> 00:50:39,268
Ah. There you go, Cap'n.

1262
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:41,204
Memories are forever.

1263
00:50:41,274 --> 00:50:42,866
Hey, make doubles.

1264
00:50:42,942 --> 00:50:44,034
Unbelievable.

1265
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,372
No, look, I'm sorry, all right?

1266
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:47,379
Look, I'm new at this, too.

1267
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:48,539
I need your help.

1268
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:49,639
Well, I'll tell you
this much--

1269
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:51,411
you're going to have
to disguise yourself somehow.

1270
00:50:51,484 --> 00:50:53,042
Wait, wait, wait,
what do you mean?

1271
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:54,050
Like, dye your hair.

1272
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:55,779
Anything, so people
don't recognize you

1273
00:50:55,855 --> 00:50:57,823
and make you forget
you're trying to be a kid.

1274
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,051
That's a great idea.

1275
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:01,990
Oh, not only is she sexy,
she's a smart mommy!

1276
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:05,825
Why did that compliment
almost make me puke?

1277
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:07,696
What'd I say?

1278
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:10,494
That was nice.

1279
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,164
So, this lndian's sitting
by the side of the road.

1280
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,831
He's selling clay pots.

1281
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:16,671
Now a tourist is
looking 'em over.

1282
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,108
He says, "Hey,

1283
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:20,009
"you're selling this pot
for five dollars.

1284
00:51:20,113 --> 00:51:22,604
You got the same exact pot
over there for ten dollars."

1285
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:24,809
And the lndian says,

1286
00:51:24,884 --> 00:51:28,012
"Some people like to spend
five dollars;

1287
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,351
other people like to spend
ten dollars."

1288
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:33,855
Ah, I got a better joke.

1289
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,554
Two gay monkeys
go to lstanbul...

1290
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:36,720
Dickie, it's not a joke,

1291
00:51:36,796 --> 00:51:38,661
it's a philosophy of life:
money.

1292
00:51:38,731 --> 00:51:39,663
Oh...

1293
00:51:39,732 --> 00:51:41,029
Making money-- isn't money

1294
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:43,295
what your little comeback thing
is all about?

1295
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:44,461
Actually, no, it's...

1296
00:51:44,537 --> 00:51:46,835
I'll be honest with you, Dickie.

1297
00:51:46,906 --> 00:51:49,033
I've been married for 14 years
to the same woman,

1298
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:50,303
and we got a couple of kids.

1299
00:51:50,376 --> 00:51:51,468
They seem like nice kids.

1300
00:51:51,544 --> 00:51:53,842
I don't know, I don't spend
a lot of time with them.

1301
00:51:53,913 --> 00:51:56,711
I'm not really much
of a kid person.

1302
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,343
Man, I'm on a treadmill, Dickie.

1303
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:00,408
I look around,

1304
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:03,650
I see everybody else
is having all the fun.

1305
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:06,988
Just when I think
I can't take it anymore,

1306
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,823
you fall into my lap.

1307
00:52:08,895 --> 00:52:10,920
You're my answer, Dickie.

1308
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:13,329
You're the thing
that's gonna make me happy.

1309
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:19,266
I'm not into dudes, if that's
what you're ramping up to.

1310
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:21,671
Like, I don't.
I did. I don't anymore.

1311
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:23,003
All I'm saying is,

1312
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:26,840
you get what you want
out of my family...

1313
00:52:26,913 --> 00:52:29,143
Iet me get something out of you.

1314
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:30,682
Star maps here.

1315
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,684
Maps to the stars' homes.

1316
00:52:32,752 --> 00:52:34,686
God bless you, sir.

1317
00:52:34,754 --> 00:52:36,381
Thanks.

1318
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:40,522
Hey, Rob Reiner's
not on this map.

1319
00:52:40,593 --> 00:52:43,494
God bless you, sir.

1320
00:52:46,766 --> 00:52:47,858
Ah...

1321
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,473
Mm, hey.

1322
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:05,473
Oh, what time is it?

1323
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:07,918
3:20. Oh, I gotta go
meet the kids.

1324
00:53:10,723 --> 00:53:12,486
Look at little Sammy,
the sissy.

1325
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,652
Come on, you guys,
just leave him alone.

1326
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:15,819
Ah!

1327
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:18,728
His wittle sister
has to stand up for him.

1328
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:20,663
What a little wussy Sam is.

1329
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:22,166
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

1330
00:53:22,235 --> 00:53:23,167
What'd I ever do to you?

1331
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:28,229
Sammy, the sissy,
acting all prissy.

1332
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:31,141
Sammy the sissy, acting
all prissy.

1333
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:32,473
Sammy the sissy,
acting all prissy.

1334
00:53:32,545 --> 00:53:33,739
Guys, he's minding
his own business.

1335
00:53:33,813 --> 00:53:34,711
Sammy, the...

1336
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:36,976
-Why don't you?
-Sam, Sally, what's up?

1337
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,915
Dickie, is that you?

1338
00:53:38,985 --> 00:53:40,543
Holy crap on toast!

1339
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,814
Look at this freak!

1340
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:45,187
Figures he'd be
with Sam Finney, huh, Sammy?

1341
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:46,520
Let's get out of here.

1342
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:48,185
Leave him alone, you creeps!

1343
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:49,455
What did you call us,
you little bitch?

1344
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:51,759
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you just
said the wrong thing

1345
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:52,957
to the wrong little girl, Cap'n.

1346
00:53:53,032 --> 00:53:54,499
What does she weigh, 20?

1347
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,330
What do you weigh, 2,000?

1348
00:53:56,402 --> 00:53:58,199
You want to pick on her?
Why not pick on me?

1349
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:00,364
You bastards want to go
toe-to-toe with me?

1350
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,271
I'll go Water Wiggle
on your ass.

1351
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:03,104
Huh?

1352
00:54:03,176 --> 00:54:04,404
"Huh? Wha?

1353
00:54:04,477 --> 00:54:06,638
I don't understand words.
I'm a dumb-dumb."

1354
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:09,443
Is that red hair, or did someone
light a fart off your mouth?

1355
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:10,777
-Hey!
-Hey?

1356
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:11,874
Don't you mean oink?

1357
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:13,748
Little Piggy, shouldn't you
run off to the market?

1358
00:54:14,887 --> 00:54:15,819
Oink, oink.

1359
00:54:15,888 --> 00:54:16,820
That was crazy.

1360
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:19,517
Now the crowd's
turning on you, and that sucks.

1361
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:21,492
Tell you what.
Listen.

1362
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:23,552
Red, tub o' goo,
freak of nature,

1363
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,326
why don't you guys run home,
pee your pants,

1364
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:27,331
cry your eyes out,

1365
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,368
spank each other's
chubby, little butts,

1366
00:54:29,435 --> 00:54:31,130
get up, have an Eggo,

1367
00:54:31,204 --> 00:54:33,001
run back here, and
we'll do it all again?

1368
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:34,539
'Cause I like working out

1369
00:54:34,607 --> 00:54:35,539
on you puke-stained,
little punching bags.

1370
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:36,939
A-choo!

1371
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,534
Now beat it.

1372
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:39,600
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1373
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,476
-Get out of my way!
-Sam Finney's

1374
00:54:41,547 --> 00:54:43,242
way cooler than any of you
will ever be.

1375
00:54:43,316 --> 00:54:44,874
What a joke.

1376
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:47,385
Oh, yeah!

1377
00:54:47,453 --> 00:54:49,683
Mom, you should have seen
Dickie back there.

1378
00:54:49,756 --> 00:54:50,688
It was awesome!

1379
00:54:50,757 --> 00:54:51,883
He totally nailed these kids.

1380
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,687
It was a verbal beating,
a carpet bombing.

1381
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,692
Actually, Dickie,

1382
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:56,422
I can't believe what
you did to your hair.

1383
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:57,428
What? Oh...

1384
00:54:58,498 --> 00:54:59,658
No wonder
everyone was staring at me.

1385
00:54:59,732 --> 00:55:01,063
What a weirdo.

1386
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:03,261
Dickie, it was great
how you tore into those guys.

1387
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:05,236
I'm not impressed
that Dickie insulted

1388
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:06,567
a bunch of your friends.

1389
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:07,765
Well, they're
not really friends.

1390
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,137
Yeah, you should have seen
these guys.

1391
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,698
I mean, I hope
they never come back.

1392
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:11,766
They're losers.

1393
00:55:11,844 --> 00:55:13,368
Just-just, Mom, relax.

1394
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:15,909
Relax?

1395
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:17,244
Wrong attitude with a mom,
buddy.

1396
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:18,409
You got to keep it light,

1397
00:55:18,484 --> 00:55:19,974
-and, you know, deferential.
-Oh!

1398
00:55:20,086 --> 00:55:21,314
Look, you guys, before pizza,

1399
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:22,945
I've got to swing by
this interview.

1400
00:55:23,022 --> 00:55:24,216
It'll just take a few minutes.

1401
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,848
They just want to meet
the voice from the phone.

1402
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:27,688
You got an interview?
For what?

1403
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,886
An interior design job.

1404
00:55:28,961 --> 00:55:31,225
They looked at my drawings,
and they liked them.

1405
00:55:31,297 --> 00:55:32,229
Mom, that's great!

1406
00:55:32,298 --> 00:55:33,230
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

1407
00:55:33,299 --> 00:55:35,096
That is some cool shizzit.

1408
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:36,601
What did you just say?

1409
00:55:36,669 --> 00:55:37,829
Shizzit.

1410
00:55:37,904 --> 00:55:39,132
It's a Dickie word.

1411
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:41,173
Dickie, after my interview,

1412
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,367
you and I are going to have
a serious talk.

1413
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:46,241
Mom, l...
Dickie will be fine.

1414
00:55:46,312 --> 00:55:48,143
Yeah, he may have
a few rough edges,

1415
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:49,909
but we'll file 'em down for him.

1416
00:55:49,982 --> 00:55:52,177
Ah, see, Mommy?
It's all gonna work out.

1417
00:55:52,251 --> 00:55:53,343
Oh, boy.

1418
00:55:53,419 --> 00:55:54,647
I don't know this
part of town at all.

1419
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,689
My first interview,
and I'm going to blow it

1420
00:55:56,756 --> 00:55:58,189
because I can't find the house.

1421
00:55:58,257 --> 00:55:59,986
Turn it, turn it!

1422
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:01,424
Oh, no, do you believe this?

1423
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:02,791
God, I'm really
going to be late.

1424
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:04,386
You know what?
Dickie to the rescue.

1425
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:05,522
I've got an idea.

1426
00:56:05,598 --> 00:56:06,963
Let me see that address.

1427
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:11,965
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

1428
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:13,733
Oh, my God, there's a fire

1429
00:56:13,806 --> 00:56:16,798
at the McHenry house,
368 North Hobart Street!

1430
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:18,138
Hurry!

1431
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,483
Follow those fire trucks.

1432
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:26,745
Come on, Mommy.

1433
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:29,219
Unbelievable.

1434
00:56:32,592 --> 00:56:34,116
You think a false alarm
is funny?

1435
00:56:34,193 --> 00:56:35,592
You think it's okay
to phone in a fire?!

1436
00:56:35,661 --> 00:56:36,593
Well, it's called

1437
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:38,095
being aggressive towards
your career, you know?

1438
00:56:38,164 --> 00:56:39,426
You want something,
you gotta work at it.

1439
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:40,591
That's day-one stuff.

1440
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:42,566
You know what, no matter
how much you want something,

1441
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:43,897
you don't trample others
to get it,

1442
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,870
and you certainly
don't break the law.

1443
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:47,906
You've been nothing
but a disruptive influence,

1444
00:56:47,974 --> 00:56:48,963
ever since you got here.

1445
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,770
Well, I'm learning,
and that's the point,

1446
00:56:50,843 --> 00:56:51,969
but don't kick me out.

1447
00:56:52,044 --> 00:56:56,174
I got nowhere else to go.
I got nowhere else to go!

1448
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:57,841
Why does that sound familiar?

1449
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,179
It's from An Officer
and a Gentleman.

1450
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:00,276
That's what Richard Gere said.

1451
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:01,445
See? I'm a good actor.

1452
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:02,688
That's it! Out!

1453
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:04,052
I want you out right now!

1454
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:06,182
I don't care what arrangement
you have with my husband.

1455
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:07,385
I won't tolerate
this anymore!

1456
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,392
No, come on.

1457
00:57:08,461 --> 00:57:09,621
-Dickie, no...!
-Please!

1458
00:57:09,695 --> 00:57:11,629
-No! Oh!
-Listen...

1459
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:16,293
Oh, no!

1460
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:18,633
Dickie! Ah!

1461
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:36,478
-Go! Go! Go, now! I mean it!
-Hey, ow!

1462
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:39,150
You don't understand,
I know I'm screwed up.

1463
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:40,385
I have no center.

1464
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,859
I'm completely lost.

1465
00:57:41,928 --> 00:57:44,761
Look at me, I'm a massive
failure as a human being.

1466
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:46,423
I wear gloves 24 hours a day.

1467
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:49,468
Why? Because I'm afraid
to physically touch anything

1468
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:50,797
or anyone.

1469
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:53,304
I don't want people
to look in my eyes

1470
00:57:53,372 --> 00:57:55,840
'cause they'll realize
there's nothing there.

1471
00:57:55,908 --> 00:57:58,433
I'm a complete and total mess.

1472
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:00,445
Grace, do you think
you could take

1473
00:58:00,513 --> 00:58:02,572
your little dysfunctional
family fight inside?

1474
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:04,513
We don't need to see
your dirty laundry.

1475
00:58:04,584 --> 00:58:06,051
Mrs. Gertrude, please, okay?

1476
00:58:06,118 --> 00:58:07,551
Just blow it out your ass!

1477
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,747
This is between me
and my family.

1478
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,182
Well!

1479
00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:13,657
-Mom, that was awesome!
-Mom, that was awesome!

1480
00:58:13,726 --> 00:58:15,956
Wait a second.

1481
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:17,791
Why did you say that?

1482
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:20,424
Is that because I told you
to stand up for yourself?

1483
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,297
It is.
See, Grace?

1484
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:23,801
I-I'm not totally useless.

1485
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,633
Dickie, this whole thing
is just crazy.

1486
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:27,502
I mean, you can't just
observe a family

1487
00:58:27,573 --> 00:58:28,505
and learn how to be.

1488
00:58:28,574 --> 00:58:30,701
You know, it's not like
monkey-see, monkey-do.

1489
00:58:30,776 --> 00:58:31,674
It's more than that.

1490
00:58:31,744 --> 00:58:34,713
You don't understand.
I'm desperate.

1491
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,078
If I become a star again,
everyone will come back.

1492
00:58:37,149 --> 00:58:38,980
My mom will come home,
just like before.

1493
00:58:39,085 --> 00:58:41,349
Dickie, it's not supposed
to work that way.

1494
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,379
I know, but can I hope
for anything different?

1495
00:58:49,562 --> 00:58:51,189
Grace, please.

1496
00:58:53,466 --> 00:58:54,433
I need this part.

1497
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,489
I need it so bad,

1498
00:58:55,568 --> 00:58:58,162
that I don't know
if I can go on without it.

1499
00:58:58,237 --> 00:59:00,569
Hey, Mom?

1500
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,939
Maybe we could give Dickie
just one last chance?

1501
00:59:04,043 --> 00:59:05,601
Yeah, Mom.

1502
00:59:05,678 --> 00:59:07,475
He could do better.

1503
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:09,139
I mean, if we help.

1504
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:13,610
What's Popeye got in his mouth?

1505
00:59:13,686 --> 00:59:15,381
My gosh, it's a dead rabbit.

1506
00:59:15,454 --> 00:59:16,386
Oh, my God.

1507
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:17,888
It's the Gertrudes' pet rabbit.

1508
00:59:17,957 --> 00:59:19,891
Popeye killed their pet rabbit.

1509
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:21,950
Popeye bad dog!

1510
00:59:22,028 --> 00:59:23,120
What are we going to do?

1511
00:59:23,195 --> 00:59:24,321
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1512
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:25,329
Popeye must have gotten

1513
00:59:25,398 --> 00:59:26,592
into the backyard cage
and killed him.

1514
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,099
God, they're already
mad at us.

1515
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:29,828
Now we're in all kinds
of trouble.

1516
00:59:29,902 --> 00:59:31,631
Wait a second.

1517
00:59:31,704 --> 00:59:33,069
We can fix this.

1518
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:34,538
Rub-a-dub-dub,
bunny in the tub.

1519
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:36,074
Do you think
we should shampoo it?

1520
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:38,702
Do you have any "Gee, Your Dead
Rabbit Smells Terrific"?

1521
00:59:38,778 --> 00:59:39,904
Oh.

1522
00:59:39,979 --> 00:59:41,139
No, but I have V05.

1523
00:59:41,213 --> 00:59:43,647
We'll put in
some leave-in conditioner

1524
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:44,648
and a protein pack.

1525
00:59:44,717 --> 00:59:46,150
This thing will look
good as new

1526
00:59:46,218 --> 00:59:47,845
except for the being dead part.

1527
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,887
Stop it.

1528
00:59:48,955 --> 00:59:50,354
I think we better start
to blow-dry it soon.

1529
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:51,549
Then I'm going
to go get a brush.

1530
00:59:51,624 --> 00:59:52,556
Hurry.

1531
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:53,557
Okay, tell you what.

1532
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:54,684
I'll put it back in the cage

1533
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,228
all clean and when
the Gertrudes come home,

1534
00:59:57,296 --> 00:59:58,786
they open the cage

1535
00:59:58,864 --> 01:00:01,628
and they think it dies
of natural causes.

1536
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:02,998
It's the perfect plan.

1537
01:00:03,135 --> 01:00:06,298
You guys, the Gertrudes--
I think they're coming home.

1538
01:00:06,372 --> 01:00:07,634
All right, let's go.
Okay, okay, dry it.

1539
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:08,639
Here, here.

1540
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:09,640
Here we go.

1541
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:10,801
Dry it, dry it, dry it.

1542
01:00:28,995 --> 01:00:31,429
Okay, it's back in the cage.

1543
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:33,021
We're totally off the hook.

1544
01:00:33,132 --> 01:00:35,191
Hey, what's in the cage?

1545
01:00:35,267 --> 01:00:36,256
It's Peter! Oh, no!

1546
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:38,030
Devil rabbit.

1547
01:00:38,137 --> 01:00:39,661
Devil rabbit, devil rabbit!

1548
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:42,674
Mr. and Mrs. Gertrude,
what's wrong?

1549
01:00:42,742 --> 01:00:43,902
Our pet bunny died two days ago.

1550
01:00:43,976 --> 01:00:45,136
We buried it over there.

1551
01:00:45,211 --> 01:00:47,236
And now he's back in the cage!

1552
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:49,042
Oh, Satan taunts us!

1553
01:00:49,148 --> 01:00:50,046
Oh, devil rabbit!

1554
01:00:50,182 --> 01:00:52,047
That is a sign from hell!

1555
01:00:52,151 --> 01:00:53,846
It means move out of that house.

1556
01:00:53,919 --> 01:00:55,352
Move!

1557
01:00:55,421 --> 01:00:56,649
Spirits of rabbits.

1558
01:00:56,722 --> 01:00:58,314
Devil rabbit!
Devil rabbit!

1559
01:00:58,391 --> 01:01:00,325
Woo! Get out!

1560
01:01:03,996 --> 01:01:05,691
There they go.
They're moving out.

1561
01:01:05,765 --> 01:01:07,630
Devil rabbit!

1562
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,133
Devil rabbit.

1563
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,198
That was fun.

1564
01:01:16,275 --> 01:01:18,607
So, can I stay?

1565
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:27,811
So those three bullies
don't bug you anymore?

1566
01:01:27,887 --> 01:01:29,354
I knew it, they're morons.

1567
01:01:30,423 --> 01:01:31,822
Hey, what do you call
this hairstyle again?

1568
01:01:31,891 --> 01:01:32,823
The Tiger-Do.

1569
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:34,826
Looks cool, right, Sam?

1570
01:01:34,894 --> 01:01:35,656
Yeah, man.

1571
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:36,854
Bitchin' cool style, man.

1572
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:37,861
I love it.

1573
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,192
What's this one,
the porcupine? Oh, oh.

1574
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:41,665
So, what do you want
to do today, Dickie?

1575
01:01:41,734 --> 01:01:44,032
First up, teach me
how to ride a bike.

1576
01:01:44,103 --> 01:01:45,035
Yeah!

1577
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:47,605
I'm pedaling.
I think I got it.

1578
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:48,697
Let him go.

1579
01:01:48,774 --> 01:01:51,038
Go. Go. Go. Go.

1580
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,134
Go for it!

1581
01:01:52,211 --> 01:01:53,473
I'm doing it.

1582
01:01:56,048 --> 01:01:57,174
Dickie, are you okay?

1583
01:01:57,249 --> 01:01:59,012
Ow!

1584
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:00,882
Who put that truck there?

1585
01:02:00,953 --> 01:02:01,977
Are you all right?

1586
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:03,350
Oh, wow.

1587
01:02:03,422 --> 01:02:06,755
Oh. I'm seeing birds and bells
and beautiful girls.

1588
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:09,226
Sam, front and center
on the double.

1589
01:02:09,295 --> 01:02:11,092
We're just moving in
to this house.

1590
01:02:11,163 --> 01:02:12,653
Oh, well, we got a new neighbor.

1591
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:14,199
What do you think of that, Sam?

1592
01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:17,994
Sam, you want to say hello
to the new neighbor?

1593
01:02:18,137 --> 01:02:20,002
Hello.

1594
01:02:20,106 --> 01:02:21,869
Hi.

1595
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:23,374
He had you at hello, didn't he?

1596
01:02:23,442 --> 01:02:25,239
Listen, these guys
are teaching me

1597
01:02:25,311 --> 01:02:27,006
how to ride a bike.
You want to come with?

1598
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:28,103
-Sure.
-All right, let's go.

1599
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,875
Yeah!

1600
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:31,678
Whoa!

1601
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:34,845
Ow.

1602
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:52,797
Oh-oh.

1603
01:02:52,872 --> 01:02:53,998
Whoa.

1604
01:02:54,073 --> 01:02:56,132
Did you ever have such a bad
wipe-out you don't even feel it?

1605
01:02:57,276 --> 01:02:58,800
That wasn't one of them.

1606
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:03,348
Here you go, guys.

1607
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:04,347
Thanks, Mrs. Finney.

1608
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:05,348
Thanks a lot.

1609
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:06,884
You okay?

1610
01:03:06,952 --> 01:03:08,283
I munched it out there.

1611
01:03:08,354 --> 01:03:09,343
You're all right.

1612
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:10,911
So you're really
going to help me?

1613
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,617
Yes, of course
I'm going to help you.

1614
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:15,922
If someone doesn't step in soon,
you might kill yourself.

1615
01:03:15,995 --> 01:03:16,927
Look, Dickie, you've

1616
01:03:16,996 --> 01:03:18,554
been going about
this thing all wrong.

1617
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:20,656
You know, there's no rhyme
or reason to your plan.

1618
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:22,792
You're like a chicken running
around with its head cut off.

1619
01:03:22,868 --> 01:03:23,994
I am.

1620
01:03:24,103 --> 01:03:26,094
A chicken with his head chopped
off, that's a good analogy.

1621
01:03:26,172 --> 01:03:27,264
Stop it.

1622
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:28,271
Okay,

1623
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,432
but if you want my help,

1624
01:03:29,508 --> 01:03:31,305
you play by my rules
and my rules only.

1625
01:03:31,377 --> 01:03:33,277
Okay?
So first, the gloves.

1626
01:03:33,345 --> 01:03:34,972
Off they go.

1627
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:36,309
Wait a minute.

1628
01:03:36,382 --> 01:03:37,440
Dickie, for this to work,

1629
01:03:37,516 --> 01:03:39,313
we've got to almost reboot you,
like a human computer.

1630
01:03:39,385 --> 01:03:41,285
Not the gloves,
anything but the gloves.

1631
01:03:41,353 --> 01:03:42,285
Okay, well.

1632
01:03:42,354 --> 01:03:43,514
Okay, okay.

1633
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:45,982
But I just want you to know

1634
01:03:46,058 --> 01:03:47,855
that this is like me asking you
to take your top off.

1635
01:03:47,927 --> 01:03:49,360
Which is crazy, right?

1636
01:03:49,428 --> 01:03:50,793
Dickie.

1637
01:03:50,863 --> 01:03:52,262
Right.

1638
01:03:57,236 --> 01:03:58,794
Oh, air... Ow.

1639
01:04:01,073 --> 01:04:02,506
I don't like it.

1640
01:04:02,575 --> 01:04:03,940
Happy?

1641
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:05,306
Yes. See?

1642
01:04:05,377 --> 01:04:06,810
Grace?

1643
01:04:06,879 --> 01:04:08,972
There are men in stilts
plastering in there.

1644
01:04:09,081 --> 01:04:11,208
Is this part
of your interior design thing?

1645
01:04:11,283 --> 01:04:13,274
No, George, it was damaged
from the water bed accident.

1646
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,685
Dickie what the hell
did you do to your hair?

1647
01:04:16,755 --> 01:04:19,383
Oh. I dyed it.

1648
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,789
It no come out so good.

1649
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:21,849
Look, it was my idea, okay?

1650
01:04:21,927 --> 01:04:22,985
People were recognizing him

1651
01:04:23,062 --> 01:04:24,859
and he was being distracted
from his project.

1652
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:27,194
He was going to do a commercial
for me, Grace.

1653
01:04:27,266 --> 01:04:29,826
George, he's already paying you
a lot of money

1654
01:04:29,902 --> 01:04:31,199
to be here,
isn't that enough?

1655
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,295
I had a lot of plans for him.

1656
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:34,532
He's a human being, okay?

1657
01:04:34,607 --> 01:04:36,632
He's not just some product
for you to use.

1658
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:38,267
All right.

1659
01:04:38,344 --> 01:04:42,371
Wow, I feel like you have
completely undermined me here.

1660
01:04:42,448 --> 01:04:44,575
I'm going out.

1661
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:50,484
Oh, boy.

1662
01:04:56,829 --> 01:04:58,387
What?

1663
01:04:58,464 --> 01:05:01,194
That was, like, the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

1664
01:05:01,267 --> 01:05:03,258
What is?

1665
01:05:03,335 --> 01:05:04,893
That I'm not some product.

1666
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:08,098
Wow.

1667
01:05:08,173 --> 01:05:11,404
Then, as Hallmark cards go,
you'd be easy to please.

1668
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:19,417
Listen, l... I'm sorry
George is mad at you.

1669
01:05:19,485 --> 01:05:20,509
Is that because of me?

1670
01:05:20,586 --> 01:05:21,985
No, but that's good.

1671
01:05:22,054 --> 01:05:24,955
You're starting to think
like a real kid.

1672
01:05:25,024 --> 01:05:27,891
Kids always think it's their
fault when parents split up.

1673
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,157
Is that what's going to
happen to you and George?

1674
01:05:38,704 --> 01:05:40,604
I don't know.

1675
01:05:42,374 --> 01:05:44,638
You know, I do
everything I can think of

1676
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:46,644
to keep it together
for the kids.

1677
01:05:47,613 --> 01:05:49,672
I'm a mom first, but...

1678
01:05:49,748 --> 01:05:53,013
George makes me feel so guilty
for even wanting a career,

1679
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:55,451
you know, like it makes me
less of a mom.

1680
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:58,513
Well, I got news for you.

1681
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:01,423
They don't even write TV
moms as good as you are.

1682
01:06:02,928 --> 01:06:04,896
Well now, we're even.

1683
01:06:04,964 --> 01:06:07,956
Because that's the nicest
compliment I've ever heard.

1684
01:06:12,571 --> 01:06:15,768
You know, we probably should
dye your hair back.

1685
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:17,468
Yeah.

1686
01:06:17,543 --> 01:06:19,238
Well, since you're going
to be here a while,

1687
01:06:19,311 --> 01:06:21,074
I think I should read
this script.

1688
01:06:21,146 --> 01:06:23,137
See what it is
you want so badly.

1689
01:06:23,215 --> 01:06:24,682
Please do.

1690
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,184
Maybe you can make
some sense of it.

1691
01:06:28,253 --> 01:06:29,345
No, no, no, no, no.

1692
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:32,256
I don't know what to do.

1693
01:06:32,324 --> 01:06:33,848
No gloves.

1694
01:06:33,926 --> 01:06:36,292
Don't need 'em.

1695
01:06:37,563 --> 01:06:38,860
Dickie, you promised
to help me

1696
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:39,989
with my pep squad tryouts.

1697
01:06:40,132 --> 01:06:41,156
Oh, I will.

1698
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:42,894
That pep squad spot's
got your name all over it.

1699
01:06:42,968 --> 01:06:45,801
Did I ever tell you I was a
backup dancer for Vanilla lce?

1700
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:46,860
No way.

1701
01:06:46,939 --> 01:06:48,600
Oh, yeah, I owe him a call.

1702
01:06:58,217 --> 01:06:59,013
Boom.

1703
01:07:25,377 --> 01:07:26,935
We're right on time.

1704
01:07:27,012 --> 01:07:28,309
-Are you sure?
-Yep, yep.

1705
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:30,609
All right.
Here we go.

1706
01:07:30,682 --> 01:07:32,081
You got the words down?

1707
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:33,277
I think so, yeah.

1708
01:07:33,352 --> 01:07:34,751
I think you do, too.

1709
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:35,878
I drew this up last night.

1710
01:07:35,954 --> 01:07:37,148
These are your dance steps.

1711
01:07:38,724 --> 01:07:41,352
Okay, girls, come on, let's go.

1712
01:07:41,427 --> 01:07:42,985
It's time to start.

1713
01:07:43,062 --> 01:07:46,259
Our first contestant
is Heather Bolan.

1714
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:49,232
Hey, Stallions,
I got a message for you.

1715
01:07:49,301 --> 01:07:51,895
And it goes like this.

1716
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:54,936
Oh

1717
01:07:56,475 --> 01:07:57,100
I, l

1718
01:07:57,176 --> 01:07:58,768
I

1719
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:05,706
I wanna be bad with you, baby

1720
01:08:05,784 --> 01:08:06,842
I, l...

1721
01:08:06,919 --> 01:08:08,216
I, l

1722
01:08:08,287 --> 01:08:12,553
I wanna be bad with you, baby

1723
01:08:13,725 --> 01:08:14,783
Do you

1724
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:17,488
Understand what I need from you?

1725
01:08:17,563 --> 01:08:20,930
Just let me be the girl
to show you, you

1726
01:08:20,999 --> 01:08:23,433
Everything that she can be
is everything that I can be

1727
01:08:23,502 --> 01:08:24,594
I wanna be

1728
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:25,728
My turn

1729
01:08:25,804 --> 01:08:28,398
Let me let you know that I can

1730
01:08:28,474 --> 01:08:30,135
Promise that I won't do that

1731
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:33,975
So, boy, l-I wanna be bad

1732
01:08:34,046 --> 01:08:36,071
You make bad feel so good

1733
01:08:36,148 --> 01:08:38,708
I'm losing all my cool

1734
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:41,878
I'm about to break the rules

1735
01:08:41,954 --> 01:08:44,650
I, I wanna be bad.

1736
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:46,958
Thank you.

1737
01:08:51,964 --> 01:08:53,329
Slut.

1738
01:08:55,033 --> 01:08:57,934
Our next contestant,
Sally Finney.

1739
01:08:59,371 --> 01:09:01,464
Have fun.
Just have fun, okay?

1740
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,598
You're good.
You know it.

1741
01:09:19,224 --> 01:09:20,953
It is the night

1742
01:09:21,093 --> 01:09:22,287
My body's weak

1743
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:24,959
I'm on the run

1744
01:09:25,097 --> 01:09:26,155
No time to sleep

1745
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:29,098
I've got to ride

1746
01:09:29,168 --> 01:09:31,193
Ride like the wind

1747
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:32,532
To be free again

1748
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,670
And I've got
such a long way to go

1749
01:09:37,743 --> 01:09:39,711
Such a long way to go

1750
01:09:39,778 --> 01:09:42,713
To make it to the border
of Mexico

1751
01:09:42,781 --> 01:09:44,373
So I'll ride

1752
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:46,440
Like the wind

1753
01:09:46,518 --> 01:09:47,678
Ride like the wind

1754
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:51,048
Gonna ride like the wind.

1755
01:10:08,607 --> 01:10:10,370
Oh, that was great!

1756
01:10:15,214 --> 01:10:16,909
Yeah!

1757
01:10:16,982 --> 01:10:18,347
That was perfect.

1758
01:10:18,417 --> 01:10:19,816
Sally, I'm so proud of you.

1759
01:10:19,885 --> 01:10:20,852
Yippee!

1760
01:10:26,191 --> 01:10:28,455
Oh, good morning, everybody.

1761
01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:29,926
Ooh, I had a rough night.

1762
01:10:29,995 --> 01:10:31,019
First time I tried

1763
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:33,587
sleeping without my gloves on
in ten years.

1764
01:10:33,665 --> 01:10:35,394
Insane in the membrane.

1765
01:10:35,467 --> 01:10:36,866
Hey, Dickie, okay.

1766
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:38,960
I saw Barbie outside and
I started talking to her,

1767
01:10:39,037 --> 01:10:41,198
but I got all tongue-tied
and I wasn't making sense.

1768
01:10:41,273 --> 01:10:42,240
I know.

1769
01:10:42,307 --> 01:10:45,743
It sounded like you said,
"l love meat loaf."

1770
01:10:45,811 --> 01:10:47,745
Oh, so you could understand
that part.

1771
01:10:47,813 --> 01:10:50,008
All right, I think that's going
to need a little work, buddy.

1772
01:10:50,082 --> 01:10:51,344
Nothing against
meat loaf though.

1773
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:53,179
All right, why don't you
tots run off to school?

1774
01:10:53,252 --> 01:10:54,412
I'm going to grab
a cup of java.

1775
01:10:54,486 --> 01:10:55,418
Bye, Dickie.

1776
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,419
Bye, Dickie.

1777
01:10:56,488 --> 01:10:57,455
Bye.

1778
01:10:57,522 --> 01:10:59,217
Ooh, morning.

1779
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:00,223
Morning.

1780
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:01,452
Never needed this stuff more.

1781
01:11:01,526 --> 01:11:02,891
No. No coffee.

1782
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:03,893
Kids don't drink coffee.

1783
01:11:03,962 --> 01:11:04,929
What? That's crazy.

1784
01:11:04,997 --> 01:11:05,929
Juice.

1785
01:11:05,998 --> 01:11:07,431
No, coffee in the morning.

1786
01:11:07,499 --> 01:11:09,399
Shh. Dickie, I got to talk
to you about this script.

1787
01:11:09,468 --> 01:11:11,993
I know why you want to do
this movie so much.

1788
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:14,630
I read it last night.
It's wonderful.

1789
01:11:14,706 --> 01:11:16,003
Really?

1790
01:11:16,074 --> 01:11:17,701
Please, can you
explain it to me?

1791
01:11:17,776 --> 01:11:19,801
Okay, Mr. Blake

1792
01:11:19,878 --> 01:11:22,312
discovers that heaven
is in his own backyard.

1793
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:23,313
Oh, wait.

1794
01:11:23,382 --> 01:11:24,781
That's... I didn't
get that part.

1795
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,112
Like heaven, like real heaven?

1796
01:11:26,184 --> 01:11:28,152
Yes, he's this billionaire,

1797
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,653
and he buys
this mysterious plot of land

1798
01:11:29,721 --> 01:11:31,484
and he wants to build
the biggest house

1799
01:11:31,556 --> 01:11:32,488
of all time on it.

1800
01:11:32,557 --> 01:11:33,751
To be admired
by the whole world.

1801
01:11:33,825 --> 01:11:35,690
Right on.
Well, that sounds like me.

1802
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:37,023
They should just
give me that part.

1803
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:38,823
Here's the problem.

1804
01:11:38,897 --> 01:11:41,832
The bigger he builds
this giant house,

1805
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,063
the smaller heaven becomes
in his backyard.

1806
01:11:46,371 --> 01:11:47,303
Hmm.

1807
01:11:47,372 --> 01:11:48,634
But he still has
a big house, right?

1808
01:11:48,707 --> 01:11:50,231
Have you ever seen MTV Cribs?

1809
01:11:50,309 --> 01:11:51,503
Tommy Lee has a sex room.

1810
01:11:51,576 --> 01:11:53,669
And how come all the
rappers have a video

1811
01:11:53,745 --> 01:11:55,042
of Scarface going all the time?

1812
01:11:55,113 --> 01:11:57,411
Yeah, okay, meanwhile,

1813
01:11:57,482 --> 01:12:01,509
there's this woman, Esmerelda,
she's Mr. Blake's housekeeper,

1814
01:12:01,586 --> 01:12:03,986
and he falls madly
in love with her, right?

1815
01:12:04,056 --> 01:12:05,080
And then she dies.

1816
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:08,388
Wait.
She die-dies?

1817
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,360
I thought
this was a happy movie.

1818
01:12:10,429 --> 01:12:11,760
Oh, it is.

1819
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:14,424
Esmerelda goes to heaven...
you see,

1820
01:12:14,499 --> 01:12:16,091
so by discovering true love,

1821
01:12:16,168 --> 01:12:19,194
Mr. Blake's able to see
the heaven in his own backyard--

1822
01:12:19,271 --> 01:12:21,102
the heaven that was
always there,

1823
01:12:21,173 --> 01:12:22,834
only he couldn't see it--

1824
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:25,274
so he tears down
this enormous house,

1825
01:12:25,344 --> 01:12:27,642
and he lives in his own backyard
in a little shack...

1826
01:12:27,713 --> 01:12:31,114
and it's all
to be near Esmerelda.

1827
01:12:31,183 --> 01:12:32,616
Do you see, Dickie?

1828
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:34,982
Do you see
what that story means?

1829
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:38,117
I don't. No.

1830
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:39,714
I don't understand any of it.

1831
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,791
-Now, come on.
-No!

1832
01:12:42,861 --> 01:12:44,158
No coffee.

1833
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:46,129
Here, have a nice bowl
of cereal instead.

1834
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:47,290
Cereal?

1835
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:49,197
I've been drinking coffee
since I was three.

1836
01:12:49,267 --> 01:12:50,199
I need a pick-me-up.

1837
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:51,860
Too bad.

1838
01:12:51,937 --> 01:12:54,303
Fine, cereal it is.

1839
01:12:54,373 --> 01:12:56,500
Oh, my gosh,
there's a prize inside.

1840
01:12:59,144 --> 01:13:00,441
There's a prize...

1841
01:13:02,981 --> 01:13:04,073
Hey, you guys!

1842
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:05,707
-Hey, Dickie.
-Hey, Dickie.

1843
01:13:05,784 --> 01:13:06,944
What do we have planned next?

1844
01:13:07,018 --> 01:13:08,747
Oh, your Mom's got a lot
of stuff planned.

1845
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,980
-Yeah.
-Like what?

1846
01:13:10,055 --> 01:13:10,987
Like what?

1847
01:13:11,089 --> 01:13:13,114
You're crazy.

1848
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,217
Whoa.

1849
01:13:15,293 --> 01:13:17,193
Hello, Dickie.

1850
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:19,355
I've missed you.

1851
01:13:19,431 --> 01:13:21,592
So, this guy
totally kidnapped me

1852
01:13:21,666 --> 01:13:22,997
when I was hitchhiking
that day,

1853
01:13:23,101 --> 01:13:25,433
and he was totally weird
with, like, this great haircut,

1854
01:13:25,504 --> 01:13:28,166
so I was actually fooled
into thinking that he was okay,

1855
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,003
you know?

1856
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:31,007
So I finally escaped,

1857
01:13:31,143 --> 01:13:32,701
and I went back
to Dickie's apartment,

1858
01:13:32,778 --> 01:13:35,110
and Dickie was gone,
and I was, like,

1859
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:38,445
"Well, I have got
to see my Dickie."

1860
01:13:38,517 --> 01:13:40,007
Um, right.

1861
01:13:40,118 --> 01:13:41,585
Uh, l...

1862
01:13:41,653 --> 01:13:43,450
I'm doing this thing here,
Cyndi, and...

1863
01:13:43,522 --> 01:13:45,217
I just don't know

1864
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:46,518
if it's a great idea
if you're around,

1865
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:50,425
only because I'm trying
to focus on the plan.

1866
01:13:50,495 --> 01:13:52,963
Um, I'm thinking if we, uh,
up your rent

1867
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:55,761
a little bit, there's
really no reason why

1868
01:13:55,834 --> 01:13:57,597
Cyndi can't stay in the den.

1869
01:13:57,669 --> 01:13:58,363
What?

1870
01:13:58,437 --> 01:14:00,803
Oh, Dickie, thank you.

1871
01:14:00,872 --> 01:14:02,806
Thank you.

1872
01:14:02,874 --> 01:14:04,603
Oh, baby.

1873
01:14:04,676 --> 01:14:06,439
Wha... George?

1874
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,978
Baby, I have saved up
a sexual experience

1875
01:14:11,049 --> 01:14:12,573
of a lifetime for you,

1876
01:14:12,651 --> 01:14:16,417
but first, let's loosen things
up a bit,

1877
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:18,422
Iight some candles,

1878
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:20,424
drink some champagne.

1879
01:14:20,492 --> 01:14:22,960
-Okay.
-Okay.

1880
01:14:23,028 --> 01:14:24,256
Do it.

1881
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:25,591
Oh, me, yeah.

1882
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:44,114
Get out of here, gross dog.

1883
01:14:55,894 --> 01:14:58,863
-Hmm-mm-mm!
-Hmm-mm-mm!

1884
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:01,398
Taittinger, the finest bubbly.

1885
01:15:01,466 --> 01:15:02,626
Do you like that painting?

1886
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:03,497
Huh?

1887
01:15:05,003 --> 01:15:06,095
Ow!

1888
01:15:06,171 --> 01:15:08,139
Oh... whoo, got ya.

1889
01:15:08,206 --> 01:15:09,969
Got away from me.

1890
01:15:10,108 --> 01:15:12,133
Ooh, this baby is wound up.

1891
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,734
Incoming!

1892
01:15:13,812 --> 01:15:14,801
Ow.

1893
01:15:17,482 --> 01:15:18,949
You're fine, you're fine.

1894
01:15:19,985 --> 01:15:21,953
No blood. Cheers.

1895
01:15:25,156 --> 01:15:27,420
-Nice.
-Yuck.

1896
01:15:27,492 --> 01:15:31,258
So... relax, let me tell you
about this family.

1897
01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:33,422
Oh... I'm having a good time.

1898
01:15:33,498 --> 01:15:35,261
They are great.

1899
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:37,096
Well, George, he's the dad.

1900
01:15:37,168 --> 01:15:40,433
He's a little... off,
but Sam-- he's a great kid.

1901
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:41,563
He... he's funny.

1902
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,937
He doesn't know
how great he is,

1903
01:15:43,008 --> 01:15:44,942
because he's always
getting bullied at school,

1904
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,944
and it took away
all his confidence.

1905
01:15:47,012 --> 01:15:48,604
He has a crush
on this girl next door,

1906
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,272
and I'm helping him
with that, but...

1907
01:15:50,348 --> 01:15:52,282
uh, you probably don't want
to hear all this.

1908
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,944
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

1909
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,113
And Sally is cute,
and smart, and funny,

1910
01:15:57,188 --> 01:15:58,951
and just the other day
I was telling her...

1911
01:15:59,024 --> 01:16:01,219
Yeah? Wow, that's
really interesting,

1912
01:16:01,293 --> 01:16:03,887
um, but that Grace--
she's a real looker...

1913
01:16:03,962 --> 01:16:06,226
in her own way... I guess.

1914
01:16:06,298 --> 01:16:08,732
Grace... Wow, l...

1915
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,734
Mom? I never thought
of her like that.

1916
01:16:10,802 --> 01:16:12,394
That's funny.

1917
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,734
Yeah, right, like
you hadn't noticed?

1918
01:16:14,806 --> 01:16:16,398
Come on, and you
think I didn't notice

1919
01:16:16,474 --> 01:16:18,237
that George is hot?

1920
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:20,073
You haven't changed, Dickie.

1921
01:16:20,145 --> 01:16:21,942
You just think you have.

1922
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,743
So, are we going to do
this sex or not,

1923
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:29,787
because I kind of want
to get it over with.

1924
01:16:30,822 --> 01:16:32,255
Maybe we shouldn't, you know?

1925
01:16:32,324 --> 01:16:34,224
Maybe-maybe it's not
a good idea tonight.

1926
01:16:35,293 --> 01:16:37,386
Wait, y-you're turning me down?

1927
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:40,090
Unbelievable.

1928
01:16:40,165 --> 01:16:43,430
These yokels
are really getting to you.

1929
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:45,264
Okay, well,
if we're not doing it,

1930
01:16:45,337 --> 01:16:47,134
will you at least
put out the damn candles?

1931
01:16:48,873 --> 01:16:51,000
Oh, not this one.
It smells great.

1932
01:16:51,142 --> 01:16:52,268
This is sandalwood vanilla.

1933
01:16:52,344 --> 01:16:53,311
You'd love that.

1934
01:16:53,378 --> 01:16:54,003
Ooh!

1935
01:16:54,145 --> 01:16:55,305
Oh! Oh!

1936
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,245
-Oh, oh!
-Oh, my God.

1937
01:16:57,315 --> 01:16:58,942
I'm on fire, you idiot!

1938
01:16:59,017 --> 01:17:00,041
I'm sorry.

1939
01:17:03,455 --> 01:17:04,922
Hey, pal.

1940
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:09,718
Up-bu-bu-bup, excuse me.

1941
01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:12,058
I thought I told you
not to bother our customers.

1942
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:13,290
Hey, pal, I'm harmless.

1943
01:17:13,365 --> 01:17:15,560
I just want to talk to Robbie
for, like, ten seconds.

1944
01:17:15,634 --> 01:17:17,226
Jerry, Asto,
get rid of this guy.

1945
01:17:17,302 --> 01:17:18,326
Beat it, pal.

1946
01:17:18,403 --> 01:17:19,734
Let's go.

1947
01:17:19,804 --> 01:17:21,101
Oh, it's him!
It's Rob!

1948
01:17:21,172 --> 01:17:22,400
Hey, how you doing?
Nice to see you.

1949
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:23,771
Always a pleasure.
Love your car.

1950
01:17:23,842 --> 01:17:24,968
Oh, yeah, we have,
uh, global warming...

1951
01:17:25,043 --> 01:17:25,975
I understand.

1952
01:17:26,044 --> 01:17:28,774
Hey, Rob, it's me,
Sidney Wernick.

1953
01:17:28,847 --> 01:17:30,405
Rob?

1954
01:17:30,482 --> 01:17:31,574
Oh, he's getting away.

1955
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:33,743
Robbie! Rob!

1956
01:17:33,818 --> 01:17:35,183
It's me, Sidney Wernick.

1957
01:17:35,253 --> 01:17:36,914
I'm Dickie Roberts' agent.

1958
01:17:36,988 --> 01:17:38,353
Give me five seconds.

1959
01:17:39,724 --> 01:17:40,782
Yep, she's a cutie.

1960
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:42,588
I'll give you that.

1961
01:17:42,661 --> 01:17:45,255
A girl that pretty
is never going to like me.

1962
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,265
Come on, have you seen
Ric Ocasek from The Cars?

1963
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:49,925
That guy's rough.

1964
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:51,093
You're way ahead of him.

1965
01:17:51,169 --> 01:17:52,761
Listen, all you got to do
is show her

1966
01:17:52,837 --> 01:17:54,202
what a cool,
funny dude you are.

1967
01:17:54,272 --> 01:17:56,604
But... I'm not good at talking
like you are.

1968
01:17:56,675 --> 01:17:58,336
Well, that's debatable.

1969
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:00,105
Let's talk to your mom about it.

1970
01:18:00,178 --> 01:18:01,543
Maybe she has some ideas.

1971
01:18:01,613 --> 01:18:03,376
No, no. We can't talk
to a mom about this.

1972
01:18:03,448 --> 01:18:05,211
This is stuff
a dad has to help me with,

1973
01:18:05,283 --> 01:18:07,843
you know, man to man.

1974
01:18:14,793 --> 01:18:16,283
I got an idea.

1975
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:18,226
Come here.

1976
01:18:21,466 --> 01:18:24,264
Ooh...

1977
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:39,241
Each day through my window,
I watch her as she passes by

1978
01:18:43,088 --> 01:18:46,751
To have a girl like her

1979
01:18:46,825 --> 01:18:51,057
Is truly a dream come true

1980
01:18:52,564 --> 01:18:56,432
Out of all the fellas
in the world

1981
01:18:56,501 --> 01:19:00,995
She belongs to me

1982
01:19:02,774 --> 01:19:06,107
But it was
just my imagination

1983
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,205
Running away with me

1984
01:19:13,618 --> 01:19:17,213
It was just my imagination

1985
01:19:17,288 --> 01:19:21,554
Running away with me...

1986
01:19:22,961 --> 01:19:24,792
Ho-ho, whoa, Sam!

1987
01:19:24,863 --> 01:19:25,761
Whoa-whoa!

1988
01:19:27,599 --> 01:19:28,930
Ow.

1989
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:33,035
Uh, Barbie...

1990
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:39,976
Uh, Barbie, I was...
I was hoping

1991
01:19:40,044 --> 01:19:42,308
you'd like to go
to a movie with me.

1992
01:19:43,815 --> 01:19:46,045
Yes, Sam, I'll go to a movie
with you.

1993
01:19:48,019 --> 01:19:49,452
Ooh...

1994
01:19:49,521 --> 01:19:50,920
Idiot!

1995
01:19:52,891 --> 01:19:53,983
Yeah, okay.

1996
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:56,093
Yeah, hey, wait,
hold on, here he is.

1997
01:19:56,161 --> 01:19:58,220
Dickie, it's Sidney-- it sounds
like something's wrong.

1998
01:19:58,296 --> 01:19:59,228
What?

1999
01:19:59,297 --> 01:20:00,730
Hey, Sidney, what's up?

2000
01:20:00,799 --> 01:20:03,666
Dickie, turn on the news.

2001
01:20:03,735 --> 01:20:05,396
Famous director Rob Reiner
was the victim

2002
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:07,563
of a road rage incident today
in Hollywood.

2003
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:10,437
Witnesses say that Mr. Reiner
was stopped at a red light

2004
01:20:10,508 --> 01:20:12,601
when a large angry man
pulled Mr. Reiner

2005
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:13,974
out of his Honda lnsight

2006
01:20:14,045 --> 01:20:17,310
and began beating him
for well over a minute.

2007
01:20:17,382 --> 01:20:19,282
Mr. Reiner was rushed
to a nearby hospital,

2008
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:21,011
his only dazed words being,

2009
01:20:21,085 --> 01:20:24,816
"l have no idea what I did
to make that man so angry."

2010
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:29,024
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

2011
01:20:29,093 --> 01:20:30,617
Dickie, I got you an audition.

2012
01:20:30,695 --> 01:20:33,027
You got me that audition?
How?

2013
01:20:33,164 --> 01:20:37,464
Well, it's a long story,
but it's tomorrow at 3:00.

2014
01:20:37,535 --> 01:20:39,799
Tomorrow at 3:00?
I-l-I'm... I'll never be ready.

2015
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:41,304
Well, you got to be ready,

2016
01:20:41,372 --> 01:20:42,964
because the audition's
at the hospital,

2017
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:45,168
and then Rob's going under
for an operation.

2018
01:20:45,243 --> 01:20:46,642
What, an operation?

2019
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:49,043
Well, anyway, long story short,

2020
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:53,048
Rob needs a kidney,
and I'm giving him one of mine.

2021
01:20:53,184 --> 01:20:55,152
We swapped...

2022
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,381
a kidney for an audition.

2023
01:20:57,455 --> 01:20:59,980
You'd better get that job!

2024
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:02,751
Holy crap.

2025
01:21:02,827 --> 01:21:03,885
It's tomorrow.

2026
01:21:03,962 --> 01:21:05,759
I'm not ready.

2027
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,764
Wait.

2028
01:21:07,832 --> 01:21:10,130
I've got an idea.

2029
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:11,691
Okay, here we go.

2030
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:13,100
You're going to be ready,
Dickie.

2031
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:14,103
This is the big one.

2032
01:21:14,172 --> 01:21:15,264
It's Christmas morning.

2033
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:16,932
You're waking up excited.

2034
01:21:17,008 --> 01:21:19,442
You think you heard reindeer
on the roof, okay?

2035
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,705
All right, I'll be
down in a second.

2036
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:25,010
Mom, this was such a good idea
to help Dickie.

2037
01:21:25,149 --> 01:21:27,140
Do you think he could pretend
it's Christmas even though

2038
01:21:27,218 --> 01:21:28,947
-it's not for a while?
-Sure, he can,

2039
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:31,955
and if coming down the stairs
and seeing his first red bicycle

2040
01:21:32,023 --> 01:21:34,457
helps him with his acting
somehow, then...

2041
01:21:34,525 --> 01:21:36,083
huh?

2042
01:21:37,362 --> 01:21:39,262
He really is special, isn't he?

2043
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,025
Who would've thought?

2044
01:21:41,099 --> 01:21:43,294
Yeah, I mean how is it possible
that Stranger Danger

2045
01:21:43,368 --> 01:21:45,029
turned out to be so cool?

2046
01:21:45,103 --> 01:21:46,593
Hey, where's Cyndi?

2047
01:21:46,671 --> 01:21:48,036
I thought she would've
helped him with this.

2048
01:21:48,106 --> 01:21:49,539
Slut.

2049
01:21:53,611 --> 01:21:55,670
Here I come.

2050
01:22:07,325 --> 01:22:09,589
Wow, a bicycle.

2051
01:22:33,351 --> 01:22:35,444
You guys...

2052
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,785
that was... that was great
of you to do this for me.

2053
01:22:38,856 --> 01:22:41,654
Thanks for being so cool
to put this together, but...

2054
01:22:41,726 --> 01:22:43,626
But what?

2055
01:22:43,695 --> 01:22:48,632
but... I guess it's true
you can never go home again.

2056
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:51,134
I mean, I missed out
on the real thing,

2057
01:22:51,202 --> 01:22:53,636
and I don't... I don't think
I'll ever get it back.

2058
01:22:53,705 --> 01:22:57,038
Well, maybe you didn't get
something back.

2059
01:22:57,175 --> 01:22:59,666
Maybe you got something
you never had.

2060
01:22:59,744 --> 01:23:01,109
Dickie...

2061
01:23:03,147 --> 01:23:06,082
...you've been so good
with my family.

2062
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:07,777
You've been so good to me.

2063
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:09,752
You're so different
than the angry, weird guy

2064
01:23:09,821 --> 01:23:12,756
who landed on our doorstep
a month ago.

2065
01:23:12,824 --> 01:23:15,156
You're a joy to have around...

2066
01:23:15,226 --> 01:23:18,662
so... as a present

2067
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:21,460
for all that you've
done to help us.

2068
01:23:24,502 --> 01:23:27,266
This isn't part
of your experiment.

2069
01:23:27,338 --> 01:23:29,329
I got this gift for you.

2070
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:42,445
Candy Land.

2071
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,647
You remembered?

2072
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,521
That's what moms do.

2073
01:23:55,133 --> 01:23:58,193
You grew up, Dickie Roberts.

2074
01:24:11,315 --> 01:24:13,374
That's so unfair!

2075
01:24:21,259 --> 01:24:23,750
I'm really sorry that
you're here, Mr. Reiner.

2076
01:24:23,828 --> 01:24:25,796
Thanks, but why are you sorry?

2077
01:24:25,863 --> 01:24:28,730
It's not like you had anything
to do with that guy going nuts.

2078
01:24:29,867 --> 01:24:31,300
All right.

2079
01:24:31,369 --> 01:24:32,529
Okay.

2080
01:24:32,603 --> 01:24:33,934
You ready to read?

2081
01:24:34,005 --> 01:24:36,030
We-we don't have much time here.

2082
01:24:40,278 --> 01:24:42,803
I think I'm ready.

2083
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,404
Woo! I got the part!

2084
01:24:44,482 --> 01:24:46,109
Yeah. Woo.

2085
01:24:46,184 --> 01:24:48,118
I got it, baby!

2086
01:24:48,186 --> 01:24:50,154
Come here, doggy.

2087
01:24:50,221 --> 01:24:51,950
I got...

2088
01:24:52,023 --> 01:24:53,991
Congratulations.

2089
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,691
Is it hot out here?

2090
01:24:57,762 --> 01:25:01,220
-Oh.
-Oh.

2091
01:25:01,299 --> 01:25:03,597
I got it.

2092
01:25:03,668 --> 01:25:05,602
You guys, I got it.

2093
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:07,661
Where is everybody?

2094
01:25:07,738 --> 01:25:09,296
You guys, are you kidding me?

2095
01:25:09,373 --> 01:25:11,933
I got it. It worked.

2096
01:25:12,009 --> 01:25:13,408
Where are you?

2097
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:15,639
There you are.

2098
01:25:15,713 --> 01:25:16,805
I got the part!

2099
01:25:16,881 --> 01:25:17,905
Oh!

2100
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:19,643
That's wonderful.

2101
01:25:19,717 --> 01:25:22,413
Something's wrong.

2102
01:25:26,023 --> 01:25:27,991
Oh, George and Cyndi?

2103
01:25:28,059 --> 01:25:30,357
George and Cyndi?

2104
01:25:30,428 --> 01:25:32,658
They ran off together?

2105
01:25:33,731 --> 01:25:35,858
So we're going
to film in Hawaii.

2106
01:25:35,933 --> 01:25:38,595
I'm going to be there,
like, six months.

2107
01:25:38,669 --> 01:25:42,127
I sacrificed
so much to get this.

2108
01:25:42,206 --> 01:25:44,640
Sidney gave up his kidney.

2109
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:46,438
I'll send you guys some money.

2110
01:25:46,511 --> 01:25:48,001
No. No, Dickie.

2111
01:25:48,112 --> 01:25:50,103
Please, don't worry about us.

2112
01:25:50,181 --> 01:25:51,546
You're not responsible for us.

2113
01:25:51,616 --> 01:25:53,015
I'm not?

2114
01:25:53,084 --> 01:25:54,608
I sometimes feel like I am.
I mean...

2115
01:25:54,685 --> 01:25:55,777
George didn't just

2116
01:25:55,853 --> 01:25:57,787
suddenly lose his head,
you know?

2117
01:25:57,855 --> 01:26:01,188
Something like this was going
to happen sooner or later.

2118
01:26:01,259 --> 01:26:03,318
Dickie, it's not your fault.

2119
01:26:03,394 --> 01:26:05,624
It's his fault.

2120
01:26:07,098 --> 01:26:09,658
Did she take the rest
of your money?

2121
01:26:12,136 --> 01:26:14,070
Yeah.

2122
01:26:14,138 --> 01:26:16,106
Yeah, but I don't care,
you know?

2123
01:26:18,442 --> 01:26:20,376
It was never about the money.

2124
01:26:20,444 --> 01:26:23,072
It was about something more
than that.

2125
01:26:25,816 --> 01:26:28,341
And now you have that, right?

2126
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,481
Yeah.

2127
01:26:31,556 --> 01:26:33,751
I have everything
I always wanted.

2128
01:26:38,162 --> 01:26:40,153
And I have you to thank.

2129
01:26:40,231 --> 01:26:41,926
Dickie.

2130
01:26:45,136 --> 01:26:47,730
Go find your happiness.

2131
01:26:47,805 --> 01:26:49,773
Wherever that takes you.

2132
01:27:11,862 --> 01:27:12,760
Dickie, Dickie...

2133
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:14,229
It'll just take one
minute of your time.

2134
01:27:14,298 --> 01:27:16,266
What does it feel like to be
living the Hollywood dream?

2135
01:27:16,334 --> 01:27:17,528
Dickie, over here.

2136
01:27:17,602 --> 01:27:19,160
We want to interview
the comeback kid

2137
01:27:19,237 --> 01:27:20,169
for Hollywood Scene.

2138
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:21,500
Sally, come on.

2139
01:27:21,572 --> 01:27:22,971
Dickie,

2140
01:27:23,107 --> 01:27:24,768
Jann Carl,
from Entertainment Tonight.

2141
01:27:24,842 --> 01:27:26,742
Look, we want
to do an exclusive interview.

2142
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:27,800
It's an amazing story.

2143
01:27:27,878 --> 01:27:29,311
You have climbed your way back.

2144
01:28:10,021 --> 01:28:11,249
Folks, it looks like

2145
01:28:11,322 --> 01:28:12,880
we'll be departing here
on time today.

2146
01:28:12,957 --> 01:28:15,118
We anticipate a smooth trip
to the Hawaiian islands,

2147
01:28:15,192 --> 01:28:17,126
and we appreciate you flying
with us here

2148
01:28:17,194 --> 01:28:18,957
on Christmas Eve. Ho, Ho, Ho.

2149
01:28:19,063 --> 01:28:21,463
Sit back, relax
and enjoy your trip.

2150
01:28:21,532 --> 01:28:22,624
So,

2151
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,635
did you want coffee,
tea... or me?

2152
01:28:26,937 --> 01:28:28,336
Oh, Brittany, you are wicked.

2153
01:28:28,406 --> 01:28:29,930
Mr. Roberts can't join
the mile-high club.

2154
01:28:30,007 --> 01:28:30,939
We're still on the ground.

2155
01:28:31,008 --> 01:28:31,975
Thanks anyway, ladies.

2156
01:28:32,043 --> 01:28:33,510
I'm just going
to study my lines.

2157
01:28:33,577 --> 01:28:35,875
Oh yeah, we heard about
the movie and the director.

2158
01:28:35,946 --> 01:28:36,935
You're a huge star.

2159
01:28:37,014 --> 01:28:38,982
So tell us--
what's the movie about?

2160
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,312
-We are huge fans.
-Huge.

2161
01:28:40,384 --> 01:28:41,976
Huge. Seriously huge fans.

2162
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:43,108
-Sick.
-We love your work.

2163
01:28:43,187 --> 01:28:44,279
I mean, but normal.

2164
01:28:44,355 --> 01:28:45,549
Totally normal.

2165
01:28:45,623 --> 01:28:46,988
It's about this guy, Mr. Blake.

2166
01:28:47,091 --> 01:28:49,491
And in the movie, he wants
to build the biggest house

2167
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,993
in the whole world,
because he thinks

2168
01:28:51,095 --> 01:28:52,392
it will make him happy,
but it doesn't.

2169
01:28:52,463 --> 01:28:53,395
It doesn't?

2170
01:28:53,464 --> 01:28:55,091
Big houses make me horny.

2171
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,292
Me, too.

2172
01:28:56,367 --> 01:28:58,130
Well, he used
to think the same way,

2173
01:28:58,202 --> 01:28:59,499
but then he falls in love.

2174
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:00,696
Is she a flight attendant?

2175
01:29:00,771 --> 01:29:02,500
Does she get to live
in that big house?

2176
01:29:02,573 --> 01:29:03,870
'Cause I met this producer...

2177
01:29:03,941 --> 01:29:05,602
No, no, no. Listen, listen.

2178
01:29:05,676 --> 01:29:08,645
He finds love, and he realizes
that love is everything.

2179
01:29:08,713 --> 01:29:10,647
Not the biggest house
in the world,

2180
01:29:10,715 --> 01:29:12,649
not being a billionaire.

2181
01:29:12,717 --> 01:29:15,584
He finds out what he wanted
wasn't what he needed,

2182
01:29:15,653 --> 01:29:18,679
and what he needed was
in his own backyard.

2183
01:29:20,891 --> 01:29:24,759
It was right there
in his own backyard.

2184
01:29:30,501 --> 01:29:31,433
I didn't have the money

2185
01:29:31,502 --> 01:29:32,833
for real presents
this year, okay?

2186
01:29:32,903 --> 01:29:34,962
So, Sam, if what I got you is
not what you really wanted,

2187
01:29:35,072 --> 01:29:36,562
or you're disappointed,
we can return it.

2188
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,608
And Sally, the same goes
for you, all right?

2189
01:29:38,676 --> 01:29:39,938
Whoa.

2190
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:42,979
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

2191
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,377
Where did all this come from?

2192
01:29:46,884 --> 01:29:47,873
Dickie!

2193
01:29:47,952 --> 01:29:48,941
Dickie, you're here.

2194
01:29:49,019 --> 01:29:51,510
What are you doing here?

2195
01:29:51,589 --> 01:29:52,521
I can't believe it.

2196
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:53,579
-Hey.
-Merry Christmas.

2197
01:29:53,657 --> 01:29:55,284
Dickie, what
about your movie?

2198
01:29:55,359 --> 01:29:57,691
Well, sometimes in Hollywood
if you say no,

2199
01:29:57,762 --> 01:29:59,559
it only makes them
want you more.

2200
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:01,689
So you're staying, Dickie?

2201
01:30:01,766 --> 01:30:03,791
If your Mom's okay with it,
I'd like room and board

2202
01:30:03,868 --> 01:30:05,233
for quite a while.

2203
01:30:09,006 --> 01:30:11,304
Oh.

2204
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:13,866
Okay!

2205
01:30:13,944 --> 01:30:16,378
And so Dickie Roberts'
dreams did come true,

2206
01:30:16,447 --> 01:30:18,381
but in a way he never
could have imagined.

2207
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:21,976
He created a sitcom
based on his exploits,

2208
01:30:22,052 --> 01:30:23,986
and, with Leif Garrett starring
as the Dickie character,

2209
01:30:24,054 --> 01:30:26,113
the show quickly climbed
into the top ten,

2210
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:27,623
winning four Emmys.

2211
01:30:27,691 --> 01:30:29,955
Here's Dickie and his agent,
Sidney Wernick.

2212
01:30:30,027 --> 01:30:31,722
I may have to pee
every 45 minutes,

2213
01:30:31,796 --> 01:30:33,923
but at least I get to pee
in a gold toilet.

2214
01:30:33,998 --> 01:30:35,488
Dickie didn't forget
his friends,

2215
01:30:35,566 --> 01:30:38,660
and they enjoy a weekly spot
on the popular sitcom.

2216
01:30:38,736 --> 01:30:40,601
With Grace in charge
of set design,

2217
01:30:40,671 --> 01:30:41,899
Sam writing jokes,

2218
01:30:41,972 --> 01:30:44,566
and Sally becoming the youngest
choreographer in TV,

2219
01:30:44,642 --> 01:30:47,236
Dickie keeps the show
a real family affair.

2220
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:49,506
Brick wall, waterfall,
Danny thinks

2221
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,047
he's got it all, but he don't.

2222
01:30:51,148 --> 01:30:52,240
And we do.

2223
01:30:52,316 --> 01:30:53,544
So boom with that attitude.

2224
01:30:53,617 --> 01:30:55,016
A Reese's Pieces, 7 UP.

2225
01:30:55,085 --> 01:30:56,746
Mess with us, we mess you up.

2226
01:30:56,821 --> 01:30:58,448
And cut. So good.

2227
01:31:01,192 --> 01:31:04,161
They're driving me crazy.

2228
01:31:04,228 --> 01:31:05,320
As for George and Cyndi,

2229
01:31:05,396 --> 01:31:07,387
their ill-fated romance
didn't quite work out.

2230
01:31:07,465 --> 01:31:10,366
Would you make yourself useful
and get me a drink?

2231
01:31:14,171 --> 01:31:15,798
How about some champagne?

2232
01:31:15,873 --> 01:31:16,805
Whatever.

2233
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:22,843
The bottle impact led
to a case of walking amnesia,

2234
01:31:22,913 --> 01:31:25,177
and George was last seen
hitchhiking into the desert

2235
01:31:25,249 --> 01:31:26,477
to find himself.

2236
01:31:30,855 --> 01:31:34,256
Cyndi, soon after,
begged Dickie for a job.

2237
01:31:34,325 --> 01:31:36,384
He gave her a guest part
on his show,

2238
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,724
on the episode titled
"Cyndi Gets Poison Oak."

2239
01:31:40,731 --> 01:31:43,291
Its success led to a spin-off
for Cyndi called,

2240
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:46,200
The Bitch Who Didn't Know
She Was a Bitch.

2241
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:48,738
As for Dickie Roberts,
millions of Americans tuned in

2242
01:31:48,806 --> 01:31:50,535
to the sitcom's wedding show

2243
01:31:50,608 --> 01:31:53,372
which reflected Dickie's
real-life marriage

2244
01:31:53,444 --> 01:31:55,378
to the love of his life, Grace.

2245
01:31:55,446 --> 01:31:56,811
The old saying goes,

2246
01:31:56,881 --> 01:31:58,906
"There's no business
like show business,"

2247
01:31:58,983 --> 01:32:01,850
but as the incredible saga
of "Dickie Roberts,

2248
01:32:01,919 --> 01:32:04,945
Former Child Star," shows us,
the more apt saying is,

2249
01:32:05,022 --> 01:32:07,183
"There's no love
like real love."

2250
01:32:07,258 --> 01:32:09,783
This has been the story
of Dickie Roberts:

2251
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:11,760
The E! True Hollywood Story..

2252
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:31,004
Former child stars
are people, too

2253
01:32:31,115 --> 01:32:36,815
They're the same as you,
and you and you

2254
01:32:36,887 --> 01:32:40,288
So we ask
this simple question

2255
01:32:40,357 --> 01:32:45,021
How can it be
that you occasionally

2256
01:32:45,129 --> 01:32:48,462
Don't respect their dignity?

2257
01:32:48,532 --> 01:32:52,127
'Cause as they make their way
through life

2258
01:32:52,202 --> 01:32:55,194
Long after
the spotlight's faded

2259
01:32:55,272 --> 01:32:57,536
There are things
some of you do

2260
01:32:57,608 --> 01:33:01,704
That make them want
to be sedated

2261
01:33:01,779 --> 01:33:04,213
We loved being child stars

2262
01:33:04,281 --> 01:33:07,682
On your television

2263
01:33:07,751 --> 01:33:09,582
But please stop giving us crap

2264
01:33:09,653 --> 01:33:14,681
Or we'll have
a head-on collision

2265
01:33:14,758 --> 01:33:20,663
Thank you for letting me
in your living rooms

2266
01:33:20,731 --> 01:33:25,930
To entertain you before bed

2267
01:33:26,003 --> 01:33:30,531
But if one more person
calls me Marcia

2268
01:33:30,608 --> 01:33:33,805
I'll bust his fucking head

2269
01:33:33,877 --> 01:33:38,940
She's very grateful,
just like she said

2270
01:33:39,016 --> 01:33:42,008
But please don't call her Marcia

2271
01:33:42,152 --> 01:33:44,780
Or she'll bust
your freaking head

2272
01:33:44,855 --> 01:33:47,346
Yeah, I'd rather be called
Marcia then Screech.

2273
01:33:47,424 --> 01:33:53,021
So I'm sitting alone
in Arby's

2274
01:33:53,097 --> 01:33:58,125
I get questions
that make me see red

2275
01:33:58,202 --> 01:33:59,464
Hey, Eddie?

2276
01:33:59,536 --> 01:34:01,561
Where's Herman Munster?

2277
01:34:01,639 --> 01:34:04,972
Well, pal, for ten years,
he's been dead

2278
01:34:05,075 --> 01:34:07,236
They ask, "Hey, Lucy,
where's J.R.?"

2279
01:34:07,311 --> 01:34:09,108
Come on, y'all, be realistic.

2280
01:34:09,179 --> 01:34:11,113
One more "Hey, Joanie,
where's Chachi,"

2281
01:34:11,181 --> 01:34:12,375
and I'll go ballistic.

2282
01:34:12,449 --> 01:34:15,316
Our costars
are not on our speed dial

2283
01:34:15,386 --> 01:34:17,149
So please don't ask

2284
01:34:17,221 --> 01:34:20,213
Or we'll take that phone
and shove it

2285
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:24,488
Right up your dumb fat ass

2286
01:34:24,561 --> 01:34:27,086
No, we don't ride
in fancy limos

2287
01:34:27,164 --> 01:34:30,395
Private jets,
they're not for us

2288
01:34:30,467 --> 01:34:33,334
So you may see us driving Neons

2289
01:34:33,404 --> 01:34:35,998
Or riding the Greyhound bus

2290
01:34:36,106 --> 01:34:39,269
Yeah, we live
just like all of you

2291
01:34:39,343 --> 01:34:41,971
So don't call us losers

2292
01:34:42,046 --> 01:34:44,310
Or we'll punch you
with so many rights

2293
01:34:44,381 --> 01:34:46,781
You'll be begging for lefts

2294
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:51,048
And beggars
can't be choosers

2295
01:35:02,599 --> 01:35:07,730
I was on Teen Beat
with Michael Jackson

2296
01:35:07,805 --> 01:35:11,571
Now he's bigger, I suppose

2297
01:35:11,642 --> 01:35:13,576
Yeah, yeah

2298
01:35:13,644 --> 01:35:17,512
Though he may be
a multi-zillionaire

2299
01:35:17,581 --> 01:35:20,948
At least I still have my nose

2300
01:35:21,018 --> 01:35:23,077
At least we're not crazy

2301
01:35:23,153 --> 01:35:25,986
We don't sleep with chimpanzees

2302
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:28,615
We don't bleach our skin

2303
01:35:28,692 --> 01:35:31,286
Or dangle babies from balconies

2304
01:35:31,361 --> 01:35:36,958
We loved being child stars
on your television

2305
01:35:37,034 --> 01:35:39,366
But misbehave and
we'll bust your head

2306
01:35:39,436 --> 01:35:41,631
Gee, Wally,
was it something they said?

2307
01:35:41,705 --> 01:35:45,766
Child stars
on your television

2308
01:35:45,843 --> 01:35:47,674
Most of us have nothing
to lose

2309
01:35:47,745 --> 01:35:50,407
So we'll put your butt
on the 5:00 news

2310
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:54,315
Child stars
on your television

2311
01:35:54,384 --> 01:35:56,443
We don't know karate,
but we do know crazy

2312
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,954
We'll beat you so bad,
your future will be hazy

2313
01:35:59,022 --> 01:36:02,890
Child stars
on your television

2314
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,951
Don't ever say,
"Didn't you used to be...?"

2315
01:36:05,028 --> 01:36:07,553
Or I'll put your head
through a vintage TV

2316
01:36:07,631 --> 01:36:11,397
Child stars on your television

2317
01:36:11,468 --> 01:36:13,459
Eight rehabs isn't enough

2318
01:36:13,537 --> 01:36:16,062
But I've done and seen
the most killer stuff

2319
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:19,974
Child stars
on your television

2320
01:36:20,043 --> 01:36:22,068
You want an autograph
but I'ma tell you this

2321
01:36:22,146 --> 01:36:24,512
Don't ask a brother
when he's taking a piss

2322
01:36:24,581 --> 01:36:28,483
Child stars
on your television

2323
01:36:28,552 --> 01:36:30,679
You can dance like me,
you can dance like Mickey

2324
01:36:30,754 --> 01:36:34,656
I'll hurt you real bad,
you can take it from Kenickie

2325
01:36:34,725 --> 01:36:37,285
Now of course
we've been kidding

2326
01:36:37,361 --> 01:36:39,522
This has all been in fun

2327
01:36:39,596 --> 01:36:46,001
We're happy you still love us,
after our shows have gone

2328
01:36:46,103 --> 01:36:50,005
But please just follow
our simple rules

2329
01:36:50,073 --> 01:36:52,303
Or we'll beat you
like rented mules.

2330
01:36:55,279 --> 01:37:00,774
We loved being child stars
on your television

2331
01:37:00,851 --> 01:37:04,947
Child stars

2332
01:37:05,055 --> 01:37:05,953
Child stars.

2333
01:37:47,164 --> 01:37:49,325
All right you guys,
thanks for coming.

2334
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:50,457
Let's skedoodle.

2335
01:37:50,534 --> 01:37:52,092
All right,
that's seriously the end.

2336
01:37:52,169 --> 01:37:53,363
People in the back, beat it.

2337
01:37:53,437 --> 01:37:54,734
We know you left your popcorn.

2338
01:37:54,805 --> 01:37:56,238
That's fine.
Someone will get it.

2339
01:37:56,306 --> 01:37:58,570
And quit pretending like
you're reading the credits.

2340
01:37:58,642 --> 01:37:59,574
They're so small,

2341
01:37:59,643 --> 01:38:01,110
and we're pushing them by
so fast.

2342
01:38:01,178 --> 01:38:02,941
We don't even know
who these people are.

2343
01:38:03,046 --> 01:38:04,138
It's some contract thing.

2344
01:38:05,315 --> 01:38:06,304
Who was that?

2345
01:38:06,383 --> 01:38:08,146
Was that one of you guys,
or was that me?

2346
01:38:08,218 --> 01:38:09,276
That was me.

2347
01:38:09,353 --> 01:38:10,615
Got a little bite in it.

2348
01:38:10,687 --> 01:38:13,155
Come on, that's funny.
