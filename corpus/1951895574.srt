00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,039
Well, that'll be fine.

329
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,399
-A pleasure, Mr Rutherford.
-Carter, Miss Littleton.

330
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,159
-Say, CC...
-There you are.

332
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,079
Could you bring the car around?
We're ready to leave.

333
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,479
-l don't think this gentleman works here.
-No?

334
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,839
He certainly looks like the retrieving type.

336
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,160
-Do you work here, Dodge?
-No, CC, l came to talk to you.

337
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Yes, well, l'm afraid we're going to dinner.
Come, let's find a real valet, shall we?

338
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,320
L have $20,000
that says you might want to talk.

339
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,479
So if l understand you correctly,
Mr Connelly,

340
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,480
it's your intention
to legitimise professional football?

341
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,519
-That's right.
-Well, let me say straight off,

342
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,039
there's no such beast
as professional football.

343
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,040
There's only miners and farmers and
shell-shocked veterans of the Great War,

344
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
smashing each other's skulls together

345
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,800
in a million turnip fields
from Duluth to East Jesus.

346
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Now l ask you,
how do you intend to legitimise that?

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,399
By keeping it alive, by investing in a team.

348
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Well, you see, there's the catch.
l'm not interested in investing.

349
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,880
L'm more of a 20-percenter.
New talent, new ideas interest me.

350
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,239
Professional football
does not attract new talent,

351
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,240
and investing in a professional
football team is not a new idea.

352
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,759
Dodge,

353
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,559
we had some laughs a few years ago.

354
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,560
-You had some laughs.
-(CHUCKLlNG) Yes.

355
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Yes, l guess l did.

356
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,280
-So...
-Okay.

357
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,399
How about this for a new idea?

358
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,199
Carter Rutherford leaves Princeton
to play for the Duluth Bulldogs.

359
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,959
-What?
-Hear me out.

360
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,879
Carter, you're a pretty remarkable guy,
aren't you?

361
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,919
-l just play football.
-You don't have to be modest with me.

362
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,079
L know your story.

363
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,080
How you put your education on hold
to serve your country, to fight in the war.

364
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,559
L was just doing what l thought was right.

365
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,239
DODGE: The President
gave you a medal for bravery.

366
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,319
CARTER: l was just in
the right place at the right time.

367
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,320
That's not what the papers said.
They called you the hero of the Argonne.

368
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,519
Then, when you went back to school,
you turned out to be a football hero, too.

369
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,959
-Mr Connelly, l'm just a guy...
-Carter.

370
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,439
Do kids chase you down the hallway
at school?

371
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,519
Sometimes.

372
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,479
Follow you around?
Ask you for an autograph?

373
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,199
Lt happens, yeah,
but you can't take that stuff too seriously.

374
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
You feel like sometimes
everybody wants something from you?

375
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,400
And how are you compensated for living
your life under that kind of public scrutiny?

376
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,120
By paying tuition to Princeton.

377
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Let me ask you a question.
Do you like playing football?

378
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,359
L love playing football.

379
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Good. You got one more year and that's it.
That's all she wrote.

380
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,359
What are you gonna do then?

381
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,519
Actually, l've already been accepted
to Yale Law School.

382
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,519
L have a position waiting for me
at Hager, Danes and Upton

383
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,159
when l get my law degree.

384
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Lt turns out, l'm not too bad a student,
when l put my mind to it.

385
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,760
You... That's good. lt's good.

386
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,520
And all of that will be waiting for you,
no question about it.

387
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,399
But the world's full of good lawyers.

388
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,799
Ln football,
there's only one Carter Rutherford.

389
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,800
You don't need any more teaching
to be what you are out on the field.

390
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,920
You ought to be playing football, and
you ought to be rewarded for your talent.

391
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,239
Makes sense. Sort of.

392
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,999
So did bloodletting at the time.

393
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
CC: You're very passionate, Mr Connelly.
What exactly do you have in mind?

394
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Carter Rutherford takes a temporary leave
from Princeton to play for Duluth,

395
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,160
and in exchange
he is guaranteed $5,000 a game.

396
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,479
Let's you and l have another drink,
Mr Connelly.

397
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,879

398
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,399
Why don't you two run along,
conduct your interview,

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400

thrash out your future?

400
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Come on, Carter.

401
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,159
Carter Rutherford wouldn't sit on a bench
for that kind of money.

402
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,759
Did l say 5? l meant 10.

403
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,399
L assume you'll be paying this
out of the gate receipts?

404
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,199
-That's right.
-Of course, l'll want it in the form

405
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,999
of a guarantee.
Plus l get a percentage of the overages.

406
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,319
Of course. ln the neighbourhood of 5%.

407
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,959
L was thinking a little more uptown.

408
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,960
-10?
-25.

409
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,120
L'll understand if you decline.
Most teams would.

410
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,440

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,720
(LAUGHS) Well, then all is forgiven.

655
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Yes, it is.

656
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,640
Why don't you like to talk
about the Argonne?

657
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,480
-Who's asking?
-Just me.

658
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,039
Stories get bigger over time.

659
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,040
-You never went to France.
-No, not that big.

660
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Everything they say happened, happened.

661
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Lt's just that the telling of it gets
a little better.

662
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,280
How much better?

663
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,560
We were pinned down in a gully.

664
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,760
We were there about three days, l guess.

665
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Lt had been raining for about a week.

666
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,159
So some of the fellas and l,

667
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,160
we hunkered down in a foxhole,
and wejust waited for the weather to break.

668
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,920
A writer from The Times was with us.

669
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,080
Now' you know I never drink'
but it was so cold and so wet.

670
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,159
(CHUCKLES) I started to
take a few slugs off a flask.

671
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,559
Easy there, Carter.
That stuff will melt your teeth.

672
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,799
Ja! Sehr gut.

673
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,800
-Tell me again. Ich gebe surrender?
-Auf.

674
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,360
Ich gebe auf. lf you have no way out,
you lay down your rifle

675
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,560
and yell, "Ich gebe auf, "
otherwise they'll shoot you.

676
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,359
Ich gebe auf!

677
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,360
We were nearly out of ammo,
we were down to about nine fellas,

678
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,959
and we had this plan
that we were gonna speak enough German

679
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,960
to get us out of there.
Take our chances in a war camp.

680
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,800
All through the night the fighting continued,
until we were all out of ammo.

681
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Sitting ducks.
And we had been up for 36 hours.

682
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,839
That' and the drinking...

683
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,479
JACK: Okay, fellas,
we ain't taking this spot any time soon.

684
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,480
So let's call it a night and try again.

685
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,879
CARTER: I don't know how long I was there.

686
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,279
But it had to have been a few hours,

687
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,039
because by that time,
the Jerries had taken the foxhole.

688
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,839
But I was so covered up, they never saw me.

689
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,279
And I never saw them.

so theyjust dropped their weapons.

696
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,600
Theyjust gave up.

that I started to have a really bad feeling.

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,199
CARTER: When it was all sorted out'

701
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,119
The Lieutenant thought it was best
if we alljust kept our mouths shut.

We were stuck.

708
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,720
That's a lot of responsibility
for a young man.

There's this one joint off of Halstead
that's at the bottom of a meat locker.

Hey, Mikey. And you have to walk
through all this meat,
