..wildfire.

845
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:33,106
DARIUS: So, what did you do
when the lead went dead?

846
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:35,073
POOLE: We asked more questions.

847
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:38,306
What was Suge Knight's demeanour

848
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:41,140
when you interviewed him
after the shooting?

849
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:45,840
Um, elusive. He didn't help us.

850
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:47,271
Nobody did.

851
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:51,272
Truth be told, Vegas doesn't
want us to close the Tupac case.

852
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:55,140
Move the cars, open the bars,
keep the Strip open.

853
00:43:55,172 --> 00:43:59,206
Leave those circus trials
in L.A., you know what I mean?

854
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,605
How's that?

855
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,905
- You saw our murder book, right?
- Yeah.

856
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:05,573
Every page is a sworn statement
by an eyewitness

857
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:09,139
that contradicts another sworn
statement by an eyewitness.

858
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:11,005
You take a suspect to trial,

859
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:12,706
his attorney
will have a field day

860
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:14,673
and we'll be left
holding our dicks.

861
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:17,338
Like those LAPD dicks
after the OJ trial.

862
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:18,772
You know what?

863
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:22,205
- Go fuck yourself.
- (CHUCKLES) Come again?

864
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,072

you fuckin' heard me.

00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:27,805
(LAUGHS) Are you serious?

866
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,006
Those LAPD dicks
got royally fucked

867
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:32,639
because they had the audacity

868
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,171
to pin the murder
on a guilty man,

869
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,039
a man lucky enough to be charged
after Rodney King,

870
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:39,506
so Cochran could just hint
that they were racist.

871
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:41,906
Everybody heard
the Furhman tape.

872
00:44:41,938 --> 00:44:43,905
I'm talking about solid guys,
lifetime fuckin' guys,

873
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:45,406
who had their retirement
fuckin' ruined.

874
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,973
Why? Because they had the balls
to do their fuckin' job!

875
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:50,472
And here you are,
you gutless fuckin' wonder!

876
00:44:50,505 --> 00:44:52,006
We'll talk about cops.

877
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:53,973
You will never in your career

878
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:58,272
do the cop work they did
on a fuckin' lunch break.

879
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:00,939
One more thing.

880
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:04,639
Fuck Fuhrman.
You remind me of him.

881
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:07,039
And fuck this fuckin' city.

882
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:15,072
Miserable piece of fuckin' shit.

883
00:45:15,105 --> 00:45:18,072
MILLER: You idolise guys
ahead of you in the force.

884
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:20,973
Then you watch them get fucked

885
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:23,738
by the very system
they propped up.

886
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:26,039
It's a game of inches.
The point is to win.

887
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,840
So us, we stick together.

888
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:32,071
And we do everything we have to
to win.

889
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,006
Hmm?

890
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:42,272
The FBI have infiltrated
Death Row.

891
00:45:42,304 --> 00:45:45,171
There are LAPD officers
in its inner circle

892
00:45:45,205 --> 00:45:48,973
and these officers
are loyal to Suge Knight.

893
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:55,406
I believe that Officer Gaines
may have been an accessory

894
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:57,806
to Biggie Smalls's murder.

895
00:46:01,738 --> 00:46:04,138
MILLER: OK, Poole,
walk me through it.

896
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:08,271
12:30am,
Wallace exits the Petersen

897
00:46:08,305 --> 00:46:12,673
and gets in the last vehicle
of a three-car convoy.

898
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:17,305
It's a Suburban. It's driven
by Greg Young, aka G-Money.

899
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:18,638
Right.

900
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:20,773
In the first vehicle

901
00:46:20,806 --> 00:46:22,940
is an off-duty
Inglewood police officer,

902
00:46:22,972 --> 00:46:24,773
Reginald Blaylock.

903
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:30,972
He pulls out, blocks
the traffic on Fairfax, OK?

904
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:34,372
Now, Biggie's security,
Eugene Deal,

905
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:37,005
walks to the garage exit,

906
00:46:37,037 --> 00:46:38,805
where he comes face to face

907
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:41,506
with a man in a blue suit
and a bow tie,

908
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:44,306
who Deal identifies as a member
of the Fruit of Islam.

909
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:46,805
- The Nation of Islam's...
- Security guards.

910
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:48,605
Yeah, exactly.

911
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,506
Deal shows the man
that he's armed.

912
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:52,538
The man leaves.

913
00:46:52,571 --> 00:46:55,805
Deal then notices,
as do many other eyewitnesses,

914
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:01,271
a black sedan parked
facing southbound on Fairfax.

915
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:02,773
- Correct?
- Yeah.

916
00:47:02,806 --> 00:47:05,239
And it's in front
of a white vehicle,

917
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:10,472
the occupants of which shoot
video of the incident, OK?

918
00:47:10,504 --> 00:47:13,538
Deal then gets in the second car
of the convoy.

919
00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:16,505
Excuse me.
Kenneth Story is driving.

920
00:47:18,404 --> 00:47:19,939
Puffy is sitting

921
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:23,772
in the passenger seat.

922
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:26,573
Then they pull
just past the kerb.

923
00:47:26,606 --> 00:47:30,739
Biggie's SUV
then pulls in behind.

924
00:47:30,772 --> 00:47:32,172
OK?

925
00:47:32,205 --> 00:47:34,906
On the sidewalk
are approximately 15 people

926
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:37,171
who had attended the party
at the Petersen.

927
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:40,338
DJ Quik, Kurupt
and, er, what's that...

928
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:42,405
- Wait, Foxy Brown.
- Foxy Brown, here.

929
00:47:42,438 --> 00:47:46,773
Now, while Biggie's car idles
at the exit of the garage,

930
00:47:46,805 --> 00:47:49,138
he signs an autograph for a fan

931
00:47:49,172 --> 00:47:52,172
and then he speaks to a woman
who approaches the vehicle.

932
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:55,573
Now, 12:49am.

933
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,606
Puffy's car pulls out,

934
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:00,439
heads north on Fairfax.

935
00:48:00,472 --> 00:48:04,039
Eugene Deal,
Wallace's head of security...

936
00:48:04,072 --> 00:48:04,905
Security.

937
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:06,406
..he advises Kenneth Story,

938
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:09,072
blow the light,
for security reasons, OK?

939
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:11,806
Puffy's car goes through
that yellow light

940
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:13,104
and turns left onto Wilshire.

941
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:17,638
But Biggie's car
stops at the red light.

942
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:19,138
That lane, exactly.

943
00:48:19,171 --> 00:48:24,338
The second he stops at
this red light, a white SUV...

944
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:29,971
..pulls in parallel
to Biggie's vehicle

945
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:31,672
and stops, blocking it.

946
00:48:31,706 --> 00:48:35,171
Now, at this exact same second,

947
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:38,904
our shooter,
in the black sedan...

948
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:40,639
- MILLER: The Chevy Impala SS.
- Yes.

949
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:43,605
He speeds north on Fairfax,

950
00:48:43,638 --> 00:48:47,271
pulling parallel to the right
side of Biggie's car...

951
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:49,705
- (TYRES SCREECH)
- ..boxing him in...

952
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:51,639

953
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:55,104
..while the shooter
fires six shots.

954
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:56,872
We checked the cellphone data.

955
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:58,773
It's garbage.
We can't use any of it.

956
00:48:58,806 --> 00:49:02,005
So, look, either the shooter
got lucky

957
00:49:02,037 --> 00:49:07,139
or, I don't know, he coordinated
it in some other way.

958
00:49:07,937 --> 00:49:12,138
If Officer Gaines
or other cops advised,

959
00:49:12,172 --> 00:49:14,639
they would know
to avoid cells, obviously.

960
00:49:14,672 --> 00:49:16,139
Yeah.

961
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:18,239
You know what
they'd use, Miller?

962
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:21,038
Walkie-talkies.

963
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:24,138
Miller, he bought
into your theory

964
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:26,438
that LAPD cops were involved?

965
00:49:27,472 --> 00:49:29,406
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

I saw clues that said

Miller only saw that we were

Oh, er... protecting his pension.

00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:09,071
Everybody in the LAPD
knew that Gaines was dirty.

1001

But as soon as Cochran
was in his family's corner...

flew to New York without me.

that my cop theory's a dead end.

Ask him to slip you the

1184
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:58,838
You said murder book,
as in uno,

1185
01:02:58,872 --> 01:03:02,638
not 40 boxes of 90 murder books.

Right.

1191

But news, that's something that
somebody wants to suppress.

1192

1193

Alright, this is off the record.

1255
01:06:21,204 --> 01:06:25,838
I bet you Poole
hasn't mentioned Wardell Fouse.

He was a Mob Piru Blood

- I'll track him down.
- And bring along a shovel.

1266

on his sleeve,

1267
01:06:55,204 --> 01:06:58,105
ask him about his suspension.

was based upon his theory
and it was all tossed.

1272

The man is a lonely shut-in.

1273
01:07:11,471 --> 01:07:14,970
And he needs a warm body
like yourself to talk to.

1274
01:07:15,003 --> 01:07:17,103
So he'll say
whatever you want to hear.

But reporting things
that aren't true

1276
