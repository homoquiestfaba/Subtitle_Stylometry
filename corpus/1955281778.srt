1
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,666
Is this the decision?

2
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,102
It is.

3
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:38,639
Can you pay the price?

4
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,649
All of it.

5
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:52,386
The beast requires flesh
to become flesh.

6
00:00:57,091 --> 00:01:01,129
Your blood
will be his price.

7
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,163
Revenge.

8
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:42,536
A worthy cause,
but at a great price.

9
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,773
No. Ha!

10
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,310
I need you more.

11
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:53,414
I need to come back
in style.

12
00:01:55,783 --> 00:02:00,154
I need...

13
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,290
a posse.

14
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:06,360
Who will be

15
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,429
my new playthings?

16
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:14,202
A little piece
of behemoth.

17
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,743
[raspy breathing]

18
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,922
I dub thee Punchy.
[laughing]

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,392
I didn't want all this.
I wanted just one. You.

20
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,263
What? More than
you bargained for?

21
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,833
Consider it a bonus, bozo.

22
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:51,272
You, Gemini.

23
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,407
Freak Show.

24
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,660
Ahh, succubus.

25
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:20,434
Batty Boop.

26
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,553
I always wanted
a girlfriend.

27
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:52,333
What? Where did he go?

28
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,468
Who is to be my victim?

29
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:59,039
No. What's happening?

30
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:04,011
I guess we're going
home, schnookums. Oops!

31
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,915
I don't want to go.
I want to kill.

32
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,719
[clown screaming]

33
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,341
Okay, everybody,
listen up. Party's over.
Move out, come on.

34
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,978
Now, let's go.
People, move it.

35
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,047
See you later.

36
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:33,453
Be careful.

37
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:38,091
I am so sorry, Officer,
everything just
got out of hand.

38
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,494
And, um...

39
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:45,098
Do you live here?
No, but I'm house sitting
for my professor.

40
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:49,870
And he's out of town.

41
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,841
Okay, keep it
down, please.

42
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,176
Yes, Officer.
One warning, that's it.

43
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,245
Okay, thank you.

44
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:05,485
Good night.
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you.

45
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,020
Good job, baby.

46
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,022
God, what the hell?

47
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,593
Looks like your little
shindig got out of hand,
huh?

48
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,962
This has been
a fucking great party.

49
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:19,967
Best spring break ever, right?

50
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,004
If it wasn't
for the swine flu,

51
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,841
Whose idea was it
to invite half the campus?

52
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:34,281
I said only a few people.

53
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,416
You guys have got to
help me clean this place up

54
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,885
before the Professor
gets back.

55
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,920
Sandie, come on, you know?

56
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,489
You know we're gonna help
you clean up. I mean, look.

57
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,925
Whoa, Erica! Erica!

58
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,695
Let me just
get the bottles.
Sorry, okay.

59
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,097
I'll get the bottles.
You get the paper.

60
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:54,668
[Man] Baby, it's gonna
be okay. We'll help you
clean up this godforsaken.

61
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:57,137
OSHA-condemned
disaster zone up.

62
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,307
Stop trying
to make me feel better.

63
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,144
I caught these two
making out in the closet.

64
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,848
Get out.
[Erica] Awww.

65
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:11,785
Awww, that's so romantic.

66
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,025
Yeah, I think that's
romantic, too...

67
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:22,095
I do.
Zilla, you're so funny.

68
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,664
Dude, what's wrong
with you?

69
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,465
Look, man,
I just get nervous, all right?

70
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,035
Nervous?
You had the entire
night to talk to her.

71
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,970
I know,
but I'm kinda shy, man.

72
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:35,008
It takes me a while
to warm up to a girl.

73
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:41,514
You're on the Dean's List.
Girls line up for you, man.

74
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,350
I really like Erica.

75
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,648
Baby, baby, I gotta
get Zilla hooked up.

76
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:18,686
Zilla?
He's not a little boy.
He can do his own dirty work.

77
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:23,691
That's what I said,
but he really likes
your BFF.

78
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:27,661
He's been giving her
those puppy dog eyes
all night.

79
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,730
She didn't notice?

80
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:33,300
No, she responds
to audible speech
and other social cues.

81
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,870
Not smoke signals.

82
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,540
What the hell's
the matter with him?

83
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:45,012
He's shy, nervous.
He starts sweating,
fidgeting and stammering.

84
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,315
Hot flashes, cold flashes,
lukewarm flashes.

85
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,984
Then it's just
a total body meltdown.

86
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,120
Frankly, I think the reason
we call him Zilla

87
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,889
is because his breath's
a little stinky.

88
00:10:55,956 --> 00:11:01,194
What the hell happened
in his childhood?

89
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,564
Why does he follow you
around like a puppy dog?

90
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,834
'Cause I'm
the quarterback, baby.
The man with the plan.

91
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,436
He takes care of me
on the gridiron.

92
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,305
And I take care of him
in the real world.
He looks up to me.

93
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,641
Well, he's in trouble.

94
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,210
So are you.

95
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,952
[both gasping]

96
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,187
Sorry, Zilla.

97
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,890
It's fine, Erica.

98
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,292
Are you sleeping
here tonight?

99
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:37,164
Absolutely, I am.

100
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,599
I think I have a shirt
you can sleep in.

101
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,070
Don't worry about it, Sandie.
I sleep in the nude.

102
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,941
Well, look at that.
It's past my bedtime.

103
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:52,212
I guess I should get going.

104
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,481
I'll see you guys later.
Later.

105
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,951
Bye, Zilla. Thanks for helping
me clean up. You saved my butt.

106
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,987
You're way
too serious, baby.

107
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,922
It was a mistake
to have the party here.

108
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:05,092
The Professor gets back
in three days.

109
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,971
This is the last of it.
I finished the bedrooms.

110
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,406
Any puke up there?

111
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,374
Just in the bathrooms.

112
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,210
Thank God for linoleum.

113
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,913
I know. By the way,
where are the mirrors?

114
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,749
What?
I didn't see any mirrors.
Where'd you put them?

115
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,985
Come to think of it

116
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,889
there weren't any mirrors
in the house.

117
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,058
That's odd.

118
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,836
Coffee.

119
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,737
The paper.

120
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,105
I'll get the paper.

121
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,475
That's nice, dear.

122
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,900
What the hell is that?

123
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:24,804
I have no idea.
I just found it outside.

124
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,506
Somebody obviously
left it for us.

125
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,808
Rojer, I don't live here.

126
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,077
Just a house sitter.

127
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,945
Maybe it's
for the Professor.

128
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,847
Does it have
a note attached?

129
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:38,118
No, nothing.

130
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,521
I have no idea.
Let's open it.

131
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,024
We can't.
It's probably not for us.

132
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,794
You can't open mail
that's not yours.
Don't you know that?

133
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,897
This isn't mail.
Just some bag.

134
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,065
We're not gonna know
what's inside of it
unless we open it up.

135
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,201
So what do you suggest?

136
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,369
Erica and Zilla
are gonna be here tonight.

137
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,006
Yeah, baby, they will.
What are you thinking?

138
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,608
Maybe it was left
for one of them.

139
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,710
So you want to wait
till later to open it?

140
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:07,447
Yeah. We'll find out
what's in the bag
later tonight.

141
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,483
All right.

142
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:17,991
What is it?
We don't know.

143
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,093
Looks like a painting.

144
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,296
Maybe someone has
a secret admirer.

145
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,232
Let's open it.

146
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,400
No, you guys, this could
be for the Professor.

147
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,570
I don't see
his name on it.

148
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,206
Yeah, baby, how long
are we gonna wait?

149
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,975
It's probably
something perishable.

150
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,910
Perishable?
Like fruit.

151
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,947
I'm just impressed he used
a word with more than
three syllables.

152
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,350
Okay, children.
Cut it out.

153
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,354
Okay, fine,
let's open it.

154
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,124
Let's see what
the hell's inside.

155
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:06,940
[Rojer] I think someone
thought you needed a mirror.

156
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,577
Maybe they
thought the Professor
needed a mirror, Rojer.

157
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,346
It's beautiful.

158
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,882
So ornate.

159
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:29,762
It's probably an artifact,

160
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,432
Hey, Roj, check it out.
That's my favorite part here.

161
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,968
Don't worry, Sandie.
Nothing scary happens.
Just watch.

162
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,170
What about it?

163
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,241
[all gasp]

164
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,110
[Rojer] What the hell?

165
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,479
That's your
favorite part, man?

166
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:52,419
It's awesome, dudes!

167
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:56,990
Tomorrow night
the Professor's back.

168
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,591
Before back to the dorms.

169
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,194
One more night
to make a little trouble.

170
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,729
I'll drink to that.

171
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:17,210
Come on,
give me a picture, damn it!

172
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:21,181
[Batty Boop] Maybe you
need some bunny ears.

173
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:26,453
Yeah, well, Punchy
ate the last set.

174
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,289
And anyway,
aren't we digital yet?

175
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,624
Do you got the right
input selected?

176
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,861
I don't know.
I'm not an evil queen.

177
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,330
You're dressed like one.
Shut up!

178
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,900
Operation manual.

179
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:45,238
All right, fish breath,
come on, hand it over.

180
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,681
Here...

181
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,119
Chinese, I don't...

182
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:04,291
All right, fuck it.

183
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,846
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

184
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,383
who's the baddest
motherfucking clown
of all?

185
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,519
I'm talking
about Killjoy.

186
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,607
[mirror rattles]

187
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,744
[grunts]

188
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,342
Killjoy.

189
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,245
[Killjoy]
Well, you know my name!

190
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:44,851
Seems you have me at a bit
of a disadvantage, big boy.

191
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,185
What the hell?

192
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,589
It's Killjoy.
You already said that!

193
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,426
Now who the fuck are you?

194
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:56,963
Well, whatever your
name is...
Zilla.

195
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,668
Zilla. [Laughing]

196
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,736
As in God?

197
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,872
Zilla.

198
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,507
You're scary.

199
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:11,778
Now what are you
gonna do about it, big boy?

200
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,347
I'm gonna kick
your fucking ass, homey.

201
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,283
[laughs ]

202
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,586
Not "homey." Killjoy.

203
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,854
But don't you think
it would be better

204
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,557
if you picked on someone
your own size, huh?

205
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:30,963
Oh, Punchy!

206
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,650
Ooph! [Chuckles]

207
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:57,590
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
And it looks like
it's fight time!

208
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:01,093
In this corner,
hailing from who
the fuck cares

209
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:08,468
is a fucking dude named
after a Japanese monster.

210
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:14,474
But in this corner,
the unstoppable force,

211
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,378
the Babylonian behemoth.

212
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,748
Put your hands
in the air for Punchy,

213
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,318
the hobo clown!

214
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,625
All right,
come here you.
Come here you.

215
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:35,462
All right, I want
a nice clean fight.

216
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:38,264
Kinda like a I need
another asshole
in my other armpit.

217
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:43,370
Right?
[makes farting sounds]

218
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:48,274
No fish hooking,
no hitting below the belt.
[groans]

219
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:56,182
No rabbit punching.
[laughing]

220
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,385
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

221
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:03,089
Time to fight,
fight, fight, fight
fight, fight, fight, fight.

222
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,368
Oh!

223
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,692
[bell rings]

224
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,296
Back to your corner,
back to your corner.

225
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,799
[Killjoy] Come on.
Okay, okay.

226
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,902
Okay. [Groans]

227
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,740
That was great, kid.
You almost got this one.
I swear to God.

228
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,409
You just gotta stick
a move, stick a move,
all right?

229
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,877
Come on, come on.

230
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:01,180
Here, right here,
have a drink. No, wait!

231
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,951
You're supposed
to spit in this one.
Spit! Oh, yeah!

232
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,621
You got this.
Remember your namesake
Zilla, right?

233
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,823
Stick a move.
Work the body.

234
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,826
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

235
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,697
Up, up, up, go!
Come on.

236
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:34,714
[gibberish]

237
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,783
What the hell are you?

238
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,085
He's the unstoppable force!

239
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:44,423
[grunting]

240
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,043
[wincing]

241
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,846
No! Come on, Rojer.

242
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:13,920
[Zilla panting]

243
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:25,064
Hey, Zilla!

244
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,666
Zilla! Hey!

245
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,801
Hey, what...

246
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,737
No!
What's wrong?

247
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,775
No!

248
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:45,151
[Rojer] Zilla.
Help!

249
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,654
Sandie, get my phone.
It's on the table.

250
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:55,628
[Rojer] Call 911.

251
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,163
Hey, buddy.

252
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:03,169
[Man] What is your emergency?
My friend,
he's having a seizure.

253
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,837
Really?

254
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:07,139
He's getting the shit
beat out of him.

255
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,079
Send a fucking ambulance!

256
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,715
Okay, here it comes.

257
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,483
What the fuck!

258
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:22,689
Come on, buddy.
Hey, how are you?
Hey. Zilla.

259
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,691
He's coming to.

260
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,696
[laughs, stammers]

261
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,598
What? No.

262
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:34,667
Where the fuck did he go?

263
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,803
You should have
finished him off.

264
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,206
Uh-oh... [gibberish]

265
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,309
[screams]

266
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:49,515
I hate it
when they get away!

267
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,918
Don't worry, baby.

268
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,821
They ain't going nowhere.

269
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:59,491
Nowhere but here.

270
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,528
We got him.
He's coming to.

271
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,797
Hey, bud, we got you.
[panting]

272
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:08,768
Let's get him up.
Let's get him up.
I got you, come on.

273
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:11,938
Come on, get up.
Gotcha, bro. Here we go.

274
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,140
Here we go.
On the couch.

275
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:17,409
I can't beat him.
I can't beat him.
There you go.

276
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:20,647
He's a huge...
he's a huge...
Zilla, what happened?

277
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,649
Unstoppable force.
You all right, bud?

278
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,516
Big fucking boxing gloves.

279
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,920
What are you on?
Hey, Zilla, doesn't use
drugs, okay?

280
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:31,991
Big bodies.
It could be something else.

281
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,260
You all right, buddy?
Hey!

282
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,063
I don't know.
Zilla, what happened?

283
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,799
I don't know.
It was like a...

284
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,200
It was like a dream.

285
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,203
A really bad dream.

286
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,473
I saw Killjoy.
Killjoy.
No fucking way.

287
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,676
Who's Killjoy?
No one. Just a hallucination.

288
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,344
No.
What's with the ambulance?
Where's the phone?

289
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:56,415
The phones are dead.
What do you mean dead?
I thought you got through.

290
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,951
I don't think so.
The operator was...

291
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,954
Was what?
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

292
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,090
I'm gonna get the car.
I'm gonna be right back.

293
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,959
Take Zilla
to the hospital myself.

294
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:13,099
What the fuck?

295
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,434
What?

296
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,937
What's the problem?
I don't know.
I can't get out!

297
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,940
Something's blocking
the fucking door.

298
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:24,643
What?
Get back.

299
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:29,281
Next time, we've got
to get every bit
of him through.

300
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,318
I know, schnookums.

301
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,586
Don't worry.

302
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:39,759
He'll be back.
As long as he looks
in the mirror.

303
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:44,797
They'll all look.
They can't help it.

304
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:49,135
Why can't I just go
in there and kill them?
Booya!

305
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:53,105
Because if they die
in there,

306
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,908
we don't get to collect
their souls.

307
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:59,111
They've got to come to me.

308
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,413
[winces]

309
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,017
That clown was just
beating the hell out of me.

310
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,886
Then you guys pulled me
out of it.

311
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:08,354
You mean we woke you up.

312
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,024
No, I wasn't sleeping.

313
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,060
You pulled me out of it.

314
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,728
Zilla,
you were unconscious.

315
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,429
Then let him rest.

316
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,866
It's a little hard
to believe this shit.

317
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,400
Our phones
don't fucking work,

318
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,871
and we're trapped
inside this house, okay?

319
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,173
But something weird
is happening.

320
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:31,510
Come on, Sandie.
As you said,
let's let him rest.

321
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,913
All right, let's try
to get him up to one
of the beds

322
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,149
and then try and find
a way out of here.

323
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,889
Hey, Zilla, buddy,
come on. Here we go.

324
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,927
There we go. Come on,
Sandie, you lead him.
Okay.

325
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,932
I'll be up in a second.

326
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,067
I'm gonna
clean up the blood.

327
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,569
[Rojer]
All right.

328
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:00,907
Thataway, buddy,
thataway. Good job.

329
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,342
Good job.

330
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:16,348
Oh, my God.

331
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,986
You flatter me.

332
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,388
You can't be real.

333
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,291
Really?

334
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:28,227
What do you think
happened to your friend?

335
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:29,929
You think he cut
himself shaving?

336
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:32,064
Or fell down the stairs?

337
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,100
You're a demon
of vengeance.

338
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,168
What do you want
with us?

339
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,370
Who would want
vengeance on us?

340
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,874
Who indeed?

341
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:46,012
Vengeance is mine.

342
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,280
But I'm innocent.

343
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,581
Innocent?

344
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:58,024
Oh, yes, you must
be joking. [Laughs]

345
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,292
[gas hisses]

346
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,894
[groans]

347
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:06,565
Innocent.

348
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,101
That may be true.

349
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:14,006
You see, you're not really
the one that I want.

350
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,508
[laughs]

351
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:24,116
Your ass is mine!
[laughing]

352
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,524
You guys believe me,
right?

353
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,126
What do you mean?

354
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:38,430
That I saw him,
saw Killjoy.

355
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,934
Zilla, I think it's better
if you just get some rest.

356
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,004
Yeah, lay back.
We gotta figure out
what's going on here.

357
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,939
Then we're gonna deal
with it.

358
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,241
All right?
Just chill. Just relax.

359
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:53,445
What's going on?
What's going on?

360
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,281
Huh?
He's...

361
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:59,218
He's real.
Demon from hell.

362
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:01,487
Who?

363
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,589
He feeds for revenge.

364
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,424
Ten years ago.

365
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,926
What are you
talking about?

366
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:10,396
A decade ago
he was summoned.

367
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:13,165
Killed the boy
who summoned him.

368
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:16,302
He gets joy from death.

369
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,205
Guys...

370
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,407
stay away
from the mirror.

371
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,765
[grunts]

372
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:16,288
[no audible dialogue]

373
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,805
Erica.

374
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,179
Erica.

375
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,348
Erica, is that you?

376
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,842
[grunts]

377
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,513
What the fuck was that?

378
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,449
No, Zilla, stay down.
I'm fine, Sandie.

379
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:08,360
What the hell happened
to you, man?

380
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:09,995
I don't fucking know.

381
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,198
Thought I saw someone.
Who? Who'd you see?

382
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:17,903
I don't know. It was weird.

383
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,771
I turned around.
No one was there.

384
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,241
Maybe it was Erica.
It wasn't fucking Erica.

385
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:25,677
Where is Erica?

386
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,346
I don't know.
You guys haven't seen her?

387
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,548
No.

388
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:32,384
Erica.

389
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:35,387
Erica.

390
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,922
Erica?

391
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,659
Erica.

392
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,297
Erica.

393
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,201
Erica?

394
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,903
Sandie, don't touch it.

395
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,307
I think that's her.

396
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:57,643
Sounds like she's
in the mirror.

397
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,516
Erica.

398
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,453
Hello, kiddies.

399
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:11,490
Ahhh!

400
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:15,727
Doesn't she look delicious?

401
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,430
Holy shit,
fucking Killjoy.

402
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,632
You're damn right
it's Killjoy.

403
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,601
That's him, I guess.

404
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:27,839
[mocking]
That's him, I guess.

405
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,708
What have you done
with Erica?

406
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:32,744
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

407
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,414
I'll get to her
in a minute.

408
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:40,251
What do you want?

409
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,688
A feast, if you will.

410
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:46,625
So you're just going to
let us all enjoy

411
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:49,027
this scrumptious meal

412
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:52,063
by ourselves? Are you?

413
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,199
Oh! Oh!

414
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:58,169
[sniffs]
She smells delectable!

415
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:02,240
You better get away
from her or I'll...
You'll what?

416
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:05,010
When you decide
to join me,

417
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,946
you know where
the door is.

418
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,488
Do you think
they'll come?

419
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:20,291
They'll come.

420
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,094
But where is he,
our guest of honor?

421
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:27,399
[Batty Boop] Not to worry,
my painted prince.

422
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:30,769
Hi.

423
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:34,540
Cheer up.
Your friends will come.

424
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,375
And we'll all have a bite.

425
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:39,611
[gasps]

426
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:42,313
Puppy meat,
yum yum now?

427
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,115
Hold on there, tubby.

428
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:48,086
You'll have your chance.
Keep basting.

429
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,694
[groans]

430
00:39:55,761 --> 00:40:01,199
Where's the salt?

431
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,603
You're not seriously
suggesting...
You have a better idea?

432
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,372
You don't know what
we're up against.
I have a pretty good idea.

433
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:10,776
I'm gonna arm myself
any way I can. I suggest
you do the same,

434
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,344
especially if we're
gonna go after Erica.

435
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,681
Okay,
I guess you're right.

436
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,783
So we're going in.

437
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:21,352
We are going in, right?

438
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,688
Yes, we're going in,

439
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,423
but, Zilla,
you don't have to go.

440
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:27,959
I may be beat up,
but I'm bigger than
both of you put together.

441
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:31,697
You're gonna
need me in there.
Here it is.

442
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,832
I see your point.

443
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:36,401
All right,
what else repels demons?

444
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:39,638
[Rojer] I don't know.
Zilla, what do you think?

445
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:43,241
How the fuck
should I know? I'm not
a comic book character.

446
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,376
You were in there.
You had the most
contact with him.

447
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,379
They're the ones that
had all the contact,
with my face.

448
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,983
Easy, guys.
We have to think here.
What kills a demon?

449
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,385
What can we use
against them?

450
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,823
All right, maybe we oughta
slow down and think this
a little bit further.

451
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,991
Change up our strategy
a little bit.

452
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:03,562
What do you mean?
He's a clown, right?

453
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:05,931
Why are we afraid
of clowns?

454
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,133
'Cause they're fucking
stupid. How's this
gonna help us?

455
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,969
A lot of little kids
are afraid of clowns.

456
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,371
Yeah, why is that?
Where you going with this?

457
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,641
Because they do
horrible things
to each other,

458
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,644
and we're supposed
to laugh.

459
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,546
I'm not laughing
at Killjoy.

460
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:24,583
I get it.
That's the point.

461
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,918
What is?
Exactly.

462
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,587
He's a clown.

463
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,790
Maybe we're supposed
to laugh.

464
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:41,099
[Sandie] Don't shut the door!
What's the hell's
going on here?

465
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,768
Professor.

466
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,903
What are you kids doing?
The door's stuck.

467
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:48,774
We're trapped.
Trapped?

468
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,109
Sir, you wouldn't believe us
even if we told you.

469
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,679
Oh, my God.

470
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,614
Oh, my God.
It's already begun.

471
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:59,217
What's begun?
You know what's
going on, don't you?

472
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:02,353
Did a package arrive here?
You know about this?

473
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,790
When did package arrive
and how did it come?

474
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,058
We didn't know
what it was.
How did it come?

475
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,560
It was in a bag
on the porch.

476
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:10,395
You took it
out of the bag?

477
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,698
Yeah, Zilla already got
the living shit beat out
of him, okay?

478
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:17,035
And Erica's stuck
in there, in the
fucking mirror.

479
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,707
With him.

480
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,878
Killjoy.
Yeah.

481
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,881
Killjoy. We gotta go
in there and get her.

482
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:34,720
No, no, no.
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

483
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:41,727
Excellent, excellent.

484
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,529
His soul
is the most crucial.

485
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:48,033
Baby, what's so
important about him?

486
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,036
He is the fool
who conjured me.

487
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:54,239
It's his blood
that fed my resurrection.

488
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:57,175
And it's got to be his
blood that completes me.

489
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,545
Pumpkin, then why are we
waing our time

490
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:02,714
with these dumb kids?

491
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,784
Bat, you floozy!

492
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:09,821
We've got to get
that old man in here.
He's got to come to us.

493
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:13,558
Besides, they just rot
when you kill them out there.

494
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,828
Sorry, Mr. Crabbycakes.
Yikes!

495
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:20,565
I still don't get why you
care so much about this one.

496
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:24,903
Because this one
stiffed me.

497
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:30,341
This one owes me a victim.

498
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:33,244
You cannot just summon
a demon of vengeance

499
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:36,247
and not have a victim
to sacrifice.

500
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:41,720
I need sacrifice!

501
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:45,390
I need blood.

502
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:51,096
[Rojer] Let me see
if I got this right.

503
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:53,231
His name isn't even
Killjoy?

504
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:57,002
Not his real name,
not the original one.

505
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:02,573
How do we kill
this thing and
get out of here?

506
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,645
And that's my job,
and your job is to
get your friend back.

507
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:31,169
This is the research
that I've been doing
on this demon.

508
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:35,073
As you can see, Killjoy's
a relatively new name,

509
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,344
but he's existed
in the canon since
ancient times.

510
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,646
So why does he keep
coming back?

511
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:46,051
People conjure him
for vengeance.

512
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,219
Just to wreak havoc
and revenge.

513
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:52,190
I get it.
What does he want with you?

514
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:55,861
Well, we have
a disagreement.

515
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:57,695
You gotta
be kidding me.

516
00:44:57,763 --> 00:45:01,199
That's not important.
Do you wanna get
your friend back?

517
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:02,700
Or don't you?

518
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:05,771
Yeah, we do.
What's the plan?

519
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:09,140
We created demons.
We created religion.

520
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,443
We created the books
that gave them life.

521
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:19,918
We feed them
with our thoughts,
our prayers

522
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:22,487
but we're also the ones

523
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,190
that wrote the book.
What does that mean?

524
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:29,828
It means that if we
understand the demon,

525
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:34,232
we can control it.

526
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:37,068
And I can make it
feel pain.

527
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:39,204
So tell us what to do.

528
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,439
What I'm going to do
is call Killjoy

529
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:45,210
by his true name,
his original name,

530
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,712
and then that will
give me power over him.

531
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,380
And then with the knowledge

532
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,983
that I've gained
from these ancient pages,

533
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:59,757
I'll be able to banish him.
Why don't you tell us
his real name now?

534
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:02,527
It must be
in his presence.

535
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,730
All you have to do is
get your friend back
through the mirror,

536
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:09,000
and I'll handle the rest.
You sure you can take care
of him on your own?

537
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:12,938
I've been doing research
on this demon for years.

538
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:15,040
I'll deal with it.

539
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:22,113
Okay,
when do we go in?

540
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,915
You getting
cold feet now?

541
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:26,217
Cold feet?

542
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,153
Young man,

543
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:29,821
We're about to
come face-to-face

544
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:32,891
with a pure expression
of evil.

545
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:36,361
If you're not afraid,
you will be.

546
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:40,298
Come on, come on,
what's taking them so long?

547
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:46,137
Perhaps I should give
them some incentive, eh?

548
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,080
Come on out! Come on!

549
00:46:57,015 --> 00:47:01,219
What the hell was that?
Shit, man,
I got a bad feeling about this.

550
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:03,588
No shit.

551
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:09,294
[Killjoy]
What's the holdup?

552
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,463
Dinner is ready and waiting.

553
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:17,903
If you don't come,

554
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,838
Guess that was
the dinner bell.

555
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:24,175
Ready, guys?
How could it wait?

556
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,283
Let's get it over with.

557
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,519
I'll go first.

558
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,155
Booya!

559
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:14,425
Hello, pretty boy.

560
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,461
[slurps]

561
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:19,864
Am I supposed to be here?

562
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:23,401
Sure you are.
Where else would you be?

563
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:26,204
On a rescue mission,
I think.

564
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:31,109
Finally, someone
to take me away
from all this.

565
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:33,211
Really?
Save me!

566
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:35,713
Hey, I got a girlfriend.

567
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,485
What? How dare you make
lewd and lascivious advances

568
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:44,555
on me when you
got a girlfriend.
Think of her.

569
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,524
I am. I am.

570
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:55,433
You are what?

571
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:04,709
You're one of those
crazy psycho-bitches,
aren't you?

572
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:09,314
I think that's
the sweetest thing

573
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,184
anyone's ever told me.

574
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,746
[grunts]

575
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:56,194
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can we talk?

576
00:49:56,261 --> 00:50:00,098
Remember,
just get your friend.

577
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,700
Leave Killjoy to me.

578
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:05,036
Okay.

579
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,517
What the fuck!

580
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,055
Hey, baby,

581
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:26,991
where have you been
all this time?

582
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,526
I've been a good girl.

583
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:31,396
Really?

584
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:35,066
Have you?
Yes.

585
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:38,002
Where's Erica?
What, you mean dinner?

586
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:41,406
The main course.

587
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,174
Where's Rojer and Zilla?

588
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:47,412
Those two pathetic clowns
are being well taken care of.

589
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,214
Don't worry about them.

590
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,084
You fucking bastard,
you better not hurt
my friends or I'll...

591
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:54,419
Or what?

592
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:58,423
People keep saying that

593
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,591
and I want to know what.

594
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:04,462
Let me guess.
You're going to
call me names.

595
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:08,733
No. Well, then,

596
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,436
maybe you're going to
laugh at me.

597
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:15,606
Do you find me funny,
huh? No?

598
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:18,109
Watch this.

599
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,550
Didn't you think
that was funny?
No.

600
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:29,320
Well, then
you gotta dance.

601
00:51:29,387 --> 00:51:32,557
What?
Dance!

602
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:44,669
Dance.

603
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:51,209
Get this through
your pretty little head,

604
00:51:51,276 --> 00:52:00,485
when you say "or what,".

605
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:02,720
Or what?

606
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:07,225
You'll never see
your friends again.

607
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:10,461
We'll have just
a quickie, you know?

608
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:14,465
In and that's it.

609
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:16,234
Don't you mean in
and out?

610
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,803
I got teeth everywhere,
honey.

611
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,173
There's no out.

612
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,510
Shit!

613
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,945
Your girlfriend won't know.

614
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:31,382
She will if my dick's
bitten off.
Really?

615
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:36,086
Don't you got a boyfriend?

616
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,256
What a dreamboat.

617
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:39,890
Killjoy.

618
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:43,794
If you're cheating on him,
he'll cheat on you.

619
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:48,132
He wouldn't do that.

620
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,900
How do you know?

621
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,539
You see, Punchy,

622
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:57,275
what I'm getting at
is social equality

623
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,344
is not just
a textbook concept.

624
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,947
It's a reality,
and not just back on earth.

625
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,683
There is no reason why
you can't demand justice,

626
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,652
why you can't
demand equality,

627
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:11,088
some roll-on deodorant.
And it all starts with you.

628
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,958
The higher-ups aren't
gonna do a damn thing
about it.

629
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,527
They just sit on your shoulders
while you do the brunt
of the work.

630
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:20,631
What the hell gives Killjoy
the right to push you around?

631
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,534
[gibberish]

632
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:26,304
Come again.
Bunnies.

633
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,639
Bunnies.

634
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,442
Now dance!

635
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,280
Why fight it?

636
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,221
What's that?

637
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:19,324
Why fight it?

638
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,527
I'm already trapped here.

639
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:26,331
You're not so bad.
I take offense at that.

640
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:30,568
I mean...

641
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,605
You're kinda sexy.

642
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:38,909
Hell, you're hot.

643
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,549
You noticed. Yeah,
I work out a little bit.

644
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,017
It's not all
balloon puppets,

645
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:49,687
creamy maggot pies
and juggling, you know?

646
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,622
See that?

647
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:58,663
It would appear
that you're trying
to make a deal with me.

648
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,431
Look,

649
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:04,402
I know who's boss
around here.

650
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:08,005
I can get used to this.

651
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:11,275
I'm not a fool.

652
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:13,043
But I can be one

653
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,312
for you.

654
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:25,423
So you want to bargain
for your life?

655
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:29,427
What could you
possibly offer me?

656
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:32,997
I could offer you
something that you've
never had before.

657
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:36,300
And what would that be?

658
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,403
Consensual sex.

659
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,608
And...

660
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,746
I'm a virgin.

661
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:51,816
[gasping]

662
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:56,721
Thank you, evil one.

663
00:55:56,787 --> 00:56:00,458
Here's something...
I'm gonna take...

664
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:04,328
I've never had
consensual sex before.

665
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:06,797
I'm sorry.
Follow my lead.

666
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,934
Okay.

667
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,939
[thud]

668
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:16,641
Nothing.

669
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,477
I thought you said
you were a virgin.

670
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:24,649
I watch a lot of porn.

671
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:31,055
Take me. I'm yours.

672
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,624
Okay.

673
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:43,934
Oh. Hey, baby,
what are you doing here?

674
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,871
I see you're playing

675
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:49,640
with your food.

676
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:54,512
This? This is not
what it looks like.

677
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:58,783
Okay, chowder breath.
What's it look like?

678
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:04,822
She was coming on
to me.

679
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,892
Are you actually
telling the truth?

680
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:11,729
Yes, yes.

681
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:13,798
Ow!

682
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:16,667
Damn it, Batty!
What the hell!

683
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:19,870
Am I supposed
to believe that?

684
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,206
Yes, mm-hmm.

685
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:27,311
Besides, you get
to play with your food.

686
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,147
Weren't you just getting
your rocks off with
her boyfriend?

687
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:32,149
What?
[Batty and Killjoy] Shut up!

688
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:35,553
I'm a succubus.

689
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,957
That's my job.
What's your excuse?

690
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:47,632
[laughing]

691
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:50,334
I'm Killjoy.

692
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,839
I don't need no
stinkin' excuse!

693
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:03,948
[laughs]

694
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:10,555
Let vengeance be mine.

695
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:58,669
Power to the people,
Punchy.

696
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:01,772
Power to the people!
Power to the puppies!

697
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,442

698
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:09,013
What's that?
Yum yum now.

699
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:13,050
Oh, God.

700
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:30,034
Welcome all to my feast.

701
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,805
The feast of souls.
The feast of fools.

702
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:43,814
Well, what are you
waiting for? Dig in!

703
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:53,824
But before we get
to the main course...

704
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,929
You, Professor,

705
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:02,232
tried to cheat me.

706
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:03,834
What?

707
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:05,502
What is he talking about?

708
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:10,240
A mistake for which you
and your friends will pay!

709
01:00:10,307 --> 01:00:12,910
It was not a mistake.

710
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,178
What are you talking about?

711
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:16,580
No?

712
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:18,783
Enlighten me.

713
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,317
You are a foul aberration,

714
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,352
A sick stench
in the human mind.

715
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:25,355
You lure desperate people
into your trap.

716
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:29,059
You prey on the weak,
promising them strength,

717
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:32,062
and then you take
everything they have.

718
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,098
Do I know you?

719
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:43,741
You will.

720
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:46,643
Kinda makes me hungry.

721
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:48,312
Say it.

722
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,646
Say it now.

723
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:55,285
Say what?

724
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:59,056
Dinner time!

725
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,358
No!

726
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:03,027
No!

727
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:05,896
[screaming]

728
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:10,000
Aah!

729
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:26,383
Why aren't you doing anything?

730
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,319
Ah, you...

731
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,459
Aah!

732
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:38,328
[grunting]

733
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:46,070
Hah! Ha ha!

734
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,371
Come on.

735
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,941
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

736
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:53,043
No!
Ha ha ha!

737
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:58,282
[laughing]

738
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:02,086
Ooh.

739
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:07,124
Punchy!

740
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,226
You fat blundering idiot!

741
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:11,796
Destroy him!

742
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:16,867
Punchy,

743
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:18,635
now remember
what we talked about.

744
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:21,405
There is no reason
you have to take
this abuse from him.

745
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,173
"Aboose"?

746
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:32,516
He has to take
whatever abuse I give him!

747
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,086
Punchy, listen to me.
These are nothing but rules.

748
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:38,322
He doesn't have
any real control over you.

749
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:43,994
Me crush you.

750
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:47,832
No, Punchy, no!
I am the boss!

751
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:55,405
Raah!

752
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:15,025
[growling]

753
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:33,210
What the hell are you doing?
Why don't you say his name?

754
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:37,281
Yaah!

755
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,852
He already killed
Rojer and Erica!

756
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,058
Uhhn!

757
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:04,774
Hah!

758
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,077
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha!

759
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:09,413
There's the mirror.

760
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:10,814
Aah!

761
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:14,084
No one's going anywhere!

762
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:16,720
It's time for dessert!

763
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,957
The only way you're getting
out of here is inside of me!

764
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:24,161
Feardarig!

765
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:26,964
Feardarig!

766
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:29,967
That is your true name.

767
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:33,370
I have many names!

768
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:36,240
And this book
contains them all!

769
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:37,574
Red Cap!

770
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:41,311
Loki! Manthu!

771
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,846
I command you!

772
01:04:42,913 --> 01:04:48,585
I control you!

773
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:51,855
I am the father
of one of your victims...

774
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:58,862
One of the people
that called you
from the depths,

775
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:03,233
You tricked me.

776
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:09,006
You used these kids
to distract me, to weaken me,

777
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:13,477
To exact your plan
of revenge. Ha ha ha!

778
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:14,911
What?

779
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,814
Professor, is that true?

780
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:21,151
Careful.
When hunting monsters,

781
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:24,421
you may become one yourself.

782
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:26,223
I know what I am!

783
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,958
You sold us out!

784
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:32,963
I'm doing what has to be done!

785
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:40,904
It's so devious.

786
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:42,906
I'm proud of you.

787
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:47,411
I was the object
of your revenge.

788
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,447
I was the one!

789
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:52,316
Imagine that. Ow!

790
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:56,453
All this time it was me.

791
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,022
Shut up!

792
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:01,058
Why...

793
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:04,961
here's the part
you don't want to hear.

794
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:07,564
The fatal flaw
in your little plan!

795
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:14,404
You see, you're right.

796
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,372
[panting]

797
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:18,008
I am a part of you... aah...

798
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:20,677
And you are all a part of me!

799
01:06:20,744 --> 01:06:22,279
I said shut up!

800
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:25,049
Aah!

801
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:29,353
Your son is a part of me!

802
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:34,224
How will you avenge him?

803
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,596
[Young man's voice, echoing]
Good to finally meet you, Dad.

804
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:41,565
No.

805
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:44,268
It's me... Michael.

806
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,735
The son you never met.

807
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:49,939
Michael?

808
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,176
That can't be you.

809
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:54,678
Dad, we all become Killjoy.

810
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,580
When we call on him
for vengeance,

811
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:57,614
we become part of him.

812
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,383
Soon you'll join us.

813
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,018
Dad, soon we'll be together.

814
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,357
I have power over you.

815
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:08,925
Is my name in the book?

816
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:12,929
Does it say Michael in there?

817
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:18,502
You see,
we create these demons.

818
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:21,305
Welcome to the family.

819
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:25,542
Fucker!

820
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:38,688
[laughing]

821
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,357
What the fuck?

822
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:44,294
He's a clown. Laugh.

823
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,110
He's a clown. Laugh.

824
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,320
[groaning]

825
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,324
What are you laughing at?

826
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:26,836
Hoo!

827
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,356
Aah!

828
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:50,394
[barking, growling]

829
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:53,630
Gotcha!

830
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:07,544
[laughing]

831
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:09,513
Stop that!

832
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:16,119
I still have
the Professor's soul.

833
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:17,554
I can live.

834
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:20,390
Feardarig!

835
01:09:22,426 --> 01:09:24,628
Your name is Feardarig!

836
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:27,497
[laughing]

837
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,409
No.

838
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:42,612
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

839
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:47,951
No!

840
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,821
No!

841
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,594
Oh, no.

842
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:10,240
[laughing]

843
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:38,768
[laughing]

844
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,544
She hasn't stopped
laughing yet.

845
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:49,713
And what about
her friends?

846
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:51,748
The police are still
trying to get her

847
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:54,551
to say where she
dumped the bodies.

848
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:55,752
We can help her.

849
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:58,488
We can
stop the laughing.
