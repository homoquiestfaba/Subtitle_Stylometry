1
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,240
Huangshi's Kid

2
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,400
How about playing basketball later?

3
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,680
Are you nuts?

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,440
Maybe.

5
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,640
I used to be on a boat

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm sympathetic to you, man

7
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
but I have to stay healthy

8
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm marrying on Tuesday

9
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Congratulations

10
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,360
So, I have to be back
to Nanjing on time

11
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm the driver of
the Red Cross

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,600
Really?

13
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,320
You are going to Nanjing

14
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,760
Yeah, I'll start two days
before the wedding

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,720
Let's have a drink together

16
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,760
Great

17
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,880
I have a good idea

18
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,640
ok

19
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,520
I told you,

20
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,280
journalists can't
go to Nanjing

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,960
So just ask the Japanese

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,640
They are the master now

23
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,960
Bath, this is my best friend,

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,440
Endilis, he came here
to visit his love

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm Jiashlong

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,525
Hello

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,720
This is Captain Lujibath,

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
the bitch of British consular

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,160
I met Mr. Fet before

30
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,240
Excuse me, help yourselves

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,880
His girlfriend,

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,000
they will get married Tuesday.

33
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,840
He won't come back on Tuesday

34
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,320
He would go to
hill tomorrow morning

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,640
You son of a bitch, you are the
one who gave him the passport.

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Fuck you, how long we
have been friends?

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,240
Please forgive me, Mr. Aps

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,520
He is not a journalist.

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,520
He is a member of Red Cross,
so he could get the passport.

40
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,000
We need the passport to Anji

41
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,000
since we are the member
of Red Cross.

42
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,360
We can finally go to
Nanjing, Baers.

43
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,320
Trust me

44
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm Endis, you are Felibaks.

45
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,000
We are drivers for the Red Cross.

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,520
You send the
medicine to Nanjing.

47
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,640
For this,

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,840
Endis wants to get married.

49
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,840
If you do this, we
can help all of them.

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,880
God, are you crazy.

51
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,120
shit.

52
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:50,720
Eide.

53
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,480
Eide.

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,840
Eide is over there.

55
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,880
Who's that?

56
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,080
I know who he is.

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,840
Why'd he come here?

58
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,840
He's going to Nanjing as well.

59
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,840
Just keep your watch
one hours ahead.

60
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,840
Now we should use
the Tokyo zone.

61
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Do you know what
Tokyo speak in Japanese?

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
They are here to help Chinese.

63
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,200
They said that Chinese
is disordered.

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,440
Ride, military, and the fight.

65
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,840
They came here
to help you Chinese.

66
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,320
Nonsense.

67
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,520
They are not against China.

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,000
I told you why they
do not try to straight a war

69
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,920
if they don't do that

70
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,000
they can capture
Chinese people as they wish

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
and they can do anything
without be blamed

72
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,120
Japanese are not barbarians

73
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,280
But they thought others are

74
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,120
See

75
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,480
So many people

76
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,960
They are coming from Nanjing

77
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,960
World War II begins

78
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,080
but we don't know that

79
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,560
Parking

80
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,280
park over there

81
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,240
Parking

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,280
our identity were Americans

83
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,440
so just speak in English

84
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
got it, captain

85
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,840
We are Red Cross

86
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,680
the materials in the car
is sending from Britain

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,080
we must check the car

88
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,160
guys

89
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,520
get into the car

90
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,040
hey, all of you

91
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,280
sorry, captain

92
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,160
These substances are
disinfect drugs

93
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
Can you

94
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,600
just be careful

95
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
when you check these things

96
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
as they are very precious

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
ok

98
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,240
go

99
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
if you don't come
back before nine

100
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,240
I have to go alone

101
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,920
ok

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
good luck

103
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,480
you two, that way

104
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,760
hurry up

105
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,160
I'm trapped in a building
which is bombed down

106
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,520
there are many Japanese
soldiers outside

107
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
the city is so quiet

108
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,520
keep in line

109
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
go go

110
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,160

111
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,360
there is one

113
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,560
Tokyo impress me very well

114
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
I've been there for
three months

115
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,400
and I met so many
good guys there

116
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,720
and I think there
are very good

117
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,560
China

118
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,000
so many things to painted

119
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,000
but I don't paint very good

120
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,360
do you want more tea?

121
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,680
no, thank you

122
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,000

123
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,880

124
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000

127
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
British

128
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,760
who do you know

129
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,840
no one would wear like
this but janelist

130
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,120

Who are you

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,080
this is the
Commissioner of Tax

134
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
my first name is Chen

135
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,960
Chen Haisheng

136
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,920
Chen Haisheng you can
tell me Haisheng

137
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,400
why they want to kill you

138
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,000
they don't capture British

139
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,840
I saw something
should not be seen

140
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,600
really?

141
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,040
I took pictures, and
they found me

142
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,080
No wonder

143
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Perhaps I should not be asked

144
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,320
but why you hide here

145
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,840
they are killing
people outside

146
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,840
we are not many staff

147
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
and their weapon are
more powerful then ours

148
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,360
so we have to wait

149
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,560
Hold this

150
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,200
we intend to bomb
several houses before we leave

151
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,840

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,200

156
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,080
We try to go to British
Consulate

157
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,920
maybe they can get
you out of Nanjing

158
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,720
You must leave

159
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,360
you must tell the whole
world, what is happening here

160
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,080
This is my favorite

161
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,280

162
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400

164
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,520

shoot

168
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,880

169
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,840
shoot

170
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,560

171
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,200
hand your passport to me

172
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,600

173
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,960
don't let him go

174
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,840
stop

175
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,000
fire, fire fire

176
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,440
you hurt badly

177
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,640
I can't feel pain

178
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,960
maybe it's too cold to feel pain

179
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,440
your bleed too much

180
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,200
but, you still survived

181
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,720

him, he save your life

182
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,440
thank you very much

183
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,160
he told me

184
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,360
right, Liu

185
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,040
now, you are in the hospital

186
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
and you speak a lot
while you are in a commer

187
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,360
and you

188
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,320
you speak English very good, and
you must not learn it from text book

189
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,080
I learn it in military
academy

190
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,080
I thought you are a
member of Communist Party

191
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
yes, I am

192
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,080
surprise?

193
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,960
This only shows that you are still
not understanding China very well

194
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,320
I do not think that
you love helping others

195
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,880
as lease, you won't help a man

196
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,160
I can't leave him alone

197
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,120
he said you have to
wait at least for a month

198
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,520
I can't take him
back to Shanghai

199
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,560
Miss Sears

200
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,600
Please tell me what should I do

201
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,280
to help this guy

202
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,320
Haishan, did you know a
place called Hauangshi

203
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,840
I came here to teach building

204
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,480
but now I teach the
farmer how to bomb

205
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,320
actually, I think
that would be fun

206
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,560
Really?

207
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,360
of course, ti have armed organization
in the basement of Japanese

208
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,240
I have to go tomorrow

209
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,160
I'll go with you

210
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,760
I am going to report what
happened in the front line

211
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,640
to the whole word

212
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm not worrying
about you

213
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,200
I am worried about those
who have to take care of you

214
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,240
but there's a
place called Huangshi

215
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,680
in the west

216
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,720
you can get some information
while you get yourself cured

217
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,240
and you can improve
your Chinese

218
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,280
and then go to the front line

219
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,360
let me introduce myself

220
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,160
I'm Nangua

221
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,200
Very good

222
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,160
You understand?

223
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,160
Of course

224
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,520
you said let me introduce myself

225
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm a pig

226
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
This area is the place
Communist Party get controlled

227
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,080
This area is our
brothers in the KMT

228
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,840
keep heading west
Along this railway

229
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,880
Huangshi probably here

230
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:50,400
Huangshi

231
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,320
the place you want
to go to Huangshi

232
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,920
get down

233
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,845
what happened

234
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,560
They are not Japanese

235
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
yeah, they are not

236
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,920
they are the army
of Jangjieshi

237
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,560
The KMT, yes

238
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,880
I thought they
are your brothers

239
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,280
sometimes we are brothers,
don't you fight Japanese together

240
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,360
that depends

241
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
and I think they are not
at this time

242
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,640
and they can't be

243
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,600
what are they doing

244
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,760
they are capturing
strong man to be their soldier

245
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,840
they are come from south

246
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,880
and far away soldiers

247
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,000
and they can't run away

248
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,200
as they are trapped

249
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,560

250
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,720

271
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,880

288
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,320

290
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,720

291
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,440
and I would never come back

292
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,360
He is to frighten you

293
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,080
just tell me, Sikai

294
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,360
why I do that

295
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,280
why are they acting
like monsters

296
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,760
How long have you
been to China

297
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,285
5 weeks

298
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,840
how about you

299
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Five years

300
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,080
come here, let me have a look

301
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,400
you are that nurse Li

302
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,320
Phillips

303
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,520
Hello, My name is George

304
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,680
I know who you are

305
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,520
Let you come here is my idea

306
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,840
Children haven't had such
a good m for a long time

307
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,240
Outstanding Niujin
university academics

308
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,480
Haisheng introduce you to us

309
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,320
but, he call you Mr Pig

310
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,480
that is not funny

311
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,480
here it is

312
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,320
out of my way, what are you doing

313
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,040
that kid is very thin

314
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,040
he is very impressive

315
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,960
He saw his father was beheaded

316
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,120
Sister and mother were raped

317
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:15,200
And then beheaded

318
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,760
Japanese drive him and many people
rushed to the edge of mass graves

319
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,400
Ready to kill them

320
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,880
He had escaped by
pretending to be dead

321
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,360
ok, don't say that

322
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
I've been there while
these happened

323
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,480
Hansheng told me, so
he told you to come here

324
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,440
and give you a Chinese name

325
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,360
so the kid can remember you

326
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,080
my name is Heke

327
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,960
stop that, I won't stay here

328
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,600
I came here

329
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,480
not to be the
babysitter for these kids

330
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,840
OK

331
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,440
tell me how to go to
the front line, I can go myself

332
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,440
as you wish

333
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,640
why they help you

334
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,840
everyday, people die of cold

335
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,440
Arbitrary or breaking cold

336
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,960
I would tell them
if they keep running

337
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
maybe you just feel inch first

338
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,760
but you would have a
fever next day

339
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,520
if you don't care

340
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,880
your bone would pain

341
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,040
and you can't open your mouth

342
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,240
and you teeth would hold
tight, and you would die slowly

343
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,120
I have the bag with
the Royal anti-drug needles

344
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,520
if I go, they
don't have the medicine

345
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,840
so who would play with me

346
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,080
so, why don't
they close the school

347
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,120
just let the kids
go back to home

348
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,280
This is not a school

349
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,280
It seemed like a schools

350
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,440
This is an orphanage

351
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,880
every child here has
the experience as Kai Shi

352
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,520
don't you want to collect
information on the war?

353
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,840
we got all the
information you want

354
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,880
they don't need a teacher

355
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,640
but one who take care for them

356
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,880
Bed is full of lice

357
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,040
so do the kids

358
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,320
they are so lovely

359
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Those who have
lice infection typhoid

360
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,000
ok

361
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,520
they should be disinfected

362
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,600
How to disinfect them

363
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,360
by hot water

364
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,040
Good idea

365
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,405
Louse powder, they don't
want to use that

366
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,600
But the problem is let them
know that this will not pain

367
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,440
You can find a way

368
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,320
Heke has lice

369
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,720
Grasp

370
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,040
These lice let him sick

371
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,000
See this louse
powder to kill lice

372
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,480
But he will not hurt

373
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,160
Laugh

374
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,560
Very happy Heke

375
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,960
take off your clothes

376
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,360
why are you
embracing, hurry up

377
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,120
what is he doing, hurry up

378
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,400
Hand

379
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,680
don't go

380
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,880
slowly

381
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,000
Beat him

382
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,720
we won't cut your hairs
off if you have no louse

383
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,440
Can you guarantee that?

384
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,760
Not so vain, Mr Pig

385
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,720
I'm not

386
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,640
what's this

387
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,880
Coffee

388
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
Coffee

389
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,000
drike

390
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,360
this is the first couple of
coffee when I left Shanghai

391
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,160
why you came to China

392
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,760
as China is in trouble

393
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,040
Everybody is waiting for the
arrival of voice upstairs blood

394
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Waiting for the next war

395
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,560
Like it was in a cellar
waiting for the arrival of storm

396
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,760
I went to the United
States first

397
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,960
Take two cars across
the United States

398
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,120
Americans hided in their bed

399
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,160
the British were even worse

400
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,000
War

401
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,960
What kind of war, sir

402
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,480
the Great Depression comes

403
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,360
Later, I went to japan,

404
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,120
where I learned Japanese

405
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,640
Japanese tell you they want war

406
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,160
if you don't believe
me, just ask them

407
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,280
Then to the Nanjing

408
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,400
it was horrible

409
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,600
I killed people just for
help some innocent people

410
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,200
I never know that I
have so much hatred

411
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,560
Everyone would hate
them, don't blame yourself

412
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,520
But, we shouldn't

413
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,880
My whole family are pacifists

414
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,040
They are not as
good as you thought

415
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Not really

416
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,440
They are famous

417
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,560
Handi together with
my mother drinks tea

418
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,480
My father in the war
when peace Zunguo prison

419
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,520
He is the bravest men

420
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,240
Now I think they are wrong.

421
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,400
Sometimes I think
we must use force

422
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,560
In the war at
the expense of others

423
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,400
I can be and
typewriters Zuoban

424
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,720
Now, even typewriters are lost

425
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,920
you save George Today,

426
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,280
Although you would
not look like a hero

427
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,560
and you cannot feel it either

428
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,760
but, what you done
is very remarkable

429
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,200
Not slept well

430
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,680

431
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,400
A child diarrhea

Make dirty

433
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,920

and then you have
to think by yourself

439
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,600
I could only do this for you

440
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,880

I'm Heke

485
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,720
I'm looking for Boss Wang

486
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,400
glad to see you, Mr Heke

487
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,000
our house is nearly broken

488
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,000
Because of war

489
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,960
There are also gambling
revolutionary war drugs

490
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,280
so many ways to spend money

491
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,840
but we gain for nothing

492
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,840
I have to receive
hard currency

493
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,400
if you can pay in
the Chinese current

494
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,960
sorry, the price have to redouble

495
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,960
I would like to
pay by vegetables

496
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,200
Chinese cabbage is
also a kind of hard currency

497
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,605
British humor

498
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,120
You give us food
and seeds first

499
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,200
We plant, when we harvest

500
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,640
you can take your part

501
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,520
Harvest is not guaranteed, Heke

502
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,720
what's that

503
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,920
the rice from the last year

504
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,280
it won't grow very well
in the climatic conditions

505
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,440
done

506
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,880

it won't grow like that,
you are just waste seeds

511
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,240
pray to god that god
would bless us

512
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,840
hope that we could
have a harvest

513
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,080

Kai Shi

525
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,600
don't expect that I
can convince him

526
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,720
We can only minimize
the damage he

527
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,560
I'm just nervous

528
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,640
You never told me
why you come here

529
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,880
for freedom

530
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,280
I can only stay in Narita
result of this temporary clinics

surgery in the candlelight

532
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,480
You are surgeon

533
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,520
the people who die will
not mind if you have some titles

534
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,160
No one helps you

535
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,240
you have to do it by
yourself alone

536
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,440
I am not a nurse

537
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,080
Just as you, you are not a
teacher either

538
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,920
In China, we would become another
personal Therefore, we come here

539
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,240
I was a soldier Malila's wife

540
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,640
But I did not participate
in the wedding

541
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,600
Life is ridiculous

542
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,320

543
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,120

00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,680
although I have to climb all days

573
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,360
But I will trace her

574
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,160
kiss her

575
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,120
Pulling up her hand

576
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,840
go with her in to the bushes

577
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,280
Xiaoqing

578
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:37,840
it's ok

579
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,920
it's ok, no one would hurt you

580
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,080
Goats

581
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,360
are you crazy, how
many have they eat

582
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,080
it is used to clear the lawn

583
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,320
My mother is a good gardening

584
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,760
she uses the goats

585
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,840
listen, Heke

586
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,720
don't touch my things

587
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,840
Sorry, I hope you
can live in comfortable

588
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,760
I don't like that

589
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:11,760
where are you going

590
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,320
ok, I don't ask, but
when do you come back

591
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,680
don't ask that

592
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,040
you can't go like this

593
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,400
Lee

594
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,840
how's Uncle Qi today

595
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,440
He aggravated the tumor

596
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,320
he needs more pain medicine

597
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,400
it will kill him

598
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,200
that is not too bad

599
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,840
Today, I heard that solution of the
KMT have been made is little bit problem

600
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,840
all of them will be ahead

601
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,880
I heard that too

602
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,560
all those who drugs
and that criminal

603
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,120
Japanese to chop your
head because you are Chinese

604
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,200
what can I do
for you, Miss Puers

605
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,320
I thought you had
the Wang on-powder

606
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,840
No one use Wong On-powder

607
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,760
Even the Japanese don't

608
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,560
Your friend must
be very depressed

609
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:46,440
no one want to play with him

610
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,280
He must be very lonely

611
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,400
I think he would be fine

612
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,840
Because you never lonely

613
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,200
if you think so, you can visit him

614
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,640
I don't want to wash time
on someone who don't need me

615
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,080
Do you have something
similar to morphine?

616
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:09,760
Only these?

617
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:10,880
yes, I have

618
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,720
You are not the
only customer of mine

619
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,280
just replace with this

620
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,320
You know how they evaluate this

621
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,960
You still feel pain

622
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,080
But he could not have hurt you

623
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,520
Six months ago
they were a hungry and dirty

624
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,880
Sick completely useless waste

625
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,760
Now I really admire you

626
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,160
Heke, I did not
expect you will be successful

627
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,240
I must confess
that my wife Wang

628
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,480
I did not expect

629
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,960
I hope you receive this gift

630
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,840

Silk Road

635
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,120
It is 2,000 years of the link
connecting the East and the West

636
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,440

637

642
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,560
Mineyasu

643
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,120

644
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,925

657
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,680
He also too small

658
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,360
