1
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,146
Warren?

2
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,154
You'll wakeyourselfup.

3
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,985
I'll getyou breakfast.

4
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,116
No time.
The meeting starts at 1 0:00.

5
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:09,652
Don't worry about it.
They always have coffee there.

6
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,995
You're flying down?

7
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:16,002
I'll check out one ofthe trainers.
Then I can get backwhen I want.

8
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:27,180
What areyou doing today?

9
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,681
Shopping.

10
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,218
Have to get clothes
for the boys.

11
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,515
They grow so fast.

12
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,689
Need any money?
I cashed a check.

13
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,539
I had the dream again.

14
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,202
Always ends at the same place.

15
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,545
I guess that'sjust as well.

16
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:06,053
Sometime I'm going to see
that matador, find out who he is.

17
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,848
When I do, that's the end ofme.

18
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:13,052
Don't talk like that.
It's only a dream.

19
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,059
Maybe I ought to resign.

20
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,066
What good would that do?

21
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,729
I'm sure it would make the dream
go away. They're connected.

22
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:29,643
Katie,
the dream and what I'm doing--

23
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:36,047
Sometimes I feel the onlyway
I can make it disappear is to resign.

24
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:39,917
Butyou can't resign.
You can't give upyourwhole life.

25
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,749
You're my life too.

26
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,760
You and the boys.

27
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,757
Maybe I have to choose.

28
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:57,064
Or maybe it's too late.

29
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:59,902
Warren, don't go.
Skip the meeting.

30
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:01,771
Tell them mywife insists
I go shopping?

31
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,004
I'll skip the shopping.

32
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:06,979
We could have lunch together.
We haven't done that in months.

33
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:09,073
A little French restaurant
with wine.

34
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,017
This meeting is special.
The secretarywill be there.

35
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:15,214
They're even holding it in the war room
to show how up-to-date we are.

36
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:19,123
You could do with a day off.

37
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,128
In the middle ofthe week?
That's immoral.

38
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,367
We can go out for dinner.
I'll be back by then.

39
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:28,902
IfI can get a sitter.

40
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:33,629
You got me.
You can get anything.

41
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,657
What would I do withoutyou?

42
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,659
You wouldn't do verywell.

43
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,366
There's no chance ofthat,
is there?

44
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,161
None at all.

45
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:45,913
Firstyousaid 100million dead.

46
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:49,144
Firstyousaid 100million dead.

47
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:51,548
Nowyou say 60 million.

48
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,053
I say 60 million is perhaps
the highest price...

49
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:56,715
we should be prepared
to pay in a war.

50
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,488
What's the difference between
60 million dead and a hundred million?

51
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,223
- Forty million.
- Some difference.

52
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,858
Areyou saying saving 40 million lives
is ofno importance?

53
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,561
You miss the point, Professor.

54
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,037
Saving those 60 million lives
is what's important.

55
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:15,007
Face facts, Mr. Foster.
We're talking about war.

56
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:19,240
Everywar, including thermonuclearwar,
must have a winner and a loser.

57
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,110
Which would you rather be?

58
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:25,585
In a nuclearwar, everyone loses.
War isn't what it used to be.

59
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,712
It's still the resolution
ofeconomic and political conflict.

60
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:31,246
What kind ofresolution
with 1 00 million dead?

61
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,953
- It doesn't have to be 1 00 million.
- Even 60!

62
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:36,929
The same
as a thousand years ago, sir...

63
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,762
when you also had wars
that wiped out whole peoples.

64
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:44,066
The point is still who wins and who
loses, the survival ofa culture.

65
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:45,605
A culture?

66
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,607
With most ofits people dead...

67
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,109
the rest dying,
the food poisoned...

68
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,940
the air unfit to breathe.

69
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,107
- You call that a culture?
- Yes, I do.

70
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:58,447
I am not a poet.
I'm a political scientist...

71
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,047
who would rather have an American
culture survive than a Russian one.

72
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:08,118
But what would it really be like?
Who would survive?

73
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,804
It's an interesting question.

74
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,638
I would predict...

75
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,975
convicts and file clerks.

76
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:32,481
The worst convicts, those deep down
in solitary confinement...

77
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,987
and the most ordinary
file clerks...

78
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,524
probably for large
insurance companies...

79
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:39,957
because theywould be
in fireproofed rooms...

80
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:44,487
protected by tons ofthe best insulator
in the world: paper.

81
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,659
Then imagine what will happen.

82
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,466
The small group ofvicious criminals
will fight the army offile clerks...

83
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,167
for the remaining means oflife.

84
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,301
The convicts
will know violence...

85
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:01,109
but the file clerks
will know organization.

86
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,673
Who doyou thinkwill win?

87
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,547
It's all hypothesis, ofcourse,
but fun to play around with.

88
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,953
Time to go home. I didn't mean
to hold forth so long.

89
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,726
I don't usually come to a supper party
and talk through to breakfast.

90
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,360
Nonsense. We were fascinated. I hope
we didn't keepyou from yourwork.

91
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,700
Not at all. I've got
a 1 0:00 meeting at the Pentagon.

92
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,433
Plenty oftime
to get home and change.

93
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:29,408
You must come again,
Professor Groeteschele, with yourwife.

94
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,035
I'd be delighted.

95
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,891
I'm Ilsa Wolfe.
We were introduced before dinner.

96
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,560
I'd likeyou to take me home.

97
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:07,372
You'll have to give me directions.

98
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:10,076
Just stay on this road.

99
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,600
You couldjoke about the convicts
and file clerks...

100
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,629
becauseyou know
there won't be any survivors.

101
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:35,140
Not many.

102
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,872
None at all.

103
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,281
That's the beauty ofit.

104
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:49,448
I've heard nuclearwar called
a lot ofthings, but never beautiful.

105
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,890
People are afraid to call it that,
but that's what they feel.

106
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,393
The beauty ofdeath?

107
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,952
Don't patronize me.

108
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,125
What else but that
areyou selling, Professor?

109
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,694
We all know we're going to die...

110
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:10,233
butyou make a marvelous game out ofit
that includes the whole world.

111
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:16,240
- You make it seem possible.
- It is possible, even probable.

112
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:19,878
You make death an entertainment...

113
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:22,821
something that can be played
in a living room.

114
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,414
As good a place as any.

115
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,323
There's an even better place.

116
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:35,097
Turn in there.

117
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:55,852
This whereyou live?

118
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,016
Don'tjoke.

119
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,220
Why not?
I am thejoker.

120
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:04,822
I make death into a game for people
likeyou to get excited about.

121
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:07,025
I watched you tonight.

122
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,035
You'd love making it possible.

123
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,401
You'd love pressing that button.

124
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:14,202
What a thrill that would be.

125
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,209
Knowing you have to die...

126
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,872
to have the power
to take everyone else with you...

127
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,542
the mob ofthem with their plans,
their little hopes...

128
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,882
born to be murdered
and turning away from it...

129
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,218
closing their eyes to it.

130
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,886
You could be the one
to make it true, do it to them.

131
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,656
Butyou're afraid...

132
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:39,324
soyou look for the thrill
someplace else.

133
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,335
And who better
than a man who isn't afraid?

134
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,183
I'm notyour kind.

135
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,275
- Airman?
- Sir?

136
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,282
General Bogan should be on his way in.
Tell him I checked out the new computer.

137
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,012
I'll be back on duty before he leaves
to check it out again with him.

138
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:34,714
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be in my quarters ifhe wants me.

139
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:36,619
- Yes, sir. Sir?
- Yes?

140
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,282
A telephone message foryou.

141
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,123
Theywantyou to call back,
said it was urgent.

142
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:53,003
Line, please.

143
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,848
Hello.

144
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,820
Yes, I got the message.
Why doyou think I'm calling?

145
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,320
Where did he get the money?

146
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,991
No, I'll come myself.

147
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:32,607
I'm going into town, Airman.
That's the address.

148
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,045
I'll be there about a halfan hour,
then I'm coming back to the base.

149
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:36,548
Yes, sir.

150
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,113
Better button up
before the general gets here.

151
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:41,620
Yes, sir.

152
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,790
General Bogan's office.
Airman Slote.

153
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,622
No, sir, General.
Hejust left.

154
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:50,720
Damn it, I need him.
Where did he sign out to?

155
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,201
Conklin, you know where that is?

156
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:03,533
Yes, sir.
It's on the way to the base.

157
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,376
Get over there. I'll pick him up
myself, Airman. Thankyou.

158
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,717
- This is the house, General.
- You sure this is it?

159
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,552
There's not another street
by this name?

160
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:20,889
I've in Omaha all my life. I know
this city like the back ofmy hand.

161
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,828
Don't bother getting out.

162
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,926
- Spending the money I send you on this!
- Give me that!

163
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,087
You raiseyour hand
against my mother once more--

164
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,758
Just a drop!
Who the hell areyou?

165
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,298
- Yeah?
- I'm General Bogan.

166
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,168
I'm looking for Colonel Cascio.
He gave this address.

167
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,936
- Sure, General.
- Let the gentleman in, Luke.

168
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,378
Honored to haveyou.
My son always speaks well ofyou.

169
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:15,608
Sorry to botheryou, Colonel.

170
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:18,173
We have some unexpected VI Ps
we have to show around.

171
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:24,685
Yes, sir.
I'll be right along.

172
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:27,784
Why don'tyou come in, General?

173
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,455
Thankyou, I--

174
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,596
I just take a drop now and then.

175
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:39,036
The boy here gets a little excited.

176
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:40,630
I'm ready, sir.

177
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,141
Damn snot-nosed kid.

178
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:15,397
It's that Congressman Raskob,
who's been nosing around the bases.

179
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,500
Washington wants us
to put his mind at ease.

180
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:22,242
- He's on one ofthose committees.
- Yes, sir.

181
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:27,151
Gordon Knapp will also be there to look
at that equipment his company makes.

182
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,188
He'll be on our side.

183
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,020
Anyone looks cross-eyed at his stuff,
he goes up like a rocket.

184
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,525
Yes, sir.

185
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:40,562
Time was when I'd say,
''goes up like a balloon.''

186
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:45,200
- Times change.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:53,740
Ploesti wasarough one.

188
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:57,375
We lost halfour group.

189
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,215
Regensburg was the worst one for us.

190
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,223
I never flew the B-1 7, only B-24s.

191
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,756
The 24 was a good airplane.

192
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:11,730
You knewyou were flying it, not the
otherway around, like today's things.

193
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:14,426
You still have to fly
the Vindicator, Grady.

194
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:16,901
We're the last ofthe lot, Flynn.
Don't kid yourselfabout that.

195
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,373
- The next airplanes won't need men.
- You'll be too old, anyway.

196
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:24,501
After us, the machines.
We're halfway there already.

197
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,974
Look at those kids.

198
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,245
Remember the crews
you had on the 24s?

199
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,583
Jews, Italians, all kinds.

200
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,919
You could tell them apart.
Theywere people.

201
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,118
These kids-- You open them up,
you'll find they run on transistors.

202
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:43,754
- They're good kids.
- Sure.

203
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,197
You know they're good at theirjobs,
butyou don't know them. How can you?

204
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:49,929
We get a different crew
every time we go up.

205
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,437
That's policy, Grady.

206
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,838
It eliminates the personal factor.

207
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:57,138
Everything is more complicated now.

208
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,804
Reaction time is faster.

209
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,543
You can't depend on people
the same way.

210
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:06,313
Who doyou depend on?

211
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:09,287
All right, gentlemen.
The sky awaits.

212
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:15,451
You know something, Billy?

213
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,657
I like the personal factor.

214
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:51,856
Those are Vindicator bombers
ofthe Strategic Air Command...

215
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:53,490
on routine patrol.

216
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,502
Each one ofthose planes carries
four Bloodhound air-to-air missiles...

217
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,333
armed with nuclearwarheads.

218
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,169
Those are for use
against attacking enemy planes.

219
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,574
In addition, each plane carries
two 20-megaton hydrogen bombs...

220
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:06,976
designed to detonate
over enemy targets.

221
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:10,346
At any given moment, night or day,
those airplanes are in the air...

222
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,715
in case ofany surprise attack
on our bases.

223
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:14,720
You can see some
ofthe other groups--

224
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:16,619
- Who controls them?
- We do.

225
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,682
This room is the nerve center,
Mr. Raskob.

226
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,696
These machines are constantly receiving
information from all over the world.

227
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,561
And above it.

228
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:28,897
Mr. Knapp's company did the electronic
work on the Argos satellite.

229
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:32,996
Would you like to see what
it's photographing right now? Colonel.

230
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:37,373
This pictureyou're about to see
is being taken now...

231
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,642
by a camera 300 miles in the sky
traveling 20,000 miles an hour.

232
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,554
Can you give us tighter scale on this?

233
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,055
Colonel?

234
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:10,372
Those are the rocket sites
from 300 miles up.

235
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:13,241
- I'm impressed.
- We'll get it sharper soon.

236
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,645
Be able to see the people,
notjust the machines.

237
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:18,741
We'll showyou
the hair on their head.

238
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,414
-I suppose they're doing the same to us.
-You can see foryourself.

239
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,083
Let's take a look at the Russian
submarines in the Pacific.

240
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,093
There's the western coast ofthe
United States, Hawaiian Islands...

241
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,753
and those are Russian subs.

242
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,358
- That close?
- Nearest is 50 miles offSan Francisco.

243
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:37,870
International waters. Nothing
we can do except keep an eye on it.

244
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:40,498
That's too damn close.
What's it doing there?

245
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:43,099
Scanning us, the waywe do them.

246
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,110
Is it armed?

247
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:04,119
We have instruments so good,
they can tell the difference...

248
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,429
between a whale breaking wind
and that sub blowing its tanks.

249
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:12,961
No argument, General. I'm sure
we've got the best money can buy.

250
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:17,638
- We're proud ofwhat we do here.
- You ought to be, Colonel.

251
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,306
- The money is well spent.
- I don't doubt it for a minute.

252
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,973
And you don't have to snow me.

253
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,813
My committee doesn't deal
with appropriations...

254
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,979
onlywith how
the appropriations are spent.

255
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:31,990
You see it all around you.
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

256
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:36,160
Truthfully, these machines
scare the hell out ofme.

257
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,163
I don't like the idea
that every time I take offmy hat...

258
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,166
some thing up there
knows I'm losing my hair.

259
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,032
I want to be sure that thing
doesn't get any ideas ofits own.

260
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:47,540
I see whatyou mean, but that's
a chanceyou take with these systems.

261
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:49,541
Who says we have to take that chance?

262
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,942
Who voted who the power
to do it this particularway?

263
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:55,038
I'm the only one around here
that got elected by anybody.

264
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:56,673
Nobody gave me that power.

265
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,342
It's in the nature oftechnology.

266
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,010
Machines are developed
to meet situations.

267
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:02,179
Then they take over,
they start creating situations.

268
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,884
- Not necessarily.
- There's always the chance.

269
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:09,019
We have checks and counterchecks
on everything.

270
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:10,790
Who checks the checker?

271
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:13,799
Where's the end ofthe line?
Who's got the responsibility?

272
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,664
- The president.
- No one.

273
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,795
He can't know everything that's
going on. It's too complicated.

274
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:21,864
Ifyou want to know,
that's what really bothers me.

275
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,434
The only thing everyone can agree on
is that no one's responsible.

276
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,384
Is something wrong, General?

277
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:36,218
UFO sighted
near Hudson's Bay, sir.

278
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,883
Whatyou're seeing, gentlemen,
is an unidentified flying object...

279
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,756
picked up by our radar.

280
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:44,160
Until we get positive identification,
we regard it as hostile.

281
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,720
What doyou do about it?

282
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,098
We've gone to Condition Blue,
which is our lowest form ofreadiness.

283
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:51,569
At the same time, we've informed
those Vindicator bombers...

284
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,436
thatyou saw in the air before.

285
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:58,307
Theywill now start to fly
toward their fail-safe points.

286
00:23:58,378 --> 00:24:01,176
'' Fail-safe''?

287
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:03,772
Fixed points in the sky
on the perimeter ofthe Soviet Union...

288
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,579
which are changed from day to day.

289
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,586
The planes will fly to those points
and orbit...

290
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,248
until they get
a positive order to go in.

291
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,915
And ifthey don't get that order?

292
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,153
They return to their normal patrols.

293
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:17,788
In short, we can't go to war
except on an express order.

294
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:19,889
How do they get that order,
by radio?

295
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:23,629
Yes, and through a box we call
the fail-safe box aboard each plane...

296
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:26,866
which can only be activated
at the express order ofthe president.

297
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,431
- He has to tell them?
- Not directly.

298
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,272
His voice can be imitated.

299
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,142
Hejust gives the order
and the rest is done electronically.

300
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:37,206
No one can interfere
with the fail-safe box, Mr. Raskob.

301
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,117
All those new blips you see
are fighter planes...

302
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:44,884
going after
the unidentified object.

303
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,791
Colonel Cascio,
tight scale, please.

304
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,428
You seem pretty cool about this,
General. Does it happen often?

305
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,525
About six times a month.

306
00:24:55,602 --> 00:24:58,036
Probably an airliner offcourse.

307
00:24:58,104 --> 00:25:01,130
- And ifit isn't?
- Then it's something else.

308
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:07,976
That means it's at 30,000 feet,
going 525 miles an hour...

309
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,539
on a compass heading of 1 96.

310
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:12,175
Headed right for Detroit.

311
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:14,311
Sevenminutes to fail-safe.

312
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,155
Normal procedure, Mr. Raskob.

313
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:23,991
We start an automatic countdown
at this point.

314
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:28,999
It's very unlikely the bombers
will even reach their fail-safe points.

315
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,004
It happens one time in twenty.

316
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,836
We usually identify the disturbance
well before that.

317
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,284
Sixminutes to fail-safe.

318
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:58,353
What haveyou got there, Blackie?
Another UFO?

319
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:02,026
For a dollar, a commercial plane
or a flock ofbirds?

320
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,366
Plane. Offcourse.

321
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,371
You ought to give me odds.

322
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,844
I read your memo
on counterforce credibility.

323
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:18,213
I don't think Groeteschele
will discuss that today.

324
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,181
You think I should lay off?

325
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:23,188
Why open a can ofpeas?

326
00:26:23,256 --> 00:26:25,554
We've got to discuss it
one ofthese days, Stark.

327
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,058
This whole policy ofoverkill--

328
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,722
It makes no sense piling up bombs
when we already have a capacity--

329
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,163
Just not today.

330
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:37,892
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

331
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,236
- Won'tyou sit over there?
- Thankyou.

332
00:26:43,877 --> 00:26:46,402
- Good morning, Mr. Secretary.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

333
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:58,084
- Everyone here, General Stark?
- Yes, sir.

334
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:06,856
All right, Professor Groeteschele.

335
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:11,495
I see we have an alert
to supplement our discussion.

336
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:15,234
Unfortunately, we settled the question
ofaccidental war last week...

337
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:19,608
so we can't make use ofit today.

338
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,045
Today the subject is limited war.

339
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:24,106
It is not theoretical.

340
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,118
On it depends
the kind ofweapons we use...

341
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,245
where we locate them,
how we use them.

342
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:30,812
In short,
our entire military posture.

343
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,484
Is limited war possible?

344
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,324
Can we confine the exchange
ofnuclearweapons...

345
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:37,954
to military targets alone...

346
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:41,797
or must war lead inevitably
to the destruction ofcities?

347
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,336
- It must.
- Why?

348
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:49,034
The object ofwar is to inflict
maximum damage on the enemy...

349
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:51,474
destroy his ability to resist.

350
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,809
In the last war, both sides
could have used bacterial warfare.

351
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,078
- They didn't.
- It wouldn't have been decisive.

352
00:27:58,151 --> 00:27:59,743
Can you be sure?

353
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,311
Maybe people still couldn't get used
to the idea ofkilling civilians.

354
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:08,122
Take that up with the civilians
of London, Hamburg, Dresden orTokyo...

355
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:11,254
killed by the thousands
in bombing raids.

356
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:13,060
I omit Hiroshima and Nagasaki...

357
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:15,999
since those actions belong
more properly to World War III...

358
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,661
than World War II.

359
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,173
I still don't see
how we could restrict a war.

360
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,971
We could come to a mutual agreement
with the Russians...

361
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:27,342
to strike only at missile bases.

362
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:30,007
What ifthe missile bases
were near the cities?

363
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,347
Theywould have an incentive
to move them elsewhere.

364
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:35,717
They might take such an offer
as a sign ofweakness on our part.

365
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:39,519
- It could be worth a try.
- They have as much to lose as we have.

366
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,924
We're talking
about the wrong subject.

367
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,060
We've got to stop war,
not limit it.

368
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:49,731
That is not up to us, General Black.

369
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:51,531
We're the ones
who know most about it.

370
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,869
You're a soldier, Blackie.
You carry out policy.

371
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,377
- You don't make it.
- Don't kid yourself, Stark.

372
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:01,345
The waywe say a war can be fought
is making policy.

373
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:05,077
Ifwe saywe can fight
a limited warwith nuclearweapons...

374
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:06,584
we let everyone offthe hook.

375
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,314
It's what theywant to hear.

376
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:12,085
We canjust keep doing what we're doing,
and nobody really gets hurt.

377
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:14,422
Butyou can't fight a limited war,
and you know it.

378
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:16,394
I'm not so sure.

379
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:19,226
There's no such thing
as a limited war anymore.

380
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,029
Not with hydrogen bombs.

381
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:25,298
Once those bombs start to drop,
you won't be able to limit a thing.

382
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,999
Areyou advocating disarmament?

383
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,943
I don't know.

384
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:39,416
It's the logic ofyour position.

385
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:42,613
Peculiar reversal.
The press would be interested.

386
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:47,092
The military man who is the dove,
and the civilian who is the hawk.

387
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:52,123
We're going too fast.

388
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:53,688
Things are getting out ofhand.

389
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:55,700
Can you be more specific, General?

390
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:58,731
We're all trying
to make war more efficient.

391
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:01,706
- That's ourjob.
- And we're succeeding.

392
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:05,210
We now have the capacity to blow up
the whole world several times over.

393
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,769
Which does not mean
we must do it.

394
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,783
We won't be able to stop from doing it.
That's the logic ofyour position.

395
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,279
We're setting up a war machine
that acts faster...

396
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,880
than the ability ofmen
to control it.

397
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:20,983
We're putting men into situations
that are too tough for men to handle.

398
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,789
Then we must toughen the men.

399
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,127
Suppose they launch
a first strike against us?

400
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,794
Then we retaliate,
and we're all finished.

401
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,566
Would you prefer
that onlywe were finished?

402
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:36,972
We have to prepare.

403
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:42,071
We're preparing.
We've got to slow down.

404
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:45,311
I disagree.
We have got to speed up.

405
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,979
Naturally,
that means taking risks...

406
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,615
but our intention is always
to minimize those risks.

407
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:54,683
Ofcourse, we can only control
our own actions.

408
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:59,562
Our concept oflimited war is based
on an equal rationality by the Russians.

409
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:03,659
It also presupposes there will be
no accidents on either side.

410
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:08,139
But suppose
that unidentified flying object...

411
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:12,041
was one oftheir 50-megaton missiles
that had gotten loose by mistake.

412
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:15,137
What could be done? How could they
prove it was really an accident?

413
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:17,341
Would it make any difference
ifthey could?

414
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:21,683
Even ifwe believe them, should we
still think oflimiting our response...

415
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,450
or should we hit them back
with everything we have?

416
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,925
It's gone, General.
What happened to it?

417
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:31,691
Colonel Cascio,
let's go to Condition Yellow.

418
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,698
It's dropped below the level
in which our radar can pick it up.

419
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,361
You went to the next state
ofreadiness.

420
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,531
That's standard operating procedure.

421
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:42,233
It could be a commercial plane
about to crash.

422
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:45,209
Or an enemy plane
taking evasive action.

423
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,576
Naturally, we prepare for the worst.

424
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:49,581
Twominutes to fail-safe.

425
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,888
What are those planes
following the bomber, General?

426
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,151
Fighter support.
Part ofCondition Yellow.

427
00:31:59,225 --> 00:32:02,592
From now on, they'll follow
the bombers as far as they go.

428
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:05,893
- What comes after Condition Yellow?
- Green.

429
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,728
- And then?
- Red.

430
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,893
But we've never gone to red yet.

431
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,062
Red means war, doesn't it?

432
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,253
- Not an air breather?
- What does that mean?

433
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,793
Jet planes suck air
through their engines.

434
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,352
Ourwarning system can pick up
the turbulence this creates.

435
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,456
Ifa commercial plane lost power,
no turbulence would be created.

436
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,763
It could be a rocket.

437
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,268
Offcourse?

438
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:46,998
Maybe on.

439
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:49,871
Oneminute to fail-safe.

440
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:53,434
It could be a Russian rocket coming in
low where our radar can't pick it up.

441
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,447
- Could it be that?
- It could be anything.

442
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,609
- How doyou find out?
- Our fighters are tracking it.

443
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:00,584
Can't wait too long.

444
00:33:00,653 --> 00:33:05,249
13, 12, 1 1, 10, 9...

445
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:09,260
8, 7, 6, 5, 4...

446
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:12,456
3, 2, 1.

447
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,966
Allgroupsatfail-safepoint.

448
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,559
Right on the dot.
That's flying.

449
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:21,205
- Yes, sir?
- Go to Condition Green.

450
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:32,144
Tell the planes to keep orbiting
until we positively identify the UFO.

451
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,812
- That's their orders.
- Tell them again.

452
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,822
- You'll have to leave now.
- Sorry.

453
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,656
- That is an order.
- You've got the wrong customer.

454
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:44,321
The way I see, we could be at war
injust about two minutes.

455
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,991
You can't get me back to my family,
so I'm staying here to see what happens.

456
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,658
There's no place foryou here.

457
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:51,168
Ifthose bombs go off,
there's no place for me anywhere.

458
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,933
You want me out ofhere,
you better call the military police.

459
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:56,839
- I think it's coming up again.
- We can't wait any longer, sir.

460
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,843
Give me a tight scale.

461
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,389
That's it, gentlemen.

462
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,085
Sorrywe alarmed you.

463
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,719
Contact all the planes and have them
resume their normal patrols.

464
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:51,786
Yes, sir.

465
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,700
Colonel Grady?

466
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:02,900
What is it, Thomas?

467
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,934
What's the longestyou ever stayed
at these fail-safe points?

468
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:09,743
The longest I ever stayed
was three minutes...

469
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:13,216
but it seemed like threeyears.

470
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:16,118
- This your first time?
- Yes, sir.

471
00:35:16,188 --> 00:35:18,588
- Nervous?
- No, sir.

472
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,922
It's only natural.

473
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:26,454
I wasjust calculating fuel, sir.

474
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:31,602
How is the group
holding formation, Sullivan?

475
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,434
They're right in orbit, sir.

476
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,600
Even number six is tucked in.

477
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,769
Old Flynn.

478
00:35:38,844 --> 00:35:41,438
Halfman, halfbird.

479
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:47,275
Thankyou very much, General.
I must say, it was quite--

480
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,949
- What's that, Colonel?
- Checking, sir.

481
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,473
It's okay here.

482
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,647
Send in a K-1 3.

483
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,646
Something blew in the fault indicator.
We're replacing the whole unit.

484
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,384
The fault indicator
is our master control.

485
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:28,689
It tells us ifsomething goes wrong
in any ofthese other components.

486
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:31,821
- Did something go wrong?
- No sign ofit.

487
00:36:31,897 --> 00:36:34,365
We'll know as soon
as they replace the unit.

488
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:54,352
Sir, the fail-safe box.

489
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:05,192
There must be some mistake.

490
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,027
Check Omaha.

491
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,164
Can't get through, Colonel.
Interference.

492
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:17,300
What kind ofinterference?

493
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,503
I don't know, sir.
It's a kind I never heard before.

494
00:37:19,578 --> 00:37:22,445
Try another band.
Try all ofthem.

495
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,586
Can't get through.

496
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,923
They must be trying to keep us
from getting our go signal.

497
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:34,221
They're too late for that.

498
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,592
Request permission to authenticate
on secondary channel.

499
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:39,290
Permission granted.

500
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:57,780
Order confirmed.
Request permission to verify, sir.

501
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,313
Permission granted.

502
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:41,550
Code sequence correct for today, sir.
Signal is go.

503
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:47,059
We will now both open
our operational orders.

504
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,667
Ready for approach
and penetration orders, sir.

505
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:30,331
You say these alerts happen
halfa dozen times a month?

506
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,673
About that.
Not usually so dramatic.

507
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,838
We rarely get
to the fail-safe point.

508
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,506
I'd be a nervous wreck.

509
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,176
So would I ifI had
to make a speech in Congress.

510
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:46,088
That blip up there at ten o'clock.
It's headed into Russia.

511
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,532
That is why some people advocate
a return to manned bombers...

512
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,364
for a first-rate retaliation,
rather than missiles.

513
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:01,702
They are slower and give more time
for evaluation and analysis.

514
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,708
The rockets have the defects
oftheirvirtues.

515
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:07,109
They are too quick.
They allow too little time for thought.

516
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,374
I find this point ofview
old-fashioned.

517
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,214
By the very nature
ofmodern warfare, the--

518
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:17,214
Put that on polar projection.

519
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,003
- Yes, sir?
- Get me the president.

520
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:39,909
I'm Buck, the translator.
They sent for me.

521
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,913
May I seeyour identification?

522
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:48,583
It says you have a small scar
on your left wrist. May I see it?

523
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,418
Yeah.
Dog bit me when I was a kid.

524
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,923
Yes, sir.

525
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,100
Hello, Buck.
How's your Russian today?

526
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:10,369
Fine, sir. I guess.

527
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:13,434
Good. We may need it.

528
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:18,113
Hang on,Jennie.
It's a long way down.

529
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:30,854
TellJoe nothing leaks
to the newspapers yet.

530
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:33,557
Call the vice president and tell him
what's up. He'll know what to do.

531
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:39,061
On second thought,
we better tell the press something.

532
00:41:39,138 --> 00:41:41,800
HaveJoe tell them it's urgent,
but not a bone-breaker so far.

533
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,808
And offthe record, no leaks.

534
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,936
Any leaks on this, the guy
and his paper are dead now and forever.

535
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:48,639
I'll tellJoe injust those words.

536
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:52,150
Who's at the Pentagon briefing today?
I want them in on this.

537
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:55,516
Secretary of Defense.
Chiefs ofStaff.

538
00:41:55,587 --> 00:41:58,317
That Professor Groeteschele
they like so much is giving the lecture.

539
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,654
- Is Blackie there?
- There's a General Black.

540
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,661
That's Blackie. I'm glad he's there.
We went to college together.

541
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,822
He's got a brain
and says what he thinks.

542
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,331
That's all for now.
Get to work.

543
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,664
Have them turn up the air-conditioning.
It's hot as hell down here.

544
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,771
We're far enough down.
Maybe it is hell.

545
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:21,644
- You know what's happened?
- No, sir.

546
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:24,011
One ofourVindicator groups
got a wrong signal.

547
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,348
They took offto bomb Moscow.
We've got to stop it.

548
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,718
Easier said than done.

549
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:35,817
But we've got a little time;
not much, but a little, so relax.

550
00:42:35,894 --> 00:42:37,691
Easier said than done, sir.

551
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,197
Ifthings get really hot...

552
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:42,199
I might have to use
the direct phone to the Kremlin.

553
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:46,135
That's whereyou'll come in.
Let's hope we don't get that far.

554
00:42:46,205 --> 00:42:48,400
I hope not, sir.

555
00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:52,501
- GeneralBogan from Omaha, sir.
- Put him on.

556
00:42:52,578 --> 00:42:56,036
Group Six is now about 200 miles
past fail-safe, Mr. President.

557
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,049
We still can't make contact.

558
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,211
- Doyouknow what went wrong?
- No, sir, we do not.

559
00:43:01,286 --> 00:43:04,221
Why can'tyouraise them byradio?

560
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:05,847
We don't know for sure, sir.

561
00:43:05,924 --> 00:43:08,916
We've tried all frequencies.
Wejust can't make contact.

562
00:43:08,994 --> 00:43:10,655
- Why?
- Idon'tknow.

563
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:13,061
We had a flash on the board
just before it happened...

564
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,726
and the fault indicator
blew out at the same time.

565
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,531
The Russians may bejamming
their reception with some new device...

566
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:20,071
weknownothingabout.

567
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,731
Whywould they do that?
Is it customary?

568
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,604
No, sir, but it's possible.

569
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:26,906
In otherwords, it's possible
the fail-safe mechanism...

570
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,412
might be giving them a go signal...

571
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,507
at the same time they can't reach you
for positive confirmation.

572
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:34,677
It's possible.
It's not probable, but--

573
00:43:34,753 --> 00:43:38,450
- Is it possible?
- Yes, sir.

574
00:43:38,524 --> 00:43:41,425
All right.
Ifwe regain radio contact...

575
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,223
will the bombers respond
to an order to return?

576
00:43:44,296 --> 00:43:46,093
Ifwe can reach them
within the next five minutes.

577
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,965
After that, their orders are
to disregard anyverbal command.

578
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:52,094
Even ifI talk to them?

579
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,264
Yourvoice can be imitated
by the enemy, sir.

580
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:56,102
Our men have been drilled in that.

581
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,767
Once they're
beyond a certain point...

582
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,243
they're not to trust
anyverbal transmission.

583
00:44:00,312 --> 00:44:03,543
What's our next step then, General,
ifwe follow standard procedure?

584
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,617
We already have
fighter planes in the air.

585
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,279
The next step would be to order
the fighters after the bombers...

586
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:12,380
to raise them visually
and divert them from their course.

587
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:14,789
What ifthe bombers don't respond?

588
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,193
The fighters would be ordered
to shoot them down.

589
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,968
Who gives that order?

590
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,528
You do, sir.

591
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,701
Thankyou, General.
I'll be back toyou.

592
00:44:36,315 --> 00:44:38,249
Get me Mr. Swenson
in the Pentagon.

593
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:01,863
Swenson here.

594
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,999
Mr. Secretary,
I have a decision to make.

595
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,668
It's my decision,
and I'll make it...

596
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,679
but I want the advice ofyou
and your people, and I need it fast.

597
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,851
The president says he may have
to order our fighters...

598
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,682
to shoot down Group Six.

599
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,189
He wants our opinion.

600
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:23,194
I oppose it, sir,
on the grounds that it's premature.

601
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,197
Our planes have notyet
reached Soviet territory.

602
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,233
They're still hundreds
ofmiles away.

603
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,700
We got to do it
right now before it's too late.

604
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,862
It might be too late anyway.

605
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,873
Those fighters swung away from
the bombers when they got the all clear.

606
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,000
They've been flying
in the opposite direction.

607
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:41,204
- They're faster than the Vindicators.
- Not that much faster.

608
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,807
-I'm not sure they can catch up in time.
-They can go to afterburners.

609
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:47,545
- That will increase their speed.
- And use up their fuel.

610
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,213
They'll never be able to get back.
They'll go down in the ocean.

611
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,554
- We've got to try it.
- Suppose they do catch up?

612
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,219
Why do they have to attack?
Can't they signal?

613
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,593
Our men have been trained
to expect anything from the enemy...

614
00:45:58,664 --> 00:46:01,565
even sending up his own fighter planes
disguised as ours.

615
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,396
They're good men.
We've seen to that.

616
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:06,403
Iftheir orders are attack, the onlyway
to stop them is to shoot them down.

617
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:09,065
We have no alternative.

618
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,904
This minute the Russians
are watching their boards...

619
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,910
trying to figure out
what we're up to.

620
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:17,244
Ifwe can't convince them it's an
accident that we're trying to correct...

621
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:21,013
we're going to have a situation
that nobody bargained for...

622
00:46:21,086 --> 00:46:23,077
and only a lunatic wants.

623
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,581
Mr. President...

624
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,287
it is our opinion that the fighters
should be ordered in.

625
00:46:30,362 --> 00:46:32,296
Thankyou.

626
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:39,595
General Bogan, please.

627
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:51,481
Yes, Mr. President?

628
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:55,111
The fighters are to overtake
the Vindicators...

629
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,621
and, ifnecessary,
shoot them down.

630
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,925
Sir, it will be necessary.

631
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:04,120
I know that, General.
Order them in.

632
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:17,634
Colonel, order the fighters
to attack Group Six.

633
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,474
They don't have a prayer
ofcatching them, sir.

634
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:26,312
That is an order.

635
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,479
But that's the Arctic Ocean
they'll go down in, General.

636
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:31,681
They'll freeze to death
before they get their chutes off.

637
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,486
Colonel, get on the horn
and give that order.

638
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:39,325
Every second you wait
takes them farther away.

639
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:43,491
We're killing them.
They haven't got a chance.

640
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:46,036
This is FighterDirection.

641
00:47:46,104 --> 00:47:48,937
Weare in voice communication
with Tangle-Abel-One.

642
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:52,340
Youcan talk to them on Channel7,
singlesideband.

643
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,178
Do I tell them in code
or in the clear?

644
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,013
In the clear.

645
00:48:01,386 --> 00:48:04,219
Tangle-Abel-One, this is
Colonel Cascio at Ultimate One.

646
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:07,019
This is Tangle-Abel-One.
Ireadyoufive-by-five.

647
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,026
Group Six has flown through
the fail-safe point...

648
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,153
and is on an attack course
towards Moscow.

649
00:48:11,229 --> 00:48:13,595
It is a mistake.

650
00:48:13,665 --> 00:48:16,725
Go to afterburners and overtake
and attack Group Six.

651
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,203
Roger.

652
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:24,038
Go toafterburnersandovertake

653

By the time we run outofgas,

659
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,561
- Man, that's organization.
- Cut the chatter.

660
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:51,932
We're wasting time.
On themark, go toafterburners.

661
00:48:52,003 --> 00:48:56,440
Five, four, three, two, one, mark.

662
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,743
Shall I alert Air-Sea Rescue, sir?

663
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:15,851
No point. Bring up the fighters
on the board in tight scale.

664
00:49:15,927 --> 00:49:17,360
Yes, sir.

665
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,104
Beautiful.

666
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,945
Fighters on their way, sir.

667
00:49:37,549 --> 00:49:38,982
Thankyou.

668
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,289
Buck, let's hope this all blows over
in the next few minutes.

669
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:49,453
But ifit doesn't,
we'll get to know each otherverywell.

670
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:53,624
Listen to every conversation I have,
try to get to know how I think.

671
00:49:53,698 --> 00:49:56,462
- It might come in handy.
- Yes, sir.

672
00:49:59,905 --> 00:50:03,466
- How did General Bogan sound toyou?
- Sir?

673
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:08,036
Did he sound worried?
Confident? Scared?

674
00:50:08,113 --> 00:50:10,513
Not scared.

675
00:50:10,582 --> 00:50:12,140
A little worried, I guess.

676
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,809
Bogan's an old-time flier...

677
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,648
but he's not afraid
ofall this new equipment.

678
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,484
Ifhe's worried, I'm worried.

679
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:21,492
Doyou know Mr. Swenson,
the secretary ofdefense?

680
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,460
I've read about him, sir.

681
00:50:23,528 --> 00:50:26,497
You won't be able to tell much
from his voice. He's hard as a rock.

682
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:31,832
But we listen to him, Buck.
Ifhe gives advice, we take it.

683
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,336
Yes, sir.

684
00:50:39,444 --> 00:50:41,344
Put the war conference room
at the Pentagon...

685
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,007
and General Bogan in Omaha
on a conference line with me.

686
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,515
Yes, sir.

687
00:50:47,752 --> 00:50:49,344
Ready, sir.

688
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,821
- Mr. Swenson?
- Yes, Mr. President.

689
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:56,350
Ifour fighters have to shoot down
the Vindicators, the worst is over.

690
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,794
For us, anyway.

691
00:50:58,863 --> 00:51:02,196
I wantyour people now to consider
what we do ifwe can't shoot them down.

692
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,668
I'm putting you on the intercom
soyou can be heard here and in Omaha.

693
00:51:05,737 --> 00:51:09,195
General Bogan has Mr. Knapp
ofAmalgamated Electronics...

694
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,538
andCongressman Raskob withhim.

695
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:15,546
They have my permission to listen in
and say anything theywant.

696
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,946
Right, sir.

697
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:24,550
Gentlemen, we've got four questions
to answer and not a lot oftime.

698
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,081
First: What happened?
Second: What do we do about it?

699
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:30,093
Third: What are the Russians
going to think about all this?

700
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:33,153
And fourth:
What are they going to do about it?

701
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:36,564
Please keep the discussion
to those points.

702
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,331
Mechanical failure.

703
00:51:39,404 --> 00:51:42,066
- That's what happened.
- A double mechanical failure?

704
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,405
- Doyou know the odds against that?
- Maybe someone went berserk.

705
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,573
It doesn't matter.
Something failed: a man, a machine.

706
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,912
It was bound to happen,
and it did.

707
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:56,181
Maybe we'll never know why orwhat.
It doesn't matter now.

708
00:51:56,254 --> 00:51:58,188
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes, GeneralBogan.

709
00:51:58,256 --> 00:52:01,020
Mr. Knapp here knows as much
about electronic gear as anyone.

710
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:02,354
He'dlike tosaysomething.

711
00:52:02,427 --> 00:52:05,954
The more complex
an electronic system gets...

712
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:08,192
the more accident-prone it is.

713
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:10,757
-Soonerorlater, itbreaks down.
- What breaks down?

714
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:14,396
A transistor blows.
A condenser burns out.

715
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:17,270
Sometimes theyjustget tired,
likepeople.

716
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:20,311
Mr. Knapp overlooks one factor.

717
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:22,471
The machines are supervised
by humans.

718
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:27,109
Even ifthe machine fails, the human
can always correct the mistake.

719
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,777
I wish you were right.

720
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:32,289
The fact is,
the machines work so fast...

721
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,120
they are so intricate...

722
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:37,286
the mistakes they make
are so subtle...

723
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,455
that veryoften,
ahumanbeingjustcan'tknow...

724
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,761
whetheramachineis lying
ortelling the truth.

725
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:45,792
Maybe this time
there wasn't any failure.

726
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:49,135
Maybe the Russians have masked
the real position ofGroup Six.

727
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,937
Maybe Group Six is flying back
to the States this minute.

728
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,137
Then what's on the board?
Northern lights?

729
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,579
Maybe a group ofSoviet planes,
up there to convince us...

730
00:52:57,649 --> 00:52:59,310
we'veaccidentallylaunched
abombergroup.

731
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,080
- Forwhat purpose?
- As an excuse to retaliate.

732
00:53:02,153 --> 00:53:04,144
Iftheywanted to do that,
theywouldn't need an excuse.

733
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,020
- They'dsimplyattack.
- This way, we commit our fighters...

734
00:53:07,092 --> 00:53:10,493
our firstline ofdefense,
andmade uskillourownmen.

735
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,655
I disagree with that analysis!

736
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:16,428
We have to assume it is our accident
and not their plan.

737
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:19,163
I agree, General.
Yes, Saunders?

738
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,172
A report that the Russians
have seven bomber groups in the air.

739
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,640
- Is that unusual?
- That's normal for them.

740
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:27,337
- About like us.
- What kind ofcourse are they on?

741
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:31,371
Normal patrol patterns
inside their own borders.

742
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:34,441
They have an abnormally large number
offighters in the air, sir.

743
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:36,009
Almost halftheir fighter strength.

744
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:39,454
They're having the same problem
with Group Six that we had with the UFO.

745
00:53:39,524 --> 00:53:42,516
They don't know what it is,
why it's there orwho it belongs to.

746
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,188
My guess is that
they know all about Group Six.

747
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,697
They saw it fly to the fail-safe point.
They've seen that happen before.

748
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,461
They know the procedure.

749
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:52,025
-So far, nosweat.
- And when they saw it fly past--

750
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,537
They sent up their fighter planes
just in case.

751
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:57,302
I don't think they'll take any action
unless their border is crossed.

752
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,605
Agreed.

753
00:53:59,677 --> 00:54:01,941
That puts it up to the fighters.

754
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,111
In my opinion,
theywill take no action at all.

755
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:11,019
Theywon'tjust sit there.

756
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:14,388
I think ifour bombers get through,
the Russians will surrender.

757
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,927
Who is the professor, Mr. Secretary?
What's he doing there?

758
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:20,487
Professor Groeteschele is a civilian
advisor to the Pentagon, General.

759
00:54:20,565 --> 00:54:23,557
Will you explain your statement,
Professor?

760
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,399
The Russian aim is
to dominate the world.

761
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,564
They think that Communism
must succeed eventually...

762
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,040
ifthe Soviet Union is left
reasonably intact.

763
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:33,942
They know that a warwould leave
the Soviet Union utterly destroyed.

764
00:54:34,012 --> 00:54:35,445
Therefore, theywould surrender.

765
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:38,346
But suppose they feel
they can knock us off first?

766
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:40,577
They know we might have
a doomsday system:

767
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:44,213
missiles that will go into action days,
even weeks, after a war is over...

768
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:47,918
and destroy an enemy even after
that enemy has already destroyed us.

769
00:54:47,992 --> 00:54:50,256
Maybe they think even capitalists
aren't that insane...

770
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,922
to want to kill after they
themselves have been killed.

771
00:54:52,997 --> 00:54:55,465
These are Marist fanatics,
not normal people.

772
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:58,263
They do not reason the way
you reason, General Black.

773
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,772
They're not motivated by human emotion
such as rage and pity.

774
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,432
They are calculating machines.

775
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,102
Theywill look at the balance sheet,
and theywill see they cannot win.

776
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,701
Then you suggest doing what?

777
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:13,074
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

778
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,618
The Russians will surrender...

779
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,154
and the threat ofCommunism
will be over forever.

780
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:19,713
That's a lot ofhogwash.
Don't kid yourself.

781
00:55:19,791 --> 00:55:21,782
There will be Russian generals
who would reactjust as I would:

782
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,794
the best defense
is a good offense.

783
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,559
They see trouble coming up, they'll
attack and won't care what Mar said.

784
00:55:27,632 --> 00:55:29,964
Mr. Secretary,
I am convinced...

785
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:34,266
when the Russians know bombs will fall
on Moscow, theywill surrender.

786
00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:38,469
They know that whatever they do then,
they cannot escape destruction.

787
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,807
Don'tyou see, sir?
This is our chance.

788
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,143
We neverwould have made
the first move deliberately...

789
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:46,012
but Group Six has made it for us
by accident.

790
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:48,814
We must take advantage ofit.
History demands it.

791
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,084
Wemustadvise thepresident
not torecall thoseplanes.

792
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:56,225
They're flaming out.

793
00:56:01,633 --> 00:56:03,396
He's firing anyway.

794
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,956
There goes number two.

795
00:57:16,274 --> 00:57:19,937
Mr. President,
the fighters have not succeeded.

796
00:57:21,012 --> 00:57:23,139
They'vegone down into thesea.

797
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:33,480
What are the chances ofour bombers
getting through to Moscow?

798
00:57:36,594 --> 00:57:39,256
We've made the calculations
a hundred times:

799
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:43,630
what they have in the way ofdefense,
what are planes are capable ofdoing.

800
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:48,229
The Vindicators fly so fast, the Russian
won't be able to use all their defenses.

801
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:53,040
One or two ofthe bombers
will get through.

802
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,213
Thankyou.

803
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,455
Buck, I'll talk
to the Soviet premier now.

804
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,554
You'll translate
what he says to me.

805
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:10,560
He'll have his own translator
telling him what I say...

806
00:58:10,628 --> 00:58:13,119
but I want something more
from you.

807
00:58:13,197 --> 00:58:17,429
- Yes, sir, whatever I can do.
- The premier says what he means...

808
00:58:17,502 --> 00:58:22,166
but sometimes there's more
in a man's voice than in his words.

809
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,403
There are words in one language
that don't mean the same in another.

810
00:58:25,476 --> 00:58:27,273
- You follow me?
- I think so, sir.

811
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:29,870
It's very important the premier and I
understand each other.

812
00:58:29,947 --> 00:58:31,380
I don't have to tell you that.

813
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:35,715
So I want to know what he's saying
and whatyou think he's feeling.

814
00:58:35,787 --> 00:58:38,950
Any inflection ofhis voice,
any tone...

815
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:42,186
any emotion that adds to his words...

816
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,989
I wantyou to let me know.

817
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,791
- Yes, sir. I'll do my best.
- I knowyou will.

818
00:58:45,863 --> 00:58:48,093
It's all any ofus can do.

819
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:50,566
Don't be afraid
to saywhatyou think.

820
00:58:50,635 --> 00:58:52,569
Don't be afraid all this
is too big foryou.

821
00:58:54,238 --> 00:58:57,833
It's big, but it still depends
on what each ofus does.

822
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,178
History lesson number one.

823
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:05,740
I'll talk to Moscow now.

824
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,926
It's thepremier, sir.

825
00:59:49,994 --> 00:59:53,452
Mr. Chairman, this is the president
ofthe United States.

826
00:59:53,531 --> 00:59:55,965
Doyou hear me clearly?

827
00:59:58,302 --> 01:00:02,204
Fine, Mr. President.
How areyou?

828
01:00:02,273 --> 01:00:06,039
I'm calling you
on a matter ofgreat urgency.

829
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,011
I hope it turns out
to be a small matter...

830
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,378
but it's the first time
it's happened.

831
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:13,314
Ifit's misunderstood,
it could be--

832
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:16,876
Does it have to do
with the aircraft...

833
01:00:16,954 --> 01:00:18,581
we have detected
flying towards Russia?

834
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,590
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

835
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:27,931
I suppose it's another ofyour
off-course reconnaissance flights.

836
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,102
Mr. President,
we have warned you repeatedly...

837
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,138
that this constant flying
ofarmed aircraft--

838
01:00:34,205 --> 01:00:37,663
This is a serious mistake.

839
01:00:37,742 --> 01:00:39,676
I say, it's a mistake.

840
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,641
Verywell.
Tell me the mistake.

841
01:00:46,717 --> 01:00:50,585
A group ofour bombers each loaded
with two 20-megaton bombs...

842
01:00:50,655 --> 01:00:52,680
is flying towards your country.

843
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,627
We shall watch with great interest...

844
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,129
whileyou recall them.

845
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,689
So farwe have been
unable to recall them.

846
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:11,239
Are the planes being flown
by crazy men?

847
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:14,767
We're not sure.
It might be a mechanical failure.

848
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:17,211
All I can tell you
is that it's an accident.

849
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:21,149
It's not an attempt to provoke war.
It's not part ofa general attack.

850
01:01:24,622 --> 01:01:28,217
How do I knowyou do not have
hundreds ofother planes...

851
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,894
coming in so low
our radar cannot pick them up?

852
01:01:33,264 --> 01:01:35,960
Because I hope to prove toyou
that it's an accident--

853
01:01:36,033 --> 01:01:37,625
that we take full responsibility...

854
01:01:37,702 --> 01:01:39,795
that we're doing everything we can
to correct it.

855
01:01:42,506 --> 01:01:43,939
- Go on.
- You must have seen...

856
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:46,704
that we sent fighter planes
to shoot down the bombers.

857
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:52,581
American fighters
to shoot down American bombers?

858
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,878
That is correct.

859
01:01:55,653 --> 01:01:57,814
- And you gave that order?
- I did.

860
01:02:00,491 --> 01:02:03,426
How do I know that the planes
were not simply diving...

861
01:02:03,494 --> 01:02:06,986
to a low altitude
to escape our radar?

862
01:02:07,064 --> 01:02:09,589
On our plotting board, the action
could only be interpreted...

863
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,430
as planes out ofcontrol.

864
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:13,834
You have the same equipment we do.
What did it tell you?

865
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:20,175
It did not tell us what is
in your mind, Mr. President.

866
01:02:20,244 --> 01:02:21,768
I'm telling you that.

867
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,476
And you ask me
to believeyou?

868
01:02:25,549 --> 01:02:26,846
You must believe me.

869
01:02:28,352 --> 01:02:30,820
You ask for belief
at a curious time.

870
01:02:30,888 --> 01:02:32,913
Ifwe don't trust each other now,
Mr. Chairman...

871
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:34,981
there may not be
another time.

872
01:02:38,229 --> 01:02:41,687
We sawyour planes
fall into the sea.

873
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,398
I wanted only
to hearyour explanation...

874
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:49,865
and whether it was done
atyour own order.

875
01:02:52,476 --> 01:02:56,003
It is a hard thing to order men
to their death, is it not?

876
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,172
It is.

877
01:03:00,685 --> 01:03:05,418
Sir, there's someone trying
to persuade him it's a trick.

878
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:07,480
Theywant him
to strike back at once.

879
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,157
Soviet airspace has still not
been violated, Mr. President.

880
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,199
But ifit is, we will be forced
to shoot down your bombers.

881
01:03:18,502 --> 01:03:22,495
And then we will come to full alert
with all our missiles and planes.

882
01:03:22,573 --> 01:03:25,838
I understand that. I hopeyou're able
to shoot down our bombers.

883
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:30,803
But I urgeyou not to take any steps
that cannot be recalled.

884
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,285
You know we must
protect ourselves.

885
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,447
You also know that ifyou
launch missiles, we must do the same.

886
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:41,514
Ifthat happens, there'll be
very little left ofthe world.

887
01:03:44,295 --> 01:03:45,922
I understand.

888
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:47,930
Is there anything more
you wish to say?

889
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:49,863
IfI may make a suggestion...

890
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,893
I will arrange to open
a conference line...

891
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,733
between our headquarters
in Omaha...

892
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:57,603
and your similar officials
in the Soviet Union.

893
01:03:57,675 --> 01:03:59,734
We will do all we can
to helpyou.

894
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,870
We do not need your help.

895
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:07,384
We are perfectly capable
ofdefending our country.

896
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:11,410
As you wish, but I must tell you
what my people tell me.

897
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:13,354
No matterwhatyou do...

898
01:04:13,424 --> 01:04:16,484
at least one ofthe planes
will get through to the target.

899
01:04:18,295 --> 01:04:19,557
What is the target?

900
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,790
Moscow.

901
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:26,526
I'll call you backwhen I see
what our fighters do.

902
01:05:21,759 --> 01:05:24,159
How's the formation holding,
Sullivan?

903
01:05:25,496 --> 01:05:27,430
Everyone in line, sir.

904
01:05:27,498 --> 01:05:29,989
- How far from the border?
- Two minutes.

905
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,961
We better start spreading out.

906
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:39,735
Number six plane in the lead.
Flynn.

907
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,209
Righthere, Colonel.

908
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,079
- Go to work.
- Roger.

909
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,911
Project the Soviet fighter planes.

910
01:05:51,088 --> 01:05:53,113
Give me tight scale
on the Russian border.

911
01:05:58,395 --> 01:06:01,057
- That does it.
- They've crossed the border.

912
01:06:03,634 --> 01:06:05,864
Well, Buck,
we're into Soviet territory.

913
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,935
A technical state ofwar
now exists.

914
01:06:18,048 --> 01:06:20,516
Give me Enemy Defense Performance.

915
01:06:20,584 --> 01:06:22,643
This is EnemyDefense
Performance Desk, GeneralBogan.

916
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,085
How doyou read
the situation?

917
01:06:24,154 --> 01:06:26,019
Ournumbersixplane

918

919
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:30,458
All thosenewblipsyousee

920
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,325
Have the Russian fighters
launched any missiles?

921
01:06:32,396 --> 01:06:34,956
Notyet. You'llsee theirmissiles
onyourscopeas tiny dots...

922
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,023

andthen disappear.

Theregosome ofthem now.

924
01:06:38,702 --> 01:06:40,431
Youcansee
they're confusedby the decoys.

925
01:06:40,504 --> 01:06:42,631
They'restillnotgrouping
where therealplanesare.

926
01:06:43,474 --> 01:06:46,875
Can you wipe the decoys offthe screen
so we seejust their planes and ours?

927
01:06:46,944 --> 01:06:48,673
Thereyouare, General.

928
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,408
They'restillgoingafterdecoys.
Ourboysaren'tmakingiteasy.

929
01:06:52,483 --> 01:06:53,711
Good.

930
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,982
They'vepickedup
one ofourplanesnow.

931
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,352
Get them. Get them!

932
01:07:12,503 --> 01:07:14,334
Knock that off!.

933
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,930
This isn't some damn football game!
Remember that!

934
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:20,934
Thatplane's in trouble.

935
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:35,215
It looks like the Soviets
have a very slow missile...

936
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:38,159
with a much longer range
than we thought they had.

937
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:40,594
The slowness ofspeed
made our missile calculate...

938
01:07:40,664 --> 01:07:42,461
they must be drones or decoys...

939
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:44,865
so it ignored them
and went after the fighters.

940
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,966
We can compensate for that.
The adjustment is minor.

941
01:07:55,012 --> 01:07:56,673
Thepremieris on theline, sir.

942
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:00,980
Yes, Mr. Chairman?

943
01:08:03,654 --> 01:08:06,122
We have only
a little time left, Mr. President.

944
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:09,826
His voice is subdued, sir.

945
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,229
It's not angry.
It's subdued.

946
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,456
How shall we use this time?

947
01:08:17,768 --> 01:08:21,260
He sounds sorrowful, sad.

948
01:08:21,338 --> 01:08:23,465
What luck
areyour fighters having?

949
01:08:25,709 --> 01:08:26,733
Luck?

950
01:08:27,578 --> 01:08:29,375
No luck at all.

951
01:08:29,446 --> 01:08:31,437
We have shot down
only one ofyour bombers.

952
01:08:31,515 --> 01:08:33,506
What about the other five?

953
01:08:35,352 --> 01:08:37,047
Maybeyes, maybe no.

954
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:41,351
Your masking devices
are better than we had thought.

955
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,287
Hundreds oftargets
have appeared on the radar.

956
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,432
Perhaps they are decoys.
Perhaps they are real bombers.

957
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,162
Many ofmy experts
are convinced that they are real.

958
01:08:53,771 --> 01:08:56,296
They urge me to release
our own bombers at once.

959
01:08:56,373 --> 01:08:57,431
Why don'tyou, then?

960
01:08:59,143 --> 01:09:01,611
- Good question.
- Why haven'tyou counterattacked?

961
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:05,406
I am gambling
thatyou are sincere.

962
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:09,679
My generals are not so happy
with me about this...

963
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:13,849
as I'm sureyour generals
are not so happywith you.

964
01:09:13,924 --> 01:09:15,915
But there is time
for common sense.

965
01:09:18,462 --> 01:09:20,726
I must have proof,
Mr. President.

966
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:22,891
Neither ofus wants war...

967
01:09:22,966 --> 01:09:26,129
but we must be convinced
that this is...

968
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,568
truly a mistake--

969
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:30,664
thatyour intentions are not hostile
and that there is a chance for peace.

970
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:33,676
Mr. Chairman,
let me askyou something.

971
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:37,711
Just before our planes took off
from their fail-safe point...

972
01:09:37,781 --> 01:09:40,477
there was a white flash
on our plotting board.

973
01:09:41,485 --> 01:09:44,454
We think this is connected
to some mechanical failure...

974
01:09:44,521 --> 01:09:46,352
that might have activated
their ''go'' signal.

975
01:09:46,423 --> 01:09:49,915
Could this have been caused
byyour radio interference?

976
01:09:51,328 --> 01:09:53,819
They're arguing
with him again, sir--

977
01:09:53,897 --> 01:09:56,923
telling him not to answer--
the information is too secret.

978
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,663
Was ityourjamming that kept us
from getting through to our planes?

979
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,231
I do not know
about thisjamming.

980
01:10:05,309 --> 01:10:06,367
I think he does.

981
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:11,439
We cannot be responsible
foryour mechanical failures.

982
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:13,346
Is it possible?
Could it have happened?

983
01:10:17,988 --> 01:10:21,082
You asked for proof, Mr. Chairman.
This could be it.

984
01:10:22,693 --> 01:10:24,786
They're arguing back and forth.

985
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:26,828
'' Don't trustyou.''

986
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:28,854
'' Have to trustyou.''

987
01:10:30,234 --> 01:10:31,326
''It's a trick.''

988
01:10:32,069 --> 01:10:34,560
We're paying for our
mutual suspicions, Mr. Chairman.

989
01:10:34,638 --> 01:10:36,936
I realize that,
but the wall must be broken.

990
01:10:37,007 --> 01:10:40,704
We have to break it down now.
We can't afford not to trust each other.

991
01:10:44,648 --> 01:10:47,139
Wejammed your radios...

992
01:10:47,217 --> 01:10:50,209
with a special device
even I did not know about.

993
01:10:51,755 --> 01:10:54,451
I suppose I must be
very proud ofour scientists.

994
01:10:55,893 --> 01:10:58,361
It was more effective
than anyone dreamed.

995
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:00,487
But why?
Why this time?

996
01:11:01,999 --> 01:11:04,399
We have computers, likeyours.

997
01:11:05,402 --> 01:11:08,894
They computed that this time
your alert might be real.

998
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:10,701
On what grounds?

999
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:15,734
Probability.
The law ofaverages.

1000
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:18,804
They have their own logic.

1001
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:23,581
It is not human, but it is positive,
so we listen.

1002
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:26,680
Will you lift thejamming so I
can talk to the group commander?

1003
01:11:29,026 --> 01:11:31,426
- Will he return on your command?
- There's a chance.

1004
01:11:32,529 --> 01:11:33,621
I'll give that order.

1005
01:11:34,698 --> 01:11:35,892
General Bogan.

1006
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:37,263
Yes, Mr. President.

1007
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,961
Put me through
to Group Six, fast.

1008
01:11:39,036 --> 01:11:40,401
Right away, sir.

1009
01:11:41,405 --> 01:11:43,896
- What's thegroup commander'sname?
- ColonelJack Grady, sir.

1010
01:11:43,974 --> 01:11:46,340
- Does he have a wife?
- I'll see, sir.

1011
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:48,537
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One.
Can you hear me?

1012
01:11:49,379 --> 01:11:51,472
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One.
Can you hear me?

1013
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:54,208
- Yes, sir, he does.
- Findher.

1014
01:11:54,284 --> 01:11:55,945
IfI can't persuade him,
maybe she can.

1015
01:11:56,019 --> 01:11:58,783
- Yes, sir.
- Turkey One, can you hear me?

1016
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,983
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One,
Can you hear me?

1017
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:03,424
I have an important message.
Turkey One, can you hear me?

1018
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:10,295
Turkey One, canyouhearme?

1019
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:12,927
Turkey One, canyouhearme?
This is Ultimate One.

1020
01:12:13,003 --> 01:12:14,561
They've stoppedjamming us.

1021
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:19,006
This is Turkey One. I am not
authorized to receive messages.

1022
01:12:19,076 --> 01:12:23,479
Colonel Grady, this is
the president ofthe United States.

1023
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:27,176
The mission you are flying has been
triggered by a mechanical failure.

1024
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:29,116
Itisamistake.

1025
01:12:29,186 --> 01:12:31,120
Iorderyou
andthe otherplanes...

1026
01:12:31,188 --> 01:12:32,655
to return at once.

1027
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,657
Doyou hear? At once!

1028
01:12:36,827 --> 01:12:39,261
Colonel Grady, I repeat.
This is the president.

1029
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:42,196
I can no longer receive
tactical alterations byvoice.

1030
01:12:42,266 --> 01:12:43,528
I know that, but--

1031
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,194
Whatyou're telling me, I've been
specifically ordered not to do!

1032
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:48,261
Damn it, Grady,
this is the president!

1033
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:02,749
He's still on, sir.

1034
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,626
Mr. Chairman,
I think it would be wise...

1035
01:13:15,699 --> 01:13:17,792
foryou to removeyourself
from Moscow...

1036
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:20,462
so thatyou'll be
out ofdanger.

1037
01:13:20,537 --> 01:13:23,199
It will allow us
to continue negotiations...

1038
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:25,264
even ifthe worst happens.

1039
01:13:27,177 --> 01:13:30,010
I have made those arrangements.
His voice is tougher.

1040
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:36,542
Unfortunately,
we cannot remove Moscow.

1041
01:13:38,822 --> 01:13:40,813
It remains here,
open toyour bombs...

1042
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:42,324
and when it is destroyed...

1043
01:13:43,694 --> 01:13:46,527
it's people dead because there's
no time to evacuate them...

1044
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:50,730
where shall we negotiate,
Mr. President?

1045
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,770
Shall I come to Geneva, hat in hand,
begging for peace?

1046
01:13:53,837 --> 01:13:56,032
I offered you help.
You refused it.

1047
01:13:56,106 --> 01:13:58,734
I offer it again. We will helpyou
shoot down the planes.

1048
01:14:02,412 --> 01:14:04,073
Set upyour conference line.

1049
01:14:04,147 --> 01:14:06,615
I'll come back on the phone
when I'm a safe distance from Moscow.

1050
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:11,253
Activate the Ultimate One/Red One
Touch Phone, please.

1051
01:14:15,092 --> 01:14:16,821
Can we stop them, sir?

1052
01:14:34,611 --> 01:14:36,670
Fire. Fire.

1053
01:14:36,747 --> 01:14:39,477
Before he gets off
one ofthose slow ones.

1054
01:14:39,549 --> 01:14:43,952
Colonel, knock that off, or I'll
haveyou taken out ofthis room.

1055
01:14:54,197 --> 01:14:56,961
Two down.
Four to go.

1056
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:17,078
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

1057
01:15:17,154 --> 01:15:19,588
Every minute we wait
works against us.

1058
01:15:19,656 --> 01:15:20,918
Now, Mr. Secretary.

1059
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:24,620
Now is when we must send in
a first strike.

1060
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:27,026
We don't go in
for sneak attacks.

1061
01:15:27,097 --> 01:15:29,327
We had that done to us
at Pearl Harbor.

1062
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,833
And theJapanese
were right to do it.

1063
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,929
From their point ofview,
we were their mortal enemy.

1064
01:15:36,006 --> 01:15:39,100
As long as we existed,
we were a deadly threat to them.

1065
01:15:39,176 --> 01:15:42,304
Their only mistake was that
they failed to finish us at the start...

1066
01:15:42,379 --> 01:15:44,370
and they paid for that mistake
at Hiroshima.

1067
01:15:44,448 --> 01:15:46,780
You're talking about
a different kind ofwar.

1068
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:50,479
Exactly. This time,
we can finish what we start.

1069
01:15:50,554 --> 01:15:52,613
And ifwe act right now...

1070
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:54,623
our casualties will be minimal.

1071
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:56,318
Doyou know whatyou're saying?

1072
01:16:00,997 --> 01:16:03,989
Doyou believe that Communism
is not our mortal enemy?

1073
01:16:04,067 --> 01:16:06,433
You'rejustifying murder.

1074
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:09,563
Yes, to keep from being murdered.

1075
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:12,802
In the name ofwhat?
To preserve what?

1076
01:16:12,876 --> 01:16:17,210
Even ifwe do survive, what are we,
better than what we say they are?

1077
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,111
What gives us the right to live, then?

1078
01:16:19,182 --> 01:16:21,241
What makes us worth surviving,
Groteschele?

1079
01:16:21,318 --> 01:16:23,149
That we are ruthless enough
to strike first?

1080
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,653
Yes!

1081
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:30,422
Those who can survive
are the only ones worth surviving.

1082
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:32,485
Fighting foryour life
isn't the same as murder.

1083
01:16:32,562 --> 01:16:35,429
Where doyou draw the line
onceyou know what the enemy is?

1084
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:37,694
How long would the Nazis
have kept it up...

1085
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:40,668
ifeveryJew they came after
had met them with a gun in his hand?

1086
01:16:40,737 --> 01:16:44,867
But I learned from them, General Black.
Oh, I learned.

1087
01:16:44,941 --> 01:16:47,569
You learned too well, Professor.

1088
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:49,635
You learned so well that now
there's no difference...

1089
01:16:49,713 --> 01:16:51,704
between you
and whatyou want to kill.

1090
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:17,172
Yes, Mr. President.

1091
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,835
Contact our ambassador
to Moscow.

1092
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:25,508
Also the Soviet delegate
to the United Nations.

1093
01:17:25,582 --> 01:17:27,573
Hook them onto my line.

1094
01:17:28,718 --> 01:17:30,709
When the Soviet premier
comes back on the phone...

1095
01:17:30,787 --> 01:17:32,846
put us all on together.

1096
01:17:32,923 --> 01:17:34,481
Yes, Mr. President.

1097
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:36,583
Is the Touch Phone open
between Omaha...

1098
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,594
and the Soviet
command headquarters?

1099
01:17:38,662 --> 01:17:40,653
- Yes, sir, allready.
- Keep it open.

1100
01:17:54,411 --> 01:17:55,400
General Black.

1101
01:17:57,314 --> 01:17:58,406
Yes, Mr. President.

1102
01:18:02,285 --> 01:18:03,843
Rememberyour Old Testament?

1103
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:06,014
A little.

1104
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:09,950
Remember the story
ofthe sacrifice ofAbraham?

1105
01:18:10,026 --> 01:18:12,961
Old what's-his-name
used to use it in chapel...

1106
01:18:13,029 --> 01:18:15,020
at least twice a year.

1107
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,528
I remember, sir.

1108
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:22,333
Keep it in mind
the next few hours.

1109
01:18:22,405 --> 01:18:23,531
I need your help.

1110
01:18:25,342 --> 01:18:27,105
Getout toAndrews Field
rightaway.

1111
01:18:27,177 --> 01:18:29,168
Orders will be
waiting foryou there.

1112
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:30,971
Yes, sir.

1113
01:18:32,315 --> 01:18:34,943
Blackie, are Katherine
and the kids in New York?

1114
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,009
Yes, sir.

1115
01:18:39,956 --> 01:18:41,981
I may be asking
a great deal ofyou.

1116
01:18:45,395 --> 01:18:46,726
I'll do whateveryou say.

1117
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:52,932
Good luck, Blackie.

1118
01:18:54,738 --> 01:18:56,399
General Bogan.

1119
01:18:56,473 --> 01:18:57,963
Yes, Mr. President?

1120
01:18:58,041 --> 01:19:00,441
I've activated the Touch Phone
between you and the Soviet command.

1121
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:02,637
- Will you test it, please?
- Yes, sir.

1122
01:19:35,745 --> 01:19:39,340
This is General Bogan,
Strategic Air Command, Omaha.

1123
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:41,782
Iam the translator
forMarshalNevsky.

1124
01:19:43,453 --> 01:19:45,546
MarshalNevsky

1125
01:19:47,424 --> 01:19:48,584
The same to him.

1126
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:51,855
Ourreceptionis five-by-five.
Howdoyoureadus?

1127
01:19:51,928 --> 01:19:53,987
We read you five-by-five.

1128
01:19:54,064 --> 01:19:56,259
One moment, please.
Mr. President...

1129
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,322
we're through to them.

1130
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,389
Thankyou, General.

1131
01:19:58,468 --> 01:20:01,631
Put me on your public address system
so everyone can hearwhat I say.

1132
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:03,696
I want the Russians to be able
to hear as well.

1133
01:20:03,773 --> 01:20:04,831
Yes, sir.

1134
01:20:05,608 --> 01:20:06,700
Ready, sir.

1135
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:15,984
Gentlemen, this is the president
ofthe United States.

1136
01:20:17,721 --> 01:20:20,713
Whatever orders I give
to American personnel...

1137
01:20:21,891 --> 01:20:24,826
are to be considered direct orders
from the commander in chief.

1138
01:20:25,962 --> 01:20:28,624
They are to be obeyed fully...

1139
01:20:28,698 --> 01:20:31,633
without reservation
and at once.

1140
01:20:32,969 --> 01:20:34,800
Wemustdo
everything we can...

1141
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:37,635
topreventourplanes
from attacking Moscow.

1142
01:20:39,342 --> 01:20:42,470
TheSovietpremierhasbehaved
as Ibelieve I would...

1143
01:20:42,545 --> 01:20:44,604
undersimilarconditions.

1144
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,906
Hehas delayedretaliation.

1145
01:20:46,983 --> 01:20:50,248
I think he believes
this is an accident...

1146
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:55,019
but we must convince him
and his chiefadvisors that it is.

1147
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:59,493
I therefore order
everyAmerican...

1148
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,359
to cooperate fully...

1149
01:21:01,431 --> 01:21:02,898
withSovietofficers...

1150
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,835
inshooting down
ourinvadingplanes.

1151
01:21:08,705 --> 01:21:11,697
Youare togive
whateverinformation theyrequest.

1152
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:17,035
Anyhesitation,
any withholdingofinformation...

1153
01:21:18,348 --> 01:21:20,543
can have
the most tragic consequences.

1154
01:21:21,818 --> 01:21:24,082
I cannot emphasize this
too strongly.

1155
01:21:26,322 --> 01:21:27,380
Are there any questions?

1156
01:21:30,627 --> 01:21:33,994
Gentlemen, I expectyou
to conductyourselves as patriots...

1157
01:21:36,566 --> 01:21:38,591
and I wish you success.

1158
01:21:44,874 --> 01:21:46,705
Do themissiles on thesebombers...

1159
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:50,075

1160

Isitpossible?

1164
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,946
Colonel Cascio
will answeryour question.

1165
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,821
Answer the question, Colonel.

1166
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,821
That is a direct order.

1167
01:22:08,898 --> 01:22:10,525
An order, Colonel!

1168
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:13,496
Colonel!

1169
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:16,897
Just a moment, please.

1170
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:17,962
Major Handel.

1171
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,142
GeneralBogan--

1172
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:26,206
Sergeant Collins, on the double!

1173
01:22:29,352 --> 01:22:31,343
You're backup man
on fire control, aren'tyou?

1174
01:22:31,421 --> 01:22:32,410
Yes, sir.

1175
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:35,981
Do ourVindicator missiles have both
infrared- and radar-seeking capacity?

1176
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:39,359
Yes, sir.

1177
01:22:39,429 --> 01:22:41,954
Loud and clear! They've got
to know we're on the level!

1178
01:22:44,634 --> 01:22:47,102
It has both capacities, sir.

1179
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,195
Can theradar-seekingmechanism
be overloaded...

1180
01:22:49,272 --> 01:22:51,365
byincreasing
thestrength ofthesignal?

1181
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:53,266
Tell them!

1182
01:22:55,011 --> 01:22:56,239
Yes, sir.

1183
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,212
It can be overloaded...

1184
01:23:00,483 --> 01:23:02,417
but by increasing the power output...

1185
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:05,818
and sliding through radar frequencies
as fast as possible...

1186
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:08,847
what happens is
the firing mechanism...

1187
01:23:08,925 --> 01:23:12,918
reads the higher amperage
as proximity to the target...

1188
01:23:12,996 --> 01:23:15,089
and detonates the warhead.

1189
01:23:19,068 --> 01:23:20,592
Thankyou, GeneralBogan.

1190
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:22,535
We willbeback toyou.

1191
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:25,239
That's all, Sergeant.

1192
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:44,317
What does it mean?

1193
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:47,329
We've told them how to blow up
our air-to-air missiles...

1194
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:51,959
and with them, our planes.

1195
01:24:00,543 --> 01:24:02,067
They're picking us up.

1196
01:24:03,546 --> 01:24:06,709
Thomas, send out the code
for the alternate flight plan.

1197
01:24:06,783 --> 01:24:08,808
We're going down to the floor.

1198
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:30,168
They're trying to avoid the fighters
by going too low for their radar.

1199
01:24:35,345 --> 01:24:37,313
I'm sorry, General, I--

1200
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,144
I don't know what happened.
I just couldn't do it.

1201
01:24:40,216 --> 01:24:42,207
It was like a--
I don't know, a fit or something.

1202
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:43,513
Colonel, I--

1203
01:24:45,888 --> 01:24:47,116
Forget it.

1204
01:24:49,692 --> 01:24:51,751
Who could have expected
this situation?

1205
01:24:53,196 --> 01:24:54,720
General, I--

1206
01:24:55,898 --> 01:24:58,059
I think this is all a trap.

1207
01:24:59,502 --> 01:25:01,493
Theywanted this to happen.

1208
01:25:02,872 --> 01:25:05,602
We know they've been trying
to foul up our fail-safe signal.

1209
01:25:06,876 --> 01:25:11,506
I thinkwe should tell
the president it's a trap.

1210
01:25:11,581 --> 01:25:13,981
They'rejust using the time
to get their missiles ready...

1211
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:16,041
and fly their bombers
into position.

1212
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:18,053
We have no evidence ofthat.

1213
01:25:18,121 --> 01:25:20,885
They could be flying their bombers
in the grass.

1214
01:25:20,957 --> 01:25:22,891
They could have
fired missiles already...

1215
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:25,018
and put them up in the orbit
ofknown satellites...

1216
01:25:25,094 --> 01:25:26,618
where we couldn't detect them.

1217
01:25:26,696 --> 01:25:29,756
We computed that problem. Satellites
could be used to mask missiles.

1218
01:25:29,832 --> 01:25:31,925
We computed
a lot ofproblems.

1219
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:34,469
I'm not reporting anything
I don't know for sure.

1220
01:25:36,539 --> 01:25:38,666
I thinkwe should recommend
a full-strength attack.

1221
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:40,732
That is not our decision!
The Pentagon--

1222
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:43,745
They don't know what we know.
They're not soldiers anymore.

1223
01:25:43,813 --> 01:25:46,043
They're politicians.

1224
01:25:46,115 --> 01:25:48,140
They don't care
what happens to us.

1225
01:25:49,452 --> 01:25:52,114
They make a mistake,
that's politics.

1226
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:54,816
They send out men
to be killed. Forwhat?

1227
01:25:56,092 --> 01:25:58,458
To make some lousy deal,
to sell us out.

1228
01:25:59,996 --> 01:26:02,362
Save the world, save us.

1229
01:26:02,432 --> 01:26:04,957
Save our country
before they destroy it...

1230
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:07,025
with their stinking politics.

1231
01:26:08,104 --> 01:26:11,267
Order a first strike, General.
Put an end to it once and for all.

1232
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:13,331
You have the power.
You can do it!

1233
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:14,569
Colonel!

1234
01:26:15,745 --> 01:26:19,681
You are talking treason. Stop it now,
or I'll haveyou put under arrest.

1235
01:26:20,983 --> 01:26:23,281
GeneralBogan,
this is MarshalNevsky.

1236
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:25,013
Yes, Marshal.

1237
01:26:25,088 --> 01:26:26,919
Canyougive us
thelongitudeandlatitude...

1238
01:26:26,989 --> 01:26:28,479
ofthe threeremainingplanes.

1239
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:30,355
Yes, but we can't giveyou
their altitude.

1240
01:26:30,426 --> 01:26:32,485
The signals we're getting
are too distorted.

1241
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:34,996
Willyoupleasegive us
theposition ofthe threeplanes?

1242
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:37,032
We can fly fighters
at variousaltitudes.

1243
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,362
Can do.

1244
01:26:40,269 --> 01:26:42,703
Gentlemen, I am taking over
command ofthis post...

1245
01:26:42,772 --> 01:26:45,366
at the specific order
ofthe president ofthe United States.

1246
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:48,069
He has long been aware that
General Bogan is mentally unbalanced...

1247
01:26:48,144 --> 01:26:50,135
and has warned me
to observe him closely.

1248
01:26:50,213 --> 01:26:52,545
The negotiations which General Bogan
has been conducting with the enemy...

1249
01:26:52,615 --> 01:26:54,378
are the acts ofa lunatic.

1250
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,509
By the direct authority
ofthe president...

1251
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:59,111
I now command you
to take all orders from--

1252
01:26:59,188 --> 01:27:02,282
Colonel?
We got orders, Colonel.

1253
01:27:02,358 --> 01:27:04,349
You make a fuss, we'll kill you.

1254
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:07,287
You're a traitor.

1255
01:27:07,363 --> 01:27:09,695
You're worse than anybody.

1256
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:11,927
You wear the uniform.
You have men underyour command.

1257
01:27:12,001 --> 01:27:15,368
You're in the field, butyou want them
dead before they find you out!

1258
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:17,338
You want me dead!

1259
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:19,897
I saw it this morning
when you found me with those people.

1260
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:25,109
I'm better than you are!

1261
01:27:27,683 --> 01:27:29,150
It's a mistake!

1262
01:27:30,052 --> 01:27:33,488
You're betraying us all!
You're making a mistake!

1263
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:37,718
I'm better than you are.
You're a traitor.

1264
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:40,092
You're betraying us all!

1265
01:27:50,973 --> 01:27:52,167
Marshal Nevsky?

1266
01:27:52,241 --> 01:27:53,435
Yes, sir.

1267
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,737
I am prepared to giveyou
the longitude and latitude...

1268
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:59,304
ofour bombers
in accordance with your request.

1269
01:27:59,382 --> 01:28:02,010
I wasaware ofyour difficulty,
GeneralBogan.

1270
01:28:02,084 --> 01:28:04,177
Wehavehad
suchproblems ourselves.

1271
01:28:04,253 --> 01:28:05,686
Iawaityourinformation.

1272
01:28:05,755 --> 01:28:07,245
Major Handel.

1273
01:28:19,302 --> 01:28:20,963
General,
you better have a doctor--

1274
01:28:21,037 --> 01:28:22,800
They've got another one.

1275
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:27,373
Sit down, anyway.
That was a bad knock.

1276
01:28:30,947 --> 01:28:33,279
Anyone could crack
under the strain.

1277
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:35,442
Ifyou ask me,
he was on the edge--

1278
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:37,509
He was a good soldier.

1279
01:28:47,663 --> 01:28:49,858
TheSovietpremier
is comingback on theline, sir.

1280
01:28:49,932 --> 01:28:52,162
Theambassadorand
theSovietdelegatearealreadyon.

1281
01:28:52,235 --> 01:28:54,726
- Have they been told?
- Yes, sir, asyousaid.

1282
01:28:54,804 --> 01:28:55,896
Good.

1283
01:28:57,573 --> 01:28:58,972
Jay, where areyou?

1284
01:28:59,041 --> 01:29:01,566
On the top floor ofthe embassy
in Moscow, Mr. President.

1285
01:29:01,644 --> 01:29:03,168
Where areyou, Mr. Lentov?

1286
01:29:03,246 --> 01:29:05,339
In the U.N. building in New York.

1287
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:10,683
I suppose there is a reason...

1288
01:29:10,753 --> 01:29:14,086
foryour ambassador
and Comrade Lentov tojoin us.

1289
01:29:14,156 --> 01:29:16,124
There is, Mr. Chairman.

1290
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:19,418
Then let's get on with it.

1291
01:29:20,796 --> 01:29:24,630
His voice is firmer, sir.
Final.

1292
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,429
Like he's made up his mind.

1293
01:29:28,437 --> 01:29:31,429
In a few minutes,
the bombs may be falling.

1294
01:29:34,076 --> 01:29:37,136
I have brought our forces
to a condition offull readiness.

1295
01:29:39,482 --> 01:29:42,645
Unless we can satisfy one another,
I must release those forces.

1296
01:29:43,719 --> 01:29:45,846
What doyou propose,
Mr. President?

1297
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:49,551
Doyour people think there is still
a chance ofbringing down the bombers?

1298
01:29:52,528 --> 01:29:54,996
There is always a chance.

1299
01:29:55,064 --> 01:29:57,055
But I'm asking you,
what ifthey cannot?

1300
01:29:59,535 --> 01:30:00,695
What will you do?

1301
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,136
Haveyou made a decision?

1302
01:30:03,205 --> 01:30:04,832
Yes.

1303
01:30:06,242 --> 01:30:09,700
It's my decision,
and I take full responsibility.

1304
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:12,169
Mr. Swenson...

1305
01:30:12,248 --> 01:30:13,875
areyouon theline?

1306
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,076
Yes, Mr. President.

1307
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:17,312
- GeneralBogan?
- Yes, sir.

1308
01:30:19,422 --> 01:30:23,825
This is what will happen ifeven one
ofthe bombers gets through.

1309
01:30:23,893 --> 01:30:28,728
It will drop two
20-megaton bombs on Moscow.

1310
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,959
-Jay?
- Yes, Mr. President?

1311
01:30:31,033 --> 01:30:33,399
You might hear
the sound ofthe engines...

1312
01:30:33,469 --> 01:30:35,403
just before the bombs drop,
maybe not.

1313
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:38,736
In any case, you'll hear
the defensive missiles going off.

1314
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,538
Right after that,
the bombs will explode.

1315
01:30:42,745 --> 01:30:45,043
I'm told that what we will hear
at this end...

1316
01:30:45,114 --> 01:30:47,844
will be a high, shrill sound.

1317
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:51,042
That will be
the ambassador's phone...

1318
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,111
melting from the heat
ofthe fireball.

1319
01:30:54,557 --> 01:30:56,684
When we hear that sound...

1320
01:30:58,394 --> 01:31:00,624
the ambassadorwill be dead.

1321
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:03,495
Youunderstand,
Mr. Ambassador...

1322
01:31:03,566 --> 01:31:05,727
you're tostay
exactly whereyouare.

1323
01:31:05,801 --> 01:31:07,826
Yes, Mr. President.

1324
01:31:07,903 --> 01:31:09,461
He's got to attack.

1325
01:31:11,173 --> 01:31:12,606
Is this your proposal?

1326
01:31:14,176 --> 01:31:17,077
To sacrifice one American
for five million Russians?

1327
01:31:17,146 --> 01:31:19,444
No, no, listen to me!

1328
01:31:21,717 --> 01:31:25,346
I've ordered a Vindicator bomber
into the air from Washington.

1329
01:31:25,421 --> 01:31:28,720
In a few minutes, it will be
flying over New York City.

1330
01:31:28,791 --> 01:31:31,885
It is carrying two
20-megaton bombs.

1331
01:31:32,962 --> 01:31:35,430
The moment I know
that Moscow has been hit...

1332
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,801
I will order that plane
to drop its bombs.

1333
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:42,861
It will use the Empire State Building
for ground zero.

1334
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:47,300
When we hear the shriek
of Mr. Lentov's phone melting...

1335
01:31:50,212 --> 01:31:52,806
we will know that he is gone...

1336
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:55,146
and with him, New York.

1337
01:31:57,653 --> 01:31:58,677
Holy Mother ofGod.

1338
01:31:59,422 --> 01:32:00,684
No.

1339
01:32:03,192 --> 01:32:04,887
He can't do it.

1340
01:32:06,662 --> 01:32:08,323
What else can he do?

1341
01:32:11,033 --> 01:32:14,059
I don't know any otherway,
Mr. Chairman, unless--

1342
01:32:16,105 --> 01:32:18,630
unless you feel
the offer itselfis enough.

1343
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:21,175
Showing our intentions.

1344
01:32:23,879 --> 01:32:25,471
Would you think it enough?

1345
01:32:27,116 --> 01:32:30,574
If Russian bombers
were flying against New York...

1346
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:36,024
could you accept
only my good intentions?

1347
01:32:37,526 --> 01:32:38,993
No.

1348
01:32:40,196 --> 01:32:42,130
I believe
this was an accident.

1349
01:32:44,467 --> 01:32:46,628
But I also believe
your action...

1350
01:32:46,702 --> 01:32:48,693
is the onlyway out.

1351
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:53,932
I askyou to believe
I wish it were not so.

1352
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:56,869
Yes.

1353
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:01,343
We can still hope
I won't have to take that action.

1354
01:33:26,842 --> 01:33:28,173
How close to target?

1355
01:33:29,745 --> 01:33:31,144
Fourteen minutes, sir.

1356
01:33:31,213 --> 01:33:33,204
How many planes left?

1357
01:33:33,282 --> 01:33:35,273
Just us and number six.

1358
01:33:39,688 --> 01:33:40,746
Flynn.

1359
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:42,752
Stillhere, Grady.

1360
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:44,816
What's your condition?

1361
01:33:44,894 --> 01:33:47,226
Slight wing damage
from ordinary flak. That'sall.

1362
01:33:47,296 --> 01:33:49,389
Speeddown to 1350.
Drageven.

1363
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:52,629
How many decoys
doyou have left?

1364
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:54,692
Howmany doyouneed?

1365
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:56,795
Well, I got the bombs.
You don't.

1366
01:33:56,872 --> 01:33:59,864
I wantyou to take some
ofthose fighters offmy tail.

1367
01:33:59,942 --> 01:34:01,807
- Will do.
- Billy?

1368
01:34:01,877 --> 01:34:03,071
Yeah?

1369
01:34:04,046 --> 01:34:05,604
I depend on you.

1370
01:34:10,686 --> 01:34:13,280
GeneralBogan, canyou
explain thismaneuver?

1371
01:34:13,355 --> 01:34:14,982
One ofyourplanes
hasjustappearedagain.

1372
01:34:15,057 --> 01:34:17,457
It's standard procedure,
Marshal Nevsky.

1373
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:20,324
That's our number six plane,
the decoy plane.

1374
01:34:20,396 --> 01:34:22,728
It's trying to drawyour fighters
away from our other plane...

1375
01:34:22,798 --> 01:34:23,787
carrying the bombs.

1376
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,333
Isee.

1377
01:34:25,401 --> 01:34:28,336
It carries only defensive equipment.
You don't have to worry about it.

1378
01:34:28,404 --> 01:34:31,669
Thankyou. Weshall try
forakillinany case.

1379
01:34:32,808 --> 01:34:36,107
You'll scatteryour forces.
You don't have time for that.

1380
01:34:38,647 --> 01:34:43,016
I tell you, it doesn't carry any bombs.
You don't have to worry about it!

1381
01:34:45,754 --> 01:34:47,688
You're letting
our other plane get through!

1382
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:55,154
I told you!

1383
01:34:58,167 --> 01:34:59,634
Therehasbeena--

1384
01:35:00,369 --> 01:35:02,462
MarshalNevskyhas collapsed.

1385
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:06,667
Itappears--
Well, Idon'tknow.

1386
01:35:07,843 --> 01:35:09,868
GeneralKoniev
isnowin command.

1387
01:35:11,447 --> 01:35:12,709
Bogan, what's happened?

1388
01:35:12,781 --> 01:35:17,343
Marshal Nevsky sent his fighters
after a plane that carried no bombs.

1389
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:22,220
That means our number one plane
will almost certainly get through.

1390
01:35:22,291 --> 01:35:25,988
Themarshalrealizedthat.
It was toomuch forhim.

1391
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:28,256
GeneralBogan,
this is GeneralKoniev.

1392
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:30,321
Doyouhave theremainingplane
onyourscreen?

1393
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:31,832
No, sir, we do not.

1394
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:34,733
We cannotseeiton ourradar,
anditis flyingso fast...

1395
01:35:34,803 --> 01:35:36,464
ourantiaircraftis useless.

1396
01:35:36,538 --> 01:35:38,733
Imustassume
theplane willget through.

1397
01:35:38,807 --> 01:35:40,638
- Yes.
- Iintendto focus...

1398
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:43,803
allourremaining rockets
on the estimatedpath oftheplane...

1399
01:35:43,879 --> 01:35:45,870
andfire them alloffatonce.

1400
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:49,042
Ourhopeis tosetup
a thermonuclearbarrier...

1401
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,109
thatnothing canpenetrate.

1402
01:35:51,186 --> 01:35:53,381
That might work.
It's worth a chance.

1403
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:08,270
You speak English
verywell, General.

1404
01:36:08,337 --> 01:36:11,602
I was liaison toyourheadquarters
in London during the war.

1405
01:36:13,075 --> 01:36:15,066
I was stationed
right outside of London.

1406
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:19,205
Yes, Iknow.
With the 8thAir Force.

1407
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:21,112
Did you like London?

1408
01:36:22,618 --> 01:36:23,983
Verymuch.

1409
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:28,251
So did I.

1410
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:32,127
Thegreatcitiesare those
where one can walk.

1411
01:36:33,395 --> 01:36:35,727
I would walk
all the timein London.

1412
01:36:35,798 --> 01:36:37,732
Whereveryou turn,
there'shistory.

1413
01:36:39,835 --> 01:36:42,395
General, areyou in Moscow now?

1414
01:36:42,471 --> 01:36:43,563
No.

1415
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:46,766
I was orderedtoleave.

1416
01:36:46,842 --> 01:36:48,537
Is your--

1417
01:36:54,116 --> 01:36:55,606
It's a hard day.

1418
01:36:58,253 --> 01:36:59,481
Yes, ahardday.

1419
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:03,755
Good-bye, my friend.

1420
01:37:05,227 --> 01:37:06,854
Good-bye, my friend.

1421
01:37:10,132 --> 01:37:12,225
- Colonel Grady, sir.
- What is it, Thomas?

1422
01:37:12,301 --> 01:37:13,325
The infrared indicator...

1423
01:37:13,402 --> 01:37:16,132
shows a large number ofground-to-air
rockets ignited ahead ofus.

1424
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:17,832
They should show on the scope soon.

1425
01:37:17,906 --> 01:37:20,136
What doyou know
about those rockets?

1426
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:21,801
They're no different
from ours, sir.

1427
01:37:21,877 --> 01:37:23,936
Designed to home in
on heat-producing engines...

1428
01:37:24,012 --> 01:37:25,775
like an airplane.

1429
01:37:26,749 --> 01:37:29,183
They can't be aiming at us. We're
too low. They'd blow themselves up.

1430
01:37:29,251 --> 01:37:31,276
What are they doing
with them?

1431
01:37:32,855 --> 01:37:34,254
- GeneralBogan?
- Yes.

1432
01:37:34,323 --> 01:37:36,814
They foundMrs. Grady.
She'sstanding by.

1433
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:38,325
Mr. President.

1434
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:40,453
- Wehave Grady's wife.
- Can we get through to him?

1435
01:37:40,529 --> 01:37:43,760
Ifhe follows procedure, he'll contact
us when he within range ofthe target.

1436
01:37:43,832 --> 01:37:46,130
Those are his orders so that we know
how to evaluate the strike.

1437
01:37:46,201 --> 01:37:49,261
- He's been following orders so far.
- Yes, sir.

1438
01:37:49,338 --> 01:37:50,828
Keepyour fingers crossed.

1439
01:37:51,907 --> 01:37:53,431
- Thomas.
- Yes, sir.

1440
01:37:54,543 --> 01:37:56,374
Would their rockets
follow missiles too?

1441
01:37:56,445 --> 01:37:58,709
I don't see why not.
A missile produces heat.

1442
01:37:59,648 --> 01:38:01,411
I think I know
what they're gonna do.

1443
01:38:01,483 --> 01:38:05,078
Explode the rockets on top ofus,
hope to knock us down with a blast.

1444
01:38:05,154 --> 01:38:07,384
They can do it too. How many
air-to-air missiles are left?

1445
01:38:07,456 --> 01:38:08,616
Two.

1446
01:38:09,591 --> 01:38:12,424
The minuteyou see those rockets
ignite on the scope...

1447
01:38:12,494 --> 01:38:15,861
you fire our missiles and guide them
for maximum elevation straight up.

1448
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:16,955
Straight up.

1449
01:38:17,032 --> 01:38:18,863
Yeah. Maybe their rockets
will follow the missiles...

1450
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:20,663
explode too high to hurt us.

1451
01:38:20,736 --> 01:38:21,998
Yes, sir.

1452
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:26,335
Colonel Grady, we're in range.
We have to report in.

1453
01:38:26,408 --> 01:38:28,035
Watch that scope.

1454
01:38:30,012 --> 01:38:32,412
Ultimate One,
this is Turkey One.

1455
01:38:32,481 --> 01:38:34,745
- Canyouhearme?
- Grady, this is General Bogan.

1456
01:38:34,817 --> 01:38:38,514
Keep receiving no matterwhatyou hear.
Doyou understand? Keep receiving.

1457
01:38:38,587 --> 01:38:40,748
Jack.

1458
01:38:40,823 --> 01:38:42,154
This is Helen.

1459
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:43,847
It's Helen.

1460
01:38:43,926 --> 01:38:45,860
Doyou recognize myvoice?

1461
01:38:45,928 --> 01:38:47,759
It'snota trick.

1462
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:49,024
It's me.

1463
01:38:49,097 --> 01:38:52,032
Jack, youmust turnback.

1464
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,068
Youmustn'tdrop thosebombs.

1465
01:38:54,136 --> 01:38:56,195
- Doyou hear me?
- Is it reallyyourwife?

1466
01:38:57,172 --> 01:38:59,333
They've started their rockets.

1467
01:38:59,408 --> 01:39:01,342
Fire one.

1468
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:03,002
Doyouhear whatI'msaying?

1469
01:39:03,645 --> 01:39:05,340
Fire two.

1470
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:10,245
Keep them at least 2,500 feet
above the rockets.

1471
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:13,447
- Yes, sir.
-Jack--

1472
01:39:13,522 --> 01:39:16,082
There's no war!
We're fine!

1473
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,427
You must turn back!

1474
01:39:20,295 --> 01:39:21,762
They're at 1 8,000.

1475
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:24,765
- Go! Go!
- Nineteen.

1476
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:27,461
- 20,000 feet.
- The rockets are following them!

1477
01:39:27,536 --> 01:39:29,470
Boost them as much as you can.
The higher, the better.

1478
01:39:29,538 --> 01:39:31,631
I've never lied toyou, have I?

1479
01:39:31,707 --> 01:39:34,870
- 50,000.
- I couldn't, no matterwhat.

1480
01:39:34,943 --> 01:39:36,877
You'vegot tobelieveme!

1481
01:39:36,945 --> 01:39:38,640
80,000 feet.

1482
01:39:38,714 --> 01:39:41,444
Ninety. A hundred.

1483
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:44,748
- They're slowing down.
- 1 30,000. 1 40,000.

1484
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:48,415
- We'd better get some altitude.
-Jack, please, answerme!

1485
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:49,923
1 70,000!

1486
01:39:49,992 --> 01:39:54,429
Jack, doyou--
Answer me, please!

1487
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:57,397
Youcan't trustit, sir!
Wegottagetoutofhere!

1488
01:39:58,367 --> 01:39:59,664
No!

1489
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:03,228
Hang on!

1490
01:40:06,074 --> 01:40:07,632
Their rockets are catching up!

1491
01:40:07,709 --> 01:40:09,836
We're gonna catch some ofit.
Hold tight.

1492
01:40:11,346 --> 01:40:13,075
There they go.

1493
01:40:22,724 --> 01:40:24,715
Thinkwe'll make it now.

1494
01:40:26,795 --> 01:40:28,990
How many minutes to Moscow?

1495
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:30,429
Seven minutes, sir.

1496
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,434
Look...

1497
01:40:33,502 --> 01:40:37,131
we have our choice about what altitude
to drop the bombs from.

1498
01:40:37,205 --> 01:40:39,264
It's about the only choice
we do have now.

1499
01:40:41,109 --> 01:40:43,236
Blast gave us enough radiation.

1500
01:40:43,312 --> 01:40:45,780
At best we'd only last
a couple ofdays.

1501
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:50,074
So I'm taking her in low.

1502
01:40:50,953 --> 01:40:52,978
When we're over the target...

1503
01:40:53,956 --> 01:40:55,981
climbing to 5,000 feet.

1504
01:40:57,392 --> 01:40:59,553
Bombs are set to go at 5,000.

1505
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:03,597
We'll go with them.

1506
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:08,592
Okay?

1507
01:41:15,143 --> 01:41:18,203
What the hell.
There's nothing to go home to anyway.

1508
01:41:29,791 --> 01:41:33,591
General Stark, are there any papers
or documents in New York...

1509
01:41:33,662 --> 01:41:37,928
which are absolutely essential
to the running ofthe United States?

1510
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:40,799
General Stark?

1511
01:41:42,137 --> 01:41:44,071
No, sir.

1512
01:41:44,139 --> 01:41:46,869
There are
important documents, but...

1513
01:41:46,942 --> 01:41:48,933
none ofthem
absolutely essential.

1514
01:41:50,879 --> 01:41:52,870
Will there be anywarning given?

1515
01:41:53,949 --> 01:41:56,850
A lot oflives could be saved
ifpeople had a few minutes.

1516
01:41:56,918 --> 01:42:00,046
On short notice, an alert to a big city
would do more harm than good.

1517
01:42:00,122 --> 01:42:02,147
All you'd produce is panic.

1518
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:05,849
What about this?

1519
01:42:17,072 --> 01:42:18,437
Maybe--

1520
01:42:19,574 --> 01:42:21,769
Maybe he doesn't know
his wife is there.

1521
01:42:23,645 --> 01:42:24,976
He knows.

1522
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:33,344
Gentlemen, we are wasting time.

1523
01:42:35,557 --> 01:42:37,650
I've been making
a few rough calculations...

1524
01:42:37,726 --> 01:42:40,058
based on the effect
oftwo 20-megaton bombs...

1525
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:42,824
dropped on New York City
in the middle ofa normal workday.

1526
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:46,930
I estimate the immediate dead
at about three million.

1527
01:42:47,002 --> 01:42:50,096
I include in this figure those buried
beneath the collapsed buildings.

1528
01:42:51,173 --> 01:42:53,232
Wouldn't make any difference,
Admiral Wilcox...

1529
01:42:53,308 --> 01:42:55,742
whether they reached
a shelter or not.

1530
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:57,802
Theywould diejust the same.

1531
01:42:58,814 --> 01:43:02,045
Add another million or two
who'll die within about five weeks.

1532
01:43:04,486 --> 01:43:08,923
Are immediate problem would be thejoint
one offire control and excavation.

1533
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:11,754
Excavation not ofthe dead.
The effort would be wasted there.

1534
01:43:12,894 --> 01:43:15,658
Even though there are no irreplaceable
government documents in the city...

1535
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:18,461
many ofour largest corporations
keep their records there.

1536
01:43:19,601 --> 01:43:21,796
It will be necessary to...

1537
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,130
rescue as many
ofthose records as we can.

1538
01:43:33,849 --> 01:43:35,840
Our economy depends on this.

1539
01:43:41,923 --> 01:43:43,914
Our economy depends on this.

1540
01:43:51,032 --> 01:43:53,091
''And the Lord said,'' gentlemen...

1541
01:43:54,736 --> 01:43:57,227
'''he who is without sin...

1542
01:43:57,305 --> 01:43:59,296
let him cast the first stone.'''

1543
01:44:08,984 --> 01:44:10,110
Sir?

1544
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:15,780
May I have a drink, please?

1545
01:44:26,735 --> 01:44:28,726
How'd you ever get to be
a translator, Buck?

1546
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,795
You don't seem
the academic type.

1547
01:44:32,607 --> 01:44:35,633
I guess I've got
this talent for languages, sir.

1548
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:39,372
I hear a language once,
I pick it right up.

1549
01:44:40,482 --> 01:44:41,915
I don't even know how.

1550
01:44:43,952 --> 01:44:46,147
They found out
about it in the army.

1551
01:44:46,221 --> 01:44:48,155
You sound sorry they did.

1552
01:44:48,223 --> 01:44:50,248
Oh, no.
Very interestingjob.

1553
01:44:53,094 --> 01:44:55,426
I mean, sometimes.

1554
01:44:56,565 --> 01:44:58,590
Well, you did
a goodjob today, Buck.

1555
01:45:00,268 --> 01:45:01,326
Thankyou, sir.

1556
01:45:02,337 --> 01:45:04,771
All I did was repeat what he said.

1557
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,775
You didn't freeze up.
Another man might have.

1558
01:45:10,212 --> 01:45:12,203
You're the one who didn't, sir.

1559
01:45:16,751 --> 01:45:19,549
I wonderwhat it's like out.
Looked like rain before.

1560
01:45:21,823 --> 01:45:24,314
Radio said it would clear
by the afternoon.

1561
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:31,961
Thepremier, sir.

1562
01:45:33,301 --> 01:45:34,529
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

1563
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,173
Mr. President...

1564
01:45:42,978 --> 01:45:45,139
I have ordered
our long-range missiles...

1565
01:45:45,213 --> 01:45:47,204
to stand down from their alert.

1566
01:45:50,418 --> 01:45:52,978
Only that part ofour defense...

1567
01:45:53,054 --> 01:45:55,352
that has a chance
ofshooting down your bomber...

1568
01:45:56,524 --> 01:45:58,583
is still active.

1569
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:01,390
We do not think
we have much ofa chance.

1570
01:46:02,831 --> 01:46:03,820
I know.

1571
01:46:06,167 --> 01:46:09,034
And yet, this was nobody's fault.

1572
01:46:09,104 --> 01:46:10,628
I don't agree.

1573
01:46:11,973 --> 01:46:13,998
No human being did wrong.

1574
01:46:15,777 --> 01:46:17,836
No one is to be blamed.

1575
01:46:17,913 --> 01:46:19,778
We're to blame, both ofus.

1576
01:46:19,848 --> 01:46:22,442
We let our machines
get out ofhand.

1577
01:46:24,052 --> 01:46:26,953
Still, it was an accident.

1578
01:46:27,022 --> 01:46:30,890
Two great cities may be destroyed,
millions ofinnocent people killed.

1579
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:33,826
What do we say to them, Mr. Chairman?
''Accidents will happen''?

1580
01:46:33,895 --> 01:46:35,362
I won't accept that.

1581
01:46:39,234 --> 01:46:41,099
All I know...

1582
01:46:41,169 --> 01:46:43,660
is that as long
as we have weapons--

1583
01:46:43,738 --> 01:46:45,865
All I know is that men
are responsible.

1584
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:48,068
We're responsible
forwhat happens to us.

1585
01:46:49,177 --> 01:46:51,236
Todaywe had
a taste ofthe future.

1586
01:46:51,313 --> 01:46:53,941
Do we learn from it,
or do we go on the waywe have?

1587
01:46:54,015 --> 01:46:58,076
What do we do, Mr. Chairman?
What do we say to the dead?

1588
01:47:01,189 --> 01:47:03,180
I think, ifwe are men...

1589
01:47:04,459 --> 01:47:05,892
we must say...

1590
01:47:07,295 --> 01:47:09,229
this will not happen again.

1591
01:47:10,632 --> 01:47:13,157
But doyou think it possible...

1592
01:47:13,234 --> 01:47:15,259
with all that stands
between us?

1593
01:47:15,337 --> 01:47:17,897
We put it there, Mr. Chairman,
and we're not helpless.

1594
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:20,533
What we put between us,
we can remove.

1595
01:47:24,079 --> 01:47:26,070
- Mr. President?
- Yes,Jay.

1596
01:47:27,248 --> 01:47:30,809
Icanhearthesoundofexplosions
from thenortheast.

1597
01:47:30,885 --> 01:47:33,319
Theskyis verybright,
alllitup--

1598
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:53,031
Put me through
to General Black.

1599
01:48:05,653 --> 01:48:07,177
Yes, Mr. President.

1600
01:48:09,391 --> 01:48:11,222
Yes, Mr. President?

1601
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,294
Moscow's been destroyed.

1602
01:48:15,296 --> 01:48:17,287
Dropyour bombs
according to plan.

1603
01:48:18,933 --> 01:48:20,195
Yes, sir.

1604
01:48:30,078 --> 01:48:32,706
You've all been briefed on the mission,
so there's nothing more to say.

1605
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:36,941
I have only one last order.

1606
01:48:38,386 --> 01:48:43,915
Nobody else is to have anything to do
with the dropping ofthe bombs.

1607
01:48:46,261 --> 01:48:50,857
Repeat: I will fly the plane
and release the bombs.

1608
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:55,828
The final act is my own.

1609
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:58,964
On course, sir.
Approaching target.

1610
01:49:01,509 --> 01:49:03,636
Count down from ten.
Give me the signal.

1611
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:10,380
Ten, nine...

1612
01:49:10,452 --> 01:49:12,386
eight, seven...

1613
01:49:12,454 --> 01:49:14,388
six, five...

1614
01:49:14,456 --> 01:49:16,390
four, three...

1615
01:49:16,458 --> 01:49:18,289
two, one.

1616
01:49:18,359 --> 01:49:19,326
Mark.

1617
01:49:26,067 --> 01:49:28,001
General Black!

1618
01:49:28,069 --> 01:49:30,799
Katie--
The dream--

1619
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:33,539
The dream!

1620
01:49:36,744 --> 01:49:38,211
The matador.

1621
01:49:40,081 --> 01:49:41,343
The matador!

1622
01:49:43,151 --> 01:49:44,641
The matador.

1623
01:49:47,322 --> 01:49:48,653
Me!

1624
01:49:49,724 --> 01:49:50,918
Me.
