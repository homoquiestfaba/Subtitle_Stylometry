1
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:39,587
<i>We have confirmed movement</i>
<i>on the west side of the perimeter.</i>

2
00:02:40,222 --> 00:02:42,986
<i>Roger that, Dwayne.</i>
<i>What's your position?</i>

3
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:46,356
<i>Airborne in position to the south</i>
<i>of the surveillance area.</i>

4
00:02:52,802 --> 00:02:55,464
<i>We have movement from inside</i>
<i>the compound. Everyone stand by.</i>

5
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:14,517
<i>Code 1. Code 1. We have gunfire</i>
<i>on the ground from the east.</i>

6
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,089
<i>Repeat, east side.</i>

7
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,248
<i>Chopper 1 and Chopper 2,</i>
<i>we have authorization.</i>

8
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,356
<i>Take down all elements</i>
<i>within the compound.</i>

9
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:22,991
<i>Marshall, we have one escapee</i>
<i>heading your way on a motorcycle.</i>

10
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:27,590
Roger that. I have a visual.
He has turned towards the north.

11
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:30,594
<i>Air support required immediately.</i>

12
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:39,670
I have the electronic lock.
Unloading the chain gun.

13
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:46,111
<i>Suspect is still heading north.</i>
<i>Switching to rockets.</i>

14
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:48,909
<i>Gonna bring him down</i>
<i>for you to clean up, Marshall.</i>

15
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:58,019
He's down, he's down.
On foot and still heading north.

16
00:04:58,227 --> 00:05:01,253
- <i>He's all yours.</i>
- <i>Roger that.</i>

17
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:44,704
<i>Retrieving the sequencer</i>
<i>was the right thing to do.</i>

18
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:48,809
<i>However, the Majestic drug research</i>
<i>program is none of your concern.</i>

19
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:51,673
The consequences are the same,
no matter how you look at it.

20
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,542
We made the treaties,
they broke them.

21
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,546
Now you expect me
to clean up after them?

22
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:59,710
- That's not gonna happen, you hear?
- <i>Marshall, I repeat, let it go.</i>

23
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:03,957
We've received new orders, sir.

24
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,186
0800 hours to Paris.
A training mission.

25
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:09,956
Oh, well, let's go pack our gear.

26
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:13,829
Do we stand down, sir?

27
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:16,561
- That's right.
- Sir.

28
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:29,807
Well, anyway... I mean, I'm...

29
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,180
Your room keys, sir.

30
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:35,915
They come from
a really good SF team...

31
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,390
...and Admiral Morgan
recommended them as replacements.

32
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,998
They have two days' field training
before our next assignment.

33
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:45,293
They'll be all right.

34
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:49,899
Okay, children, let's go.

35
00:06:56,645 --> 00:07:01,605
So Marshall Lawson.
What do you guys know about him?

36
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:04,012
I mean, the man walks
with an air of confidence...

37
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,654
...that's rarely seen
in this day and age.

38
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:08,084
What?

39
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:10,887
What? I'm serious. He does.

40
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:14,222
Yeah, him and his girlfriend,
Dwayne.

41
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,830
There's just two things you need
to know about Lawson.

42
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,432
One is he's a bad motherfucker...

43
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:23,196
...and two, he's a bad motherfucker.

44
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:24,838
- I hear that.
- That's the truth.

45
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,706
Here's to what might could be
a real good team.

46
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:33,211
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

47
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:35,815
- Cheers.
- And if not, you can always kill us, sir.

48
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:38,248
I'm thinking about that already.

49
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:42,714
You're all about to cut your teeth now,
let me tell you something.

50
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,160
Grab a beer at the bar.
Just take it easy.

51
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:47,659
- Sir.
- Oh, take it easy?

52
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:50,354
Okay.

53
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,436
Those fucking guys have no idea
what we're up against.

54
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,237
Yeah, well, I've got a bad, bad feeling
they about to find out.

55
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:14,109
Requesting permission
to leave the premises.

56
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:17,911
- Can't get no love around here.
- We're thinking of going to a titty bar.

57
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:21,022
I ain't getting no love
and I'm too old for love.

58
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:22,918
And I'm too poor.

59
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:26,285
- Why don't you go on.
- We'll catch you later.

60
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:28,520
All right. Thank you, sir.

61
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:32,997
Just remember. Tomorrow, 0700.
Be here.

62
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:35,727
- Oh, yeah. On the dot.
- Right.

63
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,575
This place is cold. It could
freeze the balls off a penguin.

64
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:51,378
- Where the hell are we going now?
- All right.

65
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:53,214
Guys?

66
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:56,687
- Yeah.
- Oh, there, there.

67
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,961
Morning. Morning. Morning.

68
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:18,975
This is the best day of my life. Yeah!

69
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:24,542
Oh, man. All right, I love you.

70
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:27,886
- Oh, dude.
- Oh, my...

71
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,058
She's the one. She's the one.
She's the one.

72
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,556
- Hey.
- Hello.

73
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,557
Any chance? Party, later.

74
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:36,560
- We've got a party back at our hotel.
- At the hotel.

75
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:38,733
You want me to go,
you have to talk to him.

76
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:41,562
- What, talk to him?
- Yeah.

77
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,901
See you in a minute.

78
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:49,502
Can I talk to you for a minute, man?

79
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:54,711
What's your pleasure?

80
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:58,110
That girl.

81
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,881
Treat her right.

82
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,291
Okay.

83
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:07,562
And I'll send someone around
to collect.

84
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,230
Deal.

85
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,765
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

86
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,168
- We got a deal.
- Thank you.

87
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,863
- Cheers.
- Carl. Let's go.

88
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:26,210
Thanks, man.

89
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:28,510
- There you go, man.
- Thanks, man.

90
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:38,754
Thank you very much.
You've been so very kind tonight.

91
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:40,394
Thank you. We've got love.

92
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:57,703
You be all right by yourself?
All right.

93
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:22,002
- What are you doing here?
- I'm following new orders.

94
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:23,899
Just like you.

95
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:47,061
Okay.

96
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,775
Come on, guys, open the door.

97
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:46,384
Jesus, guys. Come on.

98
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:08,599
Jerk off all over the wallpaper
all night.

99
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,539
I'm up. I'm up next.

100
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:13,340
Least I can get it up next.

101
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,812
At least I can get it up
in the first place.

102
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:18,282
Honey, you're with the wrong guy.

103
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:26,155
I might not know what I'm doing,
but I can do it all night.

104
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:28,886
Come on, guys, open the door. Phil.

105
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:08,696
- All right, I'll see you in the morning.
- See you later.

106
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,269
Hey.

107
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,542
Well, let's have a look.

108
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,325
- Check it out.
- What the fuck?

109
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,368
No. Don't bother.

110
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:52,908
They're all dead.

111
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:55,606
Come with me.

112
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,590
Oh, Jesus.

113
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:16,127
Detective Lambert, <i>et vous?</i>

114
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:19,637
Yeah, I'm Commander Lawson
and this is Chief Dixon.

115
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,934
And we're all active military.

116
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,406
These are my guys.

117
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:27,104
I'm gonna have to claim the bodies
and take them in for a special autopsy.

118
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:31,308
The bodies are mine.
They are under my jurisdiction.

119
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,044
Okay. Listen to me, young man.

120
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:36,418
I'm gonna have somebody in your
government call you immediately...

121
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,991
...and explain who has jurisdiction
over these guys.

122
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:41,594
Do you hear me?
Just keep an eye on your watch.

123
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:45,324
Within about 20 minutes, you're
gonna be told who gets the bodies.

124
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:48,102
Dwayne, find that titty bar.

125
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:32,910
Thanks.

126
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:43,823
- Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:49,121
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

128
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:51,891
- What's your name?
- Reina.

129
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,193
Maybe you can help me
with something, Reina.

130
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:56,165
Some buddies of mine
were here tonight.

131
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:58,305
You see who they were
hanging with?

132
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:26,190
Can't have you upsetting the girls.

133
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,930
Just making small talk.

134
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:31,805
Why don't you make it
somewhere else?

135
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:35,501
Look, I was just asking her
a few questions.

136
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,042
I'm looking for some buddies
that were here tonight.

137
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:41,238
I'm sorry about your trouble,
but the police will take care of it.

138
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:43,849
Yeah, well, the police
ain't working fast enough.

139
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,120
I guess the police will handle it, then.

140
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:15,944
- What do you got?
- Just like you figured.

141
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:20,452
Massive physical trauma,
but also traces of a new drug, CTX.

142
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:22,282
Apparently, it's the new party drug.

143
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,288
We've had several
overdose victims recently.

144
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:07,495
What now?

145
00:20:08,937 --> 00:20:11,235
I don't know, man.
I just needed some time to think.

146
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,868
You okay?

147
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:18,978
My team, they're well-trained.

148
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:21,673
Real well-trained.

149
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:26,081
Whoever did this,
or whatever did this, they're good.

150
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:27,686
It was brutal.

151
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:29,720
Yeah, well, that might be...

152
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:32,484
...but it was an assassination,
that's for sure.

153
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:35,595
Revenge for some past operation?

154
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:40,334
Could be. I thought of that.
It could be.

155
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,730
Revenge is a two-way street.

156
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,962
I had local police
arrest the club owner.

157
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:46,868
You wanna check him out?

158
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,033
No, I'm going
to Majestic headquarters.

159
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:49,567
<i>Access denied.</i>

160
00:21:52,574 --> 00:21:55,600
ID, please. This is a restricted area.

161
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:02,774
I'm sorry, commander,
but this area is now closed...

162
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:05,350
...even to someone
with your classification.

163
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:10,558
That's very strange that they
would have pulled my clearance...

164
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,226
...and not told me about it.

165
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:15,920
Commander, I need you
to step aside.

166
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:30,073
I'm sorry, commander,
I need you to vacate the facility.

167
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,379
Yeah?

168
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:46,651
<i>Did Robinson tell you</i>
<i>why they revoked your clearance?</i>

169
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:49,256
No, not really.

170
00:22:50,732 --> 00:22:52,131
Okay. When and where?

171
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,731
Café, east side of the building.
Twenty minutes.

172
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:57,666
I'll see you there.

173
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:14,983
Didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight, Aroon?

174
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:20,156
And didn't I pay you to stop people
from looking for me, Lambert?

175
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:26,464
I can't help it if the U.S. military...

176
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:30,198
...is taking an interest
in your activities.

177
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:32,373
How was I supposed to know
that Uncle Sam...

178
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:36,340
...would send in some of his finest?
Those boys were having fun.

179
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:38,102
Yeah?

180
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,208
You know, the irony is
that Marshall and his team...

181
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,940
...weren't even looking for you.

182
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:45,642
Those boys were looking
for some R and R.

183
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:47,048
And they found it.

184
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:52,783
Your girl Reina,
she had a little too much fun.

185
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:55,792
She might have got a little
out of control, I suppose.

186
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:02,226
Well, then, it's a little
out of my jurisdiction.

187
00:24:02,437 --> 00:24:04,667
Can you get me out of here?

188
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:15,311
Lambert, this is still
a U.S. military investigation.

189
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:17,982
Just trying to help.

190
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:21,383
Get the fuck out of here before
I have your French ass kicked out.

191
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:51,648
I just heard about your team.

192
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:56,380
I'm so sorry, Marshall.

193
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:59,025
If there's anything I can do...

194
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:02,621
I really need to know who did this.

195
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:06,262
Very impressive record.

196
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:07,934
I like to think so.

197
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:11,299
Head of the biochemical research
program in Western Europe.

198
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:13,030
Top-secret research.

199
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,004
You're a top dog, Aroon.

200
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:18,111
Be all you can be.

201
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:20,907
Why not? Your partner didn't mind.

202
00:25:21,115 --> 00:25:23,777
Yes, well, Tia's a very special girl.

203
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:26,476
Besides, they'll need her
for the cover-up.

204
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:30,317
Although, if she's not careful,
they'll probably make her the fall guy.

205
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,957
We've been monitoring this area
for more than six months...

206
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:38,792
...because a top-level
Majestic researcher went AWOL.

207
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,031
Let me ask you something.

208
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:46,172
What's the story with Majestic
and drug movement?

209
00:25:46,374 --> 00:25:48,467
They control the
CTX research program...

210
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:51,338
...but Werner wants everybody
and everything to stand down...

211
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:53,514
...until we know what's going on.
Yeah?

212
00:25:54,282 --> 00:25:55,749
Hello, Robinson.

213
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,009
Listen to me,
you arrogant little prick.

214
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:01,120
I don't understand any of this
fancy research you're fucking with.

215
00:26:01,322 --> 00:26:03,256
But what I do understand is this:

216
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,756
Three of my boys got murdered
and I want to know why.

217
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,224
Wrong place, wrong time?

218
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,122
Your girl Reina was a little careless.

219
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:14,964
We found this...

220
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:17,600
...in the hotel room...

221
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:21,297
...and this in your club.

222
00:26:22,577 --> 00:26:25,603
The autopsy confirmed significant
traces of this chemical...

223
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:27,007
...in the three dead bodies.

224
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:28,807
Your boys must have liked it, then.

225
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:31,446
Listen, asshole.

226
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:33,711
I want to know what's going on
in your club.

227
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:36,116
And what's happening
to the people around here.

228
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:38,656
Are you making me an offer?

229
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,318
Sure. Either you tell me...

230
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,988
...or I shoot you so full of this shit
that it'll make you talk...

231
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,690
...or it'll kill you.

232
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:51,161
I'll handle it. Yup.

233
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:54,705
I need access to an armory.

234
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:57,469
- I'll see what I can do.
- You know the weapons I like.

235
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:02,339
I gotta deal with Robinson first.

236
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:08,549
You've no idea
who you're dealing with.

237
00:27:08,756 --> 00:27:12,852
So fucking enlighten me, because
right now you are dealing with me.

238
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:18,328
Dwayne, meet CTX.

239
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:23,495
CTX, meet Dwayne.

240
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:28,168
So how does it work, this CTX?

241
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:37,310
Could you give me five?

242
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:43,481
I have orders to shut you down.

243
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:47,183
All military drug-testing programs
have been canceled.

244
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:50,455
- lf I were to ask you why?
- You don't even need to ask.

245
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:54,157
Aroon's defection has caused
a serious breach in our CTX program.

246
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:57,360
So we're talking about
chemical warfare.

247
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,302
Chemically-induced warfare.

248
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,302
So who do you work for?

249
00:28:02,777 --> 00:28:05,837
Someone who doesn't like
a lot of questions.

250
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:11,282
She does have access to seemingly
unlimited Russian financing, though.

251
00:28:11,486 --> 00:28:15,718
And that's one of the reasons
I don't like asking a lot of questions.

252
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:18,391
Why here?

253
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:21,457
When you experiment,
you need to test.

254
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:27,133
When I was in the Army, I had access
to as many guinea pigs as I wanted.

255
00:28:28,202 --> 00:28:30,295
Soldiers. For research.

256
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:34,934
You have no idea how many soldiers
gave up their lives for science.

257
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:36,542
It was funded by the military.

258
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:39,304
Once I went AWOL,
I still had to perfect the formula...

259
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:43,280
...and that meant testing it.

260
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:45,609
On who?

261
00:28:46,721 --> 00:28:48,586
John Smith. Jane Doe.

262
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,349
Innocent people
as your guinea pigs?

263
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:55,159
It's amazing what types of corruption
you can buy these days.

264
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:57,797
We cannot get caught
in the spotlight.

265
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:00,524
But what we can do
is limit the damage.

266
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:02,760
And in a couple of months,
it'll all blow away.

267
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,597
Okay. No questions asked.

268
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:07,273
- Not by the wrong people.
- Like Marshall.

269
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:09,340
That's why you're gonna
work with him.

270
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:12,438
All you have to do is to make sure...

271
00:29:12,647 --> 00:29:14,911
...he does not unnecessarily
compromise our agenda.

272
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,980
Now, you seriously think
I can help you in this?

273
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:23,453
If you work with me on this one,
I'll make it worth your while.

274
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:26,991
Look, I know that
you and Marshall are close.

275
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:29,686
But he can't give you
the career you want.

276
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:34,834
Not the opportunities a young, gifted,
vibrant biochemist really deserves.

277
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:38,566
- So this is what it's like, huh?
- What's that?

278
00:29:39,073 --> 00:29:40,973
Making a deal
with the devil himself.

279
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:48,115
- Have you had contact with him?
- Aroon?

280
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:50,147
No. I worked with him.

281
00:29:51,185 --> 00:29:52,914
I taught him everything he knows.

282
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:55,887
Except how to resist temptation.

283
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:04,955
I decided to introduce CTX
to the club scene.

284
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,361
New party drug.

285
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:09,934
Has an exquisite high.
Very pleasurable.

286
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:12,367
Instantly addictive, but very...

287
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:15,474
- Lucrative?
- Yes.

288
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,211
But when one doesn't have CTX
for a while...

289
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:21,438
...one becomes a bit
of a lethargic mess.

290
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:26,416
Traces of CTX lodge themselves
in your system and become dormant.

291
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,851
They gradually change your DNA.

292
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:33,015
And under the right circumstances,
they can be triggered.

293
00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:38,358
Especially in situations involving
conflict or aggression.

294
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,028
And that's what I think
happened to your boys.

295
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:45,732
They probably got a bit
carried away with Reina.

296
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:51,274
She mistook their libido
for aggression and, well...

297
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:53,709
Spare me the psychology.

298
00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:59,679
When your body is suddenly
flooded with adrenalin from the CTX...

299
00:30:59,887 --> 00:31:03,220
...you become a bit like a wild animal,
fighting for survival.

300
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,551
You become a killing machine.

301
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,791
You have no morals.
You have no humanity.

302
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:15,759
And that's what the government was,
and is, interested in.

303
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:20,336
A drug that makes soldiers
mindless killers...

304
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,634
...right up until
the point that they die.

305
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:24,936
- And Tia knows this?
- Of course.

306
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:28,946
CTX was our baby.
We developed it together.

307
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:33,284
Robinson and Werner kept
the whole operation very hush-hush.

308
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:37,514
It was to be their big step up
through the ranks.

309
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:40,357
We want to talk to your boss.

310
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:45,161
I don't think she'll be interested
in that conversation.

311
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,927
We'll see about that.

312
00:31:49,904 --> 00:31:51,929
Where is she hiding?

313
00:32:07,154 --> 00:32:08,917
Where is she?

314
00:32:09,123 --> 00:32:11,455
I'm doing you a favor.

315
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:15,390
If you were all to arrive there,
she'd kill you instantly.

316
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:18,531
You think the U.S. Army is just
gonna walk away from this?

317
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:21,497
Even if they did, I would
hunt you down and kill you myself.

318
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:23,033
Well, it's already too late.

319
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:26,832
A large quantity of CTX is going to be
released into the city's water supply.

320
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,772
Everyone within a 100-mile radius is
either going to be addicted or dead.

321
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:33,310
You got it all wrong, Aroon.

322
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:44,518
Oh, you're going to regret that,
soldier boy.

323
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,320
I don't think so, guinea pig.

324
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,631
Revenge is a two-way street.

325
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,434
Watch him.
I'm going to get a medic.

326
00:33:16,257 --> 00:33:17,281
Need a light?

327
00:33:36,277 --> 00:33:38,336
- We're being followed.
- Who are they?

328
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:41,538
I don't know. I'm about to find out.

329
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:45,282
I think they might be
Robinson's boys.

330
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:50,946
Can I help you?

331
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:54,619
- Why's that?
- Well, because you're following us.

332
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:55,853
I'm not following you.

333
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:59,328
You know what, man?
I bet you if I reach in your pocket...

334
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:00,966
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What is this?

335
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:04,001
Well, see now, Naval Intelligence.

336
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:06,537
I'm disappointed. You lied to me.

337
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:36,160
Tell me something.

338
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:39,797
Should we be cooperating
with Robinson and Majestic?

339
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,627
None of that stuff works.

340
00:35:42,136 --> 00:35:44,366
So you're telling me
Tia is our only option?

341
00:35:44,572 --> 00:35:48,338
That's right, baby. That's right.

342
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:55,113
Tell me what you know.

343
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:59,150
It's Majestic.

344
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:02,913
They're putting together
another strike team.

345
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:07,557
We've got to try
and persuade Tia to join us.

346
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:16,734
Sir, this will turn ugly.

347
00:36:17,237 --> 00:36:19,535
I think the ship already
sailed on that.

348
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,332
It's still containable.

349
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:24,978
We need to contact our people,
bring them in for their own protection.

350
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:28,012
Now, you know the liaison.
Now, you worked with her.

351
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:30,746
She wouldn't endanger the program,
right?

352
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,786
You trained them.

353
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:37,754
They've worked together before.
They're close.

354
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,256
I can't guarantee you anything.

355
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,072
Just a friendly visit.

356
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:00,838
- Your idea, or hers?
- Does it matter?

357
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:02,515
She might cut out your allowance.

358
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:05,184
Just like Robinson and Werner
cut out yours?

359
00:37:05,386 --> 00:37:07,513
- Only for a little while.
- I'm sure.

360
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:11,782
First, they need you in the trenches,
with Marshall and his grunts.

361
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:13,755
I wouldn't be there
if it wasn't for you.

362
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:15,292
Oh, come on.

363
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:23,160
The right deal will come along
and you'll be a defector someday.

364
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,928
Not as a fugitive from the law.

365
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:29,838
Now, I may not have my own dentistry
or retirement plan, exactly...

366
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:33,377
...but I am doing what we love to do,
Tia.

367
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,844
Well, enjoy it.
Because it ain't gonna last.

368
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,847
Oh, yes. Of course.

369
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:41,613
I forgot. Marshall.

370
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:48,459
You remember the excitement when
we first sequenced the CTX formula?

371
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:54,431
You and I,
we complement each other, Tia.

372
00:37:55,302 --> 00:37:57,634
Work for me.

373
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:03,068
Work with me.

374
00:38:05,713 --> 00:38:11,117
So do I take it that's a no?

375
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:12,307
Yes.

376
00:38:14,188 --> 00:38:17,123
Of course, you realize
there will be consequences.

377
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,940
- Were you followed?
- We were followed.

378
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,034
- But we took care of that.
- Good.

379
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:41,675
If words gets back to Werner
that I'm talking to you guys...

380
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:44,008
I don't think you'll have to
worry about Werner.

381
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:47,016
He might not be happy
about our personal thing...

382
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:50,384
...but he knows who sent me here
and he knows why I'm here...

383
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,458
...so he's not gonna say
nothing to me.

384
00:38:55,062 --> 00:38:57,053
My entire fucking team's
wiped out...

385
00:38:57,264 --> 00:39:00,665
...so you know what would be
really helpful right now?

386
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:02,631
If you stop feeding us this bullshit...

387
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:04,736
...and give us decent intel
that we can use.

388
00:39:04,938 --> 00:39:08,533
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you think I'm here?

389
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,441
I'm very sorry about your team.

390
00:39:11,678 --> 00:39:13,407
I'm sorry for your men.

391
00:39:14,882 --> 00:39:17,214
But you know what I think
would be very nice?

392
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:20,044
If you'd realize that I'm on your side.

393
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:22,750
You know Aroon's escaped.

394
00:39:22,956 --> 00:39:24,890
He knows you're onto him.

395
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:27,492
And I know he's gonna
follow through with his plans.

396
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:35,424
If that's the case, I'll brief your team
on what kind of weapons will work...

397
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:36,694
...and what won't.

398
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:39,737
- What will you do about Werner?
- Forget it.

399
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,033
I'll go to the admiral myself.

400
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:46,042
Believe me when I tell you, he will
give us carte blanche for this mission.

401
00:40:03,297 --> 00:40:06,494
They're Lambert's cops.
Let's have some fun.

402
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,664
Hey, guys, they are onto us.

403
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:45,337
Let's call for backup.

404
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:20,334
It is unfortunate you could not have
persuaded Tia to join us.

405
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:23,602
She would have been a great asset.

406
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,779
Yes. I'm sorry to have failed
in that regard.

407
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,004
Don't be ridiculous.

408
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:30,410
Nothing can stop us
from reaching our goal.

409
00:41:30,617 --> 00:41:32,710
Tia and Marshall will be
relentless now.

410
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,888
They'll do all that they can
to hunt us down.

411
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:36,919
First, they have to find us.

412
00:41:37,124 --> 00:41:40,525
Be assured, Marshall will use
all of his resources to do that.

413
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:42,422
It will be too late. Right?

414
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:46,926
- You want me to go ahead with it?
- I'm surprised you haven't already.

415
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:48,829
It was your idea, after all.

416
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:53,304
- It's fairly radical.
- Brilliant.

417
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:56,303
We are forced to react now.

418
00:41:57,044 --> 00:41:58,909
Consider it done.

419
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:01,808
CTX will enter the city's water supply
within an hour.

420
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:03,949
It'll spread very rapidly.

421
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:09,014
Most of the population will be addicted
come, say, dinnertime.

422
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:24,669
Where is the other body?

423
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:44,088
Detective Lambert, phone.

424
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:50,094
The undercover agents are dead.

425
00:42:52,632 --> 00:42:55,601
- All three of them?
- Yes, sir.

426
00:43:49,823 --> 00:43:51,814
You wanted to see me?

427
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:54,994
We've had traces of CTX show up
in the town's water supply.

428
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:57,220
Do we know where?

429
00:43:58,665 --> 00:44:03,102
My intel is tracing the readings
back to the source of the CTX.

430
00:44:03,937 --> 00:44:08,340
Good, that is worth knowing.
How much time we got?

431
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:12,069
Current measurements predict
15,000 people...

432
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:16,272
...will be fully addicted to CTX
in the next 12 hours.

433
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:18,849
I'm afraid Werner and Robinson
will let this happen...

434
00:44:19,052 --> 00:44:20,952
...and make us the scapegoats.

435
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:28,728
Marshall's not gonna let that happen.
He's got a new team together.

436
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:31,830
Tell Marshall I'm having
his armory brought here.

437
00:44:40,674 --> 00:44:42,437
Thanks for the decent intel.

438
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:44,769
You're welcome, soldier.

439
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:03,461
What are we doing here?

440
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:05,062
It's my place.

441
00:45:05,265 --> 00:45:08,029
I have two agents here to brief us.

442
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:25,282
- Admiral, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

443
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:28,914
- Do I need to be worried?
- Not in the least.

444
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:31,590
- Everything's under control.
- Everything?

445
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:36,087
Are you keeping me
informed of everything?

446
00:45:36,296 --> 00:45:38,764
Admiral, I can handle it.

447
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:40,455
Handle it?

448
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:51,441
At the end of the day, none of this
will ever have happened. Okay?

449
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:04,955
I never liked the CTX program,
or Werner and Robinson.

450
00:46:05,158 --> 00:46:08,286
- Who handles the case locally?
- Detective Lambert, I believe.

451
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:09,462
I want to talk to him.

452
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,530
We're gonna have to start
kicking over some trash cans.

453
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,794
Our low-orbiting recon has determined
the parameters of their activities.

454
00:46:18,004 --> 00:46:20,268
It includes the outskirts of the city,
as well as...

455
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:38,856
Marshall, don't shoot.
We need her alive.

456
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:23,998
Nice timing, Dwayne.

457
00:47:24,204 --> 00:47:27,537
Dwayne, get me the injured
out of here, ASAP.

458
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:30,073
Get me a cleanup team in here,
ASAP.

459
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,708
Got the Wicked Witch of the North
here. Try to secure her.

460
00:47:34,381 --> 00:47:38,044
Get her into the Majestic lab
and in interrogation, ASAP.

461
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:42,020
Dwayne, give me a hand,
would you?

462
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:53,293
So, what's the intel?

463
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,231
We have confirmed reports
of primary victims...

464
00:47:57,437 --> 00:47:59,234
...those most vulnerable
to the infection.

465
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:02,465
Sadly, more of these will just pinpoint
Aroon's base and the CTX lab.

466
00:48:02,676 --> 00:48:05,201
- How are we gonna deal with them?
- The way we always do.

467
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:07,505
Let's go to the armory.

468
00:48:22,996 --> 00:48:25,590
Marshall, I have these just for you.

469
00:48:26,066 --> 00:48:27,590
These Nanographite blades...

470
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:30,736
...were built for a man
with your kind of fighting skills.

471
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:33,738
They are of
the strongest substance known...

472
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,843
...and will extend to fight as fast as
the reflexes of the person using them.

473
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:40,740
Now, they're assimilated
to your body.

474
00:48:40,947 --> 00:48:44,849
They should balance the reflexes
of someone addicted to CTX.

475
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:47,648
They'll come in handy.

476
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:57,027
I think this is a lot bigger than any
one of us could have ever imagined.

477
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,095
I still got a few tricks up my sleeve.

478
00:48:59,299 --> 00:49:01,767
I'm glad somebody does.

479
00:49:10,977 --> 00:49:13,138
I'm gonna check it out.

480
00:49:20,086 --> 00:49:21,951
What the fuck were they thinking?

481
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:24,419
It's just really a shame
it turned out this way.

482
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:27,525
- What's the story with Tia?
- Tia's good.

483
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:30,793
That's my girl. I trained her.

484
00:49:30,997 --> 00:49:32,521
She has a lot of special abilities.

485
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:34,393
She has a lot of special technique.

486
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:37,166
She'll work out good for us.

487
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:40,399
We're fucked, aren't we?

488
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,467
I don't think so.

489
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:44,506
You think we have a chance?

490
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,605
I do.

491
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:54,783
Are you losing control
of the situation?

492
00:49:54,988 --> 00:49:57,718
They're in a secure area.

493
00:49:57,924 --> 00:50:00,518
Nothing should endanger
the program.

494
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:04,329
We are all in danger
until they are dead.

495
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:10,231
Unless we can bring them to us,
on our terms.

496
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,251
You got a plan?

497
00:50:34,894 --> 00:50:37,522
Well, see, we're kind of between
a rock and a hard place.

498
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,960
We had to come in here
to get stuff we needed...

499
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:42,600
...but as soon as we accessed
the building, Werner knew.

500
00:50:43,703 --> 00:50:45,227
So we got trouble.

501
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:48,200
I'm starting to think
we should call for backup.

502
00:50:48,408 --> 00:50:50,774
Unfortunately, it's not going to be
backup that comes.

503
00:50:50,977 --> 00:50:53,912
It's going to be a strike team
to take us out.

504
00:50:54,113 --> 00:50:55,102
Oh, shit.

505
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:57,109
Okay, guys.
Get your teams up and out.

506
00:50:57,317 --> 00:50:58,978
I've got something to do here.

507
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:00,186
Let's go.

508
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:06,519
So, what have we got?

509
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:10,594
The old transit holding center
has gone online, sir.

510
00:51:11,564 --> 00:51:14,032
Which means
they've occupied the building.

511
00:51:17,136 --> 00:51:19,195
Send in a strike team. Soft entry.

512
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:25,000
- Morgan's onto us.
- But he's not the problem.

513
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:27,736
We're talking mass hysteria
if this gets out.

514
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:30,211
Let's make goddamned sure
it doesn't.

515
00:51:37,357 --> 00:51:40,019
Well, Reina.
Here are your choices: talk or die.

516
00:51:40,226 --> 00:51:43,593
I hope you do the right thing because
enough people have died already.

517
00:51:46,032 --> 00:51:47,522
Where is Aroon's base?

518
00:51:53,406 --> 00:51:56,239
Reina, do you hear me?
I'm running out of patience.

519
00:51:56,676 --> 00:51:58,644
I will never tell you anything.

520
00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:01,245
This time you really pissed me off.

521
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:05,981
You killed all of my best men.
That wasn't nice.

522
00:52:07,987 --> 00:52:09,750
Now, you know
what this will do to you.

523
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,716
Now, I'm going to give you
about three seconds.

524
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:17,226
In three seconds,
if you don't tell me...

525
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,228
...I will kill you.
Just like you did to my men.

526
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:21,923
One.

527
00:52:22,135 --> 00:52:23,966
Two.

528
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,664
Three.

529
00:52:26,139 --> 00:52:27,766
Bastia!

530
00:52:33,146 --> 00:52:34,909
Not so tough after all.

531
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:37,514
- She did the right thing.
- He's a very good listener.

532
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:12,051
Clear.

533
00:53:12,585 --> 00:53:14,712
- Clear.
- Clear.

534
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:16,218
Clear.

535
00:53:16,422 --> 00:53:18,219
- Clear.
- Sir?

536
00:53:32,538 --> 00:53:35,336
They're gone. Let's get out of here.

537
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:40,268
Damn it!

538
00:53:41,547 --> 00:53:44,345
The lab has been
completely wiped, sir.

539
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,950
We have a shitload
of weapons missing...

540
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:49,246
...and technology unaccounted for.

541
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:51,082
Who code-accessed the building?

542
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,155
The liaison, Tia.

543
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:55,124
And Marshall Lawson.

544
00:53:55,328 --> 00:53:56,795
- You know him, right?
- Oh, yeah.

545
00:53:56,996 --> 00:53:59,897
He's a headcase. Does what he wants.
We had to transfer him out.

546
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:01,430
Where are they now?

547
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:04,467
We are using a tracking device
as we speak.

548
00:54:05,171 --> 00:54:06,661
Wait right there, sir.

549
00:54:06,873 --> 00:54:08,602
This area is restricted.
Can I help you?

550
00:54:08,808 --> 00:54:11,834
Detective Lambert. Local police.

551
00:54:12,045 --> 00:54:13,307
And?

552
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,912
These are undercover policemen.

553
00:54:17,116 --> 00:54:18,310
My guys.

554
00:54:20,053 --> 00:54:23,147
The autopsy showed up
a big amount of a substance...

555
00:54:23,356 --> 00:54:26,257
...and the rumor is that
it was developed by the military.

556
00:54:26,759 --> 00:54:28,784
And you have evidence
to support this?

557
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:31,555
Is three dead bodies not enough?

558
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:34,961
No. I don't think I can help you.

559
00:54:35,168 --> 00:54:36,760
You're wasting my time.

560
00:54:37,437 --> 00:54:40,964
This is not military business.
Take it up with my superiors.

561
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:44,237
You bet I will.

562
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,073
Are you sure this is secure?

563
00:55:17,343 --> 00:55:19,436
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I set it up.

564
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,515
- You don't think we should call it in?
- Let's get there first.

565
00:55:23,716 --> 00:55:25,946
Well, we will call in
when the time is right.

566
00:55:26,552 --> 00:55:28,179
So, what are we going to do?

567
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:30,617
We're going to send in
our best A-team.

568
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:33,815
I've gone to a lot of trouble
to teach my number one finest...

569
00:55:34,026 --> 00:55:35,459
...who's infected with CTX...

570
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:36,855
...and who's not.

571
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:38,052
You know that.

572
00:55:38,264 --> 00:55:39,822
Once they know we've made them...

573
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:42,432
...they will be killing us real quick.

574
00:55:42,635 --> 00:55:45,069
It's either them or us.

575
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:47,205
First come, first served.

576
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:51,902
It's off the A88. Just east.

577
00:55:56,382 --> 00:55:58,179
Can I talk to you?

578
00:55:59,418 --> 00:56:01,215
Yeah. Talk away.

579
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,387
In private?

580
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:06,818
Sure.

581
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:17,859
Clean the slate.
Find the bitch and take her out.

582
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:20,766
Robinson, yeah. Go ahead.

583
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,508
We got them.

584
00:56:24,143 --> 00:56:25,610
Safe house on the edge of town.

585
00:56:25,812 --> 00:56:28,042
Make sure you get it right this time.

586
00:56:43,462 --> 00:56:45,123
I pray we're making
the right decision.

587
00:56:45,331 --> 00:56:46,992
Can I trust you?

588
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:49,968
I certainly hope so.

589
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:53,027
You know I care for you.

590
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:54,467
I know.

591
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:56,602
Me too.

592
00:57:09,956 --> 00:57:12,186
Identification, please.

593
00:57:18,097 --> 00:57:20,031
Hey. I'll cover the back on my own.

594
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:21,791
Your team, cover the front.

595
00:59:57,556 --> 00:59:58,853
- Clear.
- Clear.

596
01:00:27,553 --> 01:00:28,747
You sent in a team...

597
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:31,479
...without my authorization?

598
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:34,989
I had to make a split decision.
I think it was the right one.

599
01:00:35,194 --> 01:00:38,027
You seriously underestimated
Marshall and his abilities.

600
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:40,494
We've got a secure call
coming in for you, admiral.

601
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,262
Who is it?

602
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:45,767
Won't say. But he's on
one of our secure walkies.

603
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,138
- Patch him into the speakerphone.
- Done.

604
01:00:50,743 --> 01:00:52,335
You're on with him now.

605
01:00:52,545 --> 01:00:55,105
- <i>Admiral?</i>
- What can I do for you, Marshall?

606
01:00:56,549 --> 01:01:00,041
I'm flattered, really flattered,
you recognize my voice.

607
01:01:00,252 --> 01:01:02,914
You're the only one
to pull a stunt like this.

608
01:01:03,255 --> 01:01:05,723
I'm assuming the strike team
is dead.

609
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:07,852
Yeah, that's a good assumption.

610
01:01:08,461 --> 01:01:11,430
<i>Tell Werner he needs to get up</i>
<i>earlier than that.</i>

611
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,063
Aroon's base has been located...

612
01:01:13,265 --> 01:01:16,564
...in a small village somewhere
outside of Bordeaux called...

613
01:01:16,769 --> 01:01:18,031
Bastia.

614
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:19,404
Bastia.

615
01:01:21,607 --> 01:01:23,302
I can handle this.

616
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,944
Marshall...

617
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,547
...tell me when and where.

618
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:42,258
All right. I'll send you an encryption
with the gory details...

619
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:45,953
...but suffice it to say
that I'd like my favorite A-team...

620
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:49,225
...to shoot in here right quick.

621
01:01:49,435 --> 01:01:51,995
And we're going to do this
the old-fashioned way.

622
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:55,199
<i>It looks like we'll be</i>
<i>working together after all.</i>

623
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:58,968
<i>I'll provide the intel and the training,</i>
<i>you give me the men.</i>

624
01:02:01,447 --> 01:02:04,007
Order B-company to mobilize.

625
01:02:08,988 --> 01:02:10,717
Let's move out.

626
01:03:10,649 --> 01:03:12,412
If we maintain
the element of surprise...

627
01:03:12,618 --> 01:03:14,882
...while the sections enter
and search the village...

628
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:17,920
...then I will lead the attack force...

629
01:03:18,123 --> 01:03:19,920
...and push forward
towards Aroon's base.

630
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:23,384
Any specifics that the Army
should know about?

631
01:03:23,596 --> 01:03:25,530
Watch for the rapid pulsation
in the eyes.

632
01:03:25,731 --> 01:03:27,722
If you see that, you have no time.

633
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:31,527
Because of the CTX,
they are pumped full of adrenaline...

634
01:03:31,737 --> 01:03:35,639
...giving them almost superhuman
strength and reflexes.

635
01:03:36,742 --> 01:03:40,803
I say, again, they are animals
out to kill you and your men.

636
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,045
What about containment, Marshall?

637
01:03:43,249 --> 01:03:45,080
We believe
that the perimeter's secure...

638
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:47,514
...and we will be able
to stop any breaches.

639
01:03:48,087 --> 01:03:49,884
Oh, I'm pleased to hear that,
Marshall.

640
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:52,447
But if this fucks up,
if the world goes down...

641
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:54,683
...you're going to have to
go down with it.

642
01:03:54,994 --> 01:03:57,758
Well, in that case,
maybe we could take Werner with us.

643
01:03:57,963 --> 01:04:00,796
He can report back to you
everything we're doing. How's that?

644
01:04:01,367 --> 01:04:02,766
Good idea.

645
01:04:04,103 --> 01:04:05,661
Well, I'm...

646
01:04:05,871 --> 01:04:07,634
I'm not dressed.

647
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,207
That's okay. We'll put camos on you
and give you a machine gun...

648
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:12,604
...and let you come with us.

649
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:55,248
<i>Detective Lambert</i>
<i>for Admiral Morgan.</i>

650
01:04:55,454 --> 01:04:57,149
Sir, you've got a call for you.

651
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:03,958
<i>You said to call you</i>
<i>with information.</i>

652
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:07,730
I am here at the cathedral.

653
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:09,764
This is where
you need to send your troops.

654
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:11,902
You know it's out of my jurisdiction.

655
01:05:12,104 --> 01:05:13,332
<i>It's okay, we're on it.</i>

656
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:15,302
Okay, <i>salut.</i>

657
01:05:18,844 --> 01:05:22,075
Troops are on the outskirts
of Bastia, admiral.

658
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,645
<i>Section one in position.</i>

659
01:06:54,273 --> 01:06:56,434
<i>Section two in position.</i>

660
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:14,982
<i>Section three in position.</i>

661
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:26,638
Marshall?

662
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:30,338
This is Marshall. Go ahead, admiral.

663
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:34,444
Our intel tracking tells us they have
gone to ground in an old church.

664
01:07:34,646 --> 01:07:36,170
I have those coordinates, sir.

665
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:38,140
And, Marshall...

666
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:40,612
...my troops are still deployed
in the village.

667
01:07:40,819 --> 01:07:43,185
I can't send you any backup.

668
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:48,085
From here, you and your guys
are on your own. Good luck.

669
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,523
<i>Copy that, sir.</i>

670
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:24,320
<i>Let's check out the guardhouse.</i>

671
01:08:47,986 --> 01:08:49,886
Okay, don't move.

672
01:08:51,623 --> 01:08:53,352
Just a few questions for you.

673
01:08:54,893 --> 01:08:56,656
Leave us alone.

674
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:30,193
Who is at the cathedral?

675
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:33,187
I don't know.

676
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:36,230
Watch their eyes for CTX symptoms.

677
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:46,076
Quiet, don't move.

678
01:10:03,195 --> 01:10:05,527
Check the eyes
for changes in dilation.

679
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:19,572
- Tell me or I'll kill you.
- Go fuck yourself.

680
01:10:21,213 --> 01:10:23,408
They're on CTX. I can see it.

681
01:10:38,096 --> 01:10:39,688
Don't move.

682
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:46,830
Let's head to the cathedral.

683
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,959
The eyes, check the eyes.

684
01:11:15,867 --> 01:11:17,732
Check their eyes.

685
01:11:18,036 --> 01:11:19,230
Clear.

686
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,385
Get up.

687
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:35,171
This one's okay.

688
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,505
Let's go, men.

689
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:47,651
He's okay. Let's go.

690
01:13:53,859 --> 01:13:55,451
Let's go.

691
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:27,010
- What is it?
- Nothing.

692
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:29,043
Gotta be something
to make you hang back.

693
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:31,477
Right, let's just keep up
with Marshall.

694
01:16:31,983 --> 01:16:33,883
He'll be fine.

695
01:16:34,185 --> 01:16:36,847
We need to rely on our instincts
to get out of here alive.

696
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:39,853
- So, what is it, soldier?
- Aroon's lab.

697
01:16:40,859 --> 01:16:42,349
Gotta be somewhere around here.

698
01:16:45,263 --> 01:16:48,323
- Let's take a look.
- Okay.

699
01:17:04,682 --> 01:17:06,479
- CTX?
- Yeah.

700
01:17:06,684 --> 01:17:08,174
It's still unrefined.

701
01:17:08,386 --> 01:17:11,116
It needs to dry out
to get its powder form.

702
01:17:11,322 --> 01:17:13,517
How much is all this worth?

703
01:17:13,725 --> 01:17:15,818
Enough to get scared.

704
01:17:16,895 --> 01:17:18,829
Real scared.

705
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,901
Shit. He fucking did it.

706
01:17:26,171 --> 01:17:28,537
It's the city's water supply system.

707
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:31,800
- And?
- He's contaminated it.

708
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:34,171
Effective enough
for a hundred-mile radius.

709
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:38,909
Bastard!

710
01:17:58,269 --> 01:18:00,328
We're splitting into fours.
A-team goes left...

711
01:18:00,538 --> 01:18:02,233
...B- team goes to the right, let's go.

712
01:18:50,054 --> 01:18:52,784
I told you there'd be consequences.

713
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:08,504
Dwayne, lead the B-team.

714
01:19:10,341 --> 01:19:12,502
Yes, sir. Let's go.

715
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:19,416
Nobu, let's move.

716
01:20:05,163 --> 01:20:06,824
Sir?

717
01:21:35,753 --> 01:21:37,516
Fuck.

718
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:40,357
Let's go.

719
01:23:37,642 --> 01:23:39,166
I lost everybody, sir.

720
01:23:39,377 --> 01:23:41,368
They're all dead.

721
01:25:47,538 --> 01:25:49,199
So...

722
01:25:49,607 --> 01:25:51,666
...now you've come
to kill me, Marshall.

723
01:25:52,677 --> 01:25:56,579
But as you know,
revenge is a two-way street.

724
01:25:57,748 --> 01:26:01,206
Maybe you'd consider
joining forces?

725
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,848
I see, of course not.

726
01:26:07,058 --> 01:26:10,221
You're a military man,
a man of honor and integrity.

727
01:26:11,729 --> 01:26:14,129
That's too bad.

728
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,426
In that case, you will all die.
I promise you.

729
01:26:20,972 --> 01:26:23,770
Nobu and I will take this bitch.
Dwayne, watch the back door.
