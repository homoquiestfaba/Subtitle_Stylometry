1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,260
10 years ago...

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,760
Sarah, the bus just pulled up,
you have got about 3 seconds!

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,680
I'm right here.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,613
Here you go, Peanut.

5
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:30,100
Weak bread, no mustard
and there is a big surprise for dessert.

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,260
- You mean, an apple?
- Surprised?

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,990
I've packed your warm pajamas
and your flashlight

8
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,190
and don't talk back to Stephany's mother,
even if Stephany does it.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,690
I won't...

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,680
Have fun!

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,710
- You know, how much mommy loves you!
- And I love mommy back!

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,900
Now, go, hug your dad!

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,020
Good morning, Rachel!

14
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,700
<i>"You are invited to a dinner with Jesus Christ..."</i>

15
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,010
- Yes?
- Rachel, could you come in here, please?

16
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,670
Be right there...

17
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,530
Yes?

18
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,930
Do you know,
how this got on my keyboard?

19
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,180
I didn't see anybody coming in here...
What is it?

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,510
Apparently, some kind of joke.

21
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,140
No, All it says is:

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,940
<i>"You are invited to a dinner
with Jesus Christ, Pepino's, 7 o'clock."</i>

23
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,670
Here we are!

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,790
Nikki! Hi!

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,460
I'm Jesus.

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,500
Aha......

27
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,070
Excuse me, am I supposed to know you?

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,740
Good question.

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,790
Yes, the answer is: yes.

30
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,670
I'm sorry, as far as I can remember,
I have never met you.

31
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,950
That is true!

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,980
Ok, let's just start over.

33
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,280
- Your name is...
- Jesus.

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,520
My family called me Yeshua.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,740
Your family...

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,720
- From?
- Nazareth.

37
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,790
I don't thing, there is much I can actually
say to convince you that I am Jesus.

38
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,050
Oh, there is one true statement...

39
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,400
I thought, they went through your hands.

40
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,100
No.

41
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,050
The spikes were driven through my wrist.

42
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,230
So where do we go from here?

43
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,300
Good question.

44
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,510
Where do you wanna go?

45
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm glad, you showed up, Nikki.

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,590
I've enjoyed our time together.

47
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,230
I have, too...

48
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,310
You know, when I tell people, that I had dinner
with Jesus, they are gonna think, I'm crazy.

49
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,550
Then maybe, you shouldn't tell them...

50
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,200
This morning...

51
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,270
Sarah, it's almost time to go!

52
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,210
ANOTHER PERFECT STRANGER

53
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,430
- Sarah...
- I'll be right down.

54
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,571
- You gonna miss your plane...
- I'm on the phone!

55
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,920
Hi, could you ring Mr. Newman
in admissions, please?

56
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,810
Thanks.

57
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,980
Hi Mr. Newman, this is Sarah Cominskey.

58
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,480
I just wanted to ask...

59
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,600
What? Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world!

60
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,090
I'm supposed to land in Portland this evening.

61
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,460
I'm really looking for see you in the campus.

62
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,360
Has there anybody worked yet on my application?

63
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,810
Oh! What about my portfolio? Was it...?

64
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm sorry, I know. You get hundreds...

65
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,250
Well, I guess,
I'll see you sometime tomorrow then.

66
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,789
Thanks so much, bye.

67
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,220
No... That's ok. I'm already running late...
I can find everything.

68
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
Yes.

69
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,790
Yes, I remembered.

70
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,940
No, but dad gave my 50 dollars
this morning, and I've got my ATM card...

71
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,800
Mom, I will...

72
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,930
I said, I will!

73
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,801
Ok, look, I'm next in the line to the ticket counter,
I gotta go, I will call you, when I land.

74
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,230
Yeah. You, too.

75
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,244
Next...

76
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,120
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I need to check in.

77
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,310
- Your last name?
- Cominskey.

78
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,220
- First name?
- Sarah.

79
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,480
- And where are you travelling today?
- Portland.

80
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,960
Chicago people are supposed to fly west
in the winter not in the spring...

81
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,610
Alright, we have you flying into Dallas
and then on to Portland.

82
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,270
- Just one bag today?
- Just one.

83
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,900
I just need to see your ID
and have you on your way.

84
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,590
Seat B17, enjoy your flight!

85
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,030
Next...

86
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,430
Great...

87
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,420
Stuck between two guys...

88
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,340
Excuse me.

89
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,280
Not a thing to read...

90
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,100
Yes.

91
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,170
What did I do?!

92
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,530
What? Oh, Steph. I'm sorry, I thought...

93
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,430
Never mind.

94
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,150
- What's up?
- Are you still on the airport?

95
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,630
No, I'm on the plane.
We are getting ready to pull away from the gate.

96
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,200
Are you excited?

97
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,590
Steph, I have never been so glad
to get away from mom and dad in my life.

98
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,960
Because of the fight you guys had last night?

99
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,010
They just didn't let me a breathe
with this religious stuff...

100
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,820
I barely said two words them this morning.

101
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,630
Is this on sale?

102
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,020
Does it say, "it's on sale" ?!

103
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,350
Well, I couldn't believe,
when you called last night.

104
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,050
I mean, you are always going to church,
what else do they want?

105
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,650
To control all my thoughts?

106
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,910
But it got worse, after I talked to you.

107
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,340
What happened?

108
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,370
Later on, mom totally freaked me out
with this Jesus thing and...

109
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,300
I had better to get off...
I call you later. Bye.

110
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,280
Have you considered the possibility
that your parents may be right?

111
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,410
Hm?

112
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,920
I couldn't help to overhear your conversation.

113
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,640
Has it occur to you
that your parents might be right?

114
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,280
Right about what?

115
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,920
About God.

116
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,180
What do you mean?

117
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,830
Well, it sounds like your mother and
your dad have found Jesus.

118
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:05,000
The only thing my parents have found is
an excuse to control my life as they want!

119
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,050
Listen, I'm really not in a talking mood, ok?

120
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,560
I noticed, that you were looking something to read.
Do you want one part of my paper?

121
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,240
No, thanks. I want to finish my "Sky Shopper"

122
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,550
Do you mind, if I ask you another question?

123
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,790
No, go ahead!

124
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,270
Have you thought about
a personal relationship with God?

125
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,820
No, I'm not into religion.

126
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm not talking about religion,
I'm talking about a relationship.

127
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,810
You are talking about God. That's religion.

128
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,540
What I'm talking about is, knowing Him personally.

129
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,350
Whatever...

130
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,540
Do you even believe in God?

131
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,400
No, I don't think, I do.

132
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,260
You don't think He exists at all?

133
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,750
- Who knows! Listen...
- Let's just say, He does!

134
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,130
So what we are talking about is reality,
not religion. Right?

135
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,640
Like I said, anything that has to do with God,
is religion.

136
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,420
And I don't want any part of it...

137
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,590
Ok. Let me ask you this:

138
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,650
if you die tonight,
do you know where would you go?

139
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,210
No! I don't! God!

140
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,840
I just hate to see you throw your
life away at such a young age.

141
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,670
Look, Sir! I don't mean to be rude,

142
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,940
but you don't know anything about me or my life,

143
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,580
and yet, you still try to cram your beliefs
down my throat, just like my parents!

144
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,320
Excuse me!

145
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,680
Hey...

146
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,980
I'm sorry, I made you mad. It's just
that I have a niece in your age and...

147
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,010
It's alright. Just drop it!

148
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,660
- Yeah. Enjoy the rest of your flight.
- I'll try.

149
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,000
How is that?

150
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,240
That looks like MY pony!

151
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,460
Really? What is your pony's name?

152
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,280
- Titan.
- Titan?

153
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,070
- What's wrong?
- He needs a saddle!

154
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,040
- Can you draw one on?
- Yeah!

155
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,560
How is this?

156
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,610
That's perfect!

157
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,410
Titan is ready for a ride now.

158
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,050
All you need is your name on it.

159
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,480
Mommy, look!

160
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,870
- Thank you.
- You are very welcome, Courtney.

161
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,000
- Bye!
- Bye now!

162
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,970
- Here you go.
- Thanks. I almost forget, I ordered this.

163
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,150
Where are you heading?

164
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,360
Portland.

165
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,720
Do you have your family there?

166
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,040
No. I applied the Art Institute out there,
and I'm gonna to check it out.

167
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,570
Oh... Have you been accepted?

168
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,850
I don't know yet.

169
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,260
But you are still flying out to see it.

170
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,360
Well, the dean said, it was alright.

171
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,370
And that worth spending on my babysitting money

172
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,530
and a chance to get away
from home for a few days.

173
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,700
Babysitting...
That's a fun job.

174
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,160
Sometimes.

175
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,780
I see, you are good with kids.

176
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,120
Sure, I love them.

177
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,390
Do you have any?

178
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,000
No. No physical descendants.

179
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,270
- Physical descendants?!
- That's right.

180
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,990
- You see more relaxed.
- Why wouldn't I be?

181
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,920
Just saw that little toss
with your friend over there...

182
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,170
Oh, I was probably a little bit testy.

183
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,180
Ah... It's understandable.

184
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,940
You heard?

185
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,120
It was hard not to.

186
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,690
Sorry.

187
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,270
Trouble with the folks, hah?

188
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,160
Big trouble...
And I have no idea how I gonna handle it.

189
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,500
Why is that?

190
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,540
Because I always got along so well
with my mom and dad,

191
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,490
and then, right as I'm ready to choose a college,
they have to ruin everything with this

192
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,140
forced religion stuff.

193
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,340
And they never mentioned it to you before?

194
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,830
Well, yeah. We started going
to church when I was like 10,

195
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,150
but it was always fun, you know,
things like Sunday school and church camp.

196
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,548
Even in high school it was just a social thing,
because all my friends were there..

197
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:28,180
But you never bothered into it, right?

198
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,110
I guess. I never took it that so seriously.

199
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,820
Like praying before meals:
it was just a rutine.

200
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,730
And I thought, mom and dad
thought the same way.

201
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,710
So that brought things to a head...

202
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,200
Last night we were sitting
around the dinner table,

203
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,000
and somehow the conversation turned to
people's beliefs, and god, and bla bla...

204
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,220
And I told mom and dad,
that I didn't really think, that god existed.

205
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,960
Why did you say that?

206
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,400
I don't know. It just came out.

207
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,010
I mean, I see a lot of other religions out there,
all the movie-stars in the Scientology...

208
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,340
Yeah... It's really big right now.

209
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,150
Yeah. I mean... the Bible stories were alright,
when I was a little kid,

210
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,090
but the older I get, and the more I read,

211
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:19,460
the idea of a big guy watching us from the
clouds somewhere just doesn't seem real.

212
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,750
Let me guess, this hasn't gone
too well with mom and dad.

213
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,860
Hmm. You should have seen
the looks on their faces.

214
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,150
Then they got into this whole big thing...

215
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,910
Finally I got mad, and they got
all dramatic about it, turned into a huge fight...

216
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,470
You really hit them where they lived, ha?

217
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,270
Yeah. They always encouraged me to think
from myself, have a reason to believe things...

218
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,350
Except when it comes to God.

219
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,240
I guess...

220
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,370
But that's not the worst part...

221
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,970
It gets worse?

222
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,890
I can't believe I'm telling somebody this.

223
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,870
This is gonna sound really stupid,
make that beyond stupid... times 1000 ...

224
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,380
Hah! That's must be pretty bad.

225
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,888
It is.

226
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,940
After the three of us argued all night,
I went to bed, and then when I was almost asleep,

227
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,730
mom comes into the room, and closes the door,

228
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,710
then she sits on my bad, and she tells me,
that she used to feel the same way I did.

229
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,290
Like she wasn't so sure that god existed
until... until...

230
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,440
Until... what?

231
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,100
Until the night 10 years ago, when she actually
sat down to dinner with Jesus...

232
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,670
...at a tiny restaurant in Chicago.

233
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,310
Hmm, that something, we don't hear every day...

234
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,730
Then she went on saying, how that experience changed
her life, and it helped change dad's life, too...

235
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,500
And suddenly my nice, wonderful mom goes to church
seemed more like this:

236
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,770
psycho-religious fanatic,
seeing the pope's face in pancake better.

237
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,020
And that just added to the tension...

238
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,550
Well, between that little doozie being out of
the bag and me trying to find a school,

239
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,670
everything's just got all juiced up.

240
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,970
Like how?

241
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,500
Like all she wanna talk about is Jesus,

242
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,320
and how it was important to her and dad, that I was firm
in my faith before went out to the world, and stuff...

243
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,630
Oh, boy...

244
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,660
In less then 12 hours
my perfect relationship with my folks

245
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,770
got messed up because of
this stupid religion stuff.

246
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,550
Religion always messes everything up.

247
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,910
I hate religion.

248
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,900
So why do you hate religion?

249
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,420
Why, don't you?

250
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,100
Well, I'm not saying, people don't have the right
to believe  in what they want,

251
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,181
I'm just saying, it's not for me.

252
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,470
But you were the one who actually said,
you didn't like it...

253
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,640
Religion keeps people from living
the life to the fullest.

254
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,370
And makes some people to feel guilty over things
they shouldn't feel guilty about...

255
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,840
and other people worry about things,
they shouldn't worry about.

256
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,940
I know! Religious people are so uptight!

257
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,993
It's been so much time and
energy trying to please a higher power

258
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:17,350
and it's all wasted effort.

259
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,050
I think, they are focused on
feeding the Poor or something.

260
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,920
Lot of times they do.

261
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,630
But the problem is when they think,
they get points for doing good deeds.

262
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,270
or for what they wear,
or they eat, or they chant.

263
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,780
These things happen all over the world.

264
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,200
It seems, that the American Christians
have their own special set of rules:

265
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,485
like no movies, no dancing, no cards...

266
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:42,220
No alcohol.

267
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,180
I have a friend, whose mom doesn't
even let her eat rum-cake.

268
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:51,110
What is on the inside a person is what matters,
not the outside rituals.

269
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,310
What about those poor women you see on TV?

270
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:58,220
In Afghanistan they have to
wear that ugly burka things.

271
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,470
And the thing is: most of these
women just want to dress modestly,

272
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,290
but lot of them get beaten,
because they don't have everything covered.

273
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,450
That's so evil.

274
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,540
The men are afraid, that the women
will make them lust.

275
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,320
I shouldn't tell you this,
because you are so young, but...

276
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,540
You can dress a woman in concrete blocks,
and men would still find a way to lust after her.

277
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,741
Sounds like one of my dad's speeches.

278
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:25,580
The trouble is with: what is inside men's hearts,
not with what's on women's bodies.

279
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,090
Controlling women is just another way
for some men to exercise dominance.

280
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,290
I've heard, there is a church in the neighboring
village, that doesn't even let women speak.

281
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,560
I always wanted to walk in one Sunday morning,

282
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,370
and give them one big ear and say, what it is like!

283
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:45,140
I'm pretty upset, when I see religion
used as an excuse for slavery,

284
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,960
and discrimination, war...

285
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,650
Religion causes so much superstition
and ignorance in the world.

286
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,660
The trouble is: when religion
makes some people think,

287
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,680
that they have to run away from it,
before they can live a normal life.

288
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,930
Yeah, you are right!

289
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,920
Back where I come from
religion and hypocrisy went hand in hand.

290
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,740
People claimed to be one thing,
but actually showing another.

291
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
Really? What did they do?

292
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,190
The self-righteous leaders were
only focused on the rules.

293
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,280
And then they would lay these rules on the people,
who felt guilty, when they couldn't keep them well enough.

294
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,020
Where did you grow up?

295
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,740
In little town, East.

296
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,460
Small towns are probably
the worst for things like that.

297
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,540
- Water?
- Yes.

298
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,340
What language was that?

299
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,150
They are from Calcutta (USA).

300
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,760
The gentleman was telling to his wife,
that she shouldn't eavesdrop us.

301
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,620
But I told her it's alright, I didn't mind.

302
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,150
So you speak Cul...cattian?

303
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,380
I've spent some time there.

304
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,410
So what else bugs you in religion?

305
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,580
The way well-mean people
get all distorted by it.

306
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,990
Like how?

307
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:17,290
Like they stop being who they really are,
start trying to keep a lot of impossible rules,

308
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,760
and meanwhile they feel guilty,
and they feel miserable.

309
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,420
Wow, that sounds familiar...

310
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,000
And what make the matter worse, they start
distancing themselves from people in their lives,

311
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,720
sometimes from those who mean the most to them.

312
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,500
Yeah, but why is that?

313
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,650
Well, they are afraid that people, who don't
believe the way they do, will lead them astray.

314
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,470
So when you think about it: Instead of making
them more loving, religion actually causes them

315
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,820
to isolate themselves from the people
they really care about.

316
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,970
Stephany, that's my best friend.
She and I had a friend like that.

317
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,290
Three of us were really close
like since the 1st grade,

318
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,430
but when we went to high-school
she became super-religious.

319
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:02,160
Yeah, I mean, we all went to church together,
but Melissa took it extra serious.

320
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,210
And how that affected the "3 stooges"?

321
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,520
That's funny, that's everybody used to call us.

322
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,230
Well, after her religious conversion,
she didn't want much to do with Steph and me.

323
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,970
All what she had: the youth group friends. *

324
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,730
Hmm. That's a shame.

325
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,780
That's exactly, what I'm talking about.

326
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,370
The three of us thought, that we would be
friends forever...

327
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,560
I barely talked to her a whole school year. *

328
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,880
And now you are afraid you
loose your mom the same way...

329
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,970
Yeah...

330
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,950
Or I mean, I guess.

331
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,200
What are you,
like a shrink (psychiatrist) or something?

332
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,380
More like a counselor...

333
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,030
- Oh, gosh, I didn't...
- I'm sorry...

334
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:44,170
It's just... the thing with your mom
seems like the same situation. That's all.

335
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,510
I guess...

336
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:52,820
I mean, it's one thing to loose a girlfriend,
two is your family. It's a whole other thing.

337
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,810
It doesn't sound, like you really want to be in the other
side of the country away from your mom and dad...

338
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,280
Oh... Getting accepted to the Art Institute
would be a dream come true.

339
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,300
It's something I always wanted
since I was a little girl.

340
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,900
But the way things are now, I doubt
I'll ever come home for a visit.

341
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,850
Except like Christmas,
when there is no getting out of it.

342
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,410
But that's just not the way I ever thought
I will feel about my parents.

343
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,370
Do you blame all this on religion?

344
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,150
I just want our family to stay together,
like we always have been.

345
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,370
But this whole Jesus thing is
what is pulling us apart.

346
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,620
Alright...

347
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,870
Well, maybe though all those years you were
just playing church for their sake,

348
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,720
your mom and dad were
tapping into something deeper.

349
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
But why? My mom and dad
are both successful.

350
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,500
We have never had to
worry about money.

351
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,240
I guess your heart needs to be filled
something else...

352
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,000
Like what?

353
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,950
Good question!

354
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,410
If you figure that out,

355
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,530
may change what you feel
about them right now.

356
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,320
Sir, the plane landed.

357
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,510
Sir, it's time to get up, we landed.

358
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,160
Hey!

359
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,100
Hey, thanks for listening all my junk.
You really gave me lot to think about.

360
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,530
I'm glad. I enjoyed our conversation.

361
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,490
You know, I overheard earlier what
the two you were saying about religion.

362
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,990
What a shock!

363
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,980
And I agree with some of what you said,
all the stupid stuff about religion.

364
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,710
I mean, I go to the movies.
Not the R-rated ones, of course...

365
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,170
Well, except for the "Passion of the Christ".
You saw that?

366
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,100
Yeah.

367
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,510
Wasn't that the bloodiest thing
you've ever seen? *

368
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,920
Anyway...

369
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,910
I know, some people
get carried away with rules.

370
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,210
But I think, you are wrong when you say,
that religion stops people from enjoying life.

371
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,650
In my experience, religious people
(Christians - I mean), enjoy life the most.

372
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,065
I'm not trying to be pushy, I just think,
the two of you should consider that...

373
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,590
Hallelujah!

374
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,040
Hey, he means well.

375
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,610
Are you sure?!

376
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,770
- Is this yours?
- Yes, thanks.

377
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,100
- Take care yourself!
- You, too.

378
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,480
Can I help you?

379
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,220
Yes. I'll have a grande non-fat vanilla latte
with sugar free whipped cream...

380
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,220
...and a double French scone.

381
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,120
Ok, wait right over there.

382
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,140
Thanks.

383
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,960
I'd like a large coffee of the day,
and a piece of coffee-cake, please.

384
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,650
- Hi again!
- Hi. You've got a layover?

385
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,990
- Yeah. How about you?
- About an hour.

386
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,910
$9.14, please.

387
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,920
Here. Take that with this.

388
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,590
- No, you can't do that!
- Forget it...

389
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,430
You worked hard for
that babysitting money.

390
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:07,254
Thanks!

391
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,230
- Do you mind, if I sit with you?
- Not at all!

392
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,050
Did you find something good
to read in the bookstore?

393
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,500
How do you know,
I went to the bookstore?

394
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,590
Here are your bookstore bag...

395
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,390
Oh. Yeah, just a couple of magazines.

396
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,050
Do you mind, if I ask you a stupid question?

397
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,400
Sincere questions are never stupid.

398
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,500
Shoot!

399
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:23,837
Well...

400
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,060
Do you think, it is possible for
someone to connect personally with...

401
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,160
...you know, God?

402
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,090
Why do you ask?

403
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:39,990
You gonna think, this is really dumb, especially after
all the religion stuff we talked about on the plane.

404
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,420
Try me!

405
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,380
Well, after we talked,
I just started thinking about mom and dad,

406
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,389
and how we started going to church
like all of a sudden, when I was 10.

407
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,261
Aha...

408
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:57,100
And I started thinking, what if, mom really
did have some personal encounter with God...

409
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,610
or Jesus, whoever.

410
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,500
Well I know this sounds
pretty preposterous...

411
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,250
Not really...

412
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,140
But you don't even believe in God.

413
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,850
The thing is, you mom does. So it seems
to me, that makes it worth thinking about.

414
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,620
So back to my question:
do you think it is possible?

415
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,520
What do you think?

416
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,700
Well, saying, I am not even sure
there is a God...

417
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,190
Are you saying you don't believe in God,
or you don't know about the possibility of God?

418
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,870
I guess, I just don't know, what to think.

419
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,580
So you think at least
it might be possible that there is God?

420
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,470
- Well, yeah, I guess it is possible.
- Alright.

421
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:39,570
Let's just assume there is and go from there.
Maybe we can figure something out.

422
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,360
- Well, ok.
- Alright.

423
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,460
So if there is a God, do you think, it would be
possible for a person actually to connect with Him?

424
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,900
No, I don't.

425
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,200
He'd be way too big and powerful
for people to relate to him.

426
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,900
It would be like an ant trying to connect with us.

427
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,090
Good point.

428
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,820
- But what if we looked at it from the other side?
- How do you mean?

429
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,800
- I mean, from God's viewpoint.
- Like: could God relate to us?

430
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,030
More like: would He want to?

431
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,040
No, it's the same answer.

432
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,890
If there is a God, and He, or She, or whatever,
could create the whole Universe...

433
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,200
and if we are just these little nothings
on one little planet...

434
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,542
what use could He possibly have for us?

435
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:22,916
It's a good question.

436
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:26,110
I mean, don't you think, He would have
a lot more important things to deal with?

437
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,010
Yeah, you might think so...

438
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,270
What do you think, what would He be like?

439
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,300
How do you mean?

440
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,750
I mean, would He just create everything,
and let it go and watch it from a distance?

441
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:44,590
Or you think, He would be like an "involved being",
who thinks and feels, loves, just like we do?

442
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,350
Who knows? I mean, it's not like,
that He is into making appearances.

443
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,550
Alright.

444
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,310
I guess, we can figure that out,
when we go by the clues.

445
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,960
What clues?

446
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,560
Oh, for starters...

447
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,830
What would we know about someone who
has supposedly created the Universe?

448
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,320
Well, He'd have to be really-really old,
but in good shape.

449
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,970
Why good shape?

450
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:14,740
If you live to be a billion-years-old, I doubt,
that you would age the same as anybody else.

451
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,500
Alright. So God would have to be really old,
and in good shape.

452
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,490
What else?

453
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:27,990
He would have to be really smart, to invent things
like cells, DNA, the solar system...

454
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,930
Ok, so God would have to be super intelligent.

455
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,440
And powerful...

456
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,660
like... if the Big-Bang really happened,

457
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,900
then He would have to be the one who made it happen
and make sure that all worked out.

458
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,430
Ok, so God would have to be
really old, really smart and really powerful...

459
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,920
or at least as powerful
as the Universe itself, right?

460
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,430
Oh, yeah, if He is the one who created it,
He would have to be.

461
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,890
Because the creation shares traits
with the Creator, right?

462
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, it's a good way to put it.
It can be like me and my paintings.

463
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,780
Good analogy.

464
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,440
Now, let's take all the Universe-stuff
and apply it to people.

465
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,410
You just lost me...

466
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,340
Look at this way:
People are the part of the Universe, right?

467
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,620
Supposedly the highest intelligence on Earth.

468
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,240
- Well, most people...
- Right.

469
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,990
So just like God shares traits with the Universe,

470
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:20,210
What human traits - do you think - are
reflecting God?

471
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,110
Would you mind doing (answering) this one,
because my brain is getting tired...

472
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,040
Alright...

473
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,430
If people are the highest form in His creation,

474
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,220
then it makes sense that
they resemble who God is.

475
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,010
I guess, that sounds logical.

476
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:42,150
So things like, our minds, our motions,
our ability to choose,

477
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:46,510
all these human characteristics
reflect the God who created them.

478
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,290
But wait a minute!
Most people treat each other like dirt.

479
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,320
Are you saying, that's how God is?

480
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,120
Hmm... That's a though one (question).

481
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,740
But don't you think, these happen
because evil exists in the world?

482
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:06,740
I mean, is evil a part of God,
or is it something just went wrong somewhere?

483
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,390
I don't know...
But an evil God would be pretty scary.

484
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,580
The world is scary enough as it is.

485
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,960
Trains are blowing up,
and kids getting shot in school...

486
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,990
Yeah. It's frightening.

487
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,000
So you are pretty close to your folks, right?

488
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,930
Well, up till last night.

489
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,890
- Do you have picture of them?
- Let me see...

490
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,920
Yeah, a real "recent" one.

491
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,520
We never much liked
the family portrait thing.

492
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,180
- Still a good looking family you have.
- Thanks.

493
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:48,020
So what was your relationship
like before the blow-up?

494
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,120
What it always has been, you know...
Parents... with rules,

495
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,520
and curfews, and grounding me... But they
have always been my friends at the same time.

496
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,580
Really?

497
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,230
Yeah, I'm an only child, so I never had to
fight for attention with anyone.

498
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,150
- Until now.
- Right, until now.

499
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,940
So go on. Tell me about them.

500
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,780
Well, I'm sure, dad always wanted a boy,
but he never really let it showed.

501
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:19,130
We always loved memorizing mc Cub's betting
averages, how many games back they worth *

502
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,840
He enjoyed seeing me in a Buckerster's (sport dress) *
just as much as in a prom dress, or probably more so...

503
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,000
And nobody could ever
make me feel as safe as...

504
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,740
as I felt when I was with dad.

505
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,630
Hmm... What about mom?

506
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,680
Stephany has been my girlfriend
since grade school, but mom...

507
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,280
Mom has really been my best friend.

508
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,340
She is a lawyer...

509
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,720
And she is the kind of mom, that all
the guys in the class think she is hot.

510
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,870
So I have been always so proud of her,
and wanted to be like her.

511
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,590
She always loved taking me shopping,

512
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,010
and telling me how pretty I look in new outfits.

513
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,300
She always encouraged me in my art-work.

514
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:12,330
She cries with me, when a boy breaks my heart,
and she strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

515
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,340
And now you feel betrayed, because you think, they
may actually found someone they love more than you.

516
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,630
- Like who?
- Like God.

517
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,660
- That's stupid.
- Is it?

518
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,450
Yeah, I feel betrayed.

519
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:36,800
- Maybe little jealous?
- Yeah.

520
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,200
Let's go back to what you say it was a
perfect relationship with your folks.

521
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,770
If there is a God, who created the Universe
and everybody in it,

522
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:52,930
don't you think it is possible, that He would feel
the same about people as your parents do about you?

523
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:58,520
In other words: is it possible,
that the love your parents have for you

524
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,180
is a reflection of God,
who created them?

525
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,470
I don't know, I have never thought about that way.

526
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:09,200
Let me ask you this: Do you think
it is possible, that a person's desire

527
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,490
to connect with God
might actually come from Him?

528
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,650
- Come from Him?
- Yeah...

529
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,870
Like He placed the desire within them,
because He is actually the one, who wants it?

530
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,471
You mean, the people are designed that way?

531
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:24,900
Without Him they are be uncompleted.

532
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,440
I don't know, I guess, it is possible.

533
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,260
Well, if that was the case,

534
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,180
then would a person's desire
to connect with God be nonsense?

535
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,770
Or would it make the most sense?

536
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:42,060
Hold on for a second! You are starting
to sound like you actually believe in God.

537
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,660
I do.

538
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,480
But on the plane you said, you didn't.

539
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,400
- No I said: I hate religion.
- What is the difference?!

540
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,470
Religious people attempt to get to God
with good behavior and rituals.

541
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,320
As far as I believe in God? Of course I do.

542
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,420
So let me guess...

543
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,160
You do think, it is possible for someone
to connect personally with God?

544
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,800
Yeah. I know it is!

545
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,250
I can't believe I fell for this.
You are just like the window-seat guy!

546
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,880
Worse! Here I am telling you
all these personal things about my life,

547
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,850
and you just sitting here...
waiting to get me to this "knowing God" pitch.

548
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,480
Look, I wasn't trying to trick you.

549
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,320
You said, you want to figure out,
where you parents' beliefs are coming from.

550
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:19,870
I was.

551
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:23,920
Well, you wouldn't found out much,
if I give my perspective right off the bat.

552
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,550
You would have shut me down
just like you did the window-seat guy!

553
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,140
So?!

554
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,740
So?! Look at what you have managed
to come up with all of your own!

555
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,860
I just helped you to form the questions.

556
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,770
I guess you did help a little...

557
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:44,700
- I mean, you are a counselor.
- Absolutely.

558
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:51,010
- This had better be a free session!
- Totally free. It's the only way I work.

559
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,720
Alright then.

560
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,585
So, if even there are people
on this spiritual pursuit

561
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:03,870
do all of them hallucinate until thinking
they have actually sat down to dinner with Jesus?

562
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,350
I mean, have you ever heard anyone to say that?

563
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,010
I would admit, it has been a while.

564
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,480
So you are not saying it actually happened?

565
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,550
Only you can decide for yourself whether
you believe your mom's story or not.

566
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,410
I was just trying helping you to figure out that
a desire for a relationship with God is reasonable.

567
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,310
And you think it is?

568
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,420
Yeah, of course I do! But I also can't
make up your mind for you.

569
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,020
Yeah, you are right...

570
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,570
Something you said earlier,

571
00:44:33,788 --> 00:44:37,783
that people were designed to have
this intimate relationship with God

572
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:40,940
and that is the only way they can be fulfilled.

573
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,750
That's not true.

574
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,890
Really?

575
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,300
So you think people can be
completely satisfied with other things?

576
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,470
Yeah. Lot of people have fulfilled lives
that even don't go to church.

577
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,020
- Are you one of them?
- No... But I'm not everybody.

578
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,740
You are more everybody than you think.

579
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,700
Ok...

580
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:05,455
So I feel fulfilled, when I draw,
especially when I paint.

581
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:09,020
So, you feel fulfilled as an artist

582
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,500
Yeah, for the most part.

583
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,630
But not as a daughter.

584
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,175
No...
Today that doesn't rank too high on the scale.

585
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:18,490
Any idea, why it is?

586
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,730
Because I feel like,
we are from different planets.

587
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:25,890
because we are on opposite
ends of this God's stuff.

588
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,190
Yeah?

589
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:32,160
Yeah. I keep thinking I'm gonna come home
and find them watching some faith hero on TV

590
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,110
slapping people on the foreheads.

591
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:39,960
Well, let's say, that your art work is
hanging somewhere in Paris,

592
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,810
and everything is all peachy and cool
with your folks.

593
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,820
Would that satisfy you?

594
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,030
It would help.

595
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:49,030
Would the deepest part of you be filled?

596
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,400
I am not sure.

597
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,180
Alright, let's add some things to them:

598
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,720
How about a new Porsche?
Penthouse studio in New York city?

599
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,970
Would you get warmed?
Would you feel fulfilled?

600
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,300
I am not sure how to answer that.

601
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,400
The answer is: No!
You wouldn't be.

602
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,010
Because only God can completely
fulfill the human heart.

603
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,650
See, I don't believe that.
I see happy people all the time.

604
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,680
Really?
How well do you know them?

605
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,680
They may have meaningful aspects of their
lives just like you,

606
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,070
but deep down they are totally not fulfilled.

607
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,480
Believe me, it's not that hard to put on a
happy face for (the sake of) other people.

608
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,970
I still say, you are wrong.
Lots of people get fulfillment out of

609
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:32,530
their job, or relationships or causes.

610
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:35,010
Is that really what you think?

611
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,400
Just look at the society!

612
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,290
Look at the things people try to
fill their lives with!

613
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:44,460
Things like: alcohol, sex, food, work, gambling...

614
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,000
The list goes on and on and on...

615
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,910
and all points to the same conclusions:

616
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:53,490
That nothing on this planet can totally
fulfill the human soul.

617
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:56,840
- Not everybody is addicted to something.
- Of course, not.

618
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,690
But even the positive things
don't totally fulfill the heart.

619
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,000
- Which ones do you talking about?
- Name it...

620
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,810
Things like parenting, and happy marriages,
philanthropy (charity), public service...

621
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,060
When lot of these people
get to the end of their lives,

622
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,190
they still say, they are not totally fulfilled.

623
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,890
- How do you know that?
- Oh, for starters: They tell me.

624
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,970
They may not say anything to other people,
but when no one else is listening, they tell me.

625
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,470
Why is that?
Just because you are a counselor?

626
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,800
I guess it has something to do with it.

627
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,050
What exactly do they say?

628
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,680
They say that, the good experiences
they've had were not enough.

629
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,810
They lived a good life, but deep down
there is still this emptiness in their heart.

630
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,470
- How do you explain that?
- Oh, it is really simple.

631
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:44,610
How in the world is your heart gonna be
fulfilled by something or someone

632
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:49,450
which is just as finite and
imperfect like you are?

633
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,130
I've never thought that way.

634
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,120
For people wanna connection
with God - like your parents - maybe

635
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:01,840
will make some difference is the fact, if they
realize, there has to be something more and bigger,

636
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,740
that goes beyond the realm of
the logical and physical world.

637
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:10,830
And I know that you are looking
for something more, too.

638
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,770
You just don't know it, yet.

639
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:16,380
I just want things to be normal and happy.

640
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,000
There is just only one problem with that:

641
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,920
They probably won't be.

642
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,870
Thanks!
That's just what I needed to hear.

643
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,030
Life is like this, kiddo.

644
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,260
Even if a few things are bright up for a day,

645
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,100
tomorrow still will come with
its own set of stress and disappointment.

646
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,500
Or worse...

647
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,480
even loosing a friend, or a family member,
or even your own health.

648
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,694
Sure, I know these things could happen,

649
00:48:37,694 --> 00:48:41,617
but you can't go around basing your life on the
possibility that these things might come true.

650
00:48:41,617 --> 00:48:43,283
Possibility?!

651
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:46,900
The fact is, most of these things
will come true for everybody.

652
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,990
But the other truth is,

653
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:52,237
that there is one thing, that no one
can ever take away from you,

654
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:57,720
and once you find your fulfillment there,
you won't ever loose it.

655
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,990
- Come on! We'd better get going.
- What is your hurry?!

656
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,470
Our flight is boarding.

657
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:06,510
- Our flight?!
- Yeah. Still going to Portland, aren't you?

658
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,800
Are sure? I thought we had another 20 minutes.

659
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,070
- It's boarding now.
- But how do you know?

660
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,100
Trust me!
Do you need help with your bag?

661
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,309
Wait, wait.
You are going to Portland, too?

662
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:18,920
Yeah. Do you need help with your bag?

663
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,050
No, I got it.

664
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,660
So I haven't figured out,
how you knew, the plane was boarding.

665
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,900
Thanks.

666
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,810
Again, you gave me a lot of
things to think about.

667
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,760
And again, it was my pleasure.

668
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,300
Oh, come on!

669
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,390
What?

670
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:17,010
Well, don't you think, it is a little strange
sitting right next to each other two flights in a row?

671
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,980
Not really.

672
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:28,380
You know, we have discussed my family,
my personal life and the meaning of the Universe...

673
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,550
- Yeah.
- And we haven't even met yet.

674
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,980
No, we haven't!

675
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:37,110
- I'm Sarah.
- Hi Sarah! You can call me Yesh.

676
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,090
- Yesh?
- Aha.

677
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,782
It's hebrew.

678
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,600
What is, one of your parents is Jewish or something?

679
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,250
Aha.

680
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:50,650
- Well, hi Yesh, nice to meet you.
- Same here.

681
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,540
- Do you live in Portland?
- Nope. Going for business.

682
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,420
- What kind of business?
- My Father and I ran a "management operation".

683
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,520
- What do you manage?
- Pretty much. Everything.

684
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,599
Not big on specific... Sorry.

685
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,460
Sorry...

686
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,530
- I thought, you said, you are counselor!
- I am.

687
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:14,170
- Do you do that on the side?
- No it's part of the same operation.

688
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,020
Drawing again?

689
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,320
Writing.

690
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,520
What are you writing?

691
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,590
Some of my favorite words.

692
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,100
Like what?

693
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,300
Mostly poetry...

694
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,994
Poetry? You write poetry?

695
00:51:51,994 --> 00:51:54,065
Actually somebody else wrote it...

696
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,100
Can I see it?

697
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:57,990
Sure.

698
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,990
Have you ever read free verse?

699
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,570
A little.

700
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:07,470
<i>"I have loved you with a love that never ends.</i>

701
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:11,570
<i>Though the mountains must be shaken,
and the hills be removed, </i>

702
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:15,910
<i>yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken.</i>

703
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,050
<i>How could I give up on you?
My heart is turned over within me"</i>

704
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,810
It's pretty good stuff. Who wrote it?

705
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,060
My Father.

706
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,560
You are kidding! Who did he write it for?

707
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,730
For a relationship He had,

708
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,740
what He desperately wanted back.

709
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,970
Wow!

710
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,300
He must have been head over heels in love!

711
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,950
It's an understatement...

712
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:44,240
As a matter of fact, it's the exact same
way, God wants to love you.

713
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:49,550
So tell me, why I don't feel loved by Him?

714
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,020
Because you can't really
hear His voice right now.

715
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,750
Nobody can it first.

716
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,820
Yeah? And why is that?

717
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,790
Because people turned their back on God.

718
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,350
They had been deaf to His voice ever since.

719
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:03,160
No, no, no!
That's just a little too convenient:

720
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,280
you say, we are all deaf to God.

721
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,010
I say, that's proof: He doesn't exist.

722
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,570
Oh, but they are not entirely deaf!
They can hear His voice, but...

723
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:14,680
just not as clearly as
if they were connected with Him.

724
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,890
For example?

725
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,810
For example...

726
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,510
The first time you mom and dad
laid eyes on you,

727
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:26,560
and they couldn't believe that they could
love anything so much - That was God speaking.

728
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,120
When you stand at edge of the Lake Michigan,

729
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,280
and you feel so small next to
something so big,

730
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,790
and you just know, there has to be something
greater than yourself in the world:

731
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,030
That God's speaking again.

732
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,400
And when you snap at your mom,
and later on you feel guilty:

733
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,690
That's God again
speaking through your conscience.

734
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,670
- It is?
- Yeah.

735
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:52,680
Because deep down you know,
you weren't meant to live that way.

736
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,510
Even if that is true,
I can't help how I feel sometimes.

737
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:56,720
I know.

738
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,890
I am just telling what it is like,
when God speaks to your heart.

739
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,740
Giving you small glimpses
what it is like to hear Him clearly.

740
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,960
But how can that be?

741
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,620
Seems like a conversation with God
would be class-A boring.

742
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,970
Boring?

743
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:13,490
Believe me, Sarah, God is anything but boring.

744
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,670
He is the one who you get
the greatest joy and pleasure from.

745
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,520
Pleasure from God? Give me a break!

746
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,400
I mean, I can understand when people
want to believe in God, but...

747
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,510
Have you ever heard the hypothetical question:

748
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:27,650
<i>"If you could hang out
anybody from history, who would it be?"</i>

749
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:28,770
Yeah.

750
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:35,540
What if, if you could sit down with one
who actually carved out the Grand Canyon?

751
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,814
The One who raised up the Rocky-Mountains...

752
00:54:38,814 --> 00:54:42,537
The One, who wrote the code for DNA,
and designed language...

753
00:54:42,537 --> 00:54:46,580
The One, who made the stars,
and every new born implant.

754
00:54:47,514 --> 00:54:51,356
and the One who loves you with no limitations?

755
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:56,282
That all sounds great, but God just doesn't
drop in on people, does He?

756
00:54:56,282 --> 00:54:57,750
Maybe.

757
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,360
But what I am saying is that

758
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,290
God is infinitely more amazing than
anything or anyone He has ever created.

759
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:08,340
But if someone did want to touch God,
(I mean, if there is a God)

760
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,540
then how would they even
know how to start?

761
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:14,160
They don't have to.
He has already started the process.

762
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,310
He is reaching out for you.

763
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,060
That's the whole reason that He became a person.

764
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:26,320
Maybe if I actually sat down to dinner with Jesus, like
my mom said she did, then maybe I could believe, too.

765
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,160
Faith is lot easier, than you think, kiddo.

766
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,960
And we really don't need for Jesus
to show up at a dinner table.

767
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,710
But what you do need, is let it go, whatever
it is, which keeping you from trusting Him.

768
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,280
Like what?

769
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,890
You tell me!

770
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:58,380
You really want to know what is keeping me from
trusting God and wanting to make a connection with Him?

771
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:10,000
When I was 16 years-old,

772
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,250
I was date raped at a party.

773
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,250
What happened?

774
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,560
It was Homecoming...

775
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,940
After the game there was a
party at this kid's house.

776
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:33,900
One of the players - he was a senior -
asked me, if would go with him...

777
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,470
And was thrilled,
he even knew my name!

778
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:43,100
The music was really loud,
and he started drinking.

779
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:48,790
And before I knew it, he had pulled me
into one of the bedrooms upstairs.

780
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:56,230
There were so many people there, that
none of my friends even noticed I was gone.

781
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:02,570
The only person I've ever told it was Stephany.

782
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,630
I made her swear not to tell anyone.

783
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,910
Mom and dad never found out.

784
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:11,550
They were on a cruise when it happened.

785
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,660
The guy did the same thing
to another girl 3 months later,

786
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,160
and she went to the police
and he got sent to jail.

787
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,710
After I was sure, I wasn't pregnant,

788
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:28,430
I just didn't think about it any more.

789
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:33,680
After a while I could almost pretend,
like it never happened.

790
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,380
So why don't you tell me:

791
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:47,750
How would I ever trust a God,
who let that happen to me?

792
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:54,110
Sarah, what happened to you is horrible.

793
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,810
And God hates it just as much as you do.

794
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,550
Then why didn't He stop it from happening?!

795
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,740
Tell me this:

796
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,820
Just how much of the world's
evil want you to stop right now?

797
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,590
How about, all of it?!

798
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,990
And then the world would be a good place, right?

799
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:17,976
Yeah.

800
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,470
No, it wouldn't...

801
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:26,110
In the grand scheme of things like this
would be just deckchairs of the Titanic.

802
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,740
I don't understand.

803
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,220
I know.

804
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,620
You can't begin to understand the big picture,

805
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:38,170
and how things have to happen in
the due course of time. God knows this.

806
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:41,830
This is the whole reason, He gave you faith.

807
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:48,950
Sarah, there is nothing I could say that
makes sense or take away your pain.

808
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:51,310
But I can tell you this:

809
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,580
God is at work.

810
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:58,390
Restoring people. Returning them to a safe
and loving relationship.

811
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,410
And I promise:

812
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:03,560
One day the Evil of the world
will be done away with.

813
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,380
and all what will be left is the Good.

814
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,810
What about the people that do the evil things?

815
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,710
The bad guys with be punished.

816
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,890
The Good will be rewarded.

817
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,940
All things will be reconciled.

818
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,630
I just don't understand why we have to wait.

819
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,850
Because when mankind turned his back on God,

820
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:41,320
it sent itself ridden into a world of evil.

821
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,180
Bringing people back is a slow,
person by person process.

822
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,790
And what about the people
who didn't ask to have bad things happen?

823
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,590
God knows about every horrible thing that happens,

824
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,350
and He knows what it does to people.

825
00:59:57,350 --> 01:00:01,510
I doubt that... How could He know
everything from up there?

826
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:03,940
Or from wherever He sits...

827
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,010
Is this, what you really think?

828
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,970
That God distances Himself
from people's pain?

829
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,020
That's what it seems like!

830
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,080
Sarah...

831
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,410
When people rejected God,
it was incredible painful for Him.

832
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:21,200
Imagine watching your own children
falling into well of darkness.

833
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,050
If it was so painful for Him, then why
didn't He do something to save us?

834
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,970
He did everything, it could be done.

835
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,280
Do you remember the window-seat guy
from the first plane?

836
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,540
How could I forget...

837
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:37,440
He talked about that movie:
"The Passion of the Christ". You saw it, right?

838
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,280
It's been a while, but yeah.

839
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,910
The torture that Jesus endured
only makes sense, if you realize

840
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:46,900
that was God taking
the punishment of all people.

841
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:51,500
He wanted to be reunited with them so much,
that He was willing to die for them.

842
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,170
But even if that did happen,
what good did it do?

843
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:59,390
The world is still screwed up.
And it's been 2000 years!

844
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,160
Look it this way:

845
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,130
God isn't slow.

846
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:06,820
He is patient.

847
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:11,980
He is waiting. He is giving second chances,
so no one is left behind.

848
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:18,690
What you perceive as God is
dragging his feet, is actually: mercy.

849
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,840
- Water?
- Thanks.

850
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:33,140
So if this big reconnection happens,
then what?

851
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:37,550
The same thing you do in any relationship:

852
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:40,540
You talk to each other.
You get to know Him.

853
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,710
Talk with Him? You mean pray?

854
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,240
Pray is a part of it...

855
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,150
But anyone can pray.

856
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:51,670
Yeah, but not everyone
can hear Him talk back.

857
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,140
Like He supposedly did with my mom.

858
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,710
For anybody wanting a connection with God,
listening is the crucial part.

859
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:02,430
So once you become religious,
you can automatically hear God's voice?

860
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:06,860
Religious would be the opposite.
Religion is mostly an outward thing:

861
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,910
Do this! Don't do that!
Go there! Don't go there!

862
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:16,290
A person who can hear God's voice is someone,
who has been changed from the inside out.

863
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,110
Changed like how? Like a new attitude?

864
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,750
No! Like a whole new spirit.

865
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,710
God gives it to you, when you connect with Him,
because the old spirit wouldn't work.

866
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:27,870
It couldn't connect,
it couldn't hear His voice.

867
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,860
Are you talking about audible voices here?

868
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,500
He doesn't need that.

869
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,190
He has other ways...

870
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,370
Like what?

871
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:40,450
Like a small voice in your conscious.
Like His written word.

872
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,380
Remember that piece you read earlier?

873
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,740
What, that poem?

874
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,590
Right out from the Bible.

875
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,280
But I thought, you said,
your father wrote it.

876
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,940
God is my father.

877
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,900
Ok...

878
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,930
and that poem came from the bible...

879
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,840
Why so hard to believe?

880
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,760
Because I always thought
about the Bible as a rulebook.

881
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,630
Rulebook?

882
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,800
Listen to this:

883
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:13,080
<i>"I've made myself one spirit with you
I nourish, I cherish you</i>

884
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:18,300
<i>I gave myself up for you,
I lay down my life for you"</i>

885
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,410
Does it sound as a rulebook to you?

886
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,753
No, it sounds more like a love letter.

887
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:24,770
You got it!

888
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:29,130
For people who can hear God's voice,
this is how He speaks to them through His Word.

889
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,410
That's how Jesus was when he was on Earth.

890
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,320
He was always listening to his Father's voice.

891
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:39,940
So real Christianity is just sitting
around all day and listening this stuff?

892
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,300
Not quite...

893
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,500
It's letting Him love
other people through you.

894
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:51,140
It's knowing, that you are forgiven.
It's knowing, that you are accepted.

895
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:55,460
No matter what, you always have
a special place in God's heart.

896
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:59,080
But what about the people who have
bad things happened to them?

897
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,950
When people - who have pain - connect with God,

898
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:06,590
they realize, there has never been a moment,
when He ever stopped loving them.

899
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:09,000
And they know, the day will come,

900
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,190
when He will personally wipe away every tear
and they will be never hurt again.

901
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:18,448
And when they're with God,
and they feel His enormous love,

902
01:04:18,448 --> 01:04:22,920
the pain, they once felt, seems like nothing.

903
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:26,310
What makes it enormous?

904
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,000
Because it is perfect.

905
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,420
You know...

906
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:04,590
I don't know if I'm ready to commit
to anything like my parents have,

907
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,570
like my mom did 10 years ago...

908
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:10,050
But all the stuff we have been talking about,

909
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,850
what exactly do I do with all this?

910
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:15,230
Well, first, you have to make a decision:

911
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:18,480
Do you want to experience perfect love?

912
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,460
Tell me again, what is perfect love?

913
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,900
It's a love, that's even greater than
your parents have for you...

914
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,870
Greater, than you'll have for
your own kids one day...

915
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:33,160
Once you make that decision,
He will lead you through what happens next.

916
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,710
Hmm.

917
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,390
You've got some eye.

918
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:44,280
Are you excited about touring the Art Institute?

919
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,680
Well... yes and no.

920
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,420
The truth is, I know, I am not going here...

921
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:53,950
I sent in my application 3 months ago,
and so haven't heard anything.

922
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:58,480
I am just using this visit as an excuse
to get away from my mom and dad for a while.

923
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:04,630
People from all over the world come to study
here, and I really don't have what it takes.

924
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:11,720
I'm sure, the coming Fall I will be taking
sculpture class at Deerfield Community College.

925
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,860
How many languages do you speak?

926
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,030
All of them.

927
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,800
- What do you mean: "all of them"?
- I mean, all of them.

928
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,710
- Say something in Chinese!
- Mandarin or Cantonese?

929
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:58,380
- Whichever!
- Shang di ai ni! (God loves you)

930
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:01,620
Oh, come on! Nobody can
speak every language!

931
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,260
I can!

932
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,750
I've had a lot of time to work on it.

933
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,050
Well, I guess, this time really is goodbye.

934
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,030
Yeah, I guess so.

935
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:17,860
And I am going to get some very
serious thought to - you know - listening. *

936
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,610
- Do you want to practice?
- Hm?

937
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,490
Check your messages when you get to the terminal.

938
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:28,150
And try to stay awake on art history. *

939
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:32,280
What?! What in the world are you talking about?!

940
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:45,580
Until next time...

941
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,700
Wait! What did you...?

942
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,100
Where did he go?

943
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,580
Hi Steph, it's me. Just landed...

944
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:47,180
I don't know, it's just a regular airport.

945
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,260
Yeah, I check my messages and then...

946
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,490
Check my messages...

947
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,990
Hi Steph, I call you back, bye-bye.

948
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:00,590
Come on, came on...

949
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,940
Have a message... come on...

950
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,900
Oh, my Gosh!

951
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,180
I've got into the College.
I have been accepted!

952
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:18,130
I've got a scholarship in the Art Institute!

953
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,180
I have been accepted!

954
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,830
How did he know?...

955
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,950
What are you, like a shrink or something?

956
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:41,620
More like a counselor...

957
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,370
How many languages do you speak?

958
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,430
All of them.

959
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,080
God is my father.

960
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,450
It's Him!

961
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,820
Wait!

962
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,850
You need a cab?

963
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:07,250
Yes, right coming back with my bags...

964
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,810
Hi, welcome to the Harriston.
My name is Kelly. Are you going to check in?

965
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,850
Yeah.

966
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:55,790
And what is your name on the reservation?

967
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:57,440
Cominskey.

968
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:02,240
Alright, Miss Cominskey,
I have you done for a single room

969
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,997
non-smoking for 2 nights,

970
01:13:03,997 --> 01:13:08,193
and you have a choice of the 1st floor
by the pool, or 3rd floor of the Atrium.

971
01:13:08,193 --> 01:13:09,450
I don't care.

972
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:10,930
Pool.

973
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:13,730
No! Atrium. Atrium.

974
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,040
Atrium it is.

975
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,010
Here you are.

976
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:59,730
<i>"My sheeps hear to my voice,
and I know them,</i>

977
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:02,220
<i>and they follow me,</i>

978
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:05,090
<i>and I give them eternal life."</i>

979
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,160
Mom? Hey, it's me.

980
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,100
Yeah. I got here just fine.

981
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,603
Listen, I've got tell you about the day I just had.

982
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:52,430
I think, I've met a man, an old friend of yours...
