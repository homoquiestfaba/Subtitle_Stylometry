1
00:00:01,346 --> 00:00:03,348
[silence]

2
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:08,041
[woman muffled scream]

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:13,047
[woman screaming]
[suspenseful music]

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,740
[woman sobbing]

5
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:22,504
[Mary Ann] Daddy!

6
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:23,505
Daddy!

7
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:27,578
Honey.

8
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:29,925
[Mary Ann] I heard a monster.

9
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:30,926
Uh-oh.

10
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:34,103
What did it, uh...

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,796
What did it sound like?

12
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,730
Was it like a bear?

13
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:44,974
[Mary Ann] No, it sounded
like a monster, a real one.

14
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,494
Oh, no.

15
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,083
Is Tilly scared?

16
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:53,397
[ominous music]

17
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,398
[Mary Ann] A little.

18
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:58,920
Well, what do we say?

19
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,166
One, two, three.

20
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,411
Nothing scares me.

21
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:09,378
Can you say it with me?

22
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,621
Okay.

23
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,348
[Father And Mary Ann] One,
two, three.

24
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,799
Nothing scares me.

25
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:17,973
Good.

26
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,045
You feel better?

27
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,184
[Mary Ann] Can you turn on the
light?

28
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:24,739
No, no, wait a minute.

29
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:29,054
I think, I know what's
really bothering you.

30
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,783
Mommy and I have been
fighting a lot lately.

31
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:36,440
And...
Daddy, I don't-

32
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:37,787
Let me finish, okay.

33
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:45,277
You just get so tired,

34
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:49,178
so frustrated when
things just don't

35
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,526
go the way you want them to.

36
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:57,495
You wanted a raise
not just a promotion.

37
00:01:57,496 --> 00:02:02,536
You wanted Henry to be
healthy for good this time.

38
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,987
You wanna give mommy the
life that you promised her

39
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:08,335
when you got married,

40
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,132
one with vacations, huh,

41
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,237
dinners out,

42
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:19,656
and not just to Olive
Garden or Applebee's.

43
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:22,659
Wanna know a secret?

44
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:25,558
I hate Applebee's.

45
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:29,044
Yeah, and you know what?
So does Mommy.

46
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,874
[tense music]

47
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:32,875
[Mary Ann] Daddy.

48
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:40,297
But, she knows that
that's the best we can do,

49
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:41,367
and she's a good woman,

50
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:45,199
so she doesn't say
how unhappy she is.

51
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:48,684
But I can tell.

52
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,518
In the way she looks at me,

53
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,039
the sigh she lets
out every morning.

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,801
She loves you, she loves Henry

55
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:03,216
there's no doubt about that.

56
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:08,188
But, I know that she stopped
loving me a long time ago.

57
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,537
And, you know, the truth is that

58
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,747
moms and dads don't
have to love each other

59
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:18,128
to stay together.

60
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,338
And sometimes, I think...

61
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:24,583
Sometimes it's gotta be better
that way.

62
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,102
It's gotta hurt less, right?

63
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:29,242
I mean, it must. [chuckling]

64
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,486
[sighing heavily]

65
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:34,005
There's no such thing as
monsters, honey.

66
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,905
Life is scary enough
without them.

67
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:38,251
[Mary Ann] But they are real.

68
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,115
I heard one.

69
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,255
They're as real as Tilly.

70
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,188
[Mary Ann] He's real.

71
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,533
Now we've talked about that.

72
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:46,086
[Mary Ann] He's a real doll.

73
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,366
You said that mom made
him with her love.

74
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:51,714
You know, you're right.

75
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:54,819
[Mary Ann] Can we
please turn on the light?

76
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,683
No, there's no...

77
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:58,098
[suspenseful music]

78
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:02,724
See, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

79
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:04,381
Nothing at all.

80
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:06,624
[chair creaking softly]

81
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,625
Jesus!

82
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:13,770
[suspenseful music]

83
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,843
[breathing heavily]

84
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:24,125
[tense music]

85
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,995
[breathing heavily]

86
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:40,176
[faucet water splashing]

87
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,696
One, two, three.

88
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,629
Nothing.

89
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,116
[shower water splashing]

90
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:55,467
[suspenseful music swelling]

91
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,483
You're a mess.

92
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,314
You wanna join me?

93
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:18,558
God, yes.

94
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:22,183
[gentle music]

95
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,161
I meant to pick up Henry's meds.

96
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,370
It's taken care of.

97
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,718
Do I need to pick up
Mary Ann at school?

98
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:41,719
No.

99
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,204
Not anymore.

100
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:47,311
Jess.

101
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:50,901
Don't.

102
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:55,837
There's this song
stuck in my head.

103
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:57,770
It's not really even a song.

104
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,703
[Father] I really screwed up.

105
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:01,361
God, what is it?

106
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,743
I'm so sorry.

107
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,201
[dad moaning softly]

108
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:23,727
That's it.

109
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,146
One, two, three.

110
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,564
My sweet pea went and
killed his whole family.

111
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,154
[ominous music]

112
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:40,779
We suffered, you know.

113
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:43,437
None of us went quickly,

114
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:46,750
not Henry,

115
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:47,855
not Mary Ann,

116
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,375
not even me.

117
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,241
You couldn't even do that right.

118
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:58,762
[Father] This isn't real.

119
00:06:58,763 --> 00:06:59,763
No.

120
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,042
No, it's not.

121
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:07,460
[gentle music]

122
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,602
[dad sobbing softly]

123
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:16,470
[suspenseful music]

124
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:50,746
[Mary Ann] Daddy, you
don't have to be alone.

125
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,543
[Jess And Mary Ann] You
can be with all of us.

126
00:07:58,616 --> 00:07:59,995
[Father] One,

127
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:00,996
two,

128
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:02,722
three.

129
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,519
I saw a monster,

130
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:08,141
and he was me.

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,801
[suspenseful music]

132
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:15,667

[soft knocking on door]

136
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:53,152
Hello.

137
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,131
[soft knocking on door]

138
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,132
Hello.

139
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:53,453
[loud banging on door]

140
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:55,042
Ugh, what the fuck!

141
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:05,018
[tense music]

142
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,400

[chuckling softly]

149
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,891
A stupid toy.

150

[suspenseful music]

151
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,762

161
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,485
No, please!

162
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:37,418
Oh, my god!

163
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:42,009

You motherfucker!

175
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:33,681
Go to hell!

176
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:40,067

[dramatic music]

185
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:18,106
[Jordan] Mom.

186
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,715
[John] So, you sure
I never mentioned

187
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:18,337
my friend Dennis to you before?

188
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:19,338
Yeah, I'm sure.

189
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:22,791
Maybe you were too
young to remember, huh?

190

00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,210
Chief Administrative
Official in a prison.

376
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:55,663
Hey, mom.

377
00:32:55,664 --> 00:32:57,629
[Alien] Parasite:

378
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,564
Plant or animal that
lives in or on an organism

379
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:04,085
from which it derives
sustenance or protection

380
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:09,539
without benefiting the host
and usually doing harm.

381
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:17,925
In time, these jailers
will take everything,

382
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:21,861
rob you of every
wish, hope, and desire.

383
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:30,146
It's up to you to make a plan
to break free, to escape.

384
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:33,528
After all these years,
I have my opportunity.

385
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:38,256
Four more months
the kids off to college.

386
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:41,052
Pull out the
savings, buy a truck,

387
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,090
leave, never look back.

388
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:47,300
After 45 years of existence,

389
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:49,819
my life is about to begin.

390
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,858
[utensils clanking]

391
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,626
What's the matter, sweetheart,

392
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,043
had another bad day?

393
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:08,735
Now you're waiting for
me to ask you about it,

394
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:12,325
but I won't because you're
just gonna tell me anyway.

395
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:13,705
Here it comes.

396
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:17,054
Three, two, one.

397
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,955
They're expecting me to
go in on Saturday again.

398
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:24,475
Can you believe that?

399
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:27,098
Well, they don't appreciate you

400
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:30,068
or your contributions
in that branch.

401
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:33,416
They really don't.

402
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:36,487
[Alien] Your contributions?

403
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:38,523
What exactly should they appreciate,

404
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:42,080
your GED or your half
year of community college?

405
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:47,014
You're on time every day,
so are my bowel movements.

406
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:48,740
You're a knot on a bolt

407
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:51,640
on the ass-end of a useless cog.

408
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:53,919
They should've
fired you years ago.

409
00:34:57,025 --> 00:34:59,580
[somber music]

410
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:08,244
Please don't touch me, you pig.

411
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:16,354
You okay?

412
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:18,701
Yeah.

413
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:22,843
Uh.

414
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,709
Well.

415
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,196
Well, what?

416
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,650
[Alien] We're having a
baby like it's nothing.

417
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,170
Like it won't ruin everything.

418
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,516
Anything but that.

419
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:41,966
You're dying.

420
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:43,209
You're leaving.

421
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,693
You're cheating.

422
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:46,282
Anything but that.

423
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:50,217
[humming softly]
Haven't you done enough,

424
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:52,357
taken everything.

425
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:56,463
You're enjoying this aren't you?

426
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:58,466
All a part of a plan, isn't it?

427
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
Checkmate.

428
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:04,437
She can lock the door,

429
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:06,509
and throw away the key now,
can't she?

430
00:36:08,856 --> 00:36:10,754
It's over again.

431
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,587
But it can't be over.

432
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:19,418
We've waited too
long to just give up.

433
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:24,389
There's a solution,
always a solution.

434
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:26,322
We can beat her.

435
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,670
You're smarter than her.

436
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,915
Get us out of this, John.

437
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:41,060
[dramatic music]

438
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:46,549
[computer mouse clicking]

439
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:32,457
What are you doing?

440
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,080
Hmm?

441
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:36,737
Go on, go on, no peeking.

442
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:38,808
Go.
Okay.

443
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,709
[Alien] Don't stop.

444
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,849
Almost there.

445
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,130
[toilet flushing]

446
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:55,549
[somber music]

447
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:28,374
You okay?

448
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,963
[Charlotte] Yeah.

449
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:32,895
Fine.

450
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:36,968
Good.

451
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:05,618
[sobbing gently]

452
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:08,242
[somber music]

453
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,533
[Alien] Brought it on herself.

454
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,468
Don't forget that, John.

455
00:39:38,997 --> 00:39:39,998
It's almost eight.

456
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:42,793
You getting up?

457
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:47,625
[somber music]

458
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:48,764
Hey.

459
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:49,766
[Charlotte] What?

460
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:53,631
What's wrong?

461
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:00,846
[Alien] Depression.

462
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,403
Oh, she's good.

463
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:08,751
Didn't see this
one coming, did we?

464
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:20,072
But we're on to her,
aren't we, John?

465
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:28,287
She can't act sick forever.

466
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:48,791
[Charlotte] Thanks.

467
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:53,208
[Alien] What an actress.

468
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:54,727
Think you've won, huh?

469
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:58,283
Fooled the kid, family,
the doctor, your boss.

470
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,871
But not me.

471
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:01,872
So,

472
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:05,600
I've been thinking.

473
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,360
[Alien] Is that
what you call it?

474
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:10,537
About how much this
whole thing's upset you.

475
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,816
Yeah, it's been tough.

476
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:17,715
But, sometimes things

477
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:19,615
there're just not meant to be.

478
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:23,894
I guess not.

479
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:33,491
But that doesn't mean we
can't try again, right?

480
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,079
[Alien] You see.

481
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,564
She'll never quit.

482
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:41,049
The depression thing was a ploy.

483
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,741
And now she's
going for the kill!!

484
00:41:43,846 --> 00:41:45,192
You know that, don't you?

485
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:47,711
She'll never stop.

486
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:52,439
Until her last egg is dried
up, she'll keep trying.

487
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,064
After that,
she'll want to adopt.

488
00:41:56,065 --> 00:41:57,135
It'll never end.

489
00:41:58,757 --> 00:42:01,863
But there's still
a chance for freedom,

490
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:04,107
for everything
we've dreamt about.

491
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:06,765
Leave it to me, John.

492
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:11,251
Mom's been acting funny.

493
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:12,633
Keep an eye on her, okay?

494
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:14,635
I'm worried about her.

495
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:20,848
I want you to keep an eye on
Mom, okay?

496
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:23,056
Why?

497
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,165
[Alien] Well, dear, the
pills, the depression,

498
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,892
I'm just afraid she might
do something stupid.

499
00:42:30,893 --> 00:42:31,997
She may hurt herself.

500
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:35,760
Go on.

501
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,794
I'm just not sure about

502
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:39,590
all those pills she's taking,
you know.

503
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,351
[Alien] Say it the
right way, idiot.

504
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:43,560
Say it.

505
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,253
I'm worried she
might hurt herself.

506
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,979
What are you doing?

507
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,257
Don't think, John, just follow.

508
00:42:51,258 --> 00:42:52,570
It's what you're good at.

509
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:06,617
Wake up, honey.

510
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,205
Have some tea.

511
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,587
It'll make you feel better.

512
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:15,178
Wake up, honey,
and have some tea.

513
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:18,629
What are you doing?

514
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,907
Pour the tea.

515
00:43:21,253 --> 00:43:22,253
John.

516
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:25,291
Don't do this.

517
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,639
Feed that bitch the tea.

518
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:34,093
[breathing heavily]

519
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:36,198
Get back in there.

520
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:38,167
Want another 20 years of hell?

521
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:45,207
You'll never have
this chance again!

522
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,589
We'll never get away from this
hell hole!

523
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,109
Do it!

524
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,317
Finish it!

525
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:52,733
Set us free!

526
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,393
Stop thinking it's not your
strong suit.

527
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:01,810
Let me take care
of this like always.

528
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:04,986
Don't start getting ideas now.

529
00:44:04,987 --> 00:44:07,160
Just do what comes naturally.

530
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:09,819
Give me control now!

531
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:14,133
No.

532
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:29,736
[dramatic music]

533
00:45:11,674 --> 00:45:13,538
[Alien] Stop it, don't touch me.

534
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,233
What are you doing?

535
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:22,891
Keep that thing away from me.

536
00:45:22,892 --> 00:45:25,999
[suspenseful music]

537
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,692
[soft knocking on door]

538
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:31,521
[Charlotte] What are you doing
in there?

539
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:33,660
[Alien] Don't do it.

540
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:35,629
[Charlotte] Why aren't you at
work?

541
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,183
Be right out, honey.

542
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:44,361
[Charlotte] Get it away from me.

543
00:45:44,362 --> 00:45:45,984
[Jordan] Dad, it's like 8:30.

544
00:45:47,054 --> 00:45:48,054
Dad!

545
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:52,266
Yeah, you take the car, honey.

546
00:45:53,474 --> 00:45:54,751
[Charlotte] Really?

547
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,789
Yeah, I'm gonna stay
at home this morning.

548
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,655
[Jordan] Alright, see you later.

549
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:08,835
[ominous music]

550
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:07,409
[Alien] Wait.

551
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:10,551
You're gonna kill us.

552
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:13,864
Stop, listen to me.

553
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:16,039
I've only ever wanted to make
you happy.

554
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,626
I'm not your enemy.

555
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:20,595
It's not my fault
they've disappointed you.

556
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:22,010
I wish they made us happy,

557
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:23,874
gave us everything you need.

558
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:26,014
But they don't, do they, John,

559
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:27,809
and they never will.

560
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,984
I'll never accept that.

561
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:33,504
[John gasping]

562
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:34,920
We can start over,

563
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:36,060
do things your way.

564
00:47:39,201 --> 00:47:40,787
Listen to me, John.

565
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:41,788
Calm down.

566
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:46,139
I'd never hurt you.

567
00:47:48,072 --> 00:47:50,971
I want the best for you, for us.

568
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,872
I understand you're scared,

569
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,390
but don't do this.

570
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:59,358
[gasping heavily]

571
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,601
You're not thinking it.

572
00:48:01,602 --> 00:48:03,120
Stop and think.

573
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:04,501
Listen to me.

574
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:07,815
We can fix this, fix everything.

575
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:11,646
Stop it.

576
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:13,579
Get your hands off me!

577
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,168
[suspenseful music]

578
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:17,411
Listen to me, John.

579
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:21,967
Undo the belt.

580
00:48:22,865 --> 00:48:25,004
Calm down, be reasonable.

581
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:27,110
We can talk this out.

582
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:29,872
You and I we've
always been together.

583
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:32,563
Let's not fight.

584
00:48:33,669 --> 00:48:35,773
That's right, John, relax.

585
00:48:35,774 --> 00:48:36,774
Think about it.

586
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:38,950
I'm your best friend.

587
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:42,056
I'm the one you know.

588
00:48:42,057 --> 00:48:44,093
No one knows you better.

589
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:46,613
No, John.

590
00:48:46,614 --> 00:48:49,236
Don't do this, John!

591
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,826
You'll bleed out.

592
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:56,070
You'll die.

593
00:48:56,071 --> 00:48:57,761
Don't do this.

594
00:48:57,762 --> 00:48:59,591
How will you explain this to
Jordan?

595
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:01,938
You can't do it.

596
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,906
You don't handle
pain well, John.

597
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:06,977
Do you know what
a razor feels like

598
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:09,014
being pulled across your flesh?

599
00:49:09,015 --> 00:49:11,568
[gasping heavily]

600
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:14,329
Idiot, you think this is the answer.

601
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,400
Pull it out now.

602
00:49:16,263 --> 00:49:18,264
Stop, look at the blood.

603
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:20,958
You're bleeding it's
not going to stop.

604
00:49:25,203 --> 00:49:28,033
Listen to me you can
still turn things around.

605
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:29,758
We can sew you up.

606
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:30,759
It's not too late.

607
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:34,556
What are you doing?

608
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:35,937
You don't understand what you're

609
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:38,734
getting yourself into,
you idiot.

610
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:43,118
[gasping heavily]

611
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:52,851
It's not gonna work, John.

612
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:59,478
You're gonna die alone in
this dark, filthy basement

613
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:01,377
like a rat, like an insect.

614
00:50:03,207 --> 00:50:05,139
You love me so much, don't you.

615
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,381
[John groaning heavily]

616
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:11,353
She's gonna remarry, get a
new daddy, bring another rat.

617
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:15,357
You bastard.

618
00:50:16,772 --> 00:50:19,602
[gasping heavily]

619
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:22,984
No one is going to remember you

620
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:24,780
because you didn't matter.

621
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,749
Because at all things you failed

622
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:32,822
took the easy way out.

623
00:50:38,345 --> 00:50:39,345
Traitor.

624
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:52,634
You can't get rid of me.

625
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:54,947
You're not going anywhere.

626
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:56,845
[Alien] I'm a piece of you.

627
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,332
Cutting me out
won't change that.

628
00:51:00,816 --> 00:51:04,130
[John grunting heavily]

629
00:51:07,926 --> 00:51:09,652
You wasted your life, John.

630
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,586
You didn't make a difference.

631
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:15,382
You failed your family,

632
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,523
failed in school,
failed in your career.

633
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:23,701
[grunting heavily]

634
00:51:26,048 --> 00:51:28,085
You're bleeding to death.

635
00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:31,088
You're going to die, John.

636
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:36,299
So are you.

637
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,268
[groaning heavily]

638
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:44,549
[Jordan] Dad, it's 8:30!

639
00:51:46,482 --> 00:51:48,138
Dad!

640
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:52,074
[footsteps running downstairs]

641
00:51:53,248 --> 00:51:56,043
[dramatic music]

642
00:52:32,908 --> 00:52:33,771
[suspenseful music]

643
00:52:33,772 --> 00:52:36,636
[woman screaming]

644
00:52:37,706 --> 00:52:39,672
[woman sobbing]

645
00:52:39,673 --> 00:52:42,538
[woman screaming]

646
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:48,836
Hon.

647
00:54:51,943 --> 00:54:53,807
Don't use up
all the hot water, okay.

648
00:54:54,636 --> 00:54:56,292
I need a shower too.

649
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,536
I skipped the shower at
the gym this morning.

650
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,091
James.

651
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:31,810
What are you doing?

652
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:33,432
He doesn't know anything.

653
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:36,056
You're just being
paranoid, relax.

654
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,244
So how was your weekend?

655
00:55:52,418 --> 00:55:53,729
It was

656
00:55:56,283 --> 00:55:57,283
amazing.

657
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:03,704
I worked out,

658
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:06,052
did some shopping,

659
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:11,885
had an extramarital
affair that's about it.

660
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,300
What about you?

661
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,582
You're disappointed in me.

662
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:23,241
I know it was wrong,
completely and utterly.

663
00:56:24,104 --> 00:56:29,109
But, at the time it felt right.

664
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:34,355
I mean, the guy was cute.

665
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:37,772
I was horny, and FYI,

666
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:40,188
a vibrator most definitely

667
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:42,812
isn't a replacement
for human contact.

668
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:46,230
So it happened.

669
00:57:00,106 --> 00:57:01,520
What are you doing here?

670
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:02,591
I sent a text.

671
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:06,043
I didn't get a text.

672
00:57:09,046 --> 00:57:09,943
Are you certain?

673
00:57:09,944 --> 00:57:12,462
'Cause I did hit send.

674
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:13,464
I'm very certain.

675
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:21,402
Well, anyway, I'm here now,

676
00:57:21,403 --> 00:57:23,956
so why don't you
invite me inside?

677
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:24,957
No.

678
00:57:27,374 --> 00:57:28,375
Does, uh...

679
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:34,657
Does he know about our
extracurricular activities.

680
00:57:34,658 --> 00:57:37,314
[chuckling softly]

681
00:57:37,315 --> 00:57:38,489
Extracurricular,

682
00:57:40,215 --> 00:57:41,215
I like that word.

683
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:45,772
I literally like how it
feels rolling about my mouth.

684
00:57:46,946 --> 00:57:48,775
Extracurricular.

685
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:51,190
Why don't you try it?

686
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:54,262
Look, I don't have
time for games.

687
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:57,438
So, if you don't mind,
please leave.

688
00:57:57,439 --> 00:57:58,439
Wow.

689
00:58:00,028 --> 00:58:03,099
Last week you
couldn't get enough,

690
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,102
and now you just
wanna see me go.

691
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:08,105
That's, uh...

692
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:10,693
That's a little rude,
don't you think?

693
00:58:10,694 --> 00:58:12,626
Do you want money, is that it?

694
00:58:12,627 --> 00:58:14,835
Oh, no, no, no.

695
00:58:14,836 --> 00:58:17,838
Money does not
take the shame away.

696
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:22,878
Somethings, they just
stay with you forever.

697
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:27,054
Look, I was lonely
and things happened.

698
00:58:27,055 --> 00:58:28,711
But I don't wanna
hurt my husband

699
00:58:28,712 --> 00:58:32,025
over a little indiscretion,
so please.

700
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,514
Oh, but there is sin
in your indiscretion.

701
00:58:39,757 --> 00:58:42,622
It molds to you
with great certainty.

702
00:58:46,592 --> 00:58:49,146
Please, let go of the door.

703
00:58:51,182 --> 00:58:52,459
Let go.

704
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:55,634
Fine.

705
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,325
I'll leave.

706
00:58:58,189 --> 00:58:59,674
But you'll be seeing me again.

707
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:02,192
Not tomorrow.

708
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,333
Not next week,

709
00:59:06,508 --> 00:59:07,784
but sooner than later.

710
00:59:07,785 --> 00:59:08,785
Just leave!

711
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:17,104
Castigate.

712
00:59:17,105 --> 00:59:19,693
[chuckling softly]

713
00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:22,834
That's another one of my
favorite words.

714
00:59:22,835 --> 00:59:27,010
To castigate it feels
oddly pleasing in my mouth

715
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:31,014
like a piece of watermelon
flavored hard candy

716
00:59:31,015 --> 00:59:32,810
on a warm summer day.

717
00:59:35,054 --> 00:59:37,953
[whistling gently]

718
00:59:54,245 --> 00:59:55,799
Castigate this, asshole.

719
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:04,186
Motherfucker.

720
01:00:04,187 --> 01:00:05,325
Fuck, fuck, fuck shit, shit!

721
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,295
Oh, my god!

722
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:27,036
James.

723
01:00:28,141 --> 01:00:29,729
This guy has been following me.

724
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:33,181
It started at the gym,

725
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,011
and now he's followed me home.

726
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:38,979
He's delusional.

727
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,533
He thinks we've been together.

728
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,916
I'm so scared.

729
01:00:50,232 --> 01:00:51,232
That'll work.

730
01:00:59,828 --> 01:01:02,831
James, baby, I need
to speak to you.

731
01:01:04,488 --> 01:01:06,317
It's really important.

732
01:01:06,524 --> 01:01:08,526
[phone rings]

733
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:22,194
[man chuckling sinisterly]

734
01:01:22,195 --> 01:01:24,232
Infidelity, I like it.

735
01:01:26,096 --> 01:01:29,927
It just rolls off the
tongue, don't you think?

736
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:34,724
[woman screaming]

737
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:38,384
[man chuckling sinisterly]

738
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,790
Getting spun out isn't gonna
make him

739
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:07,308
call you any faster, you know.

740
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:09,103
Just like, kickback.

741
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,104
You're tripping.

742
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,833
I'm not stressing anyone.

743
01:02:17,043 --> 01:02:19,976
If I were hypothetically
waiting for a call,

744
01:02:19,977 --> 01:02:21,496
he would be blowing my phone.

745
01:02:22,877 --> 01:02:24,601
Does your ass get
jealous of all the shit

746
01:02:24,602 --> 01:02:26,500
that comes out of your mouth?

747
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:27,536
So rude.

748
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:32,402
Come on, let's do this.

749
01:02:32,403 --> 01:02:33,403
I'm good.

750
01:02:34,405 --> 01:02:36,027
I didn't ask if you were good.

751
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:37,028
So come on.

752
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:49,248
[Keisha] I don't see why I
have to go.

753
01:03:06,403 --> 01:03:07,955
Alright, beat this car, come on.

754
01:03:07,956 --> 01:03:10,441
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

755
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,480
[Keisha] Damn, girl.

756
01:03:17,241 --> 01:03:20,796
[dramatic music]

757
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,800
[locks disengaging]

758
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,805
Hello.

759
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:37,226
Yo.

760
01:03:38,228 --> 01:03:39,228
This is so hood.

761
01:03:41,507 --> 01:03:42,508
I love it.

762
01:03:43,405 --> 01:03:44,405
Breaking and entry.

763
01:03:45,787 --> 01:03:47,858
What do you know
about the hood, Keisha.

764
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,447
I will let you know
that my minority status

765
01:03:51,448 --> 01:03:55,658
isn't diminished by my
style or education, okay.

766
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:58,937
I'm 100% Afro-centric

767
01:03:58,938 --> 01:04:01,907
with a dash of Latino goodness,
boo, boo.

768
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:04,874
Don't you parents even realize
that they're living proof

769
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,911
that two wrongs
don't make a right?

770
01:04:06,912 --> 01:04:07,912
Whatev'.

771
01:04:15,817 --> 01:04:19,268
So, where is this girl?

772
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:21,408
'Cause I'm hungry and bored.

773
01:04:21,409 --> 01:04:23,617
I don't know stop
riding my bumper, Keisha.

774
01:04:23,618 --> 01:04:25,965
Maybe she's outside playing
Candy Crush.

775
01:04:27,587 --> 01:04:30,244
Or maybe she's
busting out a grumpy.

776
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:31,625
A what?

777
01:04:31,626 --> 01:04:32,833
A grumpy?

778
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:35,802
[grunting heavily]

779
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,598
You know [chuckling],

780
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:40,668
the kind that makes
you strain so much

781
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,568
that the veins in your
neck pop out.

782
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:45,811
[suspenseful music]

783
01:04:45,812 --> 01:04:48,677
[woman screaming]

784
01:04:49,955 --> 01:04:51,025
You asked.

785
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,544
I'm gonna go check the bedrooms.

786
01:04:54,545 --> 01:04:56,789
Okay, you do that.

787
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,929
But, if you ask me,

788
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:02,207
I'd check the bathrooms first.

789
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:04,901
[ominous music]

790
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:17,085
I brought a friend.

791
01:05:45,872 --> 01:05:48,634
[dramatic music]

792
01:05:52,672 --> 01:05:53,984
What the fuck?

793
01:06:06,203 --> 01:06:07,203
Sam.

794
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:10,551
[Sam] What?

795
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:12,865
[Keisha] Did you find her?

796
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:13,865
[Sam] Yeah.

797
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:18,076
Great, so we can get
the fuck out of here.

798
01:06:18,077 --> 01:06:19,941
[Sam] Come over here
first then we can leave.

799
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:27,879
[suspenseful chord striking]
Don't stop.

800
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,054
She was in the bedroom all
this time.

801
01:06:30,055 --> 01:06:31,849
[Keisha] So, she wasn't
taking a shit.

802
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,891
She wants to meet you.

803
01:06:39,892 --> 01:06:42,929
[suspenseful music]

804
01:06:43,758 --> 01:06:46,657
[Keisha screaming]

805
01:06:51,455 --> 01:06:54,286
[dramatic music]

806
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:57,012
[creature growling]

807
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,048
It's what you wanted.

808
01:06:59,498 --> 01:07:02,224
Now let her go.

809
01:07:02,225 --> 01:07:03,467
Release my sister.

810
01:07:06,091 --> 01:07:08,783
[gentle music]

811
01:07:10,888 --> 01:07:11,888
Jessica.

812
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:20,897
[suspenseful music]

813
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:22,968
No.

814
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:25,006
Jessica, don't leave me.

815
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:28,112
Please stay.

816
01:07:28,113 --> 01:07:31,080
No, goddammit you promised!

817
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:32,013
No!

818
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:35,050
[groaning heavily]

819
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,294
You promised!

820
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:48,304
Wait where are we going?

821
01:07:48,305 --> 01:07:50,893
I thought we were
getting something to eat?

822
01:07:50,894 --> 01:07:53,585
I have to pick up something
from a friend first.

823
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:55,104
You wanna come along?

824
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:56,520
I promised it'll be quick.

825
01:07:57,763 --> 01:08:00,593
I guess, at least I can
put my lipstick on inside.

826
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:07,221
[thunder rumbling]

827
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:14,710
[woman screaming]

828
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:17,748
[suspenseful music]

829
01:08:19,302 --> 01:08:21,372
[creature screeching loudly]

830
01:08:21,373 --> 01:08:24,238
[dramatic music]

831
01:08:27,172 --> 01:08:29,760
[gentle music]

832
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,656
[dramatic music]

833
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:17,177
[keyboard clicking]

834
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:20,216
[suspenseful music]

835
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:09,575
[Alien] The world is asleep,

836
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:15,512
dreaming peaceful, safe.

837
01:11:18,135 --> 01:11:19,827
These are the hours I love

838
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,730
when all that I hate is
silent and unconscious.

839
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:31,216
[gentle music]

840
01:11:31,217 --> 01:11:32,598
The world is different

841
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:37,707
when people are asleep, better.

842
01:11:39,674 --> 01:11:42,021
I wish they would sleep forever.

843
01:11:44,645 --> 01:11:46,578
But they always wake up

844
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,618
and ruin everything.

845
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:55,724
[knife pounding
on cutting board]

846
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:59,107
[gentle dramatic music]

847
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:42,132
[dramatic choral singing]

848
01:14:46,102 --> 01:14:49,105
[suspenseful music]

849
01:16:06,872 --> 01:16:09,495
[gentle music]
