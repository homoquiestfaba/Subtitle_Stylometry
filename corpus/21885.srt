Math? What kind of math?

134
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,880
Number theory. Research mostly.

135
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,360
No way.
I work with numbers myself.

136
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,520
I mean, not traditional.
I work with the Torah. Amazing!

137
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,480
Hebrew is all math.
It's all numbers.

138
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,200
You know that? Look.

139
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Ancient Jews used Hebrew
as their numerical system.

140
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,640
Each letter's a number.

141
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,400
The Hebrew A, Aleph, is 1.
B, Bet, is 2.

142
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,200
Understand? But look,
the numbers are interrelated.

143
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
Take the Hebrew word
for father, ab.

144
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,720
Aleph, Bet.

145
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,240
1, 2 equals 3.

146
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,440
The word for mother, haim.

147
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,280
Aleph, Mem.

148
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,360
1, 40 equals 41.
The sum of 3 and 41, 44.

149
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,200
Right? Now, the Hebrew word for
child - mother, father, child.

150
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,440
Yelev.

151
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,480
That's 10, 30 and 4.

152
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,240
44.

153
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,400
Torah is just
a long string of numbers.

154
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,720
Some say that it's a code,
sent to us from God.

155
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,240
That's kind of interesting.

156
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,720
That's kid's stuff,
check this out.

157
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,280
The Garden of Eden, Kadem.

158
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,520
Numerical translation, 144.

159
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,720
The value of tree of knowledge,
in the garden. Right?

160
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,160
Aat ha haim. 2, 33. 1,44. 2,33.

161
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,040
- You can take those numbers...
- Those are Fibonacci numbers.

162
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,040
They're...?

163
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,960
You know,
like the Fibonacci sequence?

164
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,400
Fibonacci?

165
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:47,240
Fibonacci is an Italian
mathematician in the 13th.

166
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,880
If you divide 144 into 233,

167
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,760
- the result approaches Theta.
- Theta?

168
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,920
Theta. The Greek symbol for the
golden ratio, the golden spiral.

169
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,160
Wow.

170
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,520
I never saw that before.

171
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,480
That's like that series
you find in nature?

172
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,120
- Like the face of a sunflower?
- Wherever there are spirals.

173
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,680

First, I get
these crazy low picks,

214
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,720
then it spit out
this string of numbers.

215
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,120
I never saw anything like it.
And then it fries.

216
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,800
- It crashed.
- You have a print out?

217
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,320
- Of what?
- Of the picks, the number?

218
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,680
- I threw it out.
- What number did it spit out?

219
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,960
I don't know,
a string of digits.

220
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,560
- How many?
- I don't know.

221
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,880
What is it, 100, 1,000, 216?
How many?

222
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,040
Probably around 200. Why?

223
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,480
I dealt with some bugs
back in my Pi days.

224
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,360
I wondered
if it was like one I ran into.

225
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,600
Have you met Archimedes?

226
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,760
The one with black spots. See?

227
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,920
You remember
Archimedes of Syracuse? Eh?

228
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,880
The king asks Archimedes
to determine if a present

229
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,080
he has received
is actually solid gold.

230
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,160
Unsolved problem at the time.

231
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,560
It tortures the great Greek
mathematician for weeks.

232
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,520
Insomnia haunts him and he
twists and turns in his bed

233
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,800
for nights on end. Finally,
his equally exhausted wife,

234
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,680
forced to share a bed
with this genius,

235
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,640
convinces him
to take a bath, to relax.

236
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,640
While he's entering the tub,
he notices the bath water rise.

237
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,000
Displacement -
a way to determine volume,

238
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,320
and thus a way
to determine density.

239
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Weight over volume. And thus
Archimedes solves the problem.

240
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,600
He screams "Eureka!"
and he is so overwhelmed,

241
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,000
he runs naked through the
streets to the king's palace

242
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,360
to report his discovery.

243
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,880
Now, what is the moral
of the story?

244
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
That a breakthrough will come.

245
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,400
Wrong! The point of the story
is the wife.

246
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,920
Listen to your wife,
she'll give you perspective.

247
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,960
Meaning, you need a break.

248
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,160
You must take a bath
or you'll get nowhere.

249
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,600
There will be no order,
only chaos.

250
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,920
Go home, Max,
and you take a bath.

251
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,200
Excuse me.
Can I take a look at the paper?

252
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,240
Oh, my God.

253
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
Six and a half.

254
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,880
 Hey...

255
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,600
Hey!

256
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,960
The paper, please.

257
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,360
Mr. Cohen? Perfect timing.
I was going to head home.

258
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,560
- Who are you?
- Marcy Dawson. We were meeting.

259
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,560
It's really not...

260
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,520
It's such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

261
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,240
- I studied your paper...
- Excuse me.

262
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,440
- Let's take my car.
- I can't.

263
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,400
Mr. Cohen...

264
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,480
Yes!

265
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,520
I just threw out something.
I didn't realize I needed it.

266
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,320
Just a print-out.
I lost my data.

267
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,880
Whoa! I'm sorry. Max.
How're you doing? Lenny Meyer.

268
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,240
- Where you going?
- Up there.

269
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,200
You got five minutes?
Do you wanna try Tefillin?

270
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,720
- Not now.
- I've a car to go to the Shul.

271
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,440
- You got a car?
- That's my friend, Ephraim.

272
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,280
- Let's go.
- Great.

273
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,840
When you said you're Max Cohen,

274
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,480
I didn't realize
you were the Max Cohen.

275
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,760
Your work's revolutionary.
It's inspired the work we do.

276
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,720
- It has?
- Very much so.

277
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,200
The only difference is, we're
not looking at the stock market.

278
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,200
Go ahead.
Wrap that round your hand.

279
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,880
We're searching for a pattern
in the Torah.

280
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,240
- What kind?
- We're not sure.

281
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,800
All we know is
it's 216 digits long.

282
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,840
- OK, stand up, please, Max.
- 216?

283
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,680
That's right. You've gotta
be quiet now. Stand up.

284
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,680
- 216?
- Shh. This goes on your head.

285
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,320
Look at me, Max. Right here.

286
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,160
There you go.

287
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,680
All right. Now, we'll say
a prayer together.

288
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,960
Repeat after me: Shma Yisroel.

289
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,840
- Shma Yisroel.
- Right.

290
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,640
- Adenoi Eloihenu.
- Adenoi Eloihenu.

291
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,400
- Adenoi Echod.
- Adenoi Echod.

292
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Now, what's up, Max?

293
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,960
What is this 216 number, Sol?

294
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,920
Excuse me?

295
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,040
You asked me if I'd seen
a 216-digit number.

296
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,120
Oh, yeah. You mean the bug.

297
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,080
I ran into it working on Pi.

298
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,640
- What do you mean ran into it?
- Max, what's this about?

299
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,480
There are these religious Jews
I've been talking to.

300
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,360
Religious Jews?

301
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,440
Yeah, Hasids,
the guys with beards.

302
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,440
I know them.

303
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,320
I know one in a coffee shop.
He's a number theorist.

304
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,560
The Torah is his data set.

305
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,040
He says they're after
a 216-digit number in the Torah.

306
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,520
Come on, it's just coincidence.

307
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
There's something else, though.

308
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,680
What?

309
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
You remember those weird
stock picks?

310
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,800
- Yesterday's stock picks? Yes.
- They were correct.

311
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,760
I got two picks on the nose.
Smack on the nose, Sol.

312
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,560
Something's going on.

313
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,080
It has to do with that number.
There's an answer in it.

314
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,920
Max... Come with me.

315
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,600
The ancient Japanese
considered the Go board

316
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,360
to be a microcosm
of the universe.

317
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,400
Although, when it's empty,
it appears simple and ordered,

318
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,480
the possibilities of gameplay
are endless.

319
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,120
No two Go games are alike,
just like snowflakes.

320
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,960
So, the Go board
actually represents

321
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,600
an extremely complex
and chaotic universe.

322
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,320
And that's the truth
of our world, Max.

323
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,360
It can't be
easily summed up with math.

324
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,440
There is no simple pattern.

325
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,760
But as the game progresses, the
possibilities become smaller.

326
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,880
The board takes on order.
Soon, every move's predictable.

327
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,920
So?

328
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,640
So maybe, even though
we're not aware of it,

329
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,400
there is a pattern, an order
underlying every Go game.

330
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,640
Maybe it's like the pattern
in the stock market?

331
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,480
The Torah? This 216 number?

332
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,200
- It's insanity.
- Maybe it's genius.

333
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,960
- I must get that number.
- Hold on! You're losing it.

334
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,200
You have to breathe.
Listen to yourself.

335
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,520
You're connecting my computer
bug with one you might've had

336
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,760
and some religious hogwash.

337
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,880
If you want the number 216,
you can find it everywhere.

338
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,040
216 steps from your street
corner to your front door,

339
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,880
216 seconds
you spend in the elevator

340
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,200
When your mind becomes obsessed

341
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,360
you filter everything else out
and find that thing everywhere.

342
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,880
320, 450, 22, whatever.

343
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,120
You've chosen 216 and you'll
find it everywhere in nature.

344
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,560
But, Max,

345
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,480
as soon as you discard
scientific rigor,

346
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,480
you are no longer
a mathematician,

347
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,680
you're a numerologist.

348
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,920
Mr. Cohen?

349
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,960
Mr. Cohen...

350
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,880
God damn it! I'm sick
of you following me.

351
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,640
I'm not interested in money.
I want to understand our world.

352
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,800
I don't deal with materialists
like you.

353
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,040
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

354
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,440
I admit
we've been too aggressive.

355
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,320
But all I ask is that
you give me five minutes.

356
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,280
- As a token, accept this.
- I don't want your money.

357
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,080
The suitcase isn't filled
with 50s, or gold, or diamonds.

358
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,600
Just silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.

359
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,080
Ming Mecca? They're not even
de-classified yet.

360
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,400
You're right, they're not. But
Lancet-Percy has many friends.

361
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,840
Beautiful, isn't it?

362
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,280
Do you know how rare these are?

363
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,920
What do you...?

364
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Mr. Cohen?

365
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,440
- Are you OK?
- No.

366
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,880
Mr. Coh... Sir, are you sick?

367
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,960
Hey!

368
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,080
C'mon, buddy. Get up.

369
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,040
It's Coney Island, last stop.

370
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,360
Here. For your nose.

371
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,840
Jenna, come back! Jenna!

372
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,880
Jenna, come back here.

373
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,280
- Farrouhk?
- No, it's Max, from next door.

374
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,480
Max. Is everything all right?

375
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,600
- Do you have any iodine?
- Did you cut yourself?

376
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,840
No, it's to stain a slide.

377
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,880
Ah. Science.
The pursuit of knowledge.

378
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,160
One second.

379
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,160
You surprised me.
I thought you were Farrouhk.

380
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,760
Here we are.

381
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,120
What are you examining?
A potato?

382
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,040
No. Just something
for my computer. Thanks.

383
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,280
- Shalom.
- Lenny, it's Max Cohen.

384
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,720
Max. What're you doing now?

385
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,760

our conversation last night.

386
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,600

OK, sit down.

480
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,840
I gave up before I pinpointed
it, but my guess is that, er,

481
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,760
certain problems cause computers
to get stuck in a loop.

482
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:03,040
The loop leads to meltdown,
but just before they crash

483
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:08,480
they become aware
of their own structure.

484
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,320
The computer has a sense
of its own silicon nature

485
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,720
and it prints out
its ingredients.

486
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,600
The computer becomes conscious?

487
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,600
In... In, er...some ways...
I guess.

488
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,080
Studying the pattern
made Euclid conscious of itself.

489
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,520
It died spitting out the number.
Consciousness is the number?

490
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,600
No, Max. It's only a nasty bug.

491
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,040
- It's more than that.
- No. It's a dead end!

492
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,000
- There's nothing there!
- It's a door, Sol. A door.

493
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,240
A door to a cliff, you're
driving yourself over the edge.

494
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,320
- You need to stop.
- You were afraid.

495
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,920
- That's why you quit.
- I got burnt.

496
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,120
- Come on.
- It caused my stroke!

497
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,600
That's bullshit! It's
mathematics, numbers, ideas.

498
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,400
Mathematicians
should go to the edge.

499
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,120

- It's death!

500
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,960
You can't tell me what it is.

You've retreated to your Go
and books and goldfish.

502
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,040
Max, go home.

503
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,000
- You're not satisfied.
- Go home. Get out...

504
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,280
I'm gonna see it!

505
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,040

- I'm gonna understand it.

00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,560

- Me.

510
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,880
- Who sent you?
- I'm a student.

511
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,840
- Gimme that.
- I've an assignment for class.

512
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,560
Leave me alone.

513
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,800
- Marcy. What's the matter?
- Let's go for a ride, Max.

514
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,640
I can't. I have work.

515
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,920
We had a deal, Max.
Now, let's get in the car.

516
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,880
- Don't ever touch me!
- Max! Max!

517
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,280
- Help!
- Max.

518
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,800
- Leave me alone!
- Max, come here.

519
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,680
Max. Where're you going, Max?
Stop, Max!

520
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,400
- Max! God damn it!
- Help! Help!

521
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,880
Help!

522
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,600
- Get him!
- I got him.

523
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,000
Come here, Max.

524
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,520
Get outta here.

525
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,600
- Where'd he go?
- He's over there.

526
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,560
Max.

527
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,320
Leave me alone!

528
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,360
- I got him.
- Get off of me!

529
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,200
- Help me! Help!
- Get over here!

530
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,520
- Sit down and shut the hell up.
- Calm down.

531
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,440
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with matches?

532
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,200
The market's going to crash.

533
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,920
I didn't do anything.
I don't play the market.

534
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,000
Be careful where you throw out
your trash.

535
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,520
How could you do that?

536
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:09,160
You gave faulty information.
You dangled the carrot,

537
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,880
but only gave us
part of the code.

538
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,280
Now give us the rest
to set it right.

539
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,840
You bastards!
How could you be so stupid?

540
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,400
Max, you just don't get it.

541
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:25,560
I don't give a shit about you,
just what's in your head!

542
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,320
If you won't help us, we'll
comply with the laws of nature.

543
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,760
Survival of the fittest -
and we've got the fucking gun!

544
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,280
- Max! Come here!
- Lenny? Lenny!

545
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,240
- Hey!
- C'mon, get in here. Hurry!

546
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,240
Stay down! Stay down.

547
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,240
We've been looking for you.

548
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,120
- What's going on?
- You have the number?

549
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,240
What's going on? What is it?

550
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,440
What're you doing?
Get off of me!

551
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,920
Where's the number?

552
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,680
It's not on me. It's in my head.

553
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,880
You memorized it?
Did you give it to them?

554
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,080
- Who?
- Those Wall Street bastards.

555
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,440
- What do you care?
- Answer me.

556
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,160
Listen. This is really big.

557
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,400
I don't wanna hurt you.
Did you give it to them?

558
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,960
They've got part of it. Let go!

559
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,400
Damn it!

560
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,400
- They're using it.
- Using what?

561
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,520
Shut up! Impetuous little runt!

562
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,600
- Let go!
- No, don't!

563
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,760
Max.

564
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,400
Max.

565
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,080
Max.

566
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,960
Max.

567
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,520
You're all right.

568
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,200
I'm Rabbi Cohen.
Cohen, like you.

569
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,800
I'm sorry for what Lenny did.
He's been reprimanded.

570
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,720
It's not our way. Are you OK?

571
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,800
Yeah.

572
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,760
Max, you have
to give us the number.

573
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,040
What is it?

574
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,880
The Talmud tells us
it began 2,000 years ago,

575
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,080
when the Romans destroyed
the second temple.

576
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,640
What is this?

577
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,760
Max, you'll understand
if you listen.

578
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,200
The Romans also destroyed
our priesthood, the Cohanim.

579
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:12,440
And with their deaths, they
destroyed our greatest secret.

580
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,280
In the center of the temple
was the heart of Jewish life,

581
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,240
the holy of holies.

582
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,520
It was the earthly residence
of our God.

583
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,960
The one God.

584
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,280
It housed the Ark
of the Tabernacle,

585
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,040
which stored the original 10
Commandments

586
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,640
which God gave to Moses.

587
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,920
Only one man was allowed
to enter this holy of holies

588
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,160
on one day, the holiest day
of the year, Yom Kippur.

589
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,960
On the Day of Atonement,

590
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,040
all of Israel
would descend upon Jerusalem

591
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,000
to watch the High Priest,
the Cohen Godul,

592
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,880
make his trip
to the holy of holies.

593
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
If the High Priest was pure,
he would emerge moments later

594
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,080
and we'd have a prosperous year.

595
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,400
It meant we were one year closer
to the Messianic age.

596
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:11,640
But, if he was impure,
he would die instantly

597
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,560
and it meant we were doomed.

598
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,880
The High Priest
had one ritual to perform there.

599
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,720
He had to intone a single word.

600
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,120
Yeah?

601
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,160
That word was
the true name of God.

602
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,560
So?

603
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,400
The true name,
which only the Cohanim knew,

604
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,440
was 216 letters long.

605
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,200
Are you telling me that...

606
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,840
That the number in my head
is the true name of God.

607
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,160
Yes! It's the key
to the Messianic age.

608
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,000
It will take us closer
to the Garden of Eden.

609
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,840
As the temple burnt,
the Talmud tells us

610
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,360
the High Priest
walked into the flames.

611
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,200
He took the key to the top
of the building,

612
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:09,240
the heavens opened
and received the key

613
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,280
from the priest's
outstretched hand.

614
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,400
We have been looking
for that key ever since.

615
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,200
And you may have found it.

616
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,040
That's what happened.

617
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,280
I saw God.

618
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:34,600
No. You are not pure. You cannot
see God unless you are pure.

619
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,960
No... I saw everything.

620
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,080
You saw nothing, only a glimpse.
There's so much more.

621
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,080
We can unlock the door
and show God we're pure again.

622
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,080
You're not pure.
How are you pure? I found it!

623
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:58,920
Who do you think you are?
You are only a vessel from God.

624
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,640
You're carrying a delivery
meant for us!

625
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,200
It was given to me.

626
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,880
It's inside of me.
It's changing me.

627
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,680
It's killing you! Because you
are not ready to receive it.

628
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,720
It's just a number.

629
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,320
I'm sure you've written down
every 216-digit number.

630
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,400
You've translated all of them.

631
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,960
You've intoned them all.
Haven't you?

632
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,800
What's it gotten you?

633
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,640
The number is nothing.

634
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,400
It's the meaning.

635
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,440
The syntax.
It's what's between the numbers.

636
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,800
You haven't understood it.

637
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,640
It's because it's not for you.

638
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,600
I've got it. I've got it!

639
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:08,560
I understand it. And I'm gonna
see it. Rabbi, I was chosen.
