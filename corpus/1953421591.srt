1
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,000
As the story begins, our heroes have vowed to rid the lands of their mortal enemy, The Shadow, and his evil minions.

2
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,900
Their endless quest continues...

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
...during finals week.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THE GAMERS

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I got a test in the morning...

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
... hit the tendon.
You gotta hit the tendon

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Could you freaks keep it down?

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Uh, yeah, sure.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have a huge test in the morning and a book to finish...

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,500
... and I can't concentrate wich you guys jerking off all night. Knock it off.

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Come on. Let's go guys.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That was such a good movie.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's easily the best anime thing I've ever seen in my life.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He had to have, like, a dex of 20 or something.

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's true, that's true.
I completely agree.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You know what I'd like to see?
What?
A fight between that guy and the dark elf with the scimitars.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
OOOHH! Totally, totally.
That'd be awesome.

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, where's Mark?

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Uh, oh, uh, he had uh, he's going to be late...

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
... he had a paper or something.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No. Actually, I think he's going out with Molly tonight.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What? Oh man!

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Dude, what's up with that?
People with girlfriends, man.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Everyone have their character sheets?
Right here, definitely.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Everyone got their dice?

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I get your dice right here.
Sweet.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yout're going to be needing
those tonight, ya know?

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh yeah, that means battles guys!
Big battles. Oh yeah.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Uh huh. I might finally get to use that sword of ogre decapitation.

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Djahhh, that'd be awesome.
I'dlove it.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We're starting here...

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
...everyone remember where we left off?
Oh yeah.

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It was at the battle of Black Fields
Where Rogar's blood brother was killed.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
NOOOooo!!

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, guys, that was last week.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, I remember. We were at the town of Westhaven...

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
... um. Nimble's sister got murdered outside the temple.

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why?! WHY?!?!

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Dude, we're way past there.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Huh?
We are?

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, I don't remember that.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You ended up outside Dragonmead.
Don't you remember?

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The inn? The note pinned to the door.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, the note!
Remember that?

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
With the dagger in the door and the
note hanging down. I wrote that down.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I said that the first time.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, let's just read that
again to recap that, shall we?

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
From the hand of his Majesty,
Orlando the reasonably just,

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,500
on the eve of Haversford
in the Year of III Fortune.

50
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,000
I fear for the life of the princess, my only daughter and heiress to my kingdom.

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,000
She was kidnapped from the royal gardens and
taken south by the biack priests in service of...

52
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
"The Shadow"

53
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,500
The Shadow?!!

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
The Shadow?!!!

55
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,000
The Shadow.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He has threatened to throw her into
the pit of slow and horribly painful death.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
unless I surrender the throne.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You are the princess's only hope.
You brave adventurers...

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
...Rogar the Barbarian, warrior prince of the Icewalker tribe...

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
...Newmoon, elven archer and ambassador to the realms of man...

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
...Nimble, master agent of the Thieves Guild,
only recently paroled by royal decree...

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
...and Ambrose, journeyman, mage
of the West Haven Wizards' School.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Dude, don't forget Mark!

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
What? Oh right...

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Mark the Red. Last of the Blood-Fire Berserkers.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Only you can save the princess,
succeed ahd you may name your reward.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A noble quest, let us free the wench and slay her captor

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Mane our reward, access to
the kingdom treasury of course.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We should speak with the
folk in the commons first.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They may know what
awaits us to the South.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I agree with the mage.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,500
To the commons.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Alright. The common room is
full of travelers and a few town folk.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You find a table near the fireplace.
What do you do?

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Rogar orders the
strongest drink they have.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,500
The barmaid warns you.
'Dwarven ale is not for the weak of stomach'.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,500
Yeah, you might want
to pass on that.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Relax, Rogars stamina is 18, there's
only a 10% chance he'll be affected.

79
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,000
Then you're really
going to risk it?

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ok. Roll your stamina.

82
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,300
you fail.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The barmaid warned him.

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It would seem that our barbarian
friend cannot handle his ale.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ha! It is too early for ale. but the
time is always right for some wine.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll be back with four,
make that three, glasses.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But you haven't any money.
However shall you pay?

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Leave that up to me.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There's only one patron at the bar,
and he doesn't notice you.

90
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
I pick his pocket.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Roll it.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Ha ha. Got it.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Does he have any, uh, weapons or anything?

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, he's got a knife.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I take that too.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Ok. Roll it.

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ha Ha, Cool. I'm kien(k)?ing ass!

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I want to steal his pants.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're not serious.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I am serious.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why do you want his pants?

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't want them. I just want to see if I can steal them.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Fine go ahead, but you suffer
a -8 penalty for difficulty.

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
I don't believe it.

105
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,400
Are you quite finished?

106
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Yeah. Oh, and I order some
wine from the innkeeper.

107
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Dude, I can't belive
you took his pants!

108
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
I know: Lucky roll.

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,000
Dude, am I still unconscious?

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Alright. I took around the common
room. do I recognize anyone?

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's find out.

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He's about 7 feet tall and
he's built like a lighthouse.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Not good
Oh Shit.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He's got a nasty scar on his cheek,
and an ugly club in his hand.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's Hunk, the mercenary you guys left for
dead outside the Castle of Almost Certain Doom.

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He recognizes you instantly, snarls
and lumbers over to your table.

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yout bastards!
Tought I was dead, did not you?

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Vell. I'm not, but soon yur(you)? going to be,
because I'm going to kill you dead, d'yah hear me?

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
D-E-D, Dead!

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, shit! What do we do?

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Am I still unconscious?

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh yeah.

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Did Hunk see Nimble at the bar?

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What?

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Nimble was at the bar when Hunk
showed up. Did he see him at the bar?

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's check.

128
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,000
Nope.

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Ah, Booyah, I sneak into backstab position.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're going to attack him?
What good is that going to do?

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Duh! I do triple damage when
I attack from behind!

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I sneak into place behind Hunk
and unsheathe my dagger.

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Just your dagger?

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hm, Good point.
I'll use my sword.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Even with triple damage, it's
not going to kill a guy Hunk's size.

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Wait, I have a better idea!

137
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're going to backstab
him with a ballista?

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Uh huh.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
With a fucking siege weapon?

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Uh huh.

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Ok. There's got to be
a rule against this.

142
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
There probably is
a rule though.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I can totally picture this guys.
you know wheeling it in.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and then cranking it up.
Oh...dude! It's too much.

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, there's nothing
against it in the rules.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't belive I'm doing this...

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, that's 264
points of damage.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You splatter Hunk all
over the common room.

150
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The patrons shriek in horror
and run out of the inn.

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
occasionally slipping on
blood and entrails.

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're now alone in a room that looks like
a vat of beef stroganoff exploded in it.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Cool.

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You leave the inn and town and
you head south for most of the day...

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
...and you spend the
night in a forest clearing.

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Ok, who wants first watch?

157
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Am I awake now?

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're a little hung over,
but you're awake.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Ok, I take first watch.

160
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do I see anything
strange that night?

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
As a matter of fact, you do.

162
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
I ready my sword.

163
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,000
I draw my dagger.

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're still asleep.

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh yeah.

166
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Who are you? Speak or I will (shall)
smite thee with my mighty blade(s).

167
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Smite thee with
my mighty blade?

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Shut up!

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Help me, please save me.

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I am imprisoned
in the south.

171
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
She wishes us to free her.

172
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Dude, you're still asleep.

173
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Me too?

174
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

175
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Free you? Where are you mysterious lady?
Who holds you prisoner?

176
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The Shadow.

177
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The Shadow?
The Shadow?

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The Shadow.

179
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Fear not, noble lady.

180
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We shall free you.

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
By morning you will again
sup the sweet air of freedom.

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
Sup the sweet air of freedom?

183
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Shut up!

184
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,000
You guys are all asleep!

185
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Not you Rogar.

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh... sorry.

187
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
To the south,
come to the south...

188
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Past the river through the
ruins of the ancient castle...

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Free me. Please.
To the south.

190
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,000
You journey southwarn(?)
for several days.

191
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,000
You brave dark forests,
cross vast plains.

192
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,500
you climb steep cliffs and
wind through mountain trails.

193
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Day after day, the four
of you push farther south.

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Uh, the five of us.

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Right.

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
After a week's journey you come
to a river that blocks your path.

197
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Dude.
What.

198
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Aren't you forgetting something?

199
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Like what?

200
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Like your character's paralyzing
fear of water, perhaps?

201
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

202
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There's no bridge or boat,
but it is shallow enough to wade across.

203
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm not going near any water.

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, we'll have to knock him out.

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What?

206
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I punch in the head.

207
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Roll em.

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,500
Ambrose takes 2 damage,
but he's not out.

209
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Here, let me try.
I'm a better fighter.

210
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's see, where's my good die.
Uh, here it is. Come on 20.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Am I unconscious yet?

212
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No but you took
another 4 damage.

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Here let me.
Here's my good die.

214
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Roll well

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Alright. I'll show you guys how to do this.

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Carefull!

217
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well. Ambrose is very unconseious.
That's 19 damage.

218
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
19?

219
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm dead!
You killed me!

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oops. Does anyone
have healing magic?

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He did.

222
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sorry?

223
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Way to fucking
kill me, dude!

224
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, just roll up another character.
He can jump in later.

225
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
19 damage.

226
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
After you cross the river...

227
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Wait, wait! Cross the river.
Shouldn't we, like, bury him?

228
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You know, like give
him a proper funeral?

229
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I agree.

230
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Thanks guys!

231
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, dude, we get, like,
15 piety points per level

232
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
when we bury a party member,
and since he was level 6...

233
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That'd be like 90 points!

234
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Boo yah!

235
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And that'll totally make up
for that orphanage we burned down.

236
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Alas, poor Ambrose,
we hardly knew thee.

237
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Dibs on the knife.
I get the bag.

238
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The staff is mine.

239
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
After burying Ambrose, you
make it safely across the river.

240
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You continue your voyage
south along the forest trail.

241
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Everything goes smoothly until...

242
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Uh, wait a minute
An ambush?

243
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm an elf. I shouldn't
have missed the ambush.

244
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So, you were taken
by surprise.

245
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Why didn't I get
a surprise roll?

246
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I rolled for you.
You failed.

247
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Still I have the detect ambush
skill. Dude, I wanna roll.

248
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Dude, you were surprised!

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No, with detect ambush I get an
automatic roll, even in a surprise situation!

250
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes, but to get that check you have
to say that you're looking for an ambush!

251
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I always expect an ambush!

252
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't always expect an ambush.
How do you ever sleep?

253
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, that's beside the point...

254
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I would naturally expect an
ambush in an unfamiliar forest.

255
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Dude, I want my check.

256
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No, you weren't expecting the
ambush when you entred the forest.

257
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
therefore, I rule that you
were taken by surprise.

258
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,000
May I continue now?

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah.
Unbelivable

260
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
19 fricking points.

261
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Maek way for
the Bandit King!

262
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
All hail the Bandit King!

263
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,500
Hail! Hail! Hail!

264
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Good day gentlemen.
I am the Bandit King.

265
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,000
This road...

266
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Would you let me
finish his speech first?

267
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Why should I? He's going
to try to kill us.

268
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You don't know that.
Besides, you're still surprised.

269
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Surprise doesn't wear off for 3
rounds and you don't get to attack.

270
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Whatever.

271
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,000
Hey, isn't Mark
supposed to be here?

272
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Uh yeah...

273
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
... he's over there.

274
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This road belongs to me
and there's a toll.

275
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
See, the Bandit King is
in the employ of...

276
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
...The Shadow.

277
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
The Shadow?
The Shadow?

278
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
The Shadow.

279
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Should you choose to pass peacefully, the
toll is merely all your woridly possessions.

280
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You are seriously pissing me off.

281
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What? Three roads is 15 seconds.
I counted them off.

282
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
After 3 rounds, I'm no longer
surprised, so I get the attack.

283
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,500
Yeah right. Ok, well, you
can't attack until I say so.

284
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Dude, it's in the rules.
Here, 15 seconds, uh...

285
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
No, We spent most
of that arguing.

286
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,000
You can't attack
until I say so.

287
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Now stop killing him
and let him finish talking.

288
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
It's in the rules.

289
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Should you choose to pass peacefully the toll,
is merely all your worldly possessions.

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Should you choose to fight?
The toll is you lives.

291
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's your choice, but I warn
you  not to underestimate...

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's it!

293
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, the bandits
have a +4 morale.

294
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They also have a +2 terrain
bonus from the forest,

295
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and the ambush.

296
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, set your to-hit
rolls at a +6.

297
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Do I get the bonus from
the Sword of Ogre Decapitation?

298
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No, actually, that
only works on Ogres.

299
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's why it's called the
Sword of Ogre Decapitation.

300
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Nice try.

301
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Now begins the killing
followed by a light salad.

302
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Charge!

303
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
You're fired!

304
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Alright, so whose initiative is it?
I think it's mine.

305
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Hey guys, am I to late to join?
Mark!

306
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Dude, I'm so glad
you're here.

307
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Thank goodness. We're
getting out asses kicked.

308
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
We're in a battle?
Hell yeah!

309
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Am I there?
Yeah.

310
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Where am I?
Right here.

311
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Can I go into
a Berserker Rage?

312
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I go into a
Berserker Rage!

313
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Blood, Death,
and Vengance!

314
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Beautifelly cut, sir Mark

315
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
My blades were
thirsty today.

316
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Is the Bandit King
amonh the dead?

317
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
No, in fact he's running
away down the path.

318
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Stop him!

319
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh. How far
away is he?

320
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
About 100 yards.

321
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That's extreme range
even for an elf.

322
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Um, how much
cover does he have?

323
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The forest is a little thicker
around here. It's about 9/10ths.

324
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Don't forget the
-2 wound penalty.

325
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What's your to-hit?

326
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I can only hit
on a 20.

327
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I take the shot.

328
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Booyah!

329
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Masterful shot,
friend elf..

330
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He hadn't the
chance to escape.

331
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Three cheers for the archer!
Hup hup! Hazah! Hup hup! Hazah! Hup hup!

332
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Shut Up!

333
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
God damn it! I'm trying to study here!
It's not like I'm asking much!

334
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you guys don't knock if off,
I'm going to call the fucking RD.

335
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
God, how many times do I have to put
up with that? I cannot believe this! It's sick bullshit!

336
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Maybe we should keep it down.

337
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Prob...probably.

338
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And on that note.
I gotta go.

339
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What? but you just got in the deer!
Why the hell do you have to go?

340
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I promised Molly that I'd take
her out to coffee. You know.

341
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'll have to take over your character  you know.
Yeah I know.

342
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Have fun storming the castle.

343
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Can you belive this?
He's missed the last 3 sessions.

344
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We should kill his character.

345
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, yeah, kill him. That'll teach
him to interact with females.

346
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Can you belive he would actually rather go
out with a beautiful, intelligent young woman,

347
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
than hang out in this ass-smelling
basement with his best friends,

348
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
on a Friday night playing adventure
games and having belching contests?

349
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And all for the off
chance he'll score too!

350
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Can you imagine that?

351
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So...we're in
the forest, right?

352
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Uh yeah. the forest.

353
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You follow Brigands Road for a few
hours until the forest swallows the path

354
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and you are again in the wilderness.

355
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You hike for 3 more days...

356
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
...and eventually follow a trail into the
foothills of Connadure. As you exit the hills...

357
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
... the land stopes down before you.

358
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
There on the plain below you, you see
the broken ruins of a once great castle.

359
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
sitting solemnly
in the shadows.

360
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The Princess must
be in that castle.

361
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Onward, our journey
is nearing its end.

362
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You see a young man
standing in the ruins.

363
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
He's dressed in flowing wizards robes
and has an air of mystery around him.

364
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Dude, is this
your new character?

365
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

366
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Guys, please! I want
you to roleplay this.

367
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Remember you've never met this guy before,
the last guys you met tried to kill you.

368
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and you're standing in the
ruins of an evil, cursed castle.

369
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Just act appropriately.

370
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Hello. I'm Magellan, a traveling mage.
I notice your group has no wizard.

371
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,500
You seem trustworthy. Would
you care to join us in our noble quest?

372
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,500
Yes. Yes, I would.

373
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,000
Broken stones and petrified wood
litter the ground outside the castle.

374
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,000
You follow the remains of what
was once a major road to the ruins

375
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
nly to find a set of massive
irom bars blocking the entrance.

376
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Ok. I rip them
out of the way.

377
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What's your strength?

378
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
19. That's a 95%
chance of success.

379
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Roll 'em.

380
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh! Ooo!
I don't believe this

381
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Here why don't 'I have
Newmoon give it a try?

382
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,500
What's your Strength?
six

383
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Ok
Roll it.

384
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Lift with the legs,
Rogar, not the back.

385
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's very dark. Ambrose...

386
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,500
It's Magellan.

387
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,500
Whatever,
is it safe?

388
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We shall see.

389
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Ok. I'll use my staff
of evil detection.

390
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Well, is it safe?

391
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It most assurendly is not.

392
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,500
A dark narrow passage snakes off into the fortress.
There's a sputtering torch every 20 yards or so,

393
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,000
but they aren't giving off enough
light to push the darkness.

394
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Nimble takes point.

395
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The air gets warmer and harder to
breath the farther you go into the ruins.

396
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
After a few turns, you come
to a large door. It's locked.

397
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I pick the lock.

398
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Do I see anything odd in the next hall?
Nope.

399
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I walk down the hall.

400
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,400
Did I say walk down the hall?
I meant sneak down the hall.

401
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,000
So why didn't you
say sneak before?

402
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,200
I shouldn't have to. I'm a thief.
I sneak every where I go.

403
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,700
No you don't. You don't sneak around in
broad daylight, you don't sneak around in church.

404
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,000
No, but I do sneak
around in a danger zone.

405
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,600
Yeah, but you didn't know there was a trap in the room
so you didn't know it was a danger zone. Did you?

406
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,400
Look. A thief of my level wouldn't
walk blindly into a possibly trapped room.

407
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,800
Like you did.

408
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,000
I wouldn't have
if you'd just...

409
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Fine. Fine.
We'll do it again.

410
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Did I say sneak down the hall?
Yes, you did.

411
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Well, as a master thief, of course I
would know when to be weary of such traps.

412
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Uh huh. And what would a
master thief do in such a situation?

413
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:14,000
Easy. I crawl down the hall an
inch at a time lookong for traps.

414
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,000
Whatever.

415
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,500
Damn it. Who's got
the most hit points?

416
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,700
Rogar.
Of course.

417
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,000
Well you do it then.
Ok.

418
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,500
Rogar takes 35
points of damage.

419
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh no! I've got 85 points left!
Ohhh, Ohhh, Oohhhhh! (Crowd applause)

420
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You follow the hall into a vast new room
in the middle of which you see a stone throne.

421
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Seated upon the throne is a figure
who strikes terror into your hearts.

422
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,700
He's dressed in midnight blacks and blues,
and his cloak billows around his form-fitting armor.

423
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,500
His face is masked, but his body
moves with deadly grace and precision.

424
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,000
His name rises from your nightmares.
He is known as...

425
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The Shadow!

426
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The Shadow?

427
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,000
The Shadow.

428
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:58,700
I' ve been waiting, waiting for you
to come to me, and now I have you.

429
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,700
You, who have caused me
so much trouble in the past.

430
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Rogar, Newmoon,
Nimble, Ambrose...

431
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Magellan!

432
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
Magellan, sorry...

433
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,700
and Mark.

434
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,500
You've beaten my bandits, you've bested
my traps, but to rescue the princess,

435
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,000
you must defeat me.

436
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Now come, come and
let us finish this game.

437
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Oh dear...

438
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm going to prepare a spell.
Which one?

439
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,700
Polymorph other.

440
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Dude, that spell takes a ton of time to prepare.
The Shadow's going to waste us before you're done.

441
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,700
Well, then give
me a distraction.

442
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,600
Send Mark after him.

443
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,500
That's good!
Yeah, have Mark attack him

444
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
OK

445
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,500
Dude. Don't forget
his battle cry...

446
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,500
Blood, death,
and vengance.

447
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And now for
the rest of you.

448
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,000
Great, Mark's going
to be pissed.

449
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,300
How's that spell coming?
I need more time.

450
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,000
The Shadow steps towards
you to engage you in combat.

451
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,000
Call shot to the nuts!
What?

452
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Combat rules state that
the crotch is a vital area.

453
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,500
If you hit an opponent in a vital area,
he's stunned for one round.

454
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,000
Call shot to the nuts.

455
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You will pay for
your insolence.

456
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Oh, that hurt!

457
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Alright guys. I've got my spell ready.
Da me he fermentum

458
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What the hell did
you turn him into?

459
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
An ogre.

460
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Why? Those things
are dangerous!

461
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,000
Sword of Ogre
Decapitation.

462
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,500
You've done it!
You've killed the shadow!

463
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
We came, we saw,
we kicked his nuts!

464
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Ahd wait, uh, what
about the Princess?

465
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Is she not int the room?
No.

466
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Maybe there's a
door somewhere?

467
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I look around for a secret door.
Good call.

468
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,000
Well, you see a secret trap door behind the Shadow's
throne. It leads down into another dark corridor.

469
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
We're not done yet, guys.
There might be harder stuff further along.

470
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
What, harder than The Shadow?
I doubt it.

471
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's just keep going.

472
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The new corridor comes to an abrupt end,
blocked by a door that feads farther underground

473
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
A soft light is shining
underneath it.

474
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Can we hear
anything inside?

475
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You hear muffied voices. You make out
at least 2, but there could be more.

476
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Pick the lock, thief.

477
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Shhhh... did you guys
hear something?

478
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,500
No, I didn't. Did you?
No, I guess not.

479
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Nimble, you hear
3 more voices.

480
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,500
There are at
least 5 of them.

481
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We must take this door.
It is the only passage.

482
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
What vile demons lie
beyond this door?

483
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
We'll see in a moment.
Ready yourselves.

484
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Nimble picks the lock while the
rest of you prepare for battle.

485
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Whoever's inside keeps talking.
You don't think you've been heard.

486
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
We're keeping it down, damn it!
Shut the hell up out there!

487
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You hear an angry shout.

488
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We've been heard.

489
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
We've lost the element of surprise.

490
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
They know we're here!

491
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Kill em. Kick the door
in and kill them all!

492
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,200
Where's the princess?

493
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,000
Forget the princess, who
are these strange sorcerers?

494
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Amazing! My entire life
is written here!

495
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
My intelligence is 4!
Outrageous!

496
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Give me that pen!

497
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:53,000
God damn it! I have tried to be nice,
but you guys are so un-fucking-believably noisy!

498
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,500
Some of us have lives
and have to study.

499
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,000
If you don't shut up, I'm going
to call campus-fucking-safety!

500
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
The Princess!
We've found her!

501
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Leave me out of your
sick-ass fantasy, weirdo.

502
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Nice ears, loser.

503
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,700
Fucking gamers.
