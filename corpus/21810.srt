1
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,611
This is Grinnell, Iowa, my hometown,

2
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,197
Where my family and all of my friends live.

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,199
But I'm not there now.

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,535
I'm here.
New York City.

5
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,080
Home to eight million people,
roughly half of whom are men.

6
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:43,210
Which means half of the city is genetically 
predisposed to lie to the other half.

7
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:48,340
You see, I'm the woman who has the world's 
worst judgment in men.

8
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,008
I know what you're thinking.

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:55,305
You might think that you do,
but you don't. I do.

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,267
My grade-school boyfriend,
Tommy, left me for...

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,769
someone with boobs.

12
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,605
My high-school boyfriend,
Charlie, left me for,

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,608
Well, someone who didn 't have any boobs.

14
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,112
Amanda. This isn't what it looks like.

15
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,281
But that's all behind me now.

16
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,243
I have a great job restoring paintings
at the Metropolitan Museum.

17
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,871
I'm in the Renaissance art division,

18
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,998
Where the men are easier to deal with.

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,502
There you are, handsome.

20
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,176
So there's this new hottie upstairs
in 20th-century sculpture.

21
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:36,471
She is so sweet, and I swear I'm gonna be gettin' 
all up in there, and I'm gonna be--

22
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,183
Lisa, you are crossing the sharing boundary again.

23
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,603
But seriously, we have to put in for transfers.

24
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:46,690
Renaissance is a dead end.
We're gonna end up like the menopause triplets there.

25
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,276
What? Hmm?

26
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,320
I don't think I could ever leave Renaissance.

27
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,405
I would miss these paintings way too much.

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,408
I mean, they're just so romantic and--

29
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,369
- Shit. Here comes old man Rankin. Look busy.
- Oh! Rat farts!

30
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,913
I am busy.
Help me look busy.

31
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:06,168
- Afternoon, ladies.
- When will we go to the Poconos again?

32
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,921
Amanda, I need your help.

33
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,633
Take a look at this piece of crap.

34
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,554
Oh, my God, it's--

35
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,306
That's Titian's The Bacchanal.

36
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,059
- Oh!
- There she goes again.

37
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,145
Look at this man's face.
It's completely lost.

38
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,856
You're gonna have to start from scratch on that.

39
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,401
Put aside your other work, Amanda. 
This is priority number one for now.

40
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,612
Oop!

41
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,740
What's with you and this weak-in-the-knees routine?

42
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,493
You do it every time you get a new painting.

43
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,871
I do not.
Not every time.

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,873
I mean, when I look at this painting,

45
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,084
I can just tell that these people were in love...

46
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,671
and they stayed in love until the day that they died.

47
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,049
Amanda, it's a painting.
If this were real life, in two years,

48
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,344
that girl would be pregnant and that guy 
would be out banging a barmaid.

49
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,764
Maybe that's why I like art better than real life.

50
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,016
They can stay in love forever.

51
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,228
Speaking of real life, aren't you supposed 
to have one tonight, for a change?

52
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,524
Oh, sh--
That's right.

53
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,485
I was gonna surprise
Michael with dinner.

54
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,113
What's so funny?

55
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,199
Nothing. Just that you're going to die alone.

56
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,995
- What?
- She's going to die alone!

57
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,414
Ohh.

58
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,293
Seriously, why do I need a personal life
if my work makes me happy?

59
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,380
Because work isn't enough.
You need someone to share your life with.

60
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,674
And if you give up on that now,

61
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,594
it might not be so easy to find later.

62
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,263
Polly, could I see you in my office?

63
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:45,851
I need to have a look at the, uh, restoration reports.

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,233
Oh, God. Do you think that could be me one day?

65
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,277
No. If it got that bad, I'd shoot you...

66
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,821
and put you out of your misery.

67
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,490
Think I better go see Michael.

68
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,917
Michael?

69
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,085
Oh, shit.

70
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:17,049
Uh, Amanda, this...
isn't what it looks like.

71
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,843
Huh. It looks like you're having sex...

72
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,430
with a woman from the cover of a lingerie catalog.

73
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:27,476
- In our bed.
- Uh--

74
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,736
Amanda, you know what your problem is?
Hmm?

75
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,488
You think everybody's basically good, 
and you fall for them right away.

76
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,576
There are four million men in New York. 
Why can't I find one good one?

77
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,954
Just one. Just one.
You know? Just one.

78
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,623
Remember when you saw the Titian 
and you got weakin the knees?

79
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,292
Have you ever felt that way about a guy?

80
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,589
Lisa, please.

81
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,842
Real women don't get weak in the knees
over some guy.

82
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,846
Yeah, but most woman don't get weak 
in the knees over a painting.

83
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,014
Well, l--
I understand paintings,

84
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,016
and I know what I feel for them is real.

85
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,061
Men, they're just--
They're complicated, you know?

86
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,398
What I need to do right now is just focus
on work and forget about men.

87
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,943
I think that's the smartest thing you've said all night.

88
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,491
Is this okay?

89
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,912
I think I'll start looking for a place this Saturday.

90
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,083
Or tomorrow.

91
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,368
Hi. I'm going up to apartment 9.

92
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,415
Hello?

93
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,926
Hamlet, no!

94
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,221
- Get it off me!
- Get off of her. Come on. Bad dog!

95
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,556
Are you okay?

96
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,725
I guess he likes you.

97
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,394
Huh?

98
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,774
Whoa! Hey.
I think you might still be a little shaken up.

99
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,776
No, no, no. I'm fine.

100
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,111
I just got weak... knee-- knees.

101
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,489
Oh.

102
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,036
You know, you should really learn to control yourself.

103
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,580
I mean, control your dog.
Oh.

104
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,959
He's not my dog. I walk him for my neighbor.
She had her hip replaced.

105
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,003
"Not my dog." Right. 
That's what you say to avoid a lawsuit--

106
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,966
Come on, Hamlet.
No means no, dude!

107
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,302
I am so sorry.

108
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,304
He's a horny bastard, isn't he?

109
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:13,392
- I wouldn't know. I just met him.
- I was talking about the dog.

110
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,602
I know.
I know that.

111
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,147
Can I get you anything, like a Kleenex or a cigarette?

112
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,483
No, I'm fine, really.

113
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,070
Look, it was nice to meet you and your huge dong--

114
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,072
I mean, his huge dong.

115
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,908
I've seen way bigger than that.

116
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,994
I mean, his huge dick.

117
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,165
Dog! Huge dog!
Right. Okay. Gotta go.

118
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,334
It was nice meeting you too.

119
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,130
Oh! Hamlet.
Great Dane.

120
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,925
I get it.
That's clever for a dog name.

121
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,470
Yeah, I thought so too.

122
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:54,141
Oh, my God.
I gotta go. Bye.

123
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,522
Come on in.

124
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,193
Wow.
This place is amazing.

125
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,529
Holly Payton.
Oh, Amanda Pierce.

126
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,948
The rent's $500.
You can pay cash,

127
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,950
check, money order, cash--

128
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,120
Could I see the room first?

129
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,581
Ta-da

130
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,167
Here it is.
Wow.

131
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,795
It looks like a closet.
Oh!

132
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,548
Closets don't have windows.

133
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,884
Besides, this...

134
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,928
is the closet.

135
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,599
Wow.

136
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,560
I mean, how much room do you need to sleep?

137
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,563
But shoes, they need their space.

138
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,569
Now, we have a lot of people interested,
so what is it that you do?

139
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,280
Oh, I work over--
You work?

140
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,325
I like you.
Did I mention you're in the lead for the apartment?

141
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,286
- Hey.
- Oh, you're back.

142
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,248
- Ooh!
- This is Amanda. She works.

143
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,543
Amanda, this is Roxana Miloshslah--

144
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,087
Miloslavzniakova.
Hi.

145
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,382
- It's nice to meet you.
- You know what's nice? Paying the rent, that's what.

146
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,927
G'day. I'm Candi. With an "I."

147
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,681
- Mm. Amanda.
- I had a pet dingo named Amanda once.

148
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:20,435
- A pet dingo?
- Yeah, but me dad backed over her with a tractor.

149
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:24,815
I was find in' pieces of her all summer-- 
tops of trees, my little sister's hair--

150
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,569
Thank you, Candi. This is Jade.
Oh, God, not the ring.

151
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,697
Wow. That's an incredible
diamond. You engaged?

152
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,825
No, it would take
a lot more carats than this.

153
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,661
You're not a smokergirl, are you?

154
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,081
No.
That's how we all got put together.

155
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,750
We are the last four non smoking models...

156
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,170
on the whole island of Manhattan.

157
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,048
Oh, my God.
You're all models.

158
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:53,594
Yeah.
Oh, don't envy us. We're struggling.

159
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,847
- In this apartment?
- Our agency lets us stay here for free.

160
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,475
We like to rent the extra closet -- room--
for spending money.

161
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,644
Ah, yeah.

162
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,647
I don't think she likes them, the models.

163
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,483
No, my boyfriend just left me for a model.

164
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,238
- It's not any of you.
- Whew!

165
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,782
I'm glad we don't have to go through
that one again.

166
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,826
Then we'll all get along fine.

167
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,622
No problem.
Welcome.

168
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,590
I love you.

169
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,222
That was good English,
Dieter.

170
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,265
Hmm?

171
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,395
Hey, Mandy.
You want a blouse?

172
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,981
Oh, no.
Okay.

173
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,322
Phooey. This shirt makes me look like heroin addict.

174
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,491
And not in a good way.

175
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,660
Here.

176
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,329
Take mine.
I wore it once before anyway.

177
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,958
What are you going to wear?
I'll just take hers.

178
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,545
- Say what?
- She wants to try on your top. Give it.

179
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,673
What's going on here?

180
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,593
Hey. Did you know there are two guys 
just waiting in the hall for you?

181
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,679
Only two?

182
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,181
The longer we wait, the more money they'll spend.

183
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,183
On dinner.

184
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,982
Okay, let's back it up, boys.

185
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,067
See if there's anything you like, Amanda.

186
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,779
Oh, no, no.
I'm not really interested in men right now.

187
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,740
Oh, but they seem like great guys.

188
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,909
Yeah, they all seem like great guys when they 
know you're watching.

189
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,328
- You gotta learn to look past what they want you to see.
- Huh.

190
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,836
That guy right there--
Suit's Hugo Boss, but it's straight off the rack.

191
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,714
Tie's a Gucci knockoff,
and those shoes--

192
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,259
Girl, that's between him and Payless.

193
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,637
But check this guy.
See that bulge in hispants?

194
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,764
That's either a necklace box from Tiffany's or--

195
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,766
Oh, hell.
I'll take him either way.

196
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:09,104
So you pick relationships based on clothing and gifts.

197
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:13,025
No, we pick them based on personality.

198
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:17,738
- Now pick a guy so we can go.
- Oh, I don't think I can afford to go out with you guys.

199
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,657
Actually, I know that I can't.

200
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,368
We don't pay.
We're models.

201
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,914
What does someone like you do?

202
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:30,209
I'm a paintings conservator at the Met, 
specializing in Renaissance art.

203
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,086
Oh.
Right now I'm restoring this one painting--

204
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:36,548
- Titian's Bacchanal.
- Yeah.

205
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,759
Uh, and-and one of the faces is blank,

206
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,428
and there's absolutely no historical 
record of what it looked like,

207
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,472
so it's up to me to complete it.

208
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,724
Yeah, we should definitely talk more about that later.

209
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,061
Okay.

210
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,320
Hi, Candi with an "I."

211
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,989
Oh, hi, Mandy.

212
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,033
Facial-Flex?

213
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,494
Oh, no, I'm--
I'm good, thanks.

214
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,580
Wow. You have a really symmetrical nose.

215
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,749
Thank you.

216
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,044
So why aren't you going out with them?

217
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,922
Oh, I can't go out in public yet.

218
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,968
The agency made me get an operation.
My earlobes were uneven.

219
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:25,264
You know, Candi, some ofthe really great faces
aren't necessarily symmetrical.

220
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,309
Yeah, the beauty's often in the flaws.

221
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,854
You're an odd bird, you know that?

222
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,483
Wow. We have quite a view here.

223
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,862
Yeah.

224
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,408
- No way. It's him.
- What?

225
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,660
- It's who?
- That guy--

226
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:51,415
Mr. Fish Tank?
Oh, his name's Jim Winston.

227
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,500
But his head doesn 't normally look that big.

228
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,170
- It's the water that makes it look that way.
- How do you know?

229
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,714
Oh, I know alot about water.

230
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,259
Australia's an island, you know.

231
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,761
I mean, how do you know his name is Jim Winston?

232
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,890
Oh.
He's a fashion executive.

233
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,226
The girls tell me he's the hottest
young guy in the business.

234
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,730
So you want him, eh?
Why do you say that?

235
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,858
That look on your face.

236
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:22,154
I used to see it all the time when I'd catch me 
Uncle Pete lookin' at me.

237
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,368
There's no look. 
I was just shocked because I recognized someone.

238
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,539
Besides, I never go out with guys like that, 
even if I were going out, which I'm not, so--

239
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,834
- You want me to find out where he works?
- No.

240
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,921
I just told you, I don't care
if I ever see him again.

241
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,924
Hamlet!
Get off her.

242
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,053
It's you.

243
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,096
Again.

244
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,516
Hamlet definitely seems to like you.

245
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,268
You mean, he doesn't just tackle anybody?
No.

246
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,646
He tackles everybody, but he only drools
on his favorites.

247
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,940
Well, I'm flattered.

248
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,571
You're funny.

249
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,823
Whoop!
Oh!

250
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,660
You really should have somebody take 
a look at those knees.

251
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,120
You know, they've never done this before. 
I'm gonna have to see a psychiatrist.

252
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,415
I mean, a leg doctor, because obviously
it's a leg problem.

253
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,961
At least let me buy you another latte.
Ah, no, thanks, Jim.

254
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,463
How do you know my name?

255
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,970
I don't remember introducing myself.
But you did, Jim. Remember?

256
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:32,599
I'm Amanda and that's Hamlet.
Jim, Amanda, Hamlet.

257
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,310
I think I'd remember a beautiful name like Amanda.

258
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,438
But you didn't.
Anyway, sorry.

259
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,858
I can't go out with you.
For coffee.

260
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,111
I didn't mean go out with you,
just go out with you for coffee.

261
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,530
Not even to replace this one,
Which I can't.

262
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,950
I got the runs. I mean, I gotta run.
Okay, gotta go.

263
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,914
Oh, God.

264
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:59,084
I got the runs?

265
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,715
So why didn't you have coffee with him?

266
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,967
Because that's what I would normally do.
What?

267
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,012
I'd have coffee with him,
I'd move in...

268
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,764
and find myself alone on a beach in Waikiki...

269
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,851
while he's off with the slut that runs 
the pearl-diving concession.

270
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,061
Oh, yeah, it happened.

271
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:23,108
- Is that the new C.K. girl?
- Uh-huh.

272
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:27,821
- She's cute.
- You know, I heard they gave her 11 million dollars.

273
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,575
She looks 14, though.
Hello.

274
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,078
She's 12.

275
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,834
Question. If these guys are your dates, why do you
make them stand over there?

276
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,796
Have you ever spent an entire evening 
with one of these guys?

277
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,591
It's all, "You're beautiful in that dress." 
"You look beautiful in this light."

278
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,011
"Come marry me and be the queen of my country."

279
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,764
So Holly worked out the "You sit over there" system. 
It works.

280
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,933
- You know, she turned down a full ride at Stanford.
- Yeah.

281
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:59,520
Really? Why'd you do that?
Sweetheart, look at me.

282
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,939
What do I need Stanford for?
Mm-hmm.

283
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,945
- That's $120. I don't--
- It's 1,200.

284
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,114
- Twelve hundred dollars?
- Relax.

285
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,286
Ladies, may I have the honor of taking you to dinner?

286
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,622
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

287
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,500
It's nothing.

288
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,601
If you say you're not interested in him,

289
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,354
why are you watching him?
I'm not.

290
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:46,024
Well, I am, but only to prove to you 
that he has some huge flaw.

291
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,235
How do you know that?

292
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,113
Because I'm attracted to him.

293
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,616
What a cute little bunny.
Look.

294
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,286
Okay, there's the flaw.
He has a love child.

295
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,205
Who's that woman that just walked in?

296
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,291
He can't have a love child without a lover.

297
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,335
And that scumbag invited me out for coffee.

298
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,298
Then how do you explain the husband-looking guy
with the baby pouch?

299
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:13,427
A little menage a trois action. Yeah.

300
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:17,472
I bet they don't even know which one the father is.
Eww!

301
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,976
Ah, schoolgirls.
That's sweet.

302
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,061
Yeah. Seems sweet.

303
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,898
Unfortunately, what we're about to find out is
they're underage prostitutes...

304
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,150
dressedas Catholic girls.

305
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,736
See that?
He's giving them money.

306
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,780
I think the money's probably for all 
those candy bars he's buying.

307
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,409
Those little whores are good.

308
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,411
They even bring the props.

309
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,206
Twenty-one!

310
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,417
Whoo!
Twenty-two!

311
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,712
Twenty-three.

312
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,423
Twenty-four.

313
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,927
Oh, 25!
Okay, pace yourself.

314
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,763
Twenty-six.

315
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,806
Oh-ho.
Stop it.

316
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,226
Now, I am looking very hard, okay,

317
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,603
and I can't see any flaws.

318
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,189
He's like Mr. Perfect.

319
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:11,693
A little too perfect, maybe?
Gay perfect?

320
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,820
He wears boxers, and there are no framed
portraits of his mother.

321
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,409
Trust me, that man is not gay.

322
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,960
I can't decide whether he looks better
with clothes on or off.

323
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,879
- These are great pictures, Jade.
- I know.

324
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,298
Let me see,
let me see-- Oh.

325
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:37,261
Candi, your eyes--
your whole face is beautiful.

326
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,722
- Why do they keep making you get work done?
- Bulk discount.

327
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,475
Look, Amanda, he's having a party.

328
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,561
It's the best time for you to talk to him.

329
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:49,231
Yeah, except that I'm not invited.
So what? We crash.

330
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,233
That's a really great way
to talk to someone--

331
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,485
getting turned away
from his party.

332
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,488
- Who would keep models away from a party?
- Hello.

333
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:59,408
Every man there is gonna be saying, "I wish 
more models would show up at this party."

334
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:03,579
- No, thanks, anyway.
- Stop the pose.
You know you're into him.

335
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,456
I am not.
Um, excuse me?

336
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,669
Busted.

337
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:18,093
So? He just happens to have a Renaissance
structure to his face.

338
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,637
Mm-hmm. I mean, what's the point?

339
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:25,267
He's in the fashion business.
He probably only dates... you know.

340
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:29,646
- Promiscuous women?
- No. Models.

341
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:33,734
Fine. If you think he wants a model,

342
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,777
we will give him a model.

343
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,780
Oh, no.
No!

344
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:42,659
- Make over!
- If you change your mind I'm the first in line

345
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:46,330
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

346
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:50,417
If you need me, let me know 
Gonna be around

347
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,545
If you got no place to go
when you're feelin' down

348
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,883
If you're all alone 
when the pretty birds have flown

349
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,595
Honey, I'm still free
take a chance on me

350
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,973
Gonna do my very best
and it ain 't no lie

351
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:09,269
Can you put me to the test
Can you let me try

352
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,689
Take a chance on me

353
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:16,360
Take a chance on me
I can't wearthis. I look like a skank.

355
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:22,449
You can wear it, honey.
I'm just not sure how long you'll keep it on.

356
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,374
Remember, when you walk in,
you're the most beautiful woman in the room.

357
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,376
Well, you're in the top four.
True.

358
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,796
Oh, and keep your cheeks clenched.

359
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,341
Not those. These.

360
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,970
Oh, and most important, don't forget to turn them on,
the headlights.

362
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,328
Okay. Allright.
Here comes--

363
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:19,548
Hey, Jimmy, a piece of heaven fell into
my office today, I swear to God.

364
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,968
And she signed with you, Nick. 
When did she get the third eye removed?

365
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,222
Ladies. Ladies.

366
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,184
Ladies, the first glass was free,

367
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,603
but this one is gonna cost ya.

368
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,107
My God.

369
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:43,155
Hey, Ivan. Harold.

370
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,366
Hey, Jimmy, just got some new samples in.

371
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,410
You wanna open 'em now or later?

372
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,787
I will take her now...

373
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,165
and her later.

374
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,417
- [ Barks ]
- [Women Giggling]

375
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,008
Bernie!
- Megan!

376
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:06,261
Just because we work
together doesn't mean
We can't, you know--

377
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:10,265
- I mean, why do you have to act all--
- Excuse me.

378
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,560
Hey,Jade? I'll see you.
Yeah?

379
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:17,606
- Where are you going?
- I think I was wrong about Jim. I'm out.

380
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:23,445
So, what was that
you were saying about me?

381
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:26,615
Hold it! Wait!

382
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,675
- Amanda?
- Jim!

383
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,555
- Ah! Ah!
- OW!

384
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,182
Guh!
Oh, hi.

385
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:57,563
I didn't recognize you
without your big, drooling dog.

386
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:00,148
I barely recognize you.

387
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:03,944
Yeah, I live with models.
I was their science project tonight.

388
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,822
So, you're a model.

389
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,658
Oh, yeah. Supermodel.

390
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,704
I meant to say that I hope you're not a model.

391
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,334
You're not like most of the women I see
at these parties.

392
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,629
What is it you do?
I restore paintings at the Met.

393
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,549
- Really?
- Yeah. That's why I'm leaving.

394
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,719
I wish I could leave.

395
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:33,015
- Why? You seemed like you were having a great time.
- Oh--

396
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,602
Well, my job basically consists of kissing ass
and smiling while I do it.

397
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,647
- Ah.
- But that's not really me.

398
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:44,818
So the split personality emerges. 
You're really two different people.

399
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,864
You could look at it that way.

400
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,870
We'd, uh, both like to talk to you.

401
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,664
Well, I don't want to keep
you two from your party, so--

402
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:01,418
Hey, as far as we're concerned,
you are the party.

403
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:12,137
Allright!
Ha-ha!

404
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:17,476
But why did she leave you?
I mean, you're practically perfect.

405
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,479
I mean, it sounds like you two were a great couple.

406
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,815
You know what my problem is?

407
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,528
I think everybody's basically good. 
Then I fall for them right away.

408
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,988
And then I get disappointed.

409
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,074
Hmm.

410
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,202
I know exactly what you mean.

411
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:40,040
Not saying that I was ever the best boyfriend.

412
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,585
Work kept me away for long hours.
She thought it was dangerous.

413
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,923
She thought the fashion business was dangerous?

414
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,592
Dangerous. To my health.

415
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,220
You know, stressful.

416
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,056
Well, I'd hate to see anything happen to you,

417
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,100
and I onlyjust met you.

418
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:05,357
Thereyou are. Jim.

419
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,443
Come back to the party, man.
There's somebody I Want you to meet.

420
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,572
Great. Was the chairman able to make it?
Oh, no, not the chairman.

421
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,824
Just some V.I.P.s in from Antwerp.

422
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:17,536
Okay, okay. 
Hold on a second.

423
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,122
Remember that ass I hate kissing?

424
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,166
Well, this is Belgian ass.
The worst.

425
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,919
Well, I wouldn't know,
but I'll take your word for it.

426
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,923
Hey, maybe we could meet on purpose next time.

427
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,177
A date?

428
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:36,096
Yeah.

429
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,350
You know, actually, my schedule's pretty crazy
the next few weeks.

430
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:45,022
Uh-- Yeah, me too.
I have this big project at the museum.

431
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:49,193
And Mr. Rankin--
Goodnight, Jim.

432
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:51,195
Good night.

433
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:55,073
- Amanda.
- Huh?

434
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,869
- My jacket.
- Oh.

435
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,833
Thanks.
Jim, come on.

436
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:10,339
Forget about that one.
This party's swarming with 'em. Come on.

437
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,781
Amanda!

438
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,915
I...

439
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,376
wanna...

440
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,503
go out with you.

441
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:53,382
- Asthma?
- Only when I'm under stress.

442
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,134
Look,

443
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:59,471
I usually hide in my work--
I mean, behind my work.

444
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:04,017
So I don't hurt anyone.
I mean, get hurt.

445
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:06,436
I think we're both alike.

446
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,189
You mean, inarticulate?

447
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,733
Yeah.

448
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,944
That's the word I was looking for.

449
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,254
- What are you doing Saturday?
- Huh?

450
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:37,259
Whoa! I thought I told you
to get those knees looked at.

451
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:40,012
And you know What?
What?

452
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:43,891
He likes me without the dress
and the makeup and the stiletto heels.

453
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:47,644
Oh, Mandy, maybe the next one
will work out for you.

454
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,355
Mmm, there's not gonna be a next one. He is the one.
Oh! Oops!

456
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,320
There you are!
We thought you got a room.

457
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,530
You guys looked
so cute together.

458
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:01,116
Guess what.
What?

459
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:04,286
- He totally kissed me.
- Oh!

460
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,955
- You go, girl!
- You are in love with him.

461
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,499
Oh!
Who's that?

462
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,050
- Oh, it's--
- Another woman.

463
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,177
Maybe they're
just good friends.

464
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:22,638
Then why is he closing the blinds?
He nevercloses the blinds.

465
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:27,059
- Maybe she's his sister.
- We are not in the outback, Candi.

466
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:30,312
We are so sorry. Our creep radar didn 't
go off with him at all.

467
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,857
It's okay. I haven't been able
to believe my eyes or my heart.

468
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:37,152
- Why should my knees be any different, right?
- You know what? Forget him.

469
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:40,280
- Why don't you come out with us?
- No, no, no. You guys go ahead.

470
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:43,200
- You sure?
- Uh-huh. I'm totally fine.

471
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,786
Okay.

472
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,707
Oh, Mandy, I can't see you,

473
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,835
but I know you must be sad.

474

[ Woman Screams ]

476
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,888
- Oh, my God!
- Did someone scream?

477
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,015
Temporary blindness has improved my hearing.

478
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,142
You guys, get out here.

479
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:11,687
What?
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

480
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,231
- What's happening?
- Are they having sex?

481
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:16,733
- I think he killed her.
- How do you mean, "killed"?

482
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:21,029
Killed, as in dead.

483
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:25,826
Well, Where's the body?
Huh?

484
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,246
She's gone.
She was lying right there.

00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:32,040
Where are you going?
You're calling him?

486
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:35,043
Yeah, I wanna make sure he didn't hurt himself
while he was killing the blonde.

487
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,422
- That's so sweet.
- I'm calling the police.

488

Hi. Um, I'd like
to report a murder.

I'll hold.

How many screams did you hear?
Just one.

It's right here?
It's right here.

492
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:57,816
And so you turned around and, poof, 
the body just disappears?

493
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,903
I didn't say "poof", I believe I said "bam."
And bam, the body's gone.

494
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,821

Okay.

Well, there were the Catholic schoolgirls--

498
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,707
What did he do with the schoolgirls?

499
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:16,001
He was buying candy bars.
But that's not--

500
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,545
- Were the schoolgirls witnesses or accomplices?
- Well, I don't know,

00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,429
- because of the old lady, the big dog and the love child.
- The love child?

504
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:30,098
Look, forget about the love child. 
I will tell you exactly what I saw--

505
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:33,769
We saw him lifting.
The body didn't disappear? You saw him lift it?

506
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:37,564
No! We saw him lift himself
up and down, up and down.

507
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:41,276
Yeah, he gets very sweaty.

508
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:44,780
- Okay, so you didn't see him lift the body?
- Like I told you before--

509
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:47,783
- We were in middle of wardrobe change.
- Was anybody else in the room?

510
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,202
I was in the room, yes.

511
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,206
Okay.

512
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,291
I think I've heard as much as I need.

513
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,795
Look, I don't think you're taking this very seriously.

514
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,005
Hey, to be honest, I don't believe any of this.

515
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,092
Bunch of bored models sitting around
sniffing a little nailpolish,

516
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:08,428
and then suddenly, bam, you think you see something.

517
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:11,598
Don't get all hysterical.
I'm stillgonna investigate it. It is myjob.

518
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:14,810
Nobody pays me $1,000 a day to sit on my duff 
looking pretty.

- You guys just getting home? It's 7:00 in the morning.

- Yeah. The team had to fly to Atlanta.
- Yeah.

529
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:21,668
- So I guess Jim didn't do it.
- Why do you say that? Is it in the paper?

530
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:24,713
No. He's standing right there in his apartment.

531
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,930
What the--

532
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,852
No, I will not "buzz off" until you tell me why
Winston is still in his apartment.

533
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,897
Is he out on bail?
Do murderers usually get bail?

534
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,484
No, sometimes
we just release 'em for fun.

535
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:49,029
Look, no body, no crime.
Then how do you explain what I saw?

536
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:52,157
The woman, Megan O'Brien?
She tripped over a rug.

537
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,368
When you turned your back,
Mr. Winston picked her up.

538
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,412
- So he's not a killer.
- Actually, he seems like a great guy.

539
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,456
And this Megan woman, she's okay?

540
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:02,960
- I guess.

541
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:07,798
What do you mean you guess?
It's a yes-or-no question.

542
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:12,469
Look, we haven't talked to her yet.
She's out of town. We'll track her down.

543

When you talk to her, can you call me immediately?

544

This is very important to me.
Sure, Ms. Pierce.

545
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:20,602

Not one step further. 
This place is filthy.

550
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:56,221
- Hey.
- Oh, Amanda, I was talking to my shrink this morning,

551
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,223
and she said that you were projecting.

552
00:34:58,307 --> 00:35:00,225
What you thought you saw Jim do through the window...

553
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,811
was actually your own desire to kill all 
your ex-boyfriends.

554
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:05,355
Why are you talking to your therapist about me?

555
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,482
She says I talk way too much about myself.

556
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:12,196
Amanda, we came down here because we decided you should
keep your date with Jim.

557
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:16,533
He's too cute to be a killer.
And you said the cops don't have anything on him, so--

558
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,578
Look, you guys, I appreciate the effort. Really, I do.
But guess what.

559
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,748
I am not going out with Mr. Psycho Killer, so go home.

560
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:26,293
- Please don't make them go home.
- Amanda, seriously.

561
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,879
- You really don't know what happened.
- That is not true.

562
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:31,757
- You guys didn't see what I saw.
- And you didn't see what we saw...

563
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,218
- when you were on the stairs with him.
- And what was that?

564
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:38,472
- That you're crazy sick in love.
- That is not true. I am 100% over him.

565
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:42,309
Yeah. That's why you spent the whole morning staring
at that drawing of his face.

566
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:46,146
So? Big deal. He has a good face.

567
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:50,651
And yeah, maybe there's some mysterious yet valid
explanation for what I saw.

568
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:54,738
But why should I go out with him when he's shaping up 
to be a bigger liar than the rest?

569
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:57,658
So What?
All men lie. We know that.

570
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:01,578
Exactly. If you don't like what the police aren't doing,
start your own investigation.

571
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:05,916
- What are you--
- That way you can find out if he's nice or a slasher.

572
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:10,170
Or if he's lying about being married. 
Don King fooled me on that one-- twice.

573
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:12,256
Look!
I don't care about him!

574

Amanda, ifyou don't sort this out,

575
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,636
you'll never have a good relationship
for the rest of your life.

576
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,347
You'll end up a pathetic, lonely old woman...

577

who makes her co-workers watch videos of her 
cat's lame-ass birthday parties.

I don't care about the baby-sitting or his eyes...

or the fact that he can do a zillion "pully-uppy" 
things on that bar.

And I don't care about his sexy grin...

or the fact that he can make me laugh even when
his dog is trying to hump me.

And I really don't care...

that I fall asleep every night dreaming about him.

something seriously off with this guy...

Don't worry. I've stuffed it
in to tighter holes than this!

836
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,794
Jeez!
YoW!

837
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:32,963
What are you doing?
It's gonna blow, man! Get out!

838
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:38,468
That can't be good.

839
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:41,555
Shit!

840
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:48,687
Okay, don't move.

841
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:54,651
Uh, hey, hey, Jim?
What's going on here? Where are we exactly?

842
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:56,737
Hmm?

843
00:53:56,862 --> 00:53:58,864
Allright. You can open 'em up now.

844
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:02,576
Well, I light the sun

845
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:06,079
And the darkness will turn into light
Jim, how did you--

846
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:09,291
I know some people.
I used to clean the aquariums here when I was a kid.

847
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,376
They're amazing.

848
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:13,795
Yeah, they're beluga whales.

849
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:16,715
- That's, um, Ben,
- Uh-huh.

850
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:19,301
and that's Betty.

851
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,595
That's Ben's second wife.
Oh.

852
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,850
Whenever I get stressed out, I come here, 
watch these guys, try to be more like them.

853
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:31,939
Mr. Fish Tank.
What?

854
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:34,233
Mr. Fish Tank.
That's what Candi--

855
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:39,696
Now I see the world
That's what I'm gonna start calling you.

856
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:41,782
For the first time

857
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:47,621
Cause I'll light the sun

858
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:52,543
And the darkness will turn into light

859
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:56,713
Now I see the world

860
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:59,967
For the first time

861
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,887
For the first time

862
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:10,769
Butterfly flies and a bird doesn't swim

863
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:14,773
You told me you'd get--
Wait.

864
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:17,526
This might not seem like the most guy-like thing to say,

865
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:19,903
but do you think we're moving too fast?

866
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,531
I mean, you hardly know me.

867
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:25,868
Oh, I feel like I know you all too well.

868
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:29,872
Somehow, already.

869
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:41,800
You're right. I've wanted to do this ever since 
Hamlet first drooled on you.

870
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:44,553
Me too.

871
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,264
Do you believe in love at first sight?

872
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:50,726
At first sight? It's too easy.

873
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:54,479
I believe in taking a deeper look.

874
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:05,574
So I keep waiting and waiting and waiting

875
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,953
Hey. How ya doin'?

876
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:14,249
Ahh!
No!

877
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,506
Watch it, stinky!
You smell like poop.

878
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:22,841
- Do you think we should tell Amanda?
- I don't know!

879
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:25,052
Ugh!
It's probably nothing.

880
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:27,596
- We should probably say something.
- Yeah, but...

881
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,390
I don't want to be the one that  ruins their relationship.

882
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:34,102
Which seems to be going very well. 
They're really clicking sexually.

883
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:38,106
- How do you know?
- She forgot to pull down the blinds!

884
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:42,653
Ooh!
Uh!

885
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:58,794
Okay. I'm starting a new religion.

886
00:56:58,919 --> 00:57:01,129
It's called "Amanda-ism,"

887
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:04,466
and basically it's me worshipping you.

888
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:09,346
Well then, it's time for a little confession.

889
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:14,268
You have to start telling me a little bit
more about yourself.

890
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:16,770
Like what?
Anything.

891
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:19,982
Just tell me all your secrets.

892
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:22,609
Well, I'm not really a secrets kind of guy.

893
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,862
Come on!

894
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:28,782
- Everybody has some secrets.
- Well...

895
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:31,785
there is one fact I've been hiding from you.

896
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,288
Mmm.
Mmm.

897
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:41,128
I happen to be a master... of daggers.

898
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:43,463
What is he doing?

899
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,465
Jade, I think you were wrong about those cheese knives.

900
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:48,385
- A master of daggers?
- Oh, yes.

901
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,513
You know, I wasjust teasing.

902
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:54,308
Oh, my God. I should have never
let her go overthere tonight.

903
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:07,613
- Now I know your secret.
- What?

904
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:09,823
- Now I know your secret.
- What?

905
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:12,201
You throw like a girl.

906
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,204
Whoa!

907
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:40,020
Oh, man! I forgot to close the blinds.

908
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:44,066
Darling, after that performance,
I want to be your friend.

909
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,944
Yeah. Hey, how'd you do that thing with your back?

910
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:50,739
Okay. I can get really freaked out about this, 
but guess what.

911
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:54,701
Jim is taking me to Shelter Island for the weekend,

912
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,037
and he says he has something important he wants to tell me.

913
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,414
Congratulations. You bag him.
AWW.

914
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,708
I know, I know. I don't wanna get too excited,

915
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:04,044
but we're leaving early, so I gotta get to work.

916
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:08,006
- Wow, that was fast.
- Okay, if they get married, I'll throw a shower.

917
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,425
- I'll do the pictures.
- I do groomsmen.

918
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:13,053
Hold on.
He's taking her away?

919
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:16,890
Maybe permanently away?
Oh.

920
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,268
Hey, Roxana, could I borrow
that Richard Tyler thing again?

921
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:22,604
I don't know.
I give to you, I may never see again.

922
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:24,606
Come on.
Fine. Take it away.

923
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:27,568
Thanks.

924
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,487
Wait.

925
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:32,739
Did I miss something here?

926
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:36,034
At yesterday's show, I heard some guy...

927
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:39,204
ask Jim about that woman who disappeared, and--

928
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,248
And you were worried about me.
Well, yeah.

929
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:44,459
Hey, you guys. Thought we could walk to work together.

930
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:46,837
Lisa, I only live a block from the museum.

931
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:48,839
Thought you could use the company.

932
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:52,593
Look, Holly, please.
Don't be worried. It's okay.

933
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,636
I have followed him, I have searched his apartment,

934
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:57,306
and now that I know him intimately--

935
00:59:57,431 --> 01:00:02,186
Darling, you left the blinds up.
We all know him intimately.

936
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:06,773
Believe me, Amanda, We really want it to 
work out between you and Jim.

937
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,109
I mean, if it could work out
for you guys after all this--

938
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:12,321
Yeah, I mean, now we're all
beachfront property in the Hamptons,

939
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:15,699
but in a few years, we're gonna be condos in Jersey.

940
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:18,827
I am gonna want a real relationship before that happens--

941
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,663
preferably with a four-carat ring,
D-flawless.

942
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:26,335
- Oh, that is so sweet.
- Yeah, me too. Only I want A-flawless.

943
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,171
Roxy, there is no "A."
Diamondratings start With "D."

944
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:31,340
Ha-ha, you can't fool me.
I Want "A."

945
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:39,264
Nice work, Amanda.

946
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:41,975
Yes, the face is perfect.

947
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,311
Yes, it is.

948
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:48,273
Come over and see it sometime.
All right, I will.

949
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:04,122
No.

950
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:09,336
I've been impressed with the way you do business.

951
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:14,007
We very much appreciate how you've handled 
the little problem with the woman.

952
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,678
Oh, that was no problem.
I do have a question, though.

953
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:19,721
Antwerp.
Yes.

954
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:22,516
How does the money get back here?
Don't worry.

955
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:25,102
I'm going to explain everything to you.

956
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:27,855
I have plans to increase your role
within the organization.

957
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,358
Excellent.
Where are we meeting?

958
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:34,361
There's time for just a brief meeting
out on the runway at 5:00.

959
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,864
Great. Which airport?
Uh, which one? What's that?

960
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:39,533
Jim! Mr. Halloran.

961
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:41,618
- Amanda.
- What's this?

962
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:45,038
All she did was trip over a rug. Then you helped her up. 
Why is she dead?

963
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:46,915
What are you talking about?

964
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:49,126
This is the woman I saw in your apartment,

965
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:52,671
the woman I saw killed by you.

966
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:55,674
What?
What do you mean, "saw"?

967
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:58,218
My apartment overlooks yours, and I 
can see everything that you do.

968
01:01:58,343 --> 01:02:01,096
I know, I know
I should have told you, but I didn't.

969
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:05,309
Mr. Halloran knows.
Well, wait a minute. How do you know Mr. Halloran?

970
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:07,477
Amanda, oh, my God.
We really need to talk.

971
01:02:07,603 --> 01:02:10,063
Let's get to the car.
We're running late, aren't we?

972
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:12,399
I'm not going anywhere with you.

973
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:16,612
I think we should all have a talk.

974
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:27,915
Aaah!

975
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,086
Let go ofme!

976
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,312
Follow them!
Shh!

977
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:54,191
I was wrong about the girls. They did see something.
Let's take care of this.

978
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,944
I can't believe this is happening.

979
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,905
You're gonna whack me.
You're gonna take me to New Jersey and whack me!

980
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:01,823
Stop it, okay?
I'm not gonna whack you.

981
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,868
Why was Mr. Halloran shooting at me?
Because he's not Mr. Halloran.

982
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:08,372
He's Vadim Strukov, a very well-connected Russian criminal.

983
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:11,667
- So what? Are you a cop?
- Kind of.

984
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:14,253
"Kind of"? Let me see your badge!

985
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:16,630
- I don't have one.
- Why don't you have a badge?

986
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:18,924
- Because I'm undercover.
- Oh, hey, you know what?

987
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:23,220
I'm undercover too.Did you wanna see my badge?
Oopsie! I don't have one!

988
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:26,515
Let me out!

989
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:38,527
Will you stop it?
What's the matter with you?

990
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:40,988
But I saw you. I saw you murder that woman.

991
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:43,907
- No, you didn't. There was no murder.
- Uh-huh.

992
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:46,118
That whole thing was staged for Strukov,

993
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,203
who was on a roof across the courtyard watching.

994
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,330
What are you talking about?

995
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:53,834
I'm a federal agent.
With the F.B.I.?

996
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:56,628
So's Megan.

997
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:59,173
F.B.I.?
Yes.

998
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:03,969
Megan's cover got blown, so we staged it as 
a way for me to prove my loyalty. 

999
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:07,347
That picture in the Post?
We planted it.

1000
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:09,725
Strukov was getting suspicious that no body had turned up.

1001
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:12,186
Oh. Well, what do these Russian guys do?

1002
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:15,314
Criminals like Strukov make hundreds 
of millions of illegal dollars.

1003
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:19,359
They can't just put it in a bank. 
They find a young hotshot like me.

1004
01:04:19,443 --> 01:04:22,029
They give me the money,
I buy the dresses from Antwerp.

1005
01:04:22,112 --> 01:04:24,698
Then they import them back here, and the money's clean.

1006
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:27,701
But hundreds of millions of dollars. 
They must be selling a lot of dresses.

1007
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,453
But they're not.
They sell hardly any.

1008
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:31,830
- How do they get their money back?
- I was about to find out...

1009
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:34,291
before you showed up early and blew my cover.

1010
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:38,462
Well, I was only early because I was so excited 
about going away for the weekend with you.

1011
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:44,384
Amanda, I'm sorry.

1012
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:48,722
I didn't plan to meet you or to get so 
involved with you or--

1013
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:51,099
Hold on.
I think I'm getting through.

1014
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:55,108
Hey. It looks like Halloran is actually Vadim Strukov.
He's the chairman.

1015
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:57,648
It was under my nose the whole time.

1016
01:04:57,773 --> 01:05:01,902
He was talking about a meeting on a runway at 5:00,
but I don't know which airport.

1017
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:05,906
Cover 'em all.
Wait. Those were bullet holes in Mr. Halloran's painting.

1018
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,617
What?
What are you talking about?

1019
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:12,788
I'm privately restoring a painting for Mr. Halloran.
That's how we met.

1020
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:16,448
- Oh, my God, it was a Russian painting.
- He's been to your apartment?

1021
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,002
Why, you think my roommates are in danger?

1022
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:23,006
Oh, crap.

1023
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:38,605
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.
Waiting list does not begin for another five hours.

1024
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,278
Okay, maybe you can jump the list.

1025
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:53,328
Stay here.

1026
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:58,584
F.B.I.! Freeze!

1027
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:02,504
Put your hands on your head.
Not you, girls. Him.

1028
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,718
Hamlet, stay.
Hamlet, no!

1029
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:20,647
Oh, these handcuffs are too tight.

1030
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:29,698
Okay, would somebody friendly please
tell me what is going on?

1031
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:32,534
- Jim's an undercover F.B.I. agent.
- No, he not.

1032
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:35,120
Everybody knows he's Jim Winston.

1033
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:39,583
Oh, my God. Jim Winston isn't even your real name.

1034
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:45,130
I slept with a man, and I don't even know his real name.

1035
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:48,383
- Okay, so what's your real name?
- It's, uh, Smoot.

1036
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:51,011
- Bob Smoot.
- "Bob Smoot."

1037
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:55,516
- Hi.
- I'm gonna die handcuffed next to a guy named Bob Smoot?

1038
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,394
I can't die here. 
This place is full of ugly dresses.

1039
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,523
Jim or Bob or whateveryour name is,

1040
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:06,401
if ever you're pretending to be in the fashion 
business again, a little note:

1041
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:10,030
except for strippers, women like jewelry on 
their fingers, not on their tits.

1042
01:07:10,155 --> 01:07:12,115
Maybe there are a lot of strippers in Antwerp.

1043
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:14,201
Antwerp? Nobody makes dresses in Antwerp.

1044
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:17,746
The only thing that comes from Antwerp is diamonds.
Good ones.

1045
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:23,710
What are you doing?

1046
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:26,421
Stop it. Stop it!
That's disgusting!

1047
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:28,757
Stop it!

1048
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:32,219
Smoot is kinky.

1049
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:36,723
If that was a rhinestone,

1050
01:07:36,849 --> 01:07:39,726
I would have been able to crush it 
instead of chipping my tooth.

1051
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:41,728
Huh?
The dresses.

1052
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:45,232
I was so obsessed about tracking the money,
I forgot about the dresses.

1053
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:47,901
Antwerp-- Russia.

1054
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:51,154
They were never laundering money.
They were smuggling diamonds.

1055
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,741
But you can go to Tiffany's and have a fat businessman 
buy you all the diamonds you want.

1056
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:58,787
Yeah, but not Russian diamonds.
Is illegal to take diamonds out of country.

1057
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:03,208
Oh, Holly, you borrowed my panties again.
Diamonds?

1058
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:06,879
That's why Strukov never let me take one for girlfriend.

1059
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:10,048
Or wife. Bastard!

1060
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:12,759
Harold, I'll make a deal with you right now.

1061
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:14,761
Get us out of here
and turn state's evidence,

1062
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:17,264
I guarantee they'll go easy on you.

1063
01:08:17,347 --> 01:08:20,184
Think about it, Harold.
Federal witness protection program.

1064
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:22,477
We're booking people into Hawaii right now.

1065
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:28,609
Tsk, tsk. Harold.

1066
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:37,284
Da.

1067
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:40,287
OW!

1068
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:45,626
Whoa. At least he wasn't lying about that black belt.

1069
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:54,343
What are you doing?
It's evidence.

1070
01:08:55,552 --> 01:08:57,804
What are you doing?
Tennis bracelet.

1071
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:04,978
You see?
The diamonds are replaced by cheap zirconiums...

1072
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:07,022
before they go to the shipping floor.

1073
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,816
So everything we've been through together has been a lie.
No, not everything.

1074
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,818
Just the little things.
Like your name, your job,

1075
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:14,404
the fact that all of your ex's are in the
witness protection program?

1076
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:39,721
The limo!
Get in the limo!

1077
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,392
Excuse me.

1078
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,020
Who the hell are you people?

1079
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:49,022
Hey, hey!
This is my limo!

1080
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:51,650
My limo!
Ladies! OW!

1081
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:58,490
- Stay down!
- Don't worry. I got the limo at the Jackie auction.

1082
01:09:58,574 --> 01:10:02,225
- It's totally bulletproof.
- Mr. Alfredo?

1083
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:07,416
Oh, my God. I'm Candi, and let me just say,
it's such an honor to meet you.

1084
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,710
Oh, thank you, dear, but don't tease.

1085
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:13,463
It's bad enough that half my 
models canceled on me with the flu.

1086
01:10:13,589 --> 01:10:15,841
What am I supposed to do
for my 5:00 runway show?

1087
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:17,885
Who's that?
It's Alfredo.

1088
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,095
Everybody knows Alfredo does the hottest runway.

1089
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,431
Yeah.

1090
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:25,100
- RunWay?
- What? What is it?

1091
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:28,270
-Jesus!
- So, Alfredo, do you need models?

1092
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:30,480
Well, what the hell have I been saying?

1093
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:32,399
Well, what the hell do we look like?

1094
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:35,360
- Vince, it's Jim. Look, I don't think--
- Models with attitude.

1095
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:38,238
It couldbe a fashion show runway.
I like it. You're hired.

1096
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:40,991
All of you.
Yea!

1097
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:43,410
Hey, we're still being chased
by those Russian guys.

1098
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:48,248
We lost those losers ages ago, and your hanging 
with the Jim-man just got us a good gig.

1099
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:51,376
I know I screwed up.
No, I had him, but lost him.

1100
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:53,629
Look, Amanda showed up early and blew my cover.

1101
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:57,591
No, I didn't tell her Who I--
Of course I lied to her.

1102
01:10:57,674 --> 01:11:01,136
Look, no--
Look, I'm pulling up to the tent right now.

1103
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:04,473
If he's at this show, I could bust him. Trust me.

1104
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:15,442
Hurry up. We're here.
Marvelous.

1105
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:19,363
All right. You guys make your way 
through the crowd and get movin'.

1106
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:23,617
Look, I have to find Strukov, but I am personally 
making sure that you get out of here.

1107
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:26,453
Aw, gee, thanks, Jim, but you do 
what's important to you.

1108
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:28,622
I'll be fine on my own.

1109
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:36,046
Oh, thank God.
Allright.

1110
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:38,298
This is the last one.
Make her beautiful.

1111
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:40,342
Oh, no,
but I'm not a model. No!

1112
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:54,231
Let's get cracking, huh?

1113
01:11:54,356 --> 01:11:56,525
Forget about the stupid models.

1114
01:11:56,650 --> 01:12:00,195
Just get Winston and the Amanda girl
and get them out of here.

1115
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,156
And for Christ's sake,
be discreet.

1116
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,659
Don't attract attention.

1117
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:16,670
I look like Stevie Nicks!

1118
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:22,009
Ohh--
Hey, hey!
Where you going?

1119
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:26,930
Holly!

1120
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:57,419
- I Wish I was a stranger who wanders down the sky
- OW!

1121
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:01,006
I wish I was a starship in silence flying by

1122
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:04,259
I wish I was a princess with armies at her hand

1123
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:08,096
I wish I was a ruler who'd make them understand

1124
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:11,725
I wish I was a writer who sees what's yet unseen

1125
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:16,396
I wish I was a prayer expressing what I mean

1126
01:13:57,604 --> 01:14:00,440
Ooh! Ah!

1127
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,847
Yeah!

1128
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:40,689
Get off me! Will you get this woman off me?

1129
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:42,941
Move your hands!

1130
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:45,861
Amanda, trust me.

1131
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:49,740
- Oh!
- Ah!

1132
01:14:55,954 --> 01:15:00,250
Leave it to Alfredo to bring a sense of 
theater back to New York fashion...

1133
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,711
with his new slam-bang show tonight.

1134
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:16,141
I should've guessed that if there was gonna 
be some sort of fashion fiasco...

1135
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,519
that you girls would be in the center of it.

1136
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:21,355
The only fashion fiasco here is your haircut, Sparky.

1137
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:23,649
Yeah, that's really--
Pardon me, Officer.

1138
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:27,778
Ladies, I just want you to know that you'll each be 
issued a special commendation...

1139
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:31,114
formeritorious service
from the director of the F.B.I.

1140
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,910
Agent Smoot says there's no way he could have
cracked this case without you.

1141
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:36,995
So, thank you.

1142
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:43,794
That's five separate commendations,
if you can count that high.

1143
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:46,839
Bye-bye.

1144
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:52,052
- Nice Work, Smoot.
- Thanks, Megan.

1145
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:54,054
All right.

1146
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:59,810
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

1147
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:14,324
I owe you an apology.
I, uh--

1148
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:21,582
This is not the best place for this, but, uh,

1149
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:23,709
Listen.

1150
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:27,588
I'm sorry I lied to you, but I'm not sorry I met you.

1151
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:30,215
Not at all.

1152
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:34,344
So, I was hoping that you could forgive me...

1153
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:37,306
and maybe we could start over.

1154
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:40,350
What do you think?

1155
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:49,484
Uh, I don't know, you know.
I just, um--

1156
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,362
I just ended this relationship with some guy named Jim...

1157
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:56,408
because he wasn't honest with me from the beginning.

1158
01:16:58,118 --> 01:17:01,788
I'm not really sure I'm ready to start 
a new one with who ever you are.

1159
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:04,458
Let's go, Smoot.

1160
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:08,462
We're gonna be filling out paperwork
for the rest of our lives.

1161
01:17:38,075 --> 01:17:42,579
I know what you're thinking, and this time you're right.

1162
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:45,040
I screwed up.

1163
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:48,919
By the time I realized it, he was already gone,

1164
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:53,340
and now I can't find the one guy
I ever really cared about.

1165
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:55,759
- Mandy!
- Did you miss us?

1166
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,096
Hey, how was Palm Springs?

1167
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:01,807
Oh, we just had the best time at that Dinah Shore tourney.

1168
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:05,727
Oh, you finished.

1169
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:09,273
- It's magnificent.
- Yeah.

1170
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:11,358
Well, at least he was good for something.

1171
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:13,402
Have you talked to him?

1172
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:17,489
No, his phone was disconnected when he moved.

1173
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:20,158
Not that I tried calling him or anything.
He moved?

1174
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:23,829
Yeah. It only took two movers five hours
to pack and move everything.

1175
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:28,041
Not that I was watching.

1176
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,918
It's like he was never really there.

1177
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:34,381
Yeah. You know, I kind of don't want
this reminder for all of eternity.

1178
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:36,383
I'm thinking of rubbing him out.

1179
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:39,553
Oh, yeah, I agree.
Think you better rub him out.

1180
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:40,971
Hmm?

1181
01:18:52,816 --> 01:18:56,945
Amanda, admit it. You're not ready to give up on him.

1182
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:01,241
Why does he only have one eye?

1183
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:04,328
That's 'cause you're looking at the side of his face.
He's in profile.

1184
01:19:04,453 --> 01:19:07,080
Well, it makes him look like a fish.

1185
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:09,166
I know a lot about water, you know?

1186
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:17,925
Mr. Fish Tank.

1187
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:34,691
Jim?

1188
01:19:56,547 --> 01:19:58,465
Hamlet!

1189
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:05,138
Hi.

1190
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:09,017
Hi. I just moved into the neighborhood.

1191
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:11,228
Oh. Where?

1192
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:14,857
A building that faces this one.
It's got a great view.

1193
01:20:14,982 --> 01:20:18,527
Sounds nice, I think.
You Wanna come up and see it?

1194
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:22,072
Oh. I don't know. We've just met.

1195
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:24,366
I'm Bob Smoot.

1196
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:26,618
Amanda Pierce.

1197
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:29,913
You know, I've gotta be honest with you, Bob--

1198
01:20:29,997 --> 01:20:32,916
I know.
Smoot is a very strange-sounding name.

1199
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,878
It's good to be honest from the get-go.

1200
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:39,715
- So, what's your line of work, Bob?
- That's funny you should ask.

1201
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,302
I just got promoted to a nice, 
boring deskjob with the F.B.I.

1202
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:46,471
That's funny.
You look a lot like this guy I used to know.

1203
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:49,099
Good guy?
Great guy,

1204
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:52,603
but he's not as cute as you.

1205
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:55,063
Come on.

1206
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:59,234
Come here.
Come over here.

1207
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:03,822
Wo<.
Look down there.

1208
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:06,950
Oh-- Oh, my--

1209
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:11,121
I told you that I had a great view.
Oh, my God.

1210
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:14,875
You know, I heard you shouldn't look into
your neighbors' windows.

1211
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:19,046
It only leads to trouble.
Well, you can't always believe what you see.

1212
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:21,131
A woman I used to know...

1213
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:24,134
told me that sometimes you need to take a deeper look.

1214
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,726
Oh!
Oh!

1215
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:37,231
Whoa. That's a weird feeling.

1216
01:21:37,314 --> 01:21:39,066
See what I mean?

1217
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,653
Can we try that again?

1218
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:44,738
Definitely.

1219
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:06,927
Hey, can you do that thing with your back?

1220
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,000
