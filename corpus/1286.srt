--<i>before the end</i>

1
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:51,459
<i>...and then re-injured it</i>
<i>in spring training...</i>

2
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,121
<i>...on a terrific game-saving play.</i>

3
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,324
<i>You know, I was talking with....</i>

4
00:00:56,501 --> 00:01:00,403
-What time is this going on?
-7:30 is the pre-game.

5
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:03,598
-Who'd you say was pitching tonight?
-Tiant's pitching.

6
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:07,802
-Goddamn Cuban, man. He can hurl it.
-I'd hate to be facing him.

7
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,006
-Who are they playing tonight, Yankees?
-Yankees.

8
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:15,347
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball coming
at you. You don't have time to think.

9
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:18,349
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

10
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,684
He's been hot lately.

11
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:26,092
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

12
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:41,172
Save.

13
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:42,608
The sewer.

14
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:52,114
Hold on, I'll get it.

15
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,886
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

16
00:01:57,062 --> 00:02:00,725
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

17
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,167
Hey...

18
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,571
...you guys know what
would be really cool?

19
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:14,371
-What?
-Driving a car.

20
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:16,639
You know, just around the block.

21
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:18,612
Yeah?

22
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:22,242
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

23
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:26,187
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

24
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:29,225
Just around the block. Who said steal?

25
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:44,608
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

26
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:06,357
See, now it'll be there forever.

27
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,997
Me too.

28
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,201
Forever.

29
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:19,803
Let me ask you something.

30
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,442
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

31
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,582
Huh?

32
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:33,052
Come here.

33
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,857
Get over here.

34
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:51,374
Well, do you?

35
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,707
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

36
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,314
-No.
-No, what?

37
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,486
Sir.

38
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:04,349
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

39
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:09,250
A pack of punks, huh?

40
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,565
You live around here?

41
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,860
Right there.

42
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:22,767
You?

43
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,932
Right over there.

44
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:29,037
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

45
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:34,444
-Rester Street.
-Is your mother home?

46
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:46,223
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

47
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,936
Get in.

48
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:00,409
Get the fuck inside.

49
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,158
In.

50
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,903
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

51
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:35,440
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

52
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,173
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

53
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:08,278
The cop. He had a gold badge.

54
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:11,472
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

55
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,982
-No, no writing.
-He had a uniform on?

56
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:15,847
Like a regular police uniform?

57
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:18,182
-He was a cop.
-He took Davey.

58
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:22,349
-So, what were you guys doing?
-We wrote our names in the cement, but--

59
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:26,054
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

60
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:29,792
-That doesn't make sense. Come on.
-Is there something wrong, Dad?

61
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:51,013
Please.

62
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,123
No more.

63
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:56,017
Please.

64
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,559
No more, please.

65
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:31,218
-Have you seen him?
-Looks like damaged goods to me.

66
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:33,330
Jesus.

67
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,964
You took some good swings today.

68
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:13,536
Dad, I struck out.

69
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:17,334
Good swings, though. That's what counts.

70
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:21,002
I'll never be a good ballplayer.

71
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:25,776
You're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

72
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:30,579
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

73
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:33,417
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

74
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,663
-Hey, see that gutter drain over there?
-Yeah.

75
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,934
I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

76
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:48,436
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

77
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:52,064
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

78
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:55,212
If we could get that manhole cover up...

79
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,348
...could be 1000 balls down there.

80
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,678
Really? Let's try.

81
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,111
Get in.

82
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:34,115
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

83
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:39,348
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

84
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:54,935
Jimmy. Jimmy.

85
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,438
Earth to Mr. Markum.

86
00:09:57,609 --> 00:10:01,170
-What do you want now, Pete?
-Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

87
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:04,213
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

88
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,282
-So?
-So that means less profit...

89
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:09,545
...and more profit means I get a raise.

90
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,279
So why don't you order more.

91
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:14,721
All right, but if the
surgeon general calls, you're my alibi.

92
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,669
-Hey, you.
-Hey, there.

93
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:34,903
I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

94
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:39,038
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

95
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:42,616
-Christ, I sound like....
-Someone's father?

96
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,119
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

97
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:50,588
-Later, Daddy.
-Later.

98
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:52,491
Have fun.

99
00:10:57,035 --> 00:11:00,471
-Later.
-Later.

100
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:28,598
Brendan.

101
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:33,795
-You scared the shit out of me.
-I'm sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

102
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:38,666
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

103
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,974
What will he do if he sees this?

104
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:46,716
Shoot you and then kill you.

105
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,550
It's been six hours.

106
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:56,155
I had to see you.

107
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:00,963
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

108
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,060
Tomorrow?

109
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:07,363
Like we planned?

110
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,971
Tomorrow.

111
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:16,240
Drop me around the corner.

112
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:50,578
-Take it easy.
-He kept cutting me off!

113
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:54,980
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

114
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:59,249
He followed me all the way from goddamn
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

115
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:01,358
That son of a bitch!

116
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:04,222
Can you believe this guy keeps confessing?

117
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:08,593
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab
a lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

118
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:12,426
Hey, Devine?

119
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:20,207
-What you looking at?
-The old neighborhood.

120
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:28,943
-We're done, Sean, but I can stick around.
-No, I think we're good, thanks.

121
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,214
A few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

122
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,356
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

123
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:39,723
Yeah.

124
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:44,628
-So the wife left you six months ago?
-So?

125
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:48,067
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs....

126
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,208
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

127
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:52,809
So, what's your point?

128
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:56,674
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

129
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,348
She wants to worship
at the temple of Devine.

130
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:02,645
-I'm married, Whitey.
-So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

131
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,018
-You haven't talked to Lauren in six months.
-She calls all the time.

132
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:10,319
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

133
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:14,363
One of these days, the phone's gonna ring
and she'll tell me why she left.

134
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:17,797
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

135
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:39,887
Come on, come on, come on.

136
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,519
<i>The pitch. A swing and a line drive</i>
<i>into right field. A base hit.</i>

137
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:47,858
I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

138
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:58,765
Could we please have three beers?

139
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,649
Yeah, come on.

140
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:23,628
You believe those chicks?

141
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:29,131
-Come on.
-Oh, yeah, baby.

142
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,941
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

143
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:38,647
-We've got you right over here, boys.
-Yeah.

144
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:40,613
Yeah.

145
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:44,547
I've known her since she was a kid.

146
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,895
<i>A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.</i>

147
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,475
Dave.

148
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:10,546
It's 3 in the morning.

149
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:11,977
Where have you been?

150
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:16,747
Oh, my God.

151
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:19,487
I fucked up.

152
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:21,614
What happened?

153
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,592
This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

154
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,565
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

155
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:34,098
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

156
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:38,106
-It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
-Oh, my God, Dave.

157
00:16:38,276 --> 00:16:41,575
Come on. Come here.

158
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:47,884
So I'm walking to my car, and this guy
comes up to me and asks for a light.

159
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:51,249
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

160
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:55,017
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

161
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:57,626
-Oh, God.
-That's when I see the knife.

162
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:00,923
Says, ''Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them.''

163
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:02,622
-That's what he said?
-Yeah.

164
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,133
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

165
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:11,105
-You said you swung on him first.
-Jesus, Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?

166
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:14,042
I'm sorry, babe.

167
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:20,415
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I....

168
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,515
I went off.

169
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,184
I bashed his head on the parking lot.

170
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:31,822
There was blood everywhere.

171
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:36,300
I might have killed him.

172
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:40,196
Killed him?

173
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:50,511
It makes you feel...

174
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:53,081
...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

175
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:57,979
Yeah, but you had to, right?

176
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,053
It makes you feel...

177
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,693
...alien.

178
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:13,160
Okay.

179
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:16,169
Babe, you hop in the shower.

180
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,935
And I'll take care of your clothes.

181
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:24,270
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

182
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:26,279
Here.

183
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:41,565
<i>911, police services.</i>
<i>What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

184
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:45,224
<i>There's, like, this car with blood in it,</i>
<i>and the door's open.</i>

185
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:48,167
-<i>What's the location of the car?</i>
-<i>Sydney Street.</i>

186
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,241
<i>It's in the Flats by Pen Park.</i>
<i>Me and my friend just found it.</i>

187
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,072
-<i>Son, what's your name?</i>
-<i>He wants to know her name.</i>

188
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:56,804
<i>Your name, what's your name?</i>

189
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:59,575
<i>We're so fucking out of here.</i>
<i>Good luck, man.</i>

190
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:14,021
<i>Dispatch, this is Unit 33.</i>

191
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:19,261
<i>We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,</i>
<i>and you might want to notify Homicide.</i>

192
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:23,339
<i>Thirty-three, have you</i>
<i>found a body yet? Over.</i>

193
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:27,443
<i>No, but by the looks of this car,</i>
<i>we'll find one sooner or later.</i>

194
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,049
-Yeah?
-I'm in the weeds here at the store...

195
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:44,592
...and I need some help.

196
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:48,528
You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

197
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:52,362
-That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
-Hold on.

198
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,406
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

199
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:07,312
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

200
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:10,145
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

201
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,720
She'll be there.

202
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:14,490
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

203
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:17,889
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

204
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:20,223
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

205
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:24,326
I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

206
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:26,527
What the fuck's going on here?

207
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,045
-Pete, anybody show?
-No.

208
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:41,207
Katie didn't call?

209
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:43,114
No.

210
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:55,755
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Drew, Jimmy.

211
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:58,060
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

212
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:02,163
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

213
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,372
Have a nice day.

214
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:10,639
<i>No, it was Diane Cestra</i>
<i>who slept over. No Katie.</i>

215
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:14,842
<i>Eve said she dropped her off at around</i>
<i>1:00. Didn't say where she was going.</i>

216
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:16,748
Don't worry, I'll track her down.

217
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:20,755
-<i>She seeing anybody maybe?</i>
-19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?

218
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:24,122
-<i>That's the cold truth, bud.</i>
-I'll talk to you later.

219
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,264
I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

220
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:38,272
-Mind if I go grab a smoke?
-You can smoke the whole pack.

221
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:52,952
Can I help you, Brendan?

222
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:57,349
No, Mr. Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

223
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:00,827
-That's Barry's. Next aisle.
-Thanks.

224
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:17,338
-When's Sal getting here?
-Anytime now.

225
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:20,483
-That it, Bren?
-A <i>Globe</i>.

226
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:24,577
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

227
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:27,819
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

228
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,893
No, I just see her here sometimes.

229
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,859
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

230
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:37,766
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

231
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:52,378
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

232
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,981
Shoot.

233
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:57,317
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

234
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:01,814
It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

235
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:05,151
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

236
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:09,425
He's nice. Does sign language with
his brother even though he doesn't have to.

237
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,500
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

238
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:14,866
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

239
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,701
...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

240
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:21,077
-No. Really?
-Straight up.

241
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:27,816
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

242
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:44,566
-Hey, there, bad boy.
-Sarge.

243
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:49,468
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

244
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,006
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

245
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:57,070
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

246
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:58,509
Let's go find out.

247
00:23:58,682 --> 00:24:03,642
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER on his own,
steak knife sticking out of his collarbone.

248
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:07,052
He asks the nurse,
''Hey, where they keep the Coke machine?''

249
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:10,625
-Did she tell him?
-Tom, what do we got on the car so far?

250
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:14,457
We found the registration in the glove box.
Owner is Katherine Markum.

251
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:16,155
-Oh, shit.
-You know her?

252
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,927
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

253
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:22,800
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

254
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:26,909
-Oh, fuck, that's her.
-Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

255
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:31,411
When we were kids. Now it's just
a ''hello'' around the neighborhood.

256
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:35,417
Nineteen.

257
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:37,383
Fuck, man.

258
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:40,148
He's in for a world of hurt.

259
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,919
Do not make her laugh.

260
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,061
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

261
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,530
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

262
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:29,001
...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

263
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:31,198
Okay, perp stood outside the car...

264
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,344
...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

265
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:37,480
...hits her in the shoulder, maybe the bicep.

266
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:40,879
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds....

267
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:45,751
-What do you think?
-Yeah, I dig that.

268
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:48,955
Body of Christ.

269
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:52,291
-Body of Christ.
-Amen.

270
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:56,590
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

271
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:03,332
Body of Christ.

272
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,502
Body of Christ.

273
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:10,007
Body of Christ.

274
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:15,112
So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

275
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:16,752
The killer shows, she bolts.

276
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,481
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

277
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:23,922
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

278
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:33,068
Body of Christ.

279
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:37,466
Body of Christ.

280
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:51,017
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

281
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:55,215
No, I haven't seen him since we were kids.
Once in a while, I run into him.

282
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:58,054
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

283
00:26:58,395 --> 00:27:02,195
-Daddy, Daddy!
-Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

284
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:03,890
This dress itches.

285
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:07,764
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

286
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:10,236
We are so proud of you.

287
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:31,586
Morning, honey.

288
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:35,926
Dave, there's nothing about it
in the papers. I checked three times.

289
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:39,296
It was late, real late.

290
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:43,672
-Morning, Mikey.
-Morning, Dad.

291
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:48,477
-You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
-Yeah, come on, let's go.

292
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:51,813
Come on.

293
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,815
Put your coat on, Mike.

294
00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:59,080
Thanks, Mom.

295
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,764
-Hey, Jimmy.
-What's up, Ed?

296
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:15,632
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

297
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:20,038
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

298
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,008
-Nadine's First Communion.
-What are you doing here?

299
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,705
Just curious, I guess.

300
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,153
That's my daughter's car.

301
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,289
That's my daughter's car.

302
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:49,898
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

303
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:51,802
-Want to take a walk over?
-Yeah.

304
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:54,136
-<i>Trooper Devine?</i>
-Yeah, go ahead.

305
00:28:54,311 --> 00:28:56,643
<i>We got a guy on Sydney</i>
<i>says he's the father.</i>

306
00:28:56,813 --> 00:28:58,280
Oh, shit.

307
00:28:58,448 --> 00:29:00,973
-Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
-<i>En route.</i>

308
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:04,018
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

309
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:07,679
<i>Asking for you. Says he knows you.</i>
<i>Not taking no for an answer.</i>

310
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:09,621
<i>And he's got some guys with him.</i>

311
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:13,092
-What guys?
-<i>Crazy-looking guys.</i>

312
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:17,757
-The Savage brothers.
-Just a ''hi'' around the neighborhood, huh?

313
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:19,765
All right, I'm on my way.

314
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:26,205
-Hey, guys.
-That's our niece in there.

315
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:28,071
-Let us in.
-We're doing our job.

316
00:29:28,245 --> 00:29:29,507
-Let us in.
-Fuck you!

317
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,375
The doughnut shop's that way!

318
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:34,346
-Nick, Val, ease up.
-Fucking dickhead.

319
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,543
-Enough.
-Nick.

320
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,918
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

321
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:43,659
-Kevin, let's go.
-And, guys?

322
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,455
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

323
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:49,758
-But get answers.
-You got it.

324
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:57,130
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

325
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:01,300
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

326
00:30:01,478 --> 00:30:04,072
-Is she in there?
-All we're doing is looking.

327
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:07,876
-Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
-That's my daughter's car.

328
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:11,144
-I understand.
-And it's got blood in it.

329
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:15,621
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

330
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:20,456
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

331
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,860
-<i>Trooper Devine?</i>
-Yeah, say again.

332
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:26,002
<i>Sergeant Powers says you need</i>
<i>to get in here ASAP.</i>

333
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:29,935
-Your location?
-<i>The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.</i>

334
00:30:30,107 --> 00:30:31,938
All right.

335
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:34,100
Make sure he doesn't get through.

336
00:30:34,678 --> 00:30:36,737
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

337
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:40,872
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

338
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,848
Go.

339
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:50,719
<i>There's a massive search underway</i>
<i>for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.</i>

340
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:53,555
<i>All we know now</i>
<i>is there are signs of foul play...</i>

341
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,631
<i>...in a car found abandoned</i>
<i>outside of Pen Park.</i>

342
00:30:57,067 --> 00:31:01,128
<i>Now, police officers have moved in quickly</i>
<i>and cordoned off the area...</i>

343
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:04,671
<i>...but even as we speak,</i>
<i>a crowd of spectators has gathered.</i>

344
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:08,106
<i>We don't know more than that,</i>
<i>but we will stay on the story.</i>

345
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:13,647
<i>Until later, this is Jim Smith</i>
<i>reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.</i>

346
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:16,549
Ready? Bat back.

347
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:21,424
All the way back.

348
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:35,136
I never saw anything like that before.

349
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,664
What do we got?

350
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,377
Oh, Christ.

351
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:10,334
Is that her?

352
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:14,605
Yeah.

353
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,839
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

354
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:21,449
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

355
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:24,485
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

356
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:29,091
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a .38.

357
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,725
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

358
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:34,955
''Hey, Jimmy...

359
00:32:35,131 --> 00:32:39,124
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect.''

360
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:44,263
-Hey.
-Hold on!

361
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:48,707
-Grab him. Stop that guy.
-Hey, you!

362
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:51,143
-I'm fucking going in there!
-Take it easy!

363
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:53,646
-Get his arms.
-Hold him. Come on.

364
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:56,149
-Let me in, you motherfuckers!
-Take it easy.

365
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,213
-Let me in!
-Is she in there?!

366
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:06,260
-Sean, is my daughter in there?!
-Let me in! You motherfuckers!

367
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:09,921
Is my daughter in there?! Is she in there?!
Is she in there?!

368
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,330
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

369
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:15,938
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

370
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:19,098
Is that my daughter in there?!

371
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:22,439
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

372
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:27,174
-Get off me!
-Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

373
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,114
Is that my daughter in there?

374
00:33:30,854 --> 00:33:33,687
No! No!

375
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,953
Oh, no!

376
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:41,654
No, God!

377
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:45,232
Oh, God, no!

378
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:31,708
No one's said anything, right?

379
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:33,542
What do you mean?

380
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:38,245
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

381
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:40,355
Jimmy?

382
00:34:40,523 --> 00:34:42,150
-Jimmy, please....
-Please what?

383
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:46,056
-Please--
-Please what, baby? Please what?

384
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,665
That's her.

385
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,208
That's Katie.

386
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,808
That's my daughter.

387
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:57,893
Fresh-brewed.

388
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,536
So we need to work a time line.

389
00:36:00,704 --> 00:36:03,036
It's details, little things
that make a case.

390
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:06,937
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

391
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:12,873
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

392
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:15,950
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

393
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,213
At the last minute, she changed her mind.

394
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,587
See what I mean?

395
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:25,287
What do you mean, Jimmy?

396
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:30,960
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

397
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,032
-What car?
-You're losing me here.

398
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:38,505
If I'd gotten into that car that day,
my life would have been a different thing.

399
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:42,469
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

400
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:45,611
...she was a beautiful woman.

401
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:48,050
Regal.

402
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:51,452
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

403
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:54,112
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

404
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,454
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

405
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:01,393
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

406
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:04,362
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

407
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:07,560
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

408
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:10,900
And Katie never would have been born.

409
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:14,168
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

410
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:24,480
-You ever see Dave around?
-He married my cousin Celeste.

411
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,458
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

412
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:33,118
Around 7:30.

413
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:36,265
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

414
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:43,027
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

415
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:46,266
She was having dinner with her friends.

416
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:52,740
-Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
-Yeah.

417
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:56,716
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

418
00:37:56,886 --> 00:38:00,378
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

419
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:02,957
And then around 8, she left.

420
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:06,254
-Do you know who she talked to?
-No.

421
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:10,160
Do you mind if we have the phone company
subpoenaed for records?

422
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,563
-No, go ahead.
-Good.

423
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:17,138
You say you spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

424
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:20,365
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

425
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:23,603
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

426
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,011
No, she was herself, she was happy. She--

427
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:28,980
She what?

428
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:32,248
It's nothing.

429
00:38:32,522 --> 00:38:35,616
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

430
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:39,850
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

431
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:43,692
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

432
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:47,132
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

433
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:51,501
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

434
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:55,633
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

435
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:58,474
-Okay.
-It was just a look.

436
00:38:59,015 --> 00:39:03,850
It's information. We collect it,
put it together, see what fits. Little things.

437
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,282
You were in prison?

438
00:39:05,455 --> 00:39:06,752
-Oh, Jesus.
-Here we go.

439
00:39:06,923 --> 00:39:09,255
-Whitey.
-I'm just asking.

440
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:13,626
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

441
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:16,663
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

442
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:20,634
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

443
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:24,104
-Sorry.
-It's all right. It's all right.

444
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,572
Okay, Mr. Markum.

445
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:30,235
-Okay.
-Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

446
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:34,872
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

447
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:44,251
There was this kid.

448
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,894
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

449
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:49,156
What? Remember, it's the little things.

450
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:53,759
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

451
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:56,735
-Barely knew each other.
-Could they have been dating?

452
00:39:56,906 --> 00:39:58,703
-No.
-What makes you so sure?

453
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,400
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

454
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:04,375
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

455
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:07,807
No one right now, as far as we know.

456
00:40:07,984 --> 00:40:11,078
-I mean, knew.
-I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

457
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:14,519
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

458
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:19,321
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

459
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:23,821
And if you think of anything...

460
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,663
...anything at all, give us a call.

461
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:35,977
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

462
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:40,047
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

463
00:40:40,216 --> 00:40:42,116
This car came up and took Dave away.

464
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:45,118
-Abduction?
-Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

465
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:49,520
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

466
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:51,523
-They catch these guys?
-One died.

467
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:54,561
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

468
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:58,758
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

469
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:02,063
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

470
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:05,002
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

471
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:09,543
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

472
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:19,587
Cause of death: the gunshot wound to
the head, not the trauma from the beating.

473
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:23,920
-What else?
-Her and her friends were barhopping.

474
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:27,153
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

475
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,958
One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

476
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:33,125
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

477
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:35,566
It doesn't sound like much.

478
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:37,968
What do you say, Devine?

479
00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:41,370
We'll get the guy, sir.

480
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:45,679
That's right. All right, let's do it.

481
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:54,480
-That's the best you can come up with?
-It made him happy, didn't it?

482
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:58,594
This is Sean.

483
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:02,762
-Hello?
-Is it Lauren?

484
00:42:05,535 --> 00:42:08,368
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

485
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,535
Is he with you?

486
00:42:19,082 --> 00:42:21,243
Is that the baby?

487
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:24,778
Lauren, at least tell me her name.

488
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,292
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

489
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:52,874
Hey.

490
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,651
Would it surprise you?

491
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:00,755
Wouldn't be the first time.

492
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:06,859
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that--?

493
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:09,020
Did you see her?

494
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:12,559
-I heard a car hit something.
-Hit what? Another car?

495
00:43:12,735 --> 00:43:15,602
-Oh, no, not loud like that.
-Like hitting the curb?

496
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:17,636
Yes, maybe.

497
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:20,776
Then it stalled, and someone said, ''Hi.''

498
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:23,070
-Someone said, ''Hi''?
-''Hi.''

499
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:26,709
Then there was a loud crack.

500
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:30,614
-Could it have been a gunshot?
-Yes, maybe.

501
00:43:30,786 --> 00:43:34,153
-Did you look out your window, Mrs. Prior?
-Oh, no.

502
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:37,292
I was in my dressing gown by then.

503
00:43:38,094 --> 00:43:40,927
I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

504
00:43:41,097 --> 00:43:43,759
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

505
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:46,360
Female.

506
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:47,935
I think.

507
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:51,831
-It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
-Yeah.

508
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:54,238
Sorry to trouble you.

509
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:04,719
-Jimmy.
-Theo.

510
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:07,219
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

511
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,381
-She's trying.
-Let's get these on ice.

512
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,925
You got a couple of coolers?

513
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,130
Right here's fine.

514
00:44:25,274 --> 00:44:28,675
So how are you handling all this so far?

515
00:44:28,844 --> 00:44:31,813
-It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
-Yeah?

516
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:34,381
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

517
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,281
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months...

518
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:42,254
...but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

519
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:46,156
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

520
00:44:48,231 --> 00:44:50,131
Domestic responsibilities?

521
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:55,601
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

522
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:58,765
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

523
00:44:58,941 --> 00:45:01,535
It just needed to be said, that's all.

524
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:05,773
You'll come through
because you're a man.

525
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:08,109
Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

526
00:45:08,284 --> 00:45:11,549
I said, ''You got yourself
a real old-school man there.''

527
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:14,315
-Like they put her in a bag.
-What?

528
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,721
That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

529
00:45:17,893 --> 00:45:21,829
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

530
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,693
-Well--
-Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

531
00:45:25,868 --> 00:45:28,996
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

532
00:45:29,372 --> 00:45:34,071
-You don't need to talk about Janey.
-My daughter was murdered.

533
00:45:34,243 --> 00:45:37,906
They put a gun to her. As we stand here,
she's on an autopsy slab...

534
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,878
...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

535
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,713
...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

536
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:50,754
Good to see you, Theo.

537
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:58,389
Eve, just tell them what they want to know.

538
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:01,502
-Who was she dating?
-We already told the Savages.

539
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:04,435
-The Savage brothers?
-They were here yesterday.

540
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:07,974
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

541
00:46:08,144 --> 00:46:10,442
No one special.

542
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:17,047
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

543
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,186
-What?
-She was leaving town, wasn't she?

544
00:46:20,356 --> 00:46:23,723
-Going to Las Vegas?
-How do you know?

545
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:28,761
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

546
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:32,928
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

547
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:36,602
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

548
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:39,638
So who was she going with?

549
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:43,870
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

550
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,042
Brendan.

551
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:48,441
Excuse me?

552
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:51,984
-Brendan.
-Brendan Harris?

553
00:46:52,421 --> 00:46:54,616
Brendan Harris, yeah.

554
00:46:54,824 --> 00:46:56,621
You got an address?

555
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:12,073
Hey, Dave.

556
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:17,879
Hey, Jimmy.

557
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:21,505
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

558
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:25,218
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

559
00:47:30,826 --> 00:47:33,818
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

560
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:36,631
How you doing?

561
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:38,964
How you doing?

562
00:47:40,536 --> 00:47:42,401
What happened to your hand?

563
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:44,897
This?

564
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:50,175
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

565
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:53,975
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

566
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:58,013
It's good to see you.

567
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:00,119
Yeah?

568
00:48:06,195 --> 00:48:08,322
How are our girls holding up?

569
00:48:08,497 --> 00:48:10,624
They're doing okay, I guess.

570
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,133
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

571
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:29,817
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

572
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:33,418
Yeah.

573
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,387
I couldn't stand looking through the fridge
to find room for all that food...

574
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:45,500
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

575
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:48,998
-Lot of waste, huh?
-Yeah.

576
00:48:50,372 --> 00:48:54,638
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

577
00:48:55,244 --> 00:48:59,738
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

578
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:09,424
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

579
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:12,685
...that girl was neat.

580
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,623
When I got out of the joint...

581
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:21,936
...you know, after Marita died...

582
00:49:23,439 --> 00:49:28,433
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

583
00:49:29,578 --> 00:49:32,274
...than I ever was of being in prison.

584
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:42,953
I loved her...

585
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:46,160
...most...

586
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:52,323
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

587
00:49:55,204 --> 00:50:01,336
...it was like we were the last two people
on Earth. You know, forgotten.

588
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:04,138
Unwanted.

589
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:10,584
And it's really starting to piss me off, Dave,
because I can't cry for her.

590
00:50:10,753 --> 00:50:14,849
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

591
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:21,592
Jimmy.

592
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,599
You're crying now.

593
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:32,966
Yeah, damn.

594
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:41,016
I just want to hug her one more time.

595
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,417
She was 19 fucking years old.

596
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:57,665
Do you want me to leave you alone?

597
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:01,227
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

598
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:05,999
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

599
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:25,658
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

600
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:29,419
-You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
-She isn't hurt. She's dead.

601
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:36,398
-I didn't kill her.
-Again, when's the last time you saw her?

602
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:41,872
About 8--
Saturday night, about 8:00.

603
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:44,168
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

604
00:51:44,913 --> 00:51:46,710
It was about 8.

605
00:51:47,716 --> 00:51:52,710
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

606
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:56,387
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

607
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,621
I don't know.

608
00:52:00,529 --> 00:52:05,228
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

609
00:52:05,401 --> 00:52:09,337
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

610
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:13,805
-He's not a thief.
-He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

611
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:18,142
Daughter probably had the same bad gene.
You count yourself lucky, Bren.

612
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:23,409
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

613
00:52:25,087 --> 00:52:27,578
We were gonna leave Sunday.

614
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:31,725
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

615
00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:36,328
Well, that was the plan, right?

616
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:39,499
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

617
00:52:39,668 --> 00:52:42,762
-Ma, I was gonna tell you.
-Just like your father, huh?

618
00:52:49,778 --> 00:52:53,976
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

619
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:56,515
-Hey, boys.
-Hey.

620
00:52:56,752 --> 00:52:58,447
He don't speak.

621
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:02,989
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

622
00:53:03,158 --> 00:53:07,254
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

623
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:12,762
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?

624
00:53:13,602 --> 00:53:14,864
I was asleep.

625
00:53:15,037 --> 00:53:16,834
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

626
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:23,774
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

627
00:53:23,946 --> 00:53:26,744
He came down for breakfast at 9.

628
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:32,213
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

629
00:53:32,387 --> 00:53:36,551
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take
a polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?

630
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:41,753
I loved her so much.

631
00:53:43,832 --> 00:53:46,562
I'm never gonna feel that again.

632
00:53:47,336 --> 00:53:49,531
It doesn't happen twice.

633
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:54,004
Doesn't happen once most times.

634
00:53:55,544 --> 00:53:57,375
Celeste.

635
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,541
-Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
-What are you still doing here?

636
00:54:05,354 --> 00:54:06,981
I don't know.

637
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,782
I don't know, I just....

638
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,825
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

639
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:16,723
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

640
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:19,891
-Could I get one of those?
-Yeah.

641
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,508
One for the road and then home.

642
00:54:31,914 --> 00:54:36,578
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

643
00:54:36,752 --> 00:54:38,583
You've done enough.

644
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,085
To you and Dave for being here for this.

645
00:55:02,244 --> 00:55:05,611
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

646
00:55:06,915 --> 00:55:09,850
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

647
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,679
Good night.

648
00:55:12,654 --> 00:55:15,248
-Good night.
-Yeah, good night.

649
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:36,376
Hello?

650
00:55:40,148 --> 00:55:43,174
Christ. Lauren, say something.

651
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,122
''Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?''

652
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:56,592
<i>Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things</i>
<i>made sense.</i>

653
00:55:56,765 --> 00:56:01,930
<i>I'm tired of caring about some dead girl, and</i>
<i>there's just gonna be another one after her.</i>

654
00:56:03,105 --> 00:56:07,565
Sending killers to jail is sending them where
they've been heading all their lives.

655
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,768
The dead are still dead.

656
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:14,746
Jesus, I...

657
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:17,044
...can't do this tonight.

658
00:56:17,352 --> 00:56:19,115
I just....

659
00:56:20,188 --> 00:56:21,951
I can't do it.

660
00:56:22,324 --> 00:56:24,121
Bye, baby.

661
00:56:34,803 --> 00:56:36,430
Because...

662
00:56:37,572 --> 00:56:41,064
...sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.

663
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:42,971
He was the boy.

664
00:56:43,912 --> 00:56:46,938
The boy who escaped from wolves.

665
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:50,610
An animal of the dusk.

666
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:52,784
Invisible.

667
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:55,086
Silent.

668
00:56:55,657 --> 00:56:57,750
Living in a world...

669
00:56:57,926 --> 00:57:00,326
...the others never saw.

670
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,721
World of fireflies.

671
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:10,761
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

672
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:15,876
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

673
00:57:27,456 --> 00:57:32,291
I just gotta get my head right.

674
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:38,461
Catch a nice, long sleep.

675
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,926
And the boy will go back to his forest.

676
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:47,100
Back to his fireflies.

677
00:57:54,649 --> 00:57:56,082
Is he asleep?

678
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:20,106
How's Jimmy and everybody?

679
00:58:21,209 --> 00:58:22,904
Okay.

680
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:24,940
It's weird.

681
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:29,350
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

682
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:31,952
Dave? Dave.

683
00:58:35,223 --> 00:58:37,191
There's still nothing in the paper.

684
00:58:37,826 --> 00:58:39,555
About what?

685
00:58:40,495 --> 00:58:41,757
About what?

686
00:58:44,466 --> 00:58:48,732
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

687
00:58:49,137 --> 00:58:51,765
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

688
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,471
Yeah.

689
00:58:56,678 --> 00:58:58,202
Right.

690
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:03,109
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

691
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,479
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

692
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:10,386
That seems more important right now.

693
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:43,389
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

694
00:59:44,392 --> 00:59:46,883
But I don't know how.

695
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:08,546
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

696
01:00:08,717 --> 01:00:11,413
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

697
01:00:11,586 --> 01:00:12,883
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

698
01:00:13,054 --> 01:00:17,047
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

699
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:19,921
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

700
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,825
Considering the crime, maybe.

701
01:00:23,064 --> 01:00:24,429
Dave Boyle?

702
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:28,035
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

703
01:00:28,503 --> 01:00:29,765
Could be.

704
01:00:29,938 --> 01:00:33,396
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

705
01:00:33,575 --> 01:00:37,306
-Clam up for no reason, huh?
-We'll see.

706
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:50,184
Hey, Boyle!

707
01:00:50,926 --> 01:00:53,326
-What's it been, seven, eight years?
-Yeah.

708
01:00:53,495 --> 01:00:54,985
Yeah. How you doing?

709
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:56,628
This is my son, Michael.

710
01:00:56,798 --> 01:00:59,164
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

711
01:00:59,334 --> 01:01:02,201
I'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.

712
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:06,102
-So you still with the staties?
-Homicide. This is my partner.

713
01:01:06,274 --> 01:01:09,004
-Sergeant Powers. How are you?
-So you got a minute?

714
01:01:09,177 --> 01:01:13,443
-We'd love to ask some quick questions.
-I was just gonna walk Michael to school.

715
01:01:13,615 --> 01:01:17,551
-I can be back in a few minutes.
-Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?

716
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,209
Sure.

717
01:01:20,822 --> 01:01:22,585
So you look good.

718
01:01:23,124 --> 01:01:26,150
-I hear rents are rising.
-Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

719
01:01:26,328 --> 01:01:28,922
They're cutting my dad's old house up
into condos.

720
01:01:29,097 --> 01:01:30,894
We walked by there the other day.

721
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:33,296
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

722
01:01:33,468 --> 01:01:35,902
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

723
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:40,531
''Neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave.
Get property values where they belong.''

724
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:45,203
Young girls keep getting murdered up in Pen
Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.

725
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,871
Dave. Call me Dave.

726
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:49,983
You said the F-word, Dad.

727
01:01:50,385 --> 01:01:53,183
Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.

728
01:01:53,355 --> 01:01:56,483
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

729
01:01:56,658 --> 01:02:00,651
-So, what's up, Sean?
-Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

730
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:03,764
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

731
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,059
-Who's Celeste?
-My wife.

732
01:02:06,234 --> 01:02:10,466
-How's Jimmy doing?
-It's hard to tell. You know him.

733
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,006
-Yeah, so the reason we came by--
-Listen, I saw her.

734
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:19,246
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

735
01:02:19,414 --> 01:02:21,405
That's what we wanted to talk about.

736
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:25,519
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

737
01:02:25,687 --> 01:02:27,985
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

738
01:02:28,156 --> 01:02:31,683
-Pretty drunk, huh?
-But it was harmless.

739
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,920
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

740
01:02:35,096 --> 01:02:36,654
What time did they leave?

741
01:02:36,831 --> 01:02:39,857
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

742
01:02:40,035 --> 01:02:43,163
-So we'll say 12:45?
-Sounds about right.

743
01:02:44,205 --> 01:02:46,833
You see anything unusual
or anyone--?

744
01:02:47,008 --> 01:02:48,669
Michael.

745
01:02:49,177 --> 01:02:50,906
-Like what?
-I don't know.

746
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:52,410
A guy watching the girls?

747
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:55,413
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

748
01:02:56,751 --> 01:03:01,381
No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

749
01:03:01,556 --> 01:03:04,889
-See you later, Dad.
-You got your milk money?

750
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,925
Fuck, I hated school.

751
01:03:14,402 --> 01:03:15,960
What?

752
01:03:17,372 --> 01:03:20,466
Yeah, me too, Sean.

753
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:26,144
Just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

754
01:03:26,314 --> 01:03:29,408
-Home.
-Home by 1:15, would you say?

755
01:03:29,584 --> 01:03:32,382
-Roughly. Sure.
-All right.

756
01:03:34,089 --> 01:03:37,149
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

757
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:40,755
-Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
-All right.

758
01:03:47,435 --> 01:03:49,027
What?

759
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:51,770
What happened to him in that car?

760
01:03:59,114 --> 01:04:00,979
Can you believe this?

761
01:04:01,149 --> 01:04:05,142
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

762
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:10,179
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

763
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:12,258
...you're not left with a whole lot.

764
01:04:12,427 --> 01:04:15,021
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

765
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:19,394
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

766
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:21,535
Hears a gunshot,
before that a ''hi'' ...

767
01:04:21,703 --> 01:04:24,934
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

768
01:04:25,106 --> 01:04:29,736
She turns into the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

769
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:33,779
-She says, ''Hi.'' He shoots her.
-She slams the door into him, takes off.

770
01:04:33,948 --> 01:04:36,610
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

771
01:04:36,785 --> 01:04:39,413
-I don't know. Something in the street.
-Maybe.

772
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:42,818
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

773
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:47,291
-She hit hard enough to get a jump on him?
-Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

774
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:51,023
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

775
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,396
Wait a second, how did we get to
Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

776
01:04:54,569 --> 01:04:57,265
-We just got to him.
-He's a guy who was in the bar.

777
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:00,272
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

778
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:02,569
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

779
01:05:02,744 --> 01:05:06,407
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

780
01:05:06,581 --> 01:05:08,742
Just a little one.

781
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:17,987
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours,
from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

782
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:20,320
-Sure.
-Good.

783
01:05:21,863 --> 01:05:26,664
-Have you thought about flowers?
-I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

784
01:05:27,001 --> 01:05:28,332
Good.

785
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,642
And the notice?

786
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:37,843
Notice?

787
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:44,116
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

788
01:05:44,285 --> 01:05:46,845
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

789
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:48,716
Where's my daughter?

790
01:05:51,226 --> 01:05:53,285
Downstairs, in the basement.

791
01:05:54,128 --> 01:05:55,390
I wanna see her.

792
01:06:42,777 --> 01:06:45,109
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

793
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:49,608
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

794
01:06:50,018 --> 01:06:52,612
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

795
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:59,118
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

796
01:07:02,597 --> 01:07:04,531
The notice.

797
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:08,199
It should read: ''Katherine Markum...

798
01:07:09,871 --> 01:07:13,363
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

799
01:07:14,108 --> 01:07:18,374
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to--''

800
01:07:18,713 --> 01:07:22,149
''Sister to Sara and Nadine.''
