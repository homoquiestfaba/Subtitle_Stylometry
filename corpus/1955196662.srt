1
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:33,491
<b>THE CONDUIT</b>

2
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,492
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,609
It's an awfully nice house.

4
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,379
Unfortunately it's empty.

5
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,417
Your aunt was planning to sell
it just before she passed away.

6
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:47,233
Un... fucking... believable!

7
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:52,337
You own this?

8
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,784
Your house has a fountain.

9
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,622
What's it feel like to have
a house that has a fountain?

10
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,461
You're going to have one hell of
a water bill, that's for sure.

11
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,943
This place is out of control.
You know what you need?

12
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:33,580
A roommate.

13
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,948
No, thanks.

14
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,883
How are you gonna afford
this place all by yourself?

15
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,288
Come on Mark,
you know it's already paid for.

16
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,289
Just think about it.

17
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:47,659
The parties we could throw here.

18
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:58,237
Who's this piece of ass?

19
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:01,640
That's my ex-wife.

20
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,276
I'm sorry, man.

21
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,246
She's beautiful.

22
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:11,651
Who took those?

23
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:14,453
I did.

24
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:16,555
They're good.

25
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:19,659
Yeah well, I don't
do it anymore.

26
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,293
Why?

27
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:23,963
I used to take
pictures all the time.

28
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:26,399
Anything that
seemed interesting.

29
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,335
You know, anything that
would catch my eye.

30
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:32,572
Then I met her.

31
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,810
Didn't care to shoot
anything else.

32
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,446
She was your muse.

33
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:43,448
Hey man, I appreciate
you helping me move.

34
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,785
I should probably
start unpacking.

35
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:50,588
You got this?

36
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:52,591
I got it.

37
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,092
All right.

38
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,700
Are you good?
Yeah, I'm good.

39
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,069
You sure?

40
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,471
I'm fine.

41
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:09,040
All right, tomorrow we blow
some of that money and

42
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:11,544
turn this place into
a proper bachelor pad.

43
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:14,814
Then we line it wall
to wall with pussy.

44
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:18,550
Trust me bro, it's the
universal cure-all.

45
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,752
Does wonders for a broken heart.

46
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,590
I'm out.

47
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:19,412
Hello.

48
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,514
Hi.

49
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,582
What are you doing here?

50
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:24,817
I live here.

51
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,521
No you don't.
The lady who lived here died.

52
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:31,890
There you are.

53
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,127
Hi.

54
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,097
I didn't realize
someone moved in.

55
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,165
That's my daughter
Rebecca and I'm Rachel.

56
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,134
We just live right up the road.

57
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,436
I'm Eddie.

58
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,572
Honey, you can't keep
coming here like this.

59
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:47,807
Why?

60
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,942
Because they don't
live here anymore.

61
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:53,978
The lady that lived here would
let her play on the swing.

62
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,548
She passed away.

63
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,584
She was my aunt.

64
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,620
I'm so sorry.

65
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:02,889
Thank you.

66
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:07,526
Welcome to the neighborhood.

67
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,695
Honey, we'd better get going

68
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,763
because your daddy's
gonna come and pick you up.

69
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:13,565
I'll make sure she doesn't
bother you anymore.

70
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:14,699
It's no bother, really.

71
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,569
That's really nice of you.
Thank you.

72
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,603
Have a great night, okay?

73
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,738
-You too.
-Okay.

74
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,474
Come on honey, it is so cold.

75
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,043
You should put this on, okay?

76
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:29,514
Baby girl, there you go.

77
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:30,483
Wait.

78
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:34,052
Look baby,
you almost forgot your book.

79
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,187
Thank you.

80
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,155
You're welcome.

81
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,456
-Bye.
-Bye.

82
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:02,180
<i>Hello?</i>

83
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:03,548
Hey.

84
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,118
<i>Eddie?</i>

85
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,721
How are ya?

86
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,091
<i>It's 4 o'clock in the morning.</i>

87
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,993
Shit.

88
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,528
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:23,134
I guess I must have just forgotten
about the time difference.

90
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,572
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

91
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:30,509
Hey, you remember that,
that beautiful green dress?

92
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,548
Would you believe that it
got mixed up in my stuff?

93
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:46,024
<i>Is that why you're
calling at this hour?</i>

94
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:49,160
Well, I called to say hi.

95
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,231
<i>You've gotta stop this.</i>

96
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,805
You said we'd be friends,
so I'm being friendly.

97
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,875
<i>We need time.</i>

98
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,644
<i>We can't be friends now.</i>

99
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,212
What the fuck?

100
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,617
<i>Everything's fine.
Go back to sleep.</i>

101
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:14,052
Lisa, who's there?

102
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,322
<i>I'm sorry.
Don't call me anymore.</i>

103
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,157
Lisa!

104
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,660
Fuck!
Fuck!

105
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:24,797
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

106
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,333
<i>If you need help, hang up
and then dial...</i>

107
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:29,568
Fuck!

108
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,889
Hey, motherfucker!

109
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:54,927
I'm here.
It's fucking cold outside.

110
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:03,668
Come on, man.

111
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:08,373
Eddie.

112
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,644
Eddie.

113
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:16,916
Eddie!

114
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,962
Jesus, fuck.

115
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,698
Eddie, what the fuck did you do?

116
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:56,380
It was just too many
things at once.

117
00:11:56,413 --> 00:12:02,955
My mom, my girlfriend, my job.

118
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:12,465
At the time, I didn't see myself
recovering from so much loss.

119
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:16,300
I didn't see the
point in going on.

120
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,004
Yeah but a lot's changed
since then, right?

121
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:21,774
Do you want to share with us?

122
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,942
Yeah.

123
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:30,949
I've got a new job at Pete's Hardware,
making more money than before.

124
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:35,120
And Beth and I are
talking again.

125
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:40,325
So I guess I'm hopeful.

126
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:42,460
That's great.

127
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:45,430
We're all happy for you, right?

128
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:49,235
Does anybody wanna share
about Vincent's progress?

129
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,206
Yeah, I'm going to say
something right now.

130
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,975
I think he's being stupid.

131
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,950
Let's think about it here, I mean, his
bitch left him after his mom died

132
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:07,118
and he lost his job.

133
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:11,323
You should go tell her to fuck
herself man, fuck that bitch.

134
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:15,427
You don't know all the details so
you're in no position to judge.

135
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:24,102
Okay, on that note, let's take
a break and come back in ten.

136
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:02,440
Eddie.

137
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,317
Sorry man, we started
without you.

138
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,921
Sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

139
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:17,021
You're not
interrupting anything.

140
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:18,956
I invited you here.

141
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,360
This is your surprise.

142
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,427
Astrid, Eddie.

143
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:26,298
Eddie, Astrid.

144
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:29,033
Mark tells me you're
a photographer.

145
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:32,303
I took some courses, but
you know, I'm no photographer.

146
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,105
Bullshit.

147
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,007
You should see
some of his stuff.

148
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,507
I'd love to.

149
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,442
No.

150
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:40,345
Really I should go.

151
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:42,314
You should sit.

152
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:43,381
Mark, please.

153
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:44,884
Sit.

154
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:55,027
Eddie, it's been really
slow at the studio,

155
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,062
it would be really cool if you
came by and checked things out.

156
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,433
You know, I'm just busy.

157
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,235
Doing what?

158
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,471
Doing stuff, Mark.

159
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,441
Like what?

160
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:12,444
Look, it's okay.

161
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:17,481
But if you decide you want to
come by, the offer still stands.

162
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:19,117
I should go though.

163
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,387
Absolutely not.
Your money's no good here.

164
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,724
I told you, this was my treat.

165
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:28,993
Thank you. It was very
nice to meet you, Eddie.

166
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,073
-What did you do that for?
-What did you do that for?

167
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:45,276
I just that it'd be nice if you got
out and did something for once.

168
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:47,345
It wouldn't kill you
to get laid, either.

169
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,649
Mark, I don't need you
to be my matchmaker.

170
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:51,682
Fine.

171
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:53,418
Sorry.

172
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,187
It won't happen again.

173
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,591
I've been thinking.

174
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:03,361
It's been so many years.

175
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:08,232
He's moved who knows where.

176
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:12,603
Probably done it to a
bunch of other kids.

177
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,039
Probably forgotten all about me.

178
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:22,380
And if he's forgotten, then I'm the one
that's keeping it alive, you know?

179
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,218
So it made sense what you said.

180
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:33,158
I can give it power,
or I can take it away.

181
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:39,430
And I choose to take it away.

182
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,732
Right.

183
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:42,100
How does that make you feel?

184
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:48,072
Good, good.

185
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:50,042
Thank you, Patrick.
I know that wasn't easy.

186
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,081
Does anybody else wanna share
something about themselves tonight?

187
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,086
Amy, how about you?

188
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,055
Would you like to
share with the group?

189
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,060
Okay, you don't have to.

190
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,662
That's bullshit right there.

191
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:14,098
Patrick, that's not how
we do things here.

192
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:15,433
She's been coming
here for weeks.

193
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,969
She hasn't said a goddamn word.

194
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:20,305
You know how hard it was for me to tell
you people what that man did to me?

195
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:25,109
Patrick, you know we don't
pressure people here.

196
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:28,279
I don't like people knowing my
shit when I don't know theirs.

197
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,215
That's not what it's about.

198
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:33,084
It's about trust.

199
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:36,387
Trust takes time.

200
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:41,093
And it takes more time for some
of us than it does for others.

201
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:45,296
Amy will share in
her own time, okay?

202
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,234
Is there anybody else
who'd like to share?

203
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,205
Eddie?

204
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,841
Would you like to share?

205
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,184
It's okay.

206
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:08,653
You're amongst friends here.

207
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,356
Yeah.

208
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,697
My wife divorced me.

209
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,500
And I don't blame her.

210
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,172
I wasn't easy.

211
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:32,843
Relationships are hard,
they take a lot of work.

212
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:37,415
Yeah, but, I...

213
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:43,355
I have issues.

214
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:46,491
Why do you think it was
you that was the problem?

215
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,464
I always left the
light on at night.

216
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:59,236
She hated it.

217
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,139
Are you afraid of the dark?

218
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,308
Yes.

219
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,745
There's no shame in that.

220
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,525
Is it the darkness,

221
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:14,153
or is it what you can't see in
the darkness that scares you?

222
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,927
The last time
I was in complete darkness...

223
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,163
I was just a boy.

224
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,634
My parents were arguing.

225
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:35,774
They were always arguing.

226
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,343
This time it was different.

227
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,882
She wasn't the same.

228
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:49,221
My dad was pleading for us.

229
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:55,759
Then I heard my sister.

230
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,267
And two more gunshots.

231
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:09,207
I knew my sister was dead.

232
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,213
I heard the door
to my room open.

233
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:22,554
I heard her footsteps
as she drew closer.

234
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:46,845
Mama.

235
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,620
Mama.

236
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:14,472
Eddie.

237
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,894
Hey.

238
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:39,997
Hi.

239
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,366
That was something?

240
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:47,072
I'm Amy.

241
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,440
Yeah, I know.

242
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:50,442
I'm Eddie.

243
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:52,043
Yeah, I know.

244
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:58,316
You wanna get something to eat?

245
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:08,326
Did your mom really do that?

246
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,468
Why would I make that up?

247
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,503
Be surprised the things
people say for attention.

248
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,609
I'm not looking for attention.

249
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:29,580
How did it end?

250
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:34,853
She walked into my room,
and put two bullets in my chest.

251
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,594
That was the last
time I saw my mother.

252
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:47,432
What happened to her?

253
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:51,535
I don't know, I woke up in
a hospital a month later.

254
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:55,539
My aunt raised me until
I went off to college.

255
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:57,509
That's heavy.

256
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,417
Do you want to go
back to my place?

257
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,463
What is this place?

258
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:21,733
Home sweet home.

259
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,535
There's no way.
This place looks abandoned.

260
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,537
It's not.
Come on I'll show you.

261
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:32,711
What's the matter?

262
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,414
Can you turn on a light?

263
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,519
There's no electricity.

264
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:46,090
You live here without
electricity?

265
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:50,194
Yeah, without A/C, heat,
or running water either.

266
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,496
Come on.

267
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:53,498
Look, I don't do
well in the dark.

268
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,507
Look, it's dark.

269
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:04,509
Are you scared?

270
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,009
No.

271
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,644
How come?

272
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:09,747
I don't know.

273
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,550
Because you know
you're safe with me.

274
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:16,221
Come on.

275
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,042
Look, I can't go any further.

276
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:13,711
But we're almost there,
it's just up ahead.

277
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:15,812
No, seriously.
I can't.

278
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:18,750
I just can't.

279
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:21,086
Besides, it's really
cold in here.

280
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,189
Why don't we just go
back to my place.

281
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:28,226
Okay.

282
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:29,759
Just give me a minute.

283
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,730
I need to grab
something, stay here.

284
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:34,164
What? No I can't.

285
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:38,637
Relax, gimme your phone.

286
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,779
There, now you have a light.

287
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,682
Stay here.

288
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:33,357
Is that you?

289
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,392
Jesus!

290
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:09,793
You scared the fuck out of me!

291
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:12,063
I'm sorry.

292
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,065
You okay?
Yeah.

293
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:17,434
Let's get out of here.

294
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:40,725
Home sweet home.

295
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:43,761
It's not furnished but
at least it's warm.

296
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:48,132
Don't.

297
00:27:48,164 --> 00:27:50,300
You know I don't do
well in the dark.

298
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,946
Please leave it off.

299
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,350
You're safe with me.

300
00:28:39,215 --> 00:28:41,251
Are you still afraid of
the dark little boy?

301
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:43,221
No.

302
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:17,255
So do you really live
in that horrible place?

303
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:23,227
This isn't exactly the Waldorf.

304
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:30,468
At least it's a proper house.

305
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,369
It needs work.

306
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,411
Well you know I have
a lot of space.

307
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:47,985
Are you asking me to
move in with you?

308
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:51,055
Yeah I guess I am.

309
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,277
I hope you're not
just saying that

310
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,933
in the hopes that I'm
gonna politely decline.

311
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,836
No, I'm not.

312
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:10,475
Okay.

313
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:14,212
Okay.

314
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,982
Amy!
Amy!

315
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:34,625
Amy!
Amy!

316
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:37,995
Amy.

317
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,062
What?

318
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:16,299
Why don't you tell me anything?

319
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,469
There's a lot I
haven't told you.

320
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,374
Why don't you get some help?

321
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:28,645
A grown man afraid of
the dark telling me I need help?

322
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:35,119
I'm an asshole.

323
00:32:37,387 --> 00:32:38,622
I want to kick.

324
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:44,061
I'm just so tired of clinics and
doctors fucking with my head.

325
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:50,167
Why don't you help me?

326
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:56,039
I wouldn't know what to do.

327
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:57,408
What's to know?

328
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,576
People go cold
turkey all the time.

329
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,746
You just gotta break
on through, you know?

330
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:06,549
What if something happens?

331
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,286
What's gonna happen?

332
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,063
I'll get my things.

333
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,231
I'm sorry I bothered you.

334
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:24,167
Wait.

335
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:28,605
I'll help you.

336
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:38,375
Amy.

337
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:40,376
Amy.

338
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,612
Amy.

339
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,380
She's pretty.

340
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,882
My ex-wife.

341
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:35,885
A woman worth dying for.

342
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:38,255
I see it, though.

343
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,893
I can see where someone
would become obsessed.

344
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,464
I wasn't obsessed,
I was in love.

345
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:55,505
Love, obsession, what's the difference?
It's viral.

346
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:00,911
One minute you're fine, next thing you
know you're infected with someone

347
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:07,418
and you can't function without them,
you'd risk everything for them.

348
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:14,057
She was my best friend. She knew
me better than I knew myself.

349
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,626
Nobody really knows anyone.

350
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:22,532
These aren't bad.

351
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:25,735
Did you take these?

352
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:27,337
Yeah.

353
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,310
I want you to see me like this.

354
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:37,814
Will you take my picture?

355
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:25,822
Were you sleeping?

356
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,460
It's barely seven o'clock.

357
00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:31,828
Dude, it's a bad time.

358
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:32,896
A bad time?

359
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,932
Yeah, I've got a friend over.

360
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,500
You don't have any friends.

361
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,836
Have you got a chick in there?

362
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:43,940
Who is it?

363
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,809
It's a friend.

364
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:47,677
Fuck you, who is it?

365
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,681
Amy.
You don't know her.

366
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:52,482
Where'd you meet her?

367
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:56,787
I met her at therapy.

368
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,222
That can't be healthy.

369
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,590
Whatever.

370
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:01,958
So I'll come back later.

371
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,896
Well she's actually
kind of staying here.

372
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,798
Staying here?

373
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:14,538
Yeah, she's kind of homeless.

374
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,507
Homeless?

375
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:21,679
Dude, she was squatting in an abandoned
building, I couldn't leave her there.

376
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,016
What?

377
00:41:28,851 --> 00:41:32,154
Your best friend asks you to stay
here in your big fucking palace

378
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:34,657
and you say no
you need your space.

379
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,760
And some little hood rat
shakes her tail in your face

380
00:41:37,793 --> 00:41:39,629
and you roll out
the red carpet for her?

381
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,900
I see how it is.

382
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:44,768
Wait, are you fucking with me?

383
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:49,139
You know what?

384
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:52,643
Have your fun but remember,
rats carry disease.

385
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:55,045
Careful you don't
catch something.

386
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:59,750
Mark
Bon appetit.

387
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:01,250
Mark!
Come on.

388
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:03,521
Good night!

389
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:24,340
Where's the girl?

390
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:26,076
What?

391
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:30,047
The girl, Amy, where is she?

392
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:35,318
Who are you?

393
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:39,822
My name is Gabriel,
but that's not important.

394
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:43,627
What is important is that
you tell me where Amy is.

395
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:46,262
Look, man, I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about...

396
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:48,264
You know exactly who
I'm talking about.

397
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:49,632
Why have you taken her?

398
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,134
You better back off, man.

399
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:54,971
You don't have any idea what
you've gotten yourself into.

400
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,606
Have you been intimate with her?

401
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,942
What?

402
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:00,143
All right, listen, man, you better
stay the fuck away from me.

403
00:43:00,175 --> 00:43:01,177
Listen to me, you fool.

404
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,312
No, you listen to me.
Don't make me hurt you.

405
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:06,083
You're in grave danger,
and I'm trying to help you.

406
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:09,052
Is Amy still on the drugs?

407
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:11,287
Stay away.

408
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,391
Whatever happens, make sure
she stays on the drugs.

409
00:43:14,423 --> 00:43:16,025
Just stay away.

410
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:49,659
Do you know a Gabriel?

411
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:54,798
No, why?

412
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:57,166
Well I had an interesting
conversation with a man today.

413
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:01,105
He said his name was Gabriel.

414
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:04,240
He said he knew you.

415
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:07,711
He seemed to know
a lot about you.

416
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:09,179
What'd he say?

417
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:13,916
He wanted to know where you were and
he also said that I was in danger.

418
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:17,687
Really, how so?

419
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,757
I don't know,
we really didn't get that far.

420
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:24,728
He got a little aggressive so
I told him to go fuck himself.

421
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:33,704
He also knew about your
little drug problem.

422
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,612
What?

423
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,716
I'm sorry, I just find it hard to
believe that you don't know this guy.

424
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:47,783
You think I'm lying to you?

425
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:50,721
Well, I don't think you're
being completely honest with me.

426
00:44:53,155 --> 00:44:54,757
What?

427
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:32,342
Amy, Amy!

428
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,976
Amy, wake up.

429
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,681
Amy!

430
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:41,018
Wake up!
What?

431
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:42,952
Look.

432
00:48:42,985 --> 00:48:44,320
What the fuck?

433
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:46,121
You hurt?

434
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:49,059
No, I don't think so.

435
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,028
What?
Stop, Jesus, relax, I'm fine.

436
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:52,963
Where did this come from?

437
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,197
I don't know.

438
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,199
Just relax.

439
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:01,505
Are you...

440
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:05,040
Are you?
No!

441
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:05,942
Are you sure?

442
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:08,744
I would know if I
was on my fucking rag.

443
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:10,145
Where the fuck did
this come from then?

444
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:12,548
How should I know?
Just fucking calm down.

445
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,023
Hey.

446
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,469
Son of a bitch!

447
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:44,106
Hey, seen Bailey?

448
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:47,677
My dog.

449
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:54,317
You all right?

450
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,322
Have a good night.

451
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:05,228
Come on Bailey.

452
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,297
Let's go home, boy.

453
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:20,509
Are you looking for me?

454
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:22,079
Come on.

455
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:30,185
This used to be department store before
the economy tanked and it closed down.

456
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:32,222
Changed hands so many times,

457
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,157
everybody seemed to wanna
do something different with it.

458
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,861
Previous owner,
they gutted it really badly.

459
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:41,396
The new owner,
she rents it to me.

460
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:44,199
And although it's not
a proper studio,

461
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:48,205
you will see that it gives me
all the space I need to create.

462
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,280
Have a look around.

463
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:26,142
So what do you think?

464
00:52:26,175 --> 00:52:33,182
They're amazing, it's just a
little shocking that's all.

465
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,190
May I?

466
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,326
Yeah, that's why I brought them.

467
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:01,411
You're really good.

468
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:03,445
It was a good camera.

469
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:09,218
I've seen some god awful pictures
taken with a good camera.

470
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:12,221
Have you ever used
one of these before?

471
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:17,393
No, I've seen them but
I've never use one.

472
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:19,295
You should try it.

473
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:20,864
I'll teach you.

474
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:32,208
So do you wanna use it?

475
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:35,777
The studio.

476
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:37,914
You said, you might
wanna use it.

477
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:42,785
Yeah, I wanna photograph a friend and
in a more controlled environment.

478
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:44,921
Cool, when?

479
00:53:46,588 --> 00:53:47,789
At your convenience.

480
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,326
I mean, I know you're busy,
so I don't wanna put you out.

481
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:51,326
I wish.

482
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,329
Pick any night next week.

483
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:08,811
Eddie?

484
00:54:08,844 --> 00:54:10,280
Who is this?

485
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,515
That's Gabriel.

486
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:14,349
He's kind of a recluse.

487
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:17,052
He works at the service
station at the edge of town.

488
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:19,255
Kind of a strange cat,
but he's harmless.

489
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:26,496
Eddie, are you okay?

490
00:54:26,528 --> 00:54:29,032
My God, I'm sorry.

491
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,367
It's okay, stop.
You're gonna cut yourself.

492
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,369
I can't believe I did that,
it's your work.

493
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:35,304
It's all right,
it's just the frame.

494
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:38,775
Eddie, you're bleeding.
Come on.

495
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,380
What happened?

496
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:46,783
I don't know.

497
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:48,784
It looked like you
were having a seizure.

498
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,553
Are you epileptic?

499
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:52,421
No, no, nothing like that.

500
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:54,856
Are you sick?

501
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:57,793
There's a bug going
around, you know?

502
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:01,464
No, just, I haven't been
sleeping well, bad dreams.

503
00:55:01,496 --> 00:55:03,866
What kind of dreams?

504
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,471
Well, it's strange.

505
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:10,507
It's more like episodes
rather than dreams.

506
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,442
How so?

507
00:55:15,143 --> 00:55:17,045
It's like I wake up in my bed.

508
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:18,114
I'm in my room.

509
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:22,085
I can see everything around me,
but I can't move.

510
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:23,320
I can't speak.

511
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:29,791
I can feel things in the darkness,
I can hear things, voices.

512
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:33,528
It's called a hypnopompic state.

513
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:35,498
A what?

514
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,567
Postdormital sleep paralysis,

515
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,098
you regain consciousness

516
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:43,405
while your body's sleep
mechanism is still engaged.

517
00:55:43,438 --> 00:55:46,875
They're two main states
of consciousness.

518
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:49,010
You're wide awake,
or you're sleep.

519
00:55:49,043 --> 00:55:51,413
When you're asleep,
you're essentially paralyzed.

520
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:53,883
Say, you're dreaming
and you're in a fight.

521
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:57,653
This is what keeps you from punching
your lover sleeping next to you.

522
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:01,891
Sometimes, however,

523
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:06,429
we become conscious while the
sleep mechanism is still engaged.

524
00:56:06,461 --> 00:56:08,797
It's like a waking dream.

525
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:12,668
Your mind is wide awake,
but your body's still asleep.

526
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:15,471
Yeah, that makes sense.

527
00:56:15,503 --> 00:56:18,007
How do you know so
much about this?

528
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:22,978
I have a morbid
fascination with the occult.

529
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,414
What does this have
to do with the occult?

530
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:28,550
Be grateful you're not
living in the Middle Ages.

531
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:33,455
You'd be diagnosed with the early
stages of demonic possession.

532
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:35,525
All right, now you're
creeping me out.

533
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,561
I should probably go.

534
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:40,496
Yeah, I'll walk you out.

535
00:56:43,731 --> 00:56:45,500
Is that okay?

536
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:47,737
Yeah, it's great.
Thanks.

537
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:49,838
Listen, I'm sorry about today.

538
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:51,606
No, don't worry about it.

539
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:53,675
It's okay, really.

540
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,177
Thanks.

541
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,612
So, next week then?

542
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:59,047
Yeah right.

543
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:00,883
Yeah, I'll give you a call and
we'll make a plan.

544
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,852
Yeah, that sounds good.

545
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:04,520
Cool, good night.

546
00:57:04,552 --> 00:57:06,021
Good night.

547
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:10,125
Hey, would you like to go
have a drink some time?

548
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,630
I think it'd be really nice
for us to chat again.

549
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:17,632
I'm sorry.
I'm sort of seeing someone.

550
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:18,835
I should have...

551
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:21,070
Yeah.
I knew that.

552
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,141
Yeah, this is really awkward.

553
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:29,912
I feel really stupid
No don't please don't really.

554
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:32,248
I should have said something.
I'm sorry.

555
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,083
No, don't worry about it.

556
00:57:35,117 --> 00:57:36,653
Have a good night.

557
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,094
What are you doing?

558
00:59:37,773 --> 00:59:39,776
Amy, honey,
you're freaking me out.

559
01:00:01,295 --> 01:00:05,701
Everything all right in there?
We thought we heard a scream.

560
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:08,770
Yeah, I was having a bad dream.

561
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:11,941
It's like 1pm.
Must be nice.

562
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:15,378
It was a late night.
What can I do for you guys?

563
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:16,811
I'm Detective Warner.

564
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:18,913
The big guy here is
Detective McConnell.

565
01:00:18,947 --> 01:00:20,282
We were hoping to ask
you a few questions.

566
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:23,686
Yeah sure.
What's this about?

567
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:25,822
Mind if we come in?

568
01:00:32,226 --> 01:00:35,697
Honey, Amy wake up.
The cops are here.

569
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:37,800
Cops?
Why?

570
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:41,671
So moving

571
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:45,708
Looks like you got
more space than stuff.

572
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,744
Yeah, I guess.

573
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:51,780
You two married?

574
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:56,018
No, no.
We're just friends.

575
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,753
Can somebody please tell
me what's going on here?

576
01:00:58,786 --> 01:01:01,823
It's okay, Eddie, relax.

577
01:01:01,856 --> 01:01:06,394
Say, do you recognize this girl?

578
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:08,263
Yeah.
I forget her name.

579
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:12,201
She's the girl that lives
right up the street.

580
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:14,036
Rebecca Green.

581
01:01:14,068 --> 01:01:16,404
How exactly do you know her?

582
01:01:16,438 --> 01:01:20,376
I don't. I met her
the day that I moved in.

583
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:21,911
Did something happen?

584
01:01:21,943 --> 01:01:23,746
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

585
01:01:23,778 --> 01:01:25,815
Turns out she came up missing.

586
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:31,453
Well, that's terrible.

587
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,822
Yeah, it is.

588
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,825
When was the last
time you saw her?

589
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:44,200
The day I moved in she was playing
in my back yard on the swing.

590
01:01:46,434 --> 01:01:49,038
What date was that?
What date exactly?

591
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,208
I-I don't know.
I can't remember.

592
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,244
I'll have to check.

593
01:01:55,277 --> 01:01:57,045
Anything out of the ordinary?

594
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,215
Anything suspicious in
the last couple of days?

595
01:02:03,117 --> 01:02:05,288
No, nothing that I can think of.

596
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,727
How did you two meet?

597
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:15,364
We met in group therapy.

598
01:02:15,396 --> 01:02:17,799
So then you two dating?

599
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:20,103
No, just fucking.

600
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,374
Okay.

601
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:27,409
Well, I think that
pretty much covers it.

602
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:31,914
But if you can think of anything else,
just give us a call at that number.

603
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:33,315
Have a good afternoon.

604
01:02:33,347 --> 01:02:35,817
Thanks ma'am.

605
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,262
Have a good afternoon.

606
01:03:00,275 --> 01:03:02,077
That was weird.

607
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:09,451
What?

608
01:03:09,483 --> 01:03:13,322
What's that?
A book.

609
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:17,992
I mean, where'd it come from?

610
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:19,961
How should I know?

611
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:21,463
It's your house.

612
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:48,891
Hi there, I was just setting up.

613
01:03:48,923 --> 01:03:51,025
I thought this would look cool.

614
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:52,027
It looks great.

615
01:03:52,059 --> 01:03:54,096
It's good to see you.

616
01:03:58,065 --> 01:03:59,167
You must be Amy.

617
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:07,876
Well, should we go get
you all dolled up?

618
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:14,316
I guess I'll set
something up here.

619
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:15,551
You should do that.

620
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:33,902
Have a seat.

621
01:04:48,016 --> 01:04:49,485
Have you ever done any modeling?

622
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,055
Really?

623
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:56,024
That's a shame.

624
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:57,525
You have a great face.

625
01:05:00,728 --> 01:05:02,130
You're shy?

626
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:06,969
All right.

627
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:09,971
You're a woman of few words.

628
01:05:10,005 --> 01:05:12,608
You want him, don't you?

629
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:13,675
What?

630
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:20,382
Look.

631
01:05:20,414 --> 01:05:25,086
I thought he was cute when
he was so vulnerable.

632
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,623
I'm a sucker for that.

633
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:32,995
Anyway, he said that he was seeing
someone so I left it alone.

634
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:37,166
I'm not trying to start shit.

635
01:05:38,432 --> 01:05:40,036
I mean that.

636
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,587
All set.

637
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:01,289
Thanks a lot for your help.

638
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:02,657
You look great.

639
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:04,159
What are you gonna wear?

640
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:06,120
Shit!
The fuse.

641
01:07:06,153 --> 01:07:08,257
I'm really sorry.
I'll be right back.

642
01:07:20,402 --> 01:07:21,403
Shit.

643
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:29,144
Eddie, you scared me.

644
01:07:29,177 --> 01:07:31,514
Wait, she's just
right up stairs.

645
01:08:07,815 --> 01:08:09,851
Astrid.

646
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:13,856
What happened?

647
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:14,856
Astrid.

648
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,262
Jesus Christ, talk to me.
What happened?

649
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:21,163
It was her.

650
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:23,164
I thought it was you,
but it was her.

651
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:24,166
Listen.

652
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:26,768
She's dangerous,
you have to get away from her.

653
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:28,370
What?

654
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,309
I have to go.

655
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:35,810
Astrid, wait,
I don't understand.

656
01:08:35,844 --> 01:08:38,180
I have to go!

657
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:47,890
What just happened?

658
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:04,966
What the fuck happened?

659
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,969
I have no clue man.
What'd she say?

660
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:08,503
She said you made a pass at her.

661
01:10:08,536 --> 01:10:10,972
Then your girlfriend
made a pass at her.

662
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:14,409
And then your girlfriend
got all fucking crazy.

663
01:10:14,442 --> 01:10:16,011
She's not making any sense.

664
01:10:16,043 --> 01:10:17,412
Jesus.

665
01:10:17,444 --> 01:10:19,514
What happened?

666
01:10:19,546 --> 01:10:22,350
Look I was taking pictures of
Amy, but the light goes out,

667
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,164
so Astrid goes down
to check on the fuses,

668
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:25,820
next thing I know
I just hear a scream.

669
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:29,024
I go down and check up on her,
she's crying hysterically.

670
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:31,893
So I try to calm her down,
she takes one look at Amy,

671
01:10:31,926 --> 01:10:35,463
and just storms out the fucking
building, man, that's all I know.

672
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:37,399
It's crazy.

673
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:40,902
Look, there's something
really weird going on.

674
01:10:40,935 --> 01:10:43,305
What do you mean?

675
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:46,041
The other day, the cops came
by my place asking questions.

676
01:10:46,073 --> 01:10:48,409
Turns out there's a little girl
in the neighborhood missing.

677
01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:50,878
Well, guess what?
I found her book in my house.

678
01:10:50,912 --> 01:10:52,514
How do you know it's her book?

679
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:54,382
Because I've met her once.

680
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,485
She would come by,
sit on the swing and read.

681
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,287
I know it was hers, man.
I saw it.

682
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:01,523
Doesn't mean anything.
She could have left it there.

683
01:11:01,555 --> 01:11:03,457
It's not just that.

684
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:06,427
Ever since she's moved in I've been
having these really crazy dreams.

685
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:07,829
The other morning I wake up

686
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:11,300
and our fucking bed is covered in
blood and neither of us is hurt.

687
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:13,319
Then I walk to the yard
and my neighbor's dog

688
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,702
is just torn to fucking pieces.

689
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:22,344
Do you think Amy...
I'm...

690
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:25,414
Just last week, this guy
who I've never seen before

691
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:29,518
walks up to me in the middle of the
street and starts asking me about her.

692
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:30,886
Then he tells me
that I'm in danger.

693
01:11:30,918 --> 01:11:32,386
Who was it?

694
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:34,056
Who gives a shit, man?

695
01:11:34,088 --> 01:11:37,391
The point is that I'm
freaked the fuck out.

696
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:38,927
I can't even sleep at night.

697
01:11:40,528 --> 01:11:42,431
I don't wanna go home.

698
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:43,931
Are you fucking kidding me?

699
01:11:43,965 --> 01:11:45,500
I wish I was.

700
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:47,502
That's your big
fucking house, man.

701
01:11:47,534 --> 01:11:49,403
I know.

702
01:11:49,436 --> 01:11:51,439
Tell her to get the fuck out.

703
01:11:51,472 --> 01:11:53,341
-I can't, Mark.
-Why?

704
01:11:53,975 --> 01:11:56,712
Because I don't want to see her.

705
01:11:56,744 --> 01:11:58,413
She scares me.

706
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,485
Man, I told you not
to get involved!

707
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:06,387
Don't!

708
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,791
I don't need that
from you right now.

709
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,562
Sorry, you're right.

710
01:12:14,828 --> 01:12:16,997
Do you want me to talk to her?

711
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:18,699
-No.
-Why not?

712
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:20,534
I'll tell that little
bitch to pack her bags.

713
01:12:20,568 --> 01:12:22,371
Look I just need you to
be my friend right now.

714
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:30,512
Okay, I gotta get back to work.

715
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:37,852
You go to my place, get some sleep,
we'll figure this out later, okay?

716
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,988
You look like shit.

717
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,023
Thanks.

718
01:13:36,978 --> 01:13:38,512
Eddie's not home.

719
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:40,883
Yeah, I know.

720
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:17,945
Hello?

721
01:16:56,277 --> 01:16:57,746
Eddie, wake up.

722
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,681
Easy, easy, easy!

723
01:16:59,713 --> 01:17:01,416
Relax!

724
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:03,217
It was just a bad dream.

725
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:04,886
It's just a dream.

726
01:17:09,323 --> 01:17:12,628
-Thanks.
-You all right?

727
01:17:15,128 --> 01:17:16,965
Yeah, what time is it?

728
01:17:16,997 --> 01:17:20,734
It's about nine.
Why didn't you sleep in the bed?

729
01:17:20,768 --> 01:17:22,337
I don't wanna put you out.

730
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,810
You look like you
could use a beer.

731
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:42,724
You went and saw Amy,
didn't you?

732
01:17:48,762 --> 01:17:50,064
I asked you not to.

733
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,734
Sorry man, I couldn't
just stand by

734
01:17:53,768 --> 01:17:56,738
and watch some crazy bitch put my
best friend out of his own home.

735
01:18:00,841 --> 01:18:05,079
What did she say? She'll be
gone by the time you get back.

736
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,748
You can sleep here tonight.

737
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:14,421
I really need to see Astrid.

738
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:16,858
Not a good idea.

739
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:18,225
I feel terrible.

740
01:18:18,259 --> 01:18:19,493
How do you think I feel?

741
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:21,163
I introduced you to her.

742
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:29,003
Give it some time man.
You guys really freaked her out.

743
01:18:29,036 --> 01:18:30,939
I didn't do anything.

744
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:33,373
Give it some time anyway.

745
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:34,775
You wanna watch some tv?

746
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,814
I'm sorry, man.

747
01:18:39,947 --> 01:18:42,851
Get some sleep,
we'll figure this out later.

748
01:19:03,037 --> 01:19:05,874
Well, hello again, Mr. Marquez.

749
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,909
We didn't wake you, did we?

750
01:19:07,942 --> 01:19:09,511
What can I do for you?

751
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:11,779
Your cell is a 646
number, correct?

752
01:19:13,113 --> 01:19:15,115
Yeah, it's a New York line.

753
01:19:15,149 --> 01:19:17,753
Do you know an Astrid Flowers?

754
01:19:18,452 --> 01:19:19,954
Yeah, why?

755
01:19:19,987 --> 01:19:23,257
Exactly what is your
relationship with Ms. Flowers?

756
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,260
She's my friend.
Why?

757
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:26,860
Can you account
for your whereabouts

758
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:30,097
between the hours
of 7 and 10 PM last night?

759
01:19:30,131 --> 01:19:32,300
I was at my friend Mark's.

760
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:34,935
Mark, what was his last name?

761
01:19:34,969 --> 01:19:37,971
Mark Gaines. Can somebody please
tell me what's going on here?

762
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:41,943
Astrid Flowers was found raped and
murdered in her studio this morning.

763
01:19:44,845 --> 01:19:51,885
We're genuinely sorry to bring you
such terrible news like this.

764
01:19:51,918 --> 01:19:54,989
But when was the last
time you saw Ms. Flowers?

765
01:19:58,225 --> 01:20:00,327
Mr. Marquez?

766
01:20:01,962 --> 01:20:05,465
I'm sorry, I saw her
a couple days ago.

767
01:20:05,498 --> 01:20:07,467
She let us use her studio.

768
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:09,170
Us?

769
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:11,406
Yeah, me and my friend Amy.

770
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:12,440
Your girlfriend?

771
01:20:12,472 --> 01:20:14,175
She's not my girlfriend.

772
01:20:14,207 --> 01:20:15,876
But she lives with you?

773
01:20:15,909 --> 01:20:17,612
No, she doesn't
live here anymore.

774
01:20:17,645 --> 01:20:19,981
You guys break up?

775
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:22,317
Look, am I under suspicion
or something?

776
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:23,685
Why would you come to me?

777
01:20:23,717 --> 01:20:30,457
In cases like these, we can't
afford to leave any stone unturned.

778
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,961
Your number came up on a list
of calls to Miss Flowers.

779
01:20:33,994 --> 01:20:35,963
We're just checking
it out, Eddie.

780
01:20:36,997 --> 01:20:39,533
Standard procedure,
I assure you.

781
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:41,903
Thank you very much
for your time.

782
01:20:43,503 --> 01:20:48,943
You're not planning on traveling any
time soon, are you, Mr. Marquez?

783
01:20:48,975 --> 01:20:51,078
No, no.

784
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,480
Good.

785
01:20:52,512 --> 01:20:53,948
Have a nice day.

786
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:12,901
So what do you think?

787
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:14,903
I think that's our boy.

788
01:21:25,078 --> 01:21:26,313
<i>Hello.</i>

789
01:21:26,346 --> 01:21:28,015
Mark.

790
01:21:28,048 --> 01:21:30,083
Astrid's dead, dude.

791
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:32,387
The cops came by and
they think that I did it, man.

792
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,122
<i>Fooled you!</i>

793
01:21:34,154 --> 01:21:36,056
<i>Leave a message.</i>

794
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,960
<i>You're so gullible, I can't
believe you fell for that.</i>

795
01:21:38,993 --> 01:21:41,663
God damn it, Mark,
answer your God damn phone!

796
01:23:21,228 --> 01:23:23,198
Are you ready to hear me now?

797
01:23:50,623 --> 01:23:54,561
She's been looking
for you for a long time.

798
01:23:54,595 --> 01:23:56,364
For me?

799
01:23:56,396 --> 01:23:59,067
Someone like you.

800
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,769
Damaged.

801
01:24:05,706 --> 01:24:07,242
What do you know about me?

802
01:24:08,408 --> 01:24:11,112
It's a small town, Eddie.

803
01:24:11,145 --> 01:24:14,082
When one of its own
comes back after 20 years...

804
01:24:15,315 --> 01:24:18,385
and tries to kill himself,
people talk.

805
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,289
I know all about you.

806
01:24:23,157 --> 01:24:25,092
I know about your family.

807
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:28,096
And I know what your mother did.

808
01:24:28,128 --> 01:24:30,097
What does this have
to do with Amy?

809
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,333
Everything.

810
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:34,502
Are you gonna tell
me what's going on?

811
01:24:37,203 --> 01:24:41,175
Amy... is a conduit.

812
01:24:44,278 --> 01:24:45,445
A conduit?

813
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:51,185
A spiritual channel,
a gateway to a dark evil

814
01:24:51,217 --> 01:24:56,323
that exists only to
possess and destroy.

815
01:24:56,356 --> 01:24:57,557
I don't believe in that shit.

816
01:24:57,591 --> 01:24:59,393
Yes, you do.

817
01:24:59,426 --> 01:25:01,162
You've seen it.

818
01:25:01,194 --> 01:25:07,167
You felt it and that's why
you came looking for me.

819
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:09,136
What does this have
to do with me?

820
01:25:12,206 --> 01:25:18,311
I think it's a crack in your psyche,
that's what's attracted Amy to you.

821
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:21,182
She's drawing you in,
bonding with you.

822
01:25:22,615 --> 01:25:25,286
Intimately, carnally.

823
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:30,625
Trying to pass this thing off,
like a disease.

824
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:34,495
What thing?

825
01:25:34,528 --> 01:25:36,364
A demon.

826
01:25:38,332 --> 01:25:40,168
A demon?

827
01:25:42,269 --> 01:25:47,307
Amy grew up in a small
town not far from here.

828
01:25:47,341 --> 01:25:51,646
Her family, they were members
of the local congregation.

829
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,314
Good churchgoing people.

830
01:25:54,414 --> 01:25:57,719
Church is a big deal in these
small towns, isn't it, Eddie?

831
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:03,257
But she was different
from the other girls.

832
01:26:03,289 --> 01:26:07,228
Blossoming almost before
she was aware of it.

833
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:10,765
But the men, the men in town,
they were aware of it.

834
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:15,335
Including the parish priest.

835
01:26:16,436 --> 01:26:21,474
His faith was no match for the
lust that she inspired in him.

836
01:26:21,507 --> 01:26:23,644
He seduced her.

837
01:26:23,676 --> 01:26:28,315
The old fool,
he fell in love with her.

838
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:35,323
And Amy, she too soon fell in
love with one of the local boys.

839
01:26:37,557 --> 01:26:41,295
The priest, he was
insane with jealousy.

840
01:26:41,328 --> 01:26:43,431
He threatened to
tell Amy's parents.

841
01:26:43,463 --> 01:26:47,368
But Amy, she threatened
to expose the priest,

842
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:52,872
how he had seduced her, how they
had been carrying on for months.

843
01:26:52,905 --> 01:26:55,643
It would ruin him.

844
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:59,948
So the priest, he concocted
a truly wicked plan.

845
01:27:02,983 --> 01:27:06,820
He told Amy's parents
about her and the boy.

846
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:10,291
But he said that Amy was
not of her right mind.

847
01:27:10,323 --> 01:27:15,362
That she had been touched by
evil, that she was possessed.

848
01:27:16,663 --> 01:27:20,467
And the simpletons bought it.

849
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:22,936
And they agreed to an exorcism.

850
01:27:43,957 --> 01:27:46,294
Mommy.

851
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:48,596
Mommy, no more.

852
01:27:48,628 --> 01:27:50,331
Hush, baby.

853
01:27:50,363 --> 01:27:52,332
It will be over soon.

854
01:27:52,365 --> 01:27:55,469
Daddy?

855
01:27:55,502 --> 01:27:58,572
Silence, unclean spirit.

856
01:27:58,604 --> 01:28:04,077
You cannot fool us, for we have come
in the name of the one true God,

857
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:08,349
by whose authority we will cast you
out of this servant of the Lord.

858
01:28:08,381 --> 01:28:10,384
No, no more.

859
01:28:11,417 --> 01:28:16,056
Let us begin.
Christ have mercy.

860
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,925
-Stop it.
-Christ have mercy.

861
01:28:17,957 --> 01:28:20,927
-Stop it. There's nothing wrong with me.
-Christ hear us.

862
01:28:20,961 --> 01:28:22,697
Christ graciously hear us.

863
01:28:22,729 --> 01:28:25,432
God the father in heaven
Have mercy on us.

864
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,469
God, son, redeemer of the world.

865
01:28:28,502 --> 01:28:30,871
-It was him, it was him!
-Pray for us.

866
01:28:30,904 --> 01:28:34,442
-Holy orders of blessed spirits.
-Pray for us.

867
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,444
It was him.

868
01:28:36,476 --> 01:28:38,045
He fucked me.

869
01:28:38,078 --> 01:28:39,447
He did it to me.

870
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:41,081
He's the fucking devil.

871
01:28:41,114 --> 01:28:44,452
Silence, purveyor of lies!

872
01:28:44,484 --> 01:28:46,619
Hold your forked tongue.

873
01:28:46,653 --> 01:28:51,625
Do not attempt to sully the
sanctity of this most holy ceremony

874
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:54,362
with your vile blasphemies.

875
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:56,063
No, no, no, no!

876
01:28:56,095 --> 01:28:58,365
No! No!
She must be restrained.

877
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:02,470
No, please let me go!
No, no!

878
01:29:02,502 --> 01:29:05,139
-Pray for us!
-Saint Andrew.

879
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:07,140
-Let me go!
-Pray for us!

880
01:29:07,173 --> 01:29:09,542
-Saint James.
-Pray for us!

881
01:29:09,576 --> 01:29:12,613
-St. John.
-Pray for us!

882
01:29:12,645 --> 01:29:15,515
-Saint Thomas.
-Pray for us!

883
01:29:15,548 --> 01:29:16,917
Saint Phillip.

884
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:20,387
Saint Bartholomew.

885
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:23,423
Saint Matthew.

886
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:24,825
Saint Simon.

887
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:25,760
No.

888
01:29:25,792 --> 01:29:28,695
No!

889
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:14,575
And when it was over, the beautiful
and vibrant child was gone.

890
01:30:14,608 --> 01:30:19,012
And in her place, an angry and
brooding young woman.

891
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:23,016
Prone to terrible,
terrible fits of violence.

892
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:31,024
Then one by one, her family all started
dying under mysterious circumstances.

893
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,863
For years, Amy was tormented.

894
01:30:37,029 --> 01:30:41,534
And then she turned to drugs,
the harder the better.

895
01:30:41,568 --> 01:30:44,070
And it seemed to help.

896
01:30:44,104 --> 01:30:51,110
The demon didn't seem to be able
to take control amid all the fog.

897
01:30:51,144 --> 01:30:53,047
And then you came along.

898
01:30:57,184 --> 01:30:58,918
I was just trying to help her.

899
01:30:58,952 --> 01:31:02,923
And in return,
she's trying to destroy you.

900
01:31:04,957 --> 01:31:09,829
Well, if what you're saying is
true, I have to go and find her.

901
01:31:09,863 --> 01:31:13,167
No, Eddie. What you need
to do is put as much

902
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,668
distance as you can
between you and Amy.

903
01:31:15,702 --> 01:31:16,536
Look.

904
01:31:16,569 --> 01:31:18,171
They think I killed
Astrid Flowers.

905
01:31:18,204 --> 01:31:19,640
I can't run now.

906
01:31:19,672 --> 01:31:21,608
I have to go find Amy and
prove my innocence.

907
01:31:21,641 --> 01:31:23,911
Eddie, nothing can
be gained from this.

908
01:31:23,944 --> 01:31:25,813
It may already be
too late for you.

909
01:31:25,845 --> 01:31:27,747
Look, more reason for
me to go and find her.

910
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,250
Get out of my way.

911
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:32,787
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

912
01:31:42,863 --> 01:31:46,767
Check it out.
Merry fucking Christmas.

913
01:31:54,908 --> 01:31:56,243
Eddie Marquez,
you're under arrest.

914
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:57,310
For what?

915
01:31:57,344 --> 01:31:59,846
For the murder of Astrid
Flowers and Mark Gaines.

916
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:00,948
No, I didn't do it.

917
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:02,349
Okay, then you've got
nothing to worry about, son.

918
01:32:02,382 --> 01:32:05,051
Put your hands on the back of your
head and get down on the ground.

919
01:32:05,085 --> 01:32:06,753
I'm unarmed.
You can't shoot me.

920
01:32:06,787 --> 01:32:08,789
God damnit.

921
01:32:39,886 --> 01:32:41,789
You got nowhere to go, Eddie.

922
01:33:14,787 --> 01:33:18,125
Who's there?
Show yourself.

923
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:20,261
I will shoot you.

924
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,737
Eddie?

925
01:34:03,302 --> 01:34:06,006
Eddie, is that you?

926
01:34:21,954 --> 01:34:24,225
Amy, where are you?

927
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:32,932
I know you're in here.

928
01:34:32,966 --> 01:34:35,036
Come out, god dammit!

929
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:08,836
Dear God.

930
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:34,862
Dave!

931
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,016
What the fuck?

932
01:37:26,139 --> 01:37:27,908
Amy!

933
01:37:35,381 --> 01:37:37,317
What do you want?

934
01:37:38,217 --> 01:37:39,953
What have you done?

935
01:37:43,456 --> 01:37:45,626
Whatever do you mean?

936
01:37:47,193 --> 01:37:49,128
What have you done to me?

937
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:52,900
You know better than
to sleep around.

938
01:37:52,932 --> 01:37:55,536
What, did you catch something?

939
01:37:57,671 --> 01:38:00,207
Why, Amy?
I tried to help you.

940
01:38:02,007 --> 01:38:06,380
Because the mess your mommy left
inside your head made it really easy.

941
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:11,218
I've dealt with this
shit for a long time.

942
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:12,686
Now it's your problem.

943
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,320
Congratulations.

944
01:38:14,354 --> 01:38:16,891
You bitch!

945
01:38:18,057 --> 01:38:20,460
I've been called worse.

946
01:38:20,493 --> 01:38:22,162
Bye, now.

947
01:38:34,006 --> 01:38:36,108
What did you do
to my best friend?

948
01:38:36,141 --> 01:38:37,677
Are you kidding me?

949
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:40,547
What did you do?!

950
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:46,420
-I didn't lay a finger on him.
-Liar!

951
01:38:49,088 --> 01:38:52,326
I swear, I didn't touch him.

952
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:55,629
They're going to think
I killed them all!

953
01:38:55,662 --> 01:38:58,164
What about that
little girl?

954
01:38:58,198 --> 01:39:03,570
The two cops that followed you in,
haven't heard from them in a while.

955
01:39:03,603 --> 01:39:05,972
What the fuck are you?

956
01:39:07,006 --> 01:39:09,009
What the fuck are you?

957
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:29,061
For 15 years I've tried
to make it right, Eddie!

958
01:39:29,095 --> 01:39:31,131
I've tried to protect her.

959
01:39:31,163 --> 01:39:34,033
I've tried to protect
the world from her.

960
01:39:34,067 --> 01:39:37,270
What I did was wrong, Eddie,
I can't undo that.

961
01:39:37,302 --> 01:39:42,242
But if you kill me, the blood
will bind you together.

962
01:39:42,274 --> 01:39:43,978
You'll never be free.

963
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:47,114
He is bound.

964
01:39:48,715 --> 01:39:51,184
It was you.

965
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:55,154
No, Eddie, dear God.
