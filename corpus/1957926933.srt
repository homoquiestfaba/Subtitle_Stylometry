00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:29,583
Hi.

186
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:34,888
Hey, Luce.

187
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:39,793
Don't touch her.
Her skin hurts.

It's okay.

SYLVIE: It's okay.
Go ahead.

190
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,636
Except you're going to make me cry.

191
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:50,737
She doesn't want to cry,

192
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:53,073
because she's the "W" word now.

193
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,041
God, great jacket.

194
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,176
Is it new?

195
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:58,011
Yeah. I just got it at Charivari.
Fabulous.

196
00:11:58,078 --> 00:11:59,412
It was on sale.

197
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,648
They also had it in smoky brown.

198
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:02,849
That would look great on you.

199
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,351
I definitely love the black.
You think so?

200
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:07,587
I can't believe that we're
talking about your jacket.

201
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,356
I know.

202
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:12,726
I can't believe I had to
add the Charivari part.

203
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:14,861
(VOICE SHAKING)
I'm so sorry, Becky.

204
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:16,930
I can't believe this happened.

205
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,300
Did you talk to Dad?

206
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:23,036
Yeah. Before he got on the plane.

207
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:24,638
What did he say?

208
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:26,673
Did he talk about Mom?

209
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,375
I mean, what did he say,

210
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:29,809
about, you know, when Mom died?

211
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:32,879
Did he feel it right away?

212
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,685
God, you went to Zabar's?

213
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:39,786
What did you get?

214
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:41,354
I have no idea what's in there.

215
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:42,789

216
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:44,891
so... Food. (CHUCKLES)

Would one of you make her a cup of tea?

We make tea.

We're jointly making tea.

00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:14,881
I'm starving.

243
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:17,550
I haven't eaten anything
since dinner last night,

244
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:18,885
which I basically cried through

245
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:20,653
because my husband and I
are probably breaking up.

246
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,990
And, you know, I asked Rebecca if she
wanted tea, or food, or something.

She said no.

We don't have things to
buzz with here, Alberta,

to ask what Becky wanted to eat.

want to make choices now.

going to get me while I sleep.

The painter.

734
00:42:06,184 --> 00:42:09,254
Valentino. Don't you just
know he loves beautiful women,

735
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,089
and their spirits live in his paintbrushes.

736
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:14,859
He paints them on all the
corner walls in big houses

737
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:15,927
and little houses,

738
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,763

743

ruins people's lives.

Yes. But if he were to
fall for someone who was,

you know, new to relationships,

747
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,315
then he could teach her stuff, you know?

748
00:42:37,382 --> 00:42:39,384

01:07:09,786 --> 01:07:11,755
I'm a jerk.
I'm an asshole.

1259
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:13,957
No. I'm completely self-absorbed.

1260
01:07:14,024 --> 01:07:15,292
Yes, you are. But

1261
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:16,326
it's understandable.

1262
01:07:16,393 --> 01:07:17,160
It's okay for you too.

1263
01:07:17,227 --> 01:07:19,262
All right.
All right. Enough.

Yeah.

01:07:26,336 --> 01:07:27,837
Cool.

1269
01:07:27,904 --> 01:07:29,873
So, tell me. How come we're not married?

1270

'Cause I still think it's
a bit too soon for me.

me and Paul's best day.

I wish you could jump into Paul's body.

1277

Except during sex when I want Paul
to jump into that painter's body.

1278
01:07:48,525 --> 01:07:51,127
And I'd be left with
that Tompkins' porch feeling

1279
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:53,163

Well, secretly,
they'd like to be invisible.

They hate their bodies,

and their mothers,

01:10:20,143 --> 01:10:21,911

and their lives.

But, they don't want you to know that,

The best thing about it is you get
the grease to run down your hands.

You grab it with both hands,

1367

you stuff it in your mouth.

1477

do that breathing thing?

01:27:30,406 --> 01:27:33,275
and she didn't show up today, either.

1616
01:27:33,342 --> 01:27:35,411
I just thought you should know.

1617
01:27:36,478 --> 01:27:37,513
Anyway,

1618
01:27:38,147 --> 01:27:40,315
hope to see you tonight.

1619
01:27:40,883 --> 01:27:42,818
I really can't wait.

1620
01:27:43,652 --> 01:27:45,287
(PHONE RINGING)

1621
01:27:45,354 --> 01:27:47,389

1622
01:27:54,029 --> 01:27:56,131
(PHONE RINGING)

1623
01:29:07,336 --> 01:29:08,637
Did you get ahold of Sylvie?

1624
01:29:08,704 --> 01:29:10,072
She went right over.

1625
01:29:10,138 --> 01:29:11,473
What happened?

1626
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:12,541
I don't know.

1627
01:29:18,514 --> 01:29:21,216
SYLVIE:<i> I can't get you
something to drink like water?</i>

1628
01:29:21,283 --> 01:29:24,453
<i>and I, uh, can't make the bed for you.</i>

1629
01:29:25,554 --> 01:29:28,323
Are we back in the Georgia O'Keeffe thing?

1630
01:29:29,124 --> 01:29:30,526
Okay. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

1631
01:29:32,227 --> 01:29:33,495
What brought this on?

1632
01:29:35,564 --> 01:29:37,499
She slept with the painter.

1633
01:29:38,267 --> 01:29:39,501
You did?

1634
01:29:40,369 --> 01:29:41,570
(VOICE SHAKING) Oh, shit.

1635
01:29:42,404 --> 01:29:46,074
(SOBBING) I can't.
I can't hold this in any more.

1636
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:49,244
I can't. I just can't.
God damn it!

1637
01:29:50,746 --> 01:29:52,381
(SOBBING)

1638
01:29:53,148 --> 01:29:56,084
I've been holding this in for so long.

1639
01:29:56,151 --> 01:29:58,320
Like it was my virginity or something.

1640
01:29:58,387 --> 01:30:01,290
You know, after it was over, I could never

1641
01:30:01,356 --> 01:30:03,492
not know again.

1642
01:30:03,759 --> 01:30:05,961
Not know what?

1643
01:30:06,595 --> 01:30:08,096
(SPUTTERING)

1644
01:30:08,163 --> 01:30:09,531
(SOBBING) The last time I saw Ben,

1645
01:30:09,598 --> 01:30:11,967
we had this really huge fight.

1646
01:30:12,034 --> 01:30:14,403
We had this fight because...

1647
01:30:17,339 --> 01:30:19,007
I didn't... I...

1648
01:30:19,074 --> 01:30:21,410
Didn't wanna have a baby.

1649
01:30:23,512 --> 01:30:25,647
You both didn't wanna have a baby?

1650
01:30:25,714 --> 01:30:26,982
No. It was me, okay?

1651
01:30:27,049 --> 01:30:28,450
He wanted to for years.

1652
01:30:28,517 --> 01:30:31,119
I was the asshole who kept saying no.

1653
01:30:31,186 --> 01:30:32,487
And I keep thinking, you know,

1654
01:30:32,554 --> 01:30:33,922
what if he had this inner time clock

1655
01:30:33,989 --> 01:30:35,958
that was just ticking
faster than other people's?

1656
01:30:36,024 --> 01:30:38,260
(HYSTERICALLY) What if he knew
that he was never gonna get old?

1657
01:30:38,327 --> 01:30:42,064
(SHOUTING) What if he just wanted to
leave this little part of himself behind

1658
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:44,066
and I was the one who said no?

1659
01:30:44,132 --> 01:30:45,400
ALBERTA: Why didn't you want a baby?

1660
01:30:45,467 --> 01:30:47,002
(SHOUTS) Because I was mean!

1661
01:30:47,069 --> 01:30:49,271
Because he always got
everything he ever wanted.

1662
01:30:49,338 --> 01:30:51,139
He wanted this house, so we lived here.

1663
01:30:51,206 --> 01:30:52,474
He wanted to teach at that university,

1664
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:53,842
so that's where I went.

1665
01:30:53,909 --> 01:30:56,578
Because, he was the goddamn
center of everything.

1666
01:30:56,645 --> 01:30:57,579
Including me.

1667
01:30:57,646 --> 01:30:59,214
And it was a well-known fact

1668
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:02,651
that he was gonna be the greatest
goddamn father that ever lived.

1669
01:31:03,685 --> 01:31:05,087
And that I

1670
01:31:05,153 --> 01:31:08,690
was gonna be the worst mother.

1671
01:31:09,358 --> 01:31:10,759
LUCY: That is not true.

1672
01:31:10,826 --> 01:31:12,527
Look at me!

1673
01:31:12,594 --> 01:31:15,330
Everything always has
to be just so, with me,

1674
01:31:15,397 --> 01:31:16,431
doesn't it?

1675
01:31:16,498 --> 01:31:17,866
God! I'm not even good with dogs!

1676
01:31:17,933 --> 01:31:20,168
Can you imagine the kind
of mother that I would be?

1677
01:31:20,235 --> 01:31:21,436
(CRYING) You would've been a great mother!

1678
01:31:21,503 --> 01:31:22,571
REBECCA: (SOBBING) No, I wouldn't.

1679
01:31:22,638 --> 01:31:24,172
You took really good care of me

1680
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,240
after Mom died.

1681
01:31:25,307 --> 01:31:26,208
Lucy!

1682
01:31:26,274 --> 01:31:28,310
I would've made so many mistakes

1683
01:31:28,377 --> 01:31:29,311
with that little baby,

1684
01:31:29,378 --> 01:31:31,446
it would only have loved Ben.

1685
01:31:31,513 --> 01:31:34,549
(HYSTERICALLY)
it would only have loved Ben.

1686
01:31:36,318 --> 01:31:37,619
So, I didn't

1687
01:31:38,754 --> 01:31:40,288
have it.

1688
01:31:42,924 --> 01:31:45,494
(SOBBING) And now they both hate me.

1689
01:31:46,328 --> 01:31:47,663
ALBERTA: Who?

1690
01:31:47,729 --> 01:31:48,530
(SHOUTS) Ben!

1691
01:31:48,597 --> 01:31:50,632
Ben and his stupid goddamn baby

1692
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:52,567
that I'm never gonna have.

1693
01:31:52,634 --> 01:31:54,369
(SORROWFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

1694
01:31:56,138 --> 01:31:57,539
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

1695
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,517
(SPUTTERING) I just don't wanna let go.

1696
01:32:09,851 --> 01:32:12,521
I just don't want...

1697
01:32:16,692 --> 01:32:20,328
(HYSTERICALLY) Oh, God!
I don't wanna let go.

1698

(SOBBING)

1699
01:32:41,049 --> 01:32:43,752
SYLVIE: I think we should go
somewhere really special.

1700
01:32:45,387 --> 01:32:48,390
REBECCA: If you think I'm
doing Tompkins' porch tonight,

1701
01:32:48,457 --> 01:32:49,691
you're wrong.

1702
01:32:50,025 --> 01:32:52,360
I mean, all of us.

1703
01:32:54,362 --> 01:32:55,797
We should go and

1704
01:32:57,466 --> 01:32:58,767
let go.

1705
01:33:07,609 --> 01:33:09,177
ALBERTA: Isn't this fun?

1706
01:33:09,244 --> 01:33:11,613
You know, I've read about men's
groups doing this kind of thing,

1707
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,215
and I've always hated to be excluded.

1708
01:33:13,281 --> 01:33:15,584
LUCY: Sylvie,
I don't understand what we're doing here

1709
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:16,618
at 5:00 in the morning.

1710
01:33:16,685 --> 01:33:18,153
ALBERTA: Oh, this is like

1711
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,521
wilderness bonding,

1712
01:33:19,588 --> 01:33:21,156
or Outward Bound.

1713
01:33:21,223 --> 01:33:22,424
When a group of people come together

1714
01:33:22,491 --> 01:33:24,392
and they get to know
each other really well.

1715
01:33:24,459 --> 01:33:26,261
Only, you can't force this sort of thing.

1716
01:33:26,328 --> 01:33:27,796
It has to happen naturally.

1717
01:33:28,797 --> 01:33:30,632
What are you talking about?

1718
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:32,434
SYLVIE: Come on, now. You ready?

1719
01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:33,769
Come on. Come on.

1720
01:33:34,603 --> 01:33:37,439
Okay. Let's make a circle.

1721
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,676
Just breathe deep, and...

1722
01:33:41,743 --> 01:33:43,712
And we'll say why we're here.

1723
01:33:43,779 --> 01:33:45,380
Each of us, individually.

1724
01:33:45,447 --> 01:33:46,782
Okay? I'll start.

1725
01:33:46,982 --> 01:33:48,483
Okay.

1726
01:33:48,884 --> 01:33:50,452
I'm here

1727
01:33:50,519 --> 01:33:53,488
first, to say thank you to some

1728
01:33:53,555 --> 01:33:55,257
pretty great women.

1729
01:33:55,457 --> 01:33:56,658
Yeah.

1730
01:33:57,459 --> 01:34:00,228
And to ask them to

1731
01:34:00,295 --> 01:34:02,464
give me the strength to stay on the path

1732
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:04,499
I seem to have chosen.

1733
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:07,202
I don't know if I can do it,

1734
01:34:07,602 --> 01:34:10,505
but I'd like to try.

1735
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,775
So, thank you.

1736
01:34:16,978 --> 01:34:18,480
Alberta.

1737
01:34:19,514 --> 01:34:20,615
Uh, I'm here...

1738
01:34:20,682 --> 01:34:22,217
You're here to say hello to someone

1739
01:34:22,284 --> 01:34:23,618
who you've never met.

1740
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:27,756
Oh, no. Not now.
Oh, yes. Now.

1741
01:34:27,823 --> 01:34:29,324
This is the perfect time.

1742
01:34:29,391 --> 01:34:30,759
This is the only time, Alberta.

1743
01:34:30,826 --> 01:34:32,527
Say hello to my mother.

1744
01:34:37,432 --> 01:34:38,633
Say it.

1745
01:34:42,904 --> 01:34:43,939
All right.

1746
01:34:44,973 --> 01:34:46,241
Hello.

1747
01:34:47,042 --> 01:34:48,510
Say her name.

1748
01:34:48,577 --> 01:34:50,512
Say Joanna, please.

1749
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:55,951
Hello, Joanna.

1750
01:34:57,619 --> 01:34:59,554
Ask her how she's doing.

1751
01:35:02,157 --> 01:35:05,060
Your daughter wants to know
how you're doing, Joanna.

1752
01:35:05,126 --> 01:35:06,795
LUCY: And please tell her that I miss her

1753
01:35:06,862 --> 01:35:08,630
and that I love her very much.

1754
01:35:08,697 --> 01:35:09,664
Stop it, Lucy.

1755
01:35:09,731 --> 01:35:10,999
You're being cruel.

1756
01:35:11,066 --> 01:35:13,001
You know what?
If Alberta wants me so badly,

1757
01:35:13,068 --> 01:35:14,569
she has to do this.

1758
01:35:24,045 --> 01:35:25,313
Joanna,

1759
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:27,782
your daughter Lucy misses you

1760
01:35:28,049 --> 01:35:29,584
very much

1761
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,888
and loves you very much.

1762
01:35:32,954 --> 01:35:35,824
I know, because every
time I reach out to her,

1763
01:35:35,891 --> 01:35:38,727
it only makes her miss you more.

1764
01:35:39,361 --> 01:35:41,763
I envy you, Joanna.

1765
01:35:42,831 --> 01:35:44,966
It would be such an honor

1766
01:35:45,033 --> 01:35:46,368
if she would let me

1767
01:35:46,434 --> 01:35:48,837
complete the job you started.

1768
01:35:49,804 --> 01:35:51,706
I would do anything

1769
01:35:52,073 --> 01:35:53,575
for that honor.

1770
01:35:54,943 --> 01:35:55,944
Even this.

1771
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,948
You don't have to say anymore.

1772
01:36:02,384 --> 01:36:04,319
ALBERTA: I need your help, Joanna.

1773
01:36:06,454 --> 01:36:07,355
I need

1774
01:36:07,422 --> 01:36:09,758
your help to open a door to Lucy,

1775
01:36:10,825 --> 01:36:12,560
Tell me what words you use

1776
01:36:12,627 --> 01:36:14,796
to chase away her nightmares.

1777
01:36:16,131 --> 01:36:16,898
Or how you

1778
01:36:16,965 --> 01:36:19,968
held her so she didn't squirm away.

1779
01:36:20,669 --> 01:36:21,736
Whisper to me

1780
01:36:21,803 --> 01:36:23,972
the secrets of your motherhood.

1781
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,744
(VOICE SHAKING) I can't hear you, Joanna.

1782
01:36:32,414 --> 01:36:33,548
You can stop.

1783
01:36:33,615 --> 01:36:35,850
What are the secrets of motherhood, Sylvie?

1784
01:36:37,686 --> 01:36:39,988
Do you have to give birth to know them?

1785
01:36:41,456 --> 01:36:43,792
No. It just takes practice.

1786
01:36:44,426 --> 01:36:45,560
You're doin' fine.

1787
01:36:45,627 --> 01:36:47,028

1789
01:36:54,102 --> 01:36:55,603
SYLVIE: Lucy?

1790
01:37:40,882 --> 01:37:43,585
When I was younger,

1791
01:37:43,651 --> 01:37:45,020
I used to have

1792
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:47,422
this list that I had made

1793
01:37:47,489 --> 01:37:50,425
describing my perfect man.

1794
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,728
He had to have

1795
01:37:54,763 --> 01:37:57,732
humor, wisdom,

1796
01:37:58,266 --> 01:37:59,734
compassion

1797
01:38:03,204 --> 01:38:05,740
and beautiful hands.

1798
01:38:08,643 --> 01:38:09,978
Like Ben.

1799
01:38:11,846 --> 01:38:14,682
(VOICE SHAKING)
I really loved my husband, you guys.

1800
01:38:14,983 --> 01:38:17,152
He was everything to me.

1801
01:38:18,787 --> 01:38:20,889
And it all got

1802
01:38:21,156 --> 01:38:21,990
ripped away.

1803
01:38:22,057 --> 01:38:25,827
Ripped apart at this one moment.

1804
01:38:25,894 --> 01:38:28,029
And suddenly I was alone.

1805
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:31,966
I don't know.

1806
01:38:32,033 --> 01:38:34,469
Maybe that's why I held on

1807
01:38:34,536 --> 01:38:36,237
with this grip so tight,

1808
01:38:36,304 --> 01:38:37,605
because if I let go,

1809
01:38:37,672 --> 01:38:40,041
(CRYING) he would be gone forever.

1810
01:38:42,110 --> 01:38:43,111
(CRYING)

1811
01:38:48,783 --> 01:38:50,085
But, he is gone.

1812
01:38:53,655 --> 01:38:54,856
Forever.

1813
01:38:57,225 --> 01:38:58,927
And it's okay,

1814
01:38:58,993 --> 01:39:00,795
because I loved him.

1815
01:39:01,729 --> 01:39:04,799
Because he knew that I loved him.

1816
01:39:07,001 --> 01:39:09,737
And that's all there really is.

1817
01:39:13,141 --> 01:39:15,944
And I guess what I have to say

1818
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:17,812
is really simple.

1819
01:39:22,917 --> 01:39:24,786
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

1820
01:39:25,019 --> 01:39:26,020
Ben,

1821
01:39:28,389 --> 01:39:30,825
with all of my heart

1822
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:35,196
and with everything that I am,

1823
01:39:38,366 --> 01:39:40,135
my love,

1824
01:39:43,204 --> 01:39:44,005
goodbye.
