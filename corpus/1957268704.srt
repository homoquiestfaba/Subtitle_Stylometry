624
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:12,159
I can only imagine
how you felt as a child,

when your parents weren't
looking after you.

626

that they ate.

635

They were taken care of.

636
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:51,154
They didn't ask
any questions.

637
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,722
They had to know where
the money was coming from.

638

They did nothing to stop me.

639

know about this?

No.

No, he would never
have married me.

644

wouldn't play for Nick.

645

Sam appeals to me.

654

if Nick still loves me.

I won't let this
ruin my life again.

it's too late, do you?

No, Laura,

658
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:02,835

up to your left hand.

00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:09,734
He told me how much
he misses me.

739
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:10,952
Oh, so romantic.

740
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:14,129
Wanted to take me
back to the club,

741
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,131
like the night we met.

742
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:18,830
When he brought me
up to the stage and sang to me.

743
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:22,572
I don't remember you
telling me that.

744
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,139
No, you told me

745
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,098
you met him at the bar,

746
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:27,621
after his set.

747
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:28,840
You sent him a drink.

748
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,059
Uh, no, well, we had drinks,

749
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,757
of course we did,
but that was later,

750
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:34,759
that was after
he sang to me.

751
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:35,890
Sounds lovely.

752
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:37,500
Mm...

753
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:42,592
I doubt that is something
I would forget.

754
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:43,681
That first night,

755
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:45,204
from the first instant,

756
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:48,860
we were like a shooting star,

757
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,037
but now it's time
to get back to real life.

758
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:54,126
It's good you see things
so clearly.

759
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:58,130
I always know
when it's time to walk away.

760
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,133
How do you know that?

761
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:03,352
Well, um...

762
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:05,877
Guys have always had
this thing for me.

763
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:07,792
It's been like that
all my life,

764
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:10,316
then they get, um,

765
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:11,709
they get a little too crazy.

766
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,711
They become obsessive...

767
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:18,237
And when I can't make them
understand

768
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:21,501
the reality
of what we really are,

769
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,590
I have to go.

770
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,984
That must be very difficult.

771
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:27,768
It is. It's...

772
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:30,118
It's so frightening

773
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:34,166
I have to disappear
so they can't find me.

774
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:36,472
It's happened
more than once,

775
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:39,606
but that's not
what's happening now.

776
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,739
Now my life is perfect.

777
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:44,480
Listen, um,

778
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:48,223
I appreciate
everything you've done,

779
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:49,921
but I won't be coming back.

780
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:53,054
No, now that my life
is straightening out,

781
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:55,100
I don't see the point.

782
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,276
Laura, it's...

783
00:45:57,406 --> 00:45:59,452
It's never this simple.

784
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:02,890
I'm sorry, uh,
in my case, it is.

785
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:04,892
No, no,
I-I don't think so.

786
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:06,067
There are things
that you've told me

787
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:08,156
that have me
very concerned.

788
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:11,290
The way you deal with
your relationships.

789
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,119
Your recollections differ
from one session to the next.

790
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:15,163
No...

791
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:17,078
No, I maybe carried on.

792
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:19,602
I-I exaggerate a little,

793
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,517
but I'm fine.

794
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:22,954
I'm really fine.

795
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:25,043
Laura, i-I'm not
comfortable with...

796
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:26,566
It's okay.

797

I am.

798
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:33,399
Well, at least
keep in touch

799
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:34,922
so I'll know how you're doing.

800
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:38,578
That won't be necessary.

801
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:47,761

802
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,822
Here.

803
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:49,823
Hey.

804
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:50,868
Hey, what do you
think, Lou?

805
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:51,781
I want to do
something special

806
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,261
for the holiday.

807
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:54,959
You know,
it's been a rough year,

808
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:55,742
for everybody.

809
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,875
How can you beat Turkey?

810
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:00,094
Well, Turkey's
pretty ordinary.

811
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:02,401
I was thinking more like duck.

812
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:03,184
What do you think about duck?

813
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,185
For 16?

814
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:05,708
For 12.

815
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,885
Well, you're going to
want to get 'em small,

816
00:48:08,015 --> 00:48:10,104
they're more tender that way,

817
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:12,106
and figure on
half a pound a person,

818
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:14,065
so... two three-pounders
oughta do it.

819
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:16,328
That sounds good,

820
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,025
and they'll look fabulous
on my table.

821
00:48:18,156 --> 00:48:20,767
And don't even bother about
makin' sauce.

822
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,857
We've got orange, sour cherry,
they're all homemade.

It's going to be perfect.

A perfect family dinner.

827
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:35,390
There's a gentleman
here to see you.

828
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:36,783
Thank you.

829
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:40,830
Hi, detective Mcauliffe.

Seattle pd.

831
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:45,313
Do you know this woman?

832
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:48,273
I think I took
a yoga class with her.

833
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:50,101
When was that?

834
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:51,276
A few days ago.

835
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:53,974
Um, Wednesday, I think.

836
00:48:54,105 --> 00:48:55,019
She died
on Wednesday.

837
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:56,281
She died?

838
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:58,022
We found her
at the yoga studio,

839
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,240
in the elevator.

840
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:01,199
She was, uh, she was hanged.

841
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:03,157
Oh, my god...

842
00:49:03,288 --> 00:49:04,506
We're just
talking to everyone

843
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:07,422
who signed in for
that last class.

844
00:49:07,553 --> 00:49:09,120
Well, I don't know
what I can tell you.

845
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,297
Um, it was a regular class,
nothing out of the ordinary.

846
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:13,515
Well, could you tell me

847
00:49:13,646 --> 00:49:15,648
who was at the studio
when you left?

848
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:17,128
I-I didn't really
pay attention.

849
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:19,173
I-I changed my clothes
and I left.

your description

was one of
the last people there.

853
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:28,443
It's possible, I guess.

854
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:30,489
Well, do you, uh,

855
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:31,925
do you remember
if the victim was still there?

856
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:33,057
I...

857
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:34,797
You know, I saw her
packing up.

858
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:37,975
Was she alone?

859
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:39,237
I don't know.

860

I'm actually embarrassed
to tell you

what I was really thinking

864

about something so horrific.

Well, please, indulge me.

the holidays
are coming up,

868
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:57,298

pay any attention

Will the sellers take
a 15-day escrow?

00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,240

00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:51,238
We need to be alone for this.

920
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:52,587
Okay, can you
put together

921
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:54,067
a package for Paris?

922
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:55,982
A romantic week for two.

923
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,375
This is just what we need
right now.

924
00:51:57,505 --> 00:51:59,072
Absolutely.

925
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:00,073
I will have a couple options
drawn up for you tomorrow.

926
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,206
Thank you, Linda.

927
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:05,034
I am going to sweep Nick
off his feet.

928
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,390
Patient presented
as an ordinary uptown woman

929
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,088
with a boring marriage
and an exciting affair...

930
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,786
But, lately, her behavior

931
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:21,660
is becoming more and more
inappropriate.

932
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,924
While she does not present
as a traditional depressive,

933
00:52:25,054 --> 00:52:26,969
more often than not,
her affect is flat

934
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,842
and dispassionate,

935
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:32,323
yet her descriptions of Sam,
subject of affair,

936
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:35,282
are embellished and idealized.

937
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:36,675
Her descriptions
of their first meeting

938
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:39,982
change with each telling.

939
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:41,723
I'm becoming very concerned

940
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:48,252
that this whole relationship
exists only in her mind.

941
00:52:53,387 --> 00:52:55,563
Laura...

942
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:56,825
Charlie Willacker.

943
00:52:56,956 --> 00:52:58,131
We're going to talk.

944
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:58,784
No, I've got to
get to a meeting.

945
00:52:58,914 --> 00:52:59,872
No.

946
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:01,352
No, now.

947
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:03,441
No more ducking me.

948
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:06,313
My life has been a train wreck
since you passed through it.

949
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:07,575
Oh.

950
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:10,230
I thought you'd been doing well.

951
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:13,233
I-I see you're doing stories
on the network news now.

952
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:14,191
See?

953
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:15,670
I still follow your career,

954
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:17,063
even though we stopped
seeing each other.

955
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,978
We didn't
see each other, Laura!

956
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:20,545
Well, let's not get into
that argument again...

957
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:23,591
My wife believed that crap
about us having an affair.

958
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:24,940
Maybe because it was true.

959
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:27,378
We didn't, Laura!

960
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:28,901
It was all
in that head of yours!

961
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,772
There might have been
two people in your fantasy,

962
00:53:30,903 --> 00:53:32,078
but there was only
one of us involved

963
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,732
here on planet earth.

964
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:36,125
I don't know why you feel
you need to deny what we had.

965
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:37,736
You are going to fix
what you destroyed.

966
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:39,477
You're going to convince Alix

967
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:40,695
that there was nothing
between us.

968
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:42,654
You are hurting me.

969
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:44,438
I have nothing more to lose.

970
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:50,227
I'm sorry.

971
00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:52,141
I didn't know you were so hurt.

972
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:55,362
Come with me to see her
to tell her the truth.

973
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:58,365
Yeah, I will...
You know what,

974
00:53:58,496 --> 00:53:59,366
I just have to get
to a meeting,

975
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:00,367
and I can't be late.

976
00:54:00,498 --> 00:54:01,542
I'll wait.

977
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:02,587
No, it'll be hours.

978
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:03,675
I'll meet you there.

979
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:05,198
I don't trust you.

980
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:06,634
Well, you're going
to have to

981
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:09,724
if you want me
to go along with this.

982
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:11,639
All right, I'll meet you
back here at 5:00.

983
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:17,123
Don't mess with me, Laura!

984
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:21,040
I know where
to find you now!

985
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:35,097
[Cell phone ringing]

986
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,666
Hello?

987
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:41,321
You wouldn't have gotten
that taxi anyway.

988
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:42,714
The lady with
the plaid pants

989
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:45,064
would have wrestled you
to the ground for it.

990
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:46,718
Sam?

991
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:48,241
Where are you?

992
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:49,286
I don't have to
be there

993
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,591
to know where you are,

994
00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:52,463
what you do.

995
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:53,812
[Chuckles] Okay...

996
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:57,032
Now you're scaring me.

997
00:54:57,163 --> 00:54:59,557
You know you can't
keep secrets from me.

998
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:02,342
What is it you think you know?

999
00:55:02,473 --> 00:55:04,083
I know you miss me.

1000
00:55:04,213 --> 00:55:06,085
[Chuckles]

1001
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:07,739
Wrong.

1002
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:10,568
I know you miss
what we had.

1003
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:12,091
Wrong again.

1004
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:16,225
And you've got
the best legs in town.

1005
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:17,923
I'm digging
the trench.

1006
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:21,143
Okay, where are you?

1007
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:25,800
Right here.

1008
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:28,150
Right in front
of you,

1009
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:31,284
right where I always am.

1010
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:35,767
What do you think you're doing?

1011
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:37,508
Kidnapping you.

1012
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:38,422
I don't have time
to be kidnapped.

1013
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:39,597
One hour.

1014
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:40,598
I want to take you somewhere.

1015
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:41,860
I want to show you

1016
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,557
that I wasn't
a complete bastard.

1017
00:55:46,255 --> 00:55:48,170
One hour.

1018
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:55,656
Where to?

1019
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:58,616
Pioneer square.
King street.

1020
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:18,418
For once, you're
speechless?

1021
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:24,729
She's beautiful.

1022
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,429
I don't know
what to say.

1023
00:56:35,304 --> 00:56:39,308
I really miss you.

1024
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:45,489
Come on.

1025
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:01,853
Ah...

1026
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:04,508
Oh, oh...My gosh.

1027
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:05,204
[Chuckles]

1028
00:57:06,597 --> 00:57:08,250
Mm.

1029
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,513
[Groaning in delight]

1030
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:10,209
Oh, this is completely
out of bounds.

1031
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:14,822
Well, you're irresistible.

1032
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:18,609
I'm glad one of us has
a little self-control.

1033
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:19,523
[Chuckles]

1034
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:24,702
So, how are things at home?

1035
00:57:24,832 --> 00:57:27,487
Just all right.

1036
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:30,359
That sounds promising.

1037
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,100
Tell me you miss me a little.

1038
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,667
I miss you,

1039
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:35,408
a little.

1040
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,716
[Giggles]

1041
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:40,457
[Chatting]

1042
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:41,893
Oh, my god,
there's Nick.

1043
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:43,416
Get me out of here.

1044
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:49,291
Okay, we'll get two of these.

1045
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:54,471
[Cell phone rings]

1046
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:57,082
This is Laura.

1047
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:59,563
Laura, hello,
it's Ella Browning.

1048
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:01,173
I know you said
you were done with this,

1049
00:58:01,303 --> 00:58:03,828
but I honestly don't think
that you should just walk away.

1050
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:05,220
I think you need to
come back and see me.

1051
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:06,395
I'm fine.

1052
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,310
I have an opening
today at 4:00.

1053
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:10,574
Thanks, but I don't need it.

1054
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:12,010
- You can't just barge in here!
- Laura!

1055
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,185
You can't just
barge in here!

1056
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:14,578
Laura, where are you?

1057
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,014
I'm through playing games!
Where is she?

1058
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:18,277
Laura, Laura, I won't
fill the appointment.

1059
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:19,408
Please do try to come.

1060
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:20,714
I gotta go.

1061
00:58:22,455 --> 00:58:23,848
Laura!

1062
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:25,458
Are-are you looking
for me, Charlie?

1063
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:27,808
No, I want to buy a condo.

1064
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:29,114
Thanks, Cathy.

1065
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:31,769
Let's not do this here...

1066
00:58:31,899 --> 00:58:32,857
We do this here,

1067
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:33,771
or we do it in front of Alix,

1068
00:58:33,901 --> 00:58:35,250
but we do it now.

1069
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:36,382
I'm not letting you
out of my sight again.

1070
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,514
You were
supposed to meet me

1071
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:38,471
two days ago.

1072
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:39,907
You didn't show up.

1073
00:58:40,038 --> 00:58:40,517
You obviously didn't
come to work yesterday

1074
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:41,300
because I was here.

1075
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,041
I waited all day,

1076
00:58:43,171 --> 00:58:47,262
so I am through taking you
at your so-called word.

1077
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:48,525
Let's go.

[Knocks]

1079
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:57,621
I expect you
to tell her the truth.

1080
00:58:57,751 --> 00:58:59,884
I'll tell her what
you want me to tell her.

1081
00:59:00,014 --> 00:59:01,755
I want you
to tell her the truth.

1082
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:04,192
[Sighs in disgust]

1083
00:59:04,323 --> 00:59:04,932
No, no, no,
please, please,

1084
00:59:05,063 --> 00:59:06,455
five minutes.

1085
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:07,500
That's all I want.

1086
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,111
What is she doing here?

1087
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,070
Please, just listen
to what she has to say.

1088
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,375
I don't want to hear
anything that she has to say!

1089
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:15,334
St-start talking.

1090
00:59:15,464 --> 00:59:17,379
It's not what you think
about Charley and me.

1091
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,468
Um, we met at work,

1092
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,818
and we had lunch
a few times.

1093
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:22,254
You had lunch?

1094
00:59:22,384 --> 00:59:23,647
I thought you said
she was a total stranger.

1095
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:26,127
No, we didn't
have lunch.

1096
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:27,999
We met in the coffee
shop downstairs,

1097
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:29,696

showing up?

1113
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,772
She did it all,
unprovoked.

1114
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:05,384

is in her head.

are you?

1123

1124
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:39,200
I am here now because
I cared about Charlie,

1125
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:40,549

than I can say for you.

1126

You didn't care
enough to fight.

1128

I did it.

1129

I said what
you wanted me to say,

1130
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:50,255

she's worth it.

He, uh,

1168

he brought me to see
a sculpture he made

W-We become
so emotionally needy,

1176

Well, I-I know
that you're real,

1183
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:24,061

1184

but I...

1185
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,718
I wonder if your love affair
with him is real.

1186
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:32,983
That's crazy.

1187

my relationship with Sam,

That's what I'm asking.

Often, when things
aren't going well

1191
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,601
in our primary
relationships,

1192
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:44,733
we create an escape,

1193
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:45,778
a-a connection

1194
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:49,042
that gives us what we need.

1195
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:50,827
For instance,
you want to go to Rome,

1196
01:03:50,957 --> 01:03:52,263
but you can't get there,

1197
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:54,482
so you paint a picture of it
on your wall,

1198
01:03:54,613 --> 01:03:56,571
a mural, a scene.

1199
01:03:56,702 --> 01:03:57,485

What you were doing

1211
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:25,035
was antithetical to your soul,

1212
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:26,514
so you created fantasies
around it

Come on, Harry,

1276
01:07:58,161 --> 01:07:59,466
whenever I push you
into anything,

1277
01:07:59,597 --> 01:08:01,816
you always end up
thanking me.

1278
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:03,209
Like I said, I don't
like being played.

[Nina chuckles]

1280
01:08:04,297 --> 01:08:05,820
You've been saying

1281
01:08:05,951 --> 01:08:07,039
that you're tired
of apartment living

1282
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:08,432
and you work so hard,

1283
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:10,695
and this place
is perfect to come home to.

1284
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:15,482
How'd it go?

1285
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:16,701
Nina's still
working on him.

1286
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:18,964
I think she'll get
what she wants.

1287
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:21,227
Hey...

1288
01:08:21,358 --> 01:08:22,620
So your client
went back

1289
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:23,534
to the magnolia
ranch house today.

1290
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:25,013
Not only that,

1291
01:08:25,144 --> 01:08:26,058
but I think your guy
is going to make an offer

1292
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:27,277
on the Mercer island house.

1293
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:28,191
We're on a roll.

1294
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:29,409
You're amazing.

1295
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,063
Get them both in escrow,

1296
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:32,630
and we've got some big-time
celebrating to do.

1297
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,153
I am all over it.

1298
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,331
Hi, Sam.

1299
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:40,420
Are you still the hottest
property in the office?

1300
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:43,162
You say that
to all the brokers.

1301
01:08:43,293 --> 01:08:45,599
Only the ones
I have to cancel on.

1302
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:47,862
I'm sorry, babe,
I can't do it tonight.

1303
01:08:47,993 --> 01:08:48,863
That's okay.

1305
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:53,738
If you hadn't canceled,
I-I would have canceled myself.

Um...

1307
01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:58,134
I really want to
make my marriage work, Sam.

1308
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:05,053
Well, if that's what you want,
then that's what I want for you.

1309
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:07,143
Thanks.

1310
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,145
I know you mean that.

1311
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:11,234

Ah.

1337
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:26,178
I wanted to see you
one last time,

1338
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:28,180
so I could keep
this image in my mind

1339
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:29,181
in case I ever weaken.

1340
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,357
What are you talking about?

1341
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,447
It should never surprise me
to catch you in a lie,

but somehow it always does.

to let you go.

Oh, hell,

1456
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,294
you made it happen.

1457
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:28,469
You can handle it alone.

1458
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,210
Why don't you
make the offer,

1459
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:31,559
and I'll discuss it
with him after,

1460
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:33,126
and we'll fax the counters
in the morning.

1461
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:34,519
Sounds great.

1462
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,825
He usually gets home
around 6:00

1463
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:36,739
to have dinner
with his kid.

1464
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:38,566
Well done.

1465
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,612
Thank you.

1466
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,625
[Cell phone rings]

1467
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:55,453
Hello.

1468
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,542
Laura,
it's Ella Browning.

1469
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,022
Hello.

1470
01:17:59,152 --> 01:18:00,676
I'm glad
I finally reached you.

1471
01:18:00,806 --> 01:18:02,373
You haven't been
returning my calls.

1472
01:18:02,503 --> 01:18:04,549
I've been busy.

1473
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,204
Laura...

1474
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:09,075
I read about Sam in the paper.

1475
01:18:09,206 --> 01:18:12,600
That was your Sam,
wasn't it?

1476
01:18:12,731 --> 01:18:14,515
It said
he was a musician.

1477
01:18:14,646 --> 01:18:17,431
He worked at the jazz club
on 65th.

1478
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:18,737
Sad, isn't it?

1479
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:21,740
They say he was mugged
in the street.

1480
01:18:21,871 --> 01:18:24,830
You must be devastated.

1481
01:18:24,961 --> 01:18:27,746
[Casually]: I am.

1482
01:18:27,877 --> 01:18:30,009
Laura...

1483
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:33,143
Have you...
Talked to the police?

1484
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:35,623
Why would I?

1485
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,364
I thought you might have
something to tell them.

1486
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:38,278
What could I tell them?

1487
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:39,410
I wasn't there.

1488
01:18:42,543 --> 01:18:44,458
Does it not bother you, Laura,

1489
01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:46,243
that the man you say
you were involved with

1490
01:18:46,373 --> 01:18:48,332
was murdered in the street?

1491
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:49,594
I don't say
anything.

1492
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,769
That's your fantasy.

1493
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,076
Sam was very real,

1494
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:55,774
and, frankly,
I'm starting to feel harassed.

1495
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:58,603
I'm just concerned
about you, Laura, that's all.

1496
01:18:58,734 --> 01:18:59,865
That's why I'm calling.

1497
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:02,433
No, it's not.

1498
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:04,522
You want to involve me
in Sam's death somehow.

1499
01:19:04,652 --> 01:19:06,002
Well, I'm not
going there.

1500
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:07,568
It was a random
street crime.

1501
01:19:07,699 --> 01:19:09,266
That's what
the papers say,

1502
01:19:09,396 --> 01:19:10,397
and I believe them.

1503
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:11,442
Well, I don't.

1504
01:19:11,572 --> 01:19:14,750
What's that supposed to mean?

1505
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,450
It means I think
you need help, Laura.

1506
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:22,409
It means I don't believe
any of this happened

1507
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,368
the way you say it did.

1508
01:19:25,935 --> 01:19:29,286
I think you need
to come and see me.

1509
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:32,289
You know, I think I do, too.

1510
01:19:51,482 --> 01:19:52,483
[Laughter echoing]

1511
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:54,833
Emily!

1512
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:56,487
Emily,
where'd you go?

1513
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:58,794
Mommy! Mommy!
Save me!

1514

Well, hello, missus.
Please come in.

1522
01:20:55,938 --> 01:20:56,808
Hello, Yolanda.

1523
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:03,423
Dr. Jarretts?

1524
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:04,381
Laura Phillips.

1525
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:05,512
Oh, hi.

1526
01:21:05,643 --> 01:21:07,210
We haven't formally met,

1527
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:08,646
but I've seen you
showing the house, of course.

1528
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:11,649
Hello, Emily.

1529
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:13,956
It's good
to see you again.

1530
01:21:14,086 --> 01:21:15,566
Um, listen,

1531
01:21:15,696 --> 01:21:17,568
I brought
something for you.

1532
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:19,439
You like charm bracelets,
don't you?

1533
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:20,788
Oh, you bet.

1534
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:22,921
We collect them.

1535
01:21:23,052 --> 01:21:25,489
Well, I like
this little bear the best.

1536
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:27,926
Me too.

1537
01:21:28,057 --> 01:21:30,363
Put your hand out.

1538
01:21:32,452 --> 01:21:35,281
There you go.

1540
01:21:36,587 --> 01:21:38,067
Wow, huh?

1541
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:39,372
Now, let me show you
what I've brought for you.

1542
01:21:41,722 --> 01:21:44,638
You'll need to discuss
this offer with Suzanne

1543
01:21:44,769 --> 01:21:47,685
and then respond
by 7:00 tomorrow night.

1544

[Sighs heavily]

1545
01:21:54,735 --> 01:21:56,389
It's a good price.

1546
01:21:58,348 --> 01:22:01,568
Yeah, I'm sure
we can make this work.

1547

very pleased.

I heard about what happened.

You have my deepest condolences.

Thank you.

1554
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:31,729
We had, um,

1555
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:33,992
planned on
moving downtown

1556
01:22:34,123 --> 01:22:35,776
to shorten my commute

1557
01:22:35,907 --> 01:22:38,910
so I could spend more time
with the family.

1558
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:42,131
Well, I guess that's
more important now

1559
01:22:42,261 --> 01:22:43,654
than ever, isn't it?

kind of you.
