00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:03,793
And, girls,
let me remind you,

187
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:06,448
let'’s try to watch
our calorie intake

188
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:09,793
over the next few weeks
before the pageant.

189
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:13,172
Let this be your
personal creed.

190
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:17,344
"Eat smart, think thin,
and win!"

191
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,620
Excuse me,
I'’m very sorry.

I--I was cat sitting 
Eartha, like you told me to,

195
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:33,586
and she got out of the house,
and she ran up a tree.

196
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:34,689
The fire department is there.

197
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,172
She won'’t come down.

198
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:37,827
Eartha was hissing
and everything.

199
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,103
One guy got clawed.

200
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:40,551
They'’re gonna chop
down the tree!

201
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,689
You gotta come home
right away!

202
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:42,586
They'’re pissed.

203
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:43,482
Oh, my God.

204
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:44,896
Eartha, my kitty.

205
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,275
Ms. Prunish,
I gotta go.

206
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:48,344
My kitty Eartha'’s in trouble.

207
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,206
Who was that...

208
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,344
boy?

209
00:11:57,413 --> 00:12:01,793
That was Cameron Owens,
all time major geek

210
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:03,655

211
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,931

out with that thing,

213
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,310
I see.

214
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,068
Girls, let me end
with a few final thoughts,

215
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:19,931
first, I want you all
to concentrate on this pageant.

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,758
Second, I want none of you
to display yourselves

217
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,517
in the fashion that I saw
displayed before me

218
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,724
in this room tonight.

219
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:33,758
And third, I want
that Larder girl out

220
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:37,206
of my pageant!

221
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:41,034
Since it is impossible
to do anything about that now,

222
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:44,344
you are each personally
charged with a mission.

223
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,620
Make this pageant
a living hell for her.

224
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:58,206
Do we understand
each other, girls?

225
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:01,413
Good.

226
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:03,655
Thank you all
for coming this evening.

227
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:06,724
May the best girl win.

228
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:09,482
And we all know
who won'’t.

229
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:14,517
Next time,
we are not coming out.

230
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,724
Oh, I'’m sorry.

231
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,896
I'’m so sorry!

232
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,413
My poor baby.

233
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:22,827
She thinks I'’m going
after that damn cat again,

234
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:25,000
she can just forget it.

235
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:27,379
Geeze, the way she looks,
it'’s a wonder

236
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:28,896
she hadn'’t eaten that cat.

237
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:31,448
I'’d run up a tree, too,
if I saw her comin'’ at me.

238
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,413
[engine starting]

239
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:39,896
Poor baby.

240
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:41,482
My poor baby.

241
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,241
Cameron, how did this happen?

242
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,655
Well, I was watching Jeopardy,
and I was winning, as usual,

243
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:50,103
and I spilled some milk
down the front of my pants

244
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:51,965
and then when I went
to go get a towel

245
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:54,000
to clean it up,
I saw the paper boy ride by,

246
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:56,000
so, I figured I'’d go out
and get the paper.

247
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,689
And when I opened
the screen door,

248
00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:59,896
Eartha got out,
and then Mr. Coldwell'’s dog

249
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,206
was sitting there,
and he took off after her.

250
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,620
And Eartha went tearing
up that tree.

251
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,586
I didn'’t even get a chance
to see the bonus round.

252
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:06,655
That'’s what happened.

253
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,758
Oh, well, I'’m just glad
she'’s okay.

254
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:12,275
She'’s all I have, you know.

255
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:15,586
Cameron, you were so smart
to call the fire department.

256
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,275
I don'’t know what
I'’d do without you.

257
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,103
Well, it--it wasn'’t
that hard,

258
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:21,344
except that when I hit
the auto dial emergency number

259
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,931
on the phone,
it was Rapid Ready Pizza.

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,310
Did you know
that it was wrong?

261
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:26,827
Oh, wow.

262
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,068
That'’s kinda weird.

263
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:30,344
I wonder how
that happened?

264
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:31,379
Oh, well.

265
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:32,206
Thanks anyway.

no problem.

the meeting go?

is so nice.

on how to win and everything!

00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,862
I actually think
I may have a chance.

272
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,413
Now, all I have to do
is come up with a talent

273
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:48,448
and get a swimsuit
and an evening gown.

274

At the top

1771
01:41:29,724 --> 01:41:32,103
tragedy has struck
for a third time in Silvis

1772
01:41:32,172 --> 01:41:34,965
for the ill-fated Silvis
Slough Queen contestants.

1773
01:41:35,034 --> 01:41:38,172
The latest victim of the Beauty
Queen Butcher is Alison Murphy.

1774
01:41:38,241 --> 01:41:39,689
Alison was found
early this morning

1775
01:41:39,758 --> 01:41:42,379
by a group of citizens
collecting aluminum cans

1776
01:41:42,448 --> 01:41:44,758
for the Citizens for
a Cleaner Silvis project.

1777
01:41:44,827 --> 01:41:46,068
Also found on the scene

1778
01:41:46,137 --> 01:41:48,689
was Ms. Murphy'’s boyfriend,
Paul Whitewater.

1779
01:41:48,758 --> 01:41:50,206
Whitewater was taken

1780
01:41:50,275 --> 01:41:52,241
to the Silvis County Sheriff'’s
office for questioning,

1781
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:54,620
then later released
on his own recognizance.

1782
01:41:54,689 --> 01:41:58,137
Our woman on top--on the go,
Tammi Conklin

1783
01:41:58,206 --> 01:42:00,344

this report.

1785
01:42:04,068 --> 01:42:09,000
As you see, the Sheriff'’s office
is rather quiet at this time.

I have with me now
Mable Jones,

1787
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:13,172
who was at the scene
this morning.

1788
01:42:13,241 --> 01:42:15,758
Mable, can you
tell us what happened?

1789
01:42:15,827 --> 01:42:19,275
Yes, Tammi, we started
out about 6 A.M. as usual

1790
01:42:19,344 --> 01:42:22,241
to collect cans to raise money
for the new fountain here

1791
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:23,793
in front of
the court house.

1792
01:42:23,862 --> 01:42:26,758
There were the ten of us,
Merv, Carol, Fred,

1793
01:42:26,827 --> 01:42:29,206
Ethel, Lorna, you know,
the whole gang.

1794
01:42:29,275 --> 01:42:31,551
We decided to go down
by the waterfront

1795
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:33,551
because we can usually
make quite a haul

1796
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:35,034

1797

been out drinkin'’ all night.

Now that bothers me,
Tammi.

1799

how to have fun

1800
01:42:41,896 --> 01:42:46,551
without all the drugs,
alcohol, and sex.

1801
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:49,275
Well, anyway, we come up
on this sandbar,

1802
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:52,482
and that'’s when I see this girl
laying on this blanket

1803
01:42:52,551 --> 01:42:55,344
practically naked
with her hair all a mess,

1804
01:42:55,413 --> 01:42:57,448
and this big ribbon
around her neck.

1805
01:42:57,517 --> 01:42:59,068
I knew something was wrong

1806
01:42:59,137 --> 01:43:03,206
when I pulled that beer can out
of her hand, she never moved.

1807
01:43:03,275 --> 01:43:06,344
Now that'’s when Fred found
the young man lying in the car

1808
01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:09,862
practically naked,
and he called the police.

1809
01:43:09,931 --> 01:43:13,137
The stench of alcohol
was everywhere.

1810
01:43:13,206 --> 01:43:17,103
These young people today
have got to be disciplined!

around unsupervised.
