We pulled up, and this poor slob
was standing in his front lawn.

the other.

The guy was waving the gun
around her head.

John thought he could talk the
guy in to giving up gun.

a crowd was forming.

with a guy.

home.

MAGGIE HEWITT [ON PHONE]: I've
got Rex.

1272
01:14:46,612 --> 01:14:48,266
Put him on.

1273
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:49,572
REX [ON PHONE]: So?

1274
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:50,877
The beach.

1275
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:53,010
6:30 AM.

1276
01:14:53,053 --> 01:14:54,620
Just north of the Santa Monica
pier.

1280
01:16:21,228 --> 01:16:23,970
Kind of windy out today, huh?

1281
01:16:24,014 --> 01:16:27,408
You know, I've never been down
here before.

1282
01:16:27,452 --> 01:16:30,977
Been in town a long time but
never been to the beach.

1283
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:33,937
Kind of like it.

1284
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:37,244
Might have to come down here
more often.

1285
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:38,637
You wouldn't happen to have any
buddies

1286
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:41,031
down here, huh, Shepard?

1287
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:42,641
Let's just do it.

1288
01:16:42,685 --> 01:16:44,077
Shall we?

1289
01:16:44,121 --> 01:16:45,775
Man's in a hurry.

1290
01:16:45,818 --> 01:16:47,690
I like that.

1291
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:51,389
Now, this how it works.

1292
01:16:51,432 --> 01:16:56,916
When I give Maggie the thumbs
up.

1293
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,137
She yells lights, then camera.

1294
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:05,272
Then when she yells action, we
slap leather.

1295
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:08,319
Couldn't get any simpler than
that, could it?

1296
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:10,147
You do have another gun other
than that, don't you?

1297
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:18,285
That's very nice.

1298
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:21,941
357 snub nose.

1299
01:17:21,985 --> 01:17:24,161
Don't have one of those.

1300
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:27,120
Now, why don't you take it out
of your belt. Real carefully

1301
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:28,556
now.

1302
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,123
That's right.

1303
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:31,690
Put it right down by your side.

1304
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:36,739
All right.

1305
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:46,183
Now, when Miss Hewitt says,
time's up, you aim and shoot.

1306
01:17:46,226 --> 01:17:49,186
Are you fast enough, huh,
Shepard?

1307
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:51,144
Are you fast?

1308
01:17:51,188 --> 01:17:52,624
You sure are a gabby kid.

1309
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:58,674
Role them, Maggie.

1310
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:03,069
Goodbye, Shepard.

1311
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,380
Say those magic words, Maggie.

1312
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:15,821
Do it.

1313
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:30,183
Lights, camera, action.

1314
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:37,713
REX: I hope you got all that on
film, didn't you?

You cheated, Shepard.

You bastard.

1318
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:58,429
I had to.

1319
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:00,561
You're too fast.

1320
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:01,475
Fast but stupid.

That was great.

It sucked.

I'm much better looking than the
guy who played me.
