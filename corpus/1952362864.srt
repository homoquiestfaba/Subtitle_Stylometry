00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,231
<i>Thank you, Tom. This is Kip Wellington
at Springfield Penitentiary,</i>

2
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,770
<i>where notorious inmate Shawn Gracey
is still on the loose.</i>

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,066
<i>Gracey was apprehended three years ago</i>

4
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,334
<i>by the police for the murders
of over 35 people</i>

5
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,273
<i>in a small suburban town.</i>

6
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,868
<i>Police and authorities
are still working around the clock</i>

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,346
<i>to capture this notorious criminal.</i>

8
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,111
<i>We will be following the story,
and I will be checking in as it...</i>

9
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,820
No. Oh, my God.

10
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,418
Oh, my God!

11
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,688
Come on, Betsy! Betsy, please! Oh, no!

12
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,595
Betsy. Betsy, wake up.

13
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,429
Please...

14
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,664
You fucking asshole!

15
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,800
You just let her die?

16
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,920
Lmpressive wine cellar.

17
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,584
I was so surprised
you made your own.

18
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,298
I've always wondered if this worked.

19
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,526
No.

20
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,733
No!

21
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,565
Please no. No. Stop.

22
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,637
You know, they say the doctor says

23
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,514
<i>a glass of wine...
it's good for the heart.</i>

24
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,403
Hold still.

25
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,206
Could've aged it better.

26
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,166
Well, what do you think, Betsy?

27
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,202
Be honest.

28
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,362
Speak.

29
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,463
Yeah. Yeah, kind of.

30
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,538
I did the rest of
the 'shrooms last night.

31
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,936
Gave me messed. Up dreams.

32
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,110
Because I was bored, and I had them.

33
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,652
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

34
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,549
See you there.

35
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,516
There you go.

36
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,527
Thank you, dear.

37
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,857
No problem.

38
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,398
My little granddaughter's
gonna love these.

39
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,992
I don't know why my son put them
up so high in the first place.

40
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,765
Doesn't matter now anyway, does it?

41
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,670
You're right.

42
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,407
Are you okay?

43
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,144
These days, not so much.

44
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,083
What's wrong?

45
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,178
It's nothing to worry about.

46
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,588
I think my doctor
has to adjust one of my pills.

47
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,888
Mrs. Spool, about your medicine...

48
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,796
What would I do without you?

49
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:59,600
I've been switching it out
for quite a while now.

50
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,933
All of it.

51
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,268
What?

52
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,935
- Yeah.
- Why?

53
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,174
I just wanted to see how long it would take.

54
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,877
Call 911.

55
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,386
Diabetes, high blood pressure,

56
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,354
congestive heart failure.

57
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:22,086
You know, you hung in there
a lot longer than I thought.

58
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,458
Please...

59
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,901
Please...

60
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,805
Tell me, does it hurt?

61
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,575
Yes.

62
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,141
Well, that's a bummer.

63
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,968
I always get the same thing.

64
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,301
- It doesn't hurt to look.
- That's what she said.

65
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,772
- That doesn't even apply.
- It always applies.

66
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,571
I would like to apply
your face to the bar.

67
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,771
You're so rough, Donna.

68
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,043
So how does the band sound
on the new equipment?

69
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,276
Fucking fantastic.

70
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,478
Although I need you to come on over
and help me with the wiring.

71
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,986
What's wrong with the wires?

72
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,556
It's gonna be my last hurrah.

73
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,090
Shut up, dude. You're not quitting.

74
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,683
Being in a band
in high school was cool,

75
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,284
but it's different now.

76
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,624
Old man Mike.

77
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,961
That's who you are now.

78
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,693
You have responsibilities
to the band.

79
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,701
I'm not being old, Sam.

80
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,964
<i>I'm just telling... I'm being realistic.</i>

81
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,699
What do you think, penis?

82
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,775
- Don!
- You serious?

83
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,041
My Christ,
will you just go talk to her?

84
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,138
Soon enough.

85
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,048
You've been staring at that girl
for three freaking years, Don,

86
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,711
and in that time, you've said what?

87
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,686
I don't know. 17 words to her.

88
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,191
And you're just pissed off
because I still got options.

89
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,624
You're the one that's getting hitched.

90
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,593
That's something
I don't want to talk about.

91
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,289
Shut up.

92
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,594
Besides, he's trying
to get back together with Liz.

93
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,067
- No, I am not.
- You totally are.

94
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,536
Okay. A little.

95
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,233
You're both nuts.

96
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,169
Only in my dreams.

97
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,372
Stop obsessing, Debbie Gibson.

98
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,473
Yeah. Snagged.

99
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,552
Jenn, give me the hot wings, please.

100
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,178
I'll take the usual.
I'm gonna empty the tank.

101
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,881
Can I get another orange juice?

102
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,959
- Sure.
- Thanks.

103
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,421
Aw, man.

104
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,595
Yeah, I'll have a burger.

105
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:43,935
Say, Jenn,

106
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,964
Dickhead Don
is having a party this weekend.

107
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,565
You son of a bitch.

108
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,112
Why don't you and Janet stop by?

109
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,840
We might be able to fit that
into our schedules.

110
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,975
Awesome.

111
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,849
You're a fucking genius.

112
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,324
- What?
- Nothing.

113
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,622
Everything come out okay?

114
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,437
Well, I'd love to stay
for the happy ending,

115
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,443
- but I gotta get back to frigging work.
- I hear that.

116
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,036
I told Elizabeth
I'd help her out at the store.

117
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,950
- See you.
- That's who you're tied to, pal.

118
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,952
I'll see you, Mike.

119
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,249
You're a pinky. Finger marionette.

120
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,187
You're a loser.

121
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,782
Don't forget to come over tonight
and help me out with the wiring, okay?

122
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,725
You got it.

123
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,012
Good day, Lizzie.

124
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,612
Nice of you to show up, bud.

125
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,215
Queen Elizabeth
couldn't start without me?

126
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,420
It just wouldn't have been any fun.

127
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,590
Besides, you were the one
that offered to help.

128
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,530
I didn't think you'd actually
take me up on it.

129
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,431
Creep.

130
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,549
So you're really gonna move?

131
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,018
I really am.

132
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,792
You're gonna miss me
and the guys.

133
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:51,056
Don, you knew I was planning

134
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,688
to move to Santa Monica
before Mom's heart attack.

135
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,357
She's feeling better.

136
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:59,528
Yeah. We can just buy the place
and let them retire in Florida.

137
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,931
Stop being such a goon.

138
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,942
I know.

139
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,602
I'm just saying.

140
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,111
We always fight.

141
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,047
You always start them.

142
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,311
Don't you realize
how perfect things could be

143
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,411
if, you know,
you just kind of did what I said?

144
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,183
Lived at my beck and call.

145
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,126
You are such a creep.

146
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:26,562
And besides, everybody knows
you love Janet.

147
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,399
Come on.
You know that's a goof.

148
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,402
No. You are.

149
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,972
Speaking of mature...

150
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,307
Oh, God.

151
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,607
Knock it off.

152
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,151
What are you doing?

153
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,190
I want that one.

154
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,225
Just one second.

155
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,464
Yeah. Speak.

156
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,001
Yes.

157
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,300
No. You're supposed
to click out of that.

158
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,609
My mom just got a new Mac.

159
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,235
No, Mom, you're not supposed to be
in System Preferences.

160
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,904
Just don't click on that.

161
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,473
I can't believe this.

162
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,484
Go help her.

163
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,749
<i>Mom... Mom... Mom...</i>

164
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,422
Mom, okay, look, I will come over
to the house to help.

165
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,018
Just don't touch anything.

166
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,563
Okay.

167
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,768
They never listen.

168
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,804
Go and help your mom, Don.

169
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,806
We can finish this stuff
in the morning.

170
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,307
You sure?

171
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,675
Unless there's any more literature
you'd like to swipe from me today.

172
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,305
No, actually, you can take this back.

173
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,317
Hey, you still having
that thing on Friday?

174
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,913
Yeah, of course.

175
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,825
You should come.

176
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,929
I'll see you in the morning.

177
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,931
I promise.

178
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,710
Do you gotta chew like that?

179
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,874
I mean, do you have to chew like that?

180
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,813
It doesn't ring, dick slap.
It just flashes a light.

181
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,615
By the way,
how'd you guys get in here?

182
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,851
Back door was open.

183
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,289
Okay, I gotta head to Doc's.

184
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,606
So where is the old coot anyway?

185
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,541
Didn't ask.

186
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,013
What is that smell?

187
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,642
Sorry. I farted.

188
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,412
No, not that one. The other one.

189
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,420
<i>Doc Bates... he's semiretired.</i>

190
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,219
He's got sort of
a dental office set up downstairs.

191
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,225
He has nitrous.

192
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,318
Don't even think about going
close to that entrance.

193
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,727
Party pooper.

194
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,430
Let's go, guys.

195
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,566
<i>You think S. W.A. T.
Was a better show than The A. Team?</i>

196
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,747
Cute doggy.

197
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,510
Thank you.

198
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,915
She really loves that dog?

199
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,488
Yeah, she does.
She'd love one of her own,

200
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,921
but I just don't have the time.

201
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,890
That's not yours?

202
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,053
No. It's Laurie's. We're neighbors.

203
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,323
We bring them here together

204
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,796
so they can tire
each other out, you know?

205
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,731
Isn't that cute?

206
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,109
You live around here?

207
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,111
No. I was just going for a walk,

208
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,272
and the bench looked comfortable.

209
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,885
You really should get her
a dog of her own.

210
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,687
Excuse me?

211
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,693
Yeah.

212
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,127
Kids need something to take care of.

213
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,461
It makes them better mommies.

214
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,265
Tina,

215
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,134
let's go.

216
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,434
Yeah, you agree. That's what I said.

217
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,172
Laurie, we'll see you later.

218
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,680
. Bye.
. Hi.

219
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,682
I know. He has the best house.

220
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,649
So they were like, "We'll
see you next Wednesday,"

221
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,015
and that was that.

222
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,021
I'm sorry.

223
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,351
Mrs. Muggles,

224
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,154
you really should leave people alone.

225
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,252
So obviously, party this weekend?

226
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,991
I know. Right?
I think he's bringing lots of beer.

227
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,935
You could've hired
somebody to do that.

228
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,442
Might be time to throw out the butter.

229
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,317
These wires look like a rat's nest.

230
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,549
I told you not to touch them
until I got back.

231
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,493
So, dude, I have a confession.

232
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,188
Don't do it, douche!

233
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,855
Do what?

234
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,227
Do what?

235
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,324
Ah, fuck!

236
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,447
Honey, look what I did. I'm sorry.

237
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,786
Let me see if I've got
something to fix you up.

238
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,690
What do you got in here?

239
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,626
Really.

240
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,230
Oh, my God. I've always wanted
to see if this works.

241
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,040
Shocked myself good.

242
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,044
That's what you get.

243
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,545
Too bad it didn't kill you.

244
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,809
Oh, yeah? Hey, do me a favor.

245
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,011
Don't use these externals
until I get a chance to fix them.

246
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,926
Now, I knew that wasn't gonna work.

247
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,226
I'll tell you what.

248
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,234
I'm gonna be really, really nice.

249
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,962
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

250
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,610
Seriously, I don't get how you dong bags

251
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,580
thought that inviting Janet
would be funny.

252
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,847
Oh, come on. Everybody knows
you're getting back together with Liz.

253
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,980
You're gonna work it all out
and end up like this asshole.

254
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,490
Liz was busting my chops
about her today.

255
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,084
I'm free. I could take Janet.

256
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,685
You're a douche.

257
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,099
Whatever.

258
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,894
I just wish you two
would get hit by a bus.

259
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:49,064
Hey, so, if I ever
get locked out or whatever...

260
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,801
And, actually,
you can do something for me.

261
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,207
I got a shitload to do on Friday
since it's gonna take me

262
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,974
a little while to get back,
so can you guys set up for me?

263
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,412
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I can.

264
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,416
Oh, and you should know

265
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,543
- that I gave the key to that girl.
- Who?

266
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,747
The girl from Craig's List.

267
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,848
The one that I found.
You know, the intern, the helper...

268
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,756
Whatever. I thought
I told you about her.

269
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,692
You didn't say it would be a girl.

270
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,697
Well, she's into music production,

271
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,290
and it's gonna look good
on her resume.

272
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,164
Such a Samaritan.

273
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,636
Do you even know what that means?

274
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,706
Yes, I do.

275
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,342
Can we go upstairs
and watch the movie now?

276
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,309
I told Nancy I wouldn't be too late.

277
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,642
What?

278
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,151
Fuck you guys.

279
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,889
<i>...where notorious inmate

I can't believe it.

290
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,287
That movie was bad.
That movie was just plain bad.

291
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,291
Young man,
there's no need to feel down.

292
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,291
Nice coat.

293
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,887
Okay, guys. Hey.

294
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,193
I gotta get up early
to help out Elizabeth.

295
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,394
Wow. Well, be careful you don't burn up
in the morning sun like a vampire.

296
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:27,180
- Vampire!
- I'll burn your face.

297
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,900
- Wow.
- My rapier wit.

298
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,100
Oh, shit. I forgot my trash.

299
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,060
Sellout.

300
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,460
- Both of you.
- Was that for you?

301
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
And now that you've littered yourself.

302
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,580
Dude, call me tomorrow.

303
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,620
How's it going, Karen?

304
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,420
How are you?

305
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,740
Who's the best?

306
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,260
You are.

307
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,140
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

308
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,780
So guess who just
paid me a visit at my car.

309
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,100
Who?

310
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,260
- Tony D.
- Tony D?

311
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,620
- That guy's out of control.
- I know.

312
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,580
He got me last week.

313
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,060
He just wants your money.

314
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,060
You didn't give him any money, did you?

315
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,740
Of course I gave him money.

316
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,380
It's your fault.

317
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,180
You didn't give him any money?

318
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,700
No.

319
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,100
I gave him a banana.

320
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,700
I had a banana in my bag,
so I gave it to him.

321
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,300
Because you were concerned
about his potassium levels.

322
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,220
Right?

323
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,580
Well, you know,
I want him to be healthy.

324
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,260
<i>- Thank you, Tom. This is Kip Wellington...

326
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,620

<i>What the...</i>

333
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,540
What the fuck is going on?

334
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,580
Hope you don't mind.
I borrowed some clothes.

335
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,420
They smelled kind of clean.

336
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,620
What the fuck?

337
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,540
Who the hell are you?

338
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,500
What is this?

339
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
Okay, okay, okay.

340
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,740
All right. This is some kind of joke, right?

341
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,540
You're some kind of stripper
or something, right?

342
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,540
Yeah. That's very funny, guys.

343
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,300
It's hysterical.

344
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,700
Okay, here we go.

345
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,700
Thanks, guys.

346
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,700
This is great.

347
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,900
You can come out now.

348
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,820
God damn.

349
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,300
<i>- What...
- I am not a stripper.</i>

350
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
What the fuck?

351
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,500
Don't speak.

352
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,380
Fuck!

353
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,700
Do you like this now?

354
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,620
<i>I swear to God,
when I get out of here, I'm gonna...</i>

355
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,540
Come on.

356
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,900
Knock it the fuck off.

357
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,340
You will not move from this seat.

358
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,380
<i>Oh, God! That's...</i>

359
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,620
Oh, God!

360
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,700
Fuck! Fuck!

361
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,500
Fuck!

362
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,140
You will not sleep.

363
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,660
You want to see something
really scary?

364
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,980
Lts natural environment is a hole.

365
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,380
Time to go home now, buddy.

366
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,020
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch worm!

367
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,500
Why don't you just go home?
That is your home now! Go home!

368
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,500
That is your home now!

369
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,220
Disgusting!

370
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,300
I have to wash this shit off of me,
thank you very much.

371
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,780
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

372
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,340
All right.

373
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,820
Oh, shit.

374
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,420
Look at what I did.

375
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,580
Eat a bowl of dicks.

376
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,020
Well, you've got a dirty mouth.

377
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,500
We should clean that up.

378
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,140
Let me the fuck go.

379
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Is it safe?

380
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,140
Un. Fucking. Tie me,

381
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,260
and I won't rip out your larynx.

382
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,620
Is it safe?

383
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,660
Is what safe?

384
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,180
No!

385
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,540
You look like a marlin.

386
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,900
Get it the fuck out!

387
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,340
Wait. Hold still.

388
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,980
Sorry. Tricked you.

389
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,660
What do you care anyway? It's out.

390
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,780
Here. Chew on this for a bit.

391
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,700
You're getting blood
all over the place.

392
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,700
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

393
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,580
The coffee.

394
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,540
Hey, I really like these mugs.

395
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,540
Where'd you get them?

396
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,460
Hot.

397
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,860
Why?

398
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,900
"Why"?

399
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,140
Why you can afford to live
in a place like this.

400
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,020
That's what I want to know.

401
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,100
It's just you. No housemates.

402
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,140
Go to hell.

403
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,220
You have no idea
where I've been, brother.

404
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,940
What happened here?

405
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,380
Go fuck yourself.

406
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,260
I don't want you to pass out.

407
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,420
What?

408
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,380
You'll see.

409
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,380
You got a lot of fun stuff here.

410
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,900
Hey, it's all yours.

411
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,020
Just get the hell out of here.

412
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,660
I don't want your junk, pal.

413
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,540
Oh, fuck!

414
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,380
Fuck!

415
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Oh, fuck!

416
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,380
<i>Go...</i>

417
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,300
Gnarly. A fake kneecap.

418
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,860
You must've had all kinds
of rehab for this.

419
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,340
"Are you coming by later?"

420
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,020
Sorry.

421
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,140
All tied up with work.

422
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,860
Stop by later.

423
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,900
Smiley face.

424
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,220
Oh, fuck!

425
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Hey, asshole,

426
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,220
I brought some, uh, T. Shirts.

427
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,860
Hi.

428
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,900
Hi.

429
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,700
Hello.

430
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,460
Hi.

431
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,340
So you're her.

432
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,060
"Her"?

433
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,180
Craig's List.

434
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,180
Yeah.

435
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,700
Yeah, I'm Jenn.

436
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,580
That's funny. We know a Jenn.

437
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,100
Yeah. Who doesn't?

438
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,940
Seriously.

439
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,660
Yeah, so, I'm just doing
some work for him downstairs.

440
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,180
Really?

441
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,620
<i>It's probably my band...
The Low Budgets.</i>

442
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,580
I like it.

443
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,540
Well, we're having a show
this Saturday at the Rusty Nail.

444
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,620
You should come by
and bring some friends.

445
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,100
I totally will.

446
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,860
And I patched the external wiring.

447
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,820
You did? Really?

448
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,820
I've got a broad education.

449
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,780
I see that.

450
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,580
So the mix will be done
by the party for sure.

451
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,460
Sweet.

452
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,940
I'll probably see you Saturday?

453
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,540
I can let myself out.

454
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,500
You must be thirsty.

455
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,820
There you go.

456
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,860
It's good for you. Little more.

457
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,300
Little more.

458
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Come on.

459
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,740
Sam's outside.

460
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,060
What?

461
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,500
Sam?

462
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,340
Sam, help me!

463
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,380
Don? Yo. Donny.

464
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,420
Don. Donny.

465
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,220
Did you pick up those...

466
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,860
What happened to your face?

467
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,260
<i>What the...</i>

468
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,780
You are not an intern.

469
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,780
Okay?

470
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,260
Don, I'm sorry about this.

471
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,940
Sam...

472
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,420
Get up, Sam!

473
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,420
You okay, man?

474
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,780
Kill that fucking bitch!

475
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,420
Sam...

476
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,740
Don, you're okay.

477
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,580
You're okay, hon. You're okay.

478
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,740
Jesus.

479
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:59,420
I wish the doctor could just give me
a pill to forget about this whole thing.

480
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,420
I know you do, sweetie.

481
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,820
Come up to bed.

482
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,460
Okay.

483
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,380
Okay. Be right there.

484
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,420
I'm never gonna
get used to that thing.

485
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,420
That's the point.

486
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,100
<i>- Don't forget to...
- Pick up my suit.</i>

487
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,900
I know.

488
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,940
Just reminding you.

489
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,020
Thank you, sweetheart.

490
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,220
You don't want to be late, Liz.

491
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,820
Yeah. Right. Okay.

492
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,900
I'll be back by lunchtime.

493
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,820
I'll be here.

494
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,660
<i>Well, bef...</i>

495
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,300
She's still not
gonna be there, Don.

496
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,780
DC's a pretty long commute.

497
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,580
And besides, aren't you living
with your girlfriend now, piggy?

498
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,780
It's a habit, I swear.

499
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,780
So how nervous are you?

500
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,620
Scared shitless, right?

501
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,740
No, not really.

502
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,300
That's bullshit.

503
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,220
That's what I want.

504
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,500
Don't forget your suits, dicks.

505
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,460
Don. Suits. All right?

506
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,540
Okay. And don't wear
that bandana, please.

507
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,340
I'm going to wear
nothing but the bandana.

508
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,340
Jesus!

509
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,980
I'm sorry.

510
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,940
I wasn't even thinking.

511
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,980
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

512
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,100
Okay.

513
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,500
I'm sorry, too.

514
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,340
You okay?

515
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,100
Yeah.

516
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,220
So what did the doctor say?

517
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,260
Really?

518
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,620
Really?

519
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,820
Wow.

520
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,540
It's pretty cool.

521
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,340
It's really cool.

522
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,140
<i>Did you remember to...</i>

523
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,940
No.

524
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,300
Wow.

525
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,340
Sam, help me!

526
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,820
That's enough.

527
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,780
It can wait.

528
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,700
Sam!

529
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,100
Aren't you nervous at all?

530
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,740
Just for the first dance.

531
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,740
Mike cannot dance a step.

532
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,660
I know. Don's not much
of a dancer, either.

533
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,660
I didn't meant it that way.

534
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,180
I know you didn't.

535
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,180
How's he been?

536
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,860
Is he still going to the shrink?

537
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,020
Yeah.

538
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,820
He still has some bad days.

539
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,460
But more good lately.

540
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,300
That's good.

541
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,340
He's a strong guy,

542
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,340
and he's got you.

543
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,820
Thanks.

544
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,380
Yeah.

545
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,300
You want to dance, Lizzie?

546
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,620
Go ahead.

547
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,100
You sure?

548
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,980
You know I hate dancing.

549
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,180
No! No!

550
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,460
What's wrong, honey?

551
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,820
Don, you okay?

552
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,820
I didn't have to dance with her, dude.

553
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,460
I feel like such a jackass.

554
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,460
It's no big deal.

555
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,140
I was so dumb.

556
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,900
Everyone understands.

557
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,860
I love you so much.

558
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,540
Oh, yeah?

559
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,980
Yeah.

560
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,260
Sorry.

561
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,820
That's okay.

562
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,820
I took a pill.

563
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,620
Jesus.

564
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,700
Jesus! What the fuck?

565
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,900
Get the fuck off me!

566
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,500
Get off me!

567
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,540
God. You were raping me.

568
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,500
<i>What the...</i>

569
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,340
Oh, my God.

570
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,180
You sick fuck! You sick fucking fuck!

571
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,220
You raped me.

572
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,100
I'll show you.

573
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,620
I'll show you what it
feels like to be violated.

574
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,820
My parents used to have these.

575
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,980
The Vietnamese invented this.

576
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,220
I learned about it in school.

577
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,340
No. No.

578
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,140
Oh, God!

579
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,460
Damn it!

580
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,340
God! Fuck!

581
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,980
Damn it!

582
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,020
Oh, God!

583
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,340
Fuck!

584
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,540
No.

585
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,500
- Fuck!
- Stay with me.

586
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,180
Stay with me now.

587
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,340
Sam!

588
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,060
Sam left you.

589
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,020
I had the craziest
fucking dream last night.

590
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,180
This morning, I guess.

591
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,940
Christ, will you just go talk to her?

592
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,740
You've been staring at that girl
for three freaking years now, Don,

593
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,340
and in that time, you've said what?

594
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,060
I don't know. 17 words to her.

595
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,580
- I...
- Sad, man.

596
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,140
Sad.

597
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,020
That's the girl in my dream.

598
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,380
You didn't just say that.

599
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,380
<i>No. No. I. It's...</i>

600
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,060
We know. The girl of your dreams.

601
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,100
Stop obsessing, Debbie Gibson.

602
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,100
Yeah. Snagged.

603
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,420
Okay, I gotta drain the tank.

604
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,140
Can I get another juice?

605
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,900
Sure.

606
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,780
Stupid mushrooms.

607
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,780
Awesome.

608
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,420
You're a freaking genius.

609
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,020
What?

610
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,340
You're staring.

611
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,780
What?

612
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,020
I'm sorry.

613
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,060
Just thinking.

614
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,140
We always fight.

615
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,020
You always start them.

616
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,740
Don't you realize
how perfect things could be

617
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,460
if you'd just, you know...

618
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,180
What?

619
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:44,940
You were in the middle of saying
something earth. Shattering.

620
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,740
Yeah. I was.

621
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,340
You can be such a pillowcase, Don.

622
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,580
What are you doing?

623
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,700
Hello.

624
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,900
Yeah. Hi, Mom.

625
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,700
Wait, wait, wait. Just stop.

626
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,780
No, don't touch anything.

627
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,900
I'll come and help you.
Just don't touch anything else.

628
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,660
Okay.

629
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,180
I just got my mom a new Mac.

630
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,980
Go help your mom, Don.

631
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,420
We can finish this stuff
tomorrow morning.

632
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,300
Hey, you still having
that thing on Friday?

633
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,420
The mix isn't ready.

634
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,180
You know,
problem with the studio.

635
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,060
I'll let you know
as soon as I reschedule.

636
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,100
All right? I'll...

637
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,020
see you later.

638
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,100
Don!

639
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,740
On, God, no.

640
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,980
No, no, no, no. Leave her alone.

641
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,900
Please.

642
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,860
It's the funniest story.

643
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,860
Oh, hi.

644
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,340
Hello.

645
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,140
Don's expecting me.

646
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,060
Come on in.

647
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,100
I was just gonna make some tea,
and then we can go downstairs.

648
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,900
I'm just helping Don
with some recording stuff.

649
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,260
Oh, okay.

650
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,540
Sorry. My feet are killing me.

651
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,420
Don't be silly. Relax.

652
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,220
I'm Christine, by the way.

653
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,260
Elizabeth.

654
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,060
So has Don been working all day?

655
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,100
Oh, yeah. Since pretty early.

656
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,180
He gets really
into his work, you know.

657
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,460
Well, that's good.

658
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,940
Good for him.

659
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,940
How are you liking it?

660
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,980
I've been having
a lot of fun down there.

661
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,340
Really.

662
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,780
Come on, Elizabeth.

663
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,860
He talks about you all the time.

664
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,500
He does?

665
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,900
I probably shouldn't have said that.

666
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,060
But you did.

667
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,060
What does he say?

668
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:41,540
He says you're the one who got away.

669
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,020
Should've chased after you.

670
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,260
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.

671
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,940
You didn't.

672
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,020
It's been a long day.

673
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,380
I'll say.

674
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,020
- I got your text.
- Oh, shut up.

675
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,580
No.

676
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,060
If you hurt her, asshole,

677
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,220
I will fucking kill you.

678
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,420
Please...

679
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,100
Oh, yeah. What's this for?

680
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,820
What are you allergic to?

681
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,060
For God sakes!

682
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,340
Fuck! Fuck!

683
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,940
Peanuts!

684
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,580
Peanuts, for God sakes! God!

685
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,940
Fuck!

686
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:17,420
Seriously, dude, was that so hard?

687
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,500
Why are you doing this?

688
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,620
You need to stop screaming.

689
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,700
Help!

690
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:28,220
Help!

691
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,980
Help!

692
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,620
Go ahead and scream.
Scream your head off.

693
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,180
We're miles away from where
anyone can hear you.

694
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,660
Hey, you know where that's from?

695
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,260
It's from a movie.

696
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:49,140
Help!

697
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,500
Jesus, bitch. Figure it out.

698
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:55,020
This gray shit everywhere
keeps the sound down here.

699
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,020
Okay, I'm bored.

700
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,020
Let's play a game.

701
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,660
Hey, I know you.

702
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,660
No, you don't.

703
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,180
- I do.
- No.

704
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,300
You don't.

705
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,740
Oh, God! No!

706
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,180
No!

707
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,180
Don't kill Elizabeth!

708
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,620
Fuck! Fuck you, bitch!

709
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:35,340
<i>I'll fucking...</i>

710
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,220
fucking kill you.

711
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,700
Oh, no.

712
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,900
Now I want you to watch this.

713
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:59,020
Oh, God!

714
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:02,420
Oh, God!

715
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,820
Oh, God! Fuck!

716
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,620
Oh, fuck!

717
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,100
Wait, wait, wait.

718
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,100
Cut me, Mick. Cut me.

719
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,420
You know that one?

720
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:24,220
<i>I guess a Clockwork quote
might be more appropriate right now.</i>

721
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,820
Can you think of one?

722
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,580
Please, whatever
you're thinking of doing...

723
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,580
<i>No. That's Misery.</i>

724
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,660
I'm so sorry, Elizabeth.

725
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,180
I'm so sorry.

726
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,380
No...

727
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,620
"Pull off gray safety cap.

728
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,820
Insert flat tip on thigh. "

729
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,300
Oh, God.

730
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,260
Now, that got a little crazy.

731
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,220
Now, who the fuck could that be?

732
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,300
I'm sorry. I work here.

733
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:36,260
Are you okay?

734
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,780
I don't understand.

735
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,540
You're fired.

736
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:49,620
I'm beat.

737
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:53,580
<i>...notorious inmate Shawn Gracey
is still on the loose.</i>

738
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,220
<i>Gracey escaped
from this institution three days ago</i>

739
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,580
<i>and is still believed to be in the city.</i>

740
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,580
<i>If you have any info...</i>

741
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:09,820
I gotta give it to you.
You're pretty resilient.

742
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,020
How much more you got in you?

743
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,540
Enough.

744
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:15,780
Good.

745
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,140
No!

746
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,260
So you're having a party.

747
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,860
What time are the boys getting here?

748
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:38,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

749
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,180
What girl doesn't love a party?

750
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,420
Hello.

751
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,820
- Hi.
- Hey, worker bee.

752
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,020
Just letting you know I'll be out back.

753
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,100
Yeah, okay.

754
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,180
You sure it's an assistant gig
and not some slave racket?

755
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,500
No.

756
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,020
I'm happy to do it.

757
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,140
He say when he's gonna be back?

758
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,940
No.

759
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,700
Mike's coming over after work.

760
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,420
That's all I know.

761
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,500
Well, I pretty much did the inside.

762
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,780
I mean, I wouldn't
open up any closets.

763
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:18,180
You don't want anything to come out
and bop you in the head.

764
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,740
Mike's bringing snacks.

765
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,300
Then the inside's done.

766
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:31,540
So I guess we have some time to kill.

767
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,740
You know,

768
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:38,300
I...

769
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,060
could give you a sneak peek.

770
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:50,580
He gave me the key
so I could finish some stuff up.

771
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,580
He's gonna be a while, right?

772
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,380
It's your band.

773
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:58,580
Yeah, but he's weird about...

774
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,180
letting...

775
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,700
Limited time offer.

776
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:05,300
Okay.

777
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,900
Let's make it quick.

778
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,500
I can't promise that.

779
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,900
Hey.

780
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:28,220
Slow down, buddy.

781
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,820
Whoa.

782
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,660
Crazy.

783
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,420
Welcome.

784
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,340
After you.

785
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,660
Why, thank you, ma'am.

786
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,180
I can't feel my legs.

787
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,100
What are you doing?

788
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,620
I can't feel my legs.

789
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,340
<i>What are... Sam?</i>

790
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,260
Don!

791
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,220
Don...

792
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:26,660
Seriously, dude,
couldn't think of anything better?

793
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,900
Heavens to Betsy.

794
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,900
I wasn't expecting such a bonfire.

795
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,060
You do know where
all this is going, don't you?

796
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,180
Why?

797
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,860
"Why"?

798
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,820
"Why"?

799
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,980
Because...

800
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,940
Well, doesn't matter anymore.

801
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,780
I'm not retarded, I just act a fool

802
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,700
Hey.

803
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,780
You must be the girl.

804
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,940
- I am.
- I'm Mike. How you doing?

805
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:14,380
Oh, hey. Nice to meet you.

806
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,900
I made some drinks.

807
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,420
Mind telling me if they're too strong?

808
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,900
I don't think that's possible.

809
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,660
Good. My kind of guy.

810
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,780
It smells in here. What is that smell?

811
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,180
I tried to make some "ors devores,"

812
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,900
but the blue Hawaiians look
like they turned out better.

813
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,100
You gonna join me?

814
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,980
Yeah. Yeah.

815
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,220
And in the yard, I saw Sam's car
out there, too. Where's he?

816
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:42,820
Next door feeding the cat.

817
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:45,660
But Don's on his way, so...

818
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,980
Nice. Looks like you've
had a few already.

819
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,940
Yes. Started early.

820
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,100
Here is to a night to remember.

821
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:54,580
And to drinking
with bow. Legged women.

822
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,460
- Bow. legged women.
- Right.

823
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:03,500
You know, I'm sorry we didn't have
more time to play.

824
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:06,900
Yeah.

825
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,660
Think I used too much?

826
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,660
Mike.

827
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,500
Oh, no.

828
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,900
No, no, no.

829
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,220
You never told me
if you liked my outfit.

830
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:49,340
I made it myself.

831
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:54,020
God grant me the strength...

832
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,020
To do what, Don?

833
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,780
Give you the strength
to get up and walk out of here?

834
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:06,820
Grant me the strength, God,

835
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:09,540
to kill this fucking bitch.

836
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:25,220
Yes, God,

837
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,900
give me strength.

838
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,420
I dare you.

839
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:03,900
Would you guys like some?

840
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,140
I'm good.

841
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,780
Having a good time?

842
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:25,740
Pretzels? Pretzels? No?

843
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,740
- Hey.
- How are you?

844
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,380
Have we met?

845
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,380
Oh, no. I don't think so.

846
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,100
Don hired me to help with the studio.

847
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:14,780
Right on. Nice to meet you.

848
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,460
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah.

849
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,940
You have a little red
on your neck there.

850
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,940
I was printing shirts for the boss.

851
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,500
- I'm a mess.
- Well, where are those guys?

852
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:27,940
- Smoking up inside.
- Of course.

853
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,860
I'm gonna go find them.
I cannot wait to hear the record.

854
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,340
Oh, God. No. Me, too.

855
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,420
I guess they don't really
call it a record, though, huh?

856
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,420
Anymore. What do they call it?

857
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,420
<i>- You know what? I'm sorry...
- An album?</i>

858
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,260
Album. They were sending me
out for an ice run.

859
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,420
- I got to run. I'll catch up with you later.
- Wait a minute.

860
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,460
Don't let them make you
do shit like that.

861
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,460
You know what? You're so sweet.

862
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,580
- It's my job.
- All right.

863
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,940
- It's all good.
- All right.

864
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,860
Well, we'll talk about that
when you get back.

865
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,780
- Absolutely. Looking forward to it.
- Okay. All right.

866
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,020
- Okay.
- All right.

867
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,460
Hey, at least they caught
that asshole, right?

868
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:01,260
Now you don't have to worry
about getting killed in the streets.

869
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,020
<i>The... Who... What...</i>

870
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,580
The guy on TV.

871
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,500
The Shawn Gracey guy
who escaped from prison.

872
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,860
They caught him.

873
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,180
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

874
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,180
Great.
That's a good thing, then.

875
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,060
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

876
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,180
- Okay.
- Anyway...

877
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,900
- Yeah.
- Well, we'll talk.

878
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,500
- Yeah.
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

879
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,420
- Have fun at the party.
- All right.

880
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,260
Hey! Hey!
No, no, no, no, no.

881
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,540
Don't pee. No, no.

882
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:41,060
<i>Guys? Guys?</i>

883
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:43,020
<i>Hello?</i>

884
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,140
<i>Can't fucking see.</i>

885
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,500
<i>I can't fucking see anything!</i>
