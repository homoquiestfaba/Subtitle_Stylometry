1
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,571
Fred, you're home early?

2
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:46,945
Yep, I wanted to catch you
before you started cooking.

3
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:50,144
Wait till you see
what I brought home for dinner.

4
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,778
Fred, if you think
I'm going to stuff pheasant at this hour--

5
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:56,587
It's not pheasant and I'll do the cooking.

6
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:57,884
What did you buy?

7
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:01,761
A couple of dinosaur steaks,
New York cut, 2 inches thick.

8
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,067
They look a little stringy to me.

9
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:07,762
Don't be a wise guy.

10
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,132
They're gone.

11
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,036
You must've left them at the butcher's.

12
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,439
I tell you I had them
and then I came right home.

13
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,033
So how could I've....

14
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,437
What's that?

15
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:18,639
Barney, barbecuing next door.

16
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,579
How could those steaks disappear?

17
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,777
I swear I didn't stop anywhere.

18
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,812
What's he barbecuing?

19
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,083
Smells like steak.

20
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,020
Yeah.

21
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,390
And I didn't let this bag
out of my sight for a sec--

22
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,783
Steak?

23
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,829
Did you say "steak"?

24
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,226
What a sneak.

25
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,996
I just put that bag down for a second.

26
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:41,461
Hi, neighbor.

27
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:42,731
How do you like these?

28
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,603
Couple of dinosaur steaks, 2 inches thick.

29
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,172
-Makes your mouth water, doesn't it?
-lt does, does it?

30
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:56,049
Is he going to get a fistful of fingers
in that mouth.

31
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,777
Okay, wise guy.

32
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,186
-Hand them over.
-Hand what over?

33
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,282
Hey, let go of those steaks.

34
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,725
Okay, neighbor, you asked for it.

35
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,126
Fred.

36
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,866
I found your steaks right here on the wall.

37
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,333
You owe Barney an apology.

38
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,474
Say you're sorry and let me have them.

39
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:24,377
I'm sorry and I'm going to let you have
both of them.

40
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,141
What's that for?

41
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:29,616
That's for the next thing you do wrong.

42
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,722
It's ridiculous, that's what it is.

43
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,351
Two grown men
acting like a couple of kids.

44
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,720
They haven't spoken to each other
for five days.

45
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:42,526
I'm sick and tired of it.

46
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:46,056
I told Barney to go right over
and make up with Fred.

47
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,836
-What'd he say?
-He absolutely refused.

48
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:52,739
So I said, "I'm going to invite my mother
for a few weeks if you don't. "

49
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:54,910
Really, what'd he say then?

50
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,709
Hi, Wilma.

51
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,077
I'll call you ba ck, Barney's here now.

52
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:00,715
Hello, Barney.

53
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:02,683
I was just wondering if....

54
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,411
-How's everything, Wilma?
-Fine, Barney.

55
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:07,683
I'll go call him.

56
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,522
Fred, a friend of yours is here.

57
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:16,588
If his name's Barney,
he's no friend of mine.

58
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,131
It's all right, Wilma.

59
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,601
As long as I'm here...

60
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,298
...I'd like the return
of some property of mine...

61
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,271
...which certain people borrowed...

62
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,639
...but obviously don't intend...

63
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:29,142
...to ever return.

64
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,943
I'm referring to my ladder, if I may.

65
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:34,141
Of course, Barney, help yourself.

66
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,079
If he's no friend of mine...

67
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:37,779
...I'm no friend of his.

68
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,158
You did that on purpose.

69
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,451
So long, neighbor.

70
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:46,119
Come back, you coward.

71
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,925
Betty, you've been a friend of a coward.

72
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,192
I'll head him off at the pass.

73
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,360
Help!

74
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,436
Fred, are you all right?

75
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:06,837
I will be...

76
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,384
...as soon as I get out of this stupid hole...

77
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,352
...and lay my hands on you.

78
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,249
That's not a stupid hole.

79
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:15,051
That's going to be my swimming pool.

80
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,853
I don't care what it's going to be.

81
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,258
I'm going to sue you for....

82
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,856
Swimming pool?

83
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:23,159
That's right.

84
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,529
Swim parties, barbecues, water polo...

85
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:29,332
...you know, the works.

86
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,331
Too bad we're not friends anymore,
neighbor.

87
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,633
Maybe you're not my friend, neighbor...

88
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,305
...but I'm still yours.

89
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,741
-What'd you mean?
-Just this.

90
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,283
I'm going to show you...

91
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:44,842
...how you can get your pool for nothing.

92
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,011
I don't get it.

93
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,386
It's simple. Look.

94
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,391
If you build half a pool...

95
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,087
...and somebody gives you
the other half free...

96
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:55,096
-Yeah.
-...you'll get your half for nothing, right?

97
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:59,026
-But who's giving me the other half free?
-Who?

98
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,631
Who is your bosom buddy...

99
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:05,503
...close pal and lifelong friend?

100
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:07,567
How many guesses do I get?

101
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,975
Barney, you're looking right at him.

102
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,171
See you around, bosom buddy,
close pal and lifelong friend.

103
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:14,978
Come back here.

104
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:21,020
What's that supposed to be?

105
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,315
A diagram of the finished pool.

106
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:26,327
Now, this is how it works.
Here's your half...

107
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,920
...and here's my half that you get free...

108
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:31,432
...with a diving board at either end.

109
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,795
You keep saying I get your half free...

110
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,428
...but it's in your yard.

111
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:38,804
Well, without my half
you only got half a pool, right?

112
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:40,536
-Yeah, but--
-All right.

113
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:43,973
Look at the advantages of owning a pool
with somebody else:

114
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,446
You get all the expenses,
the chlorine, filters...

115
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:49,076
...the pool toys, the cranophrane,
the phorostein--

116
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,744
What, the what?

117
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,312
Cranophrane and phorostein.
You got to put it in every week, you know?

118
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,187
-Sure.
-And it all costs money.

119
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,454
We own the pool together...

120
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,152
...we share the cost.

121
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:01,091
We do?

122
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:02,825
And besides all that...

123
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,163
...I'm throwing in this little surprise...

124
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:07,302
...free.

125
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:08,467
For me?

126
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,062
For you, buddy.

127
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:12,674
"Do-it-yourself pool kit."

128
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,703
You're one of the good ones, Fred.

129
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,209
I'm ashamed of myself.

130
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:21,612
Some friendships are written in blood...

131
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:24,843
...but this one is written in water.

132
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,220
Water?

133
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:27,756
Pool water, that is.

134
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:30,648
Hey, that's funny.

135
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,327
Start digging.

136
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,660
I'm digging, Fred.

137
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:38,927
Look, I'm digging.

138
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,332
All right.

139
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,107
You have to admit one thing:

140
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:51,010
They've been getting along real great
since they started this pool deal.

141
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,976
Why not? Barney is doing all the work.

142
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,418
Four thousand more buckets...

143
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:00,387
...and the last one in is a hot potato.

144
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,024
Keep up the good work, Barney-boy.

145
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:06,584
You're almost there.

146
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,820
My half isn't even filled yet.

147
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:11,264
It's a big job, neighbor.

148
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,363
Okay, at this rate it's going to take all day.

149
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,564
No, it's not. Relax, Barney...

150
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,470
...because I'm going to help you.

151
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,139
-You are?
-Yep.

152
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:22,677
I'm going to get you a bigger bucket.

153
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,516
How do I look?

154
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,814
Très chic, sir.

155
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:38,686
You might say:
"Around the world in 80 inches."

156
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:45,732
It is très chic, even if I say so myself.

157
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,433
You think it's a little tight
around the middle?

158
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,402
No.

159
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,837
Snug, perhaps, but tight, never.

160
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,736
You have a handsome physique, sir.

161
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:56,843
Yeah, I know.

162
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,952
Barney should have it filled by now.

163
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:11,452
Swim parties, barbecues.

164
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:16,654
All through, Barney?

165
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,992
Last bucket, Fred.

166
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,663
Last one in is a hot potato.

167
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,331
Wait for me.

168
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:50,124
Out goes the bad air.

169
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,427
In goes the good.

170
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,859
We should've left them in for good.

171
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,529
Don't give me any ideas.

172
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,836
Out goes the bad air.

173
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:07,138
Wilma, when are we going shopping?

174
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,740
As soon as I serve his majesty's lunch.

175
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,344
He's dining at the pool today.

176
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:15,115
-Where's Barney?
-He's trying on his gear.

177
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,281
Gear?

178
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:19,259
He's going to practice
spear fishing in the pool.

179
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:20,690
Spear fishing?

180
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,293
I'll be right back.

181
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,096
I got to go feed the fish.

182
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:28,432
Where do you want it, Fred?

183
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,202
Set it down where I can reach it.

184
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:34,437
And remember, if you sink...

185
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,536
...don't let my best dishes
go down with the ship.

186
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,318
Take me to your leader.

187
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,316
Barney, it's you.

188
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,253
Did my spear-fishing outfit scare you?

189
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,487
Out of my wits.

190
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:57,922
Don't scare Fred,
or he'll lose his lunch and my dishes.

191
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,294
Hi, Fred.

192
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:02,364
What are you made up for?

193
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,403
I'm going to practice spear fishing.

194
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,906
You can't lose.

195
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,476
You'll spear them or they'll die laughing.

196
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:11,570
How does it work?
Don't point that thing at me.

197
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,978
-I'm sorry.
-It's loaded.

198
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,221
You're making it awful tough...

199
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,025
...to be good neighbors.

200
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,464
No use wasting the lunch.

201
00:12:57,326 --> 00:13:00,090
Charlie, how soon till quitting time?

202
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:02,259
Any minute now, Fred.

203
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:05,129
I can't wait to hit that pool.

204
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,429
And there she blows.

205
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,940
Last one in....

206
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,380
Now what?

207
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,144
Hi, Fred.

208
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,850
Grab a shoehorn and squeeze in.

209
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,286
"Squeeze in" where?

210
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:33,693
Neighbor.

211
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:36,925
You and me have to have a little talk.

212
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,469
Who ordered this pool full of people?

213
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:43,165
They're not people.

214
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,831
It's the YCMA.

215
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:47,670
-I'm letting them use it.
-You mean the YMCA.

216
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,176
No, the YCMA.

217
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:51,245
Young Cavemen's Association.

218
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:54,476
Hey, buster, you're getting a little heavy.

219
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:58,175
Last week it was the Boy Scouts.
Monday, your relatives.

220
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,451
Tuesday it was your club.
And last night the bowling team.

221
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:03,515
"And last night the bowling team."

222
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:07,025
When do I get to use my half of the pool?

223
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:09,390
You are forgetting, neighbor...

224
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,898
...that your half is my free half...

225
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,194
...and I'm letting you use it.

226
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,961
You are an ungrateful ingrate.

227
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,805
And there's only one way to handle...

228
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,502
...an ungrateful ingrate.

229
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,979
Is this any way to treat
your bosom buddy...

230
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:37,548
...close pal and lifelong friend?

231
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,623
Barney, you're right.

232
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,159
This is no way to treat a bosom buddy...

233
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:44,426
...close pal and lifelong friend.

234
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,093
This is.

235
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,574
Now what?

236
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,508
We're only gone a couple of hours...

237
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,104
...we come back,
and you've got a spike fence up.

238
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,773
It's simpler this way.

239
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,650
When he wants to use his half, he does.

240
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,351
And when I want to use my half, I do.

241
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,420
And right now...

242
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,290
...I intend to use my half,
with a fancy one and a half.

243
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:24,800
Hi, neighbor.

244
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:26,465
Barney, what happened?

245
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:29,107
I took out my half of the water.

246
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,109
Why should I fill the pool
for that hippopotamus next door?

247
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,212
Because the wife
of that hippopotamus next door...

248
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,587
...happens to be my best friend.

249
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:43,886
That's why.

250
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:48,091
The fence comes down
because the wife of that little...

251
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:51,257
...sawed-off runt
happens to be my best friend.

252
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,058
And another thing.
This constant quibbling...

253
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:56,627
...between the two of you
has got to come to an end.

254
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,964
Not a bad idea.

255
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:05,839
Where's Fred?

256
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,472
He's inside taking a nap.

257
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,246
I haven't seen him since D-day.

258
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,853
You mean "D"
for "Down-with-the-fence-day"?

259
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:16,914
You know Fred. He's decided:

260
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:19,483
"That pool isn't big enough
for the two of us."

261
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:23,295
Barney and his buddies are sure using it.

262
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,765
You know big, kind-hearted Barney:

263
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:29,131
"Sure, come over, use the pool."

264
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,332
"Sure, come over, use the pool."

265
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:36,275
Big, kind-hearted Barney.

266
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,138
Don't forget...

267
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:40,408
...Barney is having the bunch over tonight.

268
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,473
-I know.
-Does Fred know?

269
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,209
No.

270
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:46,618
If he asks, I'll tell him
Barney's having a pool-warming party.

271
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,780
"Pool-warming party"?

272
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,919
Sounds like the call of a male gripesaurus.

273
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,694
You bellowed?

274
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,199
I did.

275
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,200
I understand...

276
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,828
...big, kind-hearted Barney...

277
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,772
...is having a pool-warming...

278
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,034
...which includes using my half...

279
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,341
...of the pool without my permission.

280
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,147
You get the message...

281
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,379
...and I've got one for you:

282
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,575
I don't want any trouble.

283
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:20,650
You think I'd make trouble
for my bosom buddy...

284
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:23,021
...close friend and lifelong pal?

285
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:24,889
Is that what you're intimating?

286
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,451
No, that's not what I'm intimating.

287
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:28,996
That's what I'm saying.

288
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,089
Wilma, I'm surprised at you.

289
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,863
Why would I make trouble for Barney?

290
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:37,161
Just because he's been
a little unneighborly?

291
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,005
Just because he's a little ungrateful?

292
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,637
Just because he's the biggest rat...

293
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,008
...I ever met?

294
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,380
Don't be silly.

295
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:53,922
Hello.

296
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:55,314
Who?

297
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,353
It's for you, Charlie.

298
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,921
Tell them to hold it a minute, Mac.

299
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,296
Eight rock in the corner pocket.

300
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,426
He'll be right with you.

301
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,537
Ten rock the hard way.

302
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:17,642
Yeah? Hello, Fred.

303
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:19,271
Do you a favor?

304
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:20,513
Yeah, listen.

305
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,379
I'm playing a gag on a neighbor.

306
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,113
Remember the outfit you wore
at the Halloween party?

307
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,384
You mean the policeman's suit?

308
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,117
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,792
Bust in and give them
the "disturbing-the-peace" routine.

310
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,921
Yeah, no more parties or...

311
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,326
...I'll throw the book at them.

312
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,797
No, they won't know you.

313
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:45,965
You put on that phony mustache
and the big nose.

314
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:49,576
We'll have a load of laughs.

315
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,649
What are you up to, Fred?

316
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,551
Me?

317
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:02,021
What makes you say that?

318
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:04,585
I know you, Fred Flintstone.

319
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:06,183
Don't try anything funny.

320
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:07,728
I promise you, Wilma...

321
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:10,594
...if I try anything, it won't be funny.

322
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,361
Don't you realize...

323
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,834
...Barney is really
the best friend you've got?

324
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,895
With him for a friend
I don't need any enemies.

325
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:19,774
See who's at the door.

326
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:22,333
I don't get it.
Why do you always have to...

327
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,380
...stick up for that knee-high,
little monster?

328
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,848
"For he's a jolly good neighbor

329
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,249
"For he's a jolly good neighbor"

330
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,880
Remember, this was Barney's idea.

331
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:36,991
"For he's a jolly good bosom buddy,
lifelong friend...

332
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,220
"...and pal"

333
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,819
Happy birthday, Freddie-boy.

334
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,962
My buddy.

335
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:58,708
Come on, Fred,
make a wish then blow out the candles.

336
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,975
Okay, okay. Let's see.

337
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,209
I wish....

338
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,520
Quiet out there!

339
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:47,494
I got to get some sleep.

340
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:52,698
Ever since that pool went in nobody sleeps.

341
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:21,157
Okay, this is all-out war.

342
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,295
Yes, madam, we'll take care of it.

343
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,497
Yes, I know, sir.

344
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,567
We'll quiet it down.

345
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:37,143
I know you're a taxpayer.

346
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:38,837
I know.

347
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,611
Calling car 809.

348
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:45,787
Calling car 809.

349
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:47,247
Yes, Sarge?

350
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:50,323
Investigate riot at Fifth and Stone Canyon.

351
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:52,490
Right, Sarge. Over and out.

352
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,025
Let's go, Pete.

353
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,175
Barney to the rescue!

354
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,957
Barney is having a ball.

355
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,995
Looks like this pool-warming party
is coming to a boil.

356
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:32,500
All right, everybody, the party's over.

357
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:34,668
Let's quiet it down, folks...

358
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:38,336
...or I'll have to book you on a 407, a 609...

359
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:40,136
...and a 33-and-a -third.

360
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,766
We got a dozen complaints.

361
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,078
Swell job, Charlie.

362
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:45,010
Charlie?

363
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,809
Let's ham it up a little?

364
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:50,580
So, the party's over, big mouth?

365
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,145
Big mouth?

366
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,347
How would you like to take a running...

367
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,823
...407-and-a-half into the pool?

368
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:59,051
All right, wise guy...

369
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:00,922
...I'm going to run you in.

370
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:03,096
You mean, I'm going to run you in.

371
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,065
Into the pool, that is.

372
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,438
Fred, have you flipped?

373
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,134
Relax, Wilma.

374
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:17,140
That's no policeman,
that's my friend Charlie.

375
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,143
-Fred.
-Yeah, Charlie?

376
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,148
-I couldn't get the policeman's suit.
-That's okay, Charlie.

377
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,811
Charlie!

378
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,911
Who's that in the pool?

379
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,115
It ain't Brigitte Bardot.

380
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,291
"Disturbing the peace.

381
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,024
"Resisting arrest.

382
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,062
"Dunking an officer."

383
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:44,896
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

384
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:52,278
I didn't even have a piece
of my own birthday cake.

385
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,212
How do I get into these messes?

386
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,280
How?

387
00:23:58,153 --> 00:23:59,120
Fred.

388
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:00,411
Barney-boy...

389
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:03,883
...am I glad to see a human face.

390
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:05,788
How are you, Fred, old pal?

391
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,829
I'm okay, I guess.

392
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:09,921
Relax, Fred...

393
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:12,558
...we'll have you out
as soon as the judge sets bail.

394
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:13,532
Thanks.

395
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:14,899
Thanks, old pal.

396
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,528
And in the meantime:

397
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:18,664
"Happy birthday, bosom buddy

398
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,967
"Close friend and lifelong pal"

399
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:27,038
You're one of the good ones.

400
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:32,912
Thanks for bailing me out, Barney.

401
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,045
What are neighbors for?

402
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,084
Is Wilma still mad?

403
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,387
She'll get over it.

404
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,553
She gave me the bail money, didn't she?

405
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,354
Like you said, Fred:

406
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:45,831
"This friendship is written in water.

407
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:47,532
"Pool water, that is."

408
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:49,365
Speaking of pool water....

409
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:51,234
You mean "Last one in"?

410
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:05,046
Uh-oh.

411
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:09,847
Fred, I forgot to tell you.

412
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,485
I had to clean the pool, so I drained it.

413
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,075
Come on, Wilma, open this door.

414
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,224
"Meet George Jetson

415
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,229
"His boy, Elroy"

416
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:07,064
"Daughter, Judy"

417
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:13,171
"Jane, his wife"

418
00:27:46,982 --> 00:27:48,609
Well, here we go again.

419
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:50,914
Another night, another traffic jam.

420
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,248
Boy, this spaceway traffic
gets worse every night.

421
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,515
Looks like an opening up ahead.

422
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,520
There's another one.

423
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,070
Space hog.

424
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:14,806
I'd better cut around and try to slide in.

425
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:18,439
Sunday astronaut!

426
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,040
Yikes!

427
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:25,747
Hey, you!

428
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,650
What do you think this is...

429
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:30,851
...the lndianapolis 500,000?

430
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:35,261
All right, pull up.

431
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,462
What's your name, Speedy?

432
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:45,029
George J. Jetson.

433
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:46,472
George Jetson?

434
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,442
Georgie, let's see what we got here.

435
00:28:49,578 --> 00:28:51,341
Passing under traffic.

436
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:55,540
3,500 in a 2,500-mile zone.

437
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:56,515
That's true.

438
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:58,485
Et cetera, et cetera.

439
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:00,078
I didn't see the et cetera.

440
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,144
Well, watch it.

441
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,962
I'll call you back, Mother,
as soon as I finish my housework.

442
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,466
George will be home any minute.

443
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:15,366
All right, dear. And don't work too hard.

444
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,869
'Bye, Mother.

445
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:21,732
I might as well start with the vacuuming.

446
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:38,121
Now, cut that out!

447
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:46,099
It's always us careful drivers they're after.

448
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,299
You try to obey the laws...

449
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:50,902
...be courteous, and what do you get?

450
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:58,204
A ticket, every time.

451
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,475
I wonder what's keeping George.

452
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,020
He's late tonight.

453
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:09,685
Here he comes now.

454
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,251
Judy, your father's here.

455
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:16,523
Isn't it about time your friends went home?

456
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:19,761
But, Mom, Jet Screamer is singing
on television.

457
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,100
You know he's my idol.

458
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,262
Well, keep the sound down.

459
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,374
He's not your father's idol.

460
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,409
I guess that's all those guys have to do...

461
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,879
...give out tickets.

462
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:35,212
Why aren't they out chasing burglars?

463
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,478
What a way to end a day.

464
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,924
Why do they always have to pick on me?

465
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:46,126
The third traffic ticket this week.

466
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:48,890
Tickets, tickets, tickets.

467
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:57,496
This is more like it.

468
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:00,574
Hello, honey.

469
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,535
Bad day at the office?

470
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:05,937
Those three-hour work-days are killing me.

471
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:09,942
What is it?

472
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,417
Chinese New Year?

473
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:15,387
No, dear, it's a meeting
of the Jet Screamer Fan Club.

474
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,818
He's on TV.

475
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,484
Not Jet Screamer again.

476
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,721
I will not put up with that noise.

477
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:22,694
I want quiet!

478
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:25,795
Daddy, can we have a little quiet, please?

479
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,494
We can't hear the music.

480
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:28,467
Quiet?

481
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:30,164
I'll give her quiet.

482
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:36,306
Here he is, the star of the show:

483
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,413
Jet Screamer!

484
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:43,978
Baby, baby, baby.

485
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,710
Ah-ah-ah.

486
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,455
Everyone out there...

487
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,956
...turn on the anti-gravity floor and...

488
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:53,687
...let's do the Solar Swivel.

489
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:57,589
One anti-gravity floor, coming up.

490
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:05,702
"I know a swinging place

491
00:32:06,074 --> 00:32:08,201
"Out on the edge of space

492
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,770
"The band has got a beat

493
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:13,240
"That'll lift you off your feet

494
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:15,883
"You're dancing in the air

495
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,613
"But you don't care because
you're doing the Solar Swivel

496
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,147
"Beware

497
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:24,419
"Swivel in the middle

"Swivel on the bottom

"Go, Go

00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:36,431
"Swivel, swivel, swivel "

503
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,765
Those kids are goi ng to kill themselves.

504
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,239
But, George, dear...

505
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:42,343
...they like to dance to that music.

506
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:43,207
Dance?

507
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,475
All they're doing is wearing
their clothes out from the inside.

508
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,709
Music? You call that music?

509
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:51,252
George, when you play your drums...

510
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,287
...Judy doesn't call that music.

511
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:54,754
So, you're even.

512
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,988
I'll take the drums every time.

513
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,655
Where are you going?

514
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,696
Down to the corner to get some bananas.

515
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:03,390
But you don't eat bananas.

516
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:04,762
I'm not going to eat them.

517
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,393
I'm going to stuff them in my ears.

518
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:10,931
"Swivel in the middle

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,501

"Now you're doing the Swivel, baby, baby "

524
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,390
My, what a mess!

525
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:38,221
Have they all gone?

526
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,595
All gone.

527
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:41,932
That Jet Screamer's got to go, too.

528
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:44,028
-Where is Judy?
-ln her bedroom.

529
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,340
We're going to have a Daddy-to-dame talk.

530
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:48,973
Judy?

531
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:50,875
Just a minute, Dad.

532
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:53,509
Doing your homework?

533
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:55,675
No, I'm writing a song lyric.

534
00:33:56,218 --> 00:33:58,448
-A song lyric?
-That's right.

535
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,721
Jet Screamer has a contest.

536
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:04,550
If your song wins,
you get to go out on a date with him.

537
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,587
I can't lose, Dad.

538
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:07,650
Listen.

539
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,665
"Jet Screamer

542
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,307
"Through your jet black hair, hair--"

543
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:23,037
Hair, hair, hair.
Don't slip on all that hair oil.

544
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:24,009
But, Pops.

545
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,070
And don't "Pops" me, young lady.

546
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,378
Until you get back to
doing your homework...

547
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,179
...no more Jet Screamer tapes.

548
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:32,049
No more Jet Screamer pictures...

549
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,520
...and no more Jet Screamer anything.

550
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:45,600
Baby, baby, baby. Ah-ah-ah.

551
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,827
That's one down and one to go.

552
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,338
Honey, where's Elroy?

553
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:53,499
He's up at the playground, dear.

554
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,445
Elroy, time for dinner.

555
00:34:58,413 --> 00:35:00,711
Pop, do I have to come now?

556
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:02,142
That kid.

557
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,980
Yes, Elroy, it's time to come home.

558
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:07,949
So long, Irving, see you tomorrow.

559
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,355
Same time, same sand box!

560
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,194
What took you so long?

561
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:17,822
We were playing, Dad.

562
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,333
All right. Hop in the shower, son, and....

563
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:21,926
Playing what?

564
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,164
Writing messages in secret code.

565
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,206
See?

566
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:26,699
Let me see.

567
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:30,339
"Eep opp ork ah-ah"...

568
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,111
...in secret code...

569
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:34,043
... means " meet me tonight. "

570
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,847
" Eep opp ork ah-a h"--

571
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:39,614
Dad, that's supposed to be secret.

572
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,378
Now, wait a minute.

573
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:43,981
"Bloop baba bip, blip baba boop"...

574
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,526
...means "don't be late."

575
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:46,925
But, Dad.

576
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,956
Come on, supper time,
or "wham bam bop. "

577
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:52,563
What does that mean?

578
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,431
"Wham," if we're late for dinner.

579
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:57,096
"Bam," your mother's going to bop us.

580
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:02,207
What'll it be for dinner tonight?

581
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:04,643
-I want a pizza!
-Me, too!

582
00:36:04,713 --> 00:36:06,476
All right, to make it unanimous.

583
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:07,480
Okay.

584
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,743
One unanimous pizza coming up.

585
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,747
Now, let's see.... Oh, here's the card.

586
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,694
Elroy!

587
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:31,267
Can't you wait for the rest of us?

588
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,639
Sorry, Mom.

589
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:39,611
It's nice to have peace and quiet
for a change.

590
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:41,643
I had a talk with Judy...

591
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:44,514
...and that Jet Screamer is
finished around here.

592
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:45,678
That's nice.

593
00:36:45,754 --> 00:36:47,221
'Night, Dad. 'Night Mom.

594
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,520
Can you mail this for me, please? Thanks.

595
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,426
George, wouldn't it be funny if she won?

596
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:59,461
Funny? That's all we need.

597
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:02,602
I'm going to remove
all doubts from the matter.

598
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:04,995
George, what are you doing?

599
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,540
I'm removing Judy's entry...

600
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:10,271
...and replacing it with Elroy's secret code.

601
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:11,807
But why, dear?

602
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:15,850
Because with stuff like
"eep opp ork ah-ah"...

603
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,215
...we got a guaranteed loser. Get it?

604
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:19,378
Oh, dear!

605
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,422
George, isn't it late for Elroy to be up?

606
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:24,719
Let's see. What time is it?

607
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:25,953
8:29.

608
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:26,891
Thank you.

609
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,326
That's all right.

610
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,189
Elroy, bedtime.

611
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,195
And how are things in Outer-Plutonia?

612
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:37,336
Not bad!

613
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:38,736
Glad to hear it.

614
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:39,967
Elroy!

615
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:43,969
I got to sign off.
Old you-know-who is barking.

616
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:47,806
Talk to you tomorrow
on the 14 MGY aseloscopic.

617
00:37:51,653 --> 00:37:53,621
Faster, Bobby, can't you?

618
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,815
I'm already going over 1,000.

619
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,050
What's the big hurry?

620
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,593
My big chance is coming up on TV tonight.

621
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:01,322
That's what's the big hurry.

622
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,759
Judy, what's the rush?

623
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,531
They're announcing
the winner of the contest...

624
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:12,436
...on the Jet Screamer show.

625
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,468
Mother, I'm so excited.

626
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,875
Judy, you realize...

627
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,277
...chances are a million-to-one against you.

628
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:24,876
And now, the exciting announcement...

629
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:26,614
... for some lucky girl.

630
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:30,416
Remember, Judy, we can't all be winners.

631
00:38:30,492 --> 00:38:34,019
The winner
of the Jet Screamer contest is...

632
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:36,894
...Miss Judy Jetson!

633
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:40,092
I'm sorry you didn't win, honey.

634
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:41,830
Judy Jetson?

635
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,564
And her prize is...

636
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:45,265
...a date with...

637
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:47,773
...Jet Screamer!

638
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,077
Baby, baby, baby! Ah-ah-ah!

639
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,241
I'd like to sing the winning song...

640
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:59,980
...called, "Eep Opp Ork Ah-Ah"...

641
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:03,182
... which means, "meet me tonight. "

642
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:04,788
No, you don't.

643
00:39:05,794 --> 00:39:08,024
He knows the secret code message.

644
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,893
Mom, I won!

645
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:11,965
I have a date with Jet Screamer tomorrow.

646
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,762
I have a date.

647
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:15,994
I think I'm going to faint!

648
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,561
Move over. Make room for me.

649
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,438
But, George, "Eep Opp Ork Ah-Ah"...

650
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:30,484
...was Judy's idea in the first place,
so she won, anyway.

651
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:33,419
That's right, Pop.
She wrote it for me yesterday.

652
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,319
All right, Elroy, go to bed.

653
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,290
I don't think Jet Screamer
would care too much...

654
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,725
...about going out on a date with Elroy.

655
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,695
That's right. He's not my type.

656
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:43,856
You heard me.

657
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:46,127
I know, "Elroy, go to bed."

658
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:50,661
I still don't like that "Baby, baby, baby,
ah-ah" coming over here.

659
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,569
Now settle down, George.

660
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:54,966
He's probably a little shy.

661
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:57,534
A little shy in brains.

662
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,469
I just made up my mind.

663
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:00,878
No date for Judy.

664
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:05,348
Oh, dear. This must be him now.

665
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:08,354
Now, George, please try to be pleasant.

666
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,721
Baby, baby, baby, I'm here.

667
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,957
The star of the evening...

668
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:20,567
...Jet Screamer!

669
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:23,230
Jane, listen to me.

670
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:26,831
I want this bunch of phonies
out of here, right now.

671
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:29,239
Stand by for the television interview.

672
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,103
George, how nice.

673
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,346
We're going to be on television.

674
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:37,077
I don't care if we're going-- Television?

675
00:40:40,822 --> 00:40:42,653
I suppose you TV people...

676
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:44,885
...are always looking for new talent.

677
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,153
Sure.

678
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,621
"The rain on the plain...

679
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,696
"...falls mainly in Spain."

680
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,033
What did you say?

681
00:40:54,102 --> 00:40:56,127
"The rain on the plain...

682
00:40:56,271 --> 00:40:59,001
"...falls mainly in Spain."

683
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,039
I think we got a troublemaker here.

684
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,304
Which one?

685
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,245
The guy next to me
giving Spanish weather reports.

686
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,806
We're on the air.

687
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,010
Good evening, folks, this is Jack Star.

688
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:12,848
Bringing you a special treat.

689
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:15,754
The winner
of the Jet Screamer Song Contest...

690
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:18,121
...and her family. But first:

691
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:21,290
Jet Screamer himself!

692
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:27,427
Baby, baby, baby.

693
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,694
The winner and his date for the evening:

694
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:32,102
Judy Jetson.

695
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:33,763
Say something, Judy.

696
00:41:37,145 --> 00:41:38,840
Her mother and father.

697
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,513
Mr. Jetson, how does it feel
to have a famous daughter?

698
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:44,749
I feel, I feel, I feel--

699
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,548
-Thank you.
-I feel--

700
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,185
Back to the studio for an announcement.

701
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,452
George, are you all right?

702
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:53,426
I feel, I feel, I feel--

703
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:55,996
-George, dear.
-I feel, I feel, I feel....

704
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:58,724
One more, please.

705
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,596
Smile.

706
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:00,895
Hold it.

707
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:02,664
Jet, where you going?

708
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:05,896
Swiveling, boys.

709
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:10,034
There they go.

710
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,073
Our little Judy with a guy
we don't know anything about.

711
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:16,309
What's to get excited about?

712
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:18,249
"What's to get excited about? "

713
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:20,213
You know the old saying:

714
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,313
"When danger threatens the young...

715
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,824
"...does not the mother eagle
bare her claws?"

716
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:26,154
An eagle?

717
00:42:26,494 --> 00:42:29,122
You're acting more like a cuckoo bird.

718
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:31,389
George, now where are you going?

719
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,366
My daughter will have a chaperon...

720
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:36,232
...whether she likes it or not.

721
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,537
Baby, baby...

722
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,101
...how's about the Spaceburger drive-in?

723
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,447
Swell.

724
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:48,675
I never swivel on an empty stomach.

725
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:51,148
Whatever you say, Jet!

726
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:01,759
Sure is a beautiful car you have, Jet.

727
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,759
Cars are my hobby.

728
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,856
You see, I got six more at home.

729
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,701
I hate to eavesdrop,
but, after all, she is my daughter.

730
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,934
What do you do with so many?

731
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,570
I kind of like to keep
a string of beauties around.

732
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:20,739
You never know when you'll need one.

733
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:21,679
What nerve.

734
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:24,217
Bragging about all his girls to Judy.

735
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:26,343
A different one each day of the week.

736
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:29,948
I got big ones, small ones,
fast ones, the whole bit.

737
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,515
I like to run them
in competition with each other.

738
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:33,685
How thrilling.

739
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,158
"How thrilling?"

740
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:39,723
You must be the first kid
on your block to have seven cars.

741
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:41,162
Just lucky, I guess.

742
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:44,170
Hang on, baby, I'm going to put her in high.

743
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,440
Cars?

744
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:50,534
He was talking about cars!

745
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,781
Two burgers and two stato-shakes.

746
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:08,920
You having fun, Judy?

747
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,395
Gosh, am l.

748
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:14,089
Imagine me,
out on a date with Jet Screamer.

749
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:17,700
-What's up?
-Somebody was peeking in at us.

750
00:44:17,772 --> 00:44:19,740
Probably one of my fans.

751
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:23,277
-This one looked like my father.
-Relax.

752
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:25,538
I get them all ages.

753
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,452
Next stop, the Fun Pad for a few laughs?

754
00:44:34,122 --> 00:44:35,487
Whatever you say, Jet!

755
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:48,865
Ride the Rocket Chute?

756
00:44:49,504 --> 00:44:51,369
Jet, how exciting.

757
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,507
On the way up,
I'll sing you my new number:

758
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,407
"Marry Me on the Moon."

759
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,411
Marry her on the moon?

760
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:06,448
Follow that rocket!

761
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:18,258
Bud, you can't use this rocket.

762
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:19,958
It's in for repairs.

763
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,271
This is where I do
my swivel show, baby, baby.

764
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,571
"Baby, baby"?

765
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,544
I'll swivel him.

766
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,618
Teenagers only.

767
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,285
How old are you?

768
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:42,522
Seventeen.

769
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:44,557
Your suit's older than that.

770
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:47,685
All right, I'll tell you the truth:
I'm nineteen.

771
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:50,424
All right, blast off.

772
00:45:50,565 --> 00:45:52,556
Now, wait a minute. She's my father.

773
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:54,191
I mean, she's my daughter.

774
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:55,792
You can't stop me.

775
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,497
I'll try the back way.

776
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,805
"Band entrance."

777
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,384
About time you guys got here.

778
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:13,918
Hurry up and get on stage. You're late.

779
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:19,825
I'll give you $10 to take the night off.

780
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:20,918
$10?

781
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:23,964
For $10, I'll take the week off, man.

782
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:29,664
Baby, baby,
you're going to hear music tonight.

783
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:32,434
Fats Fanjet on the bass.

784
00:46:40,114 --> 00:46:42,048
Cool. Cool.

785
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:46,012
Sonny Solar, old "Hot Licks" himself,
at the piano.

786
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:53,526
Icy, lcy.

787
00:46:54,762 --> 00:46:56,127
And on the drums--

788
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,490
Daddy!

789
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,997
No, that's suppose to be Boom-Boom Basil.

790
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,628
No, it's my daddy.

791
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:05,203
What's he doing here?

792
00:47:05,273 --> 00:47:07,537
It's obvious. He's a fan.

793
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:09,469
Can he play the boom-booms?

794
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:12,239
No, but he can play the drums, a little.

795
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,402
Well, good.

796
00:47:13,481 --> 00:47:16,109
It's going to be a big night tonight.

797
00:47:16,317 --> 00:47:17,944
Hit that curtain.

798
00:47:20,488 --> 00:47:23,218
Hold it!

799
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,085
Tune in, swivelers.

800
00:47:26,193 --> 00:47:27,717
I've got a treat for you.

801
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:29,194
A new song...

802
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,821
...by Judy Jetson.

803
00:47:31,132 --> 00:47:33,430
To keep it in the family, on the drums...

804
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:37,232
...her father,
old "Space Dust Daddy" himself.

805
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:40,330
We're going to kick off with a drum solo.

806
00:47:40,408 --> 00:47:42,376
Go, go, Boom-Boom.

807
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:44,037
A drum solo?

808
00:47:44,312 --> 00:47:44,937
Who?

809
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:46,741
Who, me? Alone?

810
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,108
Sure, you.

811
00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:49,739
You can do it.

812
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,111
Go get them, Dad.

813
00:47:51,185 --> 00:47:53,050
Zoom, Dad, zoom.

814

Judy, you're home.

848
00:50:23,003 --> 00:50:24,561
Did you see your father?

849
00:50:24,638 --> 00:50:25,798
Did l?

850
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,207
I hope he didn't ruin your evening.

851
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,833
Did you have a good time?

852
00:50:29,977 --> 00:50:32,844
I sure did, but not as good as Dad.

853
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,346
What do you mean, dear?

854
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:35,814
Take a look.

855
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,981
Baby, baby, baby. Oh, oh, oh.

856
00:50:41,088 --> 00:50:43,921
Your daddy's home
and he's the star of the show.

What's that?

874
00:53:35,163 --> 00:53:36,357
A tree?

875
00:53:39,568 --> 00:53:41,365
I'll have to move it.

876
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:54,706
Well, gang, we're almost there.

877
00:53:54,783 --> 00:53:59,152
Isn't it a groovy idea holding
the school dance and hayride on a farm?

878
00:53:59,488 --> 00:54:01,820
I'll say, I can hardly wait to get there.

879
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,257
And I can hardly wait
to get my hands on the buffet table.

880
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:08,956
Just think, like,
real chocolate-covered corn on the cob!

881
00:54:12,701 --> 00:54:16,000
Hey, take a look at Scooby.
He's really slicking up.

882
00:54:16,071 --> 00:54:19,063
I guess he's getting ready
to put on the dog.

883
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:32,351
What's that?

884
00:54:33,622 --> 00:54:35,852
It looks like there's been an accident.

885
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:38,154
And there's someone laying in the road.

886
00:54:38,226 --> 00:54:39,750
It's a bank guard.

887
00:54:39,828 --> 00:54:41,090
Is he all right?

888
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:42,523
I think so.

889
00:54:42,597 --> 00:54:44,531
He's just got a bad conk on the head.

890
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:45,566
Like, wow.

891
00:54:45,634 --> 00:54:48,102
This is the craziest accident I ever saw.

892
00:54:48,236 --> 00:54:49,931
Not a scratch on the outside...

893
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:52,496
...but a real wreck on the inside.

894
00:54:52,774 --> 00:54:53,900
Wreck nothing.

895
00:54:53,975 --> 00:54:55,772
This car's been ransacked.

896
00:54:55,844 --> 00:54:58,472
Maybe the bank guard
can give us some answers.

897
00:54:59,681 --> 00:55:01,410
He's coming around.

898
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:05,878
The flame will tell the Creeper.

899
00:55:06,788 --> 00:55:08,153
The Creeper?

900
00:55:08,256 --> 00:55:09,348
Creeper?

901
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:12,757
Like, wow.
This is creepy. Who's the Creeper?

902
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:16,092
And what's with that piece of paper
the guard handed you, Freddy?

903
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:18,132
I don't know, it's blank.

904
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,663
Over here, over here.

905
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:22,626
Look at this.

906
00:55:22,704 --> 00:55:24,467
Like, Scooby's found something.

907
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:26,166
-What is it?
-It's--

908
00:55:28,677 --> 00:55:31,043
It's the bank president's address.

909
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:32,875
And he lives right near here.

910
00:55:32,948 --> 00:55:36,679
Come on, let's take the guard to his house
and get some help.

911
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:41,922
You did the proper thing
by bringing the guard to my house.

912
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,617
He'll be fine when he wakes up.

913
00:55:43,692 --> 00:55:46,320
Thanks, Mr. Carswell,
we knew you'd be able to help.

914
00:55:46,394 --> 00:55:47,486
Speaking of help...

915
00:55:47,562 --> 00:55:50,429
...the Sheriff's out of town
and won't be back for hours.

916
00:55:50,498 --> 00:55:53,934
Tell me,
were there any clues to who did this?

917
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:57,766
No, sir, but the guard handed us
this blank paper and mumbled:

918
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:00,538
"The flame will tell the Creeper."

919
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:02,634
Like, who is this Creeper anyway?

920
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:04,042
Yeah, who?

921
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:08,411
The Creeper is a mysterious figure that's
been robbing our bank in the dead of night.

922
00:56:08,483 --> 00:56:13,978
And each time, the doors and windows
are still locked from the inside.

923
00:56:14,155 --> 00:56:15,645
Then how does he do it?

924
00:56:15,724 --> 00:56:19,285
He's a phantom.
A phantom that can walk through walls.

925
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:24,195
Well, phantom or no phantom,
we got a date at the barn dance.

926
00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:27,564
Why don't you kids run along,
I'll take care of everything.

927
00:56:42,183 --> 00:56:44,947
This is a groovy dance floor,
isn't it, Velma?

928
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:45,914
Yeah.

929
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:49,286
Why don't you try dancing on it
instead of my feet?

930
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:51,625
May I cut in?

931
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:58,662
I've been a wallflower before,
but this is ridiculous.

932
00:56:59,301 --> 00:57:00,859
Hey, Scoob, look.

933
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:03,938
Buffet table at three o'clock.
Are you with me?

934
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:05,472
I'm with you.

935
00:57:08,743 --> 00:57:10,472
My favorite snack:

936
00:57:11,112 --> 00:57:14,104
Corn on the cob à la chocolate syrup.

937
00:57:39,341 --> 00:57:40,399
What happened?

938
00:57:40,475 --> 00:57:43,273
Cool it, gang. It's only a power failure.

939
00:57:43,611 --> 00:57:45,909
But what about our dance?

940
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:50,178
Velma's right, Freddy.
This creepy old barn is no fun in the dark.

941
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:53,186
I got an idea.
Let's all meet back at the malt shop.

942
00:57:53,254 --> 00:57:55,085
We can continue our party from there.

943
00:57:55,156 --> 00:57:57,954
Yeah. That's a good idea. Let's go.

944
00:57:58,026 --> 00:58:00,756
Scooby and I will head up
the cleanup committee.

945
00:58:00,996 --> 00:58:01,985
We will?

946
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:04,190
Clean up the food, that is.

947
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,067
See you at the malt shop.

948
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:14,775
Shaggy. Scooby.

949
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:15,935
Hurry it up in there.

950
00:58:16,344 --> 00:58:18,938
We'll be right out. Okay, Scoob...

951
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,015
...on your mark, get set, go!

952
00:58:25,687 --> 00:58:28,212
Pretty good cleanup job,
if I do say so myself.

953
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:29,620
Yeah.

954
00:58:30,725 --> 00:58:33,489
Now all that's left is to take
these paper plates out back.

955
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:37,864
We can dump them
by that ugly scarecrow, Scoob.

956
00:58:46,141 --> 00:58:48,302
He's for real, gangway!

957
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,940
What's keeping those two?

958
00:58:57,018 --> 00:58:58,610
Help!

959
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:02,717
Velma, are you all right?

960
00:59:02,924 --> 00:59:05,324
I will be as soon as I find my glasses.

961
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:07,758
What got into you two?

962
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:09,956
What were you running from, anyhow?

963
00:59:10,598 --> 00:59:12,190
Him.

964
00:59:20,742 --> 00:59:22,039
What's that?

965
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:23,667
That must be the Creeper.

966
00:59:23,745 --> 00:59:26,111
Paper.

967
00:59:29,084 --> 00:59:31,985
I think he wants that blank paper
the guard gave us.

968
00:59:32,053 --> 00:59:35,113
And I think it's time to leave.
Everybody, run!

969
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,792
What's going on around here?

970
00:59:40,862 --> 00:59:42,352
Run from what?

971
00:59:43,565 --> 00:59:45,362
There, that's better.

972
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:48,696
Paper.

973
00:59:51,473 --> 00:59:52,804
Wait for me.

974
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,971
Paper.

975
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,107
Like, let's get out of here.

976
01:00:07,122 --> 01:00:08,817
Paper.

977
01:00:46,661 --> 01:00:48,253
Paper.

978
01:02:02,103 --> 01:02:04,799
Wow, what a crazy way
to make a getaway.

979
01:02:04,872 --> 01:02:07,306
But at least we ditched the Creeper.

980
01:02:12,046 --> 01:02:13,604
Doesn't he ever give up?

981
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:16,275
Since we're chicken,
let's hide with the chickens.

982
01:02:28,096 --> 01:02:29,188
Is he gone?

983
01:02:30,431 --> 01:02:33,889
Wow, any longer under here
and my head would have hatched.

984
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:39,329
Speaking of hatching,
looks like that egg you sat on is hatching.

985
01:02:42,944 --> 01:02:44,536
Now you've done it, Scooby.

986
01:02:44,612 --> 01:02:47,206
That little chick thinks you're his mother.

987
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:53,417
You better set him straight.

988
01:02:55,156 --> 01:02:56,180
You....

989
01:02:57,992 --> 01:02:59,186
Me....

990
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:06,325
Oh, great. Now he thinks he's a dog.

991
01:03:06,401 --> 01:03:08,198
Oh boy.

992
01:03:08,936 --> 01:03:13,100
Come on, let's see if we can find the others
before the Creeper finds us again.

993
01:03:19,147 --> 01:03:21,445
Wow, that was some wild ride.

994
01:03:21,549 --> 01:03:24,882
I'll say it was, but at least that Creeper
didn't get this paper.

995
01:03:24,952 --> 01:03:27,978
What's so important
about a blank piece of paper?

996
01:03:28,156 --> 01:03:31,785
There's only one way to find out:
Solve this mystery.

997
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,494
Well, unless my glasses deceive me...

998
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:37,292
...I think we've just found our first clue.

999
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:39,230
A car hidden in the bushes.

1000
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,458
Let's investigate.

1001
01:03:44,005 --> 01:03:45,597
Did you find anything?

1002
01:03:45,673 --> 01:03:47,937
Not even the registration slip.

1003
01:03:48,176 --> 01:03:50,804
Hey, wait a minute,
there's something on the floor.

1004
01:03:50,878 --> 01:03:52,243
What is it?

1005
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:53,773
Negatives.

1006
01:03:53,848 --> 01:03:55,645
Torn-up negatives.

1007
01:03:55,717 --> 01:03:57,912
And there's something strange about them.

1008
01:03:57,985 --> 01:04:00,146
Well, one thing isn't strange:

1009
01:04:00,288 --> 01:04:03,985
Somebody doesn't want somebody
to see a picture of somebody.

1010
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:07,954
We'd better find Shaggy and Scooby.
Maybe they've found some clues.

1011
01:04:08,029 --> 01:04:09,758
That'll be the day.

1012
01:04:14,736 --> 01:04:18,035
Scoob, can't you do something
to get rid of your Chicken Little?

1013
01:04:18,106 --> 01:04:19,403
Yeah, yeah.

1014
01:04:35,523 --> 01:04:37,718
Don't look now, but company's coming.

1015
01:04:42,663 --> 01:04:44,722
Head for the hills!

1016
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:20,189
Wait for me!

1017
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:23,063
No sign of Shag and Scooby yet.

1018
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:25,362
I hear someone coming.

1019
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,907
I bet it's the Creeper.

1020
01:05:26,974 --> 01:05:28,999
Quick! Hide behind those trees.

1021
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,835
When I give the signal we'll all jump him.

1022
01:05:33,047 --> 01:05:34,708
Ready. Now!

1023
01:05:36,884 --> 01:05:39,045
We've got him. We got the Creeper.

1024
01:05:40,788 --> 01:05:44,087
Correction, we've got Shaggy and Scooby.

1025
01:05:44,325 --> 01:05:47,658
I know whose back you're on,
but whose side are you on?

1026
01:05:49,797 --> 01:05:52,265
Sorry, guys,
we thought you were the Creeper.

1027
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:55,700
Like, who do you think we're running from,
this baby chick?

1028
01:05:56,904 --> 01:05:58,496
You saw the Creeper?

1029
01:05:58,573 --> 01:05:59,505
Where?

1030
01:05:59,574 --> 01:06:03,101
There and there and everywhere.

1031
01:06:03,878 --> 01:06:07,336
According to Scooby, you've been running
into him all over the place.

1032
01:06:07,415 --> 01:06:09,610
Hey, get a load of these footprints.

1033
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:12,312
It looks like he ran right past here.

1034
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:15,651
I'll bet those tracks
lead us straight to the Creeper.

1035
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:17,884
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

1036
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:28,966
Like, couldn't we make better time
on the freeway?

1037
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:31,971
Oh, Shaggy,
we're not trying to make time...

1038
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:34,906
...we're trying to make contact
with the Creeper.

1039
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:38,041
That's what I'm afraid of.

1040
01:06:39,046 --> 01:06:40,809
The footprints end at this gorge.

1041
01:06:40,882 --> 01:06:43,009
The Creeper must be in that cave.

1042
01:06:43,084 --> 01:06:46,212
Look!
A rope and plank bridge over the gorge.

1043
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:48,486
Like, what a shame.

1044
01:06:48,556 --> 01:06:51,354
The planks have all been rolled up
for the night.

1045
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:53,654
Well, back to the old malt shop.

1046
01:06:53,728 --> 01:06:55,286
Not so fast, Shaggy.

1047
01:06:55,363 --> 01:06:59,823
Scooby can climb across the ropes
and unroll the planks for us, can't you?

1048
01:07:01,035 --> 01:07:02,866
Not even for a Scooby Snack?

1049
01:07:05,006 --> 01:07:06,405
It's a deal.

1050
01:07:14,715 --> 01:07:17,275
Go ahead, Scooby. A deal's a deal.

1051
01:07:25,226 --> 01:07:26,853
Attaboy, Scooby!

1052
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:34,061
Go, Scooby, go.

1053
01:07:35,536 --> 01:07:37,163
I knew Scoob could do it.

1054
01:07:37,238 --> 01:07:38,398
Me, too.

1055
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,840
Is this trip necessary?

1056
01:07:42,176 --> 01:07:43,074
Wow.

1057
01:07:43,144 --> 01:07:45,237
What a spooky-looking cave.

1058
01:07:45,513 --> 01:07:48,107
Like, we're in luck. Nobody's home.

1059
01:07:49,884 --> 01:07:51,852
Welcome to my cave.

1060
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,515
Who are you?

1061
01:07:55,756 --> 01:07:57,621
I'm the hermit of the hills...

1062
01:07:57,692 --> 01:08:00,684
...and you're just in time
to join me for dinner.

1063
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:05,965
I just lost my appetite.

1064
01:08:06,033 --> 01:08:07,227
But I insist.

1065
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:08,962
You must stay for a while.

1066
01:08:09,036 --> 01:08:11,163
It isn't often that I have visitors.

1067
01:08:11,238 --> 01:08:12,728
I can see why.

1068
01:08:12,974 --> 01:08:15,704
What do you think?
He doesn't look like the Creeper.

1069
01:08:15,776 --> 01:08:17,073
He looks worse.

1070
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:19,945
Well, that hermit disguise doesn't fool me.

1071
01:08:20,014 --> 01:08:21,743
I think he is the Creeper.

1072
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,445
Go on, take a taste.

1073
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,781
I insist.

1074
01:08:28,422 --> 01:08:29,616
You like?

1075
01:08:30,257 --> 01:08:31,622
What is it?

1076
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,121
It's the specialty of the cave:

1077
01:08:35,196 --> 01:08:39,292
Squirrel stew with pickled bat wings
and crabgrass roots.

1078
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:41,767
Here, have some more.

1079
01:08:41,836 --> 01:08:45,932
No, thanks. I just remembered
I'm on a strict squirrel-free diet.

1080
01:08:46,007 --> 01:08:47,031
Me, too.

1081
01:08:47,642 --> 01:08:48,870
Come back.

1082
01:08:48,943 --> 01:08:50,240
Come back.

1083
01:08:50,311 --> 01:08:52,211
Let's get out of here while we still can.

1084
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,215
Come back.

1085
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:04,617
Like, what do we do now?

1086
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:07,660
There's no doubt in my mind
that hermit's the Creeper.

1087
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:11,129
Let's get back to the Mystery Machine
and go for the Sheriff.

1088
01:09:11,966 --> 01:09:14,594
Boy, am I glad
we've seen the last of that Creeper.

1089
01:09:14,669 --> 01:09:15,829
Me, too.

1090
01:09:16,637 --> 01:09:17,934
The Creeper.

1091
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:19,399
It's him.

1092
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:21,541
Paper.

1093
01:09:24,545 --> 01:09:26,172
Back to the barn.

1094
01:09:27,615 --> 01:09:29,082
Here we go again.

1095
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,981
Don't let him get that paper.

1096
01:09:31,052 --> 01:09:33,145
Paper.

1097
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:37,322
Wrong turn.

1098
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:40,560
You wouldn't hit someone with glasses on,
would you?

1099
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:58,676
Help! Somebody help!

1100
01:10:04,552 --> 01:10:06,986
Watch it. Looks like I'm a goner.

1101
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,582
Sorry about that.

1102
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:27,073
How do we get down from here?

1103
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:28,836
We jump. What else?

1104
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:34,376
-Watch it.
-The paper.

1105
01:10:34,548 --> 01:10:36,106
Let go, that's not it.

1106
01:10:36,183 --> 01:10:37,980
Take that, you Creeper.

1107
01:10:39,553 --> 01:10:41,248
Scooby, do something.

1108
01:10:44,058 --> 01:10:45,787
Yeah.

1109
01:10:57,872 --> 01:10:59,271
Nice work, Scooby.

1110
01:10:59,373 --> 01:11:00,704
You caught the Creeper.

1111
01:11:00,775 --> 01:11:03,005
Now bail us out of these hay bales.

1112
01:11:03,077 --> 01:11:04,601
First things first.

1113
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:13,953
It's Mr. Carswell, the bank president.

1114
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:16,150
How about that?

1115
01:11:17,424 --> 01:11:20,450
I got your message
and went right to Carswell's house, kids.

1116
01:11:20,528 --> 01:11:24,123
Carswell wasn't there, but I found
the bank guard tied up in the basement.

1117
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:27,395
Old Carswell had a pretty slick scheme
going for a while.

1118
01:11:27,501 --> 01:11:28,627
I'll say.

1119
01:11:28,736 --> 01:11:31,534
Since he was the last one
to leave the bank every day...

1120
01:11:31,672 --> 01:11:34,038
...he would just fill his briefcase
with money...

1121
01:11:34,108 --> 01:11:37,043
...relock the safe,
and leave the bank as usual.

1122
01:11:38,813 --> 01:11:42,840
Then, later that night,
he would return disguised as the Creeper...

1123
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:46,849
... and make it appear that some sort
of a phantom was robbing the bank.

1124
01:11:46,921 --> 01:11:48,684
However, unknown to Carswell...

1125
01:11:48,756 --> 01:11:51,520
... the guard installed
a concealed infrared camera...

1126
01:11:51,592 --> 01:11:53,958
... which took a picture of him
robbing the bank.

1127
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:56,886
Then, when he found out,
he went after the guard...

1128
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,864
...to get the incriminating pictures.

1129
01:11:58,933 --> 01:12:02,061
And this is it.
We told Carswell about this paper...

1130
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:04,866
...and after we left
he must have figured out what it was.

1131
01:12:04,939 --> 01:12:07,965
And that's why he chased us,
trying to get the paper.

1132
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:09,134
Watch.

1133
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,700
The flame will tell.

1134
01:12:15,049 --> 01:12:16,414
There's the Creeper.

1135
01:12:16,483 --> 01:12:17,745
Well, I'll be.

1136
01:12:17,818 --> 01:12:21,219
You kids have certainly wound up
all the loose ends in this case.

1137
01:12:21,288 --> 01:12:22,949
Blasted, meddling kids.

1138
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:26,756
Now that we're rid of the Creeper...

1139
01:12:26,827 --> 01:12:29,921
...why don't we creep on down
to the malt shop and join the party?

1140
01:12:29,997 --> 01:12:31,988
-Like, I'm ready.
-Me, too.

1141
01:12:34,468 --> 01:12:36,595
We got one passenger too many.

1142
01:12:36,704 --> 01:12:39,764
I think you'd better take him back
to his real mother, Scoob.

1143
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:46,607
Bye-bye.

1144
01:12:58,392 --> 01:12:59,359
Oh, no!

1145
01:12:59,426 --> 01:13:02,327
Scooby's become a mother hen
all over again.

1146
01:14:43,032 --> 01:14:47,059
This picture is respectfully dedicated
to the scientists of our country...

1147
01:14:47,136 --> 01:14:50,537
... and particularly
to Professor Huckleberry Hound...

1148
01:14:50,606 --> 01:14:53,598
... who, armed only with
his scientific knowledge...

1149
01:14:53,676 --> 01:14:55,166
...saved this nation...

1150
01:14:55,277 --> 01:14:56,801
... from a terrible fate.

1151
01:14:56,879 --> 01:15:00,315
"Oh, my darling, oh, my darling

1152
01:15:00,383 --> 01:15:02,476
-"Oh, my darling--"
-Professor Huck.

1153
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:04,143
Howdy, Narrator.

1154
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:07,615
Is that experiment you're working on
top-secret?

1155
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,214
Shuckens, no.

1156
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:13,352
I was just, you know,
kind of mixing myself a chocolate sody.

1157
01:15:15,264 --> 01:15:17,232
And with my scientific knowledge...

1158
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,392
...I sure do make a doozey
of a chocolate sody.

1159
01:15:20,503 --> 01:15:23,131
That's nice, Huck,
but we want you to tell us about...

1160
01:15:23,205 --> 01:15:24,604
... "Operation Spud. "

1161
01:15:24,707 --> 01:15:25,765
Oh, that.

1162
01:15:25,841 --> 01:15:27,103
No, I don't mind.

1163
01:15:27,276 --> 01:15:30,370
Well, it all started on a little old farm...

1164
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:32,376
...smack in the middle of Idaho.

1165
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:34,808
They grow lots of things in Idaho...

1166
01:15:34,984 --> 01:15:36,884
...but mostly they grow potatoes.

1167
01:15:37,086 --> 01:15:39,384
Millions and millions of potatoes.

1168
01:15:39,455 --> 01:15:40,444
Oh, I get it.

1169
01:15:40,556 --> 01:15:43,286
- That is where the name comes from.
-That's right.

1170
01:15:43,492 --> 01:15:44,823
"Operation Spud. "

1171
01:15:45,428 --> 01:15:48,295
Well, these was mighty fine potatoes...

1172
01:15:48,364 --> 01:15:51,162
...and as we all know, potatoes have eyes.

1173
01:15:51,233 --> 01:15:53,224
But the strangest thing happened.

1174
01:15:53,536 --> 01:15:56,596
Along with his eyes,
one potato had a brain.

1175
01:15:56,672 --> 01:15:57,730
That's right.

1176
01:15:57,807 --> 01:15:59,775
This potato had a brain.

1177
01:16:00,042 --> 01:16:02,670
And pretty soon he started using it.

1178
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:10,141
The first thing he did was to sprout legs...

1179
01:16:11,287 --> 01:16:12,948
... then arms...

1180
01:16:13,422 --> 01:16:15,788
...and finally, a mouth.

1181
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:19,389
Then his little old potato brain
started to scheme.

1182
01:16:19,962 --> 01:16:23,591
He would replace the animal kingdom
with a vegetable one...

1183
01:16:23,933 --> 01:16:26,868
...and make himself King Spud I.

1184
01:16:27,436 --> 01:16:30,894
Today, the potato field,
tomorrow, the world.

1185
01:16:31,307 --> 01:16:33,332
Potatoes, arise.

1186
01:16:33,909 --> 01:16:36,605
No more will we stand for being boiled...

1187
01:16:36,745 --> 01:16:38,975
...mashed and French-fried.

1188
01:16:39,181 --> 01:16:42,912
We shall attack and win, win, win.

1189
01:16:45,387 --> 01:16:47,787
All right, you stupid potatoes...

1190
01:16:48,124 --> 01:16:49,989
...lie there like vegetables.

1191
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:52,153
I'll do it myself.

1192
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:54,128
I'll grow big.

1193
01:16:54,196 --> 01:16:55,390
And bigger...

1194
01:16:55,464 --> 01:16:57,022
...and bigger.

1195
01:16:58,033 --> 01:17:01,127
And, you know, that potato grew so big...

1196
01:17:01,203 --> 01:17:04,400
...he started to, you know,
attract attention to himself.

1197
01:17:05,941 --> 01:17:07,806
The spud is coming.

1198
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:09,970
Run for your lives. It's the spud.

1199
01:17:10,045 --> 01:17:12,206
-Help.
-It's the spud.

1200
01:17:12,314 --> 01:17:14,714
-Help.
-Run for your lives.

1201
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:17,979
And after knocking down
the Golden Gate Bridge...

1202
01:17:18,053 --> 01:17:20,715
...the spud ripped up
the main street of the city.

1203
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:25,020
Residents in the eastern area
are advised to evacuate immediately.

1204
01:17:28,397 --> 01:17:29,364
Hello.

1205
01:17:29,932 --> 01:17:33,129
Yes, this is
Professor Huckleberry Hound speaking.

1206
01:17:33,636 --> 01:17:34,967
The White House?

1207
01:17:35,304 --> 01:17:38,671
Gosh, sir, this is a great honor. What?

1208
01:17:39,508 --> 01:17:41,772
Not that White House...

1209
01:17:41,844 --> 01:17:44,142
...the white house
next to Schneider's bakery.

1210
01:17:46,982 --> 01:17:50,179
If you fellas think I'm the only one
who can capture the spud...

1211
01:17:50,252 --> 01:17:51,913
...I'll take the job.

1212
01:17:53,556 --> 01:17:56,684
It might be kind of tough finding that spud.

1213
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:58,784
He keeps moving around so.

1214
01:17:59,762 --> 01:18:03,858
That's funny, my motor's going,
but I'm not getting no place.

1215
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,333
Well, what do you know?

1216
01:18:06,402 --> 01:18:08,199
I'm gaining altitude.

1217
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:12,470
Now, look here, Mr. Spud.

1218
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:15,601
You put this auto down, right now.

1219
01:18:18,347 --> 01:18:21,646
You notice,
he knows who's boss around here.

1220
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,419
Okay, Spud, you've had your fun...

1221
01:18:24,486 --> 01:18:26,477
...and now you're through.

1222
01:18:27,089 --> 01:18:28,078
You hear me?

1223
01:18:28,157 --> 01:18:29,681
You're through.

1224
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,121
It's only fair to warn you...

1225
01:18:33,229 --> 01:18:36,255
...I have science on my side and...

1226
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,827
...all you got is muscle.

1227
01:18:43,672 --> 01:18:45,765
I didn't miss that by much.

1228
01:18:47,309 --> 01:18:49,539
I didn't miss that one at all.

1229
01:18:52,181 --> 01:18:55,082
That Mr. Spud is a goner now, for sure.

1230
01:18:55,384 --> 01:18:57,909
I got me a real good scheme going.

1231
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:00,812
You see, by lowering this lasso over him...

1232
01:19:00,889 --> 01:19:03,687
...I'll lift him up
and then kerplunk him in the ocean.

1233
01:19:04,093 --> 01:19:05,754
I got brains, man.

1234
01:19:06,095 --> 01:19:07,995
All he's got is muscle.

1235
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:14,396
Like I said, all he's got is muscle.

1236
01:19:16,138 --> 01:19:17,799
And here it comes.

1237
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:23,473
For a potato, he sure can run fast.

1238
01:19:23,779 --> 01:19:26,077
I'll hide in that hollow log up ahead.

1239
01:19:26,215 --> 01:19:28,649
He can't follow me in there.

1240
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:38,084
And for a potato, he blows real good, too.

1241
01:19:41,163 --> 01:19:44,826
I just got to, you know,
talk to the owner about this here chimney.

1242
01:19:46,568 --> 01:19:49,594
I skedaddled back
to my scientific laboratory...

1243
01:19:49,672 --> 01:19:53,836
... to work out a scientific scheme
to get rid of this ornery potato.

1244
01:19:54,076 --> 01:19:56,067
But, whilst I was thinking...

1245
01:19:56,145 --> 01:19:59,080
... that Mr. Spud
started pestering me again.

1246
01:20:01,483 --> 01:20:04,850
I can't get a lick of work done
under these conditions.

1247
01:20:04,987 --> 01:20:06,750
Now, look here, Mr. Spud.

1248
01:20:06,822 --> 01:20:08,881
You're getting me all riled up.

1249
01:20:08,957 --> 01:20:12,484
And when I get riled, I start running.

1250
01:20:14,363 --> 01:20:16,331
I'll head for my experimental rocket.

1251
01:20:16,532 --> 01:20:19,160
Safest place right now is on the moon.

1252
01:20:22,638 --> 01:20:24,503
Got you now, Mr. Spud.

1253
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,300
You're locked up
in my experimental rocket.

1254
01:20:27,543 --> 01:20:30,034
And you're just small potatoes now.

1255
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:34,906
He got the rocket started.

1256
01:20:38,854 --> 01:20:40,788
What a close call for you, Professor.

1257
01:20:40,856 --> 01:20:42,756
What finally happened to the spud?

1258
01:20:42,825 --> 01:20:46,124
Well, that rocket went into orbit
around the Earth.

1259
01:20:46,328 --> 01:20:49,354
And that old spud is now a "Spudnik. "

1260
01:20:49,998 --> 01:20:52,796
He's just about due to pass overhead now.

1261
01:20:54,603 --> 01:20:55,797
And here he comes.

1262
01:21:01,577 --> 01:21:03,909
Mr. Spud's got only one worry.

1263
01:21:04,012 --> 01:21:07,914
You see, there's a powerful lot
of explosives aboard that rocket...

1264
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:11,178
...and any minute now it just might--

1265
01:21:13,555 --> 01:21:14,749
Explode.

1266
01:21:15,357 --> 01:21:18,417
Well, we'll never know for sure
what happened.

1267
01:21:20,929 --> 01:21:24,023
But it is raining potato chips.

1268
01:22:02,471 --> 01:22:05,304
It's the night before the opening
of the tourist season...

1269
01:22:05,374 --> 01:22:08,673
...at Jellystone Park,
and at the ranger station...

1270
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:12,007
...Chief Ranger Smith
is busy with last minute details.

1271
01:22:13,682 --> 01:22:15,582
Hello, Ranger Smith speaking.

1272
01:22:15,684 --> 01:22:17,242
Uh-oh, the superintendent.

1273
01:22:17,319 --> 01:22:21,585
Yes, Chief, we're all set
for the official opening in the morning.

1274
01:22:22,224 --> 01:22:23,384
Yogi Bear?

1275
01:22:23,492 --> 01:22:26,188
He won't give me any trouble this season.

1276
01:22:26,361 --> 01:22:29,728
I warned him that the first picnic basket
he touches...

1277
01:22:29,865 --> 01:22:34,302
...he's out and I've got a sure-fire scheme
to catch him red-handed.

1278
01:22:34,369 --> 01:22:36,337
That's fine, Smith.

1279
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:38,370
Well, good luck with your plan.

1280
01:22:38,574 --> 01:22:39,598
Thank you, sir.

1281
01:22:39,675 --> 01:22:43,236
You better check the St. Louis Zoo
and see if they want another bear.

1282
01:22:43,345 --> 01:22:46,803
I promise this is Yogi Bear's
last season here.

1283
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:51,849
What an idea, me dressed up like a bear.

1284
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,218
I'll be able to keep a close check on Yogi.

1285
01:22:54,289 --> 01:22:56,655
And the first picnic basket he takes:

1286
01:22:56,758 --> 01:22:58,191
Wham, I've got him.

1287
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,854
Too bad they only had
a polar bear suit to rent...

1288
01:23:00,929 --> 01:23:02,419
...but a bear's a bear.

1289
01:23:02,497 --> 01:23:03,725
All except Yogi.

1290
01:23:03,799 --> 01:23:05,198
He's a pest.

1291
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,927
Now let's see how I look.

1292
01:23:07,436 --> 01:23:09,904
Boy, this'll fool Yogi.

1293
01:23:10,505 --> 01:23:13,531
It's just about dawn,
so I'll get down to Yogi's cave...

1294
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:15,304
...and be there when he wakes up.

1295
01:23:16,311 --> 01:23:19,246
I don't know how he does it,
but Yogi always comes out...

1296
01:23:19,314 --> 01:23:21,145
...of hibernation on opening day.

1297
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,183
It's uncanny.

1298
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:31,682
Wake up, Boo-Boo, it's opening day.

1299
01:23:33,095 --> 01:23:34,585
What's the matter, Yogi?

1300
01:23:34,696 --> 01:23:37,187
-Did you see a ghost?
-That's right, Boo.

1301
01:23:37,432 --> 01:23:40,265
It's all white and it looks like this.

1302
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:44,603
Excuse me for disturbing your sleep.

1303
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,034
Who are you, Whitey?

1304
01:23:46,241 --> 01:23:49,176
I'm a polar bear and I need help.

1305
01:23:49,277 --> 01:23:52,508
You need something,
you look kind of pale to me.

1306
01:23:52,814 --> 01:23:56,215
All polar bears are white,
so we can't be seen...

1307
01:23:56,284 --> 01:23:59,117
...when we hide in the snow
up at the North Pole.

1308
01:23:59,321 --> 01:24:01,312
Hide in the snow at the North Pole?

1309
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,455
Well, to each his own.

1310
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:06,093
But I got tired of hiding in the snow.

1311
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:07,992
Which is understandable.

1312
01:24:08,063 --> 01:24:10,964
So I came to the great Yogi Bear...

1313
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:14,901
...to learn how to live in a national park,
from picnic baskets.

1314
01:24:15,037 --> 01:24:16,470
How about that, Boo?

1315
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:18,471
I think I'm playing it real cozy...

1316
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:21,236
...and they know all about me
at the North Pole.

1317
01:24:21,309 --> 01:24:23,277
Well, as a displaced person...

1318
01:24:23,378 --> 01:24:26,347
...you're welcome to share our lot
in Jellystone Park.

1319
01:24:26,682 --> 01:24:29,515
But, as wards of the federal government...

1320
01:24:29,785 --> 01:24:32,310
...there are certain rules we must live by.

1321
01:24:32,387 --> 01:24:33,786
Yes, I know.

1322
01:24:33,922 --> 01:24:36,652
-Bears are not allowed in cabins.
-Check.

1323
01:24:36,725 --> 01:24:40,252
They must never stop cars on highways
and beg for food.

1324
01:24:40,328 --> 01:24:41,124
Check.

1325
01:24:41,196 --> 01:24:43,357
-They must obey the ranger.
-Check.

1326
01:24:43,465 --> 01:24:46,093
And never filch picnic baskets.

1327
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:47,465
Right, Yogi?

1328
01:24:47,936 --> 01:24:49,403
Double check.

1329
01:24:49,504 --> 01:24:51,165
Now, who do I know...

1330
01:24:51,339 --> 01:24:55,105
...who'd go up to the North Pole
and shoot off his mouth about me?

1331
01:24:55,577 --> 01:24:58,808
Okay, Whitey, if you'll wait outside
for a couple of minutes...

1332
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:02,177
...Boo-Boo and I will join you
and show you around the park.

1333
01:25:02,317 --> 01:25:04,649
Fine, see you outside.

1334
01:25:06,655 --> 01:25:08,088
Fooled him completely.

1335
01:25:08,156 --> 01:25:12,217
An animal's intellect can never compete
with the brain of a smart human.

1336
01:25:12,427 --> 01:25:14,987
There's something fishy about this Whitey.

1337
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,164
But he's so friendly, Yogi...

1338
01:25:17,265 --> 01:25:19,290
...he's smiling all the time.

1339
01:25:19,634 --> 01:25:23,070
That's it, Boo,
he's too friendly and he knows too much.

1340
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:26,340
I just don't trust anyone
who smiles all the time...

1341
01:25:26,408 --> 01:25:28,968
...and talks without moving his mouth.

1342
01:25:29,344 --> 01:25:31,244
I think he's a nice bear.

1343
01:25:31,346 --> 01:25:33,814
I'll go outside and keep him company.

1344
01:25:35,851 --> 01:25:38,479
It sure gets hot in this bear suit.

1345
01:25:38,887 --> 01:25:40,582
Oh, my gosh!

1346
01:25:42,023 --> 01:25:45,459
That bear Whitey,
he swallowed Mr. Ranger.

1347
01:25:45,527 --> 01:25:48,985
I saw him open his mouth
and Mr. Ranger was inside.

1348
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:51,231
The ranger inside?

1349
01:25:51,299 --> 01:25:52,789
I get the picture.

1350
01:25:53,034 --> 01:25:55,298
Boo-Boo, little buddy, don't say anything.

1351
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:58,002
The old master will take care of this.

1352
01:25:58,607 --> 01:26:03,567
Okay, Whitey, let's take a tour
through the park. You'll like it here.

1353
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:06,670
Nice scenery and nice people come here.

1354
01:26:06,948 --> 01:26:09,178
Yogi, how about Mr. Ranger?

1355
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:11,811
Oh, yes, Mr. Ranger.

1356
01:26:11,987 --> 01:26:14,353
You'll like him, Whitey. He's the greatest.

1357
01:26:14,422 --> 01:26:15,354
He is?

1358
01:26:15,423 --> 01:26:17,983
Jellystone wouldn't be Jellystone
without him.

1359
01:26:18,059 --> 01:26:19,151
What a guy.

1360
01:26:19,227 --> 01:26:20,922
Let's go look at the geysers.

1361
01:26:20,996 --> 01:26:24,261
No, tell me more about the ranger.

1362
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:27,100
-The ranger is my friend.
-Hold it, Boo.

1363
01:26:27,435 --> 01:26:29,062
He's all the animals' friend.

1364
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:32,672
We all respect him
as the brave handsome woodsman he is.

1365
01:26:32,741 --> 01:26:33,901
No kidding?

1366
01:26:33,975 --> 01:26:35,306
He isn't a crank?

1367
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:36,672
Far from it.

1368
01:26:36,745 --> 01:26:39,179
He has his rules, but that's his job...

1369
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:42,148
-...and we do our best to obey.
-More.

1370
01:26:42,217 --> 01:26:44,447
He sounds like a swell fellow.

1371
01:26:44,586 --> 01:26:47,180
Mr. Ranger has
a great sense of humor, too.

1372
01:26:48,156 --> 01:26:49,817
Gives us a lot of laughs.

1373
01:26:49,925 --> 01:26:52,951
Could it be that I've misunderstood
Yogi all this time?

1374
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:55,889
He's a tricky one, but I'll test him.

1375
01:26:56,565 --> 01:26:59,466
Look, Yogi, a picnic basket.

1376
01:26:59,601 --> 01:27:01,728
I'll bet it's full of nice goodies.

1377
01:27:01,803 --> 01:27:03,464
That doesn't interest me, Whitey.

1378
01:27:03,672 --> 01:27:06,038
I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot goodie...

1379
01:27:06,107 --> 01:27:09,406
...pole, and besides, it's against the rules.

1380
01:27:09,678 --> 01:27:13,739
I use to filch an occasional olive,
but that's all past.

1381
01:27:14,249 --> 01:27:15,876
I've turned over a new leaf.

1382
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:18,317
Never mind leaves, get a sandwich.

1383
01:27:18,386 --> 01:27:21,651
Go on,
let's see if you have your old cunning yet.

1384
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:25,221
Well, okay, but just this once.

1385
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,786
The minute he puts his hand
on that basket, I've got him.

1386
01:27:28,997 --> 01:27:31,625
Looks like it's chock-full of goodies.

1387
01:27:34,736 --> 01:27:37,671
No, I can't do it, I can't do it.

1388
01:27:37,839 --> 01:27:40,501
I'd be breaking one of the ranger's rules.

1389
01:27:40,775 --> 01:27:42,106
Please don't make me.

1390
01:27:42,177 --> 01:27:44,008
I can't let the ranger down.

1391
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,014
He's our best friend. The very best.

1392
01:27:47,082 --> 01:27:50,313
Yogi, look, it's me, Mr. Ranger.

1393
01:27:50,552 --> 01:27:52,417
Mr. Ranger, sir.

1394
01:27:54,823 --> 01:27:56,654
Oh, my gosh, he's fainted.

1395
01:27:56,725 --> 01:27:58,522
Go quick, Boo, get some water.

1396
01:27:58,593 --> 01:28:01,687
Gosh, I don't understand what's going on.

1397
01:28:01,763 --> 01:28:04,527
There, there, Yogi, it was me all the time.

1398
01:28:04,599 --> 01:28:07,159
I was just testing you.

1399
01:28:07,235 --> 01:28:08,862
Did I pass, sir?

1400
01:28:08,937 --> 01:28:11,030
With flying colors, Yogi.

1401
01:28:11,172 --> 01:28:13,732
I'll get out of this hot suit, and, Yogi...

1402
01:28:13,808 --> 01:28:16,902
...you're going to have a nice pie
from the picnic basket.

1403
01:28:16,978 --> 01:28:21,039
Say, Whitey was Mr. Ranger all the time.

1404
01:28:21,516 --> 01:28:23,245
Here, Yogi, have a bite to eat.

1405
01:28:23,318 --> 01:28:24,717
I don't know, sir.

1406
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:28,448
My appetite suffers
when I'm emotionally upset.

1407
01:28:28,957 --> 01:28:31,687
But if you'll force-feed me...

1408
01:28:31,927 --> 01:28:34,122
...I'll try to choke it down.

1409
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:36,823
Well, now I've seen everything.

1410
01:28:37,132 --> 01:28:39,726
Mr. Ranger feeding Yogi Bear.

1411
01:28:40,001 --> 01:28:41,992
That's good, now have another bite.

1412
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:43,469
Go on, go on.

1413
01:28:43,538 --> 01:28:45,165
Thank you, sir.

1414
01:29:22,077 --> 01:29:24,671
-Hurry, Pixie.
-I am, I am, Dixie.

1415
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:28,249
I will get you meeces...

1416
01:29:28,316 --> 01:29:31,342
...and I'll batten down your hatches, like.

1417
01:29:32,921 --> 01:29:34,718
I'm so vicious today.

1418
01:29:35,057 --> 01:29:36,820
I scare myself, like.

1419
01:29:37,592 --> 01:29:39,492
Head for the mousehole, Pixie.

1420
01:29:39,561 --> 01:29:41,825
We'll never make it, Dixie.

1421
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:47,794
Hey, Jinksy, you all right?

1422
01:29:48,203 --> 01:29:49,830
Wake up, Jinks.

1423
01:29:51,073 --> 01:29:53,974
Do you think old Jinksy
has kicked the bucket?

1424
01:29:54,309 --> 01:29:55,640
Let's see.

1425
01:29:55,744 --> 01:29:56,642
Out.

1426
01:29:56,711 --> 01:29:58,645
It doesn't say when he'll return.

1427
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:01,442
-We ought to do something.
-Yeah, we should.

1428
01:30:01,783 --> 01:30:04,274
Let's get some cheese
out of the refrigerator.

1429
01:30:04,352 --> 01:30:06,820
-Well, how will that help?
-lt'll help me.

1430
01:30:06,888 --> 01:30:08,253
I'm hungry.

1431
01:30:15,263 --> 01:30:16,753
Mr. Jinks.

1432
01:30:16,832 --> 01:30:17,958
Speaking.

1433
01:30:18,033 --> 01:30:20,524
You are at the crossroad of your life.

1434
01:30:20,602 --> 01:30:21,398
Oh, boy.

1435
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:23,233
Your past behavior...

1436
01:30:23,405 --> 01:30:25,839
...will determine if you will go up...

1437
01:30:28,443 --> 01:30:29,842
...or down.

1438
01:30:30,679 --> 01:30:32,442
Let's look at your record.

1439
01:30:32,514 --> 01:30:33,606
Okay.

1440
01:30:34,349 --> 01:30:35,407
How is it?

1441
01:30:35,584 --> 01:30:37,142
Not so good.

1442
01:30:37,752 --> 01:30:42,018
Always making life miserable
for Pixie and Dixie.

1443
01:30:42,124 --> 01:30:43,022
I know.

1444
01:30:43,091 --> 01:30:46,185
But you'll get a chance to redeem yourself.

1445
01:30:46,294 --> 01:30:47,158
I will?

1446
01:30:47,229 --> 01:30:48,321
Go back.

1447
01:30:48,697 --> 01:30:50,995
And if you're nice to Pixie and Dixie...

1448
01:30:51,099 --> 01:30:54,694
-Yeah?
-... we'll talk it over again.

1449
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:55,934
Thanks.

1450
01:31:01,943 --> 01:31:04,070
Boy, that was a close call, like.

1451
01:31:04,913 --> 01:31:06,278
Jinksy is up again.

1452
01:31:06,348 --> 01:31:08,179
Head for the mousehole.

1453
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,013
Don't run, fellas.

1454
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,448
I'm not going to chase you.

1455
01:31:12,587 --> 01:31:14,578
I'm a different pussycat.

1456
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,755
I like you, like.

1457
01:31:17,325 --> 01:31:19,759
That sock he got seemed to change him.

1458
01:31:19,828 --> 01:31:21,625
Any change will be an improvement.

1459
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:25,265
Pixie and Dixie are my pals...

1460
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:28,029
...and I will be nice to them.

1461
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:30,904
He acts as if he's sort of, well, kind of....

1462
01:31:31,006 --> 01:31:32,997
-Nuts?
-Yeah. That's it.

1463
01:31:33,141 --> 01:31:34,267
Well, I'll check.

1464
01:31:34,776 --> 01:31:36,835
Are we really pals, Mr. Jinks?

1465
01:31:37,045 --> 01:31:41,379
Pixie and Dixie are my dear, dear chums.

1466
01:31:42,317 --> 01:31:44,877
And I will be nice to them, like.

1467
01:31:44,986 --> 01:31:46,419
Really and truly?

1468
01:31:46,488 --> 01:31:49,321
I love my little buddies...

1469
01:31:49,391 --> 01:31:51,450
...those cute little meeces.

1470
01:31:51,593 --> 01:31:53,185
He's getting sloppy about it.

1471
01:31:53,261 --> 01:31:55,889
-I think he's scared.
-Scared? Of what?

1472
01:31:55,964 --> 01:31:58,865
Scared of us, that's what. And I'll prove it.

1473
01:31:59,134 --> 01:32:02,001
Hello, cute mouse-type, buddy.

1474
01:32:04,372 --> 01:32:06,067
Why you little meeces.

1475
01:32:06,174 --> 01:32:07,869
I'll tear you to pieces.

1476
01:32:07,943 --> 01:32:10,275
-Mr. Jinks.
-Yeah?

1477
01:32:10,645 --> 01:32:11,805
Up?

1478
01:32:13,114 --> 01:32:15,105
Or down?

1479
01:32:15,183 --> 01:32:16,275
Yeah.

1480
01:32:16,585 --> 01:32:18,075
Remember?

1481
01:32:20,922 --> 01:32:22,150
He chickened out.

1482
01:32:22,224 --> 01:32:23,486
He didn't do nothing.

1483
01:32:23,558 --> 01:32:26,026
This is our chance
to get even with that big bully.

1484
01:32:26,094 --> 01:32:30,224
Yeah, chasing us and scaring us
half to death all the time.

1485
01:32:30,699 --> 01:32:33,167
I was only kidding, fellas.

1486
01:32:33,268 --> 01:32:36,704
Look, I just want to be your friend.

1487
01:32:37,239 --> 01:32:39,366
I love those meeces.

1488
01:32:41,743 --> 01:32:43,677
You sure you had enough, chums?

1489
01:32:43,778 --> 01:32:45,211
Yeah, for now.

1490
01:32:45,447 --> 01:32:48,644
Hey, Jinks, it's Pixie's turn to play cowboy.

1491
01:32:48,984 --> 01:32:50,008
Cowboy?

1492
01:32:50,485 --> 01:32:53,386
Oh, they are the cute ones.

1493
01:32:53,922 --> 01:32:55,253
Ride him, cowboy.

1494
01:32:55,323 --> 01:32:57,484
Yahoo! Yippee!

1495
01:32:57,592 --> 01:32:59,389
Faster, horsey, faster.

1496
01:32:59,461 --> 01:33:01,122
Keep his head up, Dixie.

1497
01:33:01,196 --> 01:33:02,493
Yahoo! Yippee!

1498
01:33:02,664 --> 01:33:04,291
Faster, horsey, faster.

1499
01:33:04,366 --> 01:33:06,459
Keep riding, cowboy, keep riding.

1500
01:33:06,534 --> 01:33:09,025
Okay, Jinks, take five.

1501
01:33:09,104 --> 01:33:10,935
Then we'll play space cat again.

1502
01:33:11,072 --> 01:33:14,166
Oh no, not space cat.

1503
01:33:14,676 --> 01:33:16,769
I hate that game.

1504
01:33:17,579 --> 01:33:19,342
Hey, cat, come here.

1505
01:33:19,414 --> 01:33:20,972
I want to talk to you.

1506
01:33:21,116 --> 01:33:24,108
What's, like, on your mind, dog?

1507
01:33:24,419 --> 01:33:28,879
That was the most disgraceful exposition
I ever seen.

1508
01:33:29,224 --> 01:33:30,987
I feel ashamed for you.

1509
01:33:31,126 --> 01:33:33,287
-But....
-No, buts.

1510
01:33:33,628 --> 01:33:36,324
Just stop letting those mice
push you around...

1511
01:33:36,398 --> 01:33:38,958
...or you will be eating your meals
through a straw.

1512
01:33:39,034 --> 01:33:40,399
You know, you're right.

1513
01:33:40,935 --> 01:33:44,098
You know,
I had just about enough of those meeces.

1514
01:33:44,172 --> 01:33:45,366
Mr. Jinks.

1515
01:33:45,707 --> 01:33:47,436
I know, I know.

1516
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:48,566
Up.

1517
01:33:49,744 --> 01:33:51,041
Down.

1518
01:33:52,881 --> 01:33:54,940
I got the message, like.

1519
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:59,252
Hey, Dixie, we're being invaded
by the monster space cat.

1520
01:33:59,354 --> 01:34:01,822
I hate this game.

1521
01:34:02,557 --> 01:34:05,958
I'll smash his space helmet
and he'll have to breathe earth air.

1522
01:34:06,027 --> 01:34:07,995
Then he'll be at our mercy.

1523
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:10,057
Give me that thing, mouse.

1524
01:34:10,632 --> 01:34:13,863
If that cat's going to let you
push him around...

1525
01:34:13,935 --> 01:34:16,495
...I might as well get in on the fun.

1526
01:34:16,771 --> 01:34:19,763
Okay, earth mice, here I come...

1527
01:34:19,908 --> 01:34:23,400
...to invade your planet, like.

1528
01:34:25,313 --> 01:34:27,474
Here's your hammer back, buddy.

1529
01:34:27,916 --> 01:34:31,579
I just saved the world
from an outer space invasion.

1530
01:34:33,154 --> 01:34:34,451
Stand still, will you?

1531
01:34:34,656 --> 01:34:38,524
How can we play William Tell
if you keep giggling the apple?

1532
01:34:39,561 --> 01:34:42,894
These mice are real cute buddies.

1533
01:34:46,368 --> 01:34:49,496
When I plays, I plays hard.

1534
01:34:50,905 --> 01:34:53,032
-Mr. Jinks.
-Yeah.

1535
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:55,109
Time to check in again.

1536
01:34:55,176 --> 01:34:56,404
Yeah.

1537
01:34:59,881 --> 01:35:03,214
Mr. Jinks, you have done well.

1538
01:35:03,284 --> 01:35:04,114
I know.

1539
01:35:04,185 --> 01:35:08,349
But, through a bookkeeping error...

1540
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:12,353
... we overlooked the fact that cats...

1541
01:35:12,427 --> 01:35:13,860
... have nine lives.

1542
01:35:14,729 --> 01:35:16,890
You have eight to go.

1543
01:35:17,132 --> 01:35:19,498
Boy, eight lives left.

1544
01:35:19,934 --> 01:35:21,629
Going down.

1545
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:29,275
All right, you meeces.

1546
01:35:29,577 --> 01:35:32,637
William Tell, like, you want to play, huh?

1547
01:35:35,016 --> 01:35:37,951
-Head for the mousehole, Pixie.
-I am. I am.

1548
01:35:38,486 --> 01:35:41,353
Don't you, like,
want to play space cat, anymore?

1549
01:35:42,557 --> 01:35:44,548
How about cowboy?

1550
01:35:49,097 --> 01:35:50,086
Who cares?

1551
01:35:50,231 --> 01:35:52,665
I still got, like, seven lives left.

1552
01:35:54,202 --> 01:35:58,400
And I'm spending all seven
chasing you meeces.

1553
01:37:00,568 --> 01:37:04,060
Step right up, folks! This is it.
The big time in the big top.

1554
01:37:04,138 --> 01:37:07,437
Where, for a slight fee,
you'll see right before your very eyes...

1555
01:37:07,508 --> 01:37:11,501
...the most daring, unbelievable
high trapeze act ever attempted.

1556
01:37:11,579 --> 01:37:16,312
I call your attention to stage right
for the start of this death-defying act.

1557
01:37:16,884 --> 01:37:20,411
Nobody said anything
about defying no death to me.

1558
01:37:20,488 --> 01:37:25,050
This brave performer will swing
across the street, catch his partner...

1559
01:37:25,126 --> 01:37:27,720
...and swing back, all without a net.

1560
01:37:27,829 --> 01:37:29,023
Now he tells me.

1561
01:37:29,163 --> 01:37:31,631
Okay, maestro, if you please.

1562
01:37:31,833 --> 01:37:32,993
Right.

1563
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:38,534
What's that crowd doing in the alley?

1564
01:37:38,606 --> 01:37:40,665
Top Cat must be up to something.

1565
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:44,572
The least he could have done
was let us rehearse this once.

1566
01:37:46,748 --> 01:37:50,616
Five hundred alleys in New York,
and I got to have one with a nut in it.

1567
01:37:50,818 --> 01:37:52,115
What in the....

1568
01:37:52,487 --> 01:37:54,079
Officer Dibble!

1569
01:37:54,555 --> 01:37:57,319
Excuse me, folks,
I got to go water the elephants.

1570
01:37:57,892 --> 01:37:59,359
I'm ready, Frank.

1571
01:38:00,795 --> 01:38:03,195
Officer Dibble, what are you doing here?

1572
01:38:03,765 --> 01:38:05,699
Everybody wants to get in the act.

1573
01:38:05,933 --> 01:38:09,869
Brain, I'm warning you:
put me down or I'll run you in.

1574
01:38:10,672 --> 01:38:11,570
Okay.

1575
01:38:16,678 --> 01:38:19,613
It wasn't much, but he sure is game.

1576
01:38:19,781 --> 01:38:22,875
That did it. Now I'm really sore.

1577
01:38:23,251 --> 01:38:27,381
Old Dibble is on the warpath,
and when I find that Top Cat...

1578
01:38:27,555 --> 01:38:29,420
...the feathers are going to fly.

1579
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:34,385
It's too bad, fellas,
we had such a good thing going.

1580
01:38:34,495 --> 01:38:36,122
Lots of dough rolling in...

1581
01:38:36,197 --> 01:38:38,722
...then Dibble has to play gangbusters.

1582
01:38:39,133 --> 01:38:40,361
He wasn't bad.

1583
01:38:40,535 --> 01:38:43,561
-Maybe we could work him into the act.
-No, he'd never go for it.

1584
01:38:43,638 --> 01:38:46,505
I got to think up some new way
to make a fast buck.

1585
01:38:46,941 --> 01:38:49,501
TC? What's a may-hay-ray-jay?

1586
01:38:49,577 --> 01:38:50,339
What's a what?

1587
01:38:50,411 --> 01:38:51,901
A may-hay-ray-jay.

1588
01:38:52,046 --> 01:38:55,607
Who do I look like, Daniel Webster?
I didn't write no dictionary.

1589
01:38:55,817 --> 01:38:57,751
Says here he gives away rubies.

1590
01:38:57,819 --> 01:39:00,014
Thousands of dollars worth of rubies.

1591
01:39:00,088 --> 01:39:03,455
Rubies, schmubies, who cares?
I got my own problems.

1592
01:39:04,392 --> 01:39:06,917
Rubies? Let me see that paper.

1593
01:39:07,295 --> 01:39:10,196
"Maharajah of Pookajee to visit city."

1594
01:39:10,264 --> 01:39:13,995
"Rich potentate famous
for giving away rubies instead of money."

1595
01:39:14,202 --> 01:39:16,500
This is it, men. Men, this is it.

1596
01:39:16,571 --> 01:39:19,404
Our ship has come in, loaded with rubies.

1597
01:39:20,608 --> 01:39:22,599
All right, everybody out!

1598
01:39:22,744 --> 01:39:24,041
This is a raid!

1599
01:39:28,382 --> 01:39:31,146
Fleeing the scene and resisting an officer?

1600
01:39:31,385 --> 01:39:32,875
You're asking for it.

1601
01:39:34,322 --> 01:39:37,189
All we want is a little peace and quiet.

1602
01:39:37,258 --> 01:39:38,816
You'll get it, all right.

1603
01:39:38,893 --> 01:39:42,556
It's very quiet in solitary confinement.

1604
01:39:44,866 --> 01:39:46,527
Interruptions, interruptions.

1605
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:49,069
If it ain't Dibble, it's something else.

1606
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:50,962
Hello? Who?

1607
01:39:51,405 --> 01:39:54,772
Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Will you call back later, Mac?

1608
01:39:55,610 --> 01:39:57,942
Hi, Dibble. Here's a call for you.

1609
01:39:58,012 --> 01:40:00,480
Part of my personal services
to a great guy.

1610
01:40:00,548 --> 01:40:02,038
I hope you appreciate it.

1611
01:40:02,116 --> 01:40:04,414
-Give me that phone.
-It's all yours, Dibble.

1612
01:40:04,485 --> 01:40:06,749
I'll take care of you later, wise guy.

1613
01:40:07,488 --> 01:40:09,615
Hello, Sergeant. Dibble speaking.

1614
01:40:09,757 --> 01:40:11,315
That's gratitude for you.

1615
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:14,088
I got to remember
not to send him anymore birthday cards.

1616
01:40:14,162 --> 01:40:18,098
I'm on special assignment
to guard the Maharajah of Pookajee?

1617
01:40:19,267 --> 01:40:23,704
I guess he can use some police protection
with all the jewels he carries.

1618
01:40:24,572 --> 01:40:26,767
What time is he arriving?

1619
01:40:26,908 --> 01:40:29,308
Oh, yeah. What time is he arriving?

1620
01:40:29,744 --> 01:40:31,769
I gotcha, Sarge. So long.

1621
01:40:32,747 --> 01:40:34,681
What'd he say?

1622
01:40:36,984 --> 01:40:39,544
Listening in on official business?

1623
01:40:40,354 --> 01:40:42,083
Not exactly, Officer.

1624
01:40:42,156 --> 01:40:46,820
It's just that as a citizen concerned
with international goodwill...

1625
01:40:46,894 --> 01:40:50,455
...I was interested in
the maharajah's visit to our fair city.

1626
01:40:50,565 --> 01:40:52,055
You were, were you?

1627
01:40:52,133 --> 01:40:56,661
After all, how often do we get
an opportunity to mingle with royalty?

1628
01:40:57,238 --> 01:41:00,537
You can bet you won't be
mingling with no royalty...

1629
01:41:00,775 --> 01:41:05,405
...because I'm going to be there to keep
all finagling freeloaders away.

1630
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:06,911
That means you.

1631
01:41:06,981 --> 01:41:08,744
And another thing, Top Cat...

1632
01:41:08,816 --> 01:41:11,512
...if I ever catch you using
that phone again...

1633
01:41:11,586 --> 01:41:14,749
...it's a free ride
in the paddy wagon for you.

1634
01:41:14,989 --> 01:41:15,978
Get me?

1635
01:41:16,724 --> 01:41:19,750
He really does that well, doesn't he?
I mean, doesn't he?

1636
01:41:19,827 --> 01:41:22,455
Dibble, the image you portray:

1637
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:24,327
Incorruptible virtue.

1638
01:41:24,432 --> 01:41:27,094
The figure of a true guardian of the people.

1639
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:29,136
If they don't give you a promotion...

1640
01:41:29,203 --> 01:41:32,366
...the least they can give you is
an Academy Award, Dibble.

1641
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,702
But they won't.

1642
01:41:33,774 --> 01:41:36,140
You know why? Because they're jealous.

1643
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:40,670
Gregory Peck should be grateful that
you chose the profession of civil servant...

1644
01:41:40,781 --> 01:41:44,512
...instead of acting.
Why, he'd be starving today. Starving!

1645
01:41:44,919 --> 01:41:47,444
All right, knock it off.

1646
01:41:47,521 --> 01:41:49,421
And remember what I told you.

1647
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:53,927
I don't want to catch you hanging around
the Sherry Plaza Hotel.

1648
01:41:54,595 --> 01:41:55,584
Got it?

1649
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:57,459
Yes, Dibble, I got it.

1650
01:41:57,598 --> 01:41:59,088
Thanks, buddy.

1651
01:42:03,304 --> 01:42:06,603
TC, Officer Dibble was awfully mad.

1652
01:42:06,674 --> 01:42:09,472
I guess we can't get to see that maharajah.

1653
01:42:10,444 --> 01:42:13,038
Nonsense, my boy.
How's he going to stop us?

1654
01:42:13,114 --> 01:42:15,344
Remember,
I've been using my brain for years.

1655
01:42:15,416 --> 01:42:17,941
Officer Dibble's is still
practically brand new.

1656
01:42:18,019 --> 01:42:20,283
Now, I want you
to round up the boys, Benny...

1657
01:42:20,354 --> 01:42:22,219
...because we're having a meeting.

1658
01:42:25,026 --> 01:42:26,653
And that's the story, fellas.

1659
01:42:26,727 --> 01:42:30,185
This maharajah is so rich,
he gives away rubies instead of money.

1660
01:42:30,264 --> 01:42:34,132
And as long as he's giving them away,
he might as well give them to us, right?

1661
01:42:34,201 --> 01:42:37,068
Remember,
this is strictly a volunteer action.

1662
01:42:37,138 --> 01:42:41,097
Anyone who doesn't wish
to become a millionaire in 24 hours...

1663
01:42:41,175 --> 01:42:42,802
...may leave right now.

1664
01:42:42,877 --> 01:42:44,003
Any questions?

1665
01:42:44,078 --> 01:42:46,342
How will I know if he gives me a ruby?

1666
01:42:46,414 --> 01:42:48,541
I never saw a ruby before.

1667
01:42:48,649 --> 01:42:52,176
That's a good question, Benny.
It shows you're thinking.

1668
01:42:52,253 --> 01:42:54,744
Just take whatever he gives you.
Don't argue.

1669
01:42:54,822 --> 01:42:57,620
If he runs out of rubies,
maybe he'll give you emeralds.

1670
01:42:57,692 --> 01:43:00,183
I think maharajahs use them
for small change.

1671
01:43:00,695 --> 01:43:02,219
Boy. Emeralds.

1672
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:05,460
People will come in from all over
to get in on this...

1673
01:43:05,533 --> 01:43:07,797
...so when we get to the hotel, spread out.

1674
01:43:07,868 --> 01:43:09,665
You see a line forming, get on it.

1675
01:43:09,737 --> 01:43:12,706
That way, we're covered.
We'll come out with something, right?

1676
01:43:12,773 --> 01:43:14,673
-Right, Top Cat.
-Right.

1677
01:43:15,242 --> 01:43:16,038
Right.

1678
01:43:19,113 --> 01:43:20,410
There it is, men.

1679
01:43:20,481 --> 01:43:22,540
Our gateway to gracious living.

1680
01:43:22,616 --> 01:43:25,050
One ruby and we can live there for a year.

1681
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:26,746
Now, we've got to move fast.

1682
01:43:26,821 --> 01:43:28,584
Me and Benny'll go in the front door.

1683
01:43:28,656 --> 01:43:30,749
Fancy and Spook, take the side entrance.

1684
01:43:30,825 --> 01:43:32,087
I gotcha, TC.

1685
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:34,184
Choo-Choo and Brain,
you take the rear door.

1686
01:43:34,261 --> 01:43:35,626
Right, rear door.

1687
01:43:35,696 --> 01:43:36,958
Any questions?

1688
01:43:37,598 --> 01:43:40,294
Where do we take the rear door to, TC?

1689
01:43:40,368 --> 01:43:43,997
Where does he take the....
You don't take it anywhere, bubblehead.

1690
01:43:44,071 --> 01:43:45,163
You just go in.

1691
01:43:45,239 --> 01:43:47,571
If you see a maharajah,
just hold out your hand.

1692
01:43:47,641 --> 01:43:48,630
Now, let's go.

1693
01:43:50,778 --> 01:43:52,939
Remember,
we don't have to be too greedy.

1694
01:43:53,014 --> 01:43:54,606
One ruby should do it.

1695
01:43:55,383 --> 01:43:56,975
Officer Dibble.

1696
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:01,848
I thought I told you I didn't want you
hanging around this hotel.

1697
01:44:02,089 --> 01:44:05,786
Benny, that's what I like about Dibble.
He remembers.

1698
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:10,328
Dibble, the maharajah should be proud
knowing he has you to protect him.

1699
01:44:10,398 --> 01:44:14,129
Anybody else would be inside
with his hand out, but not you.

1700
01:44:14,435 --> 01:44:17,131
Here you stand, staunch and vigilant.

1701
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:19,501
Too modest to speak for yourself.

1702
01:44:19,573 --> 01:44:22,235
Content in the virtue of your integrity.

1703
01:44:22,343 --> 01:44:24,140
Steely-eyed, like an eagle.

1704
01:44:24,211 --> 01:44:28,545
Not giving a thought to the legendary
generosity of this lndian prince.

1705
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:33,578
Unwilling to compromise
between avarice and pride in your work.

1706
01:44:33,988 --> 01:44:37,685
Come, Benny. We must tell the maharajah
about Officer Dibble.

1707
01:44:37,758 --> 01:44:41,091
After all, how often do we get
an opportunity to do something...

1708
01:44:41,162 --> 01:44:43,187
...for someone we really like?

1709
01:44:44,031 --> 01:44:44,963
Top Cat?

1710
01:44:45,032 --> 01:44:46,226
Yes, Dibble?

1711
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:47,289
Out.

1712
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:50,737
And stay out!

1713
01:44:51,038 --> 01:44:52,096
Oh, boy.

1714
01:44:54,975 --> 01:44:56,909
TC, what'll we do now?

1715
01:44:56,977 --> 01:44:58,740
I'm thinking.

1716
01:44:58,813 --> 01:45:01,748
I guess they only let maharajahs
in the hotel today.

1717
01:45:02,149 --> 01:45:03,275
Yes....

1718
01:45:05,753 --> 01:45:08,813
That's it, Choo-Choo.
You just gave me an idea.

1719
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:10,623
No kidding. I did?

1720
01:45:10,691 --> 01:45:12,352
Yes. Here's what you do, Benny.

1721
01:45:12,426 --> 01:45:14,792
Go to the dime store
and get me a lot of beads.

1722
01:45:14,862 --> 01:45:16,420
You know, those glass beads?

1723
01:45:16,497 --> 01:45:18,055
The rest of you, into that truck.

1724
01:45:18,132 --> 01:45:20,930
Mingle with the laundry,
chose something in your size.

1725
01:45:21,001 --> 01:45:22,525
Sheets, towels, anything.

1726
01:45:22,603 --> 01:45:24,696
We're all going to be maharajahs.

1727
01:45:28,008 --> 01:45:29,441
I'm going to like this.

1728
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:31,740
I never was a maharajah before.

1729
01:45:33,681 --> 01:45:36,343
Top Cat, I got the glass beads.

1730
01:45:36,617 --> 01:45:39,848
-What do you want them for?
-I'm a big tipper, that's why.

1731
01:45:40,454 --> 01:45:42,388
Wrap a towel around your head, Benny.

1732
01:45:42,456 --> 01:45:45,516
Is it all right to wear a Turkish towel
if I'm an lndian?

1733
01:45:45,593 --> 01:45:49,461
Sure, Dibble won't know the difference.
The closest he's ever come to royalty...

1734
01:45:49,530 --> 01:45:52,158
...was once when he had
a pair of kings playing poker.

1735
01:45:53,868 --> 01:45:55,665
All right, group, we're all set.

1736
01:45:55,736 --> 01:45:58,637
Remember to keep your mouth shut.
I'll do all the talking.

1737
01:45:58,706 --> 01:46:00,003
Follow me, men.

1738
01:46:03,377 --> 01:46:04,366
Faster.

1739
01:46:10,384 --> 01:46:12,375
It's the maharajah.

1740
01:46:16,056 --> 01:46:18,456
What a distinguished-looking guy.

1741
01:46:20,027 --> 01:46:21,892
Okay, we got past Dibble.

1742
01:46:21,962 --> 01:46:24,829
You see a line,
get on it and stick your hand out.

1743
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:26,924
Maharajah, Your Excellency.

1744
01:46:27,067 --> 01:46:28,432
A thousand pardons...

1745
01:46:28,502 --> 01:46:30,766
...but we did not expect you so soon.

1746
01:46:31,839 --> 01:46:33,272
That's funny, TC.

1747
01:46:33,407 --> 01:46:35,898
That guy thinks you're a real maharajah.

1748
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:40,447
We received your telegram,
but you did not specify the time of arrival.

1749
01:46:40,514 --> 01:46:41,776
I didn't?

1750
01:46:41,882 --> 01:46:43,747
Boy, I got to take advantage of this.

1751
01:46:43,817 --> 01:46:45,808
Did you send the wire, slave?

1752
01:46:45,886 --> 01:46:47,353
Who, me?

1753
01:46:47,688 --> 01:46:50,282
Honest, I didn't send any wire, Top--

1754
01:46:50,424 --> 01:46:52,858
Quiet, slave, I'll deal with you later.

1755
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:57,897
Five million subjects to choose from,
and I had to pick this for my secretary.

1756
01:46:57,998 --> 01:46:59,590
Now look what you've done.

1757
01:46:59,667 --> 01:47:02,158
They're not expecting us for another week.

1758
01:47:02,336 --> 01:47:03,564
How awkward.

1759
01:47:03,637 --> 01:47:06,231
Now we'll have to find another hotel.

1760
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,137
Another hotel?

1761
01:47:08,209 --> 01:47:11,372
No, you misunderstand, Your Highness.

1762
01:47:11,445 --> 01:47:13,208
Your suite is ready.

1763
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,974
Suite? Did you say our suite is ready?

1764
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,540
Certainly, Highness.

1765
01:47:18,085 --> 01:47:20,849
Front! The maharajah's bags.

1766
01:47:22,056 --> 01:47:25,082
The bags. They'll be here later.

1767
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,921
What excellent service.

1768
01:47:28,996 --> 01:47:31,226
Slave, rubies.

1769
01:47:31,565 --> 01:47:33,692
The beads, the glass beads.

1770
01:47:33,767 --> 01:47:37,828
Yes, I got them.
Here you are, Your Royal Highness.

1771
01:47:37,905 --> 01:47:39,167
Thanks, slave.

1772
01:47:39,807 --> 01:47:42,241
I hope you guys don't mind rubies?

1773
01:47:42,309 --> 01:47:45,301
I never remember to carry cash.

1774
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:47,974
Rubies!

1775
01:47:50,384 --> 01:47:51,817
-I got them!
-They're mine!

1776
01:47:51,885 --> 01:47:53,079
Stop it!

1777
01:47:53,187 --> 01:47:55,121
This is a respectable hotel.

1778
01:47:55,189 --> 01:47:56,884
Please try to remember that.

1779
01:47:56,957 --> 01:47:59,152
Yes, sir. We will, sir.

1780
01:48:00,127 --> 01:48:02,687
Will you forgive the commotion,
Your Highness?

1781
01:48:02,763 --> 01:48:04,424
Very well, if you insist.

1782
01:48:04,498 --> 01:48:05,760
Come on, gang.

1783
01:48:08,636 --> 01:48:10,001
Going up, please.

1784
01:48:10,504 --> 01:48:12,335
Oh boy, rubies. They're mine.

1785
01:48:14,308 --> 01:48:16,708
-Come on, they're mine.
-I want them.

1786
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:25,543
Boy, this is some layout, TC.

1787
01:48:25,819 --> 01:48:27,150
Yeah, like, it's cool.

1788
01:48:27,221 --> 01:48:30,281
I've never seen anything like this before.

1789
01:48:30,624 --> 01:48:32,717
You can, like, say that again, you know?

1790
01:48:32,793 --> 01:48:34,784
I said gracious living, right?

1791
01:48:35,029 --> 01:48:37,930
That's what you said.

1792
01:48:38,232 --> 01:48:40,666
Anything we want, the manager said.

1793
01:48:40,734 --> 01:48:43,965
That means unlimited credit.
We can live like kings.

1794
01:48:44,238 --> 01:48:48,231
But TC, what are we going to do
if the real maharajah comes along?

1795
01:48:48,475 --> 01:48:51,137
The real maharajah?
Bite your tongue, Benny.

1796
01:48:51,211 --> 01:48:54,647
You saw the telegram, didn't you?
He's not expected for another week.

1797
01:48:54,715 --> 01:48:56,444
So let's live, live, live.

1798
01:48:56,717 --> 01:48:59,914
But what if the hotel manager finds out?

1799
01:49:00,254 --> 01:49:02,620
Yeah, baby, like what happens then,
you know?

1800
01:49:02,690 --> 01:49:06,353
Do I hear voices of discontent
after we have it made?

1801
01:49:06,627 --> 01:49:10,461
The classiest hotel in town insists
we be their guests.

1802
01:49:10,597 --> 01:49:15,364
They fix up this $200-a-day suite for us.
They insist on feeding us.

1803
01:49:15,769 --> 01:49:16,633
Feeding us?

1804
01:49:16,704 --> 01:49:18,331
Yes, look at this menu.

1805
01:49:18,405 --> 01:49:22,705
Lobster Thermidor, Pheasant Under Glass,
Oysters Rockefeller.

1806
01:49:22,776 --> 01:49:23,743
Steak.

1807
01:49:23,844 --> 01:49:25,277
Steak. Did you say steak?

1808
01:49:25,346 --> 01:49:27,337
With mushroom sauce, yet.

1809
01:49:27,748 --> 01:49:29,909
Mushroom sauce yet. Where?

1810
01:49:31,285 --> 01:49:33,480
Any of you guys ever had Baked Alaska?

1811
01:49:33,554 --> 01:49:35,419
I never even had it raw.

1812
01:49:35,823 --> 01:49:38,519
Does it really say "wild strawberries"?

1813
01:49:38,659 --> 01:49:40,650
Like, six-inch-thick steaks?

1814
01:49:40,728 --> 01:49:44,630
Hello, Room Service?
This is the Maharajah of Pookajee.

1815
01:49:46,934 --> 01:49:48,993
-Room Service.
-What took you so long?

1816
01:49:49,069 --> 01:49:49,831
Never mind.

1817
01:49:49,903 --> 01:49:52,838
Send up everything on the menu.
Charge it to the manager...

1818
01:49:52,906 --> 01:49:54,134
...with my compliments.

1819
01:49:54,208 --> 01:49:56,369
Here's a little something for your trouble.

1820
01:49:56,443 --> 01:49:57,808
Keep the change.

1821
01:49:59,947 --> 01:50:01,744
Look at the size of that ruby.

1822
01:50:01,815 --> 01:50:03,783
-It's mine.
-He gave it to me.

1823
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:05,375
He gave it to me.

1824
01:50:06,353 --> 01:50:07,980
It's every man for himself.

1825
01:50:15,095 --> 01:50:16,585
Front?

1826
01:50:18,966 --> 01:50:21,230
Back, Front! Back!

1827
01:50:22,636 --> 01:50:25,002
-I got it!
-No, you don't!

1828
01:50:25,072 --> 01:50:27,768
-Order!
-Give me my ruby!

1829
01:50:27,841 --> 01:50:30,002
-It's mine!
-Help!

1830
01:50:37,951 --> 01:50:40,647
Now remember, that maharajah's loaded.

1831
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:43,713
We go in, heist the jewels, and scram.
Got it?

1832
01:50:43,857 --> 01:50:47,554
Yes, boss. But what do we do first?
Scram or heist the jewels?

1833
01:50:48,929 --> 01:50:51,955
Never mind. Just do what I tell you.

1834
01:50:52,633 --> 01:50:56,091
Boy. Wild strawberries
with whipped cream.

1835
01:50:56,203 --> 01:50:57,795
This is really living.

1836
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:01,804
TC, somebody's at the door.

1837
01:51:01,909 --> 01:51:04,309
Well, open it.
That's probably Room Service.

1838
01:51:04,378 --> 01:51:07,404
That's how they work
in a classy joint. Fast.

1839
01:51:07,481 --> 01:51:09,745
Hi, fellas. Did you bring the food?

1840
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:13,445
Food? No, we brought something else.

1841
01:51:14,388 --> 01:51:15,252
What?

1842
01:51:15,589 --> 01:51:17,056
-This.
-Yikes!

1843
01:51:17,658 --> 01:51:19,683
Tell him to put it on the table, Benny.

1844
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:22,354
Don't wait for us, you must be starved.

1845
01:51:23,464 --> 01:51:25,329
-Not anymore.
-Why not?

1846
01:51:25,732 --> 01:51:27,700
I just lost my appetite.

1847
01:51:27,768 --> 01:51:30,601
Now, don't tell me
they got the order wrong.

1848
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,632
You the maharajah?

1849
01:51:34,708 --> 01:51:36,972
I'm sorry,
but we're awfully busy right now.

1850
01:51:37,044 --> 01:51:38,341
No time for autographs.

1851
01:51:38,412 --> 01:51:40,141
This is a stickup.

1852
01:51:40,314 --> 01:51:43,806
Yeah, a heist.
We want all the rubies you got, pal.

1853
01:51:44,084 --> 01:51:45,517
You want the rubies?

1854
01:51:45,686 --> 01:51:48,211
Say, this is like the Peter Pistol Program.

1855
01:51:48,288 --> 01:51:50,381
You're not Peter Pistol, are you?

1856
01:51:51,058 --> 01:51:52,150
Who, me?

1857
01:51:52,226 --> 01:51:53,853
Of course you are.

1858
01:51:53,927 --> 01:51:55,952
That steely glint in your eyes....

1859
01:51:56,029 --> 01:51:58,691
That strong jaw.... You are Peter Pistol.

1860
01:51:58,765 --> 01:52:00,790
No, I'm not. My name is Spike.

1861
01:52:00,868 --> 01:52:04,235
You're joking.
I know you must be Peter Pistol.

1862
01:52:04,338 --> 01:52:06,602
I leave it to my servant here. Slave?

1863
01:52:06,773 --> 01:52:09,571
Look at this handsome man.
What do you see?

1864
01:52:09,643 --> 01:52:10,905
Peter Pistol, right?

1865
01:52:10,978 --> 01:52:14,675
I don't see Peter Pistol,
but I see a pistol all right.

1866
01:52:15,015 --> 01:52:17,006
See, what did I tell you?

1867
01:52:18,385 --> 01:52:21,445
And you.... Don't tell me.

1868
01:52:21,555 --> 01:52:26,117
You must be the star of the TV program,
Have Gun, Will Shoot.

1869
01:52:26,193 --> 01:52:30,630
Wrong, this program ain't on TV.
It's coming in live.

1870
01:52:30,797 --> 01:52:33,994
We ain't got all day,
so make with the rubies.

1871
01:52:34,268 --> 01:52:36,736
Yes, the rubies. Well, I don't know.

1872
01:52:36,803 --> 01:52:40,330
As a rule, I only give away rubbies,
I mean rubies...

1873
01:52:40,407 --> 01:52:42,466
...to those who do me a favor.

1874
01:52:42,543 --> 01:52:46,946
Then that's me, pal,
on account of I'm doing you a big favor...

1875
01:52:47,114 --> 01:52:49,139
...by not blowing your head off.

1876
01:52:49,516 --> 01:52:51,882
Now quit stalling, and hand over the loot.

1877
01:52:51,952 --> 01:52:57,049
What a pity. It hardly seems worth
the trouble you gentlemen have gone to.

1878
01:52:57,925 --> 01:53:00,393
Hardly even a $100,000 worth.

1879
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:03,657
You must order some more tomorrow.

1880
01:53:04,131 --> 01:53:05,155
Yes, sir.

1881
01:53:05,566 --> 01:53:07,329
How would it look in the papers?

1882
01:53:07,401 --> 01:53:10,700
Here I am, one of the wealthiest
maharajahs in the world....

1883
01:53:10,771 --> 01:53:14,104
To be robbed of such a paltry sum
is disgraceful.

1884
01:53:14,508 --> 01:53:17,841
Promise me you won't tell.
I'll be sure to have some more tomorrow.

1885
01:53:17,911 --> 01:53:20,709
Do you gentlemen think
you can come back tomorrow?

1886
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:23,841
I don't know, Your Majesty.
It's up to the boss here.

1887
01:53:23,917 --> 01:53:25,851
He's the brains of this operation.

1888
01:53:25,919 --> 01:53:28,387
Well, if you don't mind this little bit....

1889
01:53:28,622 --> 01:53:30,556
Oh, no, that's okay.

1890
01:53:30,724 --> 01:53:32,521
And thanks, Your Majesty.

1891
01:53:32,693 --> 01:53:35,924
Say, are you sure you're not Peter Pistol?

1892
01:53:35,996 --> 01:53:38,055
Honest, I ain't. He's a little taller.

1893
01:53:38,131 --> 01:53:40,258
Knock it off, and let's get going.

1894
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:46,130
They got away with all our rubies.

1895
01:53:46,206 --> 01:53:48,299
They were only glass beads, Benny.

1896
01:53:48,375 --> 01:53:50,707
Okay, you guys, you can come out now.

1897
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:53,810
Nice going, TC.

1898
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,745
All in a day's work, boys.

1899
01:53:55,816 --> 01:53:58,512
Benny, run to the dime store
and get some more beads.

1900
01:53:58,585 --> 01:54:00,416
We'll need them
when our dinners get here.

1901
01:54:00,487 --> 01:54:01,545
Okay, TC.

1902
01:54:07,761 --> 01:54:09,729
How are you? I beg your pardon.

1903
01:54:09,796 --> 01:54:12,321
I'm from Finchley,
Finchley & Finchley Jewelers.

1904
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:15,163
The Maharajah of Pookajee
has requested us...

1905
01:54:15,235 --> 01:54:18,033
...to bring our most precious gems
for his collection.

1906
01:54:18,105 --> 01:54:19,834
Is the maharajah in?

1907
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,902
Yes, but he's having lunch now.

1908
01:54:22,976 --> 01:54:24,671
I wouldn't want to disturb him.

1909
01:54:24,745 --> 01:54:26,872
But there's one of his servants.

1910
01:54:26,947 --> 01:54:29,040
Perhaps you can give the jewels to him.

1911
01:54:29,116 --> 01:54:30,048
Hey, you.

1912
01:54:30,117 --> 01:54:30,947
Who, me?

1913
01:54:31,018 --> 01:54:34,010
Yes, this gentleman wants to see you.

1914
01:54:34,121 --> 01:54:35,213
Okay.

1915
01:54:35,522 --> 01:54:37,786
Take these jewels to your master.

1916
01:54:37,858 --> 01:54:39,348
He's expecting them.

1917
01:54:40,661 --> 01:54:45,098
TC was right.
You sure do get good service in this hotel.

1918
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:49,860
TC, I got the beads.

1919
01:54:49,936 --> 01:54:51,130
Good boy.

1920
01:54:51,204 --> 01:54:53,502
I got some real nice ones this time.

1921
01:54:53,573 --> 01:54:56,337
Maybe I should give one to Dibble,
just for laughs.

1922
01:54:56,410 --> 01:54:58,241
He'd think he got a fortune.

1923
01:55:00,614 --> 01:55:03,310
Take a look out the window, Benny.
See what's going on.

1924
01:55:03,383 --> 01:55:06,750
All I see is a limousine
and a bunch of motorcycle cops.

1925
01:55:08,755 --> 01:55:10,916
They're stopping here at the hotel.

1926
01:55:11,191 --> 01:55:13,716
Probably our Rockefeller Oysters arriving.

1927
01:55:13,794 --> 01:55:16,991
Go downstairs
and see that they get here right away.

1928
01:55:17,064 --> 01:55:19,362
I'm starved. Go like the wind, boy.

1929
01:55:19,433 --> 01:55:22,129
Go, fly!

1930
01:55:22,369 --> 01:55:25,668
Your slightest wish is my command,
My Highness.

1931
01:55:28,608 --> 01:55:33,568
Make ready. The Maharajah of Pookajee
arrives this very moment.

1932
01:55:34,114 --> 01:55:37,174
Why, the maharajah is already here.

1933
01:55:37,417 --> 01:55:39,510
He arrived not an hour ago.

1934
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:42,347
Hey, Sam. You, at the desk.

1935
01:55:42,823 --> 01:55:46,281
Where are those oysters?
The maharajah's getting very impatient.

1936
01:55:46,493 --> 01:55:48,427
That is one of his servants.

1937
01:55:48,495 --> 01:55:50,793
Imposter. He is a fake.

1938
01:55:50,864 --> 01:55:53,128
The real maharajah is waiting outside.

1939
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:56,528
Holy mackerel. Wait until TC hears this.

1940
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:03,699
TC, that's the worst.
That's the maharajah down there.

1941
01:56:03,844 --> 01:56:05,072
The real one.

1942
01:56:05,145 --> 01:56:07,909
The real one?
I knew this was too good to last.

1943
01:56:07,981 --> 01:56:10,176
All right, everybody, scramble.

1944
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:11,512
Everybody out.

1945
01:56:11,985 --> 01:56:14,146
How do we get out? Like, what do we do?

1946
01:56:14,221 --> 01:56:16,951
Do? Do what I do: use the emergency exit.

1947
01:56:17,023 --> 01:56:21,483
Everybody down the laundry chute.
We'll scatter and meet down by the docks.

1948
01:56:27,701 --> 01:56:29,362
It's the maharajah.

1949
01:56:30,103 --> 01:56:32,663
Excuse me, sir. I didn't see you coming.

1950
01:56:32,739 --> 01:56:35,833
Quite all right, Officer.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1951
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:38,271
Just a minute, Your Majesty.

1952
01:56:38,345 --> 01:56:40,040
You dropped your jewels.

1953
01:56:40,113 --> 01:56:42,240
Jewels? Yes, jewels.

1954
01:56:42,315 --> 01:56:45,648
Well, you keep them, Officer.
You've done such a splendid job.

1955
01:56:45,819 --> 01:56:48,117
Splendid, splendid boy.

1956
01:56:48,722 --> 01:56:50,553
Gosh, thanks.

1957
01:56:52,225 --> 01:56:54,250
Wait until I tell the wife about this.

1958
01:56:56,763 --> 01:56:58,390
Everything is ready, sir.

1959
01:56:58,465 --> 01:57:00,160
They're expecting you inside.

1960
01:57:00,233 --> 01:57:02,394
They are, are they?

1961
01:57:03,436 --> 01:57:06,405
Those autograph hounds
aren't going to catch me.

1962
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:09,138
I'm going in the side entrance.

1963
01:57:14,781 --> 01:57:16,681
Oh, no. Not another one.

1964
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:19,817
The joint's jumping with maharajahs
all of a sudden.

1965
01:57:20,053 --> 01:57:24,046
At least get your hat on straight.
You got a better chance of looking like one.

1966
01:57:24,124 --> 01:57:25,614
Thank you kindly, sir.

1967
01:57:25,692 --> 01:57:26,488
Forget it.

1968
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,188
I can tell you one thing,
you're wasting your time.

1969
01:57:29,262 --> 01:57:31,389
The real maharajah just showed up.

1970
01:57:31,631 --> 01:57:33,098
Here, my good man.

1971
01:57:33,166 --> 01:57:34,133
What's this?

1972
01:57:34,201 --> 01:57:35,668
Some rubies for you.

1973
01:57:35,735 --> 01:57:38,329
I always reward kindness with rubies.

1974
01:57:38,438 --> 01:57:40,770
Oh, brother. He's got that line down pat.

1975
01:57:40,841 --> 01:57:44,504
Well, so long,
and arrivadurchi-urchi to you, kiddo.

1976
01:57:45,745 --> 01:57:48,509
Here he comes now. Hi, Top Cat.

1977
01:57:50,450 --> 01:57:53,783
How do you like that? Rubies.
That guy's using my racket.

1978
01:57:54,487 --> 01:57:56,478
Everybody's getting into the act.

1979
01:57:56,556 --> 01:57:58,046
Who needs this junk?

1980
01:58:03,296 --> 01:58:07,289
Let's see, maybe I can still work
this combination and make $50.

1981
01:58:09,202 --> 01:58:10,794
Hi, Top Cat.

1982
01:58:11,004 --> 01:58:12,767
Well, it's Officer Dibble.

1983
01:58:12,839 --> 01:58:15,740
I just dropped by
to say good-bye to you guys.

1984
01:58:15,809 --> 01:58:17,834
Good-bye? Where you going?

1985
01:58:18,245 --> 01:58:20,839
Why aren't you in uniform?
What happened?

1986
01:58:20,914 --> 01:58:24,145
Me and the wife are
taking a trip for a couple of weeks.

1987
01:58:24,517 --> 01:58:25,711
A trip?

1988
01:58:25,785 --> 01:58:31,655
Officer Dibble, sir, don't tell me
you got a horse running and never told me.

1989
01:58:31,758 --> 01:58:33,350
A horse? No.

1990
01:58:33,526 --> 01:58:38,156
I bumped into that maharajah and I guess
he appreciated the police protection...

1991
01:58:38,231 --> 01:58:41,689
...I gave him,
because he gave me a bag full of rubies.

1992
01:58:42,235 --> 01:58:44,533
Rubies. They were glass beads.

1993
01:58:44,871 --> 01:58:46,270
Glass beads.

1994
01:58:47,641 --> 01:58:49,905
Okay, have it your way.

1995
01:58:50,277 --> 01:58:53,542
You say glass beads, I say rubies.

1996
01:58:54,214 --> 01:58:56,273
So long, Top Cat.

1997
01:58:58,318 --> 01:59:00,081
Now, how did that happen?

1998
01:59:00,153 --> 01:59:01,882
I must have goofed someplace.

1999
01:59:01,955 --> 01:59:03,013
TC?

2000
01:59:03,123 --> 01:59:04,954
You want to hear something funny?

2001
01:59:05,025 --> 01:59:08,290
Remember that little guy
you bumped into at the hotel?

2002
01:59:08,361 --> 01:59:11,853
Here's his picture in the paper.
He's the real maharajah.

2003
01:59:12,198 --> 01:59:13,358
The real maharajah?

2004
01:59:13,433 --> 01:59:14,764
Yes, look.

2005
01:59:16,336 --> 01:59:20,170
"The Maharajah of Pookajee
arrives at hotel today.

2006
01:59:20,707 --> 01:59:24,370
"Eccentric millionaire reported
giving away fortune in rubies."

2007
01:59:24,811 --> 01:59:26,108
How do you like that?

2008
01:59:26,179 --> 01:59:29,876
I thought he was a phony operator,
and it turns out he's the real thing.

2009
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:32,748
He even gives me a whole bag of rubies,
and what do I do?

2010
01:59:32,819 --> 01:59:34,548
I chuck them in the ocean.

2011
01:59:34,821 --> 01:59:36,846
In the ocean? Wait, what am I saying?

2012
01:59:36,923 --> 01:59:39,949
Here we are talking
while some poor fish is getting rich.

2013
01:59:40,026 --> 01:59:41,653
Quick, Benny, get the gang.

2014
01:59:41,728 --> 01:59:44,390
Bring Aqua-Lungs, flippers,
snorkels, get a boat.

2015
01:59:44,464 --> 01:59:46,523
Get going. Move it, boy.

2016
01:59:49,903 --> 01:59:52,064
A little more to the left, Choo-Choo.

2017
01:59:52,138 --> 01:59:54,265
Choo-Choo, you see anything?

2018
01:59:54,708 --> 01:59:57,268
Spook, you look under those rocks.

2019
01:59:57,477 --> 02:00:00,844
Brain, go deeper. No, to your left.

2020
02:00:01,081 --> 02:00:02,480
No, to your right.

2021
02:00:02,849 --> 02:00:05,113
Back this way. Oh, this is ridiculous.

2022
02:00:05,185 --> 02:00:08,450
What am I doing,
sending children out to do a man's job?

2023
02:00:08,521 --> 02:00:10,284
Here, Benny, hold my hat.

2024
02:00:10,357 --> 02:00:11,619
Geronimo!

2025
02:00:14,294 --> 02:00:15,989
Now, why did he do that?

2026
02:00:16,162 --> 02:00:18,062
He knows he can't swim.
