1
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,333
It's time.

2
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,133
Pillow fight!

3
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:51,968
Go to bed.

4
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:53,893
Turn the lights off. 

5
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:05,727
Come on, hurry!

6
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,388
- Hey, give me the pillow!
 - But what do you want...

7
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:39,852
It's dark, but I'm not afraid.

8
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,451
What's this noise ...

9
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:46,452
It's the coward ...

10
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,289
There's nothing to fear. I'm almost there.

11
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:28,324
Here we go again.

12
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:31,008
You'll end up being caught, Tim!
 
13
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:34,252
Hello, Adhara.

14
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:15,406
Listen all. Bobby peed in bed.

15
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:16,723
Shut up!

16
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:19,403
I'm missing a sock! Who's got it?

17
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:20,768
Who would want your old smellu sock,

18
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,845
 - Yesterday it was here.

19
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:58,931
Hey, that's mine!

20
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:02,013
It's taken.

21
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,659
Let's go...The TV!

22
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:38,572
Ten points!

23
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:40,492
I found you!

24
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,796
It's mine. Give it to me!

25
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,477
One, two, three.

26
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,525
Hey, pass it - Here!

27
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,443
That's Tim, don't count on him.

28
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:38,965
Oh, no! Look what he did, idiot!

29
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,242
Sorry!

30
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:46,811
Now you've blown it....

31
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:50,131
- Go get the ball, quickly!
 - That's what I'm trying to...

32
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:03,009
-It's in the basement.
 -I'm not going there.

33
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,051
The ball is in the basement? Now what do we do?

34
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:09,728
-Who's gonna go get it now?
 -The one who threw it there should go bring it back.

35
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,372
Go, coward!

36
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:14,642
I can't, it's very dark!

37
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:17,122
Go, I can see it from here!

38
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:27,048
You'd better come back with the ball 
 or you'll get into trouble.

39
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,688
Don't dare coming back without it!

40
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,443
Let's see how he gets it...

41
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,202
Where is it?

42
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,407
Who took it?

43
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:18,366
Give me back the window knob!

44
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,167
It's not funny.

45
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,808
What is it? You scared of the dark?

46
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:04,612
Finally.

47
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:18,441
Where are you, Adhara? From here...

48
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:20,092
I don't see you.

49
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:23,847
Let's see...

50
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,568
Here is the North Star.

51
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:31,129
A bit lower, the Ursa Minor.

52
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:34,724
Pegasus gallops next to the Unicorn..

53
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:37,851
The Dragon runs from Perseus...

54
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:42,242
and between Orion and the Two Dogs ...

55
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:44,445
the Wolf...

56
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:47,606
It should be right...here!

57
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,406
Hello, Adhara!

58
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:55,362
What is it?

59
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:01,728
It's impossible!

60
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,401
You see? It's not a yellow bat.

61
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:38,889
- It's a child.
- Are you for real?

62
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:46,002
A very rude child.

63
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,209
I'm sorry. Thank...

64
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,284
Thank you very much for saving me!

65
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:57,210
Calm down! Listen, the stars...

66
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:03,281
Let's see...Which one of you is responsible
 for this child?

67
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:20,286
Ah... Tobermory.
 I should have guessed.

68
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:24,692
Why is this child still awake?
 You were taking another nap!

69
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:27,845
Can't you do your job well at least once? 
 - Why are you talking to the cats?

70
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,403
- Why don't you ask me?
 - And who are you?

71
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:33,529
I am ... I'm Tim.

72
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:36,327
And you...? Who are you?

73
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,489
Are all these your cats?

74
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:40,689
Why would you think they call me
 the Cat herder?

75
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:44,812
Tobermory, make him sleep. 
 And you, be a good boy and go to bed.

76
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:47,084
That's what I was trying to explain to you!

77
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:49,608
I can't go to bed because
  the window does not open

78
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:52,492
that's why I climbet up here and discovered a star was missing.

79
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:54,484
And now I can't go to sleep!

80
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:55,802
What did you say, what is missing?

81
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:57,523
My star!

82
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:01,004
Look, look here.

83
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:03,849
This is my star, Adhara.

84
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,527
Now look at it. 

85
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,127
You see? It's not there.

86
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,010
- I can solve the problem.
 - Really?

87
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:19,125
That's it. And now go to bed!

88
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:22,171
I can't go to bed until my star returns.

89
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:26,849
Another one just disappeared!
 Aren't we going to do anything?

90
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,971
We? I'm sorry. This is the responsibility of Mr. Moka.

91
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,851
Moka? Who is Moka?

92
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:35,483
- He knows the stars? 
 - You little stubborn and annoying one...

93
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:39,202
It's the boss, the boss, the big fish
that directs Nocturna.

94
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:42,012
Nocturna? What is Nocturna?

95
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:46,445
Don't you realize that I am a very busy person?

96
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:50,128
It's not easy to be the Cat herder.
 I have many responsibilities.

97
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:53,012
I have to tell this to Moka, about the stars gone missing.

98
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:56,085
- Impossible, Moka never receives visitors. 
 - Me yes, he will receive me!

99
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,369
He's too important!

100
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,085
This cat ...

101
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,246
I'll give you a last chance, Tobermory.

102
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,485
If you can't do your job, you'll leave the herd.

103
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:12,211
Make him fall asleep!

104
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:17,332
You starting to feel sleepy?

105
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:19,609
What an annoying and loud cat...

106
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:20,603
Not even a little?

107
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:25,652
- It's another star gone!
 - Come on, concentrate on his meowing.

108
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:26,962
You need to be closer.

109
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:31,366
- Why do you want me to go to sleep?
 - Because when the children are awake,

110
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,763
they are noisy, mischievous, annoying, 

111
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:36,845
unpredictable, quarrelsome,
 restless and naughty.

112
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:39,811
Whilst when the children are asleep...

113
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,090
they are perfect. 
- That's what you think. But I have to see Moka.

114
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:48,007
There are several ways to make
 a child go to bed ....

115
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:49,447
I'm sorry.

116
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,212
This kid is driving me crazy.

117
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:02,365
What do you say if I take you in the office of
 Mr. Moka and then go to sleep?

118
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:04,687
Agreed.

119
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:08,052
Well, then mount up and hold on tight.

120
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,608
You wanna wake up the whole city?!
 Stop shouting!

121
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,889
And don't scratch my back!

122
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:38,012
Ah, children...

123
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:39,004
Here we are, the headquarters of Nocturna.

124
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,324
You can't wait a moment?

125
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:48,053
We must hurry, I must warn Moka!

126
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:49,532
Calm down, kid.

127
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,843
You all wait out here.
 You too, Tobermory.

128
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:55,085
It's about time you learned to behave.

129
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:58,329
- Stay behind me.
 - An hour!

130
00:16:58,493 --> 00:16:59,562
an hour late!

131
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:05,566
- Relax, grandpa, don't worry, it's just coffee.
 - 'Mr.' Grandpa for you, young man.

132
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,088
Moka is waiting and is losing his patience.

133
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:10,084
Take it to his office, now!

134
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:12,612
We must deliver it to Moka? 
 The last time we did it...

135
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:16,131
we almost lost our heads.
- Well, try to learn to be on time

136
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:17,692
and nothing bad will happen to you!

137
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:20,651
All right, Grandpa.
 Don't panic like this.

138
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:24,044
The delivery note? 
 You must sign the delivery note!

139
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:27,124
Little delinquents. 

140
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:32,170
What brings you here all of a sudden?

141
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,451
The child wants to see Moka and I couldn't
 convince his tough pumpkin

142
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,252
that Moka doesn't receive anyone.
 I should have sent him to sleep, but ...

143
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,369
Who are you talking about?

144
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:42,807
I'm talking about him.

145
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:48,049
But where...?

146
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:53,250
You know what? Maybe I should take it easy.

147
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,563
Working too much, Grandpa.

148
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:59,204
I'll ask for a holiday.
 This is what I'll do.

149
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,647
Wait! I need to find Moka!

150
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,883
Where is the brat now?

151
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:38,162
- Pay attention.
 - Excuse me.

152
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,609
It's my first important job, 
 I can't be late.

153
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:45,044
What can I say, I think beginners are really cute.

154
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:47,249
Look, here's one.

155
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:52,085
Tell me if he doesn't look adorable.

156
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:55,051
Beware, they serve more crickets in section three.

157
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:57,647
Come on, guys! Let's give a little rhythm to the night!

158
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:03,048
I don't know what's happening, but this
 sounds nothing like a grasshopper.

159
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:06,249
We have a lot of dry grass out there.

160
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,369
You'd have to climb at twenty-one.

161
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,012
Give me another. 
 - Enough!

162
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:11,401
Get some for the gardens!

163
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:14,610
- One more in the street.
 - Are you sure? It's the second round.

164
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:18,732
I said fill it!
 I know my limits.

165
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:20,842
Look where you're going. Watch out!

166
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:24,449
Last call for sharing dreams.

167
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:26,729
"...and then, without knowing how,

168
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:30,727
you find yourself in the middle of
the classroom ... in your underwear."

169
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,531
What kind of dream is this?

170
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:36,606
It has no style! The prose is vulgar and superficial!

171
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:39,970
Okay. I accept it just because we need to print

172
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,522
and we need  the material. Otherwise...

173
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:44,885
I thought it was interesting.

174
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,569
You have to push, not throw.

175
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,486
You just have to push it to the edge.

176
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:54,565
Until there's only one leg or arm hanging ... 
 Try it again.

177
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:03,409
- Wait I'm coming with you!
 - It's full.

178
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,372
Closed.

179
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,569
You can't enter here without permission. 
 It's not right.

180
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:15,646
And the doorman told me that Moka 
 didn't receive anyone today. He's very busy.

181
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:19,089
He will receive me. My problems are very important.

182
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:22,643
Excuse me, could you tell me where I can find Moka?

183
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:25,281
Who allowed you in?
 Unauthorized people.

184
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:28,013
Relax. He's not dangerous. 
 He found...

185
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:30,733
Security. There's an intruder in the building.

186
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,929
Security? Security!

187
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:36,047
He said that if it was not for me ...

188
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:39,046
Security alert! Unauthorized people in the building

189
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:40,282
Don't move.

190
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:43,445
Why did you call the security? Was it necessary?

191
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:46,491
I was going to take him away immediately, and only ...

192
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:48,769
- That's why I don't like this place. 
 - Follow us, sir.

193
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:49,524
But...

194
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:52,969
I'm not the intruder! It's this stubborn child.

195
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:55,087
No, not again!

196
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:59,246
We'll keep an eye on the fat.
 He could do something.

197
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,087
I don't want to go in there.

198
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:22,528
Moka will have a heart attack.
 Remember last time?

199
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:25,571
The more time you stay in, the worse it gets.

200
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:28,486
What do you mean by "the more in"...?
 You come with me.

201
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:29,483
Me?

202
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,803
Why sacrifice both?
 You go alone.

203
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:35,124
Excuse me, can you tell me
 where can I find Moka?

204
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:42,411
Good luck, kid.

205
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:45,766
- It's time. The coffee pot is empty.
 - What?

206
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:48,288
Put the coffee beans inside.

207
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:52,284
But I ... 
 - Move! It's more than an hour that I didn't drink.

208
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:13,125
Are you Moka, the boss who rules over Nocturna?

209
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:16,763
Well, well. Look what we have here? A child.

210
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:19,208
- Tell me, why are you here?
 - I have to talk to you.

211
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,762
Talk? No, no, no.
 I'm too busy.

212
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:23,412
Too busy.

213
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:27,367
But it's very important!

214
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,124
Let's see...

215
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:35,921
Meeting with the bats union, meeting of contents...

216
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,130
You're lucky, I have a gap.
 Two minutes!

217
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:43,250
So...want to talk or
 you prefer to lose two minutes?

218
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:45,051
The night ends at six o'clock on the dot, kid.

219
00:22:45,493 --> 00:22:49,042
Well, you see, Mr. Moka.
 It's about the stars.

220
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:49,804
Stars?

221
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:53,602
Didn't you lose a sock or mess up the sheets?

222
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:56,492
It's my star, but not only mine, because...

223
00:22:56,653 --> 00:22:58,848
You're just a child. What do you have to do with stars?

224
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:00,082
Shouldn't you be in bed?

225
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,083
That's the whole problem!

226
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:04,131
I can't go to sleep because my star disappeared..

227
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:08,923
- And I heard that you are in charge here.
 - Exactly. A very important work.

228
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:12,286
You have no idea: roll the sheets,

229
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:15,331
spread the feathers... make the eyes bleary, for example.

230
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:16,529
Listen.

231
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:20,612
Do you remember ever waking up without your hair in a mess?

232
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:23,082
Or not hearing the wood floor creaking at night?

233
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:25,005
You should give thanks to them:

234
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:27,084
the faithful and devoted 
 workers of the night.

235
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:30,245
All must work in harmony,
 otherwise it would all be ruined.

236
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:32,847
- And what would happen then?
 - I don't know.

237
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:36,164
And you don't want to know.
 It would give you goose bumps.

238
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,052
But it is very important that the stars don't disappear.

239
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:40,248
You must do something!

240
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:42,446
'I' must?

241
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:45,207
You're telling me what to do?

242
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:51,522
I am the great master supervisor
 and a child comes and tells me what to do.

243
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:53,843
I don't understand. I have employees

244
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:57,562
who take care of small things. 
 - Small things?

245
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:00,725
You mean there are others dealing with the stars?

246
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:04,249
Of course, genius.
 The Star Keeper.

247
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,449
He's not doing a good job.

248
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,332
He already lost three stars, probably more.

249
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:14,408
- And I'm the only one to sound the alarm.
 - I gave you my precious time

250
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:20,011
and you're telling me I'm not doing a good job.

251
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,567
Did you see a child over here?

252
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:25,852
No. Because children don't solve problems.

253
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:29,649
The children only eat chocolate, break things and cry or whine.

254
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:33,283
I'm sorry. I don't ...
 It's not what I meant, but ...

255
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:36,172
Just look at the sky and you see it!

256
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,244
We must warn the Star Keeper!

257
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:42,804
No one will be warned and you know why?

258
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:46,649
Because during my night no error occurs.

259
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:47,848
But I...

260
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,646
You already made me lose too much time.

261
00:24:57,713 --> 00:24:59,763
Make sure you sign out.

262
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:07,927
So much coffee can't be good.

263
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:09,446
And now, what?

264
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:37,966
- They swallowed the bait, boss.
 - Excellent job, Mr. Pei.

265
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:39,964
Now we just have to wait.

266
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:44,411
How could they do this to me?!
 Throw me in the tower...

267
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:45,801
What a humiliation!

268
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:49,886
And all thanks to you, Tobermory.
 What's wrong with you?

269
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:52,692
Instead of making him sleep, you sleep!

270
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:56,846
And now your child has disappeared in the Tower of Moka.

271
00:25:57,493 --> 00:25:59,484
Why can't you be like the other cats?

272
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:06,125
Hello, Cat herder!

273
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:12,686
There you are!

274
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:16,050
- So, I guess they threw you out before you got to see Moka?
 - No.

275
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:17,805
I saw him.

276
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:20,043
Ah...well...Remember our agreement?

277
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:22,807
If I were to bring you to Moka, you'd go to bed.

278
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:24,645 
But I can't!

279
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:27,532
I must do what Moka said.

280
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:29,445
And what did he say?

281
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:31,729
To find the Star Keeper

282
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:33,884
and tell him about the missing stars.

283
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:36,883
Moka told you this?

284
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:38,682
Yes.

285
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:42,971
I think I'll go and ask Moka about what you said.

286
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,452
It's not a good idea!

287
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,212
Why?

288
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:49,723
He has a lot to do now.

289
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:52,646
And he told me that he didn't want to be disturbed.

290
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:55,966
No worries, I'm sure he'll receive me.

291
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:59,728
Look what he gave me.
 The address of the Star Keeper.

292
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,168
What is this?

293
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:06,648
Gee?! An official document...
 It seems to be real.

294
00:27:06,813 --> 00:27:08,644
It's in the lighthouse.

295
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:10,007
Wait wait wait a second!

296
00:27:10,173 --> 00:27:12,129
Do you know how far it is?

297
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:15,251
It will take all night to get there
 and that means ...

298
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:17,927
I can't afford such a thing on my record.

299
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:20,607
OK. I'll take you to the Star Keeper.

300
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,571
But then you go straight to bed.

301
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:25,883
After all, there is only one thing left to do tonight.

302
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:28,692
- Which thing? 
 - Make sure you sleep!

303
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:34,001
Quick. The night ends at six.
 There's no time to lose.

304
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:03,723
"you try to cover it
  the best way you can

305
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:08,171
but the other children are laughing at you 
 whilst the teacher ...."

306
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,642
They write such short dreams today.

307
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:23,408
Absolutely perfect.

308
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:38,487
So many cats! Will they follow us all the way?

309
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:40,803
This proves how little you know...

310
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:45,445
Each child has a cat assigned that will guard him or her 
 through the night from outside,

311
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:48,173
keeping them asleep with their meows.

312
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:51,162
It's a big responsibility.

313
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:54,248
So...Mine is Tobermory?

314
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:57,803
Yes, a comatose cat and an insomniac child. Perfect match. 

315
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:08,411
Watch this. Isn't it beautiful?

316
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:12,845
- I don't like the night too much.
 - What? You can't mean it.

317
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:17,211
It's dark, sad and scary.
 I don't like it at all!

318
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:19,011
But it's full of wonderful things!

319
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:23,246
The only good thing about the night are
 the stars. And now they're disappearing.

320
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:27,292
Ah, this is the weirdest, most annoying kid... 
 - Silence!

321
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,921
We are trying to play music here!
 What a lack of respect!

322
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:31,762
What is it?

323
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:33,567
It's a whisperer.

324
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:36,645
Do you think that things just happen
 by accident at night?

325
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:38,726
Pay attention.

326
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:53,490
Look at that one ... How unprofessional.

327
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:18,453
But what ...? I can't believe it!

328
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:19,728
What's going on?

329
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:23,522
The Cat herder is with Tim.
 What could they possibly be doing together?

330
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:27,003
This was not in the plan.
 It could ruin everything.

331
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:29,892
Separate him from the Cat herder immediately!

332
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:33,206
What? You wanna do "that"?

333
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:39,888
-Do "that"? Don't even think about it! We don't need 
 anything so extreme for the moment.


334
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:45,525
Ok... I'll be there before you can say psss...

335
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,964
-It wasn't bad.
- What a night! I'm exhausted.

336
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:55,047
See you, Jimmy. You've been great tonight. Well done!

337
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:57,853
Well done ... for a beginner.

338
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:05,891
How insensitive! Sleeping during one of
 my best concerts!

339
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:08,009
Wake up, you filthy beast!

340
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:18,044
So what do you say now about the night?
 Do you still think it's sad?

341
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:22,001
To be honest, I'd say it's getting even darker.

342
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:26,166
- We must hurry.
 - Sure, sure. Come on, guys, let's go.

343
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:32,122
What's going on?

344
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:35,203
Why are they abandoning the herd?

345
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:38,242
What's happening to you?

346
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,885
What are they looking at?

347
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:56,523
What is ... that?

348
00:32:58,373 --> 00:32:59,408
I don't know.

349
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:06,806
- No! 
 - What?

350
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:10,124
It is too dark there.
 I need light.

351
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:12,042
Please!

352
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:14,283
Okay, okay, calm down.

353
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:18,010
Look there. It's a good place.

354
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,291
Here you'll be fine. Wait for me.

355
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:25,330
- But ... 
 - Relax.

356
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:28,963
I only go to warn the herd.
 Tobermory will stay with you.

357
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,291
It'll take a second.

358
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:48,724
Thanks, Tobermory.

359
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:57,325
How terrible. Look at her.
 Not a single hair is tangled.

360
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,132
She must have brushed it hundreds of times.

361
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:03,887
What can we do?

362
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:07,327
How about giving her a prehistoric-style?

363
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:09,848
Knots. I'd say knots.

364
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:13,289
It's a challenge, girls.
 But I know we can do it.

365
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:14,681
At work!

366
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,045
No. Too conventional.

367
00:34:21,213 --> 00:34:23,283
No, no. It has no character.

368
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:26,365
More knots, more knots!

369
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:31,802
No, now it has no charm.

370
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:33,326
It's not our style.

371
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:35,404
I told you, knots.

372
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:43,247
- It does have class!
 - Well, girls. We totally did it!

373
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:44,926
The knots will always work.

374
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:48,724
- A child! - And he's awake.

375
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,603
He has seen too much.

376
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:55,133
- Tobermory, help! 
- Look at that!

377
00:34:57,573 --> 00:35:01,043
- Shall we do something about it?
 - Absolutely.

378
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:11,283
You must watch out, be alert. 
 And don't get yourself in trouble.

379
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:13,723
Very strange things are happening tonight.

380
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:16,323
I'm counting on you.

381
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:25,408
- Don't move, we can't  concentrate. 
 - You're tickling me.

382
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:29,362
If you stand still, we will turn you into
 a masterpiece of modern art.

383
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:34,402
Tonight there is no time for art. 
 We have an important mission.

384
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:35,369
Let's go, Tim.

385
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,251
This is our work area.

386
00:35:37,413 --> 00:35:40,928
He belongs to us...It is intended to be our...

387
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:44,085
- Leave him!
 - Our masterpiece.

388
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:48,247
- They think I should change my image. 
 - Not tonight.

389
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:51,450
I'm sorry. Maybe we will meet again.

390
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:56,043
Someday we will meet again for sure!

391
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:59,523
-And then... we will do wonders with that hair!

392
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,732
herder, what was that?

393
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:12,453
The hair entanglers. Sometimes they get on my nerves.

394
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:13,966
You know what I mean.

395
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:17,330
I know. But I'm sure it has nothing to do with Nocturna.

396
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:19,085
You think we're in danger?

397
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,813
In danger? Moka makes sure that everything is in order.

398
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,692
- We shouldn't worry.
 - Sure... Moka.

399
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,032
There they are.

400
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:34,049
Okay, my little ones.
 You know what you have to do.

401
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:38,126
Quickly! And your uncle Pei will be proud of you.

402
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:50,123
- How do you know where to go?
 -You always worry too much.

403
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,045
I can go through Nocturna with eyes closed.

404
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:54,886
But I don't understand why
 there is so much fog tonight..

405
00:36:58,013 --> 00:36:58,809
Watch out!

406
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:23,928
Tobermory, are you alright?

407
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:28,326
Cat herder?

408
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:31,285
Cat herder?

409
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:41,487
Hello?!

410
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:58,323
It's... it's a star!

411
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:04,213
Wait, I won't hurt you!

412
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:05,328
I got it!

413
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:09,888
It's the kidnapper! Catch him before he escapes!

414
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:12,088
Kidnapper! 

415
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:14,608
- Kidnapper! ... Kidnapper! ...
 - I am not the...

416
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:23,007
Thglowis time he can't escape.
 We have surrounded him.


417
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:25,641
- Star, what is going on?
 - Star!

418
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:29,169
Why are you calling me 'star',
 you petty criminal?

419
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:31,801
I'll show you what a star is.

420
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:36,323
- No! 
- Stop that kid!

421
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:39,645
He put Murray off. Get him!

422
00:38:44,746 --> 00:38:45,946
Run, Tobermory!

423
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:54,087
What happened...? The kid!

424
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:57,133
Tim! Where is he?

425
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:02,932
Lights?

426
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,332
I'm not a kidnapper, I am Tim!

427
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:15,646
Wait for me, boy!

428
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:17,612
The party has begun!

429
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:08,285
Stand still. You can't pass unpunished.

430
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:15,042
One moment.

431
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:23,605
I told you not to move!

432
00:40:32,253 --> 00:40:35,131
Good cat. Too bad the herder isn't here.

433
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,565
A watermelon?

434
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:50,803
Here!

435
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:57,283
Kidnapper! Kidnapper!...

436
00:40:58,013 --> 00:41:00,811
Kidnapper. We have to spray him.

437
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:04,329
- I did not mean to...
 - He broke the filament!

438
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:06,448
For Murray!

439
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,291
Get away from him!

440
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,293
Nebulae, diverse this fog!

441
00:41:18,213 --> 00:41:20,363
Cat herder, you came to save me!

442
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:23,331
I can't leave you out here
 awake throughout the night.

443
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:25,165
It would look bad on my record.

444
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:28,564
-It's not the kidnapper.
 -It's the boy!

445
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:30,564
Tell me, what's going on?

446
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:33,406
Why do you chase this child?
- We thought it was the kidnapper.

447
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:36,087
Kidnapper, kidnapper...

448
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:40,562
Many of us are gone without a trace.

449
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:43,247
That's why Murray offered himself as bait

450
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:45,608
to try and catch the criminal in the act.

451
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:47,809
And he did it again ...

452
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,726
'It takes more than a blow to put me off...'

453
00:41:50,893 --> 00:41:53,043
- Murray! 
 - Hooray!

454
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:56,250
Back, back.
 Don't stay in front of the champion!

455
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,567
I'm sorry. I didn't want to drop you ...

456
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:02,452
I thought you were a star that fell from the sky.

457
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:06,170
Understandable confusion.

458
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:10,964
We should always be in the lampposts and traffic lights, but ......

459
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:14,443
things were getting too bad, so we had to take action.

460
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:17,650
You started to disappear like the stars?

461
00:42:17,813 --> 00:42:18,882
Yes.

462
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:21,408
We're losing the sparkle.

463
00:42:22,853 --> 00:42:25,492
-I don't find it funny.
 -Sorry, champ.

464
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:29,851
I could have sworn it was the kidnapper.
 But if you say he's not, then...

465
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:32,129
Moka sent the boy to find out what's happening...

466
00:42:32,293 --> 00:42:34,249
That's why we can't stay any longer, we gotta go.

467
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:36,611
-Good luck!
 -I'm sorry I broke you.

468
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:41,642
No worries. My mother always told me that one day 
 I would break my head.

469
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:45,849
- See you, guys!
 - Goodbye!

470
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:48,208
I said ... wait!

471
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:52,803
Night report:
we are overwhelmed.

472
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:55,441
Half of the city is in the dark
 and nobody knows why.

473
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:57,763
Increasing complaints from trade unions

474
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:59,491
and many accidents because of poor visibility

475
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:02,247
The streets are not safe, 
the crickets want to strike

476
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:06,486
and those who normally make others sleep... 
 have abanonned the asleep ones.

477
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:09,452
Pardon me, sir.

478
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:12,081
Everyone is asking
 a lot of questions

479
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:15,689
about light and ... about this shadow.

480
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:19,132
What?...

481
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:20,327
Sorry!

482
00:43:20,693 --> 00:43:24,322
Questions, questions.
 And who answers my questions?

483
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:25,972
I'm here! Done.

484
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:27,203
So?

485
00:43:27,373 --> 00:43:29,568
Finished, boss. Perfect.

486
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:34,170
That's... wonderful.
 It could not get any better.

487
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:37,405
Guess who will soon have a ...

488
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,326
A raise, a raise, boss?

489
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,812
- A problem... 
 - What?

490
00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:44,009
...with the Cat herder!
 - How did you do it?

491
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:49,162
I never thought of
 having to do that "thing".

492
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:54,043
- It's time ... 
 - Do you really want me to do that "thing"?

493
00:43:54,813 --> 00:43:55,802
Yes.

494
00:43:56,413 --> 00:44:01,282
And remember. If it fails, it
 may be too late.

495
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:12,371
It's enough for today.

496
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:17,646
Let's go down, guys.

497
00:44:35,413 --> 00:44:37,210
This is the entrance to the harbor.

498
00:44:40,293 --> 00:44:42,284
Soon we reach the lighthouse.

499
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:46,643
Look, how many stars
 and lights are gone.

500
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:51,331
- And it's very dark. 
- You were right. Something is happening.

501
00:44:51,493 --> 00:44:55,122
- Forgive me for not believing you.
 - What happens if all the stars disappear?

502
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:59,047
This can't happen.
 It's impossible. If there were no stars ...

503
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:03,931
- What would happen?
 - I think ... Nocturna would disappear.

504
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,883
And what will happen with you,
 with your cats, with Moka

505
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:10,487
and with the hair entanglers?
- We are part of Nocturna.

506
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:15,886
But... You can't disappear.
 I don't wanna be alone again.

507
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:20,843
But what are you saying, now you worry about us?
 I thought you didn't like the night.

508
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:23,846
Anyway, I promise I won't disappear.

509
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,846
Not while there are still weird children 
 they don't want to go to bed.

510
00:45:30,173 --> 00:45:34,246
Don't worry. We will restore
 the stars in their place.

511
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:37,485
- It seems that they are very important for you. 
- Of course they are.

512
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:40,451
Mom told me once that all of us have one.

513
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,764
Just pick one
 then look at the sky

514
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:45,969
and see how it shines.

515
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:49,731
You'll never feel lonely at night,
 because your star is with you,

516
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:52,646
protecting you from the darkness.

517
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:57,649
She told me she would always be here,
 but now... not anymore.

518
00:45:58,293 --> 00:46:01,968
Don't worry. I will not leave 
 you alone. I promise.

519
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:05,569
The stars will shine again
 before dawn comes.

520
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:09,851
- We are a good team, right?
 - Do you mean ... you and me?

521
00:46:10,013 --> 00:46:13,688
Sure! You saw how we ran
 faster than the lights

522
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,526
and how we managed to
 stop them? True, Tobermory?

523
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:20,369
I don't know why I keep trying.
 It's useless.

524
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,770
Come, let's go!

525
00:47:13,653 --> 00:47:14,768
Coming, herder!

526
00:47:37,573 --> 00:47:42,124
- Thanks for saving me.
 - We are a team, right?

527
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:45,365
Yes, yes, more or less...

528
00:49:00,653 --> 00:49:01,972
This way.

529
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:16,852
There we are! The bridge connects
 the pier to the lighthouse.

530
00:49:17,013 --> 00:49:18,844
We'll be there in a moment.

531
00:49:19,013 --> 00:49:20,969
- We did it! - Almost.

532
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:24,250
I begin to understand why Moka
 picked you for this mission.

533
00:49:24,413 --> 00:49:26,404
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

534
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:30,452
Well, Cat herder...
 I just wanted to tell you that ...

535
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:32,889
What's happening?

536
00:49:36,013 --> 00:49:38,402
Another time. Please.

537
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:46,688
All your cats!

538
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:49,086
What are you doing here?

539
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:51,892
You should have stayed in town.
 I told you it was dangerous.

540
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:54,927
Why have you followed us?
 Why are you so nervous?

541
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,732
Try to calm down. Calm down!

542
00:49:59,693 --> 00:50:01,206
Silence!

543
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:07,247
There...

544
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:10,007
there are children crying.

545
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:14,805
They're all awake.

546
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:17,249
This is why the cats came
 looking for us.

547
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:19,082
But why...?

548
00:50:20,293 --> 00:50:23,490
All the children are awake. I don't know what
 is happening. I must go back.

549
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:27,282
- You're going? 
- This is not normal, I have to fix it.

550
00:50:27,453 --> 00:50:30,490
But you can't leave me now.
 We are very close.

551
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,962
Don't you understand? It's my job.

552
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:36,921
What will Moka think of me if I leave
 the children up all night?

553
00:50:37,093 --> 00:50:40,369
You only care about your job and
 what Moka might think.

554
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:44,811
He didn't even listen to me
 when I tried to tell him about the stars.

555
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:48,569
So... what about the card...?
He didn't give it to you himself, did he?

556
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:51,201
We are here without his permission.

557
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:54,930
- You lied to me, Tim.
 - He would not listen to me.

558
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,722
You've seen all the stars,
 the lights and the shadow.

559
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:02,283
Who knows what would have happened later.

560
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:06,442
- Stay here, you can't come with me
- But you said you would't leave me alone.

561
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:09,002
This was a lie too.

562
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:11,965
I'll return to you soon,
 but when I finish

563
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:14,931
this time I'll take you where
 you should have stayed and sleep.

564
00:51:25,813 --> 00:51:29,852
We won't remain here waiting
 while the stars are disappearing.

565
00:51:30,293 --> 00:51:33,285
We don't need anyone,
 we don't need anyone.

566
00:51:56,453 --> 00:51:58,603
You two - there!

567
00:51:59,213 --> 00:52:00,965
The others - follow me!!

568
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:08,605
There's no time to lose.
You there, on that balcony.

569
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:28,804
Let's go, Tobermory.

570
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:31,930
Don't be so lazy.

571
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:51,931
It seems there's no one...

572
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:55,051
Star Keeper?

573
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:56,971
Star Keeper!

574
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,725
Star kee...

575
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:32,563
You will not believe this, but I think
 I saw someone up there ..

576
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:34,689
yes, sure, Ted...

577
00:53:45,093 --> 00:53:47,209
You two stay at your place.

578
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:50,124
I think everything is under control.

579
00:53:55,293 --> 00:53:57,602
What are you doing here, girls?
 Any problems?

580
00:53:57,773 --> 00:54:01,243
Problem? We couldn't mess up anyone's hair
 properly.

581
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:05,008
- All the children have gone mad.
- Because of that worm.

582
00:54:05,173 --> 00:54:08,051
Calm down, tell me,
 who are you talking about?

583
00:54:08,213 --> 00:54:11,046
Who? Who else? Pei!

584
00:54:11,213 --> 00:54:16,207
- He has awakened them all. 
 - I want to wipe that smile off his face.

585
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:18,204
Pei? For what reason?

586
00:54:18,373 --> 00:54:21,683
I think I should tell Moka
 of all this.

587
00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:29,166
Star Keeper?
Star Keeper!

588
00:54:31,693 --> 00:54:34,651
- Star Keeper?
- Who's there?

589
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:39,409
Finally, someone came.
 I was starting to despair.

590
00:54:39,573 --> 00:54:42,724
- You...are... 
 - A star.

591
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:47,444
- You are beautiful. 
 - Thank you.

592
00:54:47,613 --> 00:54:51,128
- Many only look at my position.
 - And what is your position?

593
00:54:51,293 --> 00:54:54,410
I am the North Star, of course.

594
00:54:54,573 --> 00:54:57,406
The whole world revolves around
 me. I'm not bragging.

595
00:54:58,053 --> 00:54:59,645
- It's the truth. 
 - I know.

596
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:02,532
I watch you every night.
You keep me company.

597
00:55:02,693 --> 00:55:07,164
Especially Adhara. It's my star.
 But it suddenly disappeared.

598
00:55:07,613 --> 00:55:09,922
Impossible. The stars will not disappear.

599
00:55:10,093 --> 00:55:11,811
We are here for thousands of years.

600
00:55:12,173 --> 00:55:15,165
I think there's a blackout. We must
 use the emergency switches.

601
00:55:15,893 --> 00:55:19,602
- Emergency switch?
- All the stars have one.

602
00:55:19,773 --> 00:55:22,367
I don't get there. But here behind
 I have my emergency switch.

603
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:24,970
Do you see it?

604
00:55:25,133 --> 00:55:28,205
We must tell the Star Keeper,
 how to make all the stars shine again.

605
00:55:28,373 --> 00:55:29,488
What Keeper?

606
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:32,213
You know. The one who takes care
 of all the stars

607
00:55:32,373 --> 00:55:34,603
and makes sure that all
 have what they need.

608
00:55:34,773 --> 00:55:37,207
I'm here for millennia, child. 
 Trust me,

609
00:55:37,373 --> 00:55:40,206
there are no people here.
- But...

610
00:55:40,573 --> 00:55:42,131
Then, who lives in the lighthouse?

611
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:47,083
No one. You're the first person
 I see here in the lighthouse for centuries.

612
00:55:47,453 --> 00:55:49,648
Now everything is automatic.

613
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:53,886
But Moka said ... 
 Did I come this far for nothing?

614
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:57,644
Who will save the stars?

615
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,849
- How about you? 
- I?

616
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:03,323
Just go to the bridge and turn
 on the stars that don't shine.

617
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,449
You could be the Star Keeper.

618
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,922
Don't you want to make them shine again?

619
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:08,889
Comrades!

620
00:57:09,413 --> 00:57:12,689
We are the last
 light survivors.

621
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:16,641
We must remain united
 against the enemy.

622
00:57:17,213 --> 00:57:19,044
- The kidnapper. - The kidnapper!

623
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:31,607
- Kidnapper, kidnapper...
- Cursed filament.

624
00:57:31,773 --> 00:57:33,286
Kidnapper!

625
00:57:51,573 --> 00:57:55,566
I don't understand. The switch
 doesn't work. What's happening?

626
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:57,883
I don't know. But...

627
00:57:58,653 --> 00:58:02,123
if you din't manage to make it shine again 
 it means...

628
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:05,044
they are dead.

629
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:11,365
No. No. It can't be...

630
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,847
Adhara.

631
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:29,404
No!

632
00:58:52,973 --> 00:58:54,645
Emergency call,
 for all on Nocturna ...

633
00:58:54,813 --> 00:58:57,805
Nocturnians, you have to go
 the tower immediately

634
00:58:57,973 --> 00:59:00,692
Immediately! No one should
 stay out here!

635
00:59:01,293 --> 00:59:02,487
No one!

636
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:07,210
Warning! Protect yourself from the shadow! ...

637
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:13,100
Mr. Moka, thank you
 for receiving me.

638
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:16,170
We must do something.
 Pei has ... What are you doing here?

639
00:59:18,493 --> 00:59:22,372
Leave us alone, Pei. We have
 a lot to talk about. Coffee?

640
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:24,922
I would prefer an explanation.

641
00:59:26,453 --> 00:59:30,890
Adhara. You can't leave me alone.
 You are my star.

642
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:33,444
You must protect me.

643
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:36,531
You must remain with me forever.

644
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:39,088
Tim, what do we do now?

645
00:59:39,253 --> 00:59:43,292
Moka lied to me.
 I must go back.

646
00:59:44,093 --> 00:59:46,812
- Are you sure? 
 - I am now, yes.

647
00:59:47,413 --> 00:59:50,610
Moka knew everything. From the very beginning.

648
00:59:53,933 --> 00:59:55,207
What is this?

649
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:00,108
Tim, what's happening...what's happening?

650
01:00:02,413 --> 01:00:03,084
Quick!

651
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:05,485
Let's get out of here!

652
01:00:09,453 --> 01:00:12,650
He's destroying everything.
 It's terrible.

653
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:15,964
The shadow is growing. And it is more
 dangerous than I thought.

654
01:00:16,573 --> 01:00:20,407
When the last light turn off completely 
 it will be the end of Nocturna.

655
01:00:20,573 --> 01:00:22,131
- We must stop it! 
 - Stop it?

656
01:00:22,293 --> 01:00:25,330
It's too late. Don't you understand
 that this must have been done by the child?

657
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:27,768
Maybe it is so, but I must find him.

658
01:00:27,933 --> 01:00:29,889
I promised not to leave him alone.

659
01:00:30,053 --> 01:00:33,011
- Where do you think you're going?
 - I will not be sitting here.

660
01:00:33,933 --> 01:00:35,207
It's not my style.

661
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:41,482
Good luck, buddy.

662
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,646
Hey, big boy!

663
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,448
I'm here!

664
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:19,207
Murray? You're still standing!

665
01:01:19,373 --> 01:01:22,206
Of course. I am a low-energy light.

666
01:01:22,373 --> 01:01:23,647
You're not going to the meeting?

667
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:26,327
I can't. I must find the child,
 and protect him from the shadow.

668
01:01:26,493 --> 01:01:29,769
From the shadow? Please let me come with you.

669
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:32,242
I have a score to settle
 with that worm.

670
01:01:32,413 --> 01:01:35,644
- No, buddy. It's too dangerous.
 - Trust me ...

671
01:01:35,813 --> 01:01:40,807
An angry light
 doesn't know the word "danger".

672
01:01:44,893 --> 01:01:47,965
- Look! There's the tower of Moka.
 - We did it!

673
01:01:48,653 --> 01:01:51,804
But how do we go down there?
We can't fly.

674
01:01:52,853 --> 01:01:54,650
Says who?

675
01:02:10,973 --> 01:02:12,122
What's happening?

676
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:14,488
We can't work without the stars.

677
01:02:14,653 --> 01:02:17,645
There's hardly any light.
 What's next?

678
01:02:19,253 --> 01:02:23,565
- We want an explanation!
- We want an explanation!

679
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:25,611
Moka is coming.

680
01:02:25,773 --> 01:02:28,606
- Be quiet! 
- How can we be silent?

681
01:02:28,773 --> 01:02:32,846
The shadow is destroying all
 Nocturna. Moka owes us an explanation.

682
01:02:33,013 --> 01:02:34,571
Nocturnians.

683
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:41,402
As you know, we are going
 through a difficult period.

684
01:02:41,573 --> 01:02:44,883
And you would like to know who
 is causing all this.

685
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,772
You all deserve to know
 who is responsible

686
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:51,926
for this disaster, this chaos, 
 for this tragedy.

687
01:02:52,653 --> 01:02:55,645
And then question is
 who sent the shadow

688
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,690
to destroy our night.

689
01:02:57,933 --> 01:03:00,049
And I'll tell you.

690
01:03:00,813 --> 01:03:05,204
The person who has caused all this
 is a child called

691
01:03:05,373 --> 01:03:07,728
- Tim. 
- This is not true.

692
01:03:07,893 --> 01:03:09,611
- Tim? 
- It's a lie.

693
01:03:09,773 --> 01:03:12,333
- The child? 
- Can't be. It's impossible!

694
01:03:12,493 --> 01:03:14,961
The child has brought
 his shadow in Nocturna.

695
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:19,251
But he is not the one responsible
 for the disaster we are going through.

696
01:03:19,893 --> 01:03:24,762
We must not forget that for some
 who sleep this and is a place to fear.

697
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:27,242
The nightmares, the monsters under the bed

698
01:03:27,413 --> 01:03:30,962
the abominable things lurking
 in dark corners. The shadows ..

699
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:32,805
This is how the night is for Tim.

700
01:03:32,973 --> 01:03:36,522
His fear has created this
 monster that now threatens us

701
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:42,211
erasing any trace of light and
 whatever it wants.

702
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,603
We must do something!

703
01:03:58,173 --> 01:04:02,291
No! There's only one way
 to defeat the shadow.

704
01:04:02,453 --> 01:04:04,887
And only one person could do it.

705
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:08,807
He must overcome his fear
 to face the shadow.

706
01:04:08,973 --> 01:04:12,488
And he must find the courage 
 to do it alone.

707
01:04:12,653 --> 01:04:14,848
No one should interfere.

708
01:04:15,013 --> 01:04:19,882
I wanted Tim to travel
 alone to Nocturna.

709
01:04:20,053 --> 01:04:22,806
But I have failed, I'm sorry.

710
01:04:22,973 --> 01:04:24,804
Eclipse, eclipse!

711
01:04:25,173 --> 01:04:27,050
It's eating the moon!

712
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:32,762
Look!

713
01:04:39,933 --> 01:04:41,889
It's too late.

714
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,162
Tim is in danger.

715
01:04:48,293 --> 01:04:51,683
Easy, big guy.
 Sure the boy is OK.

716
01:04:52,413 --> 01:04:55,485
Look there! It's another survivor!

717
01:05:09,933 --> 01:05:11,889
It's eating everything.

718
01:05:12,053 --> 01:05:15,489
All the stars, the lights ...
 And now the moon..

719
01:05:15,653 --> 01:05:19,726
All the light.
 You're the last star.

720
01:05:20,413 --> 01:05:21,687
And if you disappear ...

721
01:05:22,653 --> 01:05:24,883
Do you think that 
 I brought the shadow?

722
01:05:25,053 --> 01:05:26,645
I believe in you, Tim.

723
01:05:26,813 --> 01:05:29,805
You wouldn't do this.
 You care about us.

724
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,527
Cat herder!

725
01:05:40,693 --> 01:05:44,732
- It's Tim! 
- I told you.  I knew he was fine.

726
01:05:44,893 --> 01:05:46,849
herder! herder!

727
01:05:47,013 --> 01:05:49,083
This child is a survivor, 
 like me ...

728
01:05:55,753 --> 01:05:57,186
It's going towards Tim.

729
01:05:59,933 --> 01:06:02,527
Cat herder, it's me!...

730
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:11,245
- I hope you have a plan.
 - Now we'll see.

731
01:06:15,493 --> 01:06:17,449
I don't think it's the best plan.

732
01:06:18,493 --> 01:06:21,832
Look at this delicious piece of light,
 little that's left of it. 

733
01:06:26,173 --> 01:06:28,564
We did it!
 He has forgotten the star.

734
01:06:28,653 --> 01:06:31,213
Maybe it's time
 we worried about us.

735
01:06:39,613 --> 01:06:40,682
Where did it go?

736
01:06:43,453 --> 01:06:46,126
It's right behind us!
 Run! Run!

737
01:07:23,893 --> 01:07:25,531
Okay, come on.

738
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:29,652
Come, go ahead, get me, I'm waiting.
 Come on, don't be shy.

739
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:31,485
Come on, let's go!

740
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:43,003
Come on. Don't pull
 back now.

741
01:07:43,173 --> 01:07:44,492
Come!

742
01:07:45,613 --> 01:07:46,966
Hey you, worm!!

743
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:48,652
Get back here! Don't go away!

744
01:07:49,173 --> 01:07:51,892
Don't you see how appetizing I am?

745
01:07:55,013 --> 01:07:57,846
So sorry, I failed.

746
01:07:58,013 --> 01:07:59,924
There's no time now to complain.

747
01:08:01,053 --> 01:08:04,170
Listen, we have to hide,
 we must find a safe place

748
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:07,450
where the shadow won't 
 even think to look for us.

749
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:11,645
There is no such place.

750
01:08:12,653 --> 01:08:13,802
Not anymore.

751
01:08:26,733 --> 01:08:28,325
Now where do you think you're going?
Don't even dare ...

752
01:08:49,413 --> 01:08:50,846
Tim, don't be afraid.

753
01:08:53,293 --> 01:08:54,885
- He needs you! 
 - I can't...

754
01:08:55,053 --> 01:08:56,247
Trust me.

755
01:08:57,693 --> 01:08:59,923
You must....confront it.

756
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:02,485
You gotta do something!

757
01:09:06,413 --> 01:09:08,927
You have to face it!

758
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:11,169
herder!

759
01:09:12,893 --> 01:09:17,205
Here, you monster! Face one of your size!

760
01:09:24,853 --> 01:09:28,402
Cat herder, you'll be fine. 
 I know you'll be fine.

761
01:09:29,093 --> 01:09:32,483
I am so sorry, I didn't come to help you.

762
01:09:33,013 --> 01:09:37,484
You can still do it. You're the only one who can save Nocturna.

763
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:38,688
What?

764
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:41,925
Look at me. I can't do it all alone.

765
01:09:42,093 --> 01:09:46,052
- I'm scared.
- What are you afraid of?

766
01:09:46,493 --> 01:09:48,529
Now you know Nocturna.

767
01:09:49,013 --> 01:09:51,368
You never see us, but we're always here.

768
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:53,410
There's nothing to be afraid of.

769
01:09:54,213 --> 01:09:58,889
Those who love you will never leave you. 
 You always carry them with you.

770
01:10:00,773 --> 01:10:02,604
Even when they are no more.

771
01:10:06,613 --> 01:10:07,568
No!

772
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,131
Don't leave me!

773
01:10:11,813 --> 01:10:15,203
Cat herder...
Cat herder...

774
01:10:34,693 --> 01:10:36,809
We must go away from here.

775
01:10:41,693 --> 01:10:45,129
- What are you doing? Run!
 - There's nowhere to run to.

776
01:10:46,933 --> 01:10:48,286
Is this what you want?

777
01:10:51,773 --> 01:10:54,810
If I have no fear, you can't exist!

778
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:07,006
North Star?

779
01:11:08,653 --> 01:11:10,325
I hope this works.

780
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:19,727
- Are you ok? 
 - I'm...

781
01:11:20,373 --> 01:11:23,683
- I'm shining. 
 - How beautiful...

782
01:11:51,453 --> 01:11:54,206
- Tim, are you alright? 
 - Yes.

783
01:11:54,813 --> 01:11:58,328
He's gone.
 But he'll always be with me.

784
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:02,445
What a trip!

785
01:12:02,613 --> 01:12:03,568
Tobermory, Murray!

786
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:08,208
Thank you for your help, my friends.

787
01:12:09,013 --> 01:12:12,562
Look at the sky!
 We did ??it!

788
01:12:18,973 --> 01:12:21,441
- Come on, guys. 
 - Time for work.

789
01:12:54,613 --> 01:12:56,410
How was your night, champ?

790
01:12:56,573 --> 01:13:00,691
Quite busy. That shadow caused
 some problems, but in the end ...

791
01:13:00,853 --> 01:13:03,208
Yes, sure, sure. 

792
01:13:14,373 --> 01:13:17,570
- Now everything is back in its place.
 - Almost.

793
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:19,132
Your place is up there...

794
01:13:19,733 --> 01:13:22,167
Thank you for saving me,
 for saving us all...

795
01:13:23,693 --> 01:13:26,651
It was great being with you.
 Please say hello to Adhara.

796
01:13:27,213 --> 01:13:29,443
And tell thanks for
 being there every night.

797
01:13:29,733 --> 01:13:32,805
- Goodbye!
 - I'll be watching you!

798
01:13:46,133 --> 01:13:49,205
I know, I know, time to sleep now.

799
01:13:54,053 --> 01:13:55,850
You have been a perfect guardian.

800
01:13:56,013 --> 01:13:58,925
I'm sure the Cat herder would be very proud of you.

801
01:14:22,253 --> 01:14:25,165
I just want to thank everyone.

802
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:28,928
It's been a very long and heavy night.
 We deserve a good rest day.

803
01:14:38,653 --> 01:14:42,202
- Come on!
 - Pass it on, pass it!

804
01:14:45,933 --> 01:14:47,843
- It's Tim. 
 - It's not possible.

805
01:14:50,613 --> 01:14:51,932
He's got the ball! 

806
