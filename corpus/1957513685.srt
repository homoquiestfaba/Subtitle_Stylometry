1
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:36,364
There have been many werewolves
in literature and film,

2
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:39,325
but the defining popular image
of the classic werewolf

3
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:43,525
comes from Universal's <i>The Wolf Man,</i>
starring Lon Chaney.

4
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:48,158
This is a replica of the wolf's-head cane
that's featured prominently in the film.

5
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:51,922
Unlike the original prop,
this one's made of genuine silver,

6
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,601
so you could actually kill a real werewolf.

7
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:14,236
The rules and regulations surrounding
werewolves and the wolf man

8
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:16,966
owe less to folklore
than to the fertile imagination

9
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:20,676
of screenwriter Curt Siodmak,
who took over an abandoned project

10
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:23,998
once intended for Boris Karloff
and made it his own.

11
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:27,841
Lon Chaney also put his uniquely
personal imprint on the character.

12
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:30,725
The wolf man is the only
classic Universal monster

13
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:34,880
played by one actor alone
over a series of five films.

14
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:39,677
lnterested in learning more? Then grab
your wolfbane, your silver-tipped cane,

15
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,361
and come along with me
into the Universal vaults,

16
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:46,804
where we'll uncover the secrets
of a monster by moonlight.

17
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:52,279
<i>There's an old poem:</i>
<i>''Even a man who is pure in heart</i>

18
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:54,403
<i>And says his prayers by night,</i>

19
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:56,955
<i>May become a wolf</i>
<i>when the wolfbane blooms</i>

20
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:59,117
<i>And the autumn moon is bright.''</i>

21
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:01,846
<i>- So you know that one, too, huh?</i>
<i>- Of course.</i>

22
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:04,077
<i>Everyone knows about werewolves.</i>

23
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:07,476
Legends about people
who cross the boundary

24
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:11,480
between the human and the animal
are as old as recorded history.

25
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:16,083
Primitive cultures often projected human
characteristics onto the animal world,

26
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:19,921
resulting in a rich folklore
of shape-shifting tricksters,

27
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:24,364
monstrous changelings and even
the story of <i>Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

28
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:29,316
ln Victorian times, real human oddities
displaying unusual body hair

29
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:33,559
were frequently presented to the public
as sideshow attractions,

30
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:38,516
missing links between modern civilisation
and its shadowy animalistic past.

31
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:41,565
Wolf people, dog boys
and other fantastic beings

32
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:46,596
became objects of dark fascination
for a public both disturbed and attracted

33
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:49,247
by the theories of Charles Darwin.

34
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:50,840
ln European folklore,

35
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:55,603
the idea of the werewolf was intimately
linked with the legend of the vampire.

36
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:58,326
The Victorian novelist Bram Stoker,

37
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:01,956
a contemporary of both
Charles Darwin and P T Barnum,

38
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:07,246
combined both legends in the title
character of his classic novel <i>Dracula.</i>

39
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:13,281
<i>Listen to them.</i>

40
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,676
<i>Children of the night.</i>

41
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:19,117
<i>What music they make.</i>

42
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:27,400
Dracula's affinity for wolves went
far beyond mere musical appreciation.

43
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,285
<i>Did you see the look on his face?</i>
<i>Like a wild animal!</i>

44
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,642
<i>Wild animal? Like a madman!</i>

45
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:39,955
<i>What's that, running across the lawn?</i>
<i>Looks like a huge dog!</i>

46
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:41,196
<i>Or a wolf?</i>

47
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,438
ln <i>Dracula,</i> the studio
was extremely reticent

48
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:47,246
in depicting human
animal transformations,

49
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,639
which occurred only
in discreet cutaways, if shown at all.

50
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:54,719
But following the success
of Universal's <i>Frankenstein,</i>

51
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:59,039
Hollywood woke up to the commercial
potential of spectacular horror make-ups,

52
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:00,765
the more beastly the better.

53
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:04,840
<i>lsland of Lost Souls</i> featured a whole
stampeding herd of animal people,

54
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:08,556
including Bela Lugosi
as the Sayer of the Law.

55
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:12,003
<i>You made us in the house of pain.</i>

56
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:18,644
<i>You made us ''thing''.</i>

57
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,798
<i>Not man.</i>

58
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:25,918
<i>Not beast.</i>

59
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:32,440
<i>Part-man, part-beast.</i>

60
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:35,599
<i>- Thing.</i>
<i>- Thing. Thing.</i>

61
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:38,440
<i>- Part-man.</i>
<i>- Part-beast.</i>

62
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:46,959
Eager to develop a new project
for its horror superstar, Boris Karloff,

63
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:51,518
Universal toyed with a screen story
called ''The Wolf Man'' by Robert Florey,

64
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:53,359
a French émigré director

65
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:56,962
deeply committed to the principles
of European expressionism.

66
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,278
ln Florey's striking treatment,
set in the Bavarian Alps,

67
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:04,724
Christoph, a boy kidnapped and raised by
wolves who had slaughtered his family,

68
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:07,162
becomes a werewolf upon his rescue.

69
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:12,082
But the ensuing story, including his
animal transformation in a confessional,

70
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,159
was considered too extreme
by Universal executives,

71
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:18,603
who worried about the reaction
of the Catholic Church.

72
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:22,077
<i>Werewolf of London,</i>
produced by Universal in 1935,

73
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:25,796
originally began as a variation
of <i>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,</i>

74
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,482
but soon began sprouting aspects
of Florey's ''Wolf Man''.

75
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:45,405
lt also took liberal inspiration from
James Whale's <i>The lnvisible Man,</i>

76
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:48,206
especially in the person
of a busybody landlady

77
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:51,518
who lets rooms to a scientific monster.

78
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:55,202
<i>What would you say if l were</i>
<i>to tell you that it was possible</i>

79
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:58,199
<i>for a man to turn into a werewolf?</i>

80
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:02,166
<i>l'd say l was Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

81
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:08,199
The noted stage actor Henry Hull
played Dr Wilfred Glendon,

82
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:12,041
an English botanist who becomes
infected with the curse of the full moon

83
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:15,119
during a research expedition to Tibet.

84
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:29,279
The original werewolf, Dr Yogami,
played by Warner Oland,

85
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:32,325
follows Glendon to London
in pursuit of the rare plant

86
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,399
that can provide
a temporary antidote for lycanthropy.

87
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:38,684
<i>Yogami, you brought this on me.</i>

88
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,156
<i>That night in Tibet.</i>

89
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:43,556
<i>Sorry l can't share this with you.</i>

90
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,842
<i>Remember this, Dr Glendon:</i>

91
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:53,482
<i>the werewolf instinctively</i>
<i>seeks to kill the thing it loves best.</i>

92
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:04,199
Once more concerned about the censors,
the studio took pains to make sure

93
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:09,759
that the werewolf transformations
weren't too horrifying or too hairy.

94
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,476
A very different make-up.
A much more subtle make-up.

95
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,766
l've heard people describe it
as the Elvis werewolf,

96
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:21,522
because he had this little widow's peak
and these sideburn things.

97
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,961
l did see a picture once
that was supposed to have been

98
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:40,005
a make-up test for
the werewolf of London.

99
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:44,239
lt looked much more like the wolf man,
the Lon Chaney Junior make-up.

100
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:49,117
lt was a much hairier face
and a kind of a dog snout.

101
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:52,722
And l don't know why they changed it.
lt was probably some executive.

102
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,765
Or maybe they were afraid.
Maybe they thought it was too much.

103
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:59,396
You gotta pull back.
That happens to me sometimes.

104
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,446
The make-up artist who created
the werewolf of London was Jack Pierce,

105
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:07,076
the man responsible for all
of Universal's classic monsters.

106
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,080
He got his start at Universal
when silent superstar Lon Chaney,

107
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:16,002
the legendary ''man of a thousand faces''
who created all of his own make-ups,

108
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:20,239
walked off the set of the lavish
costume drama <i>The Man Who Laughs.</i>

109
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:26,440
The task of creating a masklike grin
for actor Conrad Veidt fell to Pierce,

110
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:31,521
who quickly became Universal's
official sculptor of living gargoyles.

111
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:34,963
Chaney had a son named Creighton
who also wanted to act,

112
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,959
but his father strenuously
opposed the idea.

113
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:40,607
After the older Chaney's untimely death,

114
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,919
Creighton began acting under his own
name and later, under studio pressure,

115
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,316
as Lon Chaney Junior.

116
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,477
Chaney scored an acting triumph

117
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,843
in the film version
of Steinbeck's <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

118
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:55,600
But the role of
the simple-minded, hulking Lennie

119
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:58,440
typecast him in other hulking roles.

120
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:02,884
At Universal, ''hulking'' meant
one thing and one thing only:

121
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,923
monsters.

122
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:09,558
ln <i>Ghost of Frankenstein,</i> Chaney proved
he could fill Boris Karloff's shoes -

123
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,478
at least in the wardrobe sense.

124
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:15,879
But the following year, Universal
gave Chaney his own signature role

125
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:19,755
that would complete the studio's stable
of classic horror characters:

126
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:23,362
Larry Talbot, aka the wolf man.

127
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:28,362
The title's called <i>The Wolf Man.</i> But that's
not our title - it belongs to Boris Karloff.

128
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:32,360
But he cannot play in it
because he has another assignment.

129
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,165
But we have Lon Chaney.

130
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:36,966
Chaney was backed up
by a distinguished cast,

131
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:41,199
including Claude Rains, Ralph Bellamy,

132
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:45,075
Evelyn Ankers, Patric Knowles,

133
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:50,480
Bela Lugosi and, in a part that would
become her own signature screen role,

134
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:54,924
Maria Ouspenskaya
as Maleva, the Gypsy crone.

135
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:58,443
Chaney's most dramatic support
didn't come from another actor,

136
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,246
but rather from
make-up artist Jack Pierce,

137
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:05,002
who contributed one of
his most inspired creations.

138
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,806
Again, Lon Chaney Junior
had that thankless job

139
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:12,517
of sitting in the make-up chair and having
all these torturous things put on him.

140
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,837
lt's funny, the things l read about Pierce.

141
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,725
He would say he didn't like
using rubber pieces.

142
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:22,164
He would fabricate things out of his kit,
and that was how the make-up was done.

143
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,363
But the wolf man has a rubber nose.

144
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:29,965
l think it was made by Ellis Burman Sr,
who made rubber props at the time.

145
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:36,122
So the wolf man's snout
was a nose piece that came like this.

146
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:39,961
And you can very clearly see
the edges of it through most of the film.

147
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,686
Because he used materials
much less flexible

148
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,327
than those make-up artists employ today,

149
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:48,479
Pierce didn't try to create
realistic wolf features,

150
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,842
which would have been stiff
and unconvincing.

151
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:55,921
Rather, he used small appliances which
only suggested a wolf's face and snout,

152
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:59,841
while allowing Chaney to retain
facial mobility and expression.

153
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,600
The result was uniquely frightening.

154
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:13,880
The hair was yak hair, l believe,
which is hair that we still use today.

155
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,596
lt's a nice coarse hair,
which was laid onto his face.

156
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:21,236
You would paint spirit gum onto the face,
with hunks of this hair -

157
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:25,843
lay it on, cut if off, keep laboriously
building up layers of hair,

158
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,521
as they would do beards
in those days as well.

159
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:33,601
Then he would singe the hair with a hot
curling iron - he would dress it first,

160
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:37,805
and then heat up the iron too much and
singe it to give it more of an animal look.

161
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:41,926
He had rubber gloves that had hair on,
and the rubber feet that he wore as well.

162
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,157
And the teeth, of course, the lower teeth.

163
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,477
lt had to be
an uncomfortable make-up to wear.

164
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:52,563
The spirit gum and the coarse hair glued
to your face is not a comfortable thing.

165
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:56,037
l know. l've made myself up
like that many times.

166
00:11:56,127 --> 00:12:01,201
And l know that Pierce and Chaney
would butt heads somewhat.

167
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:05,121
Lon Chaney Junior was
a much bigger man than Jack Pierce,

168
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:08,005
and l'm sure he didn't like
sitting in the chair.

169
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:12,285
ln fact, l've seen a photo of him making
a fist like he was gonna punch Jack.

170
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,927
And l'm sure he really felt
like that many times.

171
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:19,000
l went to the commissary
and poor Lon Chaney was down there.

172
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:23,922
Took him six hours to put on the make-up
and three hours to take it off.

173
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:28,683
He was sitting at a little table by himself.

174
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,327
And he glowered at me
and wanted to kill me.

175
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:33,875
l said ''Don't kill a poor rat
who just does his job.''

176
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:40,361
''Why don't you kill Jack Pierce who made
you into a wolf man? Leave me alone.''

177
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,200
Something that fascinated me
about werewolf movies,

178
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:46,757
or even ''Jekyll and Hyde'' films,
was the transformation.

179
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:51,875
And many times what they did in
those days was a series of lap dissolves.

180
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,527
Chaney Junior would have to sit
in the same place -

181
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,043
he was fortunately in a chair
when you saw the big transformation -

182
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:03,645
you would put a little bit of make-up on,
photograph a little bit of the scene,

183
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:06,195
add a bit more make-up,
photograph a bit more,

184
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,962
and overlap the two pieces of film.
They'd fade out one and fade in the other.

185
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:13,244
So he would always move a little bit.

186
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:17,366
They perfected it later on
in some of the later movies.

187
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,836
<i>Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man</i>
had a nice one.

188
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:23,283
He's in the hospital bed
and his head is on a pillow.

189
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:26,677
l'm sure it was a plaster pillow
that he could fit perfectly in

190
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,156
like a mould of the back of his head.

191
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,886
And l understand they actually used

192
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:38,042
a big-format still camera,
and they had a front view and a side view,

193
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:42,757
and they actually traced a profile
to try to make sure he lined up better.

194
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,886
l think Pierce's downfall -
and l think this is such a sad story,

195
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:53,236
and it's something that
l learned from Jack's mistakes -

196
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:55,716
was that he didn't progress
with the times.

197
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:59,880
He was continuing to do
these out-of-the-kit make-ups

198
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:03,596
when at other studios people
were doing make-ups with new materials.

199
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,996
They were making
foam-rubber appliances.

200
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:10,046
<i>The Wizard of Oz</i> was one of the first
foam-rubber-appliance films.

201
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:13,517
lt sped up the process
and it kept the continuity better.

202
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:17,885
lt was more comfortable for the actors
and took a lot less time to make them up.

203
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:21,437
Pierce would continue to use the same
cotton and collodion techniques.

204
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:26,601
He eventually was booted out,
like Dr Pretorius, out of the studio.

205
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:32,842
After he created these films
that helped save that studio,

206
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:38,240
he was very unceremoniously fired.

207
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:42,366
And then they brought in Bud Westmore
to be the department head

208
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:46,360
who, in <i>Abbott & Costello</i>
<i>Meet Frankenstein,</i> used foam rubber.

209
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:49,041
They used a foam-rubber nose
for Chaney Junior,

210
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:53,518
they used a foam-rubber forehead, from
under the brow to the top of the head,

211
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:55,484
for Glenn Strange, the monster,

212
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:58,764
and greatly sped up
the whole make-up process.

213
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:02,237
And l always felt that Jack
was unrecognised for most of his life.

214
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:06,957
Even though he got that credit on the film,
l felt he didn't get the credit he deserved,

215
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,446
in the public's eyes.

216
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:12,361
But he kept this amazing scrapbook
that had every letter ever sent to him,

217
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:14,756
and all these articles
that were done on him.

218
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,396
And it gave me a different impression.
He was recognised in his time.

219
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:23,322
There were articles about him
calling him this make-up genius.

220
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:29,039
But unfortunately he had
that sad departure from the studio

221
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:31,846
and that must have been
a very difficult time for Jack,

222
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,522
to have been the head of that department
and the make-up god at that studio

223
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:37,837
and all of a sudden
to be looking for work.

224
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,600
Screenwriter Curt Siodmak
used only the title

225
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,326
of Robert Florey's original
''Wolf Man'' treatment,

226
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,875
and created his own werewolf mythology,

227
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:49,482
very little of which
was based on actual folklore.

228
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:55,756
Basically, all of my pictures have
some scientific background, somewhere,

229
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:59,999
which makes them authentic.
That's why they are still alive today.

230
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:04,763
Siodmak, who had fled Hitler's Germany,
knew full well the real-world significance

231
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:07,919
of people marked for death
with the sign of a star.

232
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,838
<i>What's the matter?</i>

233
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:20,486
<i>l can't tell you anything tonight.</i>

234
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:23,445
<i>Come back tomorrow.</i>

235
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:25,802
<i>What did you see? Something evil?</i>

236
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:29,759
<i>No, no. Now go away.</i>

237
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,958
<i>Go quickly!</i>

238
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,322
<i>- Go!</i>
<i>- Yes!</i>

239
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:37,443
<i>Yes, l'm going!</i>

240
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:45,003
Siodmak was a German Jew
who had had a very successful career,

241
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:49,126
both as a science-fiction author
and as a scriptwriter,

242
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,767
in Germany up until 1933,

243
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:55,078
and, of course, with the advent
of Hitler, had to leave.

244
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:59,206
He spent several years literally on the run.

245
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:04,520
This gave him an appreciation of the fact
that the world is a very unsettling place,

246
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:11,638
a place where a very stable existence
can suddenly turn into total chaos,

247
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:13,763
which is exactly what happened to him.

248
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,917
<i>l'm sick of the whole thing.</i>
<i>l'm getting outta here!</i>

249
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:21,001
<i>Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives</i>

250
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,237
<i>becomes a werewolf himself.</i>

251
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:27,002
This was my wolf-man fate.

252
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:32,763
Wolf-man fate... You might go out of your
house and somebody hits you with a car.

253
00:17:32,847 --> 00:17:35,884
lf you go out one minute later,
nothing happens to you.

254
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:39,642
<i>Qué será, será.</i> We don't know
what is going to happen to us.

255
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:44,118
l think this very much influenced his work
then when he came to the United States

256
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:50,476
and began working in Hollywood,
and specifically for Universal,

257
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:54,719
and specialised then
in science fiction and horror films.

258
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:59,005
And when he was given the assignment
to write <i>The Wolf Man,</i>

259
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:03,842
l think he really felt
that this was his material.

260
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:08,921
When the moon comes up, Larry Talbot -
the name l gave the wolf man -

261
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:11,680
knows he has to become a murderer.

262
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:16,682
ln the Greek tragedies
the gods tell a man his fate.

263
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:21,363
So it is constructed, by chance -
l didn't know it - like a Greek tragedy.

264
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:25,042
His autobiography is...

265
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:30,326
the German title is called
''Under Wolf People''.

266
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:34,480
And that refers to the Germans -

267
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:38,116
not all Germans,
but the Germans who then became Nazis,

268
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,723
who turned from
very likable people into monsters.

269
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,923
ln Siodmak's original script,
the transformations were kept ambiguous

270
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:51,761
and it was never clear whether
Larry Talbot really turned into a wolf

271
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,678
or just imagined he did.

272
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,362
<i>Now, you asked me if l believe</i>
<i>a man can become a wolf.</i>

273
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:01,360
<i>lf you mean ''Can he take on the physical</i>
<i>traits of an animal?'', no, it's fantastic.</i>

274
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:07,920
<i>However, l do believe that most anything</i>
<i>can happen to a man in his own mind.</i>

275
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:10,157
Fortunately for monster fans,

276
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:13,956
the studio ultimately decided
to give the public what it wanted.

277
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:19,246
lt's a horror film, so he doesn't wanna
beat you over the head with the message.

278
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:22,956
lndeed, the film takes place in,
really, a never-never land.

279
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:26,642
There's English gentry
and there's Maria Ouspenskaya,

280
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:30,561
who is a Gypsy straight out
of Romania somewhere,

281
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:34,037
and people drive around
in cars that are modern,

282
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,277
and then there's covered wagons...

283
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:40,360
lt is very much a mixture,
so that it is a never-never land.

284
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:45,567
Actually, in my original script,
Larry Talbot was an American mechanic

285
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:49,356
who went to Scotland
to install a telescope.

286
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:54,157
And they made him the son of a lord.

287
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:58,559
l couldn't even imagine any worse casting

288
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:02,720
than casting Lon Chaney Junior

289
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:06,561
as the son of an English lord,
with his accent.

290
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:08,638
But they did it, and what can l do?

291
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:13,164
All of these films were shot on the
Universal back lot in the European village,

292
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:19,038
which one day would have to
double as a Spanish town,

293
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:22,403
the next day as a German
and the next day as an English village,

294
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:26,366
and they'd change it a bit here and there.
So this amorphous quality

295
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:30,565
definitely has to do with the fact
that it is the Universal back lot.

296
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:36,802
But l think beyond that, the horror films
were supposed to be very unspecific

297
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,685
in terms of the time in which they played.

298
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:46,445
lt helped to reinforce the fact that
this world of horror is not of this world.

299
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:50,042
lt is recognisable as a real place,

300
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:53,961
and yet things happen there
that are very unreal.

301
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:58,120
And that's part of the pleasure
in watching these films.

302
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:02,566
<i>The Wolf Man's</i> impact was
greatly enhanced by topnotch music,

303
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:07,675
the combined effort of Frank Skinner,
Hans Salter and Charles Previn.

304
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,965
Film-music historian John Morgan
and conductor William Stromberg

305
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:16,120
recently undertook an ambitious
reconstruction of the original score.

306
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:19,961
One thing that makes the music
to these horror films stand out

307
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:24,359
compared to a lot of today's that
you would put in the same kind of budget,

308
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:27,757
the B-horror film, is it's real music.

309
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:32,557
They had real composers
that may have not worked on A-budgets,

310
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:37,767
but they were A-composers
working on B-music budgets.

311
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:42,238
And because you have a small orchestra
doesn't mean that you stop thinking

312
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:46,161
or creating or finding ways
of making wonderful music.

313
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:51,196
Today's music - you find a lot of it
is just a long drone,

314
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:54,404
or they have clichés
that they rip off from <i>Psycho,</i>

315
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,762
or the same things over and over again.

316
00:21:56,847 --> 00:22:01,762
They don't get into characters,
they don't get into drama or atmosphere.

317
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:04,964
lt's just a wallpaper put on with a trowel.

318
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:10,679
But this music for films like
<i>The Wolf Man</i> and all the Universal...

319
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:15,522
<i>Bride of Frankenstein,</i> of Franz Waxman...
it's real music.

320
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:20,761
When l'm preparing these scores for our
new recordings, my kids now just love it.

321
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:24,203
They can sing all the main themes
from all these classic films.

322
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:27,757
- Tell them how old they are.
- They're just two and four.

323
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,520
And they can sing the intervals
to <i>The Wolf Man.</i>

324
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:34,566
You could be out there
and they'd go ''Da da daa... wolf man!''

325
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:36,205
- Don't they?
- That's right.

326
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:42,806
<i>The Wolf Man</i> theme itself,
the famous three-note motif,

327
00:22:42,887 --> 00:22:46,516
is outlining the tritone.

328
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:52,284
And in medieval music
it was always the forbidden interval,

329
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:55,677
and it has a connotation
of the devil's interval,

330
00:22:55,767 --> 00:23:01,080
and composers throughout time
would use it to represent something evil.

331
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:11,318
Bela's funeral is a great example
of music written for the film,

332
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:13,523
a very long sequence originally.

333
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:16,679
Portions of the sequence were cut out.

334
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,281
Apparently there was
a very eerie sequence

335
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:24,236
with Bela actually watching
the funeral procession.

336
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:30,436
So the cue is this eight-minute wonderful,
atmospheric piece of music like a dirge.

337
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:35,726
The music is basically a cantus firmus, a
pedal tone, going through the whole cue,

338
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:41,643
where he plays with the motifs
on top of this pedal point.

339
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:45,757
Realising it had killed off
a potentially lucrative new monster,

340
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:49,078
Universal once more called
on screenwriter Curt Siodmak

341
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:50,759
to come to the rescue.

342
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,884
Fortunately, being dead
in a Universal horror movie

343
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:57,357
did not necessarily create story problems.

344
00:23:57,447 --> 00:24:01,042
<i>Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man</i>
was the studio's first pairing

345
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:04,517
of two classic monster characters
in the same film.

346
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:06,962
The opening scene,
in which grave robbers

347
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,925
inadvertently raise
Larry Talbot from the dead,

348
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:14,523
remains one of the most atmospheric
moments in any Universal horror film.

349
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,518
<i>lt looks like he's asleep.</i>

350
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:22,202
<i>He's alive.</i>

351
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:24,278
<i>Help! Help!</i>

352
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:31,766
Not at all happy about
being restored to life,

353
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:36,045
Larry spends most of the film
desperately seeking assisted suicide.

354
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:40,678
He wants to die. But he cannot die,
he knows he cannot die,

355
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:44,965
so he's looking for the man
who knows the secret of life and death.

356
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:48,562
<i>Well, now l want to die too.</i>
<i>Won't you show me the way?</i>

357
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:50,638
<i>l can't.</i>

358
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:55,198
Even Maria Ouspenskaya admits
that Gypsy magic has its limitations,

359
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:58,723
and recommends that Larry consult
a scientific specialist.

360
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:00,877
<i>We might be able to cure you.</i>

361
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:04,562
<i>l only wanna die. That's why l'm here.</i>

362
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:07,764
<i>lf l ever find peace, l'll find it here.</i>

363
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:10,600
<i>Now you understand.</i>
<i>Why don't you help me?</i>

364
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:14,163
<i>Energy which cannot be destroyed</i>
<i>can be transmitted.</i>

365
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:19,367
<i>Well, if that's the case, then the energies</i>
<i>from my body can be drained off also.</i>

366
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:22,678
But the plan to siphon off
the wolf man's life energy

367
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,837
undergoes a last-minute change,

368
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:30,445
and both monsters are restored to their
full power for a titanic wrestling match.

369
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:52,195
ln the next film, <i>House of Frankenstein,</i>

370
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,926
a frozen wolf man
and Frankenstein monster

371
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:57,760
are thawed out
by mad scientist Boris Karloff,

372
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:02,921
who recommends a novel cure
for Larry's curse: a brain transplant.

373
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:05,043
<i>l want to die.</i>

374
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:07,118
<i>Only death can bring me release.</i>

375
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:12,156
<i>You don't have to die, my boy.</i>
<i>You're wrong. l can help you.</i>

376
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,477
<i>Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't...</i>

377
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:17,400
<i>Kill my trusted old assistant?</i>

378
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:22,641
<i>Why, no. l'm going to repay you</i>
<i>for betraying me.</i>

379
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:26,677
<i>l'm going to give</i>
<i>that brain of yours a new home.</i>

380
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:30,157
<i>ln the skull of the Frankenstein monster.</i>

381
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:37,916
<i>As for you, Strauss, l'm going to</i>
<i>give you the brain of the wolf man.</i>

382
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:03,557
While waiting for his new body, Larry
is smitten with a beautiful young Gypsy,

383
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:07,879
who discovers his secret
and takes his cure into her own hands.

384
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:49,083
Larry's death seemed pretty final,

385
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:54,116
so when he turned up again in Universal's
follow-up monsterfest, <i>House of Dracula,</i>

386
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:57,916
no attempt was made
to explain his curious resilience.

387
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:00,043
But some other things were explained.

388
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:03,437
Dracula, we learned,
suffered from a rare blood disease.

389
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:06,439
And the wolf man's problem
wasn't so much the full moon

390
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:08,802
as pressure on the brain.

391
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:13,483
<i>This condition, coupled with your belief</i>
<i>that the moon can bring about a change,</i>

392
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,206
<i>accomplishes exactly that.</i>

393
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:20,758
<i>During the period when your reasoning</i>
<i>processes give way to self-hypnosis,</i>

394
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:24,123
<i>the glands which govern</i>
<i>your metabolism get out of control.</i>

395
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:28,359
<i>When this happens, the glands generate</i>
<i>an abnormal supply of certain hormones,</i>

396
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:32,406
<i>in your case, those which bring about</i>
<i>the physical transformation.</i>

397
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:34,762
And this time a surgical procedure -

398
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:38,362
much less invasive
than the one Boris Karloff had in mind -

399
00:28:38,447 --> 00:28:43,475
actually did the trick, and Larry Talbot
was finally relieved of his curse.

400
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:47,799
Of course, a recovered werewolf
isn't worth very much to a film studio,

401
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:51,197
so when the time came for
Abbott and Costello to meet the monsters,

402
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:55,439
Larry's prior rehabilitation
went discreetly unmentioned.

403
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:59,361
<i>ln half an hour the moon'll rise</i>
<i>and l'll turn into a wolf.</i>

404
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:04,567
<i>- You and 20 million other guys.</i>
<i>- Listen! l might tear you limb from limb.</i>

405
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:06,797
<i>- ls that serious?</i>
<i>- He'll murder you.</i>

406
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:07,637
<i>That's serious.</i>

407
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:10,878
This time the wolf man
was something of a Good Samaritan.

408
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:14,198
Having put up with several
nutty brain doctors in the past,

409
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:19,407
he draws the line at the most dubious
practitioner of them all, Count Dracula.

410
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:23,162
Played by Bela Lugosi
in his last role for a major studio,

411
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:27,206
Dracula ends up assisting
in Larry Talbot's long-sought suicide -

412
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:30,802
though he's not exactly
a willing participant.

413
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:41,602
ln the half-century since
the wolf man's last screen appearance,

414
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,917
he has inspired countless imitations.

415
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:46,999
More recent films
have benefited from larger budgets,

416
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:50,841
wide-screen colour, and highly advanced
make-up and special effects.

417
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:53,395
But no matter how accomplished
these films are,

418
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:56,399
there is still only one Larry Talbot.

419
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:59,446
<i>The way you walked was thorny,</i>

420
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:01,802
<i>through no fault of your own.</i>

421
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:05,366
<i>But as the rain enters the soil,</i>

422
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:08,086
<i>the river enters the sea,</i>

423
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:11,477
<i>so tears run to a predestinate end.</i>

424
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,555
<i>Your suffering is over.</i>

425
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:20,516
<i>Now you will find peace for eternity.</i>

426
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:24,961
The <i>Wolf Man</i> saga was the final addition
to Universal's golden age

427
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:28,596
of classic horror,
a tradition still revered and celebrated

428
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:33,158
by generations of film fans
and film professionals.

429
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:38,685
Especially people of my generation
that grew up with those films on TV,

430
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:42,077
there's a special place
in their heart for them.

431
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:46,877
They may not be the best films in
the world, but they're pretty damn good.

432
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:50,801
And they definitely have inspired
a lot of filmmakers

433
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:53,037
and a lot of make-up effects people,

434
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:57,120
and just a lot of strange people
around the world.

435
00:31:03,647 --> 00:31:07,003
As the wolf man,
Larry Talbot only wanted to die,

436
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:09,396
but somehow the public
just wouldn't allow it.

437
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:12,524
He came back again and again,
in movie after movie,

438
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:16,520
was resurrected on television,
in monster magazines, in model kits,

439
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:20,077
on video cassette and laser disc,
and now on DVD.

440
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:23,000
lt just goes to prove
you can't keep a good monster down.

441
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:26,363
But why would you ever want to?

442
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:28,438
l'm John Landis.
