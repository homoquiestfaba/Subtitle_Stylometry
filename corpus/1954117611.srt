Here too lonely, very lonely,
You do not get any meat eater?

179
00:24:56,873 --> 00:25:00,933
Meat eaters? We call that now?

180
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:07,805
We have met with but Meat Eater
we overcome them quickly.

181
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:15,050
But it is only a matter of time
before they came here.

182
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:20,951
- They have always been so.
- How long have you been here?

183
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:30,837
Difficult'd say, three months,
perhaps more so.

184
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:39,069
- We're one of the survivors.
- Meat Eater?

185
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,906
- No, the prisoner.
- Ricky, indecent interrupt people talking.

186
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,846
You know that.

187
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:46,976
Non-meat eaters.

188
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,955
There is a town in the south of here.

189
00:25:52,893 --> 00:26:00,890
There is an air base.
We plan to go there and flew away.

190
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:06,930
Jerry, good mechanics and
always strive to try.

191
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:11,871
I've been flying in the Air Force,
from the Pacific toward Hawaii.

192
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:15,945
There are islands off the coast of California.

193
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,140
Totally isolated.
No man ever lived.

194
00:26:20,952 --> 00:26:27,858
We plan to start from scratch,
far from any disease.

195
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:33,997
We are not prepared to fight the meat eaters.

196
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:36,998
We are not prepared to deal with them.

197
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:44,940
We kill, we survive from this disease.

198
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:54,976
I do not blame them.

199
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:59,878
They are poisonous and crazy.

200
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,119
They saw us coming,
they were waiting for us.

201
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:10,955
We only source of food for them.

202
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,096
We have prepared a bunch of bull,
to be taken to the slaughterhouse.

203
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:21,975
But we're safe.

204
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:28,811
Thanks to these people.
He has saved us all.

205
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:34,116
We have all been blessed.

206
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:37,822
Meat is delicious, Alisson.

207
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,050
Take the time to eat.

208
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,943
Doors open, man.

209
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,955
Ye who believe

210
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:23,999
So tell me, what should I believe?

211
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:28,872
Believe in good and evil.

212
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:34,069
If you do not believe that a (good),
you are the other (bad).

213
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,878
You believe in the right of that thing huh?
Heaven and Hell?

214
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,049
You Dalan life fairy tale.

215
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:45,921
Go to a tropical paradise,
build sandcastles.

216
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:50,018
If it was not a fairy, what is it?

217
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,992
Hope.

218
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,829
We need hope.

219
00:28:56,932 --> 00:29:01,995
And do not make mistakes. Of course not.

220
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,836
And you will be there.

221
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,938
- There is only one way to escape.
- Really?

222
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:11,037
What is it?

223
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,105
Liberation.

224
00:29:15,883 --> 00:29:18,078
Reclaim the evil we have done.

225
00:29:21,055 --> 00:29:30,861
He is banjingan, but he's right.

226
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:32,090
Everything is ok?

227
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,898
Yes, it's all good.

228
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:45,035
Knife you look great.

229
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,109
I need to work better.

230
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,953
Work?
Meat eaters are killing jobs?

231
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:01,082
Not exactly work,
it's just a way of life.

232
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,027
No one another.

233
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:06,996
Feeling cold and empty.

234
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:10,935
Cold and empty it on my time.

235
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:16,906
Now you have us, probably not much
but at least no friends to talk to.

236
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:23,006
We all feel the loss,
just the same.

237
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:28,818
Maybe talk about hope can help.
Maybe start with journal writing.

238
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:31,047
He's right.

239
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:39,886
I do not like guys who talk a lot.

240
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:45,957
The only thing they can not,
is your soul.

241
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,867
They want to take my soul.

242
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,912
This is very embarrassing.

243
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:47,883
This is very bad.

244
00:31:50,963 --> 00:31:58,802
My car is broken, wounded in the shoulder and
men do not use take everything.

245
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:02,004
I really want to kill him.

246
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:06,975
As I'm saying,
we may have lost the message.

247
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:11,982
You need to find for me, boy.

248
00:32:13,885 --> 00:32:16,046
Please fix it!

249
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,883
I can see her point.

250
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,826
He would make a big mistake.

251
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:07,855
I hope he knows, that's the problem
Meat-eating, he will not fear,

252
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:11,985
and fear
before I tear her heart.

253
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,826
And cut his neck.

254
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:45,084
This is it.

255
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:51,830
Hey, you need help?

256
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:12,019
Murder in a day.

257
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:14,877
Other alcoholic beverages.

258
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:19,086
Many times better than last week.

259
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:22,862
I like your style, man.

260
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,870
Delicious.

261
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,946
You just need me to take this time?

262
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:48,876
Ok.

263
00:36:06,837 --> 00:36:11,934
He cut one of their hands,
then he turned and stabbed one in the neck.

264
00:36:12,075 --> 00:36:14,976
and amputations person.

265
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,846
Very impressive.

266
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:24,877
Its sounds interesting,
what an interesting story.

267
00:36:27,923 --> 00:36:31,017
How many have you killed?
How much?

268
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:33,055
I will be back.

269
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:37,890
I do not know, but still not enough.

270
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:43,029
I'm sure he has a lot to kill today.

271
00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:53,809
So you're going to teach me how
Where be great too?

272
00:36:55,984 --> 00:36:57,042
You have to drink a lot.

273
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:31,837
Why is he going too fast?

274
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:40,946
Stupid whore.

275
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:45,885
Whore ...

276
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:47,902
This is the first time you, too?

277
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:10,046
<i> He did not say "good night" at all. </ i>

278
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:12,950
<i> bitch! </ i>

279
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:17,919
<i> But he certainly knew what he was doing. </ i>

280
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,819
What?

281
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:46,047
I know how you feel.

282
00:41:46,891 --> 00:41:52,022
If you want to talk to
one, my good listener.

283
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,789
I understand the not so choice
First, believe it or not ...

284
00:41:57,901 --> 00:41:59,801
But I understand.

285
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:12,872
- He thinks this "open party" for him?
- Who? Alison?

286
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,873
Yes.

287
00:42:15,884 --> 00:42:18,978
Where there is a way, there are men.

288
00:42:19,888 --> 00:42:24,018
I saw that, let.

289
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,896
So, just do.

290
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:31,055
- Yes, let's do. - Really?
- Yes.

291
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,866
Ok.

292
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:38,836
I would like to do this from day one.

293
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:41,866
Open your shoe. (Laughter)

294
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:45,071
Come on, all right.

295
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:24,872
We should go from here.

296
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,700
What's going on?

297
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:30,046
- He's going to kill me.
- Who?

298
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:37,860
- Where's Jerry?
- I do not know, let's go.

299
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:26,874
Continue interesting.

300
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,771
- Where is Ricky?
- I do not know.

301
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:39,782
Ricky.

302
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,989
Ricky, where are you?

303
00:45:04,811 --> 00:45:07,938
- Ricky.
- What?

304
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:13,984
Ricky, where are you?

305
00:45:18,824 --> 00:45:22,817
- Alison!
- Ricky.

306
00:45:41,012 --> 00:45:45,072
- May I hold the door.
- Hunter where?

307
00:45:45,882 --> 00:45:47,850
I do not know, just keep appealing.

308
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:05,933
Ricky.

309
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:12,872
You think this is funny, huh?

310
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:15,033
No one laughed at Alison.

311
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:24,945
No one.

312
00:46:29,023 --> 00:46:30,991
You'll be ok, Ricky?

313
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,795
Hey, you can handle here?

314
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:39,028
Can you wear pants?

315
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:47,907
- Where is Jesus?
- I do not know.

316
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:51,875
Jesus.

317
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:57,972
Jesus.

318
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:02,020
Damn.

319
00:47:03,923 --> 00:47:05,914
- Run.
- Damn.

320
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,757
Come on.

321
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:47,794
Come on.

322
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:50,956
Hunter.

323
00:48:08,884 --> 00:48:10,818
Come on.

324
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:14,779
Hey, I'm here to play with you.

325
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:18,889
I think you better there.

326
00:48:55,863 --> 00:48:59,764
Let's get out of here.

327
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:03,959
Get out of here, this is mine.

328
00:49:24,922 --> 00:49:25,889
I will show to you.

329
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:30,015
I also know how to play with it.

330
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:57,782
We spend all this.

331
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:04,823
Jesus.

332
00:50:07,028 --> 00:50:10,896
Get out of here.

333
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:16,937
No.

334
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,022
Everything is ok?

335
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:46,925
Ok, thanks for asking, Alison.

336
00:50:48,902 --> 00:50:53,862
<i> Feels like broken bones,
exposed and infected with this damn thing. </ i>

337
00:50:54,013 --> 00:50:56,863
<i> Feels like hell. </ I>

338
00:50:57,777 --> 00:50:59,870
<i> But I'm okay. </ i>

339
00:50:59,946 --> 00:51:03,746
You know about the monster?

340
00:51:03,849 --> 00:51:08,809
I do not know any such thing.
It was awful when it hit us.

341
00:51:08,955 --> 00:51:12,015
Who wants that?

342
00:51:12,857 --> 00:51:17,817
I'm just saying, they are not
easy shot.

343
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:19,931
- Yes.
- Yes.

344
00:51:19,965 --> 00:51:24,834
Damn, that's what I expect.

345
00:51:26,938 --> 00:51:29,964
What The stout?

346
00:51:30,774 --> 00:51:32,901
The stout was gone.

347
00:51:32,977 --> 00:51:36,037
The stout was gone? What's going on?

348
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:44,049
What do we do now?
Where do we go?

349
00:51:44,822 --> 00:51:46,813
Anyone have any suggestions?

350
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:54,819
Gasoline for cars?
Maybe something could fly out there.

351
00:51:55,932 --> 00:52:00,892
- I'm not sure whether it is ready or not.
but I ... - It will fly.

352
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:06,965
- If it can fly, I can fly.
- No one ever thought to look for it?

353
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:11,902
Wait a minute, fuel for aircraft?
Where will you get it?

354
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:16,041
We are not talking about back there again, right?

355
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:21,845
Best what else do we have? We have no
anything since the last months. Things change quickly.

356
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:26,759
Perhaps the city was empty now.

357
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:31,821
Empty? Excuse me. I just do not want the road
night full of danger.

358
00:52:33,034 --> 00:52:34,865
I think we will be killed so easily.

359
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,904
Who was nearly killed?
It almost killed you?

360
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:41,735
- Well
- You are? We even almost killed too!

361
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:45,868
Lyle was dead, Jesus was dead. Go!

362
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:50,905
Please fix myself? Excuse me.
Since when did you take over this, Alison?

363
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:56,845
What do you want? You thought
about other people with your ego?

364
00:52:58,957 --> 00:53:01,858
Girl, you're done?

365
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,823
Jerry, open the truck engine.

366
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:30,750
There is such a thing that can be heard?

367
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:37,054
Install this.

368
00:53:40,897 --> 00:53:41,921
You want it?

369
00:53:42,032 --> 00:53:44,899
Yes, that's only pair.

370
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:50,963
Yes, just like that.

371
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:04,817
What do you do?

372
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:09,946
God. I am not a whore like your sister.

373
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,819
- Excuse me, I just ...
- You just what?

374
00:54:13,895 --> 00:54:18,855
No matter which conveniently you can, right?

375
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,868
Hey, are you okay? Everything okay?

376
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:25,905
Everything is okay, Alison.
Thanks for asking.

377
00:54:25,973 --> 00:54:30,808
Heart feels relieved you care about all of us.

378
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,911
Hey.

379
00:54:42,755 --> 00:54:44,985
Hey, I know you can hear me.

380
00:54:45,892 --> 00:54:48,918
Listen, about yesterday.

381
00:54:49,762 --> 00:54:53,926
I was drunk and did go wrong.

382
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:55,959
What?

383
00:54:57,937 --> 00:55:01,895
What do you mean what? I talked about yesterday.

384
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:07,003
Well, I drank too much and if I had to say something ...

385
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:10,748
Say something?

386
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:12,950
Ok.

387
00:55:13,752 --> 00:55:14,810
Well, just to say something.

388
00:55:15,787 --> 00:55:17,845
Like I say, I drank too much.

389
00:55:17,922 --> 00:55:20,857
Yes, me too.

390
00:55:20,925 --> 00:55:24,827
If your memory back, do not remember it. Ok?

391
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:30,790
If people are drinking a lot,
it does not mean anything.

392
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:39,031
You really do not remember, right?

393
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:46,782
Brock

394
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:12,963
What do you think?

395
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:20,775
Clear, cool and quiet.

396
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:23,783
Let's go.

397
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:03,910
I must admit that this place
not as I expected

398
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:16,993
Are there any?

399
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:21,997
No, there's nothing dry.

400
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:29,003
Hey, make a guess who is doing it?

401
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,806
Terrible.

402
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:52,890
A little advice? Beware,
anything is hiding here.

403
00:57:55,837 --> 00:57:57,998
Waiting for the kill.

404
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:02,903
I often see this scene.

405
00:58:39,045 --> 00:58:40,979
What is it?

406
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:45,716
Get out of here, kid.

407
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:50,787
What's this?

408
00:58:51,857 --> 00:58:53,984
Oh, my God.

409
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:08,872
What's gone wrong.

410
00:59:08,939 --> 00:59:12,932
I think it is not possible at all.

411
00:59:13,744 --> 00:59:16,008
I'm too old to look at things that way.

412
00:59:20,017 --> 00:59:23,850
I think we better get out of here.

413
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,879
Damn, he's right.
We need to go from here.

414
00:59:27,957 --> 00:59:30,755
I told you, but no one
Debbie listened Fast Lane.

415
00:59:30,827 --> 00:59:31,816
So what else are you waiting for?

416
00:59:31,895 --> 00:59:33,954
Gas petrol.

417
00:59:34,764 --> 00:59:35,731
We need gas.

418
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:38,927
You guys, where our trucks?

419
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:47,998
It is now appropriate.

420
00:59:54,983 --> 00:59:57,007
Hey, are you going?

421
00:59:57,785 --> 01:00:00,754
Can you tell us what happened?

422
01:00:00,822 --> 01:00:04,883
You'd spoken nothing
or you just go away?

423
01:00:17,804 --> 01:00:22,764
Hey, do not pretend not to hear me, ok?
Like it or not, we manage together.

424
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,901
So where do you want to go?

425
01:00:25,946 --> 01:00:27,811
We need trucks.

426
01:00:27,948 --> 01:00:30,849
I went looking for the truck.

427
01:00:39,925 --> 01:00:43,725
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

428
01:00:43,963 --> 01:00:47,763
I will follow him. Ricky, you stay here.

429
01:00:47,867 --> 01:00:49,766
- Come on, Alison.
- Staying there, Ricky.

430
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:53,861
Not what you can do,
only remain here.

431
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:12,788
Uh, what's that smell?

432
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:17,950
Take this to be alert.

433
01:01:19,863 --> 01:01:21,728
How about you?

434
01:01:24,967 --> 01:01:28,903
Do not worry about me.

435
01:01:40,016 --> 01:01:41,846
What's this?

436
01:01:43,752 --> 01:01:46,915
Be careful in there.

437
01:01:48,957 --> 01:01:52,859
The atmosphere is very relaxed.

438
01:01:53,728 --> 01:01:54,922
No.

439
01:01:54,996 --> 01:02:04,955
I want to go from here. If we go from here,
The first thing I'm going to strip naked and jump into the sea.

440
01:02:06,006 --> 01:02:08,770
That's very nice.

441
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:11,969
That has happened already.

442
01:02:12,746 --> 01:02:15,840
Debbie, you never had a boyfriend before?

443
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,782
Depends what you mean "boyfriend".

444
01:02:18,885 --> 01:02:23,845
No, I just want to tell me no girlfriend
Maybe we can .. you know

445
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:25,857
I want to get rid of the water.

446
01:02:25,925 --> 01:02:27,825
I can ..

447
01:02:27,894 --> 01:02:31,830
Do not be stupid.

448
01:02:46,979 --> 01:02:50,813
Not as a place to worship huh?

449
01:02:54,852 --> 01:02:56,877
What has happened here?

450
01:02:56,954 --> 01:02:59,980
I'm not sure.

451
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:37,018
Ricky, was it ye?

452
01:03:38,994 --> 01:03:43,795
Do you play there.
I have no mood to play with you.

453
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:50,767
I'm going to kick her butt.

454
01:03:56,811 --> 01:03:58,779
What do they do?

455
01:03:59,914 --> 01:04:03,872
Look at what he did.

456
01:04:07,888 --> 01:04:10,914
Maybe that's what they call it.

458
01:04:17,831 --> 01:04:19,923
Why do you say that?

459
01:04:19,999 --> 01:04:23,799
He just do that for fun.

460
01:04:23,936 --> 01:04:28,771
This guy really difficult thing.

461
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:32,744
What does he?

462
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,943
Let's get out of here.

463
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,951
Was not this the way to get a girl.

464
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:49,785
Hey, I stumbled upon ..

465
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:10,895
Come on, we have to get out of here,
let's go.

466
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:11,937
What's this?

467
01:06:12,005 --> 01:06:14,701
You see something there?
What things do you see?

468
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:15,968
We saw something.
Let's go.

469
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:19,735
Where's Debbie?

470
01:06:28,787 --> 01:06:31,722
Debbie was dead? Not likely.

471
01:06:34,927 --> 01:06:37,987
Let's go.

472
01:06:40,898 --> 01:06:43,696
Ricky, do not let up.

473
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,976
Hurry up, Ricky.

474
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:09,959
Rick, go.

475
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:17,662
Ricky, fast.

476
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:46,851
We are ok

477
01:07:51,832 --> 01:07:53,732
Come here

478
01:08:40,712 --> 01:08:42,906
Take you.

479
01:08:44,748 --> 01:08:47,717
Mad Men.

480
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:17,870
I found the truck.

481
01:09:24,886 --> 01:09:29,846
Hey, what happened there?

482
01:09:32,995 --> 01:09:36,760
Let's move.

483
01:09:43,938 --> 01:09:46,805
Hey, thanks.

484
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:52,707
You saved our lives. Thank you.

485
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:11,760
I have a few scars in my class.

486
01:10:13,966 --> 01:10:16,901
There's a story behind my past.

487
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:26,742
When the last time you made it?

488
01:10:27,912 --> 01:10:31,905
Almost a year.

489
01:10:32,784 --> 01:10:37,721
I did not work long enough.
Just drunk all day.

490
01:10:37,822 --> 01:10:41,724
You know I've been a waste of time?
Why not?

491
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:48,820
Hard to think when thinking about family when you return.

492
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:57,736
I do not know want to start from there.

493
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:03,907
I just want to drink.

494
01:11:04,914 --> 01:11:09,874
Before I knew what had happened,
I shoot all nearby.

495
01:11:14,924 --> 01:11:17,916
Terrible night.

496
01:11:18,793 --> 01:11:23,662
That's the first time I could not go home.

497
01:11:26,768 --> 01:11:31,705
The next morning when I opened the door and
look into the

498
01:11:32,807 --> 01:11:37,766
All decorations scattered on the floor

499
01:11:38,946 --> 01:11:43,906
That's when I knew what had
happened to my family.

500
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:54,749
I want to be there.

502
01:12:09,842 --> 01:12:13,868
I realize that I know my daughter.

503
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:22,753
Lying next to him makes me better.

504
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:29,791
He said, "Happy Birthday, Dad."

505
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:33,693
He's dead.

506
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:40,659
Nothing remains but the
ice cream and cake smeared with blood.

507
01:12:43,941 --> 01:12:48,843
That's the first time I see meat eaters.

508
01:12:52,749 --> 01:12:57,709
and since the last time I touch it.

509
01:13:03,826 --> 01:13:08,786
Only one thing makes
I go on living.

510
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:11,833
What is it?

511
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:19,697
Hatred.

512
01:13:21,742 --> 01:13:24,734
So what you would do if
they were gone?

513
01:13:24,879 --> 01:13:29,839
Then one day you wake up and realize there is no
what is left for you to kill.

514
01:13:39,726 --> 01:13:43,958
No reason for me to go on living.

515
01:13:48,768 --> 01:13:53,728
<i> That's what I know. I will not be able to heart. </ I>

516
01:13:54,774 --> 01:13:58,800
<i> She does not need anymore. It has been taken. Lost. </ I>

517
01:13:59,912 --> 01:14:01,777
Forever.

518
01:14:21,866 --> 01:14:25,893
What do you think?
Too quiet, right?

519
01:14:26,738 --> 01:14:28,933
Clear, cool, and quiet.

520
01:14:29,974 --> 01:14:33,841
I think we should do this immediately.

521
01:14:56,699 --> 01:15:00,658
Not a lot. But I think we can do it.

522
01:15:01,737 --> 01:15:06,696
- If it can be turned on.
- Oh it will live.

523
01:16:03,829 --> 01:16:07,697
You ready? It's time.

524
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:26,872
Blood <i> new. They are nearby. </ I>

525
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,754
<i> And I know they are looking at us. </ i>

526
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:38,887
What happened?

527
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:42,956
Give me time ok.

528
01:16:45,668 --> 01:16:47,659
You can not switch it on?

529
01:16:48,872 --> 01:16:50,930
Come on baby.

530
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,674
Let's fucking garbage.

531
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,912
It would not be alive right?

532
01:17:09,857 --> 01:17:12,655
Come on!

533
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,919
Come on!

534
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:18,790
You see that.

535
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:21,902
Is not it the most beautiful sound you heard?

536
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:23,698
This is our day.

537
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:27,865
Damn it, we need fuel.

538
01:17:28,909 --> 01:17:32,868
Hey, we need gas gasoline.

539
01:17:52,765 --> 01:17:54,858
You ever ride a boat like this before?

540
01:17:54,934 --> 01:17:56,799
No. I always feel scared to go up.

541
01:17:56,902 --> 01:18:01,702
This is your lucky day.
I will tell you a good feeling.

542
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,800
You have a couple of hours, this place will be history.
You can walk along the beach after this.

543
01:18:07,812 --> 01:18:11,646
I hope you have brought a swimsuit.

544
01:18:15,753 --> 01:18:16,879
No!

545
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:20,713
- Jerry.
- No!

546
01:18:22,693 --> 01:18:25,753
Help me.

547
01:18:25,929 --> 01:18:28,693
Save me, stop him.

548
01:18:29,766 --> 01:18:33,725
Help me.

549
01:18:34,872 --> 01:18:36,930
Jerry.

550
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:57,825
Enter into.

551
01:19:23,684 --> 01:19:26,915
It will not last. Not for a long time.

552
01:19:27,687 --> 01:19:29,780
- We're going to die.
- Shut up.

553
01:19:29,889 --> 01:19:31,914
- We have not much time.
- Shut up you.

554
01:19:32,692 --> 01:19:34,853
- We're going to die.
- He say ...

555
01:19:35,695 --> 01:19:38,664
We will not die.

556
01:19:38,765 --> 01:19:43,725
<i> Damn that's right. It's just a matter of time before it penetrated the door. </ I>

557
01:19:44,704 --> 01:19:48,799
<i> then we die. </ I>

558
01:19:48,874 --> 01:19:51,707
Where is he?

559
01:19:52,678 --> 01:19:55,738
There's another way out?

560
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:04,752
Yeah.

561
01:20:04,855 --> 01:20:07,824
How so.

562
01:20:08,926 --> 01:20:12,885
Whoa. The stocky certainly love this all.

563
01:20:25,942 --> 01:20:27,933
We do not have much time.

564
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:41,881
What is the plan? We go out and continue
shooting up out of ammunition?

565
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:43,680
Not

566
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:46,692
You'll be running toward the truck.

567
01:20:46,762 --> 01:20:47,888
How about you?

568
01:20:49,665 --> 01:20:51,633
I'm going to kill this bitch all.

569
01:20:51,734 --> 01:20:54,703
No, they are too many, too strong.

570
01:20:55,703 --> 01:20:57,933
Do not worry about me, beb.

571
01:20:59,807 --> 01:21:02,867
I'm ready to play.

572
01:21:03,678 --> 01:21:06,841
What do you want to do? Save it.

573
01:21:15,656 --> 01:21:17,715
You ready?

574
01:21:23,697 --> 01:21:28,657
Prior to that, if there's anything there,
just want you to know, I'm proud that we meet.

575
01:21:29,936 --> 01:21:34,736
Banjingan.

576
01:21:34,874 --> 01:21:37,843
That's what I love.

577
01:21:38,711 --> 01:21:43,671
I remember the case yesterday.
You're a sweet girl, Alison.

578
01:21:45,885 --> 01:21:48,819
You too.

579
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:52,646
It's not a mistake.

580
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:56,887
But you still banjingan child.

581
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:22,714
- Come on Ricky, towards the truck.
- Ok.

582
01:22:31,728 --> 01:22:33,696
Let's go.

583
01:22:57,752 --> 01:22:58,810
- What thing?
- No!

584
01:23:51,903 --> 01:23:54,701
No one is currently the case with Alison.

585
01:24:20,831 --> 01:24:22,731
Nobody.

586
01:24:36,846 --> 01:24:38,871
- Come on!
- Hunter.

587
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:43,884
Come!

588
01:24:47,655 --> 01:24:49,885
Go, go away.

589
01:24:50,725 --> 01:24:53,626
Ayulah!

590
01:24:55,663 --> 01:24:59,894
I do not remember that I had no more ammunition

591
01:25:01,869 --> 01:25:05,669
Not the sound I expected.

592
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:13,803
Hunter.

593
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:16,774
Alison.

594
01:25:31,764 --> 01:25:35,824
<i> This is just the beginning, asshole. </ I>

595
01:25:38,803 --> 01:25:42,762
<i> When you go to hell, I will find you and ... </ i>

596
01:26:15,905 --> 01:26:18,897
I will teach you to use the thing

597
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:27,706
Alison, do you think this will be?

598
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,916
Yes, Ricky.

599
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:41,693
It will be.

600
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,632
<i> That was the last time I saw Hunter alive. </ i>

601
01:26:45,666 --> 01:26:48,635
<i> Although our future is uncertain,
he saved us by his death. </ i>

602
01:26:52,873 --> 01:26:56,707
<i> And for that, I will always be grateful. </ i>

603
01:26:56,777 --> 01:27:01,737
<i> I just hope he can meet
with what he wants. </ i>

604
01:27:02,849 --> 01:27:04,749
<i> Order </ i>

605
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:21,889
<i> I am always in a state of severe,
severe that you will never recover. </ i>

606
01:27:24,703 --> 01:27:29,663
<i> Now I'm alive, I
do not know if it's a curse. </ i>

607
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:36,870
<i> They will not be able to finish their work.
Not able to destroy me. </ I>

608
01:27:37,915 --> 01:27:42,875
<i> But I know who can.
If you want all this ends ... </ i>

609
01:27:45,657 --> 01:27:48,717
<i> You must do this yourself. </ i>

610
01:27:49,718 --> 01:28:00,718
