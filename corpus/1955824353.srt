1
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,569
Hello.

2
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:55,076
It's okay.
It's okay.

3
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,578
It's okay.

4
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,486
What do you want?

5
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,999
There's no food here.

6
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,177
Stop!

7
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,269
It's just the two of you?

8
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,313
We had a son.

9
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,484
He didn't make it.

10
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,113
I'm sorry.

11
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,707
What you doing this far out
of the quarantine?

12
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,627
We heard it hadn't traveled
this far.

13
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,130
You heard wrong.

14
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,977
I'd like to run some tests.

15
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,061
What for?

16
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,981
It's nothing
to be afraid of.

17
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,454
Infected.

18
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,041
Report to nearest
quarantine zone immediately.

19
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,220
It needs to be treated
as soon as it appears.

20
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,931
It is the only way
to keep it from spreading.

21
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,197
Subject clear.

22
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,701
I need you
to come with me.

23
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,537
I have food and water.

24
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,333
We can't travel
far in the dark.

25
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,584
Just you.

26
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,382
Trust me.
You will see her again.

27
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,719
Please, we only want to help.

28
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,763
You've helped enough.

29
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,473
You won't survive out here.

30
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,142
None of us will.

31
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,937
You stay away from us.

32
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,690
Anna.

33
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,281
Anna.

34
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,899
Anna!

35
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,390
You think you're
any different?

36
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,229
They're trying to survive
just like you.

37
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,615
You want to see
your wife again?

38
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,120
What are you doing to me?

39
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,419
This didn't
have to happen.

40
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,507
You can stop it.

41
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:41,600
Find Dimitri tarkov.
He'll help.

42
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,894
His daughter's name
is Daisy.

43
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,480
But he wanted
to call her Violet.

44
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,526
Let me out of here!

45
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,777
Let me out!

46
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,743
You are the way out.

47
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,892
Are you gonna get him?

48
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,520
It's your turn.

49
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,730
Bullshit, it's yours.

50
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,791
Hey.

51
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,960
Come on, come on.

52
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,171
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

53
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,967
What's wrong?
You have a nightmare?

54
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,971
Me, too.

55
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,848
It's okay. It's okay.

56
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,860
...it's killing
livestock at an alarming rate.

57
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,321
I'm standing just 15 miles
south of Albany,

58
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,199
near a farm that lost
hundreds of cattle overnight,

59
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,242
shortly after the animals
developed sores

60
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,785
along their necks.

61
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,371
This month along,
more than 10,000 similar cases

62
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,332
have been reported
in the U.S.

63
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,960
In Albany, I'm Amber thomson
for krny news.

64
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,046
And over the
vveekend, it looks perfect.

65
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,881
A couple of showers
upstate New York,

66
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,926
otherwise it's just been
sunny, cool, and crisp.

67
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,929
Cleveland 62,
buffalo 61 on Saturday.

68
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,390
Sunday, another day
complete with sunshine.

69
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,975
Temperatures
a little bit warmer,

70
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:51,688
but still running somewhere
about 70 to 75...

71
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,872
These from your plants?

72
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,457
From the compound inside.

73
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,752
I'd like to take
a closer look.

74
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,215
There's nothing
worth looking at.

75
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,217
You have other priorities.

76
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:05,345
It's properties
are almost identical

77
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,889
to the anti-viral
Tyrell released last month.

78
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,019
If you'd be willing
just to have it profiled

79
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,604
to satisfy
my curiosity. Please.

80
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,901
That article you wrote
caused quite a stir

81
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,155
- at the department last week.
- Yeah, I didn't mean to...

82
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:27,576
vve're here to DC the research they
fund, not satisfy your curiosity.

83
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,372
Stay focused on the work
in front of you, all right?

84
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,499
I don't need you
getting sidetracked.

85
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,419
Sorry. Yeah.

86
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,206
Hey there.

87
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,375
I need to submit this
for profile.

88
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,223
Okay. I'll have
the results in a few days.

89
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,433
Thanks.

90
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,987
We really appreciate you guys
watching him so much.

91
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,989
Oh, please. Say no more.
We love him.

92
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,158
And it's really good
practice for us, you know?

93
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,993
- Mm-hmm.
- 0000.

94
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,579
Brad likes babysitting so much
he wants to open

95
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,623
his own little day-care.
Don't lie. Don't lie!

96
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,000
Oh, god no.

97
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,755
- So, how's the research going?
- Mm. Good.

98
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,550
You still, uh, tinkering
with that plant?

99
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,553
Hey, have you ever tried
to smoke it?

100
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,013
- Brad!
- What? It's a valid question.

101
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,849
What?

102
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,144
- It wouldn't do much for ya.
- There ya go.

103
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,438
Well, you never know
until you try.

104
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,400
- Ol-|, mo you tell them?
- Un-uh.

105
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,735
We finally closed the deal
on the montauk house.

106
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,405
Ah, congratulations,
that's great.

107
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,449
Well, it took
long enough to close.

108
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,701
Vve're actually going up this vveekend.
You guys should come.

109
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,411
0l-|,
that's a great idea.

110
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,621
We shouldn't come bother you
before you're all settled.

111
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,582
- Yeah.
- Vvhy? Vvhat good is an empty house?

112
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,292
Seriously. Just pack a bag
and the three of you,

113
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,377
come on up.

114
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,880
What do you think?
We could bring Dylan.

115
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,925
- And he's never seen the ocean.
- Ah, so cute.

116
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,344
This weekend is supposed
to be raining, isn't it?

117
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,055
- Is it?
- Vve'll just light a fire in the fireplace,

118
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,099
maybe grab a few
bottles of wine,

119
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,852
maybe smoke some
of that plant of yours...

120
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,479
Speaking of which,

121
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,315
I have a lot of work
at the lab.

122
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,693
Over the weekend?

123
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,237
It's gonna be the end
of the month, and...

124
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,948
- We're behind.
- Hmm.

125
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,410
But we'll come out soon.
I promise.

126
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,787
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

127
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,748
Listen, the house isn't
going anywhere

128
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,125
- and you two are always welcome, okay?
- Thank you.

129
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,252
- Absolutely.
- And pretty soon

130
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,922
Dylan's gonna have a little
buddy to come svvimming vvith.

131
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,632
Countin' the days.

132
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,008
Already countin' the days.

133
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,426
Me, too.

134
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,802
Shut it.

135
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,668
Hello?

136
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,294
Chris towne?

137
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,672
- Yes.
- My name is Jim eldon.

138
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,924
I work for Tyrell
pharmaceuticals.

139
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,636
<i>Ls there something
I can help you with?</i>

140
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,013
<i>Actually I was
hoping lcoul_l:> Help you.</i>

141
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,100
We noticed the article
you recently published.

142
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,685
I was hoping I could
buy you a drink?

143
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,604
Ask you a couple
of questions?

144
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,691
Uh, I'm sorry.
Lt's... it's late.

145
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,026
And I've got work to do.

146
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,946
They don't understand the
importance 0f your discovery.

147
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,620
- What do you mean by that?
- Meet me for one drink.

148
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,998
I promise you'll be
happy you did.

149
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,062
...the next stop ls Broadway.

150
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,824
It's spreading to humans.

151
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,451
That's why I'm here.

152
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,665
We want you to come
work for us.

153
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:12,796
Why me?

154
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,383
The compound from your plants

155
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,094
is an alternative way
to fight the infection.

156
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,680
It naturally produces
what we've been trying

157
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,807
to chemically
synthesize for years.

158
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,728
University will need
to know about this.

159
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,064
Their involvement
won't be necessary.

160
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,733
The last thing we want
to do is cause a panic.

161
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,652
The more people that know
about this, the better.

162
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,530
If this thing... if this thing
were to get out of control?

163
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,658
Look, my company has spent more
time and money studying this virus

164
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,661
than anybody else
has bothered.

165
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,954
We're the single reason
that this outbreak

166
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,082
has not become
bigger at this point.

167
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,044
With your help...

168
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,922
We work together,
we can stop this thing.

169
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,761
What do you say?

170
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,765
I'll need to think about it.

171
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,893
I didn't realize there'd be
anything to think about.

172
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,815
Look...

173
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,444
I know your salary.

174
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,321
We can pay you
ten times that at Tyrell.

175
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,870
Thanks for the drink.

176
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,413
Where you going?

177
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,376
- Home.
- Oh, that's right...

178
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,920
You've got a family
to think about.

179
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,257
And what's that
supposed to mean?

180
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:43,928
Only that you'd be able to take
better care of them vvorking for us.

181
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,939
Call me when you're ready.

182
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,853
Dmitri tarkov.

183
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,314
Do I know you?

184
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,818
You sent me here.

185
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,157
That's funny.

186
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,702
Who put you up to this, huh?

187
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,787
Anderson.

188
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,540
You tell him
I'm sick of his jokes.

189
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,917
He's a fucking asshole.

190
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,837
Wait, wait. No, he told me
to find you.

191
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,131
- He said you'd be a...
- lt's not funny, man.

192
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,757
- No. No, please.
- Please leave me alone.

193
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,509
- You don't understand.
- Get out of my way.

194
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,469
He doesn't know what
they're going to do with it.

195
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,471
There's going to be
a pandemic

196
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,766
and he's going to give them the compound.
There's a virus, okay?

197
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,685
- Come on. I don't have time for this.
- Look, look,

198
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,437
you have to believe me.
Please, please.

199
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,107
- People are going to die.
- Touch me, I'll call security.

200
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,614
You... you... you have
a daughter.

201
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,450
And her name is Daisy.

202
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,785
But you wanted
to call her Violet.

203
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,892
So, tell me...

204
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,311
Who told you
about my daughter?

205
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,441
You did.

206
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,861
You really expect me
to believe this.

207
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,157
I don't know
what to tell you.

208
00:42:56,365 --> 00:43:00,036
You wrote a book saying
time travel's possible.

209
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,832
It's a theory.
We would never test it.

210
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,751
The amount of energy required,

211
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,003
if one thing went wrong,

212
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:12,423
you create nuclear implosion.
You would never risk it.

213
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,094
You will.

214
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,644
If I had the ability
to go back,

215
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,021
why would I send you?
Why not myself?

216
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,276
- Because I can stop it.
- Oh, stop what?

217
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,989
There's going to be a pandemic.

218
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,536
I have a cure.

219
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,539
But I'm going to give it
to the wrong people.

220
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,291
<i>I see. So I sent you back</i>

221
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,128
to help you stop yourself,
hmm?

222
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,132
No, no, no.

223
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,217
You can already see
the first signs.

224
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,137
You're gonna start noticing people
vvith a rash on their neck.

225
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,264
And there's
a very short window...

226
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,308
I don't have time for this.
I have to pick up my daughter.

227
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,521
She will die.

228
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,068
You're sick.
You need help.

229
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,757
<i>Reports are comma m from China</i>

230
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,595
that an unknovvn virus has infected thousands
of people in the city of Shanghai.

231
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,264
Doctors are still unsure
as to the origin of the virus

232
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,142
that begins when victims
develop a rash along their neck.

233
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,852
Now, the ambulance team

234
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,689
are taking as many
precautions as they can.

235
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,942
They're getting into
these white plastic suits,

236
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,485
the hoods up.

237
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,744
...vvorld health organization
is holding an emergency meeting.

238
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,872
It could declare
a global health emergency,

239
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,292
imposing travel bans
and border controls all...

240
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,471
hey... yo.

241
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,350
Got those results back.

242
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,060
Thanks.

243
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,580
We treated human cells
infected with a pathogen.

244
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,875
The compound reduced
cell death by 20%.

245
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,421
You show this
to anyone else?

246
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,798
Not yet.

247
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,595
I'll have them moved to the chamber
so we can better monitor them.

248
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,806
And, uh, I can start
growing more.

249
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,850
Oh, that won't be necessary.

250
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:14,647
I'll need more time to verify the results
before jumping to any conclusions, so...

251
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,317
This is my research.

252
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,112
Not anymore.

253
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,909
You can't do this.

254
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,161
I'll go to the chair
of the department.

255
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,125
He'll vvant tc knovv hovv you got these
through testing vvithout my approval.

256
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,128
Forgery's a serious offense,
Chris.

257
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,214
I had to prove to you. You didn't
even believe me that the compound...

258
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,258
you haven't proved anything.

259
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,051
If anyone found out
about this,

260
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,928
you'd lose your job.

261
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,347
I'm doing you a favor.

262
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,059
I'll take over from here.

263
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,770
If I need your help,
I'll ask for it.

264
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,372
We'll give you your own lab.

265
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:18,044
Entire staff. Everything you
need to continue your research.

266
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,756
The team is so excited to see vvhat
you're going to be able to do.

267
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,051
I'd like to get started
as soon as possible.

268
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:29,847
Just a few details we need
to get straightened out first.

269
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,933
Your plans for the compound?

270
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,061
I'd like you to move those
to our lab.

271
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,774
I can't do that.
The university owns them.

272
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,736
I don't care about the university.
It's yqur vvork.

273
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,029
You don't need to ask them.

274
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,658
You want me to steal them.

275
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:54,455
You're the one that's being
robbed 0f your own discovery.

276
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,374
And you know the codes
to their lab.

277
00:47:56,582 --> 00:48:00,211
You can go in anytime.
I don't understand the problem.

278
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,132
I'm just asking for you to take
what's already yours.

279
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:09,345
It's not worth the risk.
I can replicate them for you.

280
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,269
Your job, Chris, at Tyrell
depends entirely

281
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,190
on our exclusive access
to the research and those plans.

282
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:26,153
Anything other than that,
this deal is over.

283
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:30,699
L... I'm just trying to help you
get credit for your own work.

284
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,285
All these years,
your discovery.

285
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,080
But the only way I can help you
is if you help us.

286
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,090
Pow.

287
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,431
He loves his paper crane.

288
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,144
<i>Susan was saying that he
started to say l-lls first word today.</i>

289
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,856
He said "bird."

290
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,867
Oh.

291
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,911
This cures it?

292
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,038
If it's treated
early enough.

293
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,042
So why wasn't it stopped?

294
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,546
Money.

295
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,967
The more it spread,

296
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,969
the more valuable
the compound became.

297
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,183
They never had any intention
of stopping it.

298
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,252
What is that?

299
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,337
A warning.

300
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,617
Are you okay? What ls it?

301
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,243
Tell me, what is it?
Tell me!

302
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,828
What's wrong?

303
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,913
Your leg.

304
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:59,319
Oh, sorry. I vvas trying to find
light svvitch for corner hall.

305
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,449
Who are you?

306
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,577
Uh, my name is Ivan.

307
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:11,206
I'm sent here to, uh,
to clean floors.

308
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:16,003
They tell me no one is allowed
here at this hour.

309
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,629
I was just leaving.

310
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,715
Not... not that way.

311
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,677
Uh, you'll slip.

312
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,431
Please, this way.

313
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,996
How's your leg?

314
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,584
That was causing the pain.

315
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,257
It was tracking you.

316
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,383
What for?

317
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,927
To follow you.

318
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:50,138
That's why I disconnected it.

319
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,438
There's something I would
like you to look at.

320
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,908
It's okay, Daisy.

321
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,161
It's okay.

322
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,247
Let him see.

323
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:01,501
Darling, I think you'll have
to stay home from school today.

324
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,379
It's Mary Anne's birthday
today.

325
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,008
She'll be fine.

326
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,001
Where's her mom?

327
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:29,297
She's gone.

328
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,383
Cancer.

329
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,763
I'm sorry.

330
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:40,225
That's how all of this
got started.

331
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:44,187
Trying to find a way
back to her.

332
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,273
My wife...

333
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,776
She's here.

334
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,282
It is not your wife.

335
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,910
You must stay away
from her.

336
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,788
How can you expect me
to do that?

337
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:17,721
By coming back here,
you've changed everything.

338
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,809
There is no way for you
to know what happens next.

339
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:27,355
If you want to protect her,

340
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,608
you will stay away.

341
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,588
No, please.

342
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:34,798
No!

343
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,091
No, no, no, no!

344
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,201
It's okay.
We made it.

345
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,453
We made it.

346
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:34,149
He's dead.

347
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,944
And you're still alive.

348
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,197
Thanks to you.

349
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,074
How is that possible?

350
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:51,708
The second you interacted
with him,

351
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,252
you changed his course.

352
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,546
You created a new past.

353
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,760
You separated us...
From them.

354
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,973
I'm not supposed to be here.

355
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:12,395
We are survivors.

356
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,689
We have earned the right
to be here.

357
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,548
You grab his feet.

358
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,640
Do you want her
to see him like this?

359
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,770
Here, take this.

360
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,691
You will need it.

361
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,405
Where are you going?

362
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,532
To see my daughter.

363
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,620
You want to see them again,
don't you?

364
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,706
Your family?

365
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,755
You don't have
to lose them again.

366
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,632
This is your life.

367
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,889
All you have to do...

368
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,016
Is take it.

369
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,980
Your son?

370
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,194
He's beautiful.

371
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,785
You didn't show up
last night.

372
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,829
I had people waiting
for you.

373
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,706
Something's not right.

374
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,167
What do you mean,
"something's not right"?

375
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,253
There was someone
at the lab.

376
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,338
At 2:00 in the morning?

377
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,014
You have to try again.

378
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:20,685
I'm sorry, I ca...
i can't be involved in this.

379
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:25,482
You don't have a choice, Chris.
You already are.

380
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,653
Find someone else.

381
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,907
It's too late.
We already released it.

382
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,578
Released what?

383
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,872
If you don't want to do it,
i will.

384
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,457
Just give me the codes
to the lab.

385
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:43,708
Next time I see you,
this will all be taken care of.

386
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,377
If I see you again...

387
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:48,463
I'll call the police.

388
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,510
Beautiful boy.

389
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,065
You look nice.

390
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,197
Where's Dylan?

391
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:42,035
With Susan.

392
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,579
Is everything all right?

393
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,831
Everything's fine.

394
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:01,596
- Vvhat's vvrong?
- Honey, I need you to come vvith me.

395
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,598
I want to go home
to Dylan.

396
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,517
He's going to get it
from you.

397
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,936
You're scaring me.

398
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,231
You don't have to be scared.

399
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,651
I need you to trust me.

400
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:31,788
Hello?
- Susan, hi. Uh, it's Chris.

401
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:36,125
Um, listen, something came up
at work and, uh,

402
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,085
I hate to ask this
of you again,

403
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,839
but is there any way you could
come and watch Dylan for me?

404
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,838
You're gonna be okay.

405
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:32,640
Ha.
Am I, uh, interrupting?

406
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,730
We watched you come in
on the security cameras.

407
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:43,025
We, uh, wanted to see
how far you'd go.

408
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,075
This must be your wife.

409
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:55,538
You didn't tell me
how pretty she was.

410
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,415
What are you doing here?

411
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,208
What you were supposed to.

412
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,335
| can't let you take them.

413
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,628
What are you doing?

414
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:06,048
This isn't his fault.

415
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,885
You said find someone else,
we did.

416
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,934
They're using a compound
to save people.

417
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,562
From a virus they created.

418
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,711
Supply and demand.

419
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,131
Tyrell controls both.

420
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,050
What's he talking about?

421
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:55,264
What are you gonna do?

422
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:58,059
Now that he knows
the truth.

423
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,437
You'll have to shoot us both.

424
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:04,482
No, Chris,
I'm not aiming at you.

425
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,364
You have three seconds
to drop the gun

426
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,407
or I shoot your wife.

427
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:19,330
One.

428
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:23,960
Two.

429
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,544
- Chris...
- stop!

430
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:26,629
Stop.

431
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:14,427
Anna?

432
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,645
Don't look at me.

433
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,776
Close your eyes.

434
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,656
Please, don't.

435
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,158
Close your eyes!

436
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,835
Take care of them.
