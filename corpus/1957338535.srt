00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,200
Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Maher.

2
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,500
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,600
How are you doing?

4
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Thank you, everybody.

5
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:05,800
Thank you.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,767
Wow.

7
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,500
Thank you so much.

8
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,734
Thank you very much.
Oh, boy.

9
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,000
Please, folks...

10
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,367
Thank you very much.

11
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:27,400
Thank you.
That is a wonderful
reception.

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,833
I appreciate that.
It is great to be back
in New York.

13
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,966
Great to be back on Broadway.

14
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,500
The show you're about to see tonight

15
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,367
is one I did for a little while
here on Broadway in the spring,

16
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,966
and the idea behind that show
was embodied

17
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,467
in that first poster that you see...

18
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,734
"Victory begins at home."

19
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,767
The idea that when you're in a war,

20
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,700
the home front,
us, the citizens,
can make a difference.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,767
We can count.

22
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:50,200
The government used to believe that.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,367
They used to tell you that.

24
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,066
They used to make posters like that.

25
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:55,167
But they don't do it anymore.

26
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,300
So I thought I'd make a few.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Now, of course,
my posters might be
a little different

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,133
than what the government
would tell you.

29
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,000
But then the government
tells you things like

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,433
drugs fund terrorism.

31
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:12,033
'Cause what better way
to get the heat off
the oil companies?

32
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,033
You can always... yeah, you know...

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,267
You can always blame anything on drugs.

34
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,300
There's an anti-marijuana
commercial running.

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Have you seen this ad?
Where two 12-year-old boys
are left home alone

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,667
and they start smoking pot

37
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,767
and then one of them finds Dad's gun

38
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:36,100
and shoots the other accidentally

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,233
because they're high.

40
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,467
Only in America
is the villain in this scene

41
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,800
not the guns
or the shitty parenting,
but the pot.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,233
It's... it's always the pot.

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,167
Drugs fund terrorism.
Come on.

44
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:00,833
Terrorists get their money
from the same place everybody
gets their money...

45
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,133
From their relatives.

46
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,333
And their relatives sell oil.

47
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,966
And therein is the problem.

48
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,167
They have the oil,

49
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:13,933
we have the Ford fuck-you-mobiles.

50
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,400
Which I'm not here to speak ag...

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,767
Look, I am not the car police.

52
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,200
I don't want to be the car police.

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,033
I understand Americans love their cars.

54
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,267
I don't get it, but I know
Americans love cars

55
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:25,433
and would hump them if they could.

56
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,734
But does anybody really need a Hummer

57
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,734
in city traffic?

58
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:35,133
You know? I mean...

59
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:40,634
I mean, what... what is next?

60
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:44,133
"Honey, let's take a tank
to the PTA meeting tonight."

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,133
You know, Arabs
are in the oil business.

62
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,866
Same as Texans, you know?

63
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,433
That's... no, that... that is not...

64
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,267
No, no, no, that is...

65
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,600
That is not to equate our government.

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,333
It's just to say that a political party

67
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,500
that gets a lot
of its campaign contributions
from oil companies

68
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,866
is not going to make this connection.

69
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,000
And neither are the Democrats

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,100
who like the money they get
from automobile unions.

71
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,500
So the two parties
are gonna do the only thing
they ever really do well

72
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,000
on a bipartisan level...

73
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,233
They're going to change the subject.

74
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,433
Ladies and gentlemen,
on September 11th, 2001,

75
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,200
America was attacked
by a squad of Saudi Arabians

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,534
working out of Germany,
Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

77
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,767
And by that I mean
we were attacked by Iraq.

78
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,133
What the...

79
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,967
What?

80
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,267
Yes, the true axis of evil in America

81
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,133
is the genius of our marketing

82
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,100
combined with the stupidity
of our people.

83
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:58,734
The... the way they were able
to morph bin Laden into Hussein

84
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:00,333
was just too easy, wasn't it?

85
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,700
I mean, I'm glad Hussein is gone,

86
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,066
but the Joker is not the Riddler,

87
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,567
and...

88
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,033
on this particular crime,

89
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,767
there was no blood in his Bronco.

90
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:14,333
The...

91
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,033
Do you know that the...

92
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,200
You know that
the governor of this state

93
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,233
suggested that we melt down
the toppled statues

94
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,333
of Saddam Hussein from Baghdad

95
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,367
and use them
in a new World Trade Center

96
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,667
so that we could send
a message to the world

97
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:33,567
that we are a people
who cannot tell Arabs apart.

98
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,300
Which all seems especially hypocritical

99
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,800
when you think about... the first thing

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,333
the administration told us
after the attacks

101
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:52,667
was no lumping
the terrorists in
with the whole Muslim world.

102
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:55,133
These are terrorists
who happened to be Muslim,

103
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,167
but don't enflame them all by lumping.

104
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,433
But then when they
can't find bin Laden,

105
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:02,634
"Lump!

106
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:05,367
Who said no lumping?
We love lumping!

107
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,734
We're lumping people!"

108
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:11,433
It must've been
so frustrating for them,
you know?

109
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,267
After all that tough talk about,

110
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,200
"We're gonna get 'em
dead or alive."

111
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,667
Which at some point became,
"Well, he's either dead
or alive.

112
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:20,700
You know, that's what we meant.

113
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,500
It's"...

114
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,200
"It's not about one man."

115
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,934
But it is,
and people wanna know,
where's Waldo?

116
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,433
And now we can't find Hussein,

117
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,383
the guy we went after
because we couldn't
find bin Laden.

118
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,200
And now...
and now they're both
making tapes.

119
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,467
It's like...

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,500
I guess what we're trying
to do is get them into some
sort of rappers' war

121
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,767
where they're
dissing each other
on each other's records,

122
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,833
and hopefully they'll pop
a cap in each other's ass

123
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:02,800
or s... I don't...

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,534
But, look, if you were against this war

125
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:07,133
or you don't
like the president,
you have to root for the plan

126
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,667
because this may have been Bush's war,

127
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,767
but it's America's peace now.

128
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,900
And you have to root
for the plan to succeed.

129
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,367
The plan, as I understand it,

130
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,966
being the total humiliation
and liquidation of Iraq,

131
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:22,100
followed by her rebuilding
from scratch in our image.

132
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,467
Otherwise known as Scientology.

133
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:33,500
It is amazing to me
what lies people care
most about.

134
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,667
It blows my mind that the one lie

135
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,966
that they still can't get over
is Monica Lewinsky.

136
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,066
That... that one
is the standard of mendacity

137
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,734
that ever came out of the White House.

138
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:44,100
When I think about the lies...

139
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,133
The huge, steaming-turd whoppers

140
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,800
that I've heard that have
affected all of our lives

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,333
just in my lifetime...
"JFK shot by a lone gunman."

142
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:57,066
"We're winning the war
in Vietnam."

143
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,333
"We didn't trade arms
for hostages."

144
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:03,767
"Global warming
needs more study."

145
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:07,767
"Clarence Thomas
is the most qualified person
we can find."

146
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,734
But the one they can't get over is...

147
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:17,700
"I did not get my dick sucked
by that woman."

148
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm so...

149
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:28,866
"My hand was not on the titty
when she was on the knob

150
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,833
and that technically was not... "

151
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,100
This is what people obsess about?

152
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,400
It just backs up my case that
this is a feminized country

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,467
because obviously
the worst thing anyone
can ever do in America

154
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,667
is get a blowjob.

155
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:47,700
But lying about a war?
Eh, so what?

156
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,133
And, you know, look.
There is no doubt

157
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,567
that this is a war
that started under
false premises

158
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,800
because this is a war
that originally was sold to us

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,133
as one we had to fight
for our own self-preservation,
right?

160
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,367
Because there was
this meteor named Iraq

161
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,966
heading right for us,

162
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,267
and that if we did not
get rid of Saddam Hussein,

163
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,167
the moon would crash into the Earth

164
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,767
and eagles would eat your cock.

165
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,567
But when nobody bought that bullshit,

166
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,933
Bush started to end every speech with,

167
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:22,966
"And did I mention the torture?

168
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,933
The torture!
He gassed his own people!"

169
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:30,500
Uh, yeah, when your dad was president.

170
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,433
And he was so upset about it,
he almost interrupted
his golf game.

171
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,033
I mean, talk...

172
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,000
Talk about a delayed reaction.

173
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
Even the Kurds are like,
"Come on, it was the '80s."

174
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,967
"People were experimenting.
It was a crazy time."

175
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:02,333
I mean, this is why
we never really had
a coalition, you know.

176
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,800
We had England because Tony Blair

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,300
is George Bush's prison bitch.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,700
And... and we had 200 Australians

179
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
and a Polish Jeep driver named Lars.

180
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,833
That...

181
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:21,100
And by the way,
on that subject, if I could
say one thing.

182
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,333
If I could give the president
just one bit of advice,

183
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,467
it's not a critique,
but, Mr. President,

184
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,500
when you have those joint
press conferences,

185
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,533
let Tony Blair
do the talking, you know?

186
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,100
Come on,
Mr. President.

187
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,567
You're too big for that.
You're the star of this thing.

188
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:45,267
You're Clint Eastwood.

189
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:49,066
Let the gay English character actor...

190
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,634
lay the pipe.

191
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,500
No, war is a lot easier than peace.

192
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,333
There's a lot of bright guys
in that administration,

193
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,000
but they forgot about that.

194
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,734
But it is too late
for the Democrats
to be crying foul

195
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:03,433
about this weapons
of mass destruction stuff.

196
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,667
They knew that was hyped bullshit

197
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,900
when they voted for it in October.

198
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,233
Now, should the President
of the United States

199
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,800
be a little bit more careful
about the intelligence he gets

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
and perhaps not trust Austin Powers?

201
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,033
Yes.

202
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,467
Does the average American

203
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:30,500
have more dangerous chemicals
in his garage?

204
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,066
Yes, apparently.

205
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:35,500
But, you know,
they still might find
weapons of mass destruction.

206
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,000
And if they don't,
I have it on good authority

207
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,634
that the Los Angeles
Police Department
will plant them.

208
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:42,333
But...

209
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:47,033
But, you know...

210
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:51,066
At the end of the day
to this administration
it doesn't matter,

211
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,833
because half the geniuses
in this country

212
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:57,233
think that we already
found weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq

213
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:01,100
and the other half
think that George Bush
is a fighter pilot.

214
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,100
That is an administration
that does understand pictures

215
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,833
because, you know,
once they got that picture
of him in the flight suit,

216
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:11,100
that was all they...
that was what the whole war
was about.

217
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,433
"Hello, look at me,
I'm in a flight suit.

218
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,966
My cock looks huge.

219
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,667
I'm on an aircraft carrier.

220
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,767
There's... big cock, flight suit, me,

221
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,667
military guys, flag.

222
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,367
Hello.
Why even have an election?"

223
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,734
No, he understands
a picture is worth everything.

224
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:39,933
I mean, this is a president
with no environmental policy,

225
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,167
but he knows enough
to, every six months,

226
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,700
do a photo op in front of a giant tree.

227
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,233
Every six months,
he just stands in front
of a big sequoia

228
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,600
with that smirk on his face like,

229
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,400
"Am I hurtin' that tree?

230
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,534
Am I pissin'
on that tree?
No.

231
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:59,400
I love that tree.
Tree, me, people.
Do the math."

232
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,200
And that is the environmental policy.

233
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,233
"There's a black kid sittin' on my lap.

234
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,367
I'm readin' to a black kid.
He's sittin' right on me.

235
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,400
Am I freakin' out?
No."

236
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:30,400
"Am I like,
'Get that tar baby
off of me?' No!"

237
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,966
And that's the race policy.

238
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,167
I mean, it's just astounding
how they work.

239
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,866
I mean, the 2000 convention
that the Republicans had?

240
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,600
Oh, my God.
The last time the Republicans

241
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,033
had that many black people on a stage,

242
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,400
they were selling them.

243
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,900
I mean...

244
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,367
Hey, folks, come on.

245
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,333
The entertainment
the first night of
the convention

246
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,966
was Chaka Khan.

247
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,033
This is the party running on integrity

248
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:02,700
'cause, you know,
when you get a bunch
of 60-ish red state

249
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,400
white people in a room
voting on entertainment...

250
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,433
Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan,
Chaka, Chaka, Chaka, Chaka...
it's all Chaka Khan.

251
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,966
It's, you know,
a couple of votes
for the Gatlin Brothers,

252
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,100
you know.

253
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,734
A few for the Dixie Chicks

254
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:20,367
before they joined Al-Qaeda, this is.

255
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:23,033
That's before.

256
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,233
Oh, it's such a shame
when our country singers

257
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:29,700
become Islamic fundamentalists.

258
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,667
Isn't that a...
I don't know why
that keeps happening.

259
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,966
The best photo op ever...

260
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,634
George Bush
about a year ago
at Mount Rushmore.

261
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,700
They set up the podium
at the base of the mountain

262
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,300
so that his head was exactly in line

263
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,667
and in proportion to the heads
on the mountain,

264
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,167
which I thought
was a pretty sleazy trick.

265
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,966
And I don't think
I'm the only one
who thought that

266
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,333
'cause I swear to God,
for about half a second,

267
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,233
I thought I saw Lincoln go...

268
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,500
And usually when they have a photo op,

269
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,033
they usually have a three-word slogan.

270
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,700
Because that is
our attention span,
three words, you know?

271
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,333
"Restoring
America's Future."

272
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,966
"Testing
America's Gullibility."

273
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,300
'Cause they know
you control the debate
by controlling the word.

274
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,767
You just gotta control the word.

275
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,500
You just gotta make
the politician say the word

276
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
that the hamsters in the focus group

277
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,600
make hit the pedal.

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,033
Say the word that makes
the hamsters hit the pedal.

279
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,400
"Values."

280
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,467
You don't have to mean it,
just say "values."

281
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,700
"Values, yes, values.
We... we like values.

282
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,567
Values are...
he said values.
We like that.

283
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:49,066
He has values."

284
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,734
They're, uh...

285
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,634
We used to have a tax
in this country called
the estate tax,

286
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,200
which was very popular
because it's a tax

287
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,634
on very, very, very rich fucks who die.

288
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,800
And people thought,
"That's a good person to tax,"

289
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,400
and that is a good person to tax

290
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,933
because rich fucks who die
should give away their money

291
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:21,000
or else they give it
to their ne'er-do-well kid
who becomes Uday Hussein.

292
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,833
But the Republicans changed the name

293
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,966
from the estate tax to the death tax.

294
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,833
And people went, "Death?
That could happen to me.

295
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,867
I'm not hittin' the pedal
on that one."

296
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
The Republicans
are so much better
at that word game.

297
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,767
Like, they're always
from the heartland.

298
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,367
Heartland?
Come on.

299
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:51,233
Dick Cheney
from the heartland,
ironically.

300
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,000
Uh...

301
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,333
I remember when they made
the announcement

302
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,667
that Dick Cheney was going to be
the vice president candidate.

303
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:05,000
They purposefully went back
to the heartland home of his,

304
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,167
back to Casper, Wyoming,

305
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:10,633
the only town whiter
than the ghost itself.

306
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,600
And they went back
to Dick Cheney's high school,

307
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,300
where he'd been the captain
of the football team,

308
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,133
and, folks, this
was when I knew I would
never be mainstream.

309
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,200
Because obviously
this shit works on people,

310
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,534
but, I mean, I would never
go back to my high school.

311
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:30,000
I hated my high school.

312
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,966
I hated the captain
of the football team.

313
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:37,433
I wish we had school shootings
when I was in high school.

314
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,833
These lucky kids today.

315
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,467
I would've loved
to have picked up a gun

316
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,467
and shot a bunch of kids
in my high school,

317
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,800
these spoiled bastards.

318
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,866
Anyway, there's Dick Cheney
back at his high school,

319
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,100
captain of the football team,

320
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
and then the pièce de résistance,

321
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,233
they bring out his wife,

322
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,433
who of course had been
his high school sweetheart.

323
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:02,634
And, again, this so doesn't work on me.

324
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,800
That you married
the first chick to give you
a hand job.

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,900
You know, that's... thank you.

326
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,467
Oh, I kid Dick Cheney,
but he has a plan

327
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,133
to save the government money.

328
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,233
It involves
moving the White House
to the Cayman Islands.

329
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,367
How's that for wartime loyalty, huh?

330
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:32,066
These Fortune 500 companies
who move offshore.

331
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,600
Of course, they don't
really move offshore.

332
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,900
That's the scam.

333
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,500
Enron isn't
really headquartered
in the Bahamas.

334
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,534
It's a phone and a monkey.

335
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,767
And a mailbox to collect
their dirty, bloody money.

336
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:46,500
Plus, how stupid
are these companies,
you know?

337
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,900
The money gets to live
in the Caribbean.

338
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,900
They stay in Newark.
What?

339
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,467
It's so easy to say anything.

340
00:18:55,667 --> 00:19:00,000
The one that's easy to say now
is, "I support the troops."

341
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,933
It doesn't cost you anything.
"I support the troops."

342
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,634
But I got a question for you.

343
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,700
Can you really support the troops

344
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,866
if you also support
these massive tax cuts
for the very rich?

345
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,066
'Cause, you know,
the people we say
are our heroes

346
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:16,333
are paid by tax dollars.

347
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:20,767
And we hear about teachers...
have to buy their own
school supplies.

348
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:24,066
Soldiers in this country
are on food stamps.

349
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:27,866
Firemen... well, firemen
get laid so easily, though.
Fuck them.

350
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,834
But anyway...

351
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,200
But, I mean, couldn't
somebody in Congress
stand up and say,

352
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,167
"Why don't we take
half of that big tax cut

353
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,300
and give it
to our heroes?"

354
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,367
Or is that why they're our heroes?

355
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:41,967
'Cause they work cheap?

356
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
It's okay.

357
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:54,300
Applause costs you nothing.

358
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,433
But think about that
next time you see George Bush

359
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,033
hugging a bunch of military guys.

360
00:19:58,233 --> 00:19:59,933
And, look, I'm not gonna
rag on Bush all night.

361
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:04,033
Look, I will tell you this.
I will give George Bush
credit for this.

362
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:07,567
He is working a lot harder
than he thought he'd have to.

363
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,533
You know, there...

364
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:16,667
I tell ya,
no more homeschooling
for that boy.

365
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,600
He is going to class.

366
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,667
But spare me this nonsense
I have heard so often

367
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,767
about how, "Oh, we dodged a bullet

368
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,467
when Bush pulled off
the election and then
9/11 happened

369
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,767
because, you know,
if Al Gore had been
president..."

370
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:33,367
What, we'd be reading
the Quran now, is that it?

371
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,100
Like George Bush is the only one

372
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,567
who could've pointed
to Afghanistan on a map
and said, "Destroy that"?

373
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:44,367
I'm sorry, George Bush
pointing out a country
on a map?

374
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,734
Oh, I didn't know what I was thinking.

375
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:55,667
No, no.
Rumsfeld does the pointing.

376
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,966
See, I love him, Rumsfeld,

377
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,267
'cause he's so politically incorrect.

378
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,467
How could I not love him?

379
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,800
And what I love about him also

380
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,767
is that he makes no effort
to ever be reassuring.

381
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,400
You notice that?
He says things like,

382
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,667
"I don't think they could get
a nuclear bomb in there,

383
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,767
but, yeah, maybe."

384
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:19,100
What the hell is that?

385
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:25,700
Oh, and people say
he's Neanderthal and crude
and macho... you know what?

386
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,467
If we're gonna let
just one guy in America
not have to be a pussy,

387
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,634
I say it's the Secretary of Defense.

388
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,800
How about that?

389
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:43,800
However,
the Rumsfelds of the world,
they do need to be watched.

390
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,900
So do the Ashcrofts
and the Bushes and a lot
of other people,

391
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,200
and I think where
the citizens of this country...

392
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,933
Where we let ourselves down...

393
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,400
Is that after the attacks,

394
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,800
just when we should've
been paying more attention,

395
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,800
I think we paid less attention.

396
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,500
Because thinking
about icky things like war
and terrorism...

397
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,033
would cause stress.

398
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,967
And then they'd win.

399
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,000
And the president fed right into that.

400
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,433
He did not lead on this.

401
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,900
He had about...
a window of opportunity
of about two months

402
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,500
where he could've
asked us to do anything,
and what did he say?

403
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,800
"Keep shopping.
Spend money.

404
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,567
Take your wife to dinner.
Go see 'Cats' again.

405
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,500
Shop till they drop,
girlfriend."

406
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,333
Which is not to say
that we wouldn't
have done more,

407
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:37,734
'cause I think we would.

408
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:40,200
We are an industrious people.

409
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,933
But, you know, we're also a people...

410
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:45,133
If we can get out of work, we do.

411
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,433
This was brought home to me
about a year ago

412
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,033
when there was breaking news
from rural Georgia.

413
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:54,133
Do you remember this story?
They found all these bodies

414
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,734
behind this crematorium in Georgia.

415
00:22:56,934 --> 00:23:01,467
And when I first heard of it,
I thought, "Ooh, this is some
sort of nefarious cult."

416
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:02,966
No, just lazy.

417
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,600
Just...

418
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,967
Just letting work pile up,
as many of us do.

419
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,600
It was like the "I Love Lucy" episode

420
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,200
with the chocolates coming
down the conveyor belt,
you know?

421
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,900
The guy just couldn't
keep up with the volume.

422
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,400
Plus, you're talking
about rural Georgia,

423
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,333
so it was confusing
'cause a guy would come in
asking for his wife

424
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,800
and his sister,
"Is that one body or two?"

425
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,133
You know, that...

426
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,734
Okay.

427
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:39,100
Many... a lot of people
from rural Georgia here
on Broadway?

428
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,167
That happens on Broadway.

429
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:42,667
Sorry.

430
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,933
Sorry to offend you.

431
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,500
I was just trying to make the point

432
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,133
that families are allowed
to be different.

433
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,534
Well, we were told that after 9/11.

434
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:55,966
That's what the government said,

435
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,833
you know, that this was not
a clash of civilizations.

436
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:01,734
Osama bin Laden, for example...
Do you know this?

437
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:06,667
Is the 17th of 55 children.

438
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:09,866
It's always the middle 20
that give you the problems.

439
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,533
Is that right?

440
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,966
But... this is not
a clash of civilizations?

441
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:21,233
Yeah, we have
two, three kids,
you have 55.

442
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:24,267
We like to have our women
in the workplace,

443
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:28,133
you keep yours in beekeeper suits.

444
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:34,700
What is up with the beekeeper suits?

445
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,734
I mean, can you imagine
if some white country

446
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,667
kept its black people
in beekeeper suits?

447
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:43,300
There'd be a riot at the UN.

448
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,667
Jesse Jackson's head would explode.

449
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:49,400
Al Sharpton would call
a press conference.

450
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:02,200
How do you get away...
How does a country get away

451
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,300
with keeping
half its population
in beekeeper suits?

452
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,133
I'll tell you how.
They say the magic word...
"religion."

453
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,433
It's their religion.
You say "religion,"

454
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:15,866
you can get away with anything.

455
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,900
The Catholics
got away with fucking kids,

456
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,167
for crying out loud!

457
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,300
Oh, you're right.
I made that up.

458
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,367
I'm sorry, you're right.

459
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,600
I pulled that right outta my ass.

460
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,133
That has not been in the paper a lot.

461
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,700
Excuse me, they had
to have a conference

462
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,367
to decide if they should
continue to fuck kids.

463
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:37,966
They did.
A guy made a speech.

464
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,734
He said, "Look, we've had
a good long run...

465
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:47,033
but, uh, it's become
something of a meat market
around here.

466
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:50,567
Put a little more lotion
on Father Tom, Billy."

467
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,333
I mean, come on.

468
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,534
But, look, all you need to know

469
00:25:56,734 --> 00:26:00,033
about the fact that this is
a clash of civilizations

470
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,300
is the beekeeper suit, that burka.

471
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,933
The fact... the way we treat
our women so differently.

472
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,667
I mean, in our society,

473
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:10,400
we try to get women to undress
as much as possible.

474
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,233
We like to be teased.

475
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:15,700
Whereas their view is,
"If I can't have the pussy,
I don't want to see it.

476
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,600
Okay, just... that is too painful.

477
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Just throw a tarp on that because I...

478
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,467
I'll be thinking
about that all day."

479
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,300
You know, whereas in this country,

480
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,467
women wear these jeans that are cut...

481
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,133
That had to be
the last straw
for bin Laden.

482
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:38,100
When those jeans...
that was like, "You pushed
my buttons on... "

483
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,734
Because, you know,
it's like a woman
walks into a place

484
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,367
and just like,
"Hi, you don't even
know my name,

485
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,267
you're one inch from pussy.

486
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,267
What do you think about that?

487
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:51,333
Haven't even met me,
you are one inch from pussy.

488
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,167
We haven't said hello."

489
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:58,800
You're on the one-yard line,
the game has not begun.

490
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,300
It's amazing.

491
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:06,233
But I tell... you know
who I feel sorry for
in America

492
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,867
is whores.

493
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:14,266
Because what can a whore
wear anymore that...

494
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
You know...

495
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
What can a whore wear

496
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,066
to signal the prospective customer,

497
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:31,800
"No, I'm a real whore.
I'm selling this ass.

498
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,833
I'm not on my way
to an award show,
I'm a whore.

499
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,100
A real whore."

500
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,066
But, you know, we're all whores.

501
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:44,667
You do know that, right?

502
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:49,233
That's what Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson said
after 9/11.

503
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:52,667
They said, "God let it happen
because we're wicked,

504
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:56,467
because we're abortionists
and homosexuals and adulterers,

505
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,200
so God let it happen."

506
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,467
Which I don't agree with,
but it cleared something
up for me

507
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:01,800
because I've always wondered, right?

508
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,467
"What's the nature of God?"

509
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,300
And now I know.
He's a prick.

510
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,367
Oh, he let it happen.
A prick, wow.

511
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:13,200
Interesting.

512
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,200
I had heard good things,
but apparently not.

513
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Are there any Christian
fundamentalists here tonight?

514
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,734
No? Because, you know,
I have been defending

515
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,367
the Christian fundamentalists
because it really bothers me

516
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:29,900
when people compare
their fundamentalists
with ours.

517
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,200
I hear it all the time.
"You know, we have
extremists, too."

518
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,667
Uh, yeah, but this is
a great country because ours
are just funny.

519
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:45,367
The worst ours can do is,
like, you know, identify
the gay Teletubby.

520
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:49,433
That's like... it's purple!
It's purple!

521
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:52,567
You're... purple, gay, hello!

522
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,767
Your kids are seeing a gay...

523
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,667
You know, whereas in Saudi Arabia...

524
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:02,367
You know, our ally.

525
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,634
In Saudi Arabia, on Friday nights,

526
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:11,433
they have beheadings for
such crimes as homosexuality

527
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:16,667
or adultery or being
an infidel or not rewinding
or whatever.

528
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,933
So, yes, Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson

529
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,033
are morons who think
homosexuals are going
to burn in hell,

530
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:24,833
but they're not suggesting
that we go over

531
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:29,133
to Richard Simmons' house
and cut off his head.

532
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,033
I'm suggesting it.

533
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,934
In fact,
I'm insisting on it.
No.

534
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:42,700
No, I think
Western civilization
is more enlightened

535
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,333
precisely because we have learned

536
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,734
how to ignore our religious leaders.

537
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:51,500
You know?
Every religious leader
says things.

538
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,600
You know, when one of their
ayatollahs issues a falafel,

539
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,734
they do it.

540
00:29:58,433 --> 00:29:59,433
We don't follow it.

541
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,300
I mean, the pope says a lot of things.

542
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,467
"No premarital sex."

543
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,000
"Thank you very much.

544
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,267
Charming.
You are a charmer,
thank you.

545
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:12,500
Hey, kids, get in here.
Look, it's the pope.

546
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,933
Oh, it's like seeing
an albino tiger in the wild.

547
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:20,500
How much longer
are you gonna be able
to see that, the pope?"

548
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,900
"No masturbation."

549
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,300
"He's doing
all his greatest hits,
look at that."

550
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,667
You know?

551
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,233
"Thank you.
You're a fabulous
Catholic celebrity.

552
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,367
Now go back
to the castle."

553
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,033
Sometimes people say to me,

554
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,700
"Bill, you're prejudiced
against the Muslims."

555
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,300
No, I promise you I am not.

556
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,600
"Prejudiced" comes from prejudge.

557
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,400
I am not prejudging.
I am judging.

558
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,834
Yes, I am judging that
if your TGIF is beheadings...

559
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:58,567
and getting
stoned in your country
is a bad thing,

560
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,033
then, yes,
you're bringing up the rear,
civilization-wise.

561
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:04,433
You need an enlightenment,
you need a reformation,
you need something.

562
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:06,634
I don't feel bad for those 300 killers

563
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:08,367
we got down in Guantanamo Bay

564
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:12,233
always crabbing
about how we don't respect
their religious practices.

565
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:15,433
You know what? You lost.
Eat what we eat.

566
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:18,633
Here's
a cheese-filled Snausage.
Enjoy.

567
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,866
You don't like that, just eat the bun.

568
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:28,600
You don't like that?
Don't eat anything.
You won't be missed.

569
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,567
I would also say to them

570
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:34,200
that if we ever find the body
of a suicide attacker,

571
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,433
we will bury it wrong.
Wrong.

572
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:40,667
With a hooker and a bottle
of Jack Daniels...

573
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,333
facing Barney's.

574
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,967
That... that's the worst.

575
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,634
But you have to understand,
you have to embrace

576
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,734
the values of Western civilization

577
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:03,066
are not just different,
they are better, okay?

578
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,767
I know a whole generation
has been raised

579
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,500
on the notion of multiculturalism,

580
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,833
that all civilizations
are just different.

581
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:13,100
No, not always.
Sometimes things are better.

582
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,100
Rule of law is better
than autocracy and theocracy.

583
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,367
Equality of the sexes... better.

584
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,500
Protection of minorities... better.

585
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,400
Free speech... better.
Free elections... better.

586
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,934
Free appliances
with large purchases...
better.

587
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:43,100
Don't get so tolerant
that you tolerate intolerance.

588
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Remember what happened
to Salman Rushdie?

589
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,133
He wrote a book, it got mixed reviews.

590
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,167
Some people liked it,

591
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:53,500
some people wanted his head on a stick.

592
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,567
No one should have to die
for writing a book

593
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,066
with the exception of
"The Bridges of Madison County."

594
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:03,200
I will... I will make...

595
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,634
But, look,
I will always defend
the West, our way of life,

596
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:10,500
but I sure understand
why people hate us around
the world,

597
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,000
and that's not just Arabs
and not just Muslims.

598
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,534
Lots of people hate us,
and they're not all wrong.

599
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:18,300
I'll give you an example
just from our own hemisphere.

600
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,333
Do you know what Plan Colombia is?

601
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,966
Well, you get the first 12 CDs
for a penny.

602
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:27,400
No, that's...

603
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,966
No, Plan Colombia is a massive
defoliation program

604
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,667
that we have going
that our military is conducting

605
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:35,267
in the country of Colombia

606
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:37,500
that is ruining their countryside.

607
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,966
Why are we doing it?

608
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:42,567
Because there are some plants
down there that are evil.

609
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,300
How do we know they're evil?

610
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,200
Well, they don't have
Bristol-Myers Squibb,

611
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,333
Eli Lilly, or Pfizer written on them.

612
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,166
So...

613
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,100
And, by the way,
if cocaine gave you
an erection

614
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,367
instead of took one away,

615
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:05,433
not only would it be legal,
but Bob Dole would
do ads for it.

616
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,900
We do give the world the impression

617
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,133
that we think American lives
are more valuable

618
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,933
than anybody else's lives, which is odd

619
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,833
because we're supposed to be
a religious people,

620
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:20,333
and I thought God made humans
and not Americans.

621
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,600
But I didn't even know he was a prick.

622
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:26,033
I think people hate us around the world

623
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:29,267
because they perceive
that we waste when
we could share,

624
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,400
and they're not
totally wrong about that.

625
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,233
We are gluttonous.
We shop with forklifts.

626
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,966
We eat giant food off of giant plates.

627
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:45,133
We have a holiday
where we stuff food
into other food.

628
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,934
I mean...

629
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,933
Thanksgiving is really typical

630
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,367
of how we think
about third world
indigenous people.

631
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:01,933
We celebrate
the one nice moment
we ever had with the Indians.

632
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,866
It'd be like a date rapist saying,

633
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:07,734
"Let's concentrate
on the nice dinner we had
early in the evening..."

634
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,533
Yeah, I'm not...

635
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,433
You know, if you're an American

636
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:24,367
and you're born at this time
of the history, especially,

637
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:26,300
you're lucky.
We all are.

638
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,267
We won the world history
Powerball lottery.

639
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:32,600
But a little modesty about it
might keep the heat off of us,
you know?

640
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,833
I can't take people
who say things like,
"We built this country."

641
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:39,100
You built nothing.

642
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,633
I think the railroads were
pretty much up by 1980.

643
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,400
These are the same people
who always get all uppity
about immigration.

644
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,400
"They're taking
American jobs."

645
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,900
Yeah, right.

646
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,600
Like you'd stand on the freeway
and sell oranges out of a bag.

647
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:04,467
These poor people
swim through a river of sludge

648
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,767
to get here to park our cars,

649
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,333
pick our fruit, blow our leaves.

650
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:11,700
They do all the jobs
nobody else wants to do,

651
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,467
like landscaping
and impregnating Madonna.

652
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,000
And what do people say?
"Keep 'em out.

653
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,400
Build a wall."
Which is a dumb idea.

654
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,767
Walls never work.

655
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,734
The one they're building
in Israel isn't gonna work,

656
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:29,500
the Berlin Wall didn't work,

657
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,300
the Great Wall of China didn't work,

658
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,167
that invisible space diaphragm
that we're putting up there...

659
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,167
although that one, I must say...

660
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:40,966
When I read recently
that the North Korean guy,

661
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,667
Lil' Kim...

662
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,866
You know the guy?

663
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,233
When I read that he had
missiles that could reach
Los Angeles,

664
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:52,534
I was like,
"What is the delay with
the space shield, please?

665
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:56,000
Could we get
the magic umbrella
up and working?"

666
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:01,267
'Cause, you see,
danger focuses the mind.

667
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,800
I don't know why
that hasn't worked better
here already.

668
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,167
Like, especially at the airport.

669
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:06,767
You think that would be the one place

670
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:08,400
where it would've worked better.

671
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,100
And people say,
"Oh, things have gotten
better at the airport."

672
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,133
Really?
No, they've gotten whiter.

673
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,500
It looks to me
like they just fired
all the black people

674
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,667
and hired white people.

675
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,567
I don't know why,
but it used to be Shaniqua

676
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:24,066
with the eight-inch fingernails
going through my bag...

677
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:26,200
and now it's a white guy named Roy.

678
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,467
But... but white, black,
they're still using

679
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,467
the same method... random.

680
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,200
Random.

681
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
Al Gore famously
was pulled out of line.

682
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,300
Al Gore.

683
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,400
Now, come on,
he's two electoral votes
from being president,

684
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,233
but he's the terrorist?

685
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,900
At least that's how
they reported it on Fox News.

686
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,166
But, uh...

687
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,066
But, come on.

688
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,600
Do we really need to search Al Gore?

689
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,966
And they gave him the full search,

690
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,467
including the anal cavity search,

691
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,333
and they found his head.

692
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,200
Oh.

693
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:10,500
You know what?
You gotta get over that.

694
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,100
Al Gore lost that election
all by himself

695
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,866
by maintaining his pledge
to end charisma as we know it.

696
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:20,400
You gotta get over Florida,
Democrats, seriously.

697
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,167
The Republicans
did not steal that election.

698
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:27,166
It did fall off a truck...

699
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,866
but they didn't
exactly steal it.

700
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:32,667
But, no, I mean, come on,
at the airports,

701
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:35,233
it was over a year after 9/11

702
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:37,667
when people at the airport,
the authorities,

703
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,267
were still using the honor system.

704
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:42,734
Remember, we still
had to answer those
two brilliant questions...

705
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:45,700
"Did you pack
your own bags?"

706
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,233
"No, Allah packed my bags today.

707
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,066
What, bad answer?"

708
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:58,167
You know,
we still have to show
our ID three times.

709
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:01,167
That's the key,
three times before
you get on the plane,

710
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,800
'cause who could ever have a fake ID?

711
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,433
Bush's daughters had a fake ID.

712
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,066
Come on.

713
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,066
Yeah.

714
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:16,500
ID... like it's gonna say
"Carlos the Jackal"
right on it.

715
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,133
"Mr. The Jackal,
please step out of line."

716
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,767
The first thing they did
at LAX after the attack

717
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:27,200
to calm everybody's nerves
was they put out a decree:

718
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,634
no more curbside drop-offs

719
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,433
except by licensed people.

720
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:36,634
Only licensed taxis and limousines.

721
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,833
All of which, of course,
are driven by people

722
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:41,734
from Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Fuckyoustan,

723
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:44,967
We-hate-you-stan,
Shove-it-up-your-ass-stan.

724
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,966
You know, if that Republican
slogan machine

725
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,933
could just come up with
a better name than "profiling."

726
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:55,100
If they would just call it
"proactive intelligence
screening,"

727
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,567
people would go,
"It's about time we had
a little of that around here."

728
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:02,333
'Cause, you know,
it's good to be color-blind

729
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,767
and it's good to be ethnic-blind

730
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,900
and it's good to be religious-blind,

731
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,467
but at the end of the day,
blind does mean you can't see.

732
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:15,767
And if you can't see,
how are you gonna tell
what color it is

733
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:18,966
on the Terrorist Threat Advisory Chart?

734
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,133
'Cause, you know, I go by that thing.

735
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,367
Don't you?
'Cause, you know,
like, when it's yellow,

736
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:26,167
I'm pretty normal, you know.

737
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:30,233
I'm just... maybe...
maybe I look around
every four or five...

738
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:32,933
But when it's orange, I...

739
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:34,433
What, take a sweater?

740
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:37,934
I mean, what... what is the plan here?

741
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,100
Now, you know that we are not serious

742
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,100
about winning the terror war
for one simple reason.

743
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,567
Because we still have a drug war.

744
00:40:55,767 --> 00:41:00,133
I think it's very telling
that the last airport incident
I heard about before 9/11

745
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,600
was when Aaron Sorkin,
the brilliant writer/producer
of "The West Wing,"

746
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,400
got caught trying to take
mushrooms to Las Vegas.

747
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,500
Ooh, when I heard that, I said,

748
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,600
"What a great idea."

749
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,500
No wonder why this guy
wins the Emmy every year.

750
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,400
That's a brilliant way
to make that town bearable.

751
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,367
But...

752
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:28,734
But thank God they got him, huh?

753
00:41:28,934 --> 00:41:31,100
Because, you know,
if we start letting
creative people

754
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,100
take funny mushrooms
to resort cities...

755
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,400
what?
What would happen?
Please, tell me.

756
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,300
Take me down that slippery slope,

757
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,367
from Aaron Sorkin with his mushrooms

758
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:45,500
to your kid turning tricks
behind a dumpster
to make a fix.

759
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,933
Take me on that journey
and I will get behind
the drug war.

760
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,200
The police report said
that Mr. Sorkin's judgment

761
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,000
was impaired getting on the plane.

762
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I hope so.

763
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,933
Isn't that what we're trying for?

764
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:01,734
I mean, is he driving the plane?

765
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:05,433
'Cause if not,
why do we need judgment
on the plane?

766
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:10,500
"Peanuts, trail mix, I... I don't know.

767
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,600
I can't decide.

768
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,667
Four bucks for
the Sandra Bullock movie?

769
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:18,333
I-I...
My mind is cloudy."

770
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:24,467
Judgment impaired going to Las Vegas,

771
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,567
a town built on impairing
people's judgment.

772
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:30,066
Have you ever been to a casino?

773
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:32,400
There's no clocks, there's no oxygen,

774
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,100
they're plying you with liquor.

775
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,300
You need a police dog
just to find your way out.

776
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,167
But don't get fucked up on the way.

777
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:43,167
Let the professionals fuck you up.

778
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:46,133
That's...

779
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,900
Which...

780
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
Which is, by the way,

781
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,467
the official drug policy
of the United States
government.

782
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,333
I'm not kidding.
That is our drug policy.

783
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:00,800
Let the professionals fuck you up.

784
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,467
It's not like
we don't have drugs
in this country.

785
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,433
We got a million drugs.

786
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:06,300
Let the professionals do it, though.

787
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,800
Why is marijuana,
the one drug that never
killed anybody,

788
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,066
somehow on the illegal side
of the divide?

789
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:15,000
Why does every administration,
Democrat, Republican,

790
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,233
take the same stupid dodge about,

791
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:19,133
"We need to do more study"?

792
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,534
Yeah, they all study it.
You know what they found?

793
00:43:21,734 --> 00:43:24,433
It makes you eat cookie dough.

794
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,367
I think the drugs
that are a lot scarier

795
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,933
are the ones they advertise
on the 6:30 evening news.

796
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:38,367
Those...

797
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,500
I mean, they advertise
these prescription drugs
that...

798
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,333
Damned if I know what the problem is,

799
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,100
what the cure is.

800
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,400
It's just vaguely happy people.

801
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,533
Just... it's a woman in a wheat field.

802
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:01,066
She's just very happy about wheat.

803
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,567
I don't... you know...

804
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,233
There's one with a guy
dancing on a melting clock.

805
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:07,300
I'm not kidding.

806
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,033
He's dancing on a melting clock.

807
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:13,300
"You may not need"...
I don't care about need,
I want that one, okay?

808
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,534
That's... this is past need.

809
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:19,200
"Tell your doctor..."

810
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,800
Tell your doctor?

811
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,100
Shouldn't your doctor
tell you what drugs you need?

812
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,900
When you tell your doctor,

813
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,734
isn't he just a dealer at that point?

814
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,734
It's funny, in America,
half the people in this country

815
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:49,600
think that drugs
is what you have to regulate
to make us safer

816
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,333
and half the people think guns...

817
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:53,333
That's what you gotta regulate
to make us safer.

818
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:55,900
But I always think,
if you're gonna regulate
one thing

819
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,433
that has the most potential
to cause death and destruction...

820
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:02,433
Religion,
you gotta start
with religion.

821
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,300
I'm not...

822
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,267
I don't say this out of bitterness.

823
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:09,066
Look, I was raised Catholic.

824
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:11,534
But, you know, I was never molested.

825
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:14,734
And I'm a little insulted,
quite frankly.

826
00:45:14,934 --> 00:45:17,500
I guess they didn't find me attractive.

827
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,767
But, uh, I was attractive
and it's their loss.

828
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,667
I... I really understand
how this nightmare

829
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:27,900
of clerical pedophilia
could've happened,

830
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,500
because if you're a priest
and you spend your whole life

831
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,900
spewing this nonsense
about the snake and the whale

832
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,667
and the apple and the rib,

833
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:38,734
it's like,
"Oh, fuck it.
Just blow me, kid."

834
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,033
What the fuck?
Just...

835
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:48,567
Also, what is so hard

836
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:52,833
about just saying
the words, "I don't know"?

837
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:54,400
I don't know.

838
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,367
Of course there are questions
that plague all of us.

839
00:45:57,567 --> 00:46:00,667
How did we get here?
What happens when we die?

840
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:04,433
Is there a heaven?
Am I on the list?

841
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:08,467
Who let the dogs out?
Yes.

842
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:11,367
But why would you believe
what some other human being

843
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:14,467
whose brain, I promise you,
is no bigger or better
than yours...

844
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:18,467
When he tells you
he knows what happens
when you die?

845
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:19,700
"Don't masturbate now.

846
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,100
You won't get to hang out
with Jesus in heaven.

847
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,667
How do I know?
I... I've got a pointy hat.

848
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:28,333
I've got a hat and a robe

849
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:30,033
and I have smoke
and a wand."

850
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,933
It's so gay, the whole church.

851
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:34,933
It's just... could they just
come out of the closet?

852
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:37,767
Really?
I mean, it's just so...

853
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:40,600
You know, every Sunday,
it's such a pageant

854
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,300
with the costumes
and the wands and the goblets

855
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,133
and the smoke and the kneeling down

856
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:48,166
in front of another man
with your mouth open.

857
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,734
Nothing gay about that, no.

858
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,500
Nothing gay there.

859
00:46:58,266 --> 00:46:59,967
So...

860
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,700
are our religions corrupt?
Yes, of course they are.

861
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,333
But once again, I have to say,
their religions, even worse.

862
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,767
Even worse.
I mean, that thing
about the 72 virgins?

863
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:11,734
That's the lowest.

864
00:47:11,934 --> 00:47:14,033
Promising pussy in the afterlife

865
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:17,400
is the lowest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

866
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,433
I mean, I am no Christian,

867
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:25,400
but I do think Jesus
is a fantastic role model,

868
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,634
and the reason he is
is because he never said
anything like,

869
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:31,767
"Blessed are the meek
for they shall get laid."

870
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:38,167
Also, by the way, 72 virgins

871
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:40,300
is very suspicious to me.
It's a clue.

872
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,933
It tells you
we're dealing with people
from a bartering culture.

873
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:47,100
Because nobody starts with that number.

874
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,600
Somebody said,
"100 virgins." "50."

875
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,400
"85." "69." "79."

876
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,300
"71." "73." "72."
"Done."

877
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,400
That's how you got 72.

878
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:01,867
Yes.

879
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,900
We are dealing with people
from the Middle East.

880
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,467
Arabs and Jews
who have a lot more in common
than they would like to admit,

881
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,066
and one of the things
they have in common

882
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:14,066
is that they're from the Middle East,

883
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,200
which was called that
because it's in the middle.

884
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,734
Because everything that went
from Europe to Asia

885
00:48:19,934 --> 00:48:24,433
always through...
the commerce always had
to go through the middle.

886
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:28,533
That's why Columbus
was looking for another way.

887
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,267
And people said to him, "Chris,

888
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:35,233
if you take this journey,
you're gonna die."

889
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:40,600
And he said,
"I would rather sail off
the edge of the fucking world

890
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,066
than deal with those people
one more day!"

891
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:52,100
Have you been to the mall?

892
00:48:54,734 --> 00:48:57,367
But people
from the Middle East,
they are good with money.

893
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,333
That is in their history.
It is in their heritage.

894
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:02,933
Terrorists are very good
with money for that reason.

895
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:04,800
They're brilliant at laundering money.

896
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,467
It's the one thing they do launder.

897
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,467
Ooh, ooh, oh, Bill.

898
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:15,267
Don't make fun of the people
who attacked us.

899
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:18,433
No, it's true.
They know how to move things
through untraceable items,

900
00:49:18,633 --> 00:49:21,534
including... and I know
women hate to hear this...
diamonds.

901
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:23,933
A good way to fight terrorism...
Don't buy diamonds

902
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,600
'cause they move stuff
through diamonds.

903
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,833
And, well, I know women,
they hate to hear that

904
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:32,333
because women think about diamonds

905
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:33,833
the way men think about sex

906
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:36,767
the way leeches think about blood.

907
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,866
But diamonds have
a lot of blood on them

908
00:49:40,066 --> 00:49:41,534
even without the terrorist connection.

909
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:43,600
Take that away, they have
a lot of blood on them

910
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,800
because diamonds are mined
in Africa by rebel armies.

911
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,433
And the rebel armies
control the territory

912
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,500
and make the villagers
mine the diamonds,

913
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,767
and they control them through terror,

914
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:58,066
through such lovely things
as cutting off the arms
of the little children,

915
00:49:58,266 --> 00:50:00,866
something you never see
in the De Beers commercials.

916
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:02,833
Now, I told this to a woman recently

917
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,634
who is only
about the nicest person
I've ever met.

918
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:09,267
But she is a woman,
and I told her about Africa

919
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:11,367
and the armies and the rebels
and the terror

920
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:13,966
and the cutting off the arms
of the little children,

921
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:16,367
and she looked up at me
with a little sad face

922
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:19,266
and said,
"Both arms?"

923
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,367
I swear to God, that's a true story.

924
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:27,400
Now, I know it's the national
law here in America

925
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,300
that women are more evolved than men,

926
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,200
but if that's true, how come
they're still so impressed
by shiny objects?

927
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,500
I'm just asking.
I'm just asking.

928
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,433
Please, it is not anti-woman
just to talk about women, okay?

929
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:44,133
And we're going to do it now...

930
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,133
because when I say this is
a feminized country,

931
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:48,833
first of all, understand that I get it

932
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:51,433
that there are millions
and millions of women

933
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:53,300
who are steely-eyed realists

934
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,467
and millions
and millions of men
who are anything but.

935
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:58,734
However, for lack of a better term,

936
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:04,100
I would say
that the feminine values
are now the values of America.

937
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,667
Sensitivity is more important
than truth.

938
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:10,100
Feelings are more important than facts.

939
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,833
Commitment is more important
than individuality.

940
00:51:14,033 --> 00:51:16,600
Children are more important
than people.

941
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,500
Safety is more important than fun.

942
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,233
I always hear women say, you know,

943
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,066
"Married men live longer."

944
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:27,600
Uh, yes, and an indoor cat...

945
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,133
also...

946
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:32,934
lives longer.

947
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:35,966
It's a fur ball with a broken spirit

948
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:39,600
that can only look out
on a world it will never enjoy,

949
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,333
but it does technically live longer.

950
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,400
See, this is very personal to me

951
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,066
because I'm, like,
the last of my guy friends

952
00:51:50,266 --> 00:51:51,400
to have never gotten married,

953
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,367
and their wives,
they don't want them
playing with me.

954
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:57,167
You know, I...
I'm like the escaped slave.

955
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,233
I bring news of freedom, you know?

956
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:02,933
It's... it's not a good thing
to have me around, you know?

957
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:04,534
Keep the husbands in the dark.

958
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:06,266
They're happier that way.

959
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:10,900
So I know women
don't have it easy
in America,

960
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,500
but it is sort of politically incorrect

961
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,866
just to be male in this country now.

962
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,534
I mean, look at television.
Look at any sitcom.

963
00:52:18,734 --> 00:52:21,333
The wife is always
brilliant and ethereal

964
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:22,966
and right about everything.

965
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,267
And the husband is always a dumb fuck

966
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:27,900
lucky to have found her.

967
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,767
The only smart men
on television are Frasier
and his brother,

968
00:52:31,967 --> 00:52:35,600
both of whom are gayer
than Little Richard's
underpants.

969
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:42,534
So, I understand that women suffer,

970
00:52:42,734 --> 00:52:44,700
but I don't think
it's as much publicized

971
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,966
that a lot of men in America

972
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:50,267
are living lives of quiet desperation,

973
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,500
lobotomized of their libido,

974
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,567
anesthetizing themselves
with sports and pornography

975
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:58,567
and living in an Orwellian world

976
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:01,667
where we have to pretend to concur

977
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:03,966
with the woman's point of view.

978
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:05,500
On any TV show in America,

979
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,667
if somebody got up there and said,

980
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:08,133
"You know, women are smarter than men,"

981
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:10,267
automatic round of applause.

982
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:12,167
If somebody said,
"Men are smarter than women,"

983
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:13,433
you'd be booed off the stage.

984
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:15,634
I mean,
what does that tell you
about our culture

985
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:19,800
that we have to pretend
that one sex is smarter
than the other?

986
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,600
Women are smarter than men.

987
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,933
If women ran the world,
there'd be no wars.

988
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:29,367
Being pregnant is sexy.

989
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:32,634
You know, just a whole roster of things

990
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,900
that we don't really believe,
but we pretend to believe

991
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,800
because it's easier to make women nod

992
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,066
than to live in the doghouse.

993
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:43,800
I heard one
on daytime TV
the other day.

994
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,567
Only a woman could've said this,

995
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,833
and of course everyone
pretended it was true.

996
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:52,367
She said,
"A couple should explore
their mutual fantasies."

997
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:58,500
There are no such things
as mutual fantasies.

998
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:02,967
Yours bore us, ours offend you.

999
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:07,633
Trust me.

1000
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,200
Ladies, trust me,
there is no fantasy
where a handsome prince

1001
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,567
runs to you across a meadow
and takes you in his arms

1002
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:21,133
and pledges his undying love

1003
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:23,934
and then comes on your face, okay?

1004
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,700
That would be a mutual fantasy

1005
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,266
if you've ever seen a porn movie.

1006
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:39,833
But I think...
I think men are just tired

1007
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:41,800
of apologizing for being men,

1008
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,400
and I think women
would be a lot happier

1009
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,966
if you'd stop making us
apologize for it.

1010
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,400
You'd save yourselves
a lot of wear and tear.

1011
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,000
For one thing, give you one example,

1012
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,734
no woman in America
would ever get breast implants.

1013
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:54,900
Because if you really
got inside the man's mind,

1014
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,534
you'd understand
that it's never about
big or little

1015
00:54:58,734 --> 00:55:01,634
or short or tall or blonde or brunette.

1016
00:55:01,834 --> 00:55:06,133
It's only about old and new.

1017
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,033
Hugh Grant had
Elizabeth Hurley at home.

1018
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:15,000
He wanted Marvin Hagler in a wig.

1019
00:55:22,066 --> 00:55:25,000
You cannot reform biology.

1020
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,966
And, by the way,
the male impetus
to spread our seed

1021
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,966
is why we are a successful species.

1022
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:33,167
That is why
we're sitting here
right now.

1023
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:36,667
But do we get thanks for it?
No, we get impeached.

1024
00:55:41,066 --> 00:55:42,300
Hey, you know what?

1025
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,400
That whole election
was a feminized issue

1026
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,833
because that 2000 election
was all about the Republican
marketing machine.

1027
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:53,233
They were able to morph
monogamy into integrity

1028
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,400
the same way they morphed
bin Laden into Hussein.

1029
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,066
I mean, Bush's whole campaign was all,

1030
00:55:58,266 --> 00:56:00,500
"We're gonna
be restoring integrity."

1031
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,567
Well, excuse me, but the Bush family,

1032
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:04,567
especially when they're running
for the White House,

1033
00:56:04,767 --> 00:56:07,400
has no more integrity
than anybody else.

1034
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,833
They do what they have to
to win like everybody else.

1035
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,966
Maybe they don't have less,
but they don't have more.

1036
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:16,400
The difference is
they fuck their wives.

1037
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,100
And that's what he ran on.
"I fuck my wife!

1038
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,400
I'm a wife fucker!
I have integrity!

1039
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,367
I fuck my wife!

1040
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:27,634
Unlike a certain president
I could name.

1041
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:30,433
And his vice president
who 'was there.'"

1042
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:33,000
"Was there."
They make it sound
like Al Gore

1043
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,933
was holding Monica's hair, you know?

1044
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:38,500
"Come on, babe.

1045
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,866
Come on, honey, finish up.

1046
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:45,066
I got Arafat waiting
in the Rose Garden here, babe."

1047
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:47,933
I mean, come on.

1048
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:52,000
"The Starr Report"
was a marketing document.

1049
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,567
It had nothing to do with the law

1050
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:56,033
and had everything to do
with making sure

1051
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:59,534
everybody knew
all the lurid little details,

1052
00:56:59,734 --> 00:57:04,800
like that one of their trysts
took place on Easter.

1053
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:09,500
That's right,
the president had his dick

1054
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,834
in a Jew's mouth on Easter!

1055
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:18,567
Run against that, motherfucker!

1056
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:22,933
And Al Gore took the bait.

1057
00:57:23,133 --> 00:57:24,900
That's why Al Gore tried to prove

1058
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,267
that he loved his wife even more.

1059
00:57:26,467 --> 00:57:28,000
Remember he kissed her
at the convention?

1060
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,467
That disgusting kiss?

1061
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:32,033
Have you ever seen
anything so disgusting?

1062
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:34,200
Can you imagine any other politician?

1063
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,400
Can you imagine Richard Nixon?

1064
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,533
"Come here,
Pat, you bitch."

1065
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,834
I'm gonna chew
on your ass, you little"...

1066
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:44,933
But that was Al Gore's way of saying,

1067
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:47,400
"I fuck my wife, too."

1068
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,333
And a week later,
George Bush let himself
get caught on camera

1069
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:53,267
grabbing his wife's ass

1070
00:57:53,467 --> 00:57:55,000
'cause that's his way of saying,

1071
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,933
"Oh, you're not gonna steal
the integrity issue from us.

1072
00:57:58,133 --> 00:58:00,700
We're the wife fuckers
in this election!

1073
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,634
I fuck my wife,
my brother fucks his wife,

1074
00:58:03,834 --> 00:58:06,233
my dad even fucks his wife.

1075
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:08,966
And that's
a lot of integrity."

1076
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:11,133
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1077
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:12,383
You're a great crowd.

1078
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,200
Thank you.

1079
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,734
I appreciate you coming out!

1080
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,433
Thank you!

1081
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:23,900
Thank you, folks.

1082
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:26,633
Thank you very much.
