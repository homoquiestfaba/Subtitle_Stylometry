1
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,800
James Dean was the man.

2
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,925
Everything he did was cool.

3
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:57,363
The way he walked was cool.

4
00:00:57,364 --> 00:00:58,930
The way he talked was cool.

5
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,367
The way he smoked
cigarettes was the coolest.

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,445
Can you imagine
James Dean smoking

7
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,165
one of these fucking things?

8
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,725
Absolutely no cool factor,

9
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,210
you know what I'm saying?

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,927

Roy Boyle, right?

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,051
Well, this is a good day.

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,243
I was hoping
I'd get a chance to meet you.

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,086
Say you used to be something
back in the day.

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,725
I mean, personally...
no offense,

15

The other night,

51
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,282
a couple nights ago,
I saw a shooting star

52
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,279
and I made a wish

53
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,839
that I could
take all of your pain

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,888

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,004
I said it out loud!

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,410

proud wearing those dog tags.

61
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,285
They're so shiny.

62
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,571
Hey, guess what today is.

63
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,599
Uh, uh...
Is it your birthday?

64
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,170
No, it's not my birthday.

65
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
It's Friday,

66
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,124
which means China Doll's
having her famous dumplings.

67
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,484

I can smell them from here.

68

liked that smell, right?

00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,046

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,805
I can hear chewing
every damn thing.

178
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:57,564
Crazy people I work for.

179
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,405
You're fired,

180
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,650
but I'm gonna let you know when.

181
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,411
I hope there's not
any meat in this thing,

182
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,084
because it's Good Friday,
and you know I can't eat meat.

183
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,962
I mean, I can but...

184
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,931
yeah, don't get me wrong.
I love meat,

185
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,611
just not today.

186
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,119
What?

187
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,326
Excuse me, I'm try...

188
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,769
Never mind.

189
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,885
Sorry, Jesus.

190
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,845
Are you an ex-marine?

191
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,039
Um, well, I am a marine.

192
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,283
You're never a former or an ex.

193
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,641
Once a marine, always a marine.

194
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,206
Lieutenant Roy Boyle,

195
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,519
Special Forces.
Very honorable.

196
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,648
Thank you.
Though I got to tell you,

197
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:04,086
that Vietnam, phew,
that was hard.

198
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,650
Get inside, woman.

199
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,526
LuAnn is having problems with
that damn register again.

200
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,921
And I told you to stop
feeding these damn bums.

201
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,839
I'm not a bum.

202
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,286
Uh, Grant Hodges.

203
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,490
You sure look like a damn bum,

204
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,960
and you got on dog tags
like you were a marine.

205
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,285
You weren't no damn marine.

206
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
You were.

207
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,680
Look at you now.

208
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,482
You're a damn disgrace.
Clean up, boy.

209
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
<i>Pitiful.</i>

210
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,559
Pitiful. Oh, come on now.

211
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,639
That ain't necessary.

212
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,244
We're not doing anything wrong.

213
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,879
Oh, is that right?

214
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,530
Let me ask you a question:

215
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,847
Those signs that you
and every other vagrant carry,

216
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,086
is there some sort of...

217
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,959
homeless union code

218
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,201
or something on how big
the sign should be?

219
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,719
And tell me this:

220
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,799
Where do you all get
those magic markers from

221
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,643
to write on the sign,
and who writes them damn signs?

222
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,849
Stop being a dick, alright?
Just stop being a dick.

223
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,681
You've got some mouthful,
you street rat.

224
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:20,966
Oh, you said your piece.

225
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,929
He did nothing wrong
to you, okay?

226
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,690
You don't have to rub it in.

227
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,931
If you've got beef, do it
with your wife, alright?

228
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:31,729
My beef is with your ass.

229
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,890
You get your shit together,
clean up like I said.

230
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,839
Hey Roy, um...
I hope you're not angry with me

231
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,081
that I told Suzie
that I was you.

232
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:00,923
It's just that, urn...

233
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,839
I don't know. This is...

234
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,804
pretty much the only
thing I have in my life

235
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,323
that means something to me.

236
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,448
No, that's fine.
I'm not angry at all, Grant.

237
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,959
In fact,

238
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,479
I'm sure if you're a marine,

239
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,811
you'd make a pretty
amazing soldier.

240
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:16,679
Really? Wow.
Um, thanks, Roy.

241
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,604
Um, wow.
Thank you.

242
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,839
Want these back?

243
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,171
Nah, you keep 'em.

244
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,485
It means more to you
than it does to me, okay?

245
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,887
Sit down.

246
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,365
What the hell
is all this talking

247
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,042
I'm hearing about you knocking

248
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:56,520
people's American flags
down off their lawn?

249
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,682
You can't go around doing that

250
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:02,044
just because you're pissed off
with the President.

251
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:04,930
You're a soldier yourself,
you all know better than that.

252
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,005
I hear you doing
that one more time,

253
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:11,479
I'm going to lock you up
for a week, you understand?

254
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,481
Yes, sir.

255
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,681
Alright.
Go on, get the hell out of here

256
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:17,841
and go get them damn
blueberry pancakes,

257
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:19,649
or whatever the
hell it is you eat.

258
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,442
You better watch
that cholesterol, boy.

259
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,999
Hello Sunshine, how are you?

260
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,322
What would you like today?
Suzie's dumplings, maybe?

261
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,288
Ping-bang-bang-bang
Bing-bang-bing-bang.

262
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,723
Ping-pang-ping-pang-ping.

263
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:51,764
Nobody's gonna give
a damn about that.

264
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,522
I'm gonna get me
some Rosetta Stone

265
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,887
and learn every damn
thing you talking.

266
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,965
Against the dying of the light,

267
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,281
there can be no
mercy for any force

268
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,284
blocking his path from
his righteousness.

269
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,085
Wife is having a bath.

270
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Is that right'?

271
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Yup.

272
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,565
Got everything you
need all packed up

273
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,244
and ready to go
right here, baby.

274
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
What's that?

275
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,922
This is the master plan;

276
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,849
Port's city there...

277
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,881
the battleship...

278
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
checkpoint.

279
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,886
Nice.

280
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Let's do this.

281
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,765
Listen,
I'm not judging or anything,

282
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:00,730
but the first time should
be special, memorable.

283
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,319
It was, Damiano.

284
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,359
15 dollars, 15 minutes.

285
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,091
Melody.

286
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,685
You boppin'
strippers now, Fully?

287
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:13,839
Ooh, who was that?
Gonna miss these days?

288
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,524
Yeah, I'll miss it bro.
Hoorah.

289
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,399
<i>- Hey.-
- Hey.-</i>

290
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,162
ls there where the party's at?

291
00:22:24,163 --> 00:22:25,525
<i>Yes, ma'am.
Come on in.</i>

292
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,286
God damn, woo.

293
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,606
Where's the music at?
Turn that music up, boys.

294
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
It's time to party.

295
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,999
I see somebody's been
partying over here

296
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
like a sleeping beauty.

297
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,079
Oh, shit! That's my song!

298
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,206
Turn it up, boys!

299
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:47,239
<i>Woo!</i>

300
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,208
Woo,
that's what I'm talking about!

301
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,525
Who's up, who's up?

302
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,486
I need a boy who's awake who
can hammer this, alright?

303
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:55,599
Yeah, Dam! Woo.

304
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
<i>I'm up!</i>

305
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,799
Yeah, girl. Hoorah.

306
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,446
Bend it over for me.
Bend it over for me.

307
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:05,404
Yeah, you gonna miss
this whore, Dom?

308
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:07,319
You're gonna miss this, boy.
Let me tell you.

309
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
<i>Yeah, girl, woo!</i>

310
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,322
What the fuck is wrong
with you, bitch?

311
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,244
You've got no shit boy, no shit!

312
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,919
The other day, some

313
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,646
group came by and tried
to sell me on an idea:

314
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:41,961
building a paintball
park on my land

315
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,483
so they could play war games.

316
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,164
I mean, who the hell needs that?

317
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,484
Oh, it doesn't sound that bad.

318
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,649
You have a nice piece of land.

319
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,839
So you told me Lincoln was
on your land one time?

320
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,363
Well, I mean,
that's how all this scuttlebutt

321
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:00,165
started about these
tunnels, you know?

322
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,447
So, I guess they connected
that with Lincoln.

323
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,004
Oh, that's right,
those famous tunnels

324
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:06,485
start right here at your house

325
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,482
and end up at the
White House shitter.

326
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:11,839
Yeah, but I'll tell you
what, man. It's true.

327
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,123
One of these goddamn things

328
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:14,685
is right here in my basement.

329
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,279
I mean, Larry didn't believe me.

330
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,816
He came by the other day.
I showed it to him.

331
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,207
Guy asks a lot of stupid
ass questions, man.

332
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,519
Like uh,

333
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,319
"You think they
can get a golf cart

334
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,162
in one of those tunnels?"
I mean, how dumb is that?

335
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,679
I don't know.

336
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,841
I think Larry
smokes a little too much

337
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:27,842
of that wacky tobacco.

338
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,479
They built the tunnels

339
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,050
to help Lincoln escape
during the Civil War.

340
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:35,040
I don't think they had golf
carts back in those days.

341
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,530
See, that didn't make
any sense at all,

342
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,245
what you're saying right there.

343
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:41,289
Why would Lincoln escape
from the White House,

344
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,885
come through a tunnel and end
up in the heart of Dixie?

345
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,844
It doesn't make any
goddamn sense.

346
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:50,002
I mean, if there are
tunnels downstairs,

347
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,521
and say there are,

348
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,719
there would have to be something

349
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,210
a little bit more
diabolical about it,

350
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,168
otherwise
that's just urban legend.

351
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,363
Yeah, that's a possibility.

352
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,089
But I know what I got, dawg.

353
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,287
Did you just call me dawg?

354
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
That's urban.

355
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,402
No look man, I mean,
let me tell you something.

356
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,281
The land may be silent...

357
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,763
but it has a lot to say.

358
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,249
All the memories
of all those wars,

359
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,323
all the blood spilled
on this land? Man.

360
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,605
Well,
you're referring to the wars

361
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:29,045
between the Indian tribes

362
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:31,199
or the war between the States?

363
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,362
No, no, no.
I'm talking about the big battle

364
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,719
of Fort Fisher, man,

365
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,456
where the Union soldiers
kick the Confederate's ass,

366
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,959
and they had this stupid-ass,
crazy-ass general

367
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,759
named General... um, Bragg.

368
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,239
He tried to burn down the
whole goddamn city, man.

369
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,208
He burned down all
the supply depots.

370
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
But after that,

371
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,366
all hell broke loose, man.

372
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,966
There were more wars
than you can think of.

373
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,801
Blood was spilled all
over this goddamn land.

374
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,363
It's said that all the ponds

375
00:25:57,364 --> 00:25:58,885
were running red with blood.

376
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
That's true.

377
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,841
I didn't know that.

378
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,405
Alright, buddy.
I gotta go.

379
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,362
Come on, man, where you going?
Where you going?

380
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,486
I ain't finished yet.
I got more to tell you.

381
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,125
Of course you're not finished.

382
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:15,327
You tell me the same
damn story every night.

383
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,644
Yeah, but I'll tell
you what, man,

384
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,880
it's really sad.

385
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,839
Brothers killing brothers,

386
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,639
friends killing friends,

387
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,846
that's what's sad.

388
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,846
You're right.

389
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,607
It is sad,
brothers killing brothers.

390
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,081
But you know what?

391
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,479
You gotta admire them

392
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,479
for sticking to their guns
no matter what the cause.

393
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,481
You're right.

394
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,319
See you around, old buddy.

395
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
I'm here, dawg.

396
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Okay.

397
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,159
Excuse me, Gunny?

398
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,650
I got something you
need to listen to.

399
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,959
Must be a fluke.

400
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,644
They said something about
everything's in order,

401
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:38,404
but I don't detect
a threat here.

402
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,168
What exactly did you
intercept, Corporal?

403
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,965
Uh, transmission stated,

404
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,719
battleship is secure,

405
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,404
Operation Magenta is a go.

406
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,526
Tunnels need securing
and checkpoint <i>72</i> hours.

407
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,165
Then static, Gunny.

408
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,403
Have you picked up
any other radio chatter

409
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:55,839
about battleships?

410
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,126
Negative.
Just this message.

411
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,921
Port City,
that's a small tourist town.

412
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:03,284
They have the U.S.S.
North Carolina there.

413
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:05,244
It's been there since 1962,
but...

414
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,641
that old girl's nothing
more than a museum now.

415
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,241
It sounds like we've
stumbled upon some kids

416
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:12,607
playing war games on
their walkie-talkies.

417
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,083
Disregard, Corporal.
I give it these are no threat.

418
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:17,127
- Roger that.
- Carry on.

419
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,165
When does Leo report?

420
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Soon.

421
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
Get rid of him.

422
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,847
I am pregnant.

423
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,919
What?

424
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,679
Really? Really? Oh!

425
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,959
Do you mind?

426
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,166
May I have your
attention, please?

427
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,446
What's up?
Knock 'em.

428
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,159
You're hurting me, man.

429
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:51,164
What are you doing?

430
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,321
Hey, just chill out.

431
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:53,651
I'm having a little girl.

432
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,519
Oh!

433
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,039
Way to go there.
Okay...

434
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,361
You know, you'd like
to put a helmet on it.

435
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:06,399
Okay, as you've heard
from the man himself,

436
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,239
we should congratulate
the Boyle family

437
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,322
for your newest
announced addition.

438
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,159
Okay?

439
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,844
May you be blessed and loved

440
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,079
and... and secure

441
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,401
knowing that she has two older
brothers to protect her,

442
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:22,479
not to mention two
very capable parents.

443
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,719
Okay?

444
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,039
Roy's been my best
friend for years.

445
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,087
And tonight, we're celebrating

446
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:29,003
his going-away party again.

447
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,642
Okay? He's headed out there
to do what he does best,

448
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:36,041
which is protect this
great land of ours.

449
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,006
As you owe me,

450
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,044
make us proud my friend
because it's seven months,

451
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,122
when you return to Port City,

452
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,439
father, husband,
friend and hero,

453
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,249
we'll be here waiting for you.

454
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,719
I'm tearing up already.

455
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Okay?

456
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,242
To Roy Boyle, salute!

457
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,285
Hey Roy, you wanted to
take a walk with me?

458
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:02,679
Um, it might be fun.

459
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,044
Maybe we could hear
more about the, uh,

460
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:08,089
the troops coming from the
tunnel in the battleship.

461
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,362
No, hey, I'm just
gonna crash, man.

462
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,885
Which troops you talking about?

463
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:17,685
Well, sometimes, when I'm, uh,

464
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:20,001
down at the dumpster,
I hear these people talking,

465
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:22,199
and uh... I don't know.

466
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,883
It's probably someone with
their TV turned up too loud.

467
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:25,961
What are they saying?

468
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,201
I think it's the show
about the military,

469
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:33,519
um, uh, it's about
this battleship

470
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,889
that comes up the Potomac
and blows up Washington.

471
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,079
And then they kill
the President,

472
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,959
and uh, take over the country.

473
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,439
Oh, shit.

474
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,166
Underground troops coming
up into the White House.

475
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,322
Oh boy, that sounds
action-packed, huh?

476
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,769
I wonder if it stars
Bruce Willis.

477
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,919
Yeah, it's gotta be TV.

478
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,879
Um, well I'm off.

479
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,645
- Uh, you sure you wanna come?
- Nah. I'm good, thanks.

480
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,124
Hey, buddy.
Come here.

481
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,881
Where's Boyle?

482
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,479
Who?

483
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,164
Roy Boyle, the guy you've
been hanging out with.

484
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:18,479
Look mister, I don't know.

485
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,801
Okay. I get it. You're
protecting his whereabouts.

486
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:22,359
I understand that,

487
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,169
but you guys don't need
to be on the street.

488
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,928
Look mister,
I don't want any trouble.

489
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,886
Okay, fair enough.

490
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,999
Tell him to get a hold of TJ.

491
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,565
Farming season is coming up.

492
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:35,891
I need some extra hands.

493
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,806
I don't pay much.

494
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,162
I could provide you
with three hots,

495
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:41,163
a cot,

496
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,319
safe bathroom.

497
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,205
Ultimately,
it's a safe place to stay.

498
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:47,043
You guys need to be
off the streets.

499
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,921
Okay?

500
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,683
Okay, then.
You tell him to talk to TJ.

501
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,928
There's no TV in there.

502
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440

what are you doing here?
Everything all right?

510
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:37,006
Yeah, yeah.
I was...

511
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,206
gonna ask you the same thing.

512
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,921
You left this behind.

513
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
Come on in.

514
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,606
Make yourself at home.

515
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,239
Forgetting your piece?

516
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,679
What's up with that, man?

517
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,091
You getting
Alzheimer's or something?

518
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:53,889
I guess I got a lot on my mind.

519
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,559
Oh, okay.

520
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,886
I mean, it's not that little

521
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,802
Asian chick at the diner, is it?

522
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:01,164
Oh, definitely not her.
That was a long time ago, buddy.

523
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,321
Well, you know she's
married to a brother?

524
00:35:03,322 --> 00:35:05,721
I wouldn't piss him off,
if I was you.

525
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,366
You know what I mean?
I don't think he's all there.

526
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,124
Yeah, you're right about that.

527
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,966
What can I say? I'm just
feeling a little bluesy.

528
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,844
You don't want me to
bust out crying, do you?

529
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:17,285
No, no.
Please don't do that.

530
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:18,439
Want a drink?

531
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,643
No, no. I can't do that, man.

532
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:20,879
I gotta go to church tomorrow.

533
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,961
Come on.
Here you go.

534
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,439
No, no.

535
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,200
We got a little of that
moonshine Corey made.

536
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,126
Come on, brother.
No, no, no.

537
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
A chill of vanilla?

538
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,643
Here's to our friends who
aren't here anymore.

539
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:39,165
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

540
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,039
Atta boy.

541
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,159
Boy?
I got your boy.

542
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,201
Man.

543
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,491
Did I say boy?
I meant Roy.

544
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,360

You know, it's an
awesome time for...

565
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:31,439
for us to share

566
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,090
the true meaning of Easter.

567
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,804
Make sure you bring
her next week.

568
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:38,167
Very good.
My man, Chester.

569
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,519
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah.

570
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,648
All thanks to you, my head, huh?

571
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,962
You got my message.
Thank you for coming.

572
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:48,799
Everything alright, Bonnie?

573
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,724
No. I need to talk to you
about something serious.

574
00:37:51,725 --> 00:37:52,846
Alright.

575
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,719
Come on.

576
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,163
I'm a bit concerned.
This is so unlike her.

577
00:37:57,164 --> 00:38:00,084
Becks is always here.
She never misses my services,

578
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,810
especially Easter.

579
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,889
When's the last
time you saw her?

580
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,243
The middle of last week, she...

581
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,568
she won a jackpot
on bingo night.

582
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:09,721
Jackpot?

583
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,043
Maybe her and Larry

584
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:13,845
took the loot and went on down

585
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:15,166
to Myrtle Beach for the night.

586
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,810
I got to run a few errands.

587
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,369
I'll head over there
and I'll check in on 'em.

588
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,839
Thank you.

589
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,490
Don't you worry about a thing,
Reverend Bonnie.

590
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:25,847
- Thank you very much.
<i>- I'll</i> take care of it.

591
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Oh!

592
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,841
You!

593
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,691
Are you alone today?

594
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,365
No, no, no. Come, come.
Come with me.

595
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:58,044
Come.
I have something for you.

596
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,849
Come, come.
Come.

597
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,967
<i>Here.</i>

598
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,644
<i>Eat some of Suzie's dumplings.</i>

599
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,041
Here you go.

600
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
Eat, eat.

601
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,809
Where's little
soldier boy today?

602
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,681
You scare me.
You give me a heart attack,

603
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:22,039
just like your food.

604
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,201
What did I say to you?

605
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,167
What?

606
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Get inside.

607
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,967
Yeah, whatever.
Kung-fu to you, too.

608
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
<i>You're damn shame.</i>

609
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,769
<i>You are an embarrassment.</i>

610
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,319
You and your good off

611
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,971
rat friend keep
digging in my trash can.

612
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,611
I might mistake
you for a raccoon

613
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,205
and shoot your ass.

614
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,049
You know,
raccoon is some good eating.

615
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,930
Pull yourself together.

616
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,364
And that woman
with the cleaning.

617
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:40,845
Every time I walked in,

618
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:42,565
the furniture would
be all moved around.

619
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,679
The sofas would be facing
the opposite direction

620
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,602
of the television.

621
00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:47,639
You know,

622
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,606
this beautiful little girl
has told me a lot about you.

623
00:40:49,607 --> 00:40:50,607
She did?

624
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,403
Is it... is it good or bad?

625
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:54,162
Because I feel like
I'm nerdy and awkward,

626
00:40:54,163 --> 00:40:56,045
and sometimes I can hear people.

627
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:57,166
Relax. It's all good.

628
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:58,399
It's everything

629
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,039
to do with the
amount of homework

630
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,451
- you give this little girl.
- Well, okay,

631
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:02,963
then that'd actually be true.

632
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:04,319
Well, it's a good thing.

633
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,481
- Oh, hi. Hi.
- How are you?

634
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,685
What can I get you this morning?

635
00:41:07,686 --> 00:41:09,808
This'll shock you,
but two cheeseburgers.

636
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,006
The first one with fries,

637
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:13,639
strawberry shake,

638
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,484
second one with onion
rings and a Coke please.

639
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:17,679
Okay.

640
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,125
Would you like anything to eat?

641
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,521
You know, they have
some wonderful dessert.

642
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,362
They have peach cobbler,
apple pie...

643
00:41:23,363 --> 00:41:25,488
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're all out of peach.

644
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,684
The big deputy, he ate
everything. He ate all of it.

645
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,011
Ugh, dufus.

646
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,449
The chick is certifiably crazy.

647
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,879
Certified, huh?

648
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,159
I'm telling you.

649
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,719
I got the shrink
bills to prove it.

650
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
<i>Stacks.</i>

651
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,006
Go ahead, Sheriff.

652
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,366
<i>I'm going to
head on out to Larry</i>

653
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,486
<i>and Beck's place.</i>

654
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,123
Copy that.
I'll meet you out there in 15.

655
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,202
Gotta go to bounce
and Larry coroners.

656
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,043
- You got this?
- I got this.

657
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:52,719
Alright, cool.
I'll buy the beer.

658
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Tea.

659
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,571
- Okay.
- Enjoy-

660
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,326
Okay, so what branch of the
service was your husband?

661
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,088
You served? Really?

662
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,405
Yes.

663
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:06,401
Come on.

664
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:08,679
Army, medic.
Husband?

665
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,405
You haven't been
listening at all.

666
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:12,364
What, do I look like
a soldier to you?

667
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:14,328
She's too beautiful
to be a soldier.

668
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,206
My dad was in Iraq, too.

669
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,039
Really?

670
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,879
Easy, Cass.
Easy, easy.

671
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,120
Don't talk like that.

672
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,279
Don't drink that too fast

673
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,601
or you'll get one of those...
ice cream headaches.

674
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,650
Well, tell me about it, soldier.

675
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,880
Not a soldier, doll.

676
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
I'm a marine.

677
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,719
That's right.

678
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,999
Marines aren't
soldiers are they?

679
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,081
They're marines.

680
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,399
Proud.

681
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,606
Very proud to be a marine.

682
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,521
Desert Storm,

683
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,849
trained hand-to-hand
combat expert,

684
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,399
part of the team

685
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,686
that launched the first
Patriot missile.

686
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:52,759
So I mean, there's absolutely

687
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,923
no question I am a
very proud marine.

688
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,119

It looks like they fought,
he drowns her,

706

then he comes in here
and swallows his pistol.

707
00:43:59,522 --> 00:44:01,761

708
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,805
They were both murdered.

00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,520

713
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,679

714
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,887

795
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,282
But you got to snap
back to reality.

796
00:49:08,283 --> 00:49:11,599
Look, go check...
go to the TVNN site,

18 months and this is...

00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,080
They were killed, okay?

806
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,360
Our brothers.

807
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,919
Something...

808
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,969
something is not right here

You're accusing our town

815
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:53,764
of some kind of
homegrown terrorism?

816
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,406
That's nuts.

817
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,240
People we see every day?

818
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,567

819
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,282
That's crazy talk, man,
just crazy talk.

820
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,126

822
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,166
Grant was onto something.

823
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,959
Grant, the man talks to walls.

824
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,960
Don't judge!

825
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,801
Check it out!

826
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,399
Do some police work

827
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,890
instead of being a
party-fighter for the

828
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,291
sake of our town.

829
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,366

It's been a rough kind of day.

856

My one friend turned up dead

857
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,008

Oh, hi!

859
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,163

you would be here.

860
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,762

Yeah, yeah right.

Oh, you got the controls.
What, do you own the place?

865
00:52:04,046 --> 00:52:05,326
Home away from home, dawg.

866
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,770

867
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,167
Classic martini.

868
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,959
Gin or vodka?

869
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,960
Vodka.

870
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,887

872
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Twist.

873

Yes, ma'am.

It's very sweet.

884
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,841
Oh, we've known each
other 32 years.

885
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,846
32 years?

886

Man, you never could count.

887
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,879
It's more like 42.

888
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,008
I've known you since
kindergarten.

889
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,807

Kenny and I talked and...

892
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,245
we don't want to press charges.

893
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,004
This poor man has
been through so much.

894
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:13,885
We don't want to
damage him anymore.

895
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:15,962
Maybe he should see a
doctor or something.

896
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,611
That's very nice to hear.

897
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,926
I got to get going-

898
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,805
Donna,
you got that sandwich ready?

899
00:53:23,806 --> 00:53:24,926
<i>It's right here, Tom.</i>

900
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,679
Let me get a round of
tequilas for everybody.

901
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,719
<i>You got it.</i>

902
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,881
Here you go.

903
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,881
<i>Thank you.</i>

904
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,080
Alright. Drink up, everybody.
Have a good day.

905
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,799
See you, Thomas.

906
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,801
Have a nice one, dawg.

907
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,881
Hey?

908
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,320
Suzie?

909
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Suzie?

910
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,646
Suzie?

911
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,841
Oh, hi.

912
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,930
What are you doing here?

913
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,846
Are you okay?

914
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,882
So thoughtful.

915
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,805
What are you doing?
What the hell?

916
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,927
Let me go

917
00:56:06,928 --> 00:56:08,119
and I'll tell you!

918
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
I'll tell you!

919
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,239
Let me go!

920
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,810
You tell me first
and I'll let you go.

921
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,527
Okay.

922
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,080
Okay, okay.

923
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,721
The Sheriff... the Sheriff...

924
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,365
go to Chester's house

925
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,087
is the checkpoint, okay?

926
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,568
See? I tell you.
Now you let me go.

927
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,326
I'm sorry, I can't.

928
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,400
I ain't a part of this.

929
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,359
Someone's right.

930
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,089
The street rat came in

931
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,006
and then the Sheriff popped up

932
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:31,485
in the alley to talk to her,

933
00:57:31,486 --> 00:57:33,289
and then she
snuck off to the bar.

934
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,085
She fed a lot of people.

935
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,011
She sneaked food out
to the back to women

936
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,800
and then they vanished.

937
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,448
I didn't think nothing
of it at first.

938
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,882
Hell, I didn't even know
that we owned this.

939
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,039
But she didn't know
that I could read lips.

940
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,281
Today, the Sheriff came by
and he told her

941
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,361
to get ready,

942
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,123
and that they'll meet
at the checkpoint.

943
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,167
So, what do we do?

944
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,606
I know someone...

945
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,446
he'll know what to do.

946
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,120
I checked out your story.

947
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,884
- I dug around.
- And?

948
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,886
I got to wait for the Sheriff.

949
00:58:25,887 --> 00:58:27,370
He'll know what to do with this,

950
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:28,479
who to call.

951
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,039
This is state police,

952
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,399
military maybe.

953
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,606
What'd you find out?

954
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
You're right, okay?

955
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,919
I found something.

956
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,331
What? Well, what'd you
find out, Freddy?

957
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:40,401
You're out of here.

958
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,841
What'd you find out?

959
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,288
I found these behind
the dumpster.

960
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,011
This isn't a coincidence.

961
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,123
What's going on, fellas?

962
00:58:55,124 --> 00:58:56,884
Oh, I'm just talking to Roy.

963
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,201
How's it going, buddy?

964
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,039
Hey, man.
I got you....

965
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,724
one of your favorite sandwiches.

966
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,171
Sorry about having to
slip it through the bar.

967
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:10,970
Roast beef, no Swiss
cheese, pickle,

968
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,808
a little bit of mayo and a
cookie cola to wash it down.

969
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,922
Probably haven't had
one in a long time.

970
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,481
You don't wanna
eat that all, do you?

971
00:59:20,482 --> 00:59:22,125
Take it easy there, big boy.

972
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:23,406
He eats in his own time.

973
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,410
You know, Roy...

974
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,290
it's a good thing folks
around here still like you.

975
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,770
I just spoke with Suzie and...

976
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,846
her and Kenny aren't
going to press charges.

977
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,963
Now, I gotta tell you something,

978
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:45,849
you're really around here.

979
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,679
Nowadays,

980
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,001
you're just scaring the
hell out of everyone.

981
00:59:51,002 --> 00:59:54,288
All this talk about
townsfolk killing soldiers.

982
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,411
It's like yelling "fire"
in a crowded movie theater.

983
00:59:57,412 --> 00:59:58,959
You just don't do that.

984
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,088
You don't put the people
in a panic frenzy.

985
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,520
I know.

986
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,324
What the hell's going on, son?

987
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,003
Sheriff, I think you...

988
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,889
You just hold on there, Freddy.

989
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,366
I'm trying to talk to Roy.

990
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,839
I wish I could say I
understand you Roy,

991
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,840
but I don't.

992
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,199
But I want to tell you this.

993
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,770
You need to get your
shit together, son,

994
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:25,922
and be able to stand
back up on your feet.

995
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,840
You're right.

996
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,164
I think I have just been tired.

997
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,730
I was wrong for my actions.

998
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,845
I need to clean up my act.

999
01:00:36,846 --> 01:00:39,283
Roy? Roy,
what are you doing?

1000
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:41,044
What do you mean
about that, Deputy?

1001
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,964
You got something on your mind?

1002
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,965
Sheriff, Roy was correct.

1003
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,885
I checked into what he said.

1004
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,081
Well, Roy just told me he was

1005
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,365
fabricating a whole story,
now it happened?

1006
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,359
Freddy, it's okay.

1007
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,725
I just need rest.

1008
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,199
Okay? I've been tired.

1009
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,247
I'm tired.

1010
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,280
He can handle this.

1011
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,840
Well, somebody better
start talking plain here.

1012
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,360
I found these.

1013
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,400
My, my.

1014
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,884
Lordy, Lordy. I sure wish you
hadn't done that, Freddy.

1015
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,921
What just happened?

1016
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,685
Hey, put the gun down.

1017
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,124
You go downstairs
and lock the door.

1018
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,925
What just happened?

1019
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,886
What just happened?

1020
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,727
What just happened
is a sacrifice

1021
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,401
in a cause that is long overdue.

1022
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,690
What?
What are you talking about?

1023
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,405
This was not my intention,

1024
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,201
but it is a necessary evil

1025
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,119
in the execution of
our great revolution.

1026
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,765
Dude, you're not
making any sense.

1027
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:20,003
Oh, I'm making more sense than
anybody has in a long time.

1028
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,206
God...

1029
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,485
It's time for America
to rise from the ashes.

1030
01:02:26,486 --> 01:02:27,719
Are you out of your mind?

1031
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,767
Are you even...

1032
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,164
The day has finally come when
justice shall be served,

1033
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,681
and the new and greater America

1034
01:02:35,682 --> 01:02:37,086
will rise from the ashes.

1035
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,764
Seriously,
are you out of your mind!?

1036
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,482
No, I've never known
greater clarity.

1037
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,490
And you served this country,

1038
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,999
and so did I.

1039
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,079
I have held good American boys

1040
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,959
in my arms and watched them die,

1041
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,961
and for what?

1042
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,649
To serve the whims and the
financial interest of gutless,

1043
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,079
greedy politicians.

1044
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,959
Politicians who would
pick the pockets

1045
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,323
of all good Americans,

1046
01:03:00,324 --> 01:03:03,162
while they fill their
own coffers with gold,

1047
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:04,842
earned by the blood
of better men.

1048
01:03:04,843 --> 01:03:07,286
So are you telling me
you just killed Freddy,

1049
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,519
and Grant, and the others,

1050
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,170
because you're pissed
off at the government?

1051
01:03:11,171 --> 01:03:12,844
You are not listening
to me, Roy.

1052
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,519
Deputy Parks had to die

1053
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,285
because he could never
be a part of this cause.

1054
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,723
And before this night is over,
many will perish.

1055
01:03:21,724 --> 01:03:23,799
Scores will fall,

1056
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,479
friends and family

1057
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,529
will be sacrificed for a
greater, noble cause.

1058
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:31,959
So, you just killed
innocent soldiers

1059
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,769
to prove a freaking point?

1060
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,610
There are no innocents!

1061
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,169
Military or civilian,

1062
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,519
the day has finally come

1063
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,359
for all good Americans
to take up a rifle

1064
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:48,199
and fight for this cause
or die in its wake.

1065
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,202
Blood will run
through the streets

1066
01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:52,201
and the valleys of this nation

1067
01:03:52,202 --> 01:03:54,282
so that this country
can be free again.

1068
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,165
Listen to me Roy,

1069
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,882
I want you to be a
part of us, Roy.

1070
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,279
I want you to sit down

1071
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,691
and I want you to
think about what I'm saying

1072
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:05,045
to you, son.

1073
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,087
They have done you wrong.

1074
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,330
There's a greater goal
and there's a greater reason.

1075
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,841
You're out of your mind.

1076
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,291
<i>TVNN is warning the
nature of this video</i>

1077
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,519
<i>is intended for mature audiences</i>

1078
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,284
<i>due to the horrific execution</i>

1079
01:04:25,285 --> 01:04:27,399
<i>of 12 American hostages</i>

1080
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,801
<i>being tortured and
finally killed.</i>

1081
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,887
So tell me again what happened.

1082
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,531
I would like you to be part
of our fight, brother.

1083
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,120
You...

1084
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,161
you were a Special
Forces lieutenant.

1085
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,771
You took the oath.

1086
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,641
You served this
country with honor

1087
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:56,130
and distinction,

1088
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,965
and what did they do for you?

1089
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,721
Nothing.

1090
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,249
On the day that you were
supposed to be discharged,

1091
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,286
they told you what? You don't
have a home to go back to.

1092
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,999
It was all swept
away by a tornado,

1093
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,604
and your pregnant wife,

1094
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,405
and your children,

1095
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,279
and even your parents

1096
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,962
who happened to
be there visiting

1097
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:24,327
on the day of the terrible
tragedy were all killed.

1098
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,521
That callous and heartless
decision took a piece

1099
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,443
of your soul away that
you will never get back.

1100
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,884
You come and you be a
member of my family, Roy,

1101
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,003
a family that will
take back this nation

1102
01:05:43,004 --> 01:05:44,684
from the filthy ideologues

1103
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,399
that sit on both
sides of the table

1104
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,687
and give it back
to we the people.

1105
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:51,519
So you and Stacks

1106
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,440
think you're going to go
up against this country?

1107
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,925
Dude, you're insane.

1108
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,163
- You're insane.
- We're not alone.

1109
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,089
There are thousands
just like us,

1110
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,839
trained and eager to
fight upon my word.

1111
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,444
You know, it's a
little late to rewrite

1112
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:08,799
the constitution.

1113
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,484
Thomas Jefferson said

1114
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,364
that when a government can
no longer serve its people,

1115
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:17,602
then it is the duty of its
citizen to rise and revolt,

1116
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:18,840
and that we shall so.

1117
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,960
As we speak...

1118
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,764
tonight the Great North
Carolina will deploy

1119
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,879
and sail right into Washington

1120
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,848
and lay siege upon the capital.

1121
01:06:31,849 --> 01:06:32,887
This is real.

1122
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,566
Dang it

1123
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,885
We need to do something.

1124
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,681
Let's go get ROY-

1125
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,885
Oh, so you think you
can just, what,

1126
01:06:42,886 --> 01:06:45,041
steal an old battleship
and go unnoticed,

1127
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,563
just sail up there like that?

1128
01:06:46,564 --> 01:06:48,528
You forgot what
country you live in.

1129
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,041
Oh, what? Everyone
thinks I'm crazy

1130
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:53,690
because I chose to
live off the grid?

1131
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,528
Sir, you are bat shit crazy.

1132
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,042
It's a new system,

1133
01:06:59,043 --> 01:07:01,202
a new government;
from the people, for the people.

1134
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,328
We're going to be
heroes to the people.

1135
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,681
No, you ain't no hero, man.
You're a punk.

1136
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,681
Goddamn terrorists
breathing free air,

1137
01:07:10,682 --> 01:07:13,206
the freedom that our brothers
of arms defend for you.

1138
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,965
You're a bunch of
sadistic traitor asses.

1139
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,679
Yeah, it's truly what
you should your army.

1140
01:07:21,646 --> 01:07:22,646
Traitors.

1141
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,163
You know, I would have
more respect for you

1142
01:07:26,164 --> 01:07:28,161
if you crossed the
border and joined some

1143
01:07:28,162 --> 01:07:29,603
other radical group and

1144
01:07:29,604 --> 01:07:31,921
jumped on the hate
everyone bandwagon.

1145
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,445
But planning something like this

1146
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,171
on your own land
against your own people,

1147
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,884
taking innocent lives
because you think worthy?

1148
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,320
Punk.

1149
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,887
You're a punk.

1150
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,330
You have a lot of heart, Roy.

1151
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,966
And I would've loved that
you join us in this fight.

1152
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,845
But I suppose it's best that
you die with the others

1153
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,762
so that this great
country may be reborn.

1154
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,806
They heard the gunshot.
They want to speak to you.

1155
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,963
Prepare to meet your maker, son.

1156
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,766
Fuck!

1157
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,441
Alright, folks, listen up.
Everything is fine.

1158
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,685
One of our deputies discharged

1159
01:08:48,686 --> 01:08:50,123
his weapon. Nobody's hurt.

1160
01:08:50,124 --> 01:08:51,685
<i>But I saw Suzie</i>

1161
01:08:51,686 --> 01:08:54,319
get attacked by someone
dressed <i>in black.</i>

1162
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,970
<i>And I heard</i> a
<i>gunshot from the diner</i>

1163
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,319
<i>and We. been
closed since noon.</i>

1164
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,399
<i>Look, I don't know what</i>

1165
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,686
<i>you saw, what you think you saw,</i>

1166
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,842
<i>but everything is
going to be alright.</i>

1167
01:09:03,843 --> 01:09:06,320
I want you all to go home
and <i>stay</i> home.

1168
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,603
<i>Come morning, everything's</i>

1169
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:09,681
<i>going to be fine,</i>

1170
01:09:09,682 --> 01:09:10,806
<i>alright? Now get.</i>

1171
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,960
Go on, <i>get.</i>

1172
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,440
GO, get in!

1173
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,681
Yeah, I got good
memories when I was a kid,

1174
01:09:43,682 --> 01:09:45,887
you know, going camping,
playing stickball.

1175
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,926
Was great times, man.

1176
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,759
Tennis ball or handball?

1177
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,039
Handball, man.

1178
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,004
We used to bat... baseball bat.

1179
01:09:54,005 --> 01:09:55,523
It was sewer play to sewer play.

1180
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,362
It was your home run, you know?

1181
01:09:57,363 --> 01:09:58,999
And we always
challenged all the kids

1182
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,126
from the neighborhood, you know?

1183
01:10:00,127 --> 01:10:02,399
It was the Boyle
boys versus all.

1184
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,879
I don't get it,

1185
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,244
you guys and your
freaking stickball dude.

1186
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:08,368
It seemed like a different
world back then.

1187
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,559
Yeah, man.

1188
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,039
I got great memories.

1189
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,639
Uh, you know, my...

1190
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,483
I remember when my brother
came home from leave,

1191
01:10:17,484 --> 01:10:19,209
go out there in the living room,

1192
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,159
hang out on the carpet

1193
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,969
and we'd play with those
little green army men.

1194
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,689
It was the coolest time ever.

1195
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,325
- I'll never forget it.
- Yeah.

1196
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,639
I miss him.

1197
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,239
It was really awesome.

1198
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,447
I mean, I got some wonderful
memories up here.

1199
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,039
I bet you did.

1200
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,925
You kept in touch with
the boys, any at all,

1201
01:10:37,926 --> 01:10:39,279
since you've been back?

1202
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,280
My brothers?

1203
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,959
One I think lives near
Portland, Oregon,

1204
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,406
and the other one...

1205
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,645
somewhere in
New York last I heard.

1206
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,440
How about you?

1207
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,920
You know that.

1208
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,482
Cassandra was three years old,
Amanda left us.

1209
01:11:04,483 --> 01:11:07,689
Yeah. I know,
but I mean, what happened?

1210
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,161
It's tough.
It's tough.

1211
01:11:13,162 --> 01:11:15,128
When Cassandra was born,

1212
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,640
Amanda was...

1213
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,843
she was hooked on drugs, man.

1214
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,999
It was really tough.

1215
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,639
I mean, when you...

1216
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,679
when you find out your
spouse is cheating on you...

1217
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,884
everything goes south
really quick, man.

1218
01:11:32,885 --> 01:11:35,403
It-it turns everything
completely upside down.

1219
01:11:35,404 --> 01:11:37,082
She took a trip
to New York City,

1220
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:38,842
hang out with a friend of hers,

1221
01:11:38,843 --> 01:11:40,285
hooked up with this thug, man.

1222
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,761
I mean, to say irresponsible
would be a...

1223
01:11:45,762 --> 01:11:47,489
would be a fucking
understatement.

1224
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,650
I mean, she turned her back
on her family.

1225
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,881
You know how tough it is
being a single parent?

1226
01:11:53,882 --> 01:11:55,245
You know how tough it is

1227
01:11:55,246 --> 01:11:58,679
being me
and raising a little girl?

1228
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,444
You got a great
little girl, man.

1229
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,759
I got a good girl,
that girl over there.

1230
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,760
She's my angel.

1231
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,366
Here you go, uncle Roy.

1232
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,010
I cut off the ends
like you like.

1233
01:12:11,011 --> 01:12:12,411
Oh man...

1234
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,921
thank you.

1235
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
Thank you.

1236
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,806
Look at you.

1237
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:18,881
She's my angel.

1238
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,119
You say you got a plan.
Let's hear it.

1239
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,120
I got a plan.

1240
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,363
For damn sure I've got a plan.

1241
01:12:26,364 --> 01:12:28,169
You know,
my job has got its perks.

1242
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,286
Okay?

1243
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,879
I make the rounds.

1244
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,844
And through making the rounds,

1245
01:12:32,845 --> 01:12:35,406
I can figure out who has
got the same likes as I do

1246
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:36,845
or the same dislikes as I do.

1247
01:12:36,846 --> 01:12:38,399
In fact, this Chester,

1248
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,082
he must have an
armament over there.

1249
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:41,809
Each month,
he gets a new toy in.

1250
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,405
Okay, but what
good does that do,

1251
01:12:45,406 --> 01:12:47,524
as if they're meeting
on Chester's land?

1252
01:12:47,525 --> 01:12:50,126
We don't even know if Chester's
down with this or not.

1253
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,164
Oh, because Chester's a brother,

1254
01:12:52,165 --> 01:12:53,839
he must be down with it.

1255
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,205
Okay, here's a newsflash.

1256
01:12:55,206 --> 01:12:57,119
Sheriff White McWhiteMan

1257
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,043
turned out to be the
head devil in charge.

1258
01:12:59,044 --> 01:13:01,719
So, maybe the brother is clean.

1259
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,799
Chester keeps his guns
in a shop in the back

1260
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,040
in this cabinet.

1261
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,561
I mean, one time I took
cover from the rain.

1262
01:13:08,562 --> 01:13:10,445
I saw it there.
It's easy to get into.

1263
01:13:10,446 --> 01:13:11,601
He's got an arsenal, man.

1264
01:13:11,602 --> 01:13:13,199
That's an asset.

1265
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,087
Okay, but what about
the battleship?

1266
01:13:14,088 --> 01:13:15,161
Yeah, what about that?

1267
01:13:15,162 --> 01:13:16,162
Battleship?

1268
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,971
Okay guys, here's the plan.

1269
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,283
Ship's here, okay?
We go in.

1270
01:13:23,284 --> 01:13:25,324
We take out the power
supply instantly.

1271
01:13:25,325 --> 01:13:27,242
It's an old ship.
Everything shuts down.

1272
01:13:27,243 --> 01:13:29,284
Okay? Clear the ship
from bottom to top.

1273
01:13:29,285 --> 01:13:30,845
- Okay.
- That's the plan.

1274
01:13:30,846 --> 01:13:32,725
Right now,
the most important damn thing,

1275
01:13:32,726 --> 01:13:35,403
everybody get their ass
in gear, get out of here,

1276
01:13:35,404 --> 01:13:38,039
grab everything you need and
be back within two hours.

1277
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,040
Alright.

1278
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,760
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

1279
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,850
For the love of country.

1280
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,881
Shit.

1281
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,806
Holy shit.

1282
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,681
- You know I'll be back.
- I know that, dad.

1283
01:14:40,682 --> 01:14:42,284
- I love you.
- I love you more.

1284
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,879
Hey baby...

1285
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,291
make sure you call uncle Eddie.

1286
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,011
<i>Hello?
This is Commander Bower.</i>

1287
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,879
<i>Hi uncle Eddie.</i>

1288
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,880
<i>Cassandra?</i>

1289
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,840
<i>Hold on.
TJ's going where?</i>

1290
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,680
<i>Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sending a recon team.</i>

1291
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,320
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1292
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,891
Becca, take the over watch.

1293
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,080
Follow the breach, TJ.

1294
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,603
Did you bring ball cutters?

1295
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:16,119
Fuck no, didn't bring them.

1296
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,320
Fuck.
Do your thing, bro.

1297
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Go, go, go!

1298
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,883
Go, go!
GO, g0, go! GO!

1299
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,680
Move!

1300
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,161
Go go go go!

1301
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,200
Fuck!

1302
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:36,886
James Dean was the man.

1303
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,239
Everything he did was cool.

1304
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,725
The way he walked was cool.

1305
01:20:42,726 --> 01:20:43,960
The way he talked was cool.

1306
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,562
The way he smoked too,
it was the coolest.

1307
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,525
Can you imagine James Dean

1308
01:20:56,526 --> 01:20:58,199
smoking one of these
fucking things?

1309
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,560
Absolutely no cool factor,

1310
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,490
you know what I'm saying?

1311
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,163
You must be...
Roy Boyle, right?

1312
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,285
Well, this is a good day.

1313
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,922
I was hoping I'd get a
chance to meet you.

1314
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,561
Say you used to be
something back in the day.

1315
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,006
I mean, personally...

1316
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,687
no offense,

1317
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,250
but I just don't see it, man.

1318
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:26,366
Alright, man.

1319
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,881
Let's do this thing.

1320
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,890
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

1321
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,480
Hey!

1322
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,680
Rebecca and Kenny
cleaned the lower deck.

1323
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,246
Upper deck's clear.

1324
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,846
Corner deck's clear, man.

1325
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,890
Thanks for being here for me.

1326
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,166
You good?

1327
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,600
I'm good.

1328
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,159
You good?

1329
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,805
I'm good.
I'll be alright.

1330
01:24:14,806 --> 01:24:16,924
Alright, I'm gonna have
Kenny and Becca.

1331
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:19,044
Meet us at 0400 hours
at checkpoint.

1332
01:24:19,045 --> 01:24:21,042
- 0400 checkpoint, got you.
- You got it?

1333
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,641
- Yeah.
- Right there.

1334
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,923
Let's finish this
thing, goddamnit.

1335
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:08,926
Thomas?

1336
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,319
What's up, man?
Who are all these people?

1337
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,843
What are you doing with
all these equipment, man?

1338
01:25:12,844 --> 01:25:13,844
What's that about?

1339
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,286
I'm sorry for everything.

1340
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,480
I'm so sorry.

1341
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,406
Alright, secure the perimeter!

1342
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,164
I don't want anybody
getting in or out!

1343
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:30,889
I want this completely
locked down!

1344
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,521
We have 18 hours to
get to checkpoint B

1345
01:25:36,522 --> 01:25:39,043
in Virginia if that map Larry
put together is correct.

1346
01:25:39,044 --> 01:25:40,679
What about the North Carolina?

1347
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,330
Boat's about 80 miles
an hour and on point.

1348
01:25:42,331 --> 01:25:45,210
No, it's not a boat,
it's a battleship,

1349
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,799
alright?

1350
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,243
Who is our contact in Virginia?

1351
01:25:48,244 --> 01:25:50,561
Malloy.
James Malloy, 1st Cavalry.

1352
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,003
I know Malloy. It's good
to know you're friends.

1353
01:25:53,004 --> 01:25:54,490
You better know your enemies.

1354
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,520
Let's go!

1355
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,241
What in the fuck
have we got into?

1356
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,445
I don't know what the
fuck we got into,

1357
01:26:08,446 --> 01:26:10,408
but I know how the hell
we're getting out of it.

1358
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:11,999
I got left flank.

1359
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,922
Alright, I'll get to them.
Get to them.

1360
01:26:13,923 --> 01:26:14,923
Well, let's do this.

1361
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,079
Right up, guys.
You stay close,

1362
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,525
this is going down now.

1363
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,280
Contact!

1364
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,839
My ass.

1365
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,639
You're both my bitches.

1366
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,520
- Oh, you're back now, huh?
- Come on, let's go!

1367
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:41,881
Cover us, girl.

1368
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,770
Reckon you're gonna drop that
weapon you little hussy.

1369
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,481
You fucking traitor.

1370
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,767
Come on.
Come on!

1371
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,769
Who are you?
Are you one of them?

1372
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,286
I'm a soldier.

1373
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,488
Alright, you got a lot
of bleeding here.

1374
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,799
I'll be back.

1375
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,640
Kenny!

1376
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,680
Kenny!

1377
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,759
<i>This is Bishop-36.</i>

1378
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,603
<i>- Be advised.
- Be advised up.</i>

1379
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:43,960
They're behind us!

1380
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,887
Agh!

1381
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,120
Agh!

1382
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,890
Friends killing
friends for what?

1383
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,764
I forgive you, Thomas.

1384
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:05,920

1387
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,851
Go to home, my brother.

1388
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,971
