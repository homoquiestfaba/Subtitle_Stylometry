00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,724
- Jump high on water, please

2
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:35,875
Come on

3
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,125
Jump higher!

4
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:45,917
Jump!

00:00:50,173 --> 00:00:57,071
[chattering]

6
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,292
- Hmm...

7
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:57,664
You're only supposed to... being here for fifteen minutes

8
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:12,333
- Swear God! Health Inspectors get younger every year!

9
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,542
- What?

10
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:18,469
- You want those kid playing their game?

11
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,833
- Yeah

12
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,464
- What is that?

13
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:24,167
- Hmm...water polo

14
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,633
- What the hell is water polo?

15
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:29,477
- It's a sport

16
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:33,250
- Are you good at it?

17
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,719
- No, not really. I mean

18
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,456
my dad is paying for the camp, so I have to go.

19
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:49,292
[sighing]

20
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:29,579
[chattering]

21
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:51,583
[chattering]

22
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:35,083
- Hey!

23
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:38,542
Your parents are paying these people

24
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,544
and they put you on the bench?

25
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,375
- Thanks

26
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:48,625
Ankle seems fine...

27
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,417
- Oh, yeah.

28
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,498
It did recover quick.

29
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:57,458
What?

30
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,340
- Which is the wise

31
00:06:00,537 --> 00:06:02,042
And this comes from a man who

32
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:05,150
didn't learn to embrace athletic endeavors

33
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:07,875
until his collapsed role level gave him no choice.

34
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:09,917
- Yeah...

35
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:13,289
- Time moves the all lot faster

36
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,542
when you actually try.

37
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:53,958
- Hmmm...

38
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,180
Hmmm...I was wondering if I could play goalie today?

39
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:05,125
- Okay

40
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,958
- Hey!

41
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,542
Hey!
