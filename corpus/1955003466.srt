1
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:17,561
Are you okay?

2
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,892
Miss!

3
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:32,135
Miss.

4
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:42,345
Where are you going?

5
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:45,115
Wherever you can take us.

6
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,784
The usual.

7
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:48,851
It'd be a pleasure, Miss...

8
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:50,362
Miss Hannah.

9
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,557
Good to meet you, Miss Hannah.

10
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,661
You should get in the car.

11
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:57,465
Yeah?

12
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:01,936
If you want a ride.

13
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:04,833
Hey, we really appreciate this.

14
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:07,312
So, do you have a name?

15
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:13,151
Uh, yeah. Max.

16
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,246
Well, Maxy...

17
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:18,314
You got a nice car.

18
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,588
You're sweet.

19
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:27,800
Hey, I think we're ready.

20
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:31,463
Do you mind if I check my ride?
I don't wanna forget my toothbrush.

21
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:35,599
Just hurry it up.
I don't wanna roast out here. It's burning.

22
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,816
Dibs.

23
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:50,584
- Bullshit.
- Come on. It's my turn.

24
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:53,558
I reeled him in. He's my fish to fry.

25
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:55,288
Semantics.

26
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:57,824
Big word.

27
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,225
Rock, paper, scissors.

28
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:04,099
What, are we seven?

29
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:08,773
You have to get used to it
if you want a kid around.

30
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:10,400
Right?

31
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:23,446
- I win.
- I guess you do.

32
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:36,368
Are you serious about that kid?

33
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:43,739
Hammer-time serious.

34
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:47,970
You can light the next one up, babe.

35
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:49,948
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

36
00:03:57,556 --> 00:04:00,424
Shit. That's a hell
of a long time for a toothbrush.

37
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:02,792
- I needed my floss too.
- Yeah?

38
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:04,888
Well, some say that's more important.

39
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:09,331
You're gonna have to get in the back, man.
Sorry.

40
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:12,395
Step out of the car.

41
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:15,066
- Huh?
- Step out of the car, Maxy.

42
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:17,474
- What the fuck is this?
- Dude.

43
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:20,103
Don't panic. Happens to the best of us.

44
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:22,444
- And the worst.
- And the worst.

45
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:26,276
Get the fuck out of my car right now.
What the...

46
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:43,291
Hey, babe?

47
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:46,764
I was thinking about, like, drugs and that.

48
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:50,325
Like how people
will classify something a drug...

49
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:53,861
and stamp it with this negativity.

50
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:02,338
You know, like weed.

51
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:05,714
Like, all this negativity
for something so happy.

52
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:11,487
But then I got to thinking, like...

53
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:13,526
can't anything be a drug?

54
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:15,527
You know? Like water. Okay?

55
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:17,290
Water's a drug. Seriously.

56
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:19,423
You go cold turkey on water...

57
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:22,491
your throat swells up, you hallucinate...

58
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:25,732
get the shakes and, like, die.

59
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:31,207
That's a worse relapse
than I've seen a heroin junkie get.

60
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:34,372
Where's the warning label
on a bottle of water? Huh? Huh?

61
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:36,142
"May get addicted.

62
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:39,208
Side effects... drowning and dizziness."

63
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:43,149
What do you think?

64
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,618
Babe.

65
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,563
Hey.

66
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,333
How you doing?

67
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:07,743
- I'm...
- Awful.

68
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:10,339
Dainty. Empathetic.

69
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,314
I'm terrific.

70
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:16,582
Good.

71
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,647
'Cause you're my drug.

72
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:29,561
Mrs. Hannah West.

73
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,363
You can't do this, Jake.

74
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:02,924
I-I'm only doing what you can't.

75
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,335
Don't. I'll talk to him.
I'll make him stop.

76
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:36,827
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

77
00:08:36,902 --> 00:08:40,134
- You look afraid.
- What would I have to be afraid of?

78
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:43,141
- There comes a time in every man's life...
- Holy shit. You know what?

79
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,770
I'm gonna pass on the Tumblr life advice.
This guy? He's a real keeper.

80
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:54,851
- Please.
- What do you want me to do?

81
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,479
Do something!

82
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,524
Stop him!

83
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:01,753
No!

84
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:08,798
If you were smart, you'd leave too.

85
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:17,766
Hey, you ready?

86
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:20,709
Yeah?

87
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,451
What?

88
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:28,112
- I-I need my paintbrush.
- Paintbrush.

89
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:32,250
- I'll buy you new ones, okay?
- Okay.

90
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,703
Michael!

91
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:35,676
You look like an absolute mess.

92
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:39,377
- What's going on in here?
- I-I... I slept too late.

93
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:43,115
Just in time for <i>Passions,</i> huh?

94
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:45,623
- You okay?
- Yeah.

95
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,560
Okay, then. Did you remember to...

96
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,118
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Um...

97
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,221
- What?
- Nothing.

98
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:55,028
What's going on in here?
Is there somebody else here?

99
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,569
Whoa! No. Why would you
automatically think that?

100
00:11:57,636 --> 00:11:59,502
- You're hiding something.
- No.

101
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:01,335
Just... Just calm down.

102
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,843
I don't get why you're acting so weird.

103
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,403
I'm sorry.

104
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,315
I... I just had a rough day at work today.
We had to let Eric go.

105
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,853
Eric? Come here.

106
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,254
- What the hell is...
- G-Give me that!

107
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:29,227
Is this a suicide note?

108
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,826
I can explain.

109
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:32,838
Don't you think you're overreacting?

110
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:35,306
No. I-I'm reacting just fine, I-I think.

111
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:38,310
You think? You just thinkin'
you're gonna kill yourself?

112
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,442
And I don't snore.

113
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:51,682

looking at me. - Who?

119
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:15,173
The clerk.

120
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:21,185
- You don't like how anyone looks at you.
- Yeah, so stop it.

121
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:25,186
- Repeat after me.
- Repeat after me.

122
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:30,561
I will never look at Hannah again.

123
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:35,465
- I will never look at my wife ever again.
- Exact words, asshole!

124
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,526
Or it doesn't count.

125
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,336
I've failed you.

126
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,898
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-mmm.

127
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,536
No? Mmm.

128
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,807
There's a motel down the road.

129
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:55,684
It's an okay place.
That's where the whores usually go.

130
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:57,746
Not my gas station.

131
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:05,386
Wow. Aren't you just
the funniest piece of shit.

132
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,471
Twice the size, half the respect.

133
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,408
We expect an apology.

134
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:23,040
The only thing you should be expecting is
to get blown into bits of fuckin' beef.

135
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:27,850
There's a lady present.

136
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,783
I know that car!

137
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:36,962
I know that's not your car...

138
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:39,931
and I know the man
that would never part with it.

139
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,700
Well, you don't have to be
such a prick about it.

140
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,035
Please, no!

141
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:51,542
Twenty on two.

142
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:08,118
You should've killed him.

143
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:10,856
Yeah, I know.

144
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:14,493
But it's your turn.

145
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:55,606
That's the hardest one you've got, Betty?
Come on. Challenge me.

146
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:57,267
I don't know.

147
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:59,971
You were doing fine earlier.
Just ask another one. Make it harder.

148
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:02,674
- I hate when you do that.
- When I do what?

149
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:07,015
You ask me to tell a joke,
or tell a story, or ask a question.

150
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:09,748
I hate the pressure.

151
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:13,258
Okay, no jokes, stories and questions.

152
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:15,157
That's not the point.

153
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,488
- Give me a second.
- Fine.

154
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:26,762
Anytime now.

155
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,768
Okay. Who was the only person Van Gogh
ever sold a painting to?

156
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:33,334
Really?

157
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:34,903
- You know I hate him.
- You asked.

158
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,111
He can Van Gogh fuck himself.

159
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:41,881
Uh, can I get the painting name?

160
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:44,115
<i>Red Vineyard at Arles.</i>

161
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:48,058
Okay.
Um, can you use it in a sentence?

162
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:52,923
Uh, was it, uh, Luke?

163
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:56,426
- No.
- Right. Just fuck patrons.

164
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:58,436
Um...

165
00:16:58,503 --> 00:17:00,369
I don't know. I give up.

166
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,408
His brother.

167
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:04,409
Fuck that.

168
00:17:04,476 --> 00:17:06,968
Dude had less logic than he did ears.

169
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:15,115
Jon.

170
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:16,678
I like Hazel.

171
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:18,451
I like Terry.

172
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:19,855
Fuck Terry.

173
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:22,121
- Seriously. Terry's a good name.
- So is Luke.

174
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:24,789
No, Luke sounds way too much like "puke."

175
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:27,263
Babies vomit.

176
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:31,261
They also piss.

177
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:34,431
And if it's a girl,
she'll be bleeding soon enough.

178
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:38,576
I'm just happy to be alone with you.

179
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,717
Then why are you slowing down?

180
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:48,379
West, why are you slowing down?

181
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:51,787
I'm not gonna be rude. They look nice.
They can't be going too far.

182
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:55,419
- Do you know what irony is?
- I'm not inviting them to search the trunk.

183
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:57,156
All right?

184
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:05,466
Hey.

185
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,062
Hi, guys. Thank you for stopping.

186
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:09,437
No problem. Where y'all headed?

187
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:14,970
Uh, next town? Anywhere with fuckin'
shade in a box, honestly.

188
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:17,379
Uh, we don't got a ton of room.

189
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:21,580
Well, we got, like, no stuff.
Just me, Betty, two packs.

190
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:26,149
- Yeah, man, hop right in. Come on.
It's a hot day. - Thank you.

191
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:12,460
So, what's your two's deal?

192
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:14,962
Newlyweds, man.

193
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,101
Whoa. Congrats, man. That's really big.

194
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:20,771
No, man, amazing is what it is.

195
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:24,407
Yeah, we formed a band
a few years back, you know.

196
00:19:24,482 --> 00:19:27,418
I was smitten.
She thought I was a lazy asshole.

197
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:29,647
You know?

198
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:31,849
But, uh, not much has changed...

199
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,858
except for the whole love thing.

200
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:35,416
Yeah.

201
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,984
More power to you, man.

202
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:38,621
All the joy.

203
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:42,125
How about a game of rock, paper, scissors?

204
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,431
So, what about you guys? What's your deal?

205
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:47,301
- Your partner's quite the talker.
- Oh, yeah. Betty.

206
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:50,831
She's pretty quiet,
but she's the smartest girl I know.

207
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:54,175
That's what I say, man.
Marry the most interesting chick you know.

208
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:56,771
- She ain't bad on the eyes either.
- Yeah.

209
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,150
So happy for you.

210
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,123
Guys, don't mind Hannah.
She's just a little salty I picked you up.

211
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:09,991
I mean, honestly, if we're imposing...

212
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:11,996
Dude, quit it. Seriously.

213
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:15,033
We're pulling into town now. Can't be
any worse off than that guy either.

214
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,035
- Oh, fuck!
- Dude.

215
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:20,266
Some broad probably ruined his day too.

216
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,208
Michael.

217
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:28,972
Michael.

218
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,107
Wake the fuck up.

219
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:33,879
Michael. Get off the lawn, please.

220
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:35,443
I wanna come inside.

221
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:39,155
I know.
I heard you yelling last night.

222
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:41,284
And you ignored me?

223
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,590
You're damn straight I did.

224
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:45,927
I can't be taking all this
up and down shit, Michael.

225
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:48,933
Do you even know what this is doing to me?

226
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,164
Well, call the cops. I don't care.

227
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,503
Very funny.

228
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:56,234
Here.

229
00:20:57,676 --> 00:20:59,406
What's this for?

230
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:04,247
You shit in the backyard
last night, Michael.

231
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:06,682
A-And you called it...

232
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,913
"liberating Liberace."

233
00:21:08,987 --> 00:21:12,446
- You love my humor.
- Not when it smells like spoiled Brie.

234
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:19,388
Listen.

235
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,303
I love you, Michael.

236
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:34,005
I love you too.

237
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,413
- Which is why...
- Uh, look, I-I'll... pull myself together.

238
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:39,849
Which is why I...

239
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:42,080
I don't think this is gonna work out.

240
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:44,315
You're obviously...

241
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:46,324
You're obviously
going through something.

242
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,826
Then let's sit down
and talk each other through it.

243
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:51,886
Help each other out, like good couples do.

244
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:55,094
I want to, but...

245
00:21:56,835 --> 00:22:00,067
I don't think you're ready for
a relationship right now.

246
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:01,902
And...

247
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:03,566
you drink a lot.

248
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:06,511
I mean, a <i>lot,</i> Michael.

249
00:22:06,578 --> 00:22:08,513
You fucking shit in the backyard!

250
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,139
Okay.

251
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:12,975
- Michael.
- I said okay.

252
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:15,780
Fuck.

253
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:19,519
What do you mean, there's no gig?

254
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:23,993
I'm... W-We don't have live music here.

255
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:27,897
I mean, we got a jukebox. Right there.

256
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:30,333
This has to be some cruel joke.

257
00:22:31,336 --> 00:22:34,067
The only reason that we are here...

258
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:36,768
instead of Hawaii
or some bullshit Alaskan cruise...

259
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:38,833
is the chance to play, right?

260
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:42,570
Right?

261
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:44,309
Yeah. Yeah, look.

262
00:22:44,382 --> 00:22:45,907
I mean, I called Cortland.

263
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:48,317
They said we could
play our music here on the 17th.

264
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:50,821
- That's tomorrow.
- Yeah.

265
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:56,094
I... I mean, this <i>is</i> Cortland Bar.

266
00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:03,401
But there's also, uh, Cortland Liquor,
which is the liquor shop...

267
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:08,304
and Cortland Thrift,
which is also... it's the thrift shop.

268
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:12,641
Uh, Cortland High, the high school...

269
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:17,440
The high school! The high school
is having their talent show.

270
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:19,809
Tomorrow night.

271
00:23:22,854 --> 00:23:24,846
You booked us...

272
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:27,518
a fucking high school
talent show?

273
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,158
Babe, I didn't...

274
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:34,165
A fucking high school talent show...

275
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:36,292
for our honeymoon.

276
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,233
Are you fucking retarded?

277
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:41,740
Hannah, I'm sorry.

278
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:44,207
Okay, look,
we don't have to go. All right?

279
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:46,608
We can still enjoy all of this. Right?

280
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:48,408
All of this.

281
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,277
Whatever this is.

282
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:53,375
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt, but do you
know a place we can stay for the night?

283
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:56,285
And you really shouldn't say "retard."
That's not cool.

284
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:59,620
Uh, we don't really have
hotels around here.

285
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:04,487
But there is a bed and breakfast
up the mountain a bit.

286
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:06,861
<i>♪ Sober night ♪</i>

287
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,797
Great. Uh, how do we get there?

288
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:18,867
Looks like we'll be riding with you
a little bit longer.

289
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,880
You guys are really gonna like this place.
It's really, really nice.

290
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:34,115
So, you're gonna head up this way
about two miles...

291
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:36,354
you take a left on Shitstain Road.

292
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:42,725
And at the end is the B and B
just past the lake.

293
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,167
You guys have a road called Shitstain?

294
00:24:45,236 --> 00:24:47,034
Yeah, it doesn't really have a name.

295
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:51,338
But it's all dirt and it looks like shit,
so... Yeah.

296
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:54,512
Wonderful.

297
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,980
Let's go get shitty.

298
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:01,646
- Thanks for your help.
- Take it easy.

299
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,950
Hey, champ.

300
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:26,208
All right.

301
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:29,076
Yeah. Okay.

302
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:32,473
Turn over.

303
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,385
- Why?
- Do what I say, you fuckin' slut.

304
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:43,551
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you fucking kidding me?

305
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:45,563
No fucking way.

306
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,360
No, no, no. Hold on.

307
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:49,264
Don't you want this?

308
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:51,269
All right, just...

309
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:52,929
Fine. Okay.

310
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:57,539
If I tap your ass, though,
I want it off. Okay?

311
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:59,907
It's not my ass gettin' tapped.

312
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:06,381
Shut up.

313
00:26:46,391 --> 00:26:48,121
Wow.

314
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:02,132
It's huge.

315
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:05,907
This is perfect.

316
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:08,640
- Right, babe?
- Delightful.

317
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,880
Come on. A little nature won't kill us.

318
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,851
Yeah?

319
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:16,911
We're also not gonna play a show.

320
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:18,923
So enjoy your fucking bed.

321
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,050
And breakfast.

322
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:35,166
Doesn't it look kind of
like the Custom House?

323
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,901
- What's that?
- Monet.

324
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:39,205
<i>Custom House, Morning Effect.</i>

325
00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:41,746
Hmm. A lot smaller than my house.

326
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:44,214
Also a lot more on a cliff.

327
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,085
But I do appreciate the comparison.

328
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,781
Hey, how many beds you need?

329
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:53,882
- Uh... two. Two should be good.
- Cool.

330
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,553
- Possibly a couch.
- No problem.

331
00:27:56,627 --> 00:27:59,096
I have room for everybody.

332
00:27:59,163 --> 00:28:01,394
Ah. You must be Rachael.

333
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,765
Yeah. Sorry.
I'm horrible with introductions.

334
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:07,169
- I am Rachael of Rachael's Bed
and Breakfast. - My pleasure.

335
00:28:07,238 --> 00:28:10,265
- Ah. You need help with your bags?
- No, we're fine.

336
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:14,840
Okay. Well, uh,
you can check in anytime you want.

337
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:17,677
Take whatever room on the bottom floor.
I'll be around.

338
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:20,240
Oh, the room on the right is taken.

339
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:21,877
- Another guest?
- Yeah. Long-term.

340
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:23,888
He doesn't bother anybody.

341
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:27,119
But if you see a tallish man
lurking around, don't be scared.

342
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:29,183
- Scared.
- Mmm.

343
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:32,729
Hey. What was that?

344
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:37,735
Miss Little Art History 101
in her high boots. What do you think?

345
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:40,738
- I think you're being uncool.
- Yeah?

346
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:43,468
Well,
I didn't pick Fucksville for a honeymoon.

347
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:54,545
Mm-hmm.

348
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:06,556
Okay.

349
00:29:07,832 --> 00:29:09,391
Okay.

350
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,305
This ain't too bad.

351
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:15,931
Huh?

352
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:20,509
Shit.

353
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:23,538
I forgot my toothbrush.

354
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:30,812
Hey.

355
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:33,818
You okay?

356
00:29:36,227 --> 00:29:38,696
What are we doing here?

357
00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:41,860
I miss home.

358
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:44,863
Okay.

359
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:47,799
Yeah, I mean, I do too.

360
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:49,807
But...

361
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:53,072
you know, there's...
there's bigger plans for us now.

362
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:54,942
Yeah?

363
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:57,914
I don't know if I can do this.

364
00:29:57,982 --> 00:29:59,644
You can, Betty.

365
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:07,691
I meant me and you on the road.

366
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:12,322
Well...

367
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,388
what are you emphasizing?

368
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,558
Me and you?

369
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:20,867
Or are you emphasizing us... on the road?

370
00:30:20,938 --> 00:30:23,430
Either. Both.

371
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:26,334
I d... I don't know.

372
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:32,807
You sh...

373
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:34,977
Here, why don't you...

374
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:38,250
Why don't you lie down for a second? Okay?

375
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:41,190
Let me go see what this place has got
in terms of food.

376
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,593
Hopefully something more
than juice and waffles. Okay?

377
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:05,046
May I help you?

378
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:07,449
No. I'm fine.

379
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:11,148
Hey, we might have gotten off
on the wrong foot earlier today.

380
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:14,158
But I'm just trying to make sure everybody
has a pleasurable stay.

381
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:17,753
I'll bet. Any means necessary.

382
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:19,319
Excuse me?

383
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:22,959
You look the type to run a brothel,
not a bed and breakfast.

384
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:25,026
What crawled up your cunt, bitch?

385
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:29,671
Hey, um...

386
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,005
I'm leading a tour of the woods
in the morning.

387
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:35,205
And if you wake up and decide to abort
your shitty attitude...

388
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,043
you're welcome to come.

389
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,619
Hey.

390
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,951
- Sorry. I-I didn't...
- Come here.

391
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:23,426
What were you doing?

392
00:32:23,494 --> 00:32:25,053
Nothing.

393
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:29,724
Why were you creeping? It's creepy.

394
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,261
You're really pretty.

395
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:43,310
You're pretty too.

396
00:32:57,762 --> 00:32:59,788
Do you want to talk?

397
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:03,928
Or sit?

398
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:13,768
My mother never brushed my hair.

399
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:17,178
I thought that was something
moms were supposed to do.

400
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:19,046
Count to a hundred.

401
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:23,179
Sing a lullaby.

402
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:26,588
Put the lotion in the basket. Nice stuff.

403
00:33:27,825 --> 00:33:30,488
I like it. Makes me feel like a cat.

404
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,865
You like animals then?

405
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,491
More than people.

406
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,798
I can understand that.

407
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,197
West is nice.

408
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,937
Yes.

409
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,877
Yes, he is.

410
00:33:50,981 --> 00:33:52,472
Do you... Ow!

411
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,451
Sorry.

412
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:56,510
Sorry. I'm not used to this.

413
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,094
Aren't there things you want to do
before becoming a mom?

414
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:09,460
Who said I was becoming a mom?

415
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:13,263
Sorry.

416
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:14,896
Theoretically.

417
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:18,700
You mean, like...

418
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:22,404
go to Europe?

419
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,743
That.

420
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:26,613
See museums. Meet new people.

421
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:28,550
I did a lot of that in school.

422
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,918
You're young. You have time.

423
00:34:37,595 --> 00:34:39,996
Evening, Rachael.
Sorry to bother you so late.

424
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:41,760
Yeah. Is everything okay?

425
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:44,801
Y-Yeah...

426
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:47,964
Well, uh, we've got
a couple kids gone missing.

427
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:49,973
Anyone I know?

428
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,976
A college girl and a bartender.

429
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:56,070
Throw in a priest, you got a good joke.

430
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:59,583
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't see
that you had friends over.

431
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,141
Patrons, yeah.

432
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:04,313
Okay, well, they can hear this too.

433
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:07,085
I'm gonna recommend that you don't go out
alone for a few nights.

434
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:09,092
We don't know where the kids went.

435
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:12,391
My money's that the two fools
just ran off together, but...

436
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:14,932
I'm not sheriff anymore, so...

437
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:17,969
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

438
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,971
You know, that's not the only reason
why I came up here.

439
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:24,475
- Are you still doing the Sunday hike?
- Yeah. Bright and early.

440
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:27,978
Well, good. I'll be there.

441
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:31,105
- Okay.
- Have a good night.

442
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,142
Good night.

443
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,781
Well, I'll see you all in the morning.

444
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:33,735
<i>Just cry. It's the natural way.</i>

445
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:36,679
<i>If you cry, you'll feel good.</i>

446
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:39,842
<i>If you feel good, you'll
accept who you are.</i>

447
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:44,878
<i>If you accept who you are,
maybe you won't have to cry anymore, pussy.</i>

448
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:50,622
<i>And so ends side "A" of</i> Help Me Help You
Stop Hating Yourself.

449
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:10,343
I'm sorry, babe.

450
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,402
Sorry if I offended some people
this afternoon.

451
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,868
Sorry I'm smoking on your porch.

452
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,742
It's cool.

453
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,151
That works.

454
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:36,292
So, uh, what do we do now?

455
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:40,293
What do you mean?

456
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,396
Like...

457
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:45,238
you know, all the small talk's over.

458
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:47,335
Chitchat.

459
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,076
What do we do?

460
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:56,382
We, like, enrich
each other's lives or something.

461
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:59,013
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

462
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,955
Uh, how do we do that?

463
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,597
Okay, say the first thing
that comes to your head.

464
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:13,336
Your guitar looks like a cock.

465
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:19,068
- Yeah? Okay.
- Mmm.

466
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:20,736
You go.

467
00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:32,186
Balloons look like boobs.

468
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:34,054
Okay?

469
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:36,650
And roses...

470
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:38,593
look like vaginas.

471
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,626
- Vagina!
- Yep. Yep.

472
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:44,190
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

473
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:46,533
- It's a great word. Right?
- It's a <i>great</i> word.

474
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:48,902
- Yeah.
- The best, actually.

475
00:39:49,773 --> 00:39:51,571
I...

476
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,415
Cool.

477
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,510
Are you coming on the walk tomorrow?

478
00:40:02,586 --> 00:40:04,953
Yeah.

479
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:06,547
Count me in.

480
00:40:06,623 --> 00:40:08,558
Cool. Oh...

481
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,825
Looking forward to it.

482
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:16,730
- Night.
- Yep.

483
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,826
All right.

484
00:40:44,394 --> 00:40:45,885
Hey, buddy.

485
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:27,487
Oh!

486
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,566
You're that other guy.

487
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:38,598
You're the creepy guy.

488
00:42:42,446 --> 00:42:44,381
You okay?

489
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:52,979
Motherfucker.

490
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:08,728
Marriage...

491
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:12,232
shouldn't be...

492
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:16,470
this fuckin' hard.

493
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,613
The fuck!

494
00:43:26,923 --> 00:43:27,923
What?

495
00:43:58,288 --> 00:44:00,314
Aaah!

496
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:40,993
Thank you.

497
00:44:41,064 --> 00:44:42,862
Anyone drink coffee?

498
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:50,771
Hey.

499
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:54,209
Uh, we're heading out soon, so...

500
00:44:56,346 --> 00:44:58,144
Are you okay?

501
00:44:58,215 --> 00:45:00,047
I'm fine.

502
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,785
Have you seen West?

503
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:07,654
So you're not fine. Uh, I don't know.

504
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:10,353
What if he left,
or ran away like those two assholes?

505
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:11,918
Hey.

506
00:45:15,398 --> 00:45:17,958
West seemed like a really capable guy.

507
00:45:21,037 --> 00:45:25,202
And considering his name, I think he's got
a pretty good sense of direction, so...

508
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:27,471
Fuck off.

509
00:45:27,544 --> 00:45:32,073
- Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- Did you hear me, asshole?

510
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:34,311
Well, I'm just saying.

511
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,519
Look, he probably went
to the bar last night.

512
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:43,583
You know, it's a long walk back.

513
00:45:46,196 --> 00:45:48,461
Why don't you come with us on the hike?

514
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:50,933
And we'll probably run into him.

515
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,936
Yeah?

516
00:45:54,771 --> 00:45:56,262
Okay. Fine.

517
00:45:57,474 --> 00:45:59,466
- Cool.
- Now leave.

518
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,193
Hmm.

519
00:46:30,774 --> 00:46:33,107
Want some jerky?

520
00:46:33,176 --> 00:46:35,202
I'm not gonna say no.

521
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:41,115
I don't touch the stuff myself.

522
00:46:41,184 --> 00:46:43,551
But I always have extra.

523
00:46:47,924 --> 00:46:49,722
Hey, Michael?

524
00:46:49,793 --> 00:46:53,025
- This isn't my first hike, but...
- Yeah, I know.

525
00:46:53,096 --> 00:46:55,224
It's my first.

526
00:46:55,298 --> 00:46:57,358
Yeah. You okay?

527
00:46:57,434 --> 00:47:00,427
Or are you trying to lose the Twinkie puff?

528
00:47:00,503 --> 00:47:04,270
- You insulting the law, girl?
- No. Never.

529
00:47:04,341 --> 00:47:07,277
I'm just saying, I'm a pretty good
seamstress if you need some new clothes.

530
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:08,835
Duly noted.

531
00:47:11,448 --> 00:47:14,885
So, how long have you
and West been together?

532
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:16,886
We started fucking in high school.

533
00:47:16,953 --> 00:47:19,320
Found a common interest. It stuck.

534
00:47:19,389 --> 00:47:21,688
So, that's romantic then.

535
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:24,421
You don't need romance when you have music.

536
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:28,257
What kind of band you in?

537
00:47:28,331 --> 00:47:30,664
We're called The Royal Cunts.

538
00:47:34,971 --> 00:47:36,963
So, what about you and Betty?

539
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,804
Not that I care.

540
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:42,107
Uh, we've known each other
since we were kids.

541
00:47:42,178 --> 00:47:44,170
One day it was a kiss, and then...

542
00:47:44,247 --> 00:47:46,648
Yeah, she's licking your asshole.

543
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:08,604
Is she all right?

544
00:48:08,672 --> 00:48:10,698
Uh, yeah. I think
the flu's going around or something.

545
00:48:10,774 --> 00:48:12,572
The flu. Right.

546
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:14,406
Hope it wasn't my cooking.

547
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:18,442
I'm fine, really.

548
00:48:18,515 --> 00:48:22,008
We made it to the lake.
Let's eat lunch here.

549
00:48:31,428 --> 00:48:34,557
I-I picked it up, Davie. I did.

550
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:51,308
This doesn't feel right.

551
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:56,483
We had a home.

552
00:48:57,854 --> 00:48:59,846
Baby, that wasn't a home.

553
00:49:02,225 --> 00:49:05,787
Hey. Now, who's been looking out for you?

554
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,095
- You.
- Yeah.

555
00:49:09,165 --> 00:49:11,327
Damn straight.

556
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:17,804
Hey.

557
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:19,934
We're gonna be okay.

558
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:22,706
We are.

559
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:27,679
Just gonna be me, you and our kid.

560
00:49:27,751 --> 00:49:29,549
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

561
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:31,110
Yeah.

562
00:49:32,188 --> 00:49:33,679
Hey.

563
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:45,792
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Where you going?

564
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:49,135
I'm just gonna try to find
somewhere around here to take a piss.

565
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:56,437
I'm being active, Davie.
I'm on a hike right now.

566
00:49:56,513 --> 00:49:58,812
I'll do whatever it takes.

567
00:50:00,483 --> 00:50:02,418
Proactive?

568
00:50:02,485 --> 00:50:05,387
- Yeah, I'm doing that too.
I'm drinking less. - Hey.

569
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:08,755
Whoa!

570
00:50:08,825 --> 00:50:10,794
- I didn't mean anything.
- Nothing.

571
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,092
- Just somebody else on the trail.
- Have you seen Hannah?

572
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:19,868
Well, I realize I need to change.

573
00:50:19,936 --> 00:50:22,906
No, I don't want to change you.

574
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:24,463
Oh, shit.

575
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:27,238
I just dropped my lunch.

576
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:13,051
About time.

577
00:51:13,122 --> 00:51:15,216
I was beginning to get wor...

578
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:33,769
<i>♪ A ve Maria ♪</i>

579
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,424
- Hey, you. What the fuck?
- Run, you asshole.

580
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:55,261
- What the fuck, Hannah? Who the fuck
did this? - Just... fucking... run!

581
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:58,301
Hey! Help! Somebody, help us!

582
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:02,100
No, we gotta get this out first.
Okay? Okay?

583
00:52:02,171 --> 00:52:03,764
Do it.

584
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,333
Do it!

585
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,011
Who the fuck did this?

586
00:52:38,675 --> 00:52:40,735
- How long?
- Hmm?

587
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,143
How long have you been pregnant?

588
00:52:45,148 --> 00:52:47,379
I don't know what you're talking about.

589
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,544
Uh-huh.

590
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:52,487
You're pretty talented.

591
00:52:52,555 --> 00:52:55,389
What's a young girl like you
doing out of school?

592
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:57,620
- Long story.
- Yeah, I bet.

593
00:52:59,228 --> 00:53:02,164
How old are you?

594
00:53:02,231 --> 00:53:04,166
Oh. Never mind.

595
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:07,294
- Help me. Help me!
- Rachael? What happened?

596
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,362
- I found Jake.
- Where?

597
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,768
- Dead.
- Which direction?

598
00:53:14,844 --> 00:53:17,370
- There.
- You stay here with Betty. I'm gonna go...

599
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:19,575
No! I think it's Hannah.

600
00:53:19,649 --> 00:53:21,777
Don't be ridiculous.

601
00:53:24,153 --> 00:53:26,713
- Stay right there!
- It's her! Shoot her!

602
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:28,849
She's literally holding a bloody weapon.

603
00:53:28,925 --> 00:53:31,121
Bitch, I got a hole
in my leg because of you!

604
00:53:31,194 --> 00:53:32,890
What the fuck is going on?

605
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:36,899
All I see is a murderer
and a man with a gun!

606
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:40,630
- Logic dictates... - Logic dictates
you shut your whore-mongering mouth!

607
00:53:40,703 --> 00:53:42,399
- Calm down.
- That bitch killed this girl's brother.

608
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:44,134
They aren't brother and sister.

609
00:53:47,276 --> 00:53:50,246
- They look just alike.
- Who gives a fuck!

610
00:53:50,313 --> 00:53:52,544
Just shoot her!

611
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:56,052
Hey, you're not brother and sister,
are you?

612
00:53:58,154 --> 00:53:59,816
Shit. Look...

613
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:10,660
Ugh. You look pathetic.

614
00:54:14,003 --> 00:54:16,404
It's easier than doing it myself.

615
00:54:22,478 --> 00:54:24,413
Go!

616
00:54:32,321 --> 00:54:33,812
No.

617
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:52,798
Shh.

618
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,951
Okay.

619
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:08,167
<i>Mommy, I'm hungry.</i>

620
00:57:26,128 --> 00:57:29,758
I ha-have to get that gun.

621
00:57:29,832 --> 00:57:31,767
You're too hurt.

622
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:38,040
You can do this.

623
00:59:06,028 --> 00:59:07,519
Hannah.

624
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:11,590
Hannah?

625
00:59:12,702 --> 00:59:14,193
Hannah.

626
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:17,306
Mommy.

627
00:59:46,936 --> 00:59:48,427
Oh, God.

628
01:00:09,558 --> 01:00:11,049
Ow.

629
01:00:26,742 --> 01:00:30,611
<i>Uh, got them pair of pants you sewed me.</i>

630
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:32,375
<i>I love 'em.</i>

631
01:00:36,685 --> 01:00:38,620
<i>Thank you kindly.</i>

632
01:00:39,855 --> 01:00:42,586
<i>You know, I was thinking, uh...</i>

633
01:00:42,658 --> 01:00:45,218
<i>that maybe we could go to the lake today.</i>

634
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:49,297
<i>Catch some fish.</i>

635
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:52,130
<i>Have a mini tryst.</i>

636
01:00:53,836 --> 01:00:57,432
<i>It'll be so great for our boy
to see all this footage.</i>

637
01:01:02,711 --> 01:01:04,646
<i>What do you say?</i>

638
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:09,613
<i>I want an abortion.</i>

639
01:01:09,685 --> 01:01:13,178
<i>We have plenty of money.
We're married. I'm ready.</i>

640
01:01:13,255 --> 01:01:15,588
<i>We never talked about it.</i>

641
01:01:15,658 --> 01:01:18,890
<i>- You didn't ask me if I was ready.
- Okay, let's talk.</i>

642
01:01:21,063 --> 01:01:23,555
<i>My son's notgonna see
his father doing this.</i>

643
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:26,658
<i>No.</i>

644
01:01:28,904 --> 01:01:31,135
<i>- It's not your choice.
- I said no.</i>

645
01:01:31,207 --> 01:01:33,301
<i>So just shut up, and we'll go fishing.</i>

646
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,105
<i>- It's not...
- Shut up!</i>

647
01:01:35,177 --> 01:01:37,373
<i>- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
- You're scaring me.</i>

648
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:39,779
<i>You threaten the life of my son,
you fucking bitch!</i>

649
01:01:39,849 --> 01:01:42,148
<i>I will. I swear to God,
I will fucking do it.</i>

650
01:01:42,218 --> 01:01:44,744
<i>- Rae. You threaten my legacy, I swear to
God... - I'll cut it the fuck out!</i>

651
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,516
<i>- Put the fuckin' knife down!
- Get away from me!</i>

652
01:01:56,665 --> 01:01:58,156
<i>Come on.</i>

653
01:02:05,574 --> 01:02:08,066
<i>I don't want...</i>

654
01:02:08,144 --> 01:02:10,170
<i>- Jesus!
- Get it in your fuckin' mouth.</i>

655
01:02:16,752 --> 01:02:18,243
<i>Fuckin' hear me?</i>

656
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:33,500
<i>It's not so bad.</i>

657
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:55,522
<i>- Go to fuckin' God.
- No.</i>

658
01:02:55,591 --> 01:02:57,583
<i>- Blow your fuckin' brains out.
- No.</i>

659
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:04,657
<i>- Oh, no.
- Spread your fuckin' legs.</i>

660
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,275
<i>Ray!</i>

661
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:22,341
<i>Shut up.</i>

662
01:04:14,536 --> 01:04:16,869
<i>Ow!</i>

663
01:04:20,409 --> 01:04:23,902
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

664
01:04:23,979 --> 01:04:25,641
<i>Oh, God.</i>

665
01:04:29,618 --> 01:04:31,109
<i>Oh!</i>

666
01:04:51,874 --> 01:04:53,866
<i>- His name is Al.
- Ray.</i>

667
01:04:55,878 --> 01:04:57,870
<i>I want a divorce.</i>

668
01:05:08,624 --> 01:05:10,115
Hey.

669
01:05:11,794 --> 01:05:13,558
How you feelin'?

670
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:21,493
You look good.

671
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:25,630
Healthy.

672
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,882
Did you know...

673
01:05:36,952 --> 01:05:39,786
that a female body
can sustain a pregnancy...

674
01:05:39,855 --> 01:05:43,815
as young as five years old in some cases?

675
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:47,986
I got pregnant late by those standards.

676
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:53,465
But you...
Um...

677
01:05:53,535 --> 01:05:55,527
you look healthy.

678
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,872
Jake's the father, right? Your brother?

679
01:06:01,944 --> 01:06:03,810
Yeah.

680
01:06:03,879 --> 01:06:06,781
Don't look at me that way.

681
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:12,351
We both porked the guy, one way or another.

682
01:06:14,356 --> 01:06:17,292
Don't worry. I didn't eat him.

683
01:06:19,428 --> 01:06:21,693
I never acquired the taste.

684
01:06:23,766 --> 01:06:27,760
Yeah. I guess it'd be
so much easier if I did.

685
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,222
You're a shy one.

686
01:07:01,837 --> 01:07:05,171
Have you never seen
a naked woman's body before?

687
01:07:12,147 --> 01:07:16,016
Your brother's little prick is probably the only
thing you've ever seen of the natural world.

688
01:07:16,084 --> 01:07:19,486
Yeah? Yeah, you probably closed your eyes.

689
01:07:19,555 --> 01:07:21,615
You didn't want to see it, did ya?

690
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:24,888
Calm down!

691
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:34,469
It is just one mother talking to another.

692
01:07:34,536 --> 01:07:36,027
Honey.

693
01:07:37,473 --> 01:07:39,738
We understand each other.

694
01:07:39,808 --> 01:07:41,800
We're a lot alike.

695
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,171
You're sweet.

696
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:51,917
We have a lot in common.

697
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:04,294
You didn't love your brother,
did you? No. No.

698
01:08:04,366 --> 01:08:07,200
I could tell. That's good.

699
01:08:09,671 --> 01:08:11,731
I loved my husband.

700
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:15,744
I loved him.

701
01:08:18,981 --> 01:08:21,883
But he was a mean man with nasty habits.

702
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:26,617
And I could not kill Al after that.

703
01:08:29,558 --> 01:08:33,393
It's a shame he had to take after his dad.
Huh.

704
01:08:33,462 --> 01:08:36,557
Quickly learned breastfeeding
wasn't an option.

705
01:08:36,632 --> 01:08:38,123
You're crazy.

706
01:08:40,736 --> 01:08:43,365
At least I didn't fuck my brother.

707
01:08:43,438 --> 01:08:46,169
Wait.

708
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:50,945
Please don't kill me.

709
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:53,141
Please. Please.

710
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:56,575
I am not going to kill you.

711
01:08:59,254 --> 01:09:01,746
I'm going to raise your child.

712
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:05,087
Al needs somebody to bear this burden with.

713
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,063
Al needs a brother. Or a lover.

714
01:09:09,131 --> 01:09:10,895
Like hell!

715
01:09:13,035 --> 01:09:15,402
Very much like hell.

716
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:18,531
And back again!

717
01:09:20,676 --> 01:09:23,805
No one fucks with a Royal Cunt.

718
01:09:27,449 --> 01:09:29,680
You okay?

719
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:37,726
You take care of the rest.

720
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:40,957
Shouldn't you shoot her again,
or something?

721
01:09:41,029 --> 01:09:44,022
You little devil.
I've got something better in mind.

722
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:47,193
You just finish those ties.

723
01:09:54,509 --> 01:09:56,501
Aaah!

724
01:10:41,657 --> 01:10:43,148
Hannah.

725
01:10:46,428 --> 01:10:47,919
Hannah?

726
01:10:52,768 --> 01:10:54,760
Ha... Hannah?

727
01:12:57,759 --> 01:13:01,355
You stupid fucking girl.

728
01:13:05,801 --> 01:13:08,066
You die now.

729
01:13:10,272 --> 01:13:12,264
You thought you were special.

730
01:13:17,546 --> 01:13:19,879
Thought you could be loved?

731
01:13:28,156 --> 01:13:30,022
You're just a whore.

732
01:13:30,091 --> 01:13:34,552
Just a dead fucking whore.

733
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:41,432
I prefer the "C" word.

734
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:21,860
It's so good to have you
drawing again, sweetie.

735
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:32,040
- Your brother...
- I'm keeping the baby.

736
01:15:32,948 --> 01:15:34,746
No, of course.

737
01:15:34,816 --> 01:15:37,308
I'm naming her Hannah.

738
01:15:40,155 --> 01:15:42,454
That's lovely, um...

739
01:15:42,524 --> 01:15:45,119
We really should talk about what happened.

740
01:15:45,193 --> 01:15:47,924
No time, Mom. I'm gonna be late for school.

741
01:16:13,621 --> 01:16:16,682
- She ate the kid.
- No. The kid ate the mom.

742
01:16:16,758 --> 01:16:19,751
Or the mom was eating people... I
don't care. It was 15 years ago.

743
01:16:19,828 --> 01:16:23,663
- Dot. Dot.
- Everything's going to shit.

744
01:16:23,732 --> 01:16:26,361
Well, just go play with Nicole.

745
01:16:27,869 --> 01:16:31,328
- Your sister's fuckin' weird.
- Yeah.

746
01:16:31,406 --> 01:16:33,807
They ever find the kid?

747
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:35,309
Who knows? I don't care.

748
01:16:35,377 --> 01:16:37,141
That's awful.

749
01:16:37,212 --> 01:16:39,113
Excuse me for having a sense of history.

750
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,843
That doesn't even make sense.

751
01:16:54,462 --> 01:16:55,953
Mommy?

752
01:21:24,499 --> 01:21:26,491
