if this joint was built

on an Indian burial ground.

152
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,916
Uh, it was built
on an old Kmart,

153
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,085
and he's never mentioned
a word of this to me.

154
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,729
That's because he doesn't
want anyone to know.

155
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,960
We've sworn silence.

156
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,578

00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,769
Well, you can't take her calls,

160
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:44,069
because you downloaded
a rogue app

161
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,137

- Seventeen viruses.
- I see.

164
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:49,975
- So you have a girlfriend?
- I do.

165
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,936
Dolores, I'm gonna be honest
with you.

166
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,105
I only said "black Jell-O"
because that was Gus' nickname

it could cost him his job,

to that abandoned building.

174
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:09,620
His only recollection
of his shooter is a silhouette,

175
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:11,205
he's on nine different
medications,

176
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,790
and as you both know,
he suffered a massive stroke

177
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:13,975
during surgery.

178
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,927
So of course he's seeing things,

179
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,795
but feeding into these fantasies

180
