1
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,908
Sorry.

2
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:30,523
Hello?

3
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,827
Sorry, I didn't know anyone was in there.

4
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:36,130
Oh, god it's mine, I left it here.

5
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,701
Have a nice day.

6
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:48,649
Sure, thank you.

7
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:06,186
What a shithole.

8
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:08,236
Oh, fuck!

9
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:15,597
There.

10
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,257
Where is she?

11
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,007
Hey it's Kennedy, where's Valerie?

12
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:42,137
Well, can you get her?

13
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
Thanks.

14
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,790
Hey, what are you doing girl?

15
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,679
That sounds fun.

16
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,630
Er, get your shit and get
packed, we're going to the cabin.

17
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,099
Why? Why not?

18
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,313
I already called El and Davis;
they're they're on their way.

19
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,429
You need to get away.

20
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,929
We all need to get away and
this is the perfect weekend.

21
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,913
So get your shit, shut up.

22
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,413
I'll pick you up, 11.

23
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,973
That's not gonna work for you?

24
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,123
Well it's gonna work,
so just make it happen.

25
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Yeah.

26
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,289
I don't, I don't care
what they have planned.

27
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,549
This is more important.

28
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,409
Tell 'em to fuck off and
we'll be good.

29
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,410
All right, 11.

30
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,423
All right, all right, I'll see you then.

31
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Bye!

32
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:45,859
- Oh good.
- Yeah.

33
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,312
If you push me down,
you're fucking dead.

34
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,712
I'll push you from behind.

35
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,219
What are you laughing
at, I can get you too.

36
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,037
I'll bomb you off this damn cliff.

37
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:57,028
- After bowling.
- Oh yeah.

38
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,519
I know.

39
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:06,533
Let's just stay here,
it won't be a problem.

40
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:07,617
- Oh.
- Great.

41
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,966
Hah, are you the king of silver mount?

42
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,896
This is so cool guys,
then why don't we stop here?

43
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,854
Well, we wouldn't stop here

44
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,487
if hitting the green slammed that tumble.

45
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:19,530
Look at this, it's redneck one shot.

46
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,759
Tell you what,

47
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,160
15 bucks you land it on
that cushion down there.

48
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:29,423
Right, sell that for 17.50, that's a deal.

49
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:31,869
Why are you breaking my balls, man?

50
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,419
I'm doing nothing, keep it.

51
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,029
15 bucks is a good deal.

52
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,536
15 is a good deal,
17.50 is a better deal.

53
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:38,598
What are you gonna do with 50 cents?

54
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,432
You can't even buy a popple.

55
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,152
That's $2 and 50 cents
where I come from, boys.

56
00:16:41,153 --> 00:16:44,897
Well, I guess you could
hit something there.

57
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,173
Oh, what a beautiful shithole.

58
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
It's pretty gorgeous, nice and rustic.

59
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,839
Nothing rustic about
it, it's a giant shithole.

60
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,049
There's a broken couch.

61
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,279
People come here and
dump their trash here.

62
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,150
Why are we here?

63
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:05,609
Well, we could set it on fire.

64
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,610
Probably dump more than trash here.

65
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:07,964
There's bullets everywhere.

66
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,309
Like, what are we doing?

67
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,467
You almost hit the bucket, what, uh-oh.

68
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,266
You going again?

69
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,266
Yeah, I'm going again.

70
00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:18,696
Uh right, I nicked it, I nicked it.

71
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:20,129
If you didn't nick that bucket,

72
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,239
tonight you'll be nicking a few beers

73
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,339
and everything at the
party trumps all of this.

74
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,932
- It better.
- Debbie, don't.

75
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:29,209
Have I let you down before?

76
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,172
No.

77
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:31,070
Do you really want me to answer that?

78
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:32,890
Well, not this year, but...

79
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,769
Where the hell's Theresa at?

80
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,030
Her grandma, for the weekend.

81
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,776
I dunno, probably just needed a break.

82
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:44,373
The year's been weird.

83
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,085
Man, what are you doing?

84
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:50,260
I thought it was you, that ain't me.

85
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,999
What's so weird about it?

86
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,679
I don't, I don't know.

87
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,259
I just feel like every,

88
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,553
every second someone's
two steps behind me.

89
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:03,229
Like, I feel crazy.

90
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,803
Like, I feel like somebody's watching me.

91
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:09,225
Is it Rockwell stuff?

92
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:11,567
Women's shower?

93
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,814
I'm afraid to wash my hair!

94
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,741
- Really guys?
- Oh, come on.

95
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:17,575
- I'm being serious.
- I know, you know,

96
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:20,269
you know the old form, we're just playing.

97
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,819
Well, maybe when you've had a few beers,

98
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,669
you'll take my story seriously.

99
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,333
Oh, there's gonna be a few beers.

100
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:28,799
Gonna be a few tears
coming from the beers.

101
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,113
And our beards, and
your beard, it's possible.

102
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:47,897
Fuck off!

103
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:49,249
- Oh, shit.
- Oh.

104
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,626
Nice day for a trespass, ain't it.

105
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:52,960
- The cops.
- Us?

106
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,333
Yeah, sure.

107
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,019
We're just hanging out, sir.

108
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,599
My guess is you haven't heard the story

109
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,683
of little Sallie Mae Cortez;

110
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,343
came up to the quarry on
a day about like this,

111
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,003
nice sunny day.

112
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,563
Playing down here with her
tin cans, ball of foil.

113
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,289
Her dad was a popular crop duster,

114
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,990
ain't money to crop dusting, boys.

115
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,069
She's down here by herself,

116
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,409
no one around to hear her scream.

117
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,360
She slipped, heard a rattlesnake, fell.

118
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,720
Say all that was left
of her, the bears got.

119
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,399
If you think it's fun to come down here

120
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,823
and fiddle and fuck around,

121
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,550
you think about little Sallie Mae.

122
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,573
- Whatever.
- He's crazy.

123
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Oh, wow.

124
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:45,873
Are you serious?

125
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,243
That's not a joke?

126
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:51,793
Guess the hell if it is, I
don't see what's so damn funny.

127
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,679
Something, something funny
around here, Chris Elliott,

128
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,239
you got some jokes to make?

129
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,549
Man, I just...

130
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,089
What about you, cock Nick?

131
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,189
We're up here at the
quarry, having a good time.

132
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,190
Here you come.

133
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:07,066
What the fuck's your name? Summer's Eve?

134
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,469
That's funny to you?

135
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,939
You're funny man.

136
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,773
- What.
- That's funny.

137
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:12,909
You wanna know how to shut the fuck up?

138
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,869
You want to know what else is funny?

139
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,870
This right here.

140
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:18,413
That mean anything to you?

141
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:20,390
Seen a badge before.

142
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,879
Well, it means a hell
of a lot to the state.

143
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,903
So does trespassing.

144
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:24,679
There's no signs up here.

145
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,759
Son, I will fucking bite your tongue

146
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,960
right out of your mouth.

147
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,389
Guys, wait time's over,
the time for fucking off

148
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,919
is right now, I can arrest all
three of you, fucking dicks.

149
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,821
I'm not going back to jail, man.

150
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:38,169
You'll go back, if I say you'll go back.

151
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,353
Look sir, we'll leave okay.

152
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:43,299
No trouble.
We'll leave, okay.

153
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,133
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

154
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,080
That's great, that's great.

155
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,913
I can't wait for you to get-

156
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:49,089
- Actually guys, we should,
yeah, let's just go.

157
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,095
Actually guys, you
should yeah, you should go.

158
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:51,929
Come on.

159
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:52,917
We don't want any trouble.

160
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,979
Okay, let's go, come on.

161
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,859
You don't want trouble? Too late.

162
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,760
Go and put some eyeliner on some more.

163
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,299
Back there.

164
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,343
Come on.
Come on.

165
00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:27,853
It's my quarry.

166
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:31,471
I would like you to take

167
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:32,304
the word of God, please,

168
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:33,825
and turn with me in the Old Testament,

169
00:21:34,704 --> 00:21:36,704
to the book of Isaiah, the 45th chapter.

170
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:40,349
I'll begin reading at
verse one in Isaiah 45:1.

171
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:45,435
- $13.80
- All right.

172
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,639
All the
miracles that He performed.

173
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,720
They heard Him say, "Take
up your bed and walk,"

174
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:53,554
then the lame man walked.

175
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:54,448
Thank you.

176
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:55,887
They experienced the blind man

177
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:57,886
to be able to see.

178
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:01,242
Then Jesus looked at His
disciples and He said,

179
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:06,243
"Man, there ain't nothing
you can do more than that."

180
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,044
Hit me, just
a minute for me, okay.

181
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:11,626
Than to say,
"Take up your bed and walk."

182
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,636
I've given you the power to alter...

183
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:18,600
"I have holden, subdued nations before Him"

184
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,369
and I will loose the loins of kings

185
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,879
to open before him the two leaved gates

186
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,483
and the gates shall not be shut.

187
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,109
I will go before thee and make
the crooked places straight.

188
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,509
I will break in pieces,

189
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,867
"the gates of brass and cut
in sunder the bars of iron."

190
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,942
"Thou mayest know that I, the Lord,

191
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:51,807
which call thee by thy name..."

192
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,973
"For Jacob my servant's sake,
and Israel mine elect ..."

193
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:00,399
Everything all right here, citizens.

194
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,613
Yeah, we-

195
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,654
- I wasn't talking to you!

196
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,579
Everything all right here?
Yes sir.

197
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:11,287
Keep that away.

198
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:13,803
Okay, having a good time here...

199
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:15,304
Have a good day.

200
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,159
Look, we can't do
anything in this stupid town

201
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,757
without being caught.

202
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,833
It's, it's just luck.

203
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:32,623
Yeah, he's everywhere, he's
the only thing they've got.

204
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:36,312
Let me give you some advice.

205
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,010
What have you got?

206
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:40,131
You all be careful out there.

207
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:44,126
All right.

208
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:47,417
Go on, run.

209
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:48,503
Then verse 21.

210
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:52,549
"Tell ye, and bring them near;"

211
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,939
yea, let them take counsel together:

212
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,379
who hath declared this from ancient time?

213
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,609
Who hath told it from that time?

214
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,389
Have not I the Lord?

215
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,643
And there is no God else beside Me;

216
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,863
a just God and a Savior;
there is none beside Me.

217
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,239
Look unto me, and be ye saved,
all the ends of the earth:

218
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,297
"for I am God, and there is none else."

219
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,793
Booze is here!

220
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,717
I'm sure you alerted
all those ball bears.

221
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,789
Well, ball bears don't go
kicking cans in the quarry.

222
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,296
Hey, we're here, boys!

223
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:32,194
Did I hear someone say, "Booze"?

224
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,465
Been a long time since
we hanged out like this.

225
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:38,299
Yeah.

226
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,143
- Well overdue, boys.
- Got out of the city.

227
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:47,182
I'm just glad to be away
from the kids for a little bit.

228
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:49,188
Ain't that the truth, not much.

229
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:50,199
Huh, right, like you have a kid.

230
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,239
Well, never will.

231
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,353
To take care of.

232
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:55,450
That was your first and last mistake.

233
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,760
Well, it's not a mistake that I made,

234
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:01,123
I'm not sure about the first.

235
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,247
Well, I think we've got
bigger things to worry about

236
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:05,079
like bald fish.

237
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,219
Well, ball bearing
kids kicking the cans.

238
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
What was that?

239
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:10,919
Was that guy for real?

240
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,837
He's real, he's real.

241
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:16,919
Like, what if all the cops
around here are like that?

242
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,279
That's what happens; you grow up a dick,

243
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,899
you gotta be a dick to be a cop,

244
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,850
so you can be a bigger dick,
push around the little people.

245
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:28,149
It just seemed like
he didn't give a shit.

246
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,933
- Well.
- Oh, he didn't give a shit.

247
00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:33,929
- Well.
- Think we're on twos.

248
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,129
Not only being here, finally getting out,

249
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,162
away from the kids, away from the store,

250
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,783
away from job.

251
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,945
I'm gonna toast throwing
that fuck cop in the quarry.

252
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:47,818
Hell, fucking hell.

253
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:48,941
Here's to not getting arrested.

254
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:50,231
And not getting arrested.

255
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:51,850
- Amen.
- And not getting arrested.

256
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:55,629

You really are my favorite duck.

Uh?

Now I have a real friend.

325
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:43,095
I'm gonna call you er, Geoffrey.

326
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:50,957
Brings his very life,

327
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,630
of always whatever he'd like to be called.

328
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,228
Gee whizz.

329
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:00,229
Baby duck.

330
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,180
Valerie!

331
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:44,369
Val!

332
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,120
Guys, wake up!

333
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,656
Yo, wake up.

334
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,142
Wake up!

335
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:00,243
Did you all see Valerie?

336
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:02,356
- No.
- She wait for something?

337
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:04,009
- Valerie!
- What about her?

338
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,539
She's gone, she's missing.

339
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,373
Well, out in the woods, probably.

340
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:07,463
Did she go with him?

341
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,689
Yes, my name is Jake Thompson.

342
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,669
I'm up here at the Old Heath cabin.

343
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,893
Er, my car got stolen.

344
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,769
Yeah, we're, I'm up here with some friends

345
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,899
and er, well we er, well, we had some fun

346
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,779
and now my car is gone
and we have no way of

347
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,230
getting back to civilization.

348
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,473

Detective Baldwin, local police,

499
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,037
got a few questions for yer.

500
01:05:38,406 --> 01:05:39,371
We got a little bit of a situation.

501
01:05:39,372 --> 01:05:41,177
You got some kids finger fucking
around, down at the quarry,

502
01:05:41,178 --> 01:05:43,477
fiddle-farting around in a cabin
they shouldn't have been in

503
01:05:43,478 --> 01:05:44,330
and we got a missing girl here, now.

504
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:46,983
She's got a brown hair or something.

505
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,590
Her name's Mallory or Valerie, cunt face,

506
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,443
real, real shitty looking
face the whole time.

507
01:05:53,435 --> 01:05:54,935
Have you seen her?

508
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:57,679
That's all you've got for me, uh-uh?

509
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,709
Well shake your head, no.

510
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,149
You can't speak up?

511
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,620
You got an officer of
the law, standing here,

512
01:06:03,621 --> 01:06:04,839
looking at your dead fuck in the eyes

513
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,990
and you can't even
mutter a sentence to me?

514
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,598
Are you some kind of arsehole, sir?

515
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:13,910

518
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,569
This cost more than that shit weasel car

519
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:22,420
you're driving around right now, boy.

520
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,999
I work for the city and the state.

521
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,600
You think I want to be here
fucking around with you?

522
01:06:31,203 --> 01:06:32,203
Halt!

523
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,923
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

524
01:06:39,568 --> 01:06:40,739

528
01:06:52,024 --> 01:06:53,024
You wash your hands?

529
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,449
Listen, let me ask you something.

530
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:58,137
Who takes care of you?

531
01:06:58,138 --> 01:06:59,863
Surely you don't wipe your arse yourself.

532
01:07:02,471 --> 01:07:03,304
Right down there.

533
01:07:03,304 --> 01:07:04,304
You live in there?

534
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:06,868
'70s vinyl.

535
01:07:06,869 --> 01:07:09,251
'70s vinyl?

536
01:07:09,252 --> 01:07:11,352
You telling me about '70s vinyl?

537
01:07:11,353 --> 01:07:13,142
Right, '70s vinyl.

538
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:14,839
Son, you must be some kind of retard.

539
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,339
You live down there?

540
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,789
You want me to come take
a look at your vinyl?

541
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,369
Back that way.

542
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,619
Tell you what, I'd like
to see how a retard lives,

543
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:22,620
let's take a look.

544
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,889
It might be, it might be
worth a laugh if nothing else.

545
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,403
Lead the way there, paunch.

546
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:29,570
'70s vinyl.

547
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:33,619
Is this it?

548
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:36,064
Is this where you live?

549
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,150
What are you, the people
under the fucking stairs?

550
01:07:41,701 --> 01:07:42,701
Police!

551
01:07:59,361 --> 01:08:00,361
Excuse me.

552
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,803
Well dog my cats.

553
01:08:14,313 --> 01:08:19,313
Huh, it's awesome.

554
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,493
Son, I underestimated you,

555
01:08:24,483 --> 01:08:25,883
you got a whole set up here.

556
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,033
Well, holy shit,

557
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,633
Summer's Eve.

558
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,655
I bet you didn't think
you'd see me again, did you?

559
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,466
Where'd you find this one?

560
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:45,419
What's that?

561
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,200
Are you gonna smart off to me now?

562
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:49,283
You got a lot to say, now?

563
01:08:50,275 --> 01:08:52,979
You had a big mouth when
your friends were around.

564
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,100
Can I tell you a secret, I'm
gonna tell you something.

565
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:58,109
Your fuckin' friends are dead.

566
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:00,023
I'm gonna show you their insides.

567
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:05,563
Fuckin' throw them in that
quarry, that's my quarry.

568
01:09:07,993 --> 01:09:12,993
God damn
Copernicus, look at these wraps.

569
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:18,119
Fuckin' teach yourself
in here or something?

570
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,120
You want some?

571
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,765
You don't feed 'em too much do you, here.

572
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:23,147
Have some.

573
01:09:23,148 --> 01:09:24,502
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh?

574
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:26,664
Uh-hu there, eat it!

575
01:09:26,665 --> 01:09:27,815
Eat it, oh that's good.

576
01:09:37,725 --> 01:09:38,725
That one?

577
01:09:40,308 --> 01:09:41,548
I outta teach you how to speak.

578
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:48,533
Well, this one's about half zombified.

579
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:51,099
Hmm?

580
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,233
Gonna gangrene if she has.

581
01:09:54,304 --> 01:09:55,137
That's fine, we'll just
stick that one there

582
01:09:55,138 --> 01:09:57,363
until she er, takes care of herself.

583
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,160
God damn.

584
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,269
This is awesome.

585
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,433
This is awesome!

586
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,019
I would dream about
having a place like this,

587
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,936
I never knew, I never knew how to do it.

588
01:10:09,937 --> 01:10:12,823
And you got the whole
set up, I mean, you know,

589
01:10:13,954 --> 01:10:17,083
it's a little grandma in
here, but we could fix that.

590
01:10:18,015 --> 01:10:20,229
Get a fucking "Hot Rod" poster up there.

591
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,203
God damn, listen, here's your deal.

592
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:25,845
I got this fuckin' badge, man.

593
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,174
Hah, we can do whatever we want,

594
01:10:27,175 --> 01:10:28,999
we can start a fucking empire.

595
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,894
We could do this for a living.

596
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:34,159
You know what, guys would come
and pay to come down here.

597
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,010
They'd pay to come down here
and fuck with these bitches.

598
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:41,439
We could do it, we could
do it big, for real.

599
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,390
Mm-hm, does that...

600
01:10:43,391 --> 01:10:44,427
Listen, if we're gonna do this,

601
01:10:44,428 --> 01:10:46,668
if we're going to be
partners in this thing,

602
01:10:46,669 --> 01:10:48,252
I'm gonna need you to talk a little bit.

603
01:10:48,253 --> 01:10:49,443
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

604
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:51,626
That a deal?

605
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:55,969
Listen, can I tell you a secret?

606
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:58,153
I never liked these
fucking things until today.

607
01:11:04,822 --> 01:11:07,229
Think they look good?

608
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:09,897
Don't wanna talk about it now.

609
01:11:26,927 --> 01:11:28,549
Run!

610
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,563
God damn it.

611
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,399
Shit, hold on.

612
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,429
Fuck your bud, I got the
badge, don't worry about it.

613
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:42,429
Bring her back, we'll take
down those missing signs.

614
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:43,430
One side,

615
01:11:46,743 --> 01:11:47,743
ga-gaw!

616
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,009
Whoo, whoa, halt!

617
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,369
Give us that badge, yeah.

618
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:58,423
Hold it right there.

619
01:13:01,156 --> 01:13:03,966
Na, no, no, no, no, no, no.

620
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,689
Oh no, that's trespass you know.

621
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,379
Detective Baldwin, I'm with the police,

622
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,696
this just can't go here,
you've gotta move along.

623
01:13:09,697 --> 01:13:10,530
It's just a missing girl.

624
01:13:10,531 --> 01:13:11,549
Yeah, well I'd like to have you missing

625
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:12,799
from the premises, ma'am.

626
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,678
Go on, get out of here,
that's litter actually.

627
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:15,531
I'm very sorry.

628
01:13:15,532 --> 01:13:18,281
