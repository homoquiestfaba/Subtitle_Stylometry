00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,653
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:16,047
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,056
- [Boy] Okay freshmen, you've
got two minutes to run.

4
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:27,513
Then we come and get ya!

5
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:28,346
Go!

6
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:30,998
Did you see 'em take off?

7
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,516
They just get dumber every day.

8
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:35,209
- [Boy] Yeah, genetic weakness I betcha!

9
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,042
(laughing)

10
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:37,125
- [Boy] Yeah.

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,041
- [Boy] Hurry up, load 'em up!

12
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:45,512
Coming to get you, Kimball!

13
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,333
(laughing)

14
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:55,725
Kimball, Kimball the thimble.

15
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,975
(laughing)

16
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:02,684
Alright, that's two minutes.

17
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:03,681
You ready?

18
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:04,685
- [Boy] I'm always ready.

19
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:06,102
- [Boy] Let's go.

20
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:10,654
You better run!

21
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,494
(laughing)

22
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:15,690
Hey it's survival of the fittest, Kimball!

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,092
This is awesome!

24
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:20,675
- [Boy] Come out come
out wherever you are.

25
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,276
You might as well give up you freshmen!

26
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:27,537
We'll be easier on you!

27
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:30,375
- Guys, can we make a deal?

28
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,976
I got two Snickers in my backpack!

29
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:36,013
- [Boy] No way, we ain't
making no deals man.

30
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,356
- Please!

31
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:38,356
- [Boys] No!

32
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:42,039
- [Boy] That's right
Kimball, you better run!

33
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,789
(exciting music)

34
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:50,519
Don't make us madder than we already are!

35
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,438
(laughing)

36
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:54,605
(howling)

37
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:02,496
- Hurry up, catch him!
- Run, run!

38
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,079
I smell fresh meat!

39
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:06,716
Almost.
- Lazy shot, dude.

40
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:08,049
- [Boy] Come on!

41
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,076
Hey Kimball, hey Kimball!

42
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:17,429
Paging Dr. Kimball!
(laughing)

43
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,272
Ah man.

44
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,994
Run little piggy, run!

45
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:31,806
- [Boy] Can't you run any faster?

46
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:34,056
(laughing)

47
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,327
Hands up, piggy!

48
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,244
- Okay guys, I give up.

49
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:45,767
- [Boy] Gotcha Kimball.

50
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,091
- [Boy] We got you now.

51
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:49,341
(laughing)

52
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,717
- Not bad, huh?

53
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,431
A noble effort.

54
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:56,514
- For a shrimpus maximus.

55
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,232
- Any last words?

56
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:12,688
Guess not.

57
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:20,253
- [Boys] Three, two, one.

58
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:21,836
- Ready, aim, fire!

59
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:26,565
(paintball guns firing)

60
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,982
(crying out)

61
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:30,901
- [Kimball] Man, you messed up my clothes.

62
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:33,151
(laughing)

63
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,139
- School colors!

64
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,043
Blue and gold!

65
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:44,460
- Welcome to Washington High.

66
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,848
- Freshmen.

67
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:48,598
You guys are the same every year.

68
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:52,971
- My mom's gonna kill me about this shirt.

69
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:55,430
- You know Kimball, you're
not such a bad guy after all.

70
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,891
And to show you what good guys we are

71
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,504
we'll let you shoot some
pellets so you'll be ready

72
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,857
when you're a senior.

73
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:03,384
Go set these targets up, past that tree.

74
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:04,418
(laughing)

75
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,501
Moron.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,900
(eerie music)

77
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:25,911
- Guys.

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,179
Soldiers.

79
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:29,878
- Yeah, I know they're soldiers.

80
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:32,295
I got them at Walmart, moron.

81
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:35,345
- No!

82
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,291
I mean real soldiers!

83
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:41,560
- What?

84
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,598
- [Kimball] Hey guys, how about a ride

85
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,061
on the back of your bike?

86
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,357
- [Boy] You're on your own, man.

87
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:48,760
- Thanks for nothing!
- Run!

88
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,510
(dramatic music)

89
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,279
(screams)

90
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:52,247
- Whoa.

91
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,875
What are you doing?
- You're coming with us.

92
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,458
- [Kimball] No, no!

93
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:13,986
- This is a disaster.

94
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,473
- Come on guys, let me go.

95
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:18,737
I've got two Snickers in my backpack.

96
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:19,570
Come on.

97
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:24,438
- Make sure the perimeter
is secure, that's an order.

98
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:28,714
This little event could
severely compromise the project.

99
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:30,657
- Well, at least we know it works.

100
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,697
- Works!

101
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:32,614
It was supposed to make them invisible,

102
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:34,989
not send them off into some new dimension.

103
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,151
Can we get them back?

104
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:37,149
- Back?

105
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:41,316
I'm more concerned about
what we're gonna do with him.

106
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:43,549
- Me?

107
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:45,031
I didn't see a thing!

108
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,934
Well I saw something, but
it was so unbelievable

109
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,591
that I couldn't have seen it.

110
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,869
And by the way, did I
mention that I've got

111
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,467
two Snickers in my backpack?

112
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:54,467
- Sorry kid.

113
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:57,844
Chocolate makes me nauseous.

114
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:13,884
- No, no!

115
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,953
(zaps)

116
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:17,612
- Alright gentlemen,

117
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:20,833
let's make our other problems disappear.

118
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,666
Move out!

119
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:37,413
(booming)

120
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,163
(exciting music)

121
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,886
(gentle music)

122
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,358
- Where's this one go?

123
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:41,191
It's not labeled.

124
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,470
- Andy, just set that down, I'll get it.

125
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,548
- I don't mind.

126
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:47,298
- It's fragile Andy, I'll get it.

127
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,437
- Dad, Dad, Dad!

128
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:55,757
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

129
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:59,840
You better be careful
there, you little wild man.

130
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:07,080
I gotta check in at work.

131
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,097
- The pizza's on its way.

132
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,699
- Well I'm sorry hon,
you'll have to save me

133
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:10,782
a few slices.

134
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:15,580
Andy.

135
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:23,176
Now listen, you know I
appreciate your help.

136
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:26,283
I just don't want you to touch
any of the unlabeled boxes.

137
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:27,603
Okay?

138
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:28,436
- Okay.
- Okay?

139
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,519
- Fine, yeah.

140
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,925
(roaring)

141
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:45,350
Come on Cameron.

142
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,673
You can help me destroy the upstairs.

143
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:48,933
Go on, I'll meet you up there.

144
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,412
Here, let me help you with that.

145
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:54,153
- Oh, you're saving my life.

146
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:56,331
How do you like the place?

147
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,233
- I like the old place better.

148
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:01,593
- I know, but your dad
couldn't pass up this job.

149
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:03,833
- John's not my dad.

150
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,673
- He adores you and Cameron.

151
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:07,432
You know that, don't you?

152
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:08,532
- He adores Cameron.

153
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:12,252
I mean I'm just another troublesome teen.

154
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:14,255
- That's unfair, Andy.

155
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:16,289
I understand how you must feel,

156
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,711
but you've got to try to see things

157
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:20,628
from John's point of view.

158
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:23,545
(mysterious music)

159
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:45,943
- We're ready for the
sequencing demo, Boyd.

160
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:50,081
Let's start with level
one but build it up slow.

161
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,779
- Righty-o.

162
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,946
(beeping)

163
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,427
- Alright, let's go to
level two, reach stability.

164
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,151
Alright.

165
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:11,554
Well well.

166
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:13,549
Oh Boyd.

167
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:17,660
You lied about quitting smoking.

168
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,663
And your lunch looks like something

169
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:21,663
that might make a repeat appearance.

170
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,933
- Privacy.

171
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,986
A thing of the past.

172
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,902
- We're destabilizing.

173
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,520
Try level three right now, hurry.

174
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,143
Hurry!

175
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:35,976
Hurry!

176
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:39,309
(beeping)

177
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:51,361
Oh, we were so close!

178
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,801
(clapping)

179
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:54,599
- Bravo, John.

180
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,703
That's the nearest we've ever
come to stabilizing the image.

181
00:11:57,703 --> 00:11:59,020
How'd you do it?

182
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,636
- I just replaced the old processors

183
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:04,001
with self-cooling crystal chips.

184
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,300
Just declassified by military.

185
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,340
- How'd you get that so fast?

186
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,601
- Friends in low places, I guess.

187
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:13,020
- You've been with us less than a week

188
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,207
and you've already
accomplished more than we have

189
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,983
in six months.

190
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,481
Isn't that right, Boyd?

191
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:19,863
- Oh yes sir, Mr. Baker.

192
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:22,276
Old John's a real achiever.

193
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,943
We make a good team.

194
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:30,423
- Get me a cup of coffee would you Boyd?

195
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:31,497
- I don't remember seeing coffee jockey

196
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:33,914
listed in my job description.

197
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,616
Is that a cream with two sugars?

198
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:38,503
- Absolutely.

199
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:43,339
John, I want to thank you
for relocating so quickly.

200
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:45,740
- Don't mention it, I
appreciate the opportunity.

201
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,980
And the family's adjusting
okay, with one exception.

202
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,220
- Ah, you've got a teenager.

203
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,442
(chuckling)

204
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,700
- And how.

205
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,660
My stepson, his name's
Andy, he's a sophomore.

206
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,098
We pulled him out of school mid-September.

207
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:03,602
He left his one best friend,
four potential girlfriends.

208
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:04,658
You do the math.

209
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,620
- Not too happy a lad, I take it.

210
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,255
- Oh Mr. Baker, you're a
master of understatement.

211
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,780
- I might be able to help.

212
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,559
I'll call the science
teacher at Washington High

213
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,460
and arrange a field trip to the labs.

214
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,639
Your stepson can see where
you work, his chums can see

215
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,053
how cool you are, instant popularity,

216
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:27,023
end of adjustment problem.

217
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,327
- You can arrange that?

218
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:30,861
- Well it does help to be on good terms

219
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:33,407
with the president of the school board.

220
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,807
- Let me guess, you.

221
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,307
- Modesty forbids.

222
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,177
- Hey butthead.

223
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,797
Hey, you don't show me much.

224
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,733
- I got nothing to prove.

225
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,467
- 'Cause you've got nothing!

226
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,717
(laughing)

227
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,712
- You got something to say?

228
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:22,629
- Ha ha ha.

229
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,325
(honks)

230
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:33,885
- Andy, it's a school day tomorrow.

231
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,718
Come on, come on home.

232
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:42,739
- Now in lateral magnification for rays,

233
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,547
the rays coming from an object point not

234
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:47,882
on the object axis is called a coma.

235
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,043
Now if a coma is present
light from a point

236
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:52,422
is spread around into a family.

237
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:54,422
Guys guys please please.

238
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:59,483
So can anyone here name other
electromagnetic radiation

239
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:03,343
that cannot be seen by the naked eye?

240
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:06,605
Sam, can you give somebody
else a chance please?

241
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,522
- Like who?

242
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,571
- [Teacher] Anybody?

243
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:15,384
- Okay how about microwave and infrared.

244
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:16,664
- That's a good start.

245
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:17,497
Iris.

246
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,141
- The other side of the spectrum.

247
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:23,501
Ultraviolet radiation, x-rays, gamma rays.

248
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,581
- Well I'm glad somebody
does her homework here.

249
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,831
(giggling)

250
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,285
(clears throat)

251
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,202
Mr. Carver.

252
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:37,217
Can you tell us the range on the spectrum

253
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,717
where the visible light falls?

254
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,313
You just moved here from Chicago, right?

255
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:46,316
- Yeah.

256
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:49,113
- Let's imagine you could
cut the country in half.

257
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:52,113
Chicago would fall roughly in the...

258
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,494
- In the middle?

259
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,661
- So the range of visible
light would fall in the...

260
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:01,873
- Middle of the spectrum?

261
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,333
- Nicely done.

262
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,416
Light from the sun that's white light

263
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:11,153
can be refracted through a
prism into all wavelengths

264
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:11,986
of light.

265
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:14,497
- [Boy] It's the rainbow.

266
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:18,775
- Kind of like the album cover
of Dark Side of the Moon.

267
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:21,442
The album Dark Side of the Moon?

268
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:25,686
Pink Floyd?

269
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:26,944
- Dude!

270
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,777
Yeah dude!

271
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,277
- You know guys, there was rock and roll

272
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:32,363
before The Offspring, huh?

273
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:34,759
(school bell rings)

274
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,984
Wait wait wait.

275
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:38,640
Listen, before you leave,
make sure make sure make sure

276
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,421
you get your permission slips
signed for the field trip

277
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:42,203
tomorrow, we're going to VectreComp.

278
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:43,036
Okay?

279
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:52,780
(gentle music)

280
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,084
- [Girl] Hey, there's the new kid.

281
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:57,900
- Hey, where's Carver's buttcrack?

282
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,543
In the middle!

283
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,240
(laughing)

284
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,061
- At least I'm not a Neanderthal.

285
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,811
- Smarter than he looks.
- Mm hmm.

286
00:17:07,913 --> 00:17:10,163
(growling)

287
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,896
- Hmm, who replaced my son with Godzilla?

288
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:23,146
(laughing)

289
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,399
(door shuts)

290
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,732
(whistling)

291
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:36,854
- Hi Dad.

292
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,235
- Hi.

293
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:42,341
- What were you doing in the basement?

294
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:45,174
- Oh, nothing exciting I'm afraid.

295
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,242
So, how's the new school?

296
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:50,326
- Good.

297
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:52,339
- Thrilling.

298
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,442
- Any girls?

299
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,352
(laughs)

300
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:14,592
- I have to go finish unpacking my room.

301
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:15,425
- Andy.

302
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:20,369
Andy.

303
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:30,515
(laughs)

304
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,914
(dog barking)

305
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:39,111
(soft music)

306
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:58,794
(knocking)

307
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:01,903
- [John] Can I come in?

308
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:02,736
- Yeah.

309
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,523
- It's gonna take a long
time, Andy, getting used

310
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:31,124
to the death of someone that you loved.

311
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:32,207
- Used to it?

312
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:34,562
- Yeah, you know.

313
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,465
Well you hear people talk
about getting over it,

314
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:40,942
but I don't think that's what happens.

315
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:44,192
I think you just adjust and you endure.

316
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:00,644
- You know my science class
is going on a field trip

317
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:03,241
to VectroComp tomorrow.

318
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,324
- Yeah I know, looking forward to it.

319
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,231
You know what I wish?

320
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:18,144
That I could have met your dad.

321
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,244
- John.

322
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:36,588
- Yeah.

323
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:40,167
- I'm looking forward to it also.

324
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,607
The field trip.

325
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,440
- Good.

326
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:50,145
Good night.
- Good night.

327
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,388
(light music)

328
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:08,385
- Hey Jerry.
- Oh thanks

329
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:10,001
for letting us do this.

330
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,242
So kids, come over here, we need to get

331
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:13,121
your ID badges on you.

332
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,121
Yes you too.

333
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:19,532
- Here's one for you.

334
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:22,321
Young lady.

335
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,364
And you.

336
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:26,077
- [Teacher] Please keep
your ID badges on you

337
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,077
at all times, okay kids?

338
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:31,324
- Hi, hey.

339
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,982
- God, security wasn't
like this on the field trip

340
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:34,119
to the dairy farm.

341
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,901
- Oh well it's the alien spacecraft.

342
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:38,538
We keep it in the basement.

343
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:40,218
- It was a joke, Agent Mulder.

344
00:21:40,218 --> 00:21:42,842
- There is truth behind every joke.

345
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:43,839
- [Woman] John Carver, please come to

346
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,115
the third floor conference hall.

347
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:46,067
- Uh oh.

348
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:46,900
- [Woman] John Carver, please--

349
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,757
- Bad news?

350
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:48,760
- We'll see.

351
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,158
I'll catch up with you later, alright?

352
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:52,334
Go on, get up there.

353
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:54,501
(beeping)

354
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:57,960
(whistling)

355
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,044
(buzzes)

356
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,215
(beeping)

357
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:01,653
(whistling)

358
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,076
(buzzes)

359
00:22:04,076 --> 00:22:05,633
Wrong.

360
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:08,555
(beeping)

361
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:09,931
(whistling)

362
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:11,931
(beeps)

363
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:17,371
- We've reached the
halfway point in our tour.

364
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:20,955
The public relations liaison
will be right with you.

365
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:21,788
Come.

366
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,523
Come on.

367
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:27,971
Please have a seat.

368
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,638
Somebody will be right with you.

369
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,635
- Hi Andy.

370
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:45,894
- Hi.
- You know, I knew

371
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:49,644
you were our connection
the minute I saw you.

372
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:53,092
- What is he talking about?

373
00:22:53,092 --> 00:22:53,925
- The UFO.

374
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:55,931
- Huh?

375
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:58,329
- Reverse engineering of
alien technology Andy,

376
00:22:58,329 --> 00:22:59,849
that's what we're talking about.

377
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,250
Now that guy you were talking to?

378
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,291
- My stepdad.

379
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,193
- Oh good, good, good,
then you guys are close.

380
00:23:06,193 --> 00:23:08,651
What kind of information
can you get out of him?

381
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:10,850
Come on Andy, don't play
coy with us, we know

382
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,517
what's going on here,
we've heard the rumors.

383
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,734
VectroComp has connections
with every black ops division

384
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:17,275
in this government.

385
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:18,955
I mean everybody knows
that they were behind

386
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:21,115
the disappearance of
those kids four years ago.

387
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:23,313
- You know, down by Lake Cloverfield,

388
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:26,230
the secret government installation?

389
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:27,989
- Right.

390
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:30,469
- I've been down there.

391
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:32,894
All I've seen is an old
abandoned power plant.

392
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:37,061
Oh, you mean the secret
old abandoned power plant.

393
00:23:38,414 --> 00:23:40,115
That's where my stepdad sells human women

394
00:23:40,115 --> 00:23:41,694
to the alien overlords.

395
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:42,734
(laughing)

396
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:46,371
(mocking laughter)

397
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,034
- Laugh while you can, monkey boy.

398
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:50,595
The power plant is just a coverup.

399
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,211
Everything's underground.

400
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:55,071
Talking about miles and
miles, subterranean caverns,

401
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:57,054
underground tunnels.

402
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,395
Probably connected to this place even.

403
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:03,372
Why don't you ask you
stepdad about the spy?

404
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:05,075
- The spy?
- Oh!

405
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:06,131
Yeah.

406
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:08,814
Rumor has it that one of
the seven new employees here

407
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:13,534
at VectroComp is not
exactly what he seems to be.

408
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:14,553
(dramatic music)

409
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,668
- It's fragile Andy, I'll get it.

410
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:21,155
I just don't want you to
touch any unlabeled boxes.

411
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:23,488
(whistling)

412
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:28,909
- Corporate espionage, Andy.

413
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:34,289
- Are you guys up for some exploring?

414
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:35,633
- Maybe you didn't see our name tags?

415
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,633
They say limited access.

416
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,007
- [Andy] Come on.

417
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:45,803
- Hey loser, where are you going?

418
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:47,238
- Hey, who cares?

419
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:50,155
(mysterious music)

420
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,292
- It's a code lock, what now?

421
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:09,617
(beeping)

422
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,950
(whistling)

423
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:15,158
(beeps)

424
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:20,134
- Did I mention that you rock?

425
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:29,932
- You know I just, I don't
know where to go from here.

426
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:32,075
You're leading us in circles, Boyd.

427
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:35,173
Why can't I shake the
feeling that you simply

428
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:39,297
don't have the slightest
idea what the problem is?

429
00:25:39,297 --> 00:25:41,494
- I do know what the problem is, Malcolm.

430
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:43,494
The crystal is unstable.

431
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:46,475
- Yes, I understand,
you've been telling me that

432
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:48,058
for three days now.

433
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:51,087
Are you with us, John?

434
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,383
- Sorry Malcolm.

435
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:05,138
(mysterious music)

436
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:21,403
- I'm sorry.

437
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:27,362
I shouldn't be apologizing
to you, both of you.

438
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:30,061
Been pushing too hard.

439
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:32,464
Somebody's looking over
our shoulder on this one.

440
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:34,131
It's got me on edge.

441
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:37,247
We need a solution.

442
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:41,061
Which is why I'm putting you in charge

443
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:42,811
of the project, John.

444
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:47,695
It's time for a new vision.

445
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:52,544
We'll go back to diagnostics,
we're going to run

446
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,127
that program again.

447
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,506
(mysterious music)

448
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,450
- [Sam] We're gonna get caught.

449
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,950
- Don't worry about it, relax.

450
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:20,687
- Okay what now brain boy?

451
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:21,727
No way is it gonna be
the same code we used

452
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,810
to get into the corridor.

453
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:27,036
(beeping)

454
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:31,889
(whistling)

455
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:33,889
(beeps)

456
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:36,342
- Whoa.

457
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,534
- Oh yeah, awesome.

458
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:50,187
- Hey, check this out.

459
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:55,011
We became outlaws for
this lame Star Trek prop?

460
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:58,153
- Hey, there's nothing
lame about Star Trek.

461
00:27:58,153 --> 00:28:00,414
The original series.

462
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:01,934
- There's gotta be something
cool about the glasses,

463
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:04,334
otherwise why all the security?

464
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:05,913
- To throw people like us off the trail

465
00:28:05,913 --> 00:28:07,493
of what really goes on here.

466
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:10,910
All we've gotta do is find the right lab.

467
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:16,400
(beeping)

468
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:20,632
- Dark Side of the Moon.

469
00:28:33,454 --> 00:28:36,454
(keyboard clicking)

470
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:39,204
- What are you doing?

471
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:41,491
- This should be--

472
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:42,771
- Andy, I don't think you should--

473
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:43,870
- Look come on, you're gonna

474
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,787
get us all landed in jail, alright?

475
00:28:50,553 --> 00:28:52,636
- This should be a three.

476
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,073
Three.

477
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:58,240
(beeping)

478
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,343
- Whoa.

479
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:06,186
Awesome.

480
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,242
(beeping)

481
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:11,640
(whistles)

482
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
(beeps)

483
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:16,522
- After you.

484
00:29:19,982 --> 00:29:21,815
- Get away from there!

485
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:25,285
What do you think you're doing?

486
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:29,160
- How'd you get in here, Andy?

487
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,516
- You know this young man?

488
00:29:30,516 --> 00:29:32,016
- He's my stepson.

489
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,523
- Well you better have a good lawyer

490
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,424
because I am calling security.

491
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:39,701
- Hold it, hold it.

492
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:40,534
Hold on.

493
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:43,823
You're not calling anyone, Boyd.

494
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:44,656
- But--

495
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:45,489
- John.

496
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:48,624
Take a look.

497
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:55,112
- Malcolm, it works.

498
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:56,939
- Yes.

499
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,066
- What did you do?

500
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,405
- Well I, there was a
slight error in the math.

501
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:06,262
An eight instead of a three.

502
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,921
It must have been a typo.

503
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:10,921
- Like this kid can correct my math.

504
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:13,736
- I'm afraid he has.

505
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,280
Would you like to take a look?

506
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:23,814
Alright.

507
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:33,291
- Oh here, Andy, use the remote.

508
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,261
Now push right here, controls
the level of the x-ray.

509
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:41,428
- [Andy] Whoa.

510
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:43,915
Cool.

511
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:48,815
Oh yeah.

512
00:30:50,422 --> 00:30:51,962
Man.

513
00:30:51,962 --> 00:30:54,295
- Hey, whoa there super boy!

514
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,824
- Alright, alright.

515
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,320
There.

516
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,358
Like 'em?

517
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:02,442
- Are you kidding?

518
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:06,224
- Boyd, I want these locked in the vault.

519
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:09,024
No one signs them out without
my permission, understood?

520
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:09,857
- Yes sir.

521
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:16,805
- Let's take the afternoon
off to celebrate.

522
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:20,421
Then we'll get to work
refining the controls,

523
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:23,664
especially the cloaking system.

524
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:26,421
Young man, while I certainly don't approve

525
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:29,161
of the way you went about
it, you've made a major

526
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:32,842
breakthrough for us and I thank you.

527
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:36,100
Now I'm afraid it's
time you got your butts

528
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,933
out of my top security laboratory.

529
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,776
(mysterious music)

530
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,515
- I forgot my backpack.

531
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:20,028
- [Boyd] Forget something?

532
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:23,195
- Thanks.

533
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:44,698
- Let me guess, they caused
some kind of trouble.

534
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:46,698
- Oh no no, far from it.

535
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:48,434
- Sam.

536
00:32:52,885 --> 00:32:53,885
- Come here.

537
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,320
Andy, you know I find
myself strangely torn.

538
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,877
You broke into a top secret facility.

539
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:05,939
Last time I checked, that
fell in the category of bad.

540
00:33:05,939 --> 00:33:06,772
Oh man.

541
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,551
But I am proud of you.

542
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,493
See you tonight.

543
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,847
- Okay, moms go rest, nine
year olds get ready for bed.

544
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:38,814
- Go.

545
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:42,382
- Scientists and spies do the dishes.

546
00:33:42,382 --> 00:33:43,215
Come on.

547
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,793
- Well.

548
00:33:49,262 --> 00:33:51,059
Guess we'd better get to
it, especially with all

549
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,559
the unpacking we've got to do.

550
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:55,791
Oh.

551
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:03,128
(dog barking)

552
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,712
(sighs)

553
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:08,212
So I'll wash, you dry, okay?
- Okay, okay.

554
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,170
John?
- Yeah?

555
00:34:15,947 --> 00:34:19,697
- Why do you always keep
the basement locked?

556
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:23,395
- Well I got some equipment down there.

557
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,455
You know those boxes I
asked you not to mess with.

558
00:34:27,455 --> 00:34:29,279
- What kind of a equipment?

559
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:31,932
- I'll show you when I get
it all unpacked, alright?

560
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:35,682
Hey, grab those dishes
over there, would you?

561
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,880
- Honey, I'm home.

562
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,520
(gentle music)

563
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,758
Hello dear.

564
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:54,339
- I didn't hear you come in.

565
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,760
- I've got some news.

566
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,099
The glasses.

567
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:58,932
They work.

568
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:03,638
It's only a matter of
time before we refine them

569
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:07,219
so that they work across
the entire spectrum.

570
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:11,386
And then I'm going to take
you outside and show you

571
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,433
the world.

572
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:16,419
What do you think about that?

573
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:17,416
(laughing)

574
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,999
- [Wife] Wonderful.

575
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,190
(dramatic music)

576
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,643
- Why don't you just cut
a path with a chainsaw,

577
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,476
might make less noise?

578
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:47,992
- Lieutenant Biddle.

579
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:50,075
- Give me some good news.

580
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:53,556
Alright, let's change our tactic then.

581
00:35:53,556 --> 00:35:55,560
Give me any news.

582
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,615
- Glasses work and I managed
to smuggle them out of the lab.

583
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,782
- And the cloaking device?

584
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,814
- Let's just say that it's not 100%.

585
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:08,558
- Let's have them.

586
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:10,680
- You see that's where we
get into this whole gray area

587
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,819
between good news and just news.

588
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:14,078
(sighs)

589
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:16,219
- I am beginning to think that
you were put on this earth

590
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:18,878
expressly to punish me!

591
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:22,418
Take a stab at the gray area, Mr. Russell.

592
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:24,040
- A kid has them.

593
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,873
- A kid?

594
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,702
- It's not just a kid, it's the son, well,

595
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:32,638
it's the stepson of the new
scientist at VectroComp.

596
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:34,200
See I used him as a mule
to smuggle the glasses

597
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,342
out of the lab but he's also
the reason that the cloaking

598
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:40,298
device hasn't been perfected.

599
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,558
I deliberately screwed
up the math that controls

600
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:45,422
the shield of the prism inside the glasses

601
00:36:45,422 --> 00:36:46,942
to buy more time to work on the cloak

602
00:36:46,942 --> 00:36:51,109
and then this punk kid comes
in and corrects my math.

603
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,793
Oh I'm glad you're amused by this.

604
00:36:55,758 --> 00:36:58,099
- Oh far from it, Mr. Russell.

605
00:36:58,099 --> 00:36:59,915
You know very well the
success of our mission

606
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,499
depends on that cloaking device.

607
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:05,422
I could care less about the x-ray vision,

608
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:08,589
the military applications are minimal.

609
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:14,629
But invisibility, now
there's an offensive weapon.

610
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:19,960
And since you failed
so miserably to develop

611
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,278
the technology on your own,
I risk personal discovery

612
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:25,582
to set you up at VectroComp
so you could simply

613
00:37:25,582 --> 00:37:27,678
steal what we need!

614
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,928
And you failed at that too!

615
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,673
- Not yet.

616
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:36,419
- Use what has been
given you, Mr. Russell.

617
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:38,419
The boy, his stepfather,

618
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:45,022
and bring me those glasses.

619
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:47,689
(ominous music)

620
00:38:02,376 --> 00:38:05,293
- Back soon Mom, going to the park.

621
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:39,913
- [Grode] Yo Ritchie,
check out who's coming.

622
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:42,330
(rock music)

623
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:45,258
(laughs)

624
00:38:56,936 --> 00:39:00,979
- Well well well, if it
ain't Robbie Knievel, huh.

625
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:03,176
- Hey Moe, hey Curly.

626
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:06,099
- That's funny, we're the two stooges.

627
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:09,817
You gonna put on another
daredevil thrill show for us?

628
00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:11,758
Impress the girls?

629
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:12,591
- Why not?

630
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,440
- Think you can jump the bear?

631
00:39:25,635 --> 00:39:28,259
- Oh come on, even you
could jump the bear.

632
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,096
- You're just a laugh riot, aren't you?

633
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:33,319
- Grode, make a ramp.

634
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,152
- Okay.

635
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,803
- [Richie] Come on, you chicken.

636
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:39,803
(mimicking chicken)

637
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:55,591
(laughing)

638
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:03,224
- Hey, don't worry, there's
a payphone down the street

639
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:05,891
and we'll call you an ambulance.

640
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:09,746
(mimicking chicken)

641
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,262
(shouting)

642
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,542
(laughing)

643
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,136
- Oh man!

644
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:27,997
- Woo, come on let's go
to the Crunchy Freeze.

645
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:29,394
Grode's buying.

646
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,561
- Oh, you bet.

647
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,433
Come on, let's go.

648
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,151
- [Richie] Shotgun!

649
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,150
- Oh no.

650
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,235
This is not good.

651
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,064
(dramatic music)

652
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,070
Wow.

653
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:48,227
Whoa.

654
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:59,222
- This oughta be like
taking candy from a baby.

655
00:41:59,222 --> 00:42:00,055
- Oh man.

656
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:28,974
- You know what?

657
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:31,342
I think I'm beginning
to get a clear picture

658
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:34,302
of what this alien abduction
stuff is all about.

659
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,265
The Kennedy assassination.

660
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:37,098
- Wait a minute.

661
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:37,931
- Oh no no no no.

662
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,430
Extraterrestrials, the
grays, were in league

663
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,769
with Kennedy's rivals in the government,

664
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,209
not to mention, you know, the mafia.

665
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,569
I've been over and over this,
it's finally obvious to me

666
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:46,187
that Lee Harvey Oswald and
Jack Ruby were both abductees.

667
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:47,867
Ruby killed Oswald to
prevent him from revealing

668
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:49,947
the alien implant in his brain.

669
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:52,849
The same implant that
transmitted the extraterrestrial,

670
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:57,016
you know, signal ordering Oswald
to kill President Kennedy.

671
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,325
- [Andy] Guys!

672
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:00,575
- Oh thank god.

673
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:04,759
Finally.

674
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,566
- Some frequency, Kenneth.

675
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:11,649
- You guys aren't gonna believe this.

676
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:17,193
- You stole the glasses?

677
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:18,974
He stole the glasses.
- Andy!

678
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:20,367
- Boyd, Boyd, Boyd--
- He stole the glasses!

679
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,849
- Boyd, in my backpack.

680
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,051
I need to talk to you guys, just--

681
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:25,411
- Oh no no no oh no.

682
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:27,113
I'm not going to jail for you, Andy.

683
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:30,435
- Come here, come on.
- Alright.

684
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:31,491
- Look, Boyd, he must
have slipped the glasses

685
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:34,275
in my backpack and I think
that my stepdad's involved too.

686
00:43:34,275 --> 00:43:35,568
- That's crazy!

687
00:43:35,568 --> 00:43:37,411
- I know, but something's going on.

688
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:40,078
(ominous music)

689
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:45,734
There's some shady action
going on in the basement.

690
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:47,734
He keeps it locked and
acted very suspicious

691
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:49,195
when I asked him about it.

692
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:53,051
- Has he ever been abducted by aliens?

693
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:55,115
Okay, alright fine.

694
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,454
Let's take the investigative approach.

695
00:43:56,454 --> 00:43:58,009
What would your dad and this guy Boyd

696
00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:00,571
want with some goofy looking glasses?

697
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,731
- I dunno, they want to join Devo.

698
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:04,372
- Would you stop making jokes Andy?

699
00:44:04,372 --> 00:44:06,475
This is serious!

700
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:08,892
- Better listen to him, Andy.

701
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:13,303
This is very serious.

702
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:17,494
Just give me the glasses, Andy.

703
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:19,014
I'll see to it the
authorities never find out

704
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:21,611
what your stepfather has done.

705
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:22,694
Come on Andy.

706
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,611
Just give me the glasses.

707
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:28,444
Andy.

708
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:30,908
Andy.

709
00:44:32,614 --> 00:44:34,710
Gimme the glasses!

710
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,210
- [Iris] Run, run!

711
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:38,660
- [Sam] I got him, I got him, I got him.

712
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,410
(dramatic music)

713
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:06,046
- Alright kid, you made your decision.

714
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,876
I hope you like not having a father.

715
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:27,856
- Wait wait wait wait.

716
00:45:27,856 --> 00:45:29,860
What's going on?

717
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,378
Uh oh, this is not good.

718
00:45:32,378 --> 00:45:33,796
- Why don't you put the
glasses on and find out

719
00:45:33,796 --> 00:45:35,536
what's going on inside?

720
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:37,536
(snaps)

721
00:45:48,799 --> 00:45:52,397
- I see about five or six figures.

722
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:54,230
I think that's my mom.

723
00:45:56,485 --> 00:45:58,136
- Andy?

724
00:45:58,136 --> 00:46:00,602
- What?
(buzzing)

725
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:01,769
- The glasses.

726
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:07,473
They're, uh, they're gone.

727
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:13,204
- Then why am I counting your ribs?

728
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:14,202
- No, I'm telling you,

729
00:46:14,202 --> 00:46:16,619
they're completely invisible.

730
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:22,321
- Hey, I can't get 'em loose.

731
00:46:26,439 --> 00:46:27,272
Oh no!

732
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,677
This is not good.

733
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:37,324
They're taking John away.

734
00:46:37,324 --> 00:46:38,741
This is not good.

735
00:46:57,884 --> 00:46:59,534
What are we gonna do?

736
00:46:59,534 --> 00:47:00,367
- I dunno.

737
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:03,024
- Guys guys guys guys!

738
00:47:03,024 --> 00:47:06,764
Hey guys, I was afraid that
Boyd had caught you guys!

739
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:08,040
- They arrested John.

740
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,127
- What?

741
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:12,084
- Yeah, and the glasses,
they're invisible.

742
00:47:12,084 --> 00:47:14,584
- And I can't get 'em off my face.

743
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:16,167
- No.

744
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,164
- Oh great.

745
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:19,404
What else could possibly go wrong?

746
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:20,461
- Look, just give me the remote and maybe

747
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:23,322
we can power them down and
I can reverse the process.

748
00:47:23,322 --> 00:47:24,155
- Yeah.

749
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:31,868
- Uh oh.

750
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:33,367
- What do you mean uh oh!

751
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:34,941
Sam!

752
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:36,044
Jeez!

753
00:47:36,044 --> 00:47:37,877
- I must have lost it.

754
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,567
- Let's go let's go.
- God!

755
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:51,584
- Okay look, whatever's
causing this invisibility

756
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:54,685
must be creating some
kind of magnetic field.

757
00:47:54,685 --> 00:47:56,528
- Are you saying that my head is magnetic?

758
00:47:56,528 --> 00:47:57,726
- Okay who am I, Spock?

759
00:47:57,726 --> 00:47:59,740
I don't know how these things work!

760
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,990
(groaning)

761
00:48:10,528 --> 00:48:12,528
- I can see in the basement.

762
00:48:12,528 --> 00:48:14,325
- What is it?

763
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,608
- It's real hard to make out.

764
00:48:16,608 --> 00:48:18,747
I'm kinda seeing through it too.

765
00:48:18,747 --> 00:48:21,580
It looks like lab equipment maybe.

766
00:48:24,624 --> 00:48:26,208
We're gonna have to break in.

767
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:29,208
We gotta see what John's been up to.

768
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:36,069
- So that's where you went.

769
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,665
I'm always losing the remote.

770
00:48:47,644 --> 00:48:51,867
- Perhaps I should pursue
a career in criminal arts.

771
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:53,408
- Guys?

772
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:57,325
- Alright, you tell me,
what is all this stuff?

773
00:49:06,608 --> 00:49:09,525
(mysterious music)

774
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:15,837
- Whoa.

775
00:49:29,728 --> 00:49:32,507
- It's your birthday present.

776
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:36,090
Your dad was gonna
build you a science lab.

777
00:49:52,048 --> 00:49:54,384
- I didn't do it, Malcolm.

778
00:49:54,384 --> 00:49:56,325
You have to know that.

779
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:57,158
- Do I?

780
00:49:59,894 --> 00:50:02,727
I've known you about a week, John.

781
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:05,317
Our people are put
through the most intense

782
00:50:05,317 --> 00:50:09,624
security measures
possible, but maybe, maybe

783
00:50:09,624 --> 00:50:11,982
you slipped past us.

784
00:50:11,982 --> 00:50:15,420
I'm afraid I don't know
what kind of a man you are.

785
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,420
What I do know is that your stepson,

786
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:24,835
a 15 year old boy, somehow
managed to break into

787
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:28,778
a high securance laboratory,
a lab that you know

788
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:30,528
the entrance code to.

789
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:35,720
And while in that lab, he
was able to solve a problem

790
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,470
that's been plaguing
this project for months.

791
00:50:41,523 --> 00:50:44,606
And now that project has been stolen.

792
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,717
I didn't design those
x-ray glasses because

793
00:50:57,717 --> 00:51:01,884
I wanted to change the world,
John, or to give the military

794
00:51:02,723 --> 00:51:04,556
some swell new weapon.

795
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:11,146
My wife has been blind
since she was a little girl.

796
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:16,142
My hope is that the
technology can be improved

797
00:51:16,142 --> 00:51:19,975
to the point that she'll
be able to see again.

798
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:40,070
- I can't believe I lost the remote.

799
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,232
I'm such a loser.

800
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,910
- I'm not just a loser,
I'm a big suck loser.

801
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,809
- You know if there were
a royal family of losers

802
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,448
we would be the inbred mutants

803
00:51:49,448 --> 00:51:50,887
forced to live in the basement.

804
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:52,005
- Yeah and eat rats.

805
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:53,348
- Mm hmm.

806
00:51:53,348 --> 00:51:55,759
- Man cry me a river.

807
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:56,767
Look.

808
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:59,550
We can either sit here and
whine or do something about it.

809
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,550
- Mm, whine.

810
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:07,945
- It's almost time for Buffy.

811
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:11,119
(buzzing)

812
00:52:13,571 --> 00:52:14,872
(shouts)

813
00:52:14,872 --> 00:52:16,346
- Hey!

814
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:17,672
- What is it?

815
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:20,505
- The effect, it's getting weaker.

816
00:52:21,752 --> 00:52:23,687
Your flesh and muscles are coming back.

817
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:27,408
- Hey, don't go exploring, Columbus.

818
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:30,728
(buzzes)
(shouts)

819
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:34,670
- The effect, it's getting stronger now!

820
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,420
It's freaking me out!

821
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:40,312
- I think someone's using the remote.

822
00:52:40,312 --> 00:52:43,512
- Maybe the person who's
using it is still in the park.

823
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:45,811
- Alright look, sit down in
here, just stay here okay,

824
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:46,644
we'll be back in a few minutes.

825
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:48,144
Alright, let's go.

826
00:52:49,702 --> 00:52:52,304
- I can see through my eyelids!

827
00:52:52,304 --> 00:52:55,304
(suspenseful music)

828
00:52:57,777 --> 00:52:59,444
- Come on, this way.

829
00:53:09,502 --> 00:53:12,464
- I can see through my eyelids.

830
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:13,297
Stop this!

831
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:15,415
Oh.

832
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,613
(groaning and shouting)

833
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,107
- [Sam] Where is it?

834
00:54:05,605 --> 00:54:07,104
- Man am I an idiot.

835
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:10,221
The solution has been right
in front of me the whole time!

836
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:11,643
All I've gotta do is go
see Malcolm and tell him

837
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:12,966
what happened.

838
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:15,883
(mysterious music)

839
00:54:22,523 --> 00:54:23,356
Wow.

840
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:40,542
(doorbell rings)

841
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,709
- Hello, is someone there?

842
00:54:48,564 --> 00:54:49,397
Yes?

843
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:52,506
- Um, hi, is Malcolm in?

844
00:54:54,122 --> 00:54:55,743
- No I'm sorry, he's not.

845
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,829
He had some business to take care of.

846
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,668
- Could you tell him that
Andy Carver came by please?

847
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:04,192
- Of course.

848
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:08,359
- Tell him that I have
something that belongs to him.

849
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,373
- Is there anything else?

850
00:55:16,182 --> 00:55:17,515
- No, thank you.

851
00:55:20,658 --> 00:55:23,241
- [Wife] Okay then, good night.

852
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:30,495
- Did you find it?
- No.

853
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:34,962
Alright look, if you were a
remote, where would you be?

854
00:55:34,962 --> 00:55:36,704
- Definitely not in this forest.

855
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:38,621
- I can't believe this.

856
00:55:49,163 --> 00:55:51,381
Just forget it, okay, just forget it.

857
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,131
I'm a loser, alright?

858
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:56,302
- And the fact that you lost the remote?

859
00:55:56,302 --> 00:55:57,135
Yeah.

860
00:55:57,984 --> 00:56:01,461
Otherwise, you're a
perfectly acceptable guy.

861
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:03,564
So knock off that loser stuff.

862
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:04,967
I mean, don't get me wrong, I still think

863
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:07,024
you're certifiably insane.

864
00:56:07,024 --> 00:56:09,819
(dramatic music)

865
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:10,652
Duck!

866
00:56:10,652 --> 00:56:11,902
Duck duck duck!

867
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:14,241
Boyd.

868
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:16,074
What does he want now?

869
00:56:17,063 --> 00:56:20,167
- Maybe he's got the remote.

870
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:21,417
Okay, let's go.

871
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:31,809
- I have some good news and I have some,

872
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:33,268
well I don't know what the good news is,

873
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:34,435
but I have it.

874
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:40,447
Lieutenant Biddle, how are you?

875
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,450
- Let's cut the niceties.

876
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,991
News, good, bad, whatever.

877
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:45,329
- I set up the stepfather.

878
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:47,111
He's sitting in a jail cell right now

879
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,111
and that should buy us some time.

880
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:51,910
- You were actually doing
pretty well until you said that.

881
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,649
You don't have the glasses.

882
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:55,671
- The kid still has them.

883
00:56:55,671 --> 00:56:57,191
You want some good news?

884
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:59,009
The cloaking device works.

885
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:01,249
The bad news is we haven't
been able to make it work right

886
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:04,209
which means the glasses are
bonded to the kid's face

887
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:06,344
unless of course we can
wire him to a computer

888
00:57:06,344 --> 00:57:09,292
and shut 'em down using
the failsafe codes.

889
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,452
- And that's why you haven't
brought the glasses to me yet?

890
00:57:11,452 --> 00:57:15,619
You're still not thinking
these things through, are you?

891
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:18,844
- What do you want from me?

892
00:57:18,844 --> 00:57:22,108
The glasses are stuck to the kid's head.

893
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:24,691
- Then bring me the kid's head.

894
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:33,771
- We better go get Andy.

895
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:41,788
Look, he made that easy.

896
00:57:41,788 --> 00:57:42,892
- [Sam] Oh my god, what's he doing here?

897
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:43,948
He's supposed to stay at home.

898
00:57:43,948 --> 00:57:45,365
- [Iris] I dunno.

899
00:57:47,102 --> 00:57:47,935
- Andy!

900
00:57:49,662 --> 00:57:51,843
- I'm at one with the universe!

901
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,477
- Wow, he's totally freaking out.

902
00:57:53,477 --> 00:57:56,302
- Andy, Andy, Andy are
you alright, you okay?

903
00:57:56,302 --> 00:57:58,046
- I can see the eye of god.

904
00:57:58,046 --> 00:58:01,123
- Andy, that's the Texaco sign.

905
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:02,825
- Okay, alright Andy, Andy, come on,

906
00:58:02,825 --> 00:58:04,286
it's time to snap out of it, okay?

907
00:58:04,286 --> 00:58:05,625
Pull yourself together, come on!

908
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:07,806
- These glasses are freaking me out!

909
00:58:07,806 --> 00:58:10,446
Hey, are you slapping me?

910
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:12,206
- Look, Boyd is gonna do
a lot worse than slap you

911
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:14,580
if we don't get those
glasses off your face.

912
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,999
- No but you heard him, we can't do that

913
00:58:15,999 --> 00:58:17,465
unless we hook him up
to the computer again.

914
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,338
- [Iris] What about the lab?

915
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:21,102
- Oh, okay, yeah great,
great, let's just break into

916
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:22,985
VectroComp again, that's a good one.

917
00:58:22,985 --> 00:58:24,941
- No no no, the lab in Andy's basement.

918
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:27,406
Why don't we just make a new remote?

919
00:58:27,406 --> 00:58:29,260
- Wait, we can do that?

920
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,093
- I don't see why not.

921
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:30,926
Come on, let's go!

922
00:58:30,926 --> 00:58:33,843
- Hey guys, guys, help me, help me.

923
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,661
(mysterious music)

924
00:58:42,116 --> 00:58:43,199
On the shelf.

925
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:49,657
- Come on baby, where are you?

926
00:58:49,657 --> 00:58:50,574
Ah, gotcha.

927
00:58:51,544 --> 00:58:53,560
Universal TV remote.

928
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,310
We'll see about that.

929
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:57,017
- Huh.

930
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
(machines whirring)

931
00:59:19,763 --> 00:59:22,301
- Alright, screwdriver.

932
00:59:22,301 --> 00:59:23,134
- Check.

933
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:32,861
- [Sam] Soldering iron.

934
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:33,694
- Check.

935
00:59:45,384 --> 00:59:47,717
- Various electronic gizmos.

936
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:53,272
- Check?

937
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:58,470
- Brow.

938
01:00:01,224 --> 01:00:02,057
Brow.

939
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,353
- Check.

940
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,593
- Ah.

941
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:32,857
Right tools for the right job.

942
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:35,524
- Right tools for the right job.

943
01:00:37,223 --> 01:00:39,425
- You know it actually
looks like a model car

944
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:42,881
I built in the fifth grade
and subsequently blew up

945
01:00:42,881 --> 01:00:44,503
with an M80.

946
01:00:44,503 --> 01:00:46,753
- This is never gonna work.

947
01:00:50,678 --> 01:00:52,966
- Could you be a little
bit more optimistic please?

948
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:53,799
- Shh.

949
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:03,982
Did you guys hear something?

950
01:01:10,507 --> 01:01:12,424
- I can't see anything.

951
01:01:17,926 --> 01:01:22,093
- Alright, let's start with
turning off the cloaking device.

952
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:23,762
Yeah?

953
01:01:26,689 --> 01:01:30,856
(buzzing)
(crying out)

954
01:01:32,507 --> 01:01:33,905
Okay okay okay okay okay.

955
01:01:33,905 --> 01:01:37,884
So what I meant to say was
I'll decrease the level

956
01:01:37,884 --> 01:01:39,551
of the x-ray effect.

957
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:45,985
- It's working.

958
01:01:45,985 --> 01:01:47,068
It's working!

959
01:01:50,609 --> 01:01:52,327
It's working!

960
01:01:52,327 --> 01:01:53,244
- Shh, shh!

961
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:03,035
(suspenseful music)

962
01:02:03,035 --> 01:02:06,176
Okay, maybe I'm just nuts,
but I think there's something

963
01:02:06,176 --> 01:02:08,028
creepy going on upstairs.

964
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:10,495
- What do you mean, like
parents making out creepy

965
01:02:10,495 --> 01:02:14,078
or like serial killers
on the loose creepy?

966
01:02:20,732 --> 01:02:23,355
- There's definitely something up there.

967
01:02:23,355 --> 01:02:25,493
It could be a cat but
the glasses are really

968
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,296
out of control.

969
01:02:27,296 --> 01:02:28,432
- That's no problem.

970
01:02:28,432 --> 01:02:29,452
(bleeps)

971
01:02:29,452 --> 01:02:31,551
Captain, please turn the phasers on stun.

972
01:02:31,551 --> 01:02:33,093
(bleeps)

973
01:02:33,093 --> 01:02:33,926
- Come on.

974
01:02:36,293 --> 01:02:38,214
(buzzes)
(cries out)

975
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:39,275
- [Andy] What'd you do?

976
01:02:39,275 --> 01:02:40,555
- Same thing I did last
time, didn't it work?

977
01:02:40,555 --> 01:02:41,489
- [Andy] You zapped me.

978
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:42,322
- Shh!

979
01:02:42,322 --> 01:02:43,155
Shh!

980
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:52,312
Am I the only one who is
a little bit concerned

981
01:02:52,312 --> 01:02:56,009
about the cat or whatever it is upstairs?

982
01:02:56,009 --> 01:02:58,414
- You're not really
afraid of a cat, are you?

983
01:02:58,414 --> 01:03:00,813
- He said it might be a cat.

984
01:03:00,813 --> 01:03:02,563
Operative word might.

985
01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:06,151
- There's definitely
something up in the carport.

986
01:03:06,151 --> 01:03:08,612
If it is a cat, it's really big.

987
01:03:08,612 --> 01:03:09,614
- Like how big?

988
01:03:09,614 --> 01:03:10,612
- Who cares?

989
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:12,532
Look, we know that the
remote control works

990
01:03:12,532 --> 01:03:15,652
so I say we play with it later.

991
01:03:15,652 --> 01:03:18,251
Come on, out the window,
better safe than sorry

992
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:19,334
I always say.

993
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:23,459
- I've never heard you say that before.

994
01:03:37,796 --> 01:03:38,841
Here here here, let me
dial it down some more.

995
01:03:38,841 --> 01:03:40,605
(buzzes)
- Ow, you shocked me!

996
01:03:40,605 --> 01:03:42,159
- Wait wait wait.

997
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:45,492
Okay, let's go over what we're gonna do.

998
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:48,282
So what's the plan?

999
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,841
- We take the fight to them.

1000
01:03:50,841 --> 01:03:54,602
- Oh, and the insane guy
says take the fight to them.

1001
01:03:54,602 --> 01:03:57,583
And everybody laughed and laughed.

1002
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,039
- We've got to go out
to the old power plant.

1003
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,400
I mean with the x-ray
glasses I can find the secret

1004
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,856
entrance to the base.

1005
01:04:01,856 --> 01:04:03,381
Maybe then we can find
the information we need

1006
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:07,214
to shut these guys down
and clear John's name.

1007
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:11,103
- Hey!

1008
01:04:22,213 --> 01:04:25,757
Wanna make this interesting, huh?

1009
01:04:25,757 --> 01:04:27,007
Okay I'll play.

1010
01:04:28,557 --> 01:04:29,390
I'll play.

1011
01:04:35,064 --> 01:04:36,717
- Richie, we're not supposed to be here,

1012
01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:38,195
it's government property.

1013
01:04:38,195 --> 01:04:40,695
- Nobody tells me where to go.

1014
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:49,746
- Guys guys guys.

1015
01:04:49,746 --> 01:04:51,066
I can't do it.

1016
01:04:51,066 --> 01:04:52,080
- What?

1017
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,163
- I can't, I can't go on.

1018
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,093
- [Andy] Why not?

1019
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,778
- Do you even know what's out there?

1020
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:02,922
I'm telling you, more than
the truth is out there.

1021
01:05:02,922 --> 01:05:05,642
Okay scary stuff is out there, alright?

1022
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:08,199
- Look, Sam, we've been
friends a long time, right?

1023
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:09,200
- Yeah.

1024
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,082
- Wasn't it me who comforted
you when you found out

1025
01:05:11,082 --> 01:05:13,340
your sea monkeys couldn't drive Cadillacs?

1026
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,173
- Yes.

1027
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,978
- And wasn't it me who
calmed you down right after

1028
01:05:17,978 --> 01:05:20,181
you found out that your ant
farm would never grow crops?

1029
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:21,014
- Yes.

1030
01:05:23,016 --> 01:05:26,122
- And wasn't it me who saved
you from extreme embarrassment

1031
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,920
by pointing out that
the middle kid in Hanson

1032
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,681
is a boy not a girl and that
maybe it wasn't a good idea

1033
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:33,264
to send him a mushy fan letter?

1034
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:36,560
The main thing is that
I'm your friend Sam,

1035
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,042
and I'm not going to let
anything happen to you

1036
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:40,181
that wouldn't happen to us.

1037
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:41,415
Right Andy?

1038
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:44,080
- Couldn't have said it better myself.

1039
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,378
- Alright, okay, point taken.

1040
01:05:46,378 --> 01:05:48,602
Alright, you're right.

1041
01:05:48,602 --> 01:05:49,435
Let's go.

1042
01:05:55,221 --> 01:05:57,721
(owl hooting)

1043
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:01,994
- Hold it, hold it.

1044
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:03,653
Got two bogeys.

1045
01:06:03,653 --> 01:06:06,090
- That just sounds gross.

1046
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:08,533
- 10 o'clock, behind the oak tree.

1047
01:06:08,533 --> 01:06:12,700
Two males, teenagers, maybe,
I think it's Richie and Grode.

1048
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:18,710
- That's just fabulous.

1049
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,413
You think they been following us?

1050
01:06:21,413 --> 01:06:23,653
- Initiate plan B.

1051
01:06:23,653 --> 01:06:24,730
- Right.

1052
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,994
- Plan B?

1053
01:06:25,994 --> 01:06:27,994
What the heck is plan B?

1054
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,114
Okay that's for leaving
me out of that one guys,

1055
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:32,197
that's great.

1056
01:06:39,391 --> 01:06:42,431
(shouting)

1057
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,681
(laughing)

1058
01:06:46,298 --> 01:06:48,634
- Nice boxer shorts, Richie.

1059
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:50,170
Mama's little stinker?

1060
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,246
- It's laundry day.

1061
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:55,663
Hey, how did you know what I was wearing?

1062
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:58,411
- My god.

1063
01:06:58,411 --> 01:07:00,369
- You freak, I'm gonna pummel you.

1064
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:02,314
- You know you're trespassing here.

1065
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:03,690
This is government property.

1066
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,493
We can have you arrested.

1067
01:07:05,493 --> 01:07:07,013
- Yeah?

1068
01:07:07,013 --> 01:07:08,427
- Yeah.

1069
01:07:08,427 --> 01:07:10,053
- Why don't you go do that then.

1070
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:11,674
Why don't you tell the
president of the school board

1071
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:13,013
for all I care?

1072
01:07:13,013 --> 01:07:15,791
That'll get us in big trouble.

1073
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:16,874
- We'll see.

1074
01:07:16,874 --> 01:07:18,041
Come on Grode.

1075
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:24,246
- Hey, was he really wearing
mama's little stinker

1076
01:07:24,246 --> 01:07:25,990
underpants with the cartoon skunk?

1077
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:26,823
- Yeah.

1078
01:07:26,823 --> 01:07:28,471
- Oh man.

1079
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:30,791
I used to have a pair of
those in second grade.

1080
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:32,871
You know, novelty item
to amuse the parents.

1081
01:07:32,871 --> 01:07:34,828
I used to put them on my head
and used to dance around--

1082
01:07:34,828 --> 01:07:37,610
- Too much information, Sam.

1083
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,443
- Whatever.
- Let's go.

1084
01:07:50,252 --> 01:07:52,450
- [Man] Trespassers in area 102.

1085
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:54,811
No no boys, you did the
right thing calling me.

1086
01:07:54,811 --> 01:07:56,972
- [Richie] That'll teach those idiots.

1087
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,222
(laughing)

1088
01:08:01,852 --> 01:08:03,532
- Guys guys.

1089
01:08:03,532 --> 01:08:05,248
This is it.

1090
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,788
This is where those kids
disappeared four years ago.

1091
01:08:07,788 --> 01:08:09,628
- This is area 102.

1092
01:08:09,628 --> 01:08:11,076
- Area 102?

1093
01:08:11,076 --> 01:08:13,094
- Twice as scary as Area 51.

1094
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:14,996
- I better scan for
surveillance equipment.

1095
01:08:14,996 --> 01:08:17,014
Power me up to level two.

1096
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:18,239
- Level two?

1097
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,572
- Yeah, it just sounds cool.

1098
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,700
- [Andy] I got some good
news and I got some bad news.

1099
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,617
- Bad news.

1100
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,537
- There are tons of laser
beams crisscrossing the ground.

1101
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:41,792
- Good news?

1102
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:45,959
- I don't know, I was just
trying to cushion the bad news.

1103
01:08:47,472 --> 01:08:49,939
Iris, put your arm around me.

1104
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:53,242
- Hey look, I like you and
all, but I'm not that--

1105
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:56,402
- Alright, just move when I move.

1106
01:08:56,402 --> 01:08:57,569
Three two one.

1107
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:02,885
Okay, okay, this way, this way.

1108
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:05,360
(suspenseful music)

1109
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,203
Again, on three.

1110
01:09:07,203 --> 01:09:08,786
Two, one, and jump.

1111
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:15,281
Okay straight, okay three, two, one, jump.

1112
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,445
- Hey hey hey.

1113
01:09:21,445 --> 01:09:23,301
That's the power plant over there.

1114
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:24,901
That means there must be an
entrance around here somewhere.

1115
01:09:24,901 --> 01:09:27,964
You know they have all these
for emergency evacuations.

1116
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:29,881
- How do you know that?

1117
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,822
- Standard covert military procedure,

1118
01:09:32,822 --> 01:09:34,914
read it on any website.

1119
01:09:34,914 --> 01:09:37,143
Okay look around at the trees
for any hairline fractures

1120
01:09:37,143 --> 01:09:39,226
or unusual root patterns.

1121
01:09:43,783 --> 01:09:45,700
- Hey, I see something.

1122
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:47,849
Look.

1123
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,375
Three two one and jump.

1124
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:56,721
Alright, alright.

1125
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:58,304
Foot over and jump.

1126
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:01,641
We're clear.

1127
01:10:29,454 --> 01:10:30,460
- Oh that's cute.

1128
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,641
So the masterminds behind this whole thing

1129
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:34,801
are the Keebler elves?

1130
01:10:34,801 --> 01:10:35,943
- There's a chance we
could have just triggered

1131
01:10:35,943 --> 01:10:38,526
some kind of warning mechanism.

1132
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,780
- How good a chance?

1133
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,780
- I'd say at least 50/50.

1134
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,460
- Sir, I'm showing
activity in quadrant six,

1135
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,127
probably a glitch on the system.

1136
01:10:58,536 --> 01:11:00,564
- There's no such thing as a glitch.

1137
01:11:00,564 --> 01:11:03,147
Cross check everything, always.

1138
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:10,505
(suspenseful music)

1139
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:12,181
- [Iris] This is amazing.

1140
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:16,348
- This is exactly like the
pictures on conspiracy.com.

1141
01:11:26,091 --> 01:11:28,091
Our tax dollars at work.

1142
01:11:28,948 --> 01:11:30,250
- You don't even have a job.

1143
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,583
- Okay, my dad's taxes then.

1144
01:11:39,268 --> 01:11:41,768
This is a transcendent moment.

1145
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:46,444
All my paranoias proven, justified.

1146
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:52,005
My life has meaning and a purpose.

1147
01:11:53,104 --> 01:11:56,608
- Sam, save it for a
tell-all book and Springer.

1148
01:11:56,608 --> 01:11:58,111
- Springer?

1149
01:11:58,111 --> 01:11:59,186
Are you kidding?

1150
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:01,019
60 Minutes or nothing.

1151
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:05,210
- Guys, can we get back to
the matter at hand here?

1152
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:06,591
We have to find the nerve center.

1153
01:12:06,591 --> 01:12:09,341
Take the fight to them, remember?

1154
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:44,571
- Hey, footprints.
- They're not military tracks.

1155
01:12:47,412 --> 01:12:48,991
- The humidity and low
level lights are really

1156
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:50,706
affecting these glasses.

1157
01:12:50,706 --> 01:12:52,468
It's hard to make out anything.

1158
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:53,850
- Do you see any laser traps?

1159
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:54,683
- No.

1160
01:12:55,631 --> 01:12:57,108
- Would you guys keep it down?

1161
01:12:57,108 --> 01:13:00,358
This place is probably wired for sound.

1162
01:13:04,805 --> 01:13:07,805
(suspenseful music)

1163
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,951
- Hey, here's a door with no handle.

1164
01:13:37,951 --> 01:13:40,708
- Looks like a combo lock lateral slide.

1165
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:41,958
Standard issue.

1166
01:13:43,631 --> 01:13:46,048
It's a pretty tricky tumbler.

1167
01:13:49,378 --> 01:13:50,655
Yeah.

1168
01:13:50,655 --> 01:13:51,488
Oh yeah.

1169
01:14:03,341 --> 01:14:04,258
- We're in.

1170
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,475
- [Iris] Whoa.

1171
01:14:20,475 --> 01:14:21,308
- Sweet.

1172
01:14:24,054 --> 01:14:26,804
(dramatic music)

1173
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:57,749
This is all from the corps of engineers.

1174
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:08,428
- Hey, these are the
blueprints to this power plant.

1175
01:15:08,428 --> 01:15:11,952
And the overlay for this
underground construction.

1176
01:15:11,952 --> 01:15:13,312
- The whole power plant
was just a cover up

1177
01:15:13,312 --> 01:15:16,153
for these underground networks.

1178
01:15:16,153 --> 01:15:19,232
Divert the public's attention,
the old magician's trick.

1179
01:15:19,232 --> 01:15:22,896
- And to think the government
would deceive the public.

1180
01:15:22,896 --> 01:15:24,979
- Hey guys, look at this.

1181
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:39,008
- Oh man, oh man.

1182
01:15:39,008 --> 01:15:40,851
Do you know what these things are?

1183
01:15:40,851 --> 01:15:42,410
God, I can't believe I
didn't bring my camera.

1184
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,051
This is in my book for sure.

1185
01:15:44,051 --> 01:15:45,491
- What's so special about 'em?

1186
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:48,371
- I mean all the pieces fit,
this just proves everything.

1187
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:49,555
Don't you see?

1188
01:15:49,555 --> 01:15:51,327
These are the bikes that
those kids who disappeared on

1189
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:52,327
were riding.

1190
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:57,309
Stu Bryant, Delden Swanson, Kimball Pike.

1191
01:15:57,309 --> 01:15:58,984
Two were on bikes, one was on foot.

1192
01:15:58,984 --> 01:16:00,589
Look, they were playing paint wars.

1193
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:01,839
Paintball guns.

1194
01:16:02,952 --> 01:16:04,669
Must have kept them here as evidence.

1195
01:16:04,669 --> 01:16:06,173
As cover up.

1196
01:16:06,173 --> 01:16:08,552
- Uh, do you have any other
questions you want answered?

1197
01:16:08,552 --> 01:16:10,109
- Yeah, like where are they.

1198
01:16:10,109 --> 01:16:12,771
(alarm blaring)

1199
01:16:12,771 --> 01:16:13,604
- Well you can ask the

1200
01:16:13,604 --> 01:16:14,526
three soldiers coming down the tunnel.

1201
01:16:14,526 --> 01:16:16,526
As for me, I'm outta here.

1202
01:16:16,526 --> 01:16:17,529
Iris?

1203
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:19,279
- [Iris] I'm so gone.

1204
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,647
- Look, get on the bike.

1205
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:28,590
- I never learned to ride.

1206
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,587
- What?

1207
01:16:29,587 --> 01:16:31,003
- Oh what you didn't get that?

1208
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,227
Great, then it gives me a second chance

1209
01:16:32,227 --> 01:16:33,747
to humiliate myself by
telling you I never knew

1210
01:16:33,747 --> 01:16:35,369
how to ride a bike.

1211
01:16:35,369 --> 01:16:36,386
- Well get on the pegs.

1212
01:16:36,386 --> 01:16:37,964
- No no no, I'll just slow you down.

1213
01:16:37,964 --> 01:16:38,969
Look, look.

1214
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,185
You guys go this way and I'll go this way.

1215
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:41,425
Divert their attention.

1216
01:16:41,425 --> 01:16:42,867
We'll meet up where we came back in.

1217
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:44,164
- You do realize the one that goes alone

1218
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:45,470
always gets caught?

1219
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,209
- It's just a cliche.

1220
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:49,086
- Remember, we're a team, always.

1221
01:16:49,086 --> 01:16:49,919
- Right.

1222
01:17:02,386 --> 01:17:05,136
(dramatic music)

1223
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:27,372
- Move it, move it, move it!

1224
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:29,872
Down corridor three, now, now!

1225
01:18:09,328 --> 01:18:12,328
- Well well, fancy meeting you here.

1226
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,083
- I can explain.

1227
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,873
- Oh, I guarantee you will explain.

1228
01:18:22,873 --> 01:18:25,230
When I'm through with
you, you will explain

1229
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:28,030
why you chose the breakfast
you ate on the last Tuesday

1230
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:28,863
of 1993.

1231
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:32,669
Was it an omelet?

1232
01:18:32,669 --> 01:18:34,002
Maybe Pop Tarts.

1233
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:13,873
- Sorry guys.

1234
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:22,175
- Guess cliches are cliches for a reason.

1235
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:23,875
- Look, I'm the one you want.

1236
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:27,113
Let Sam and Iris go and
I'll do whatever you say.

1237
01:19:27,113 --> 01:19:28,030
- Touching.

1238
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:30,852
You know I'll just chalk that up

1239
01:19:30,852 --> 01:19:33,273
to the stupidity of youth.

1240
01:19:33,273 --> 01:19:37,615
From what I can see, I'm
holding all the aces.

1241
01:19:37,615 --> 01:19:40,735
You, you're just a joker in the deck.

1242
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:41,985
Card analogies.

1243
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:44,992
They are so vivid.

1244
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:48,085
Move out!

1245
01:20:12,459 --> 01:20:14,042
- Ow!
- Move it kid.

1246
01:20:16,782 --> 01:20:19,615
Let's go you two, keep up with us.

1247
01:20:21,005 --> 01:20:22,904
Hey, guess what.

1248
01:20:22,904 --> 01:20:25,237
You got a date with my boss.

1249
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:44,927
Have a seat.

1250
01:21:14,605 --> 01:21:17,325
- You may be wondering
why you're still alive,

1251
01:21:17,325 --> 01:21:19,658
or at least not blindfolded.

1252
01:21:22,306 --> 01:21:23,223
The fact is

1253
01:21:28,587 --> 01:21:30,349
I'm just so gosh darn
proud of my work here

1254
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:32,845
I simply had to show off.

1255
01:21:32,845 --> 01:21:37,012
Especially to an interested,
albeit captive, audience.

1256
01:21:40,386 --> 01:21:42,636
(chuckles)

1257
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:53,241
- I'll take supervillains
for 400 please, Alex.

1258
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,726
- You may be interested
in knowing the origin

1259
01:21:54,726 --> 01:21:58,463
of what you're seeing here,
all this precision labor,

1260
01:21:58,463 --> 01:22:00,546
sweat, glory, excellence.

1261
01:22:01,469 --> 01:22:02,946
It's all a byproduct.

1262
01:22:02,946 --> 01:22:05,266
Technological byproduct.

1263
01:22:05,266 --> 01:22:06,706
Ah.
(snaps)

1264
01:22:06,706 --> 01:22:09,085
Okay, here's an analogy
that you children may

1265
01:22:09,085 --> 01:22:11,527
be able to relate to.

1266
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:13,944
Just like the chicken nugget.

1267
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:18,487
The chicken nugget was
actually the excess of a failed

1268
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:22,654
chicken sandwich, but some
forward thinking executive

1269
01:22:23,603 --> 01:22:27,683
recognized that he could
sell that byproduct.

1270
01:22:27,683 --> 01:22:29,527
And of course, naturally,
inevitably, it became

1271
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:32,246
more popular than the original!

1272
01:22:32,246 --> 01:22:35,405
Which is precisely what's happening here.

1273
01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:38,526
We were siphoning
technology from VectroComp.

1274
01:22:38,526 --> 01:22:41,506
- Through a carefully placed
operative in the company.

1275
01:22:41,506 --> 01:22:42,673
Little old me.

1276
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,826
- And the byproduct of the x-ray device

1277
01:22:46,826 --> 01:22:50,243
was the possibility of a cloaking device.

1278
01:22:52,589 --> 01:22:56,756
Rearrange molecular structure
to create invisibility.

1279
01:22:58,685 --> 01:23:02,352
- I know someone I'd
like to make disappear.

1280
01:23:03,666 --> 01:23:05,069
- We were getting
information from VectroComp

1281
01:23:05,069 --> 01:23:06,617
at a good rate but not
(snapping)

1282
01:23:06,617 --> 01:23:07,758
fast enough.

1283
01:23:07,758 --> 01:23:10,660
Funding from our sources had dried up

1284
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:14,827
due to a rather unfortunate,
really quite tragic situation.

1285
01:23:18,438 --> 01:23:20,438
The end of the Cold War.

1286
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:26,457
Our project was at risk
so I planted Boyd here

1287
01:23:26,457 --> 01:23:29,337
to help with the development
of the x-ray device

1288
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,837
so that we could catch up here and we did.

1289
01:23:36,777 --> 01:23:40,158
Until the unexpected popped
up to make things really

1290
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:41,575
interesting, you.

1291
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:47,598
You were the X factor
that we could not predict.

1292
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:50,457
The mathematic variable.

1293
01:23:52,015 --> 01:23:54,137
Let's take care of the glasses.

1294
01:23:54,137 --> 01:23:57,118
- We should have visual
confirmation of the glasses

1295
01:23:57,118 --> 01:23:57,951
very soon.

1296
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:02,340
Power up the cloaking turbine!

1297
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:04,660
(dramatic music)

1298
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,827
(buzzing)

1299
01:24:21,438 --> 01:24:23,977
- What about the three
kids, what happened to them?

1300
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:27,172
- Oh they're here, just
not in this dimension.

1301
01:24:27,172 --> 01:24:31,460
Their molecular information
is stored in this device.

1302
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,877
So they do exist.

1303
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:36,797
- What are you gonna do to us?

1304
01:24:36,797 --> 01:24:40,617
- I think that those three
children need some company.

1305
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:44,784
After all it has been four
long years for crying out loud.

1306
01:24:47,641 --> 01:24:50,391
(alarms blaring)

1307
01:25:02,776 --> 01:25:05,617
Your friend Mr. Carver has
provided the final piece

1308
01:25:05,617 --> 01:25:07,241
of the puzzle.

1309
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:09,401
The energy from the
crystal of those glasses

1310
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:12,041
has been absorbed into the mainframe.

1311
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,958
A very new age concept.

1312
01:25:25,857 --> 01:25:28,024
(humming)

1313
01:25:29,547 --> 01:25:31,214
You know what I see?

1314
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:37,610
I see a scared little boy who is not long

1315
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:40,031
for the third dimension.

1316
01:25:40,031 --> 01:25:41,307
Boyd!

1317
01:25:41,307 --> 01:25:42,870
- Yes sir.

1318
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:45,787
- Prepare for dimensional cloaking.

1319
01:25:48,532 --> 01:25:51,282
(dramatic music)

1320
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,227
- But sir, I--

1321
01:25:55,222 --> 01:25:57,222
- There is no I in team.

1322
01:25:58,184 --> 01:26:01,005
Everything, everything for the
greater good of the project.

1323
01:26:01,005 --> 01:26:02,838
- But I--
- Just do it!

1324
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:12,464
(snaps)

1325
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:15,131
(alarm blaring)

1326
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:26,013
I'll make your photos on the milk cartons

1327
01:26:26,013 --> 01:26:28,141
look suitably flattering.

1328
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,641
Goodbye, children.

1329
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:41,260
- [Soldier] This way, kids.

1330
01:27:16,324 --> 01:27:18,491
(zapping)

1331
01:27:24,644 --> 01:27:27,894
- I've got two Snickers in my backpack.

1332
01:27:30,528 --> 01:27:32,195
- [Biddle] What the?

1333
01:27:35,129 --> 01:27:38,879
- Andy the plate, push
Biddle onto the plate!

1334
01:27:41,569 --> 01:27:43,069
- I got your back.

1335
01:27:47,752 --> 01:27:51,919
(zapping)
(screaming)

1336
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:23,049
It's alright, the police are
surrounding the place outside.

1337
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:24,485
They won't get far.

1338
01:28:24,485 --> 01:28:26,153
- But how did you?

1339
01:28:26,153 --> 01:28:29,168
- You know I have had blueprints and specs

1340
01:28:29,168 --> 01:28:31,327
on a machine like this for months.

1341
01:28:31,327 --> 01:28:34,088
I never had the resources though.

1342
01:28:34,088 --> 01:28:36,553
It's a bipolar device.

1343
01:28:36,553 --> 01:28:38,350
It's an amazing machine.

1344
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:40,633
- I mean well you just about
earned your own chapter

1345
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:43,913
in my book, you know, not to
mention part of the royalties.

1346
01:28:43,913 --> 01:28:47,069
- Yeah Mr. Baker, impeccable
timing I must say.

1347
01:28:47,069 --> 01:28:49,929
- Well you can thank your
hoodlum friends for that.

1348
01:28:49,929 --> 01:28:52,073
They called me and
convinced me that they were

1349
01:28:52,073 --> 01:28:53,148
telling the truth.

1350
01:28:53,148 --> 01:28:57,089
Now I'm afraid I have a
lot of apologizing to do

1351
01:28:57,089 --> 01:28:59,331
to Andy's stepfather.

1352
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:00,830
- My dad.

1353
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:03,413
I mean you can call him my dad.

1354
01:29:05,709 --> 01:29:09,651
Boyd, where do you think you're headed?

1355
01:29:09,651 --> 01:29:10,484
- Malcolm?

1356
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:12,623
Malcolm!

1357
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:16,726
(chuckling)

1358
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:19,571
I am so glad that you came when you did.

1359
01:29:19,571 --> 01:29:23,108
You have no idea what
it is like to be forced,

1360
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:26,120
forced to do something against your will.

1361
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,787
Now, now I know what
Patty Hearst felt like.

1362
01:29:31,858 --> 01:29:32,941
There were guns--

1363
01:29:32,941 --> 01:29:34,301
- Can it, Boyd.

1364
01:29:34,301 --> 01:29:38,040
I heard, saw, and
recorded more than enough.

1365
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:41,938
You've been tripped up, or in
parlance you'll understand,

1366
01:29:41,938 --> 01:29:43,817
you got jail.

1367
01:29:43,817 --> 01:29:46,067
(laughing)

1368
01:29:52,057 --> 01:29:54,328
- [Andy] Come on, the food in
the slammer couldn't have been

1369
01:29:54,328 --> 01:29:55,867
that bad, could it?

1370
01:29:55,867 --> 01:29:59,064
- I'll miss those jailhouse cabbage rolls.

1371
01:29:59,064 --> 01:30:01,314
(laughing)

1372
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:03,357
Mm.

1373
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:11,075
It's good to be home.

1374
01:30:11,075 --> 01:30:13,235
- It's good to have you home, John.

1375
01:30:13,235 --> 01:30:16,472
You've got a heck of
a son there, you know.

1376
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:19,613
- And I have got a great
pitch for a TV series.

1377
01:30:19,613 --> 01:30:22,333
World's wildest conspiracies.

1378
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:26,813
Gonna blow that bogus alien
autopsy thing out of the water.

1379
01:30:26,813 --> 01:30:29,831
- Andy, I can't thank you enough.

1380
01:30:29,831 --> 01:30:33,075
You know, what you saw
when you visited Nancy

1381
01:30:33,075 --> 01:30:36,333
it was a nodule pressing
against her optic nerve.

1382
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:40,515
All the conventional
x-rays she's had missed it.

1383
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:43,613
So we're going to the
Mayo Clinic on Friday

1384
01:30:43,613 --> 01:30:47,533
and we don't know exactly
what the results will be

1385
01:30:47,533 --> 01:30:50,173
but we've got a lot of hope.

1386
01:30:50,173 --> 01:30:53,840
- I see enough to know
you're a special boy.

1387
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:04,201
- Uh, could you excuse me for a minute?

1388
01:31:04,201 --> 01:31:05,034
- Sure.

1389
01:31:13,321 --> 01:31:15,204
- So back to school tomorrow.

1390
01:31:15,204 --> 01:31:17,287
Seems kinda dull now huh?

1391
01:31:18,324 --> 01:31:19,481
- Not for me.

1392
01:31:19,481 --> 01:31:21,684
- I mean, you'll probably
be too busy with schoolwork

1393
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:24,462
and other stuff to hang out much, huh?

1394
01:31:24,462 --> 01:31:26,462
- Busy, yes, stupid, no.

1395
01:31:27,609 --> 01:31:29,353
We still got that date coming, right?

1396
01:31:29,353 --> 01:31:30,520
- You know it.

1397
01:31:32,302 --> 01:31:36,462
- Besides, I only have x-ray eyes for you.

1398
01:31:36,462 --> 01:31:39,022
- That was pretty bad.

1399
01:31:39,022 --> 01:31:41,124
- I can see clearly now?

1400
01:31:41,124 --> 01:31:42,917
You're a sight for sore eyes.

1401
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:44,462
How about--

1402
01:31:44,462 --> 01:31:47,212
(swelling music)

1403
01:32:09,262 --> 01:32:12,012
