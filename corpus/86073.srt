1
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,317
Slow it down, Bob.

2
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,994
Need a doughnut break.
We're having chest pains.

3
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,991
Keep it moving, flabby.

4
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,310
Opening night
is less than a week away.

5
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,439
Where in the script does it say that
Truman Capote has a fat, saggy ass?.

6
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,913
In the very beginning. "Enter Capote,
followed by his fat, saggy ass."

7
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,312
-Hi, Walt.
-Oh, Suzie-Q, looking good. Ruthy.

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,869
-Let's have drinks again soon.
-I'll call you.

9
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,716
Nice. When did you
have drinks with her?.

10
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,472
The other day. Didn't I tell you?.
She stopped by.

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,029
-Well, where was l?.
-You were....

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,555
Oh, that's right,
you were taking a nap.

13
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,794
-So did you make a move?.
-I wanted to. I couldn't get her alone.

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,270
Had that friend, Ruthy, with her.
She's like a frigging shadow.

15
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,596
-Hi.
-Pole. Pole. Pole.

16
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,878
Okay, now that's seven mushroom,
three onion...

17
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,600
...two regular cheese
but one with no pickles.

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,236
Änd we have six fries, four Pepsi,
and two 7 UP.

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,270
You got 180 seconds,
or that food is free.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,158
Keep your wallets handy, boys.

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,236
I keep flip-flopping whether
to go with the suit or the kimono.

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,039
Hey, guys, we've got a tester
on number six.

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,351
Okay, thanks, Mim.
What did Robert Morse do in it?.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,795
He did both,
but he had the budget for it.

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,669
We got 1 2 Ämerican Charlies,
seven with fungus, three tearjerkers...

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,912
...two bare-assed, hold the pom-poms
on one and frog sticks.

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,594
We could do it with three hands
tied behind our backs!

28
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,431
Rocket, I need four Pepsi
and two 7 UP on number six.

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,478
Don't forget, you've got two
Diet Pepsi on number nine.

30
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,108
You got it, Mimmy.
Three 7 UP coming up.

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,750
-No, it's two 7 UP--
-I got it. I got it.

32
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,436
Looks like
they're having serious trouble.

33
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,829
Come on. Come on.

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,356
1 2, 1 1, 10, 9...

35
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,796
-...8, 7, 6, 5...
-I'd go with the kimono.

36
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,633
...4, 3, 2--

37
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,873
-I'm sorry, boys. Maybe next time.
-Thanks, Mimmy.

38
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,433
So close.

39
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,079
You downloaded another picture
of your lnternet pal.

40
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,117
What's her name, Poon Tang?.

41
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,478
-Her name is May Fong.
-So she says.

42
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,870
She could be
a 50-year-old circus freak...

43
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,873
...with six teeth
and a set of hairy walnuts.

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,672
Nice.

45
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,709
They paid 3.5 million.
We could've gotten it for 1.2.

46
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,154
I want my drink.

47
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,630
Well, hallelujah.
We finally got our drinks.

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,756
Root beer machine
had to be changed.

49
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,311
What the--?. Hold on, pal. Diet Pepsi.
We ordered Diet Pepsi. Äre you dense?.

50
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,438
I'm Rocket. Dennis works
at the post office. Need stamps?.

51
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,909
Oh, so you're a smart-ass, huh?.

52
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,389
Oh, you idiot!
These are my good pants!

53
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,393
Oh, those are her good pants.

54
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,232
Honey--

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,874
Unbelievable.

56
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,350
-I want to talk to the owner.
-Äll right, right behind you.

57
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,309
Which one of you two
is in charge of this dump?.

58
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,789
Your damn busboy just ruined
my wife's pants.

59
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,078
Well, I'm sorry about that.
You know, club soda's good for that.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,596
I'm sure you think it's very progressive
to hire Jerry's Kids...

61
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,671
...but keep the freaks in the back...

62
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,554
...washing dishes,
away from the paying customers.

63
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,076
You are absolutely right.
How many times have I told you, Walt...

64
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,038
-...we don't want freaks here.
-He tells me. I never--

65
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,431
-Ever! Ever, do you?.
-For some reason. I don't know why.

66
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,319
We're on top of it.
We're gonna handle it right now.

67
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,040
Rocket, let me talk to you
for a minute.

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,269
You know, we have a rule about freaks
in this place. We don't like them.

69
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,358
And we don't want them.

70
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,070
So, Rocket,
you see that door over there?.

71
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,350
Would you escort
this freak through it?.

72
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,115
No problem.
Right this way, please.

73
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,679
I'm not going anywhere.

74
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,673
Don't forget your bag.

75
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,629
Come on, let's get out of here.

76
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,038
Would you like those root beers to go?.

77
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,509
Äll right, burgers on the house!

78
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,270
-He's just kidding, you cheap bastards.
-No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,749
No, yeah, he is. He is.

80
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,752
-Nice stop, guys. Way to go.
-Thanks, Stan.

81
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,996
Great game, Walt.
That was a huge win.

82
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,799
Thanks, Stan. I was seeing
the puck well tonight.

83
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,794
-Walt, how many saves you guys have?.
-I had 1 1, and Bob had 26.

84
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,838
Bob-o was standing
on his head out there.

85
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,718
Check this out.

86
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,436
Wow, she's new. Hey, Dave,
how about another tall one?.

87
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,750
You got it.
How about you there, Bob?.

88
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,480
No, I'm cool.
I'm the designated walker tonight.

89
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,914
Got it.

90
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,994
I taste ice cream.

91
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,957
You got a dart in your head,
you dumb shit.

92
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,910
Hey, Romeo, how about you invite your
friend May out for a visit this spring?.

93
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,389
Vineyard can be romantic
that time of year...

94
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,913
...and we so horny.

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,278
No, I checked the Farmer's Älmanac.
It's supposed to be a muddy spring.

96
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,637
No, it's gonna be sloppy.
I don't want her to come out--

97
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,478
Seriously, man, I just--
You know, I want it to be right.

98
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,359
-I'm trying to be smart.
-You overanalyze this stuff.

99
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,397
What is that supposed to mean?.

100
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,711
You should be talking to this chickie-poo
down at the bar.

101
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,116
-No.
-Come on.

102
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,716
-Come on. Get over there. Say hello.
-No. No. No, don't do it.

103
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,997
-No way. Cut it out. Stop it.
-Go on. She's smiling at you.

104
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,630
If she wanted to talk to somebody,
she would've brought a friend.

105
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,831
Hi. How are you?. My name's Bob Tenor.
But I'm really more of a baritone.

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,797
Hi, Bob.

107
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,315
This is my brother, Walt.

108
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,871
Look, if you're ever in town--
I mean, I know you're in town now...

109
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,237
...but I mean, if you're ever in town
and not in a bar....

110
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,676
That came off wrong. It sounded
like you were a skanky whore.

111
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,629
I'd love it if you'd come by
Quikee Burger...

112
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,349
...which is my restaurant that I own
with my brother, Walt.

113
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,317
You met him.

114
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,709
Time's up, Casanever.

115
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,836
-Can I join you for a drink?.
-Sure.

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,797
-Okay. What's your name?.
-Debbie.

117
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,952
-Hi, I'm Walt Tenor.
-Nice to meet you.

118
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,838
Dear May,
thanks for the latest photo,

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,389
I look at it whenever
I'm in need of a smile,

120
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,314
I'm sending a picture of me at work,
Hope you like it,

121
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,710
Yours, Bob,

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,030
I' m starting to cramp.

123
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,833
-Hey.
-Hey.

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,831
-How's the letter coming?.
-Good.

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,718
Yeah, what do you got?.

126
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,839
It's personal. You know,
I don't go nosing into your business.

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,356
I'm sorry.
Mind typing on your knees?.

128
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,794
Okay.

129
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,155
Here we go. There you go.
Turn around.

130
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,274
-Shouldn't you study your lines?.
-Not necessary. Locked and loaded.

131
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,112
Then help me stack the wood.

132
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,716
I can't. I could pull something.
It's a performance day.

133
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,559
Ären't you a little bit nervous?.

134
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,517
What's a four-letter word for snatch?.

135
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,757
Grab.

136
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,879
You're not even a little bit nervous?.

137
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,349
What's there to be nervous about?.

138
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,310
Well, you're up there in a one-man
show, in front of all those people.

139
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,948
You know, I'd be crapping myself.

140
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,270
It's my ninth year,
I think I'm just....

141
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,715
I feel like I'm over it, you know?.

142
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,031
-I guess that's how you have to be.
-Well....

143
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,075
You're doing that blinking thing.
Äre you gonna have a panic attack?.

144
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,071
-No, I'm cool.
-Äre you all right?.

145
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,515
-You all right?.
-No, I'm not gonna--

146
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,592
-I'm gonna--
-Oh, God. Take it easy.

147
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,352
-Calm down.
-I think I'm dying.

148
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,839
-I'm dying.
-You're not.

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,753
-Oh, God.
-You're having a panic attack.

150
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,751
-Come on. Take it easy.
-Get my bag.

151
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,911
Wait, I'm having an arrhythmia.

152
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,152
Here you go. Breathe into the bag.
Short breaths.

153
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,276
Concentrate on the breathing.

154
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,159
It's nine years in a row!
I don't want to go on-stage.

155
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,390
Why do I have to go on-stage
with you?.

156
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,358
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine, all right?.

157
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,958
You're gonna have fun tonight,
all right?.

158
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,712
You're gonna have fun.

159
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,034
Äny normal person with a normal sense
of self-preservation...

160
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,715
...would understand that
all an artist has is his life.

161
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,636
Änd what he observes
as he passes through his life.

162
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,191
Änd any serious writer hanging out
for years with the rich, well...

163
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,114
...my God, you'd have to be deluded
to the point of derangement...

164
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,035
...not to realize that that writer
was taking notes.

165
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,670
My God, I even told them.

166
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,549
They knew I was writing this book.
What did they think I was there for?.

167
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,234
The intellectual stimulation?.

168
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,799
The wit?.

169
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,632
The spiritual uplift?.

170
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,917
I brought the intellect
and the wit to the party.

171
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,193
Okay, okay, he's coming.
He's coming.

172
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,799
Bravo! Bravo!

173
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,793
-You were just wonderful!
-Thank you, Mim.

174
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,632
Yeah, Walt, you were great.

175
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,711
Bob, you sucked.

176
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,519
-Hey.
-Come on, Rocket, I'm not an actor.

177
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,238
So, what's up for next year?.

178
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,116
-Oh, I don't know.
-Oh, come on, tell them the big idea.

179
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,475
-What is it?.
-He wants to do a musical version...

180
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,473
-...of Bonnie and Clyde.
-Äll right!

181
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,911
-You were awesome last night.
-Thanks.

182
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,990
Is everything all right?.
You seem a little--

183
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,870
Remember when we were little and we
first found out we'd never be separated?.

184
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,316
-Sure.
-Made a blood pact that day, remember?.

185
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,916
Yeah, we promised we'd never hold
each other back, no matter what.

186
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,709
Änd we never have. Right off the bat,
we made a hell of a team.

187
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,596
Trick or treat!

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,355
Get them! Get them!

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,833
Man, those freaks are fast.

190
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,157
Strike one!

191
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,834
Let's do it! Now, come on!
Get out there!

192
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,356
Break. Break. Break. Break. Okay,
come on. You keep it clean, now.

193
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,518
You're out!

194
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,353
Your kings and queens!

195
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,314
Right, Betty!

196
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,314
So, what's your point?

197
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,391
Here, sit down.

198
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,837
Oh, jeez.

199
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,677
I want to be an actor.

200
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,871
Yeah. Of course.

201
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,350
Look, I'm sorry, man.
I know I freaked out yesterday...

202
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,511
...but I'll go on-stage with you again.

203
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,468
You can even sing if you want to.
I'd never stop you from doing that.

204
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,355
I mean, I want to be a real actor.

205
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,953
I want to move to Hollywood.

206
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,590
-What?.!
-I think I got the chops for it.

207
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,830
Those people last night were moved.

208
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,754
-I got to them.
-Look, those were your friends.

209
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,950
What's that supposed to mean?.

210
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,315
Look, I just meant....

211
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,589
Look, man, we're from
Martha's Vineyard, okay?.

212
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,876
You know, people here....

213
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,508
You know, we're lifeguards
and fishermen.

214
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,989
We own restaurants.

215
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,197
We do not star in movies.

216
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,639
What about Meryl Streep?.

217
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,519
She's not from the Vineyard.
She shot one movie here.

218
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,797
She stayed on a couple extra
weeks because she liked it.

219
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,475
-What are you--?. What is your point?.
-Well....

220
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,592
Okay, look, I'm gonna
put it to you this way.

221
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,316
Who were the last conjoined twins
who were nominated for an Oscar?.

222
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,792
I can't believe I'm hearing this
from you, of all people.

223
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,349
Isn't that what people told us
our whole lives?.

224
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,398
We couldn't do what normal
people did. Never stopped us.

225
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,394
By the way, Hollywood just happens
to be in L.Ä. where May Fong lives.

226
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,233
I'm not ready for that.
She's crowding me as it is.

227
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,915
Crowding you?.! She's been
your lnternet pal for three years.

228
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,196
You haven't even met her!

229
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,477
Look, man. What about me, man?.
I have a business here.

230
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,518
If things work out,
we can open a Quikee Burger in L.Ä.

231
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,639
Yeah, or better yet, maybe
you can get in the movie biz too.

232
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,870
What am I gonna do
in the movie business?.

233
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,715
I don't know. You could be
my stunt double.

234
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,518
-Your stunt double?.
-Yeah.

235
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,275
If I gotta do, like, a dangerous stunt,
you could do it...

236
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,556
...so that I don't get hurt.

237
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,557
Come on. I need to do this
while I still can. I'm getting old, Bob.

238
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,756
-Walt, you're 32.
-Going on 50.

239
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,798
Listen, I can't help it
you got most of our liver. Okay?.

240
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,394
I'm aging faster.
I got bags under my eyes.

241
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,394
Änd you?. Time's passing. You got
nothing to show except for pictures.

242
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,519
-You haven't been laid in five years.
-Hey, how would you know?.

243
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,076
I don't know, Walt.

244
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,437
You know,
we got a great thing going here.

245
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,353
-lt might not be the same--
-lt might be better!

246
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,988
Have you ever thought about that?.

247
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,549
Three months, we go,
we see how it works out.

248
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,429
If it doesn't, we come home.
I'll be happy because I know we tried.

249
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,554
Okay, Hollywood...

250
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,678
...but you're gonna owe me
bigtime for this.

251
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,318
Bye.

252
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,238
Bye, Bob.

253
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,028
You sure this is the right
Hollywood and Vine?.

254
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,397
-Äccording to the brochure, it is.
-Show us your power, Lord.

255
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,714
Lord, Lord, hates the sin,
but loves the sinner.

256
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,077
-Show us your truth, Jesus.
-Holy smokes.

257
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,831
Hey, freaks!

258
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,638
Yo!

259
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,076
Hello!

260
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,953
Fade out!

261
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,792
My wife's not out there, is she?.

262
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,350
No, I haven't seen anybody.

263
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,751
That psycho midget's
been riding my ass...

264
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,754
...to finish this screenplay I've been
working on for the last two years.

265
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,477
This is it.

266
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,278
Clean sheets and towels.

267
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,873
There'll be a pot of green tea
in the office every morning.

268
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,600
-Name's Moe if you need anything.
-This is great.

269
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,399
Do you have a room
with a double bed?.

270
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,432
Sorry, this is all I got.

271
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,631
But tell you what I can do...

272
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,395
...I'll see if I can get a queen bed
in here in about a week or two.

273
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,519
-See you guys.
-Thanks, Moe.

274
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,999
Give her a call.
Let her know we're here.

275
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,752
What--?.

276
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,471
This is serious. We have
a lot of things to do out here.

277
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,837
Not the least of which
is get you into a casting agency...

278
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,309
...without them laughing you
out of the room.

279
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,072
Why would they laugh?.

280
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,798
I mean, look at you.

281
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,873
You're pale as a ghost.
We gotta get you a tan.

282
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,749
Okay, what's a four-letter word
for voiceless, ends in D?.

283
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,798
-Surd.
-Surd?.

284
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,951
Surd with a U.

285
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,512
I gotta tell you, this crossword's a lot
easier than the one I'm used to at home.

286
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,914
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?.

287
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,558
-Hey!
-Hi.

288
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,314
-Äre you new around here?.
-Got in this morning.

289
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,711
-My name's Walt.
-Hey, I'm Äpril.

290
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,156
-This is my brother, Bob.
-Hey. Bob Tenor.

291
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,993
Have a seat.

292
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,639
So you guys are brand-new.

293
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,679
-Our first California sunburn.
-We're official.

294
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,791
You're gonna love it here
at the Star.

295
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,838
I've been here, like,
two and a half years, and--

296
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,310
Hey, you guys are stuck together.
And I still love it here.

297
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,391
We're like one big happy family.

298
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,676
So where'd you get this done?.

299
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,470
No, no, we were born like this.

300
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,393
Cool. Cool.
Änd where are you guys from?.

301
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,950
Massachusetts.
Bob here's a lover/grillman...

302
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,839
...and I came out
to give acting a shot.

303
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,398
Oh, my God! I'm an actor too.

304
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,198
-Oh, yeah?.
-You're an actor?.

305
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,828
Yeah. Well, no.
I mean, I want to be one.

306
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,355
Right now I'm just
kind of a lingerie model.

307
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,953
Oh, my God! So am l.

308
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,951
No, he isn't.

309
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,509
No, seriously, like,
do you have an agent?.

310
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,432
No, no, not yet. How about you?.

311
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,875
No, not momentarily,
but I did have one.

312
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,474
This colostomy bag
named Morty O'Reilly.

313
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,915
-Hey, you want a beer?.
-Yeah.

314
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,719
I've had better luck on my own.
Every morning I read Back Stage West.

315
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,154
-Can I see?.
-Yeah.

316
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,834
Änd it lists all the open casting calls.

317
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,359
Yeah, you don't even need
an agent with that thing.

318
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,149
Bob, check this out. Right here.

319
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,788
"Wanted: Tall, handsome,
distinguished actor...

320
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,349
...to play Robin Hood
for the new millennium."

321
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,873
-That's you!
-That is me!

322
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,951
-That is you!
-ls that me?.

323
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,872
-Yeah, it's you!
-lt is me.

324
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,078
You guys are fun.

325
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,676
Listen, ye all, and hear me now.

326
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,309
The sheriff of Nottingham
will come forth...

327
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,234
...but he will not bend
this merry band of--

328
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,231
Of brothers!

329
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,237
He will--

330
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,752
Who put you up to this?.

331
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,593
It was Lovett over at CÄÄ,
wasn't it?.

332
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,954
Joan, get that SOB on the horn
for me, will you, please?.

333
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,312
Did you bring a headshot
and list of your credits?.

334
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,679
You know, I was supposed to do that,
and I forgot it at home.

335
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,555
Sometimes I think he'd forget
his own brother if I wasn't sewn on.

336
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,789
Okay, thank you for coming.
We'll be in touch.

337
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,274
No.

338
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,830
I'm sorry, but the message
that we're trying to get across...

339
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,075
...is that Dubble Bubble doubles
the taste, not causes birth defects.

340
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,193
I don't know.
Maybe you were right, Bob.

341
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,237
Maybe this is a pipe dream.

342
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,188
Yeah. Probably time to face facts.

343
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,113
If you haven't made it
in the first 72 hours...

344
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,556
-...you should probably just pack it in.
-Right.

345
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,077
I bet Meryl Streep wasn't out here
six hours before she got her big break.

346
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,231
De Niro too.

347
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,914
Änd Steve Buscemi?.
With his pearly whites...

348
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,117
...he was in town 45 minutes
before he got his first role.

349
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,714
-Äre you making fun of me?.
-You bet I am.

350
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,431
I know you were born without a liver,
but you got some backbone, didn't you?.

351
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,956
-You gotta admit these past couple of--
-I'm not gonna admit anything.

352
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,395
How do we know
the Lion King producers...

353
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,109
...aren't looking for some
conjoined hyenas as we speak?.

354
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,872
Know who will get the part now?.

355
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,555
Those Schappell sisters from Oregon
who are stuck at the forehead.

356
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,915
Why?. They're country-and-western
singers, not actors.

357
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,152
Because you quit, that's why.

358
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,552
Right.

359
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,349
-Maybe I was a little hasty.
-Good.

360
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,830
Hey, don't worry about anything.

361
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,313
I happen to have a little plan that's going
into effect first thing tomorrow morning.

362
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,389
Äll right.
You're a great brother, Bob.

363
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,473
Yeah, I know, now zip the lip.
Let's get some sleep.

364
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,111
I like your plan.

365
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,398
The car's only plan Ä.
Plan B is to get you an agent.

366
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,232
Right.

367
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,838
Retirement home?. Äre you sure
we got the right address?.

368
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,911
This is what he gave me.

369
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,949
Maybe we should try someone else.
Äpril said this Morty guy's a total sleaze.

370
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,949
But you said he's the only one
that would give us an appointment.

371
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,152
I want you to know up front...

372
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,472
...that O'Reilly only represents actors
who are truly committed to their craft.

373
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,189
That's me, Mr. O'Reilly.
I am fully committed.

374
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,557
Committed enough to pay
my $200 up-front service fee?.

375
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,838
Which, of course, is used to defray
the costs of registration fees...

376
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,355
...entitlement paperwork
and what have you.

377
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,717
-What are you doing?.
-I'm showing him how committed I am.

378
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,997
You're showing him
how stupid you are. Here.

379
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,118
We'll give you $100 because
you're only representing one of us.

380
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,430
Look, I'm gonna level with you.

381
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,114
Siamese twins
ain't the easiest sell I've had.

382
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,396
We're not Siamese. We're American.

383
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,634
I think what my brother's saying is,
he'd prefer the term "conjoined twins."

384
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,677
Okay, but I should let you know...

385
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,834
...I'm not one of those run-of-the-mill
suits. I'm a full-service agent.

386
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,514
-Meaning?.
-I get 25 percent.

387
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,150
-Well, what does he get in return?.
-Seventy-five percent.

388
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,035
Well, I gotta tell you,
I think he seemed like a real player.

389
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,197
I guess.

390
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,351
Oh, my God. It's her.

391
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,398
Who?.

392
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,958
Don't, don't, don't, don't gawk.
Don't do that.

393
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,680
She's famous. She probably
hates when people gawk.

394
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,154
I like that part, but I just....

395
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,989
I think we gotta at least go by
and say hi.

396
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,720
Ä minute ago,
we couldn't even look at her...

397
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,635
-...and now we're gonna go say hello?.
-Hey, Bob, relax. It would be rude not to.

398
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,030
I'll do all the talking.

399
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,391
Excuse me, Ms. Streep.

400
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,790
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.

401
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,952
I know this is completely
inappropriate...

402
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,190
...but my brother Bob
is a big fan of yours. He just--

403
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,794
He wanted to come by and say hi.

404
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,554
-Hi.
-Hi, Bob.

405
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,072
We're from Oak Bluffs
on Martha's Vineyard.

406
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,753
I've been there.

407
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,517
Yeah, I know you have. Äctually,
we're friends with Timmy Sheehan.

408
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,152
-Who?.
-Timmy Sheehan.

409
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,669
Remember, he waited on you one time
at Jimmy Sea's restaurant?.

410
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,990
Remember?. You autographed
his menu for him.

411
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,957
I did.

412
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,710
I know because
I read it and it said:

413
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,792
"To Timmy, a good waiter.
From Meryl Streep."

414
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,679
But the way you signed the P,
it looked like an L...

415
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,593
...so we used to call Timmy
all the time and say:

416
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,276
"Hello, this is Meryl Streel calling."
We were just busting his nuts.

417
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,876
True story.

418
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,634
I think I remember him.

419
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,475
I ordered some food,
and he brought it to me.

420
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,475
That would be him.
He's a real character.

421
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,599
I can't believe you just come
to a restaurant and nobody bugs you.

422
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,397
Well....

423
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,272
Let's go.

424
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,278
Well, let me go.

425
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,317
Nice meeting you.

426
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,469
You know, by the way,
if you ever just wanna...

427
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,751
...get away, have a little hang time,
we're at the Rising Star apartments.

428
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,639
It is a pretty sweet setup.

429
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,190
We got a barbecue pit there.
Gas. He does steaks and chops.

430
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,593
We got a pool, a little grassy knoll area,
and feel free to just come by any time.

431
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,830
Okay. I'll keep it in mind.

432
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,036
-Great. Änd bring the posse.
-Okay.

433
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,031
Bring the posse.

434
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,958
Hey!

435
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,596
Wait a minute.
I do remember you guys.

436
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,320
Homecoming '87.
Oh, my God! I was at that game.

437
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,991
With seconds on the clock,
it's fourth down, one yard to go.

438
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,029
-Safety cheating.
-Check. Check.

439
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,875
Check. Check.
Äpache 36. Äpache 36.

440
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,237
Äpache 36. Äpache 36.

441
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,799
Okay, let's go.

442
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,432
Hike.

443
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,556
I'm wide open.

444
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,630
Touchdown, Vineyard.
Sharks win, 22-21.

445
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,789
That was you!

446
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,838
He actually is the one who scored
the winning touchdown.

447
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,956
Well, you threw him
a hell of a block.

448
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,393
I've always told you that.
You never give yourself enough credit.

449
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,714
Äs you can see, I'm on crutches.
I was wounded during the Vietnam War.

450
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,475
Had a hunting accident
while hiding in Canada.

451
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,474
Tried that Viagra stuff the other day.

452
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,757
I didn't get an erection,
but I could walk for three hours.

453
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,036
Did a benefit for
Jehovah Witnesses...

454
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,397
...all's they wanted to hear
were "knock, knock" jokes.

455
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,749
Then the three of us just sat there
and talked for, like, an hour.

456
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,911
Meryl--
She asked me to call her Meryl.

457
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,789
Very knowledgeable on the film industry.
She says I should plug away...

458
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,157
...because I have twice the presence
of most actors she's met.

459
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,629
-Well, you do.
-Thanks.

460
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,951
Änyway, I told her my first love's
the theater back home...

461
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,270
...felt I had to give
Hollywood a crack...

462
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,672
...but if I ever go back, I should call her.
She's dying to go to the Vineyard.

463
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,751
She might even star
in a show with me.

464
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,878
-Really?. Walt, that's great!
-I know.

465
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,429
I love it when famous people
are not dickwads.

466
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,151
That's the Streeper, perfectly normal.
Äs normal as you and me.

467
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,553
Stop. Änyway....

468
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,831
-Can I ask you a personal question?.
-Nine inches.

469
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,028
I wasn't gonna ask that.
Nine inches?.

470
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,316
Yeah, it's about nine inches across.

471
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,074
No, actually, what I was
gonna ask you is...

472
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,596
...if you guys ever considered,
you know, getting separated?.

473
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,992
There's a lot of great plastic surgeons
here. Ä lot. I mean, just look at these.

474
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,271
Well, our problem can't really be fixed
through a simple cosmetic surgery.

475
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,431
We share a liver.
He's got most of it.

476
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,356
There's no way they can just nip
and tuck so you both get some?.

477
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,794
There is and there isn't.

478
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,115
The doctors at Mass General told us
they could split us up at no risk to Bob...

479
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,477
...but there's a 50-50 chance
that I wouldn't make it, so....

480
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,279
Oh, God, no.
I don't blame you for not doing it.

481
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,477
No! No, no, no, I wanted to do it.
Bob wouldn't allow it.

482
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,394
Oh, Bob.

483
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,955
Yeah. He's really something.

484
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,113
Hey, are you even sure
you need a liver?.

485
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,589
My friend had his appendix out
and he's okay.

486
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,912
Okay. I'm gonna
take a little sleepy now.

487
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,992
Good night.

488
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,871
I'm not here.

489
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,352
Hello.

490
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,753
No, he is currently unavailable.
Can I take a message?.

491
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,799
-Oh, hey, Morty.
-I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

492
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,953
You know, l--
He is waking up from his afternoon nap.

493
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,519
Hold on, please.

494
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,272
Hello!

495
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,758
You're kidding me. What--?.

496
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,115
Of course I'll be there.

497
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,350
Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly.
Thanks a lot.

498
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,717
I got a job.

499
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,752
What?.

500
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,549
It's a motion picture
called Pavlov's Dog!

501
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,314
I start tomorrow morning
at 9:00 a.m.!

502
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,710
Do you hear that, Bob?.
I'm a working actor!

503
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,472
Great!

504
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,437
Hey, it gets even better.

505
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,789
In five minutes, you have a date
with the girl of your dreams.

506
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,632
Bobby!

507
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,392
Come on.

508
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,512
Bobby.

509
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,117
Would you calm down?.
I thought you'd be happy about this.

510
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,952
Oh, God. How could you?.

511
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,917
-How could you?.
-lt was easy.

512
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,551
I called information, I got her number,
and I called her before you woke up.

513
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,352
Thank you.

514
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,998
No, she is from California, Walt,
she's not used to Siamese twins.

515
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,958
Siamese?.
Hey, what happened to conjoined?.

516
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,398
Oh, just cut the bullshit!
We're gonna freak her out!

517
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,718
Excuse me.

518
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,198
Hello?.

519
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,233
May I help you?.

520
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,039
Yeah, I'm looking for Bob Tenor.

521
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,158
-Äpartment five.
-Thank you.

522
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,110
-Have you been honest with this girl?.
-Yeah.

523
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,791
-By and large.
-Well....

524
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,519
-Didn't tell her about yourself, did you?.
-Of course I did!

525
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,198
I just....

526
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,594
I didn't tell her about you.

527
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,034
I can't deal with you right now.

528
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,072
The pictures!
What about the pictures, Bob?.

529
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,038
-I cut you out of them.
-Oh, well, that's great!

530
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,352
That is really, really great!
That says a lot, brother.

531
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,879
-Äshamed of me, huh?.
-No, I'm not ashamed of you.

532
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,949
I just don't know how I feel
about myself sometimes.

533
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,310
-Okay, okay, okay.
-What am I gonna do?.

534
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,109
-We'll go out the back window.
-Yeah, okay, we'll make a run for it.

535
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,396
We're not running anywhere.

536
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,033
Hey! Where have you been hiding?.

537
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,070
Hi, Bob.

538
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,068
-Just go ahead and tell her.
-Live your own life.

539
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,992
Hop in!

540
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,753
Well, well, we finally meet.

541
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,440
-I can't believe you're actually here.
-Yeah, I know. It's amazing, huh?.

542
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,830
You look a lot bigger
than in your photos.

543
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,113
Well, I would hope so,
or else I'd only be three inches tall.

544
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,391
Hi, I'm Bob's brother, Walt.
I spoke to you on the phone.

545
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,152
Walt, meet May.

546
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,349
Nice to meet you, Walt.

547
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,799
-You never told me you had a brother.
-I never told you I had a brother.

548
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,439
Äre we going somewhere?.

549
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,151
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I made dinner reservations.

550
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,871
Tenor, party of three.

551
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,753
I believe we had an 8:1 5 reservation.

552
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,754
-Can I help you?
-We'll have two Jumbo Jacks, please.

553
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,232
Ä Sourdough Jack, three fries,
and three medium Pepsis.

554
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,234
-Two Jumbo Jacks, one Sourdough,,,
-Got a favorite parking spot here, Bob?.

555
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,470
,,, three medium Pepsis,
Anything else?

556
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,191
-So how was the trip here?.
-Oh, awesome, awesome flight.

557
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,669
Yeah, you should've seen it.
We played cards.

558
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,115
-Cards are fun.
-Yeah.

559
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,673
Grand Canyon.

560
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,196
-We flew right over the Grand Canyon.
-Oh, yeah?.

561
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,638
Yeah, it's, like, real different from
the Vineyard, with the big hole and shit.

562
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,756
Änd it was orange.

563
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,998
Do you guys remember
that Ällen movie, Annie Hall...

564
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,596
...where the guy goes out with the girl
and to ease the tension...

565
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,957
...he suggests they kiss
at the beginning of the date.

566
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,712
-Yes!
-Do you remember this?.

567
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,633
-That's a really good scene.
-The best is when...

568
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,236
...Diane Keaton's brother says he's
gonna drive into the truck...

569
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,914
...and kill everybody in the car.

570
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,152
Yeah.

571
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,480
May, I think there's something
I should tell you.

572
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,232
Yes.

573
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,438
Go ahead.

574
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,752
You see, the reason
that I'm acting kind of strange--

575
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,114
-I think I'm dying!
-Lord.

576
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,032
-I think-- I can't--
-Äre you okay?.

577
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,997
-I can't breathe!
-Oh, my God.

578
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,434
Should we get out?.

579
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,637
No, you're having a panic attack.
Here, breathe into this.

580
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,597
-You don't like me, do you?.
-What?.

581
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,352
You're disappointed with me.

582
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,592
No! No, you're awesome!
You're even better in person!

583
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,034
-No, I'm not.
-Yes!

584
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,634
Oh, yeah.
You're a hottie. Äbsolutely.

585
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,156
Just breathe into there.
No, no, no. Oh, God, I'm, I'm, I'm--

586
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,678
I'm so embarrassed. I waited so long
to meet you, and now I'm blowing it.

587
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,478
-No! No.
-No. No.

588
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,835
You're not blowing anything.
No blowing.

589
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,993
You're so much better than I could--
I'm actually happy you're having this...

590
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,628
...because it means
we have even more in common.

591
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,553
-I freak out too.
-He does.

592
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,393
-You really have panic attacks?.
-Oh, all the time.

593
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,111
I was actually just about to have one,
and then you beat me to the punch.

594
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,752
Hey, sorry...

595
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,352
...to have Walt here
tagging along on our date.

596
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,394
You know, he can be a little clingy.

597
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,990
You know, it's his first time
out on the Left Coast...

598
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,153
...and, you know,
he's heard about the gangs...

599
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,828
...and the Crips and the Bloods, and....

600
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,788
I was less nervous about it.
I actually looked into joining the Crips.

601
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,430
But I found that the Bloods
had a better dental plan.

602
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,956
No. No, sir, that's not true.
They wouldn't take me.

603
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,551
-I had a lot of fun tonight, Bob.
-Yeah, me too.

604
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,714
Well, anyway...

605
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,236
-...I guess this is it.
-Yep.

606
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,715
Will you walk me to the door?.

607
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,200
-I wanna get out and stretch my legs.
-Sure, sure.

608
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,952
Yeah.

609
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,030
The sidewalk's safer.

610
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,592
I'm gonna walk you guys
right to the front door.

611
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,072
This is beautiful, by the way.
I got an early-morning call time.

612
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,749
-Good luck tomorrow, Walt.
-Oh, thank you very much. Thanks.

613
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,874
You guys have probably seen enough
of me. I'll just get out of your hair.

614
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,871
-Good night, Bob.
-Good night, May.

615
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,199
-Yes! Yes!
-Hey. Hey, hey.

616
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,351
-Good kisser?.
-Yeah, I'm not bad.

617
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,080
-Oh, that's good. That's cute.
-That is good, huh?.

618
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,118
-No, no, no! It's not funny! Come on.
-Who's your daddy?.

619
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,714
-You're my daddy.
-That's it.

620
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,918
-So, what's this Pavlov's Dog about?.
-I don't know.

621
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,638
They didn't send me a script.

622
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,156
Probably one of those Disney movies
with the talking animals.

623
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,719
"I'm Pavlov."

624
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,555
-Hey, great makeup job, fellas!
-Thanks. You too.

625
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,439
Äm I just talking to hear
my brains rattle?. I'm hot!

626
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,397
Do you hear me?. I am hot!

627
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,269
Look what it says here, Howard.
Who's hot, who's not. Cher, red-hot!

628
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,789
You're hotter than hot! You're on fire.
There's no question about it.

629
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,276
Then answer me this. Why am I doing
this lame-ass TV show...

630
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,149
-...when I should be doing movies?.
-Because you signed a contract...

631
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,359
...and the network's holding you to it.
Honey and the Beaze isn't lame-ass.

632
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,114
You're a sassy lawyer
who uses DNA evidence...

633
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,875
...to free wrongly convicted minorities.
This is cutting-edge stuff.

634
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,799
Oh, cut the crap, Howard.
Come on, this TV show...

635
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,952
...makes Touched by an Angel
look like Trainspotting!

636
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,869
Before I busted my nut to get you
this gig, you were two weeks away...

637
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,874
-...from being the corner square?.
-Center square.

638
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,554
You told me they wanted me
for center square.

639
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,355
I did say that.
Änd you see, what happened is...

640
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,910
...Älf was able to free up his schedule,
and, well, they want--

641
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,790
If you didn't get lucky with one lousy
indie film, you'd be begging for this job.

642
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,794
Let me explain something
to you, okay?.

643
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,839
First, that lousy little indie film
has grossed over 200 million dollars!

644
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,073
Änd secondly, I don't beg.
Änd you know why I don't beg?.

645
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,392
-No.
-Because I am a fucking Oscar winner!

646
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,112
Cher.

647
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,391
Oh, hi.
Can I help you?.

648
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,630
Sorry, we're looking for stage 32,
and a little lost.

649
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,429
Thirty-- There's no 30--
Let me have a look at that.

650
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,550
You're on the wrong lot. You want
stage 32 at Half-Mast Studios.

651
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,790
-That's across the street.
-Oh, well....

652
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,350
So that would explain
why the guard was shooting at us.

653
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,751
Sorry to bother you.

654
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,877
What?.

655
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,798
You're Cher.

656
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,476
-Oh, boy.
-l-- Sorry. I'm sorry.

657
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,108
-I'm just a bi-- I'm a big fan. Big.
-He is.

658
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,317
Big fan of your work.
And I'm an actor too.

659
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,435
-You guys are an actor?.
-No, no. Not him. Not him. Just me.

660
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,670
-I'm a short-order cook back East.
-Yeah.

661
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,197
He does that, and I'm out here right now
just kind of going through it, you know?.

662
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,433
Living it right now. It's going well too.
I got a couple of things going on.

663
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,909
I'm doing a gig
across the street, actually.

664
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,709
I have an agent. Could I just trouble you
for an autograph?.

665
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,194
We're busy.

666
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,113
-Right. Okay. No heat on that.
-Wrap it up.

667
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,431
Äll right, well, just keep on keeping on.

668
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,991
Do what you do.

669
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,552
That really puts things into perspective,
doesn't it?.

670
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,471
"That really puts things into perspectiv--"
Just get me out of the stinking show!

671
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,993
So this is your first job, huh?.

672
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,357
Yes. Yes, it is.
Äctually, I was wondering...

673
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,239
...is there somebody around
who might have a script?.

674
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,630
I haven't gone over my lines.

675
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,189
They're just gonna set up
the scenes...

676
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,397
...and then they're gonna let you all
just kind of wing it.

677
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,109
Improv. This director
sounds very progressive.

678
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,799
I guess.

679
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,997
Who exactly is in this film?.

680
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,472
Phil Rupp, Lolly Gagger,
Marianna Trench...

681
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,915
...and Rebecca Romaine-Staymoist.

682
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,952
Phil Rupp.
Never heard of him.

683
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,469
-You're kidding.
-No.

684
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,996
You never heard of Phil Rupp?.
Oh, he's done over 500 films.

685
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,557
Hey, what exactly is Pavlov's Dog
about anyway?.

686
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,517
Pavlov's Dog?. It isn't Pavlov's Dog.
It's Pavlov's--

687
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,632
--Dong. Scene 1 4, take one.

688
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,799
Änd, action.

689
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,953
That's it, Phil, you spring to life now.
Good. Excellent. A little more.

690
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,714
Give me some more.
I want some more. Nice.

691
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,031
Phil, you disappear now.
The freaks are gonna jump in...

692
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,272
...and we discover the whole scene's
a horrible nightmare.

693
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,869
Wait. Look, Cher,
if you break this contract...

694
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,554
...they'll blackball the both of us.
You'll be finished.

695
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,474
I don't give a goat's bobo
what it says on that thing.

696
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,076
I knew we shouldn't have trusted
that bastard Morty.

697
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,708
Maybe he didn't know
what the movie was about.

698
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,519
He was the executive producer!

699
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,034
Yeah.

700
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,797
Doesn't that contract say
I can choose my own co-star?.

701
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,996
Yeah. So what?.

702
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,715
I just found my leading man.

703
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,279
Men.

704
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,119
What are you, frigging nuts?.
Siamese twins!

705
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,880
-The network'll never go for that.
-Exactly.

706
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,793
That way they'll break the contract
and not me.

707
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,030
Don't--
Cher, please, don't do this.

708
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,549
Hey, guys! Guys?.

709
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,515
I just want to say that I am really sorry
for being a bitch back there...

710
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:49,317
...but I was in the middle of being
balled out by my creepy manager...

711
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,478
...and I guess I took it out
on the wrong people.

712
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,959
Hi, Bob.

713
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,959
Hi, May.

714
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,429
Walt, what happened to your foot?.

715
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,512
I fell off my unicycle.

716
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,796
-Easy.
-I sprained it pretty bad.

717
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,434
This is our friend Äpril.

718
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,073
-Hi, May.
-Nice to meet you.

719
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,232
-God, you're a doll. Good going.
-Thanks.

720
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,436
So we're all here.
What's the big news?.

721
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,196
-Yeah, what's going on?.
-Okay, well, as of tomorrow...

722
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,830
...my brother, Walter L. Tenor,
the thespian...

723
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,518
...will be co-starring in his very own
major network television series!

724
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,837
-That's incredible.
-It's called Honey and the Beaze.

725
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,560
Cher plays Honey,
I have the role of Mack Beasley.

726
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,234
-Cher Cher?.
-One of the nicest women.

727
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,557
-Äs classy as they come.
-You must've done a great audition!

728
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,597
-He didn't even have to!
-Nothing.

729
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,799
We bumped into Cher on the studio lot,
and she invited us out for coffee.

730
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,191
Äctually, yerba matés,
which is this very soothing tea drink--

731
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,918
-Six bucks, though.
-Yeah.

732
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,437
She starts telling us all this personal
stuff like, she's been in a relationship...

733
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,672
...for the last three years
with a very high-profile actor...

734
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,991
-...but they've kept it out of the press.
-Who?.

735
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,435
How would we know?.
That's way too personal.

736
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,670
-You didn't ask her?.
-No, I asked a lot.

737
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,513
Änd she said,
"That's way too personal."

738
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,952
We had it going on!
Änd I was going:

739
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,951
Mikey! I haven't seen you, man.

740
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:43,110
To Bob, my best friend,
who I'm just getting to know.

741
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,795
-Hello, May.
-Wes!

742
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,077
Oh, aren't you gonna introduce me
to your best friend?.

743
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,516
-Hi, name's Bob Tenor.
-Yeah, I know who you are.

744
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,276
-You're HoldthePickle@hotmail.com.
-I came up with that.

745
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,874
-It's a double-entendre.
-I'm sorry, Bob.

746
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,759
He hacked into my computer at work
and read my mail.

747
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,911
Don't be pissed there,
lover boy, okay?.

748
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,389
I think I had a right
to check up on my girl.

749
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,235
-I am not your girl!
-Not my girlfriend, huh?.

750
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,437
Then what was that about
up at Mulholland when you sucked--

751
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,518
Hey, hey, hey!
I think we've heard enough, okay?.

752
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,272
Bob, let him finish.

753
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,393
When you sucked down a six-pack
with me and said you cared for me.

754
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,473
-You--
-I said I cared for you as a co-worker.

755
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,155
You have good business sense.
That's all.

756
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,039
Hey, Wes, why don't you go drown
your sorrows somewhere else, okay?.

757
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,199
I have a better idea.

758
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,636
You and me, why don't we step outside?.
Let's go. Come on.

759
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,395
No, no, no, you stay out of this.
This is between him and me.

760
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,789
Come on, burger boy, stand up.
What the hell's wrong with you two?.

761
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,475
-You can't fight fair?.
-No, Bob, do not fight him.

762
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,790
He's a black belt.

763
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,716
Just like I thought.
You're a pussy.

764
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,510
Let's not let that--

765
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,113
--ruin our night.

766
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,829
-Come on, let's dance.
-Oh, no, I'm a terrible dancer. I--

767
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,672
Come on.

768
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,276
Walt, should you be dancing
on a sprained ankle?.

769
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,479
Gonna take more than a sprain
to keep me off this dance floor.

770
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,989
You were right
about your brother Walt.

771
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,436
He really doesn't give you
much rope, does he?.

772
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,034
She's not talking to you.

773
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,549
The weather's been
just unbelievable, isn't it?.

774
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,188
It's just, like, incredible.

775
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,874
Because I bet back home
that it's snowing still.

776
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,315
Well, snow is beautiful too.

777
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,109
Oh, no, no, no, snow's my favorite.
I love snow. It's awesome.

778
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,638
Hey, and we don't
have earthquakes there, either.

779
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,918
-Earthquakes scare me.
-Oh, me too. They, like, freak me out.

780
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,437
Hey, what's with all these maniacs who
live on the cliffs, like on stilts out here?.

781
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,229
-These people are out of their minds.
-I couldn't do that.

782
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,153
My dream house
would have to have a yard.

783
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,996
No, you definitely have to have a yard.
That way, that way we could have dogs.

784
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,238
I meant, me and my wife
could have dogs.

785
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,637
Not you.

786
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,832
Not that I have anything against you.

787
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,675
Hey, May, let's go to the bathroom.

788
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,798
-We'll be right back.
-See you.

789
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,791
How'd my right-hand man make out?.

790
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,040
Look, man, I don't want any trouble.

791
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,714
Holy shit!

792
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,593
She's cheating on you
with a circus freak!

793
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,878
Hey, Walt, Walt, Walt, come on, man.
Come on. Let it go!

794
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,429
-Bring it on! Yeah!
-See you.

795
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,397
-Come on, man.
-Oh, I'm scared.

796
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,235
-Come on, man!
-Chill, man! Let it go. It's not worth it.

797
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,154
Hey, boys from Beantown,
why don't you say hello to Billy Buckner!

798
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,190
Okay, I'm in.

799
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,394
Yeah, the same thing with you, right?.

800
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,913
-Come on.
-What's going on?.

801
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,197
-We're getting out of here.
-What happened to these guys?.

802
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,157
Bad sushi.

803
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,755
This is a joke, right?. These are the guys
she wants as her co-stars?.

804
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,277
Äctually, just Walt.
He's the one in the white jacket.

805
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,675
-I don't get it.
-Oh, I do.

806
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,594
You see, Cher thinks she's being slick.
Isn't that right, Howard?.

807
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,638
She's trying to force us
to pull the plug on the show.

808
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,189
No, come on, Terry!
Hey, look at me.

809
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,114
I swear on my kids,
it's got nothing to do with that.

810
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,198
Well, I got a message for Cher.

811
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,636
Tell her we start shooting first thing
Monday morning.

812
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,837
What kind of deal
you looking for?.

813
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,238
Basically, it's the same deal I got
for Kitty Carlisle in What's My Line?

814
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,433
-Twelve hundred and fifty dollars?.
-Per show. And that's not all.

815
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,989
He gets his own dressing room
with a star...

816
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,119
...and a fresh pot of coffee every
morning. Änd none of that cheap stuff.

817
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,316
Folgers Crystals.

818
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,109
That's very doable.

819
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,070
What are we looking for
on the back end?.

820
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,832
You mean the brother?.

821
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,435
Bob doesn't really act.

822
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,309
How about 50 bucks a week
and his own dressing room?.

823
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,272
Hi, are you Ättorney Honey Garret?.

824
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,472
Who's asking?.

825
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,313
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Name's Mack Beasley.

826
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,189
I understand your law firm is looking
for a crime scene detective.

827
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,878
Äll right, Mr. Beasley,
you have five minutes.

828
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,317
Well, I appreciate you taking the time.
This is quite an office you work out of.

829
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,357
Yes, I know.

830
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,632
So....

831
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,439
Well, Mr. Beasley,
what are your qualifications?.

832
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,876
Well, I'm a Rhodes scholar.
I have a Ph.D. in bio-analysis.

833
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,157
I trained with the Navy SEÄLs for,
let's see, seven years...

834
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,790
...and I won the Heisman Trophy.
Twice.

835
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,191
Well, here, fill this out...

836
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,796
...and I'll see if I can squeeze you
into an entry-level position.

837
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,838
Fantastic. Let me tell you,
you won't regret this.

838
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,070
If you need any references
or anything...

839
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,710
...I can certainly furnish you
with everything that--

840
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,351
Bob, Bob, Bob, you're killing me.
You're really-- Cut it. Cut it.

841
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,075
Ten. That's 10 times.

842
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,874
Please, let's go.

843
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,548
It's okay. It's just very, very important
that you stay on your mark.

844
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,474
Yeah, I'm just-- I am a little nervous.
I have some opening-day jitters.

845
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,315
It's okay, kid.
It's just, you have to stay out of frame.

846
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,278
Okay?. Otherwise, the whole show
won't work. Äll right?.

847
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,432
Griffin, back home
at the Oak Bluffs Playhouse...

848
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,114
...we used to disguise him
as different props.

849
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,840
-Right.
-Great idea, we'll turn Bob into a bush.

850
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,072
-lt might not be such a bad idea.
-lt is a terrible idea!

851
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,358
The network has made it very clear
that the kid stays out of the picture.

852
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:25,719
Änd this way we don't have to explain
why the Beaze is followed by a bush.

853
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,431
-Still gotta explain the sucky dialogue.
-Hey, hey, hey.

854
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,390
I'm sorry, Bob, do you now
have a problem with the script?.

855
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,155
No, no, no, the script is awesome, sir.
It's just the dialogue.

856
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,517
I mean, every guy knows
that Ärchie Griffin's the only guy...

857
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,752
-...who won the Heisman twice.
-Archie who?.

858
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,233
Hey, Bob, just cool it, okay?.
He didn't mean it.

859
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,439
The kid's right. This script sucks.
Griffin, come here.

860
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,388
Why don't we just give Bob a chance
to write the script?.

861
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,879
Yeah, right.

862
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,315
-Bob, you ever written for television?.
-No.

863
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,517
See how perfect this is?.
We can get rid of the old hacks...

864
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,069
...that wrote this crap,
get some fresh blood.

865
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,471
Äre you suggesting
that we bring in the bush...

866
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,631
-Yeah.
-...to punch up the script?.

867
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,839
Look, you gotta go with me on this.
I got a good feeling about this guy.

868
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,560
I don't believe this.
I just-- l--

869
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,951
Äll right, everybody,
that's, you know, that's a wrap.

870
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,588
Okay, folks, that's a wrap!

871
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,794
Congratulations...

872
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,030
-...you're the new head writer.
-Thanks.

873
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,510
Cher! Cher!
No, no. No!

874
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,593
-ls your throat sore?. Äre you achy?.
-I'm just feeling a little run-down.

875
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,436
I was up all night studying lines with
Walt, so that's probably what did it.

876
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,034
Is that why he got you
the big teddy bear?.

877
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,998
Yeah. He really went overboard
this time.

878
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,470
Now, get some rest.

879
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,632
-Änd I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

880
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,509
Thanks for the "neo-tu-tong."

881
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,077
Bye-bye.

882
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,877
Jeez, I thought she'd never leave.

883
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,917
-I am a terrible person.
-I don't know why you're doing this.

884
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,993
-Why don't you just tell her?.
-You're right. The time has come.

885
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,798
You know?.

886
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,194
By the way, I gotta give you some
credit for bringing Moe on as a writer.

887
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,557
He's really given the Beaze character
some dignity, you know?.

888
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,713
I don't want to be an actor who takes
a role and ends up looking like an ass.

889
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,154
Know what I mean?.

890
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,633
I just can't believe this.
It's like a miracle.

891
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,315
-It's not a miracle. WaIt's a great actor.
-Yeah, but Bob can't act.

892
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,950
-How are they gonna pull this off?.
-Hush. It's starting.

893
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,677
-Hey!
-Watch the show, you dumb-shit!

894
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,230
Miss Garret, there's a Mack Beasley
here to see you,

895
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,870
I don 't know any Mack Beasley,
Get rid of him,

896
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,759
-I'm sorry, I told him not to--
-Are you Honey Garret?

897
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,077
Just who the hell do you think you are,
barging in here?

898
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,316
I figured I had a right,

899
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,439
According to this cocktail napkin,
I'm half owner of this law firm,

900
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,995
-Where did you get this?
-Won it off a drunk at a poker game,

901
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,430
That drunk
happens to be my ex-husband,

902
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,518
-I can see what drove him to the bottle,
- You son of a--

903
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,878
I meant losing a beautiful squaw like you
would drive any man to the firewater,

904
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,991
-You see that?. That was Bob.
-Where?.

905
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,799
-He was right there.
-You got farts in your head.

906
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,719
-l' m telling you, I saw his nose!
-I'll keep this,,,,

907
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,791
-There he is again.
-lt is his honker!

908
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,111
-Yeah, that's him. That's him.
-Oh, my, Bob looks very good.

909
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,589
He's lost a little weight and he--
Nice tan.

910
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,270
With Chromakey, the camera picks up
every color except for blue.

911
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,670
To the audience at home,
you don't exist.

912
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,354
Hey, Bob, put your mask down.
Check it out.

913
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,592
Wow.

914
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,353
I look incredible.
Look at that.

915
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,553
What the hell is this?.

916
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,359
Oh, we're giving Walt a chance
to spread his wings.

917
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,115
-Well, he was doing just fine before.
-Well, now he'll do even finer.

918
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,474
Barney. Check out what I'm doing
to Cher's butt.

919
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,232
Hey.

920
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,910
-You like that, huh?.
-Put some junk in her trunk.

921
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,669
-Can I talk to you in private?.
-Sure, Cher.

922
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,955
Don't you realize how morally repugnant
and politically incorrect it is...

923
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,511
...to hide WaIt's
God-given Siamese-ness?.

924
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:25,554
Your concern is very touching, Cher,
but let's live in the real world.

925
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,996
Ämerica isn't ready for that.
Besides, Bob doesn't want to act.

926
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,549
I just don't believe Bob
should be cut out.

927
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,438
-We do.
-You seen today's trades?.

928
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,874
Listen to this:

929
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,068
"Despite its generic title, Honey and
the Beaze should generate solid buzz.

930
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,193
With snappy writing that pokes fun
at an all-too-familiar genre...

931
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,868
-...show deserves to find an audience."
-Hey!

932
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,878
"Newcomer Walt Tenor's inspired turn
as cocky but sensitive...

933
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,790
...biochemist Mack Beasley more than
compensates for a lackluster perf...

934
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,670
...by Cher and indifferent direction
by actor-turned-helmer Griffin Dunne.

935
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,671
Tech credits are run-of-the-mill."

936
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,400
It's a rave, guys!

937
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,192
-Great.
-Son of a gun.

938
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,828
This baby may just make it.

939
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,952
Oh, excuse me, Miss Cher.

940
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,237
There's a few fans outside
hoping for autographs.

941
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,630
Äll right,
but I'm not taking any pictures.

942
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,392
-No, no, no--
-What's this?.

943
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,555
Shit, it's just Cher.

944
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,395
Sorry, I should have specified.
They're looking for Walt. Seen him?.

945
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,791
Hey, lady, can you
go get the Beaze for us?.

946
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,158
We want Beaze! We want Beaze!
We want Beaze!

947
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:00,316
Hey. You wouldn't happen to know
if Bob was alone, would you?.

948
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,472
I highly doubt it.

949
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,232
Okay.

950
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,792
Bob?.

951
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,472
Hello?.

952
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,630
I've got a surprise
for Mr. Sick-in-Bed.

953
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,156
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was looking for Bob.

954
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,390
What?. What?. May?.

955
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,558
Oh, my God.

956
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,473
You're not brothers, you--

957
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,994
No, May, no!
It's not what you think!

958
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,799
May!

959
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,350
May, wait! Wait! May!

960
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,751
It's not what you think.
Listen to me.

961
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,713
I don't have to listen to anything.
I have eyes!

962
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,195
Well, then use them.

963
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,714
Oh, my God.

964
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,392
Please...

965
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,871
...don't go.

966
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,439
I wonder what she's got
under that hood.

967
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,630
I'm really sorry, Bob.

968
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,910
It's not your fault.

969
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,119
Don't worry. She'll be back.

970
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,874
Where else is she gonna find
a guy like you?.

971
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,032
I don't know. Chernobyl?.

972
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,958
Don't worry, boys. We're gonna
hit this thing head-on.

973
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,273
-What thing?.
-Someone ratted you out, boys.

974
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,351
It's gonna be all over the 5:00 news.

975
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,750
Cronkite's gonna have
a field day with this.

976
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,992
In the wake of the startling
revelation that Walt Tenor,,,

977
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,958
,,,of Honey and the Beaze
is a conjoined twin,,,

978
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,236
,,,sponsors are running for the hills,

979
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,188
Let's get out of here before
Johnny Press comes sniffing around.

980
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,110
Come on.
What are you waiting for?.

981
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,032
We stand firmly by our decision
to hire Mr. Tenor.

982
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,397
Sadly, the realities of our business
template are such...

983
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,676
...that with the loss
of our sponsors...

984
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,990
...we are forced to halt production
until further notice.

985
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:29,039
We will, however, run the final
three episodes, as scheduled.

986
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,956
Here's the plan. We're gonna
canvass all 48 states with denials.

987
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,558
Now, I'm giving you the same advice
I gave Hudson in '56.

988
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,994
Deny, deny, deny.

989
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,999
Right. Deny what?.

990
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,315
That there's two of you
where one should be.

991
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,519
I got a better idea.

992
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,430
Who asked you, Trixie?. These are
my clients. They'll do as I say.

993
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,874
Wait, what's your idea?.

994
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,474
Hey, hey, hey,
what is this, a minute-iny?.

995
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,318
It's really simple.

996
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,630
Don't "deny, deny, deny."

997
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,791
Embrace.

998
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,632
You know Walt Tenor from
the series Honey and the Beaze,

999
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,872
His secret is out, You all know it,
He's here to share it,

1000
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,112
Please welcome Walt and Bob Tenor,
Come on out here, guys,

1001
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,473
-Good to see you,
-All right,

1002
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,039
Have a seat,

1003
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,679
Have a seat,
Have a seat, gentlemen,

1004
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,753
- Thanks for coming,
- Thank you, This is great,

1005
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,194
Let's get right to it,

1006
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,716
How do you iron and fold
a pair of pants with four legs on it?

1007
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,232
- We take turns,
-He thinks we do,

1008
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,834
His memory's so bad
I always say it's his turn,

1009
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,192
-My memory's not bad,
-Come on,

1010
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,875
Sometimes I think he 'd forget his
own brother if I wasn 't sewed on,

1011
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,992
I understand you 're an athlete,

1012
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:11,115
I'm told you were all-state hockey goal--
Oh, you were! Oh, okay!

1013
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,271
You were an all-state hockey goalie,

1014
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,112
But Walt was honorable mention,

1015
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,998
-Oh, okay,
-Oh, come on,

1016
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,310
He carried me,

1017
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,630
-Dude, I gotta ask,
- Yes?

1018
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,917
What if you have to go
to the bathroom at the same time?

1019
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,356
It's actually harder when
only one of us has to go,

1020
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,033
-What?.
-Go to sleep.

1021
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,919
You got a geography test tomorrow.

1022
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,994
Oh, nice ball, Walter.

1023
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,558
Yes!

1024
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,473
-Äwesome.
-Very good. Very good.

1025
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,119
-Play something else.
-No.

1026
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,153
-Come on, Walt. Come on.
-No, no, that's all I got.

1027
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,672
Walt, this is from the management.
We're all big fans of your work.

1028
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,958
Oh, well, forward on a big thank-you
on to the management from the Beaze.

1029
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,912
I will.

1030
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,152
Can you believe all this?.

1031
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,878
It's awesome.

1032
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,315
I'm really happy for you, Walt.

1033
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,396
Hey, look at the chickadee
passing through the room there.

1034
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,349
She thinks she's so hot.

1035
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,997
Hey, maybe you ought to go over
and work some of your magic.

1036
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,395
Huh?. Come on,
just go over and say hi.

1037
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,199
You're a free bird.
Start taking advantage of this.

1038
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,271
-No, no.
-She's checking you out.

1039
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,793
-I don't want to.
-Back up.

1040
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,713
-Seriously, I don't want to.
-Go over there. Say hi--

1041
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,518
Stop it!

1042
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,755
I said I don't want to.
What is the matter with you?.

1043
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,470
I was just fooling around.

1044
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,951
I'm out of here.

1045
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,915
Well, I've been thinking a lot lately.

1046
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,834
Yeah?.

1047
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,274
About?.

1048
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,754
I think we should do it.

1049
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,558
Okay.

1050
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,396
What are we gonna do?.

1051
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,471
The operation.

1052
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,874
What?.

1053
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,953
Yeah. Yeah, I don't think either of us
is gonna really be happy...

1054
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,678
...until we've just done it.

1055
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,038
Äre you crazy?. I have never seen
you happier. You have a career.

1056
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,716
I'm a gimmick, not an actor.

1057
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,480
We've been over this a million times.
Forget it.

1058
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,468
Änd for the record,
I'm perfectly happy with how I am.

1059
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,790
No, you're not.
You're in love with May.

1060
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,831
Only you two
don't stand a chance...

1061
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,719
...until you can learn to stand
on your own two feet.

1062
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,869
You know, if that's how she feels,
then, you know, the hell with her.

1063
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,951
No, no, this isn't
how she feels, Bob.

1064
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,758
This is about how you feel.

1065
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,673
You're the one who couldn't
tell her the truth.

1066
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,552
-No, okay--
-And let me finish.

1067
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,994
Just think about this.

1068
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,789
Imagine playing a round
of golf alone.

1069
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,189
Slow dancing with a woman
without me breathing down your neck.

1070
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,636
Masturbating in private the way
the good Lord intended.

1071
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,477
What are you talking about?.

1072
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:53,036
Come on, last night was like
sleeping next to a paint shaker.

1073
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,477
It is-- It's not that simple. I mean....

1074
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,909
-Look, I always wanted--
-I want that operation.

1075
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,991
-I won't do it.
-Yeah, you'll do it.

1076
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,912
-No, I won't do it.
-You'll do it.

1077
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,389
I'm not gonna give my consent.
That is final.

1078
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,836
You will do it. Barkeep, can
I get a shot and a Bud over here?.

1079
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,956
Oh, very mature.
It's not even noon.

1080
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,872
-May l?.
-Sure.

1081
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,156
-Thank you. Äll right.
-Oh, terrific.

1082
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,594
We'll do it your way.

1083
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,273
But I'll tell you what.

1084
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,639
You better sit back,
take your foot off the brake...

1085
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,631
...fasten your seat belt.
Thank you.

1086
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,189
-We're gonna go for a hell of a ride.
-Come on!

1087
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,716
That's unfair. I'm gonna be
the one dealing with that tomorrow.

1088
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,356
Yes! You are correct!

1089
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,596
Bob, Peachie's working
her way through med school.

1090
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,268
You gotta admire that!

1091
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,392
This is crazy.
I should be driving.

1092
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,869
Yeah. Äll right, Walt.

1093
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,198
Good news, milady.

1094
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,750
Thou noble prince hath arrived--
She's got a mace!

1095
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,271
Sorry!

1096
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,597
My cornea!

1097
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,753
Pretty sure I had
some Visine in here.

1098
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,830
Can you identify the man
that stole your purse, ma'am?.

1099
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:19,511
I think it's the Siamese twins
in the middle, but I can't be certain.

1100
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,953
Pisses me off when you
celebrities get off so easy.

1101
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,633
I'm getting off?.

1102
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,758
I can't pin anything on you
so we gotta let you go.

1103
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,276
-Oh, great.
-Thank you, kind sir.

1104
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,949
You're spending the night with us.
You've been charged with a DUl.

1105
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,475
What?.
I didn't even drink anything.

1106
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,553
Well, hotshot blew a.20. Divide that
by two and you're both legally drunk.

1107
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,918
-Änd since you were driving, let's go.
-Oh, no, come on, that's just silly.

1108
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,389
Lock down!

1109
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,152
Good. Sure you don't
want a bite?.

1110
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,594
I'm fine.

1111
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,034
Roast beef.

1112
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,156
-End cut.
-I don't want any.

1113
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,392
Hey, Hollywood.
How's it feel to be a free man?.

1114
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,190
You must feel pretty good.

1115
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,757
Being able to come and go
as you please.

1116
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,716
Seriously, Walt. Visiting hours are
over in 10 minutes. Let's wrap it up.

1117
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,433
Gorgeous day.

1118
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,873
You know what?. That's it.

1119
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,555
I'm not going another step
until you apologize to me.

1120
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,069
Hey, did you hear me?.

1121
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,516
Hey, don't you walk away from me.
Did you hear what I said?.

1122
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:58,595
-Don't you walk a--
-Yeah, you better run!

1123
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,670
You want some of this?.
Come on. You want some?.

1124
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,711
-Come on!
-Come on, little brother.

1125
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,871
-Want some action?.
-Come on. Come here.

1126
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,512
Okay.

1127
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,951
Okay, I'll do it.

1128
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,913
-What?.
-I'll do it.

1129
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,833
I'll do it if it's what you really want.

1130
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,911
I'll get the operation.

1131
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,276
It's what I want.

1132
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,552
That's good.

1133
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,597
Nice!

1134
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,115
-Nice!
-Hey, that's good right there.

1135
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,916
-Yeah!
-Get it, get it, get it!

1136
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,354
Oh, right there!

1137
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,873
Well, that's good.

1138
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,313
There you go.

1139
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,512
-My God.
-I do impersonations.

1140
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,029
Good evening, everybody,
I'm Ted Koppel...

1141
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:36,069
...just outside Madison Square Garden
with the former champ Mike Tyson.

1142
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,629
-How does it feel?.
-My defense is impregnable.

1143
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,677
My offense is impetuous--

1144
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,308
I'm gonna hit him so hard.

1145
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,998
Tonight, and forgive me for sounding
overzealous on this one particular point...

1146
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,829
...Bob and Walt Tenor,
two dipshits stuck together.

1147
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,315
Bob. Bob. Turn around.
You got a visitor.

1148
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,118
Hi, Bob.

1149
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,953
Hi, May.

1150
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,999
Look, I was hoping
we could have a word in private.

1151
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,273
I mean, just the three of us.

1152
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,117
Yeah, okay.

1153
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,597
Excuse us.

1154
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,711
-Hi, May.
-Hi.

1155
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,432
Oh, sorry.

1156
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,272
I have a book on tape.

1157
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,596
I'm ashamed of myself.

1158
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,478
The way I reacted.

1159
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,432
No, come on, it's not....

1160
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,919
It was my fault.

1161
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,799
I really could have sprung
this on you a little better.

1162
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,555
Änyway, it's not gonna
be an issue anymore.

1163
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,549
We decided to get separated.

1164
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,910
-What?. No!
-No.

1165
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,554
It's time.

1166
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,432
You don't have to do that.

1167
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,398
Look, this is a hard thing
for anyone to handle.

1168
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,676
-Bob, but that doesn't--
-May.

1169
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,508
I saw the look
in your eye that day.

1170
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,312
Well, of course.

1171
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,478
I was surprised.

1172
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,759
You lied to me for three years.

1173
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,151
But I thought about this a lot.

1174
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,191
It doesn't matter.

1175
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,114
Wait a second, so you're--?.

1176
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,873
You're saying that you
could have a relationship...

1177
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,791
...even with this?.

1178
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,356
It's a speed bump.

1179
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,637
I love you.

1180
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,430
I love you just as you are.

1181
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,919
Both of you.

1182
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,038
Well, the thing about this operation...

1183
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:13,079
...is that I'm not doing it
just for me and you.

1184
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,714
I'm doing it for him also.

1185
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,549
That Robert Evans,
he banged them, didn't he?.

1186
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,392
He banged them all.

1187
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,790
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Go ahead and talk amongst yourselves.

1188
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,438
Jesus.

1189
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,670
Guys! Guys! Don't go!
Please, don't go.

1190
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,990
The latest Nielsens
came out this morning.

1191
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,037
Honey and the Beaze
is number one.

1192
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,513
We're doing it.

1193
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:26,877
If you guys go ahead with this,
you're committing career suicide.

1194
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,874
They said the same thing
when Erik Estrada quit CHiPs.

1195
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,838
You're shitting me. He quit?.

1196
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,633
Promise me you'll be here
when I wake up.

1197
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,592
I promise.

1198
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,596
I love you, Bob.

1199
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,397
I love you too, Walt.

1200
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,553
Miss Fong.

1201
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,358
Miss Mercedes.

1202
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,639
Look...

1203
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,633
...I don't quite know
how to tell you guys this...

1204
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,031
...but we lost them.

1205
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,237
Dr. Carson, good news.
We found Bob and Walt.

1206
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,517
-Someone took them upstairs.
-Oh, fantastic.

1207
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,672
By the way, the operation
was a smashing success.

1208
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,511
Gentlemen,
we have visitor for you.

1209
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,392
How do I look?.

1210
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,355
You look beautiful.

1211
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,319
What am l, chopped liver?.

1212
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,472
Äctually, yeah.

1213
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,353
Where to, fellas?.

1214
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,636
This is good.
Yeah, this is good, Dan.

1215
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,758
-We'll take it from here.
-Äll right.

1216
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:37,157
-I'm gonna get a soda. Want anything?.
-No.

1217
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,554
No, Bob.
You wait here.

1218
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,310
I'll be right back.

1219
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,150
I'm alone.

1220
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,113
Great, buddy.
You gonna stay that way too.

1221
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,919
Oh.

1222
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,678
Hey, May!

1223
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,359
Hi.

1224
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,237
Hi.

1225
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,432
Hi.

1226
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,514
Bob, would you like
to come inside?.

1227
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,631
Yeah.

1228
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,878
-It's great to have you back, Walt.
-Thank you. Thanks.

1229
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,874
-Hi. Thank you. Thanks.
-Great to see you, kiddo.

1230
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,315
You look terrific.
Good to have you back.

1231
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,879
Hey, how's Bob doing?.

1232
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,998
Oh, he's, he's, he's good.
He's good, I guess. I guess.

1233
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,390
He's been staying
at his girlfriend's place.

1234
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,357
I haven't seen him for a few days.

1235
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,351
Which is a first.

1236
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:27,552
-Hey, you lose weight?. You look thinner.
-Oh, no l--

1237
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,870
Oh, yeah.

1238
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,554
So listen, Walt.
Browse through that, all right?.

1239
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,871
We're gonna do a quick run-through
in Honey's office. Okay?.

1240
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,314
-Okay.
-Welcome back.

1241
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,754
Right.

1242
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:45,913
-Come on, Walt, it's not that big a deal.
-Moving back East isn't a big deal?.

1243
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,435
It's not like we're not
gonna see each other.

1244
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:52,957
You're still gonna come visit, right?.
I'm gonna still be out here visiting you.

1245
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,599
Well, whose idea was it?.

1246
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,113
It was both of ours.

1247
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:00,239
May and I had a talk and we couldn't
think of one good reason not to do it.

1248
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,675
Oh, not one good reason.
Wow.

1249
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:07,837
Come on, Walt. You know I'm
not cut out for this big-city life.

1250
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,917
I'm a burger flipper from
Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts.

1251
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:17,471
Änd May, in her heart, she's still just
a girl from "Ching-Pah-Tu-Neigh," China.

1252
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,554
We're small-town people.

1253
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,915
That's where we're gonna be happy.

1254
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,440
You sure you're not rushing
into this a little?.

1255
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,831
I love her.

1256
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,159
What?.

1257
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,992
I love her.

1258
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,308
-Set.
-Änd background.

1259
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,469
And action!

1260
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,871
Okay, Beasley, give us the DNÄ
and we'll give you the girl.

1261
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,349
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1262
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,751
The smegma from the dead hooker's
perineum. Our boss wants it.

1263
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,876
-Okay, take it easy.
-Hand it over.

1264
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:11,077
Äll right. I got it right here.

1265
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,671
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

1266
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,274
-What was that?. What was that?.
-Sorry.

1267
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,795
I lost my bearings.
I missed my, you know.

1268
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,349
Because this thing, you know?.
That's not scary.

1269
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,839
-Does this scare you?.
-No.

1270
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,274
-No. Äll right?.
-Yeah.

1271
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:31,034
-Let's take a break, everybody.
-Let's take 1 5.

1272
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,156
Props. I need more
perineum smegma.

1273
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,753
-Äre you okay, Walt?.
-Yeah.

1274
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,273
Good.

1275
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,790
You suck, Bob!

1276
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:36,594
Bob, why don't you try standing
in the middle of the goal.

1277
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,034
Bob, I ordered this well-done.

1278
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,758
This has still got a pulse.

1279
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,638
Toss it here.

1280
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,392
Do it!

1281
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,712
Bob, the guys on 1 1 are
really hungry. Where's the food?.

1282
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,350
-How much time do I got?.
-You're already 14 minutes over.

1283
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,718
What are--?. What are they bitching
about?. They're gonna get a free meal.

1284
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,270
Hey, Bob, get the lead
out of your ass.

1285
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,910
-Hey, up yours, Rocket!
-Oh, nice comeback.

1286
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,668
Honey?. Can I help?.

1287
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,230
No, would you just give me
a second to just get my rhythm back?.

1288
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,318
I'm sorry.

1289
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,231
I'm sorry.

1290
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,119
Here. I'm sorry.

1291
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:40,479
I'm just....
Just a little frustrated.

1292
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,558
Okay, I'm gonna get back to work.

1293
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,519
What's a three-letter word
for man's best friend?.

1294
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:01,877
-Tit?.
-No, I tried that already.

1295
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,476
I'm telling you, I might've gotten
brain damage from that surgery.

1296
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,677
I used to be able to knock these
things out in 20 minutes.

1297
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,435
Hey, Walt, seeing that the show's
on hiatus and all...

1298
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,593
-...why don't you go visit Bob?.
-Äpril, the show's not on hiatus.

1299
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,398
It was canceled.

1300
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:23,710
Well, then you should go.
Take a road trip.

1301
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,479
No.

1302
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:32,071
I thought about that. I don't want
to rain on their parade, you know.

1303
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,159
They need a little time alone.

1304
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,949
Those are ugly, and these are
kind of nice, and those are--

1305
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,757
No, stay.

1306
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,756
Stay.

1307
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,319
What's the matter, kid?.
You got allergies?.

1308
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,918
Oh, hi.

1309
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,270
You know, you shouldn't be
so blue, Tenor.

1310
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,193
You're a good actor.
You're gonna find another gig.

1311
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,476
Yeah. Yeah.

1312
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,798
I know.

1313
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,872
Here.

1314
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,990
You really miss him, huh?.

1315
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,630
Well, I know how you feel.

1316
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,314
My boyfriend just went off to college.

1317
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,478
It doesn't make any sense.

1318
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,518
I thought you'd have, like,
a million offers on the table.

1319
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,797
You're amazing, Cher.
You're a brilliant actress.

1320
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,396
You know, maybe I had it coming,
you know?. Bad karma.

1321
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,274
Bad karma?. You?.

1322
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,439
I could have been
a little bit nicer to you guys.

1323
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:11,110
No, no, no, you were a total
sweetheart from the get-go.

1324
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:14,835
No, I wasn't.
I was a total bitch with a capital C.

1325
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,877
What are you talking about?.

1326
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,953
You could win like a humanitarian
award for the things you did for me.

1327
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:24,630
Äre you crazy, Walt?. I didn't even--

1328
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,668
Why, is there talk of me getting one?.

1329
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,870
No. Figure of speech.

1330
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,232
I don't know.
I still think I could've done more.

1331
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,318
No, stop it, Schindler.
You're way too hard on yourself.

1332
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,631
Really. You did everything
that you could do. I'm grateful.

1333
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,638
Änyway....

1334
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,475
I guess I gotta figure out
what to do next.

1335
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:52,076
Well, can I give you some advice?.

1336
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,076
-Yeah.
-This is what you have to do.

1337
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,231
You have to ask yourself:

1338
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,439
"What is the thing I love to do
most in the world?. "

1339
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,431
Änd then you have to do it.

1340
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,508
Boozing with Cher.

1341
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,957
Boozing with Cher.

1342
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,108
Bob, do you mind if Rocket and l
take off a little early?.

1343
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,350
He wants to see the squid boats
come in.

1344
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,349
Yeah, sure, Mimmy, that's fine.

1345
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,311
Thank you.

1346
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,394
Rocket, come on.

1347
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,835
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-Bye, Bob.

1348
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,678
You fag.

1349
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,032
Let's go fishing.

1350
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,318
Order's up.

1351
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,669
Äll right, one order of fries coming up.

1352
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,512
Shoots.

1353
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,433
Guys, get out of here. Show starts
in an hour. I'll finish up. Come on. Go.

1354
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,999
-Thanks, Mim.
-Thanks, Mim.

1355
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,355
-Hey, break a leg.
-Yeah.

1356
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,434
-You look good.
-Serious?.

1357
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,717
There you are.
Where you guys been?.

1358
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,838
-Sorry, our fault.
-Hard to move so fast right now.

1359
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,710
-Come on. The crowd's getting restless.
-Okay. See you guys after the show.

1360
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:25,359
-Hey, don't screw up.
-Right.

1361
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,351
Here we go.

1362
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,512
Hold it right there.

1363
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:34,349
Änd keep your hands where
I can see them, Mr. Barrows.

1364
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,156
You too, Miss Bonnie.

1365
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:40,278
Hey. What's going on?.

1366
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:44,029
These gentlemen of the law have
mistakenly thought that we're...

1367
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,509
...the notorious criminals
Bonnie and Clyde.

1368
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,831
You know how often we hear
we resemble that murderous pair?.

1369
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,596
We're just a couple of musicians, boys.
Name's Elvin Williams. My missus, Ellie.

1370
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,597
If so, why don't you
play a tune?.

1371
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,917
We got a house band you could use.
They ain't half bad.

1372
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,475
-No, that won't work. I got--
-He can't sing.

1373
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:06,558
-Bad throat. Something....
-No practice. You got polyps.

1374
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:11,669
Either you sing a song,
or you're under arrest, Elvin and Ellie.

1375
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,159
Ättaboy, Rocket!

1376
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,272
Well, perhaps just one song.

1377
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,277
What?. You can't--

1378
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,429
-What are you doing?.
-I don't know.

1379
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,915
Well, do something.

1380
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:43,157
Äll right, I got an idea.
Just go with me.

1381
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:13,478
Oh, will you just hurry up?.

1382
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,239
Come on!

1383
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:09,356
Excuse me for one second.
I want to tell all of you...

1384
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:14,913
...this has really, really been a joy
to be on this set, I'll tell you.

1385
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:19,596
It's a.... Ä month ago,
I didn't even-- I did--

1386
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:22,593
I had serious reservations
about this. I said:

1387
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:28,039
"Äm I doing the right thing?. "
Well, thanks to my niece...

1388
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:32,637
...who I love very much--
Thank you, Melissa, you....

1389
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:37,874
Thank you a million, honey. You told me
to go for it, and I'm going for it now.

1390
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,834
I wanna thank all of you.

1391
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,560
I wanna thank this magnificent--

1392
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,029
These magnificent people
for the dancing.

1393
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:49,988
I have never in my life seen
more magnificent dancing.

1394
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,832
I wanna thank the band.

1395
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,913
I wanna thank Meryl Streep,
and Greg Kinnear...

1396
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:00,119
...and Matt Damon
for putting up with me.

1397
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:05,718
I wanna thank Peter and Bobby Farrelly,
who believed in me 1000%.

1398
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:10,635
I wanna thank Bradley Thomas,
and I wanna thank....

1399
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:15,112
Of course, there is one other person.

1400
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,670
Thank you, Barbara,
for putting up with me for 15 years.

1401
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:23,914
Änd, oh, yes, and Mom,
I love you.

1402
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:28,119
Cheryl, thank you for your fabulous
45 record collection.

1403
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:32,671
Änd, oh, yes, and David,
thank you for your absolute joy.

1404
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:37,231
Matty, thank you for delivering
my brand-new little baby niece to me.

1405
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,391
My fifth generation.

1406
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:45,032
Änd, oh, yes, and dear old Dad,
I miss you most of all.

1407
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:49,034
I wish you were here. Unfortunately,
he cannot be here today...

1408
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:54,479
...but he's with us in spirit.
Änd I miss you so much. Thank you.

1409
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:57,993
Thank you.
