00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:50,247
Behold, there were
earthquakes upon the earth,

3
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,253
and in time,
two great dragons came forth,

4
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,449
ready to fight
against one another.

5
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,392
And at their cry,
all nations were stirred up

6
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:06,158
to fight against
the Nation of the Just,

7
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:10,600
and the Nation of the Just
was prepared for death.

8
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,730
But the Nation of the Just
cried out to the Lord,

9
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,900
and as they were crying,

10
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,037
the little spring
grew into a great river,

11
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:24,378
and abounded
into many waters.

12
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:28,443
The sun rose up
and the humble were exalted,

13
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,023
and they defeated
the haughty.

14
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,685
And that was the
end of the dream.

15
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:38,321
How can a little spring
turn into a great river?

16
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,331
Have faith, my love.

17
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:45,302
The Lord, in his infinite mercy,
will reveal its meaning.

18
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:49,398
Until then, you must promise
neverto reveal to anyone

19
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,740
that you are a Jew
from the Tribe of Benjamin.

20
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,245
Never, Uncle?

21
00:01:54,347 --> 00:02:01,219
(Uncle)
As God lives, there will be
a time for you to remain silent

22
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,290
and a time for you to speak.

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,018
You shall no longer
be called Hadassah;

24
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,893
you shall be called Esther,

25
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,990
a proper Persian name
for a proper Persian girl.

26
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,500
But Uncle_

27
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,936
And you must never
again call me Uncle.

28
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,100
From now on,
you shall call me Teacher,

29
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,270
forthat is what l am.

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,814
Do you understand,
Esther?

31
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,406
Yes, Teacher.

32
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,043
You must be careful,

33
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,523
for God has given me
this dream for a reason.

34
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,889
Come to me, my love.

35
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,361
Sing to me, my sweet,
sing to me.

36
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,558
(Esther humming)

37
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,976
###

38
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:07,580
###

39
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:13,286
###

40
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,123
(royal guard)
All hail, King Xerxes!

41
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:22,726
###

42
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,633
(crowd)
Hail, King Xerxes!

43
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:39,643
###

44
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,519
###

45
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,287
(Teacher)
Esther, Esther,
come quickly!

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,952
Esther!

47
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,698
As royal
as the king himself.

48
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,737
l fear it fits me
not at all.

49
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,069
l am only a modest man.

50
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,075
Well, you're going
to the royal banquet,

51
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:08,876
and you must honor
the king and his queen.

52
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,973
Howl envy her.

53
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,177
You wish to be queen?

54
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,618
No, l wish to be married.

55
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,349
Esther, my love,

56
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,119
you will marry when
l find a suitable match.

57
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,625
Have l no say
in the matter?

58
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,220
The Lord God
requires of us obedience.

59
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,663
lt is he that made us,
not we who have made him.

60
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:35,533
The Lord will reveal
his will soon enough,

61
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,338
l promise.

62
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,581
###

63
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:49,989
###

64
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:57,052
(indiscernible chattering)

65
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:13,578
###

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,705
Asplendid Royal Banquet,

67
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,216
thoroughly cheapened by the
presence of thatJew, Mordecai.

68
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,550
Abit harsh,
don't you think, Lord Haman?

69
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,283
lt's not in my nature
to mince words.

70
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,693
Lord Haman.

71
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,662
Mordecai.

72
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,561
l was not expecting
to see you here.

73
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,065
Likewise.

74
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,567
l was lead to believe

75
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,467
that only the king's closest
advisors would be invited.

76
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,971
As was l,

77
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,475
but apparently the Majesty
decided to invite you as well.

78
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,603
The king is a most
benevolent man.

79
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:52,515
Yes, most benevolent,
l fear.

80
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,850
lf l had it in my power,
l'd crush you under my heel,

81
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,323
you and your
insidious people.

82
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:04,726
As my God lives,
that day will never come.

83
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,935
(royal guard)
All hail, King Xerxes!

84
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,976
Hail, King Xerxes!

85
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,568
(King Xerxes)
Nobles, advisors,
and all royal servants,

86
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,980
l extend to you
my warmest welcome.

87
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:29,020
(applauding)

88
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,556
l'm indeed pleased
to celebrate with you

89
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,184
the anniversary of my
ascension to the throne.

90
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:41,392
(applauding)

91
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:45,801
Queen Vashti, too,
extends her warmest welcome.

92
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,999
(applauding)

93
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,038
And where is
our Queen Vashti?

94
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,511
Does she not find our
celebration rich enough?

95
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,241
Perhaps she is unwell.

96
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,874
(King Xerxes)
Please avail yourselves
of the food and wine,

97
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,977
eat and drink without limit,

98
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,318
for it gives me
great pleasure

99
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,416
to share this
celebration with you.

100
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,427
Let the feasting begin!

101
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,588
All hail, King Xerxes!

102
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,892
Hail, King Xerxes!

103
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:32,475
###

104
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,713
Keep open your ears,

105
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,555
l wish to know exactly what my
nobles and advisors are saying.

106
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,890
By your word, Majesty.

107
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:54,169
###

108
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,911
Mordecai's not
slept well lately.

109
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,743
He speaks of rumors
and threats against the king.

110
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,013
These palace intrigues
are not our concern.

111
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,144
You should think
of pleasant things.

112
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,347
Like marriage?

113
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,017
(laughing)

114
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,688
Don't you agree that a woman
my age should be married by now?.

115
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,789
You ask a difficult question.

116
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,336
Awoman should marry as soon as
a suitable match can be found.

117
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,463
Suitable match? Suppose
there is no suitable match?

118
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,974
Well, none of them are
suitable matches, l should know.

119
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,476
But you married Jacob.

120
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,638
Aye, that l did.

121
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,682
Were the two of you
not in love?

122
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,182
lf it was love
Jacob was after,

123
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:44,313
he would have married his donkey
and probably been happier.

124
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,323
And what about you?

125
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,121
lf given the choice, l would
have married Jacob's donkey.

126
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,195
Judith!

127
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,527
ln truth,
Jacob was a good match.

128
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,534
He's a hard worker
when he works

129
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,833
and a good provider
when he provides.

130
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,965
Do you love him?

131
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,872
Between children,
and grandchildren,

132
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,468
and all the things a woman
has to take care of these days,

133
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,710
who has time
to think about love?

134
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,663
Queen Vashti is a mystery.

135
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:35,867
Ever since the royal wedding,
she is seen so rarely.

136
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:40,173
Pity, she's more
beautiful than any flower.

137
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,009
Yes, Azada,
but flowers fade.

138
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,175
(Azada)
She likewise is more
beautiful than any sunset.

139
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:51,018
But the sunset eventually
turns to darkness, does it not?

140
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,648
Then again,
His Majesty believes herto be

141
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,751
more beautiful
than any jewel.

142
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:00,628
Butjewels can be
lost or stolen.

143
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,461
Mordecai?

144
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,264
All that you say is true,

145
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,740
yet does not Vashti
remain our queen?

146
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,334
Then she should appear
before us and receive our honor.

147
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,815
As it is written, like a
gold ring in a pig's snout,

148
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:22,445
is a beautiful woman
without discretion?

149
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,753
Yes, come.

150
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:36,498
###

151
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,833
What think you
of our Queen Vashti?

152
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,338
The king has called her

153
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,964
the most beautiful
woman in the world.

154
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,838
Then why does
she not appear?

155
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,141
ls our queen suddenly
found unsuitable?

156
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,808
lf the king chose her,
then she is suitable.

157
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:56,877
Even kings have been known
to make mistakes.

158
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:04,853
###

159
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,422
Toast to the king!

160
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,338
What news?

161
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,609
Your Majesty's
nobles and advisors

162
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:30,485
are anxious
to see the queen.

163
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,399
(King Xerxes)
My good people,

164
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,194
as much as l have
endeavored to provide you

165
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,292
with the finest
in food and wine,

166
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,201
l regret that
l have withheld from you

167
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:52,938
the greatest of all blessings,
Queen Vashti.

168
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,811
l shall therefore
deny you no longer.

169
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:01,148
And not a moment
too soon.

170
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:05,587
(King Xerxes)
Sardar, l command that the
Queen Vashti join us here

171
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:09,525
in the royal hall
and dance for us.

172
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:14,793
lt will please me greatly to
have herjoin me by my side.

173
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,664
By your word, Majesty.

174
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,613
(knocking on door)

175
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,749
(female servant)
Permission to enter?

176
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,320
(knocking on door)

177
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,791
(female servant)
Permission to enter,
Royal One.

178
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,359
Granted.

179
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,833
My queen,
the women wish to know

180
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,032
whetheryou prefer diamonds
or pearls on your headdress.

181
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,043
Cannot my husband, the king,
afford both diamonds and pearls?

182
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,578
Yes, that is so,
Royal One.

183
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,078
Then l shall have both.

184
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,580
Yes, Royal One.

185
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,913
lt's the least that
foolish man can do for me.

186
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:17,329
Royal One, l caution you to
choose your words carefully.

187
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,728
And l caution you not
to be so presumptuous.

188
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,858
Yes, Royal One.

189
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,131
The king is a fool,
but he is also in love,

190
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,230
which means l shall
have the upper hand.

191
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,107
Did l not vowto be a queen
unlike any Persia has ever seen?

192
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:37,649
Yes, my queen, and you have
kept that vow most faithfully.

193
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,479
(knocking on door)

194
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,984
Who's there?

195
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,487
(Sardar)
Sardar, the commander of
His Majesty's royal army.

196
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,255
l honoryou, Queen Vashti.

197
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,423
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

198
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,831
The king has commanded
your presence at once.

199
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,699
You are to wear
yourfinest garments

200
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,204
and place ajeweled tiara
upon your head.

201
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,367
ln such fashion shall you
dance for His Majesty

202
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,535
and for his guests.

203
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,135
(laughing)

204
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,942
ls that what the king asks?

205
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,952
No, Royal One,
it is what the king commands.

206
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,113
Tell him l'm busy.

207
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:23,355
(Sardar)
Royal One,
l'm afraid you misunderstand.

208
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:28,593
The king has commanded you
to come before him and dance.

209
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,727
Suppose l'm not
in the mood for dancing?

210
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,328
(Sardar)
The king is also a warrior.

211
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,376
When he commands his soldiers,
they must obey.

212
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,468
Very well,

213
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,515
have him command his army
to dance for him.

214
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,084
Royal One!

215
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,696
lf l return to the king
without you,

216
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,961
my life may be in peril.

217
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,764
For the sake of my head,

218
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,432
l ask that you do
as the king commands.

219
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,704
l care not foryour head
norfor anyone else's.

220
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,210
l have made up my mind.

221
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,009
And even if His Majesty himself
came to fetch me,

222
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,175
l would not go.

223
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,845
Now leave me!

224
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,082
l find this
conversation tiresome.

225
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:46,338
###

226
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,404
(grunting toasts to the king)

227
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,314
###

228
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,790
The queen tarries.

229
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,794
Perhaps she needs more time
to make herself presentable.

230
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:08,356
Perhaps she is deliberately
trying to keep us in suspense.

231
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,901
We soon shall see.

232
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,873
Sardar, what is
the meaning of this?

233
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,410
Who dares disobey the king?

234
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,274
(Sardar)
The queen, Your Majesty.

235
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,870
(King Xerxes)
What did she say?

236
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,679
Out with it!

237
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,820
(Sardar)
She said she was not
in the mood for dancing.

238
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,654
(King Xerxes)
lf this is treason you speak
against the queen_

239
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,196
lt is not treason,
Your Majesty, but truth.

240
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,858
(King Xerxes)
Perhaps the queen
misunderstood my command.

241
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,696
No, Majesty.

242
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,963
The queen
understood perfectly.

243
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,470
She said that
even if Your Majesty

244
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,905
came to fetch her yourself,

245
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,977
she would not go.

246
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,383
(King Xerxes)
This impertinence
shall not stand.

247
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,112
lf l allow Queen Vashti
to disobey me,

248
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,020
then what will stop the women
of Persia from doing likewise?

249
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,150
l shall therefore
issue a new command.

250
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,921
(Sardar)
By your word, Majesty.

251
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,396
(King Xerxes)
l command that Queen Vashti

252
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,696
be removed from
the palace at once,

253
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:22,866
and l decree that
my marriage to her

254
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,411
is null and void.

255
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,412
(Sardar)
By your word, Majesty.

256
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,914
(royal guard)
All hail, King Xerxes!

257
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,984
Hail, King Xerxes!

258
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,653
l wish to be alone.

259
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,595
(Judith)
Esther, Esther,
l have terrible news!

260
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,100
What is it?

261
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,967
The king has dissolved
his marriage to Queen Vashti.

262
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,837
lt is said that she
wickedly disobeyed a command.

263
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,467
What exactly did the king
command herto do?

264
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,102
She was commanded

265
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,376
to dance forthe king
and his guests, and she refused.

266
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,348
And forthis reason
she was banished?

267
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,511
Well, a royal command is
not to be taken lightly,

268
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,714
nor should a woman
disobey her husband.

269
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,054
Oh Judith,
you're one to talk.

270
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,059
Would you have me believe
that there is no disobedience

271
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,560
in your marriage?

272
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,062
None whatsoever.

273
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,156
Jacob does exactly
what l tell him to do.

274
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,267
Perhaps it is best
that l'm not married.

275
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,499
lt is a
complicated business.

276
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,872
But not without
its rewards.

277
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,376
Judith,
stop your gossiping.

278
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,471
These palace intrigues
are none of our concern.

279
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,313
Oh, Miriam, Miriam!
l have terrible news!

280
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,179
This is a disaster
forthe kingdom.

281
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,386
Afatalist sees a disaster;
a wise man sees opportunity.

282
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,521
But Lord Haman,
Persia is without a queen!

283
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,861
Then His Majesty will simply
have to find a new one!

284
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,765
Yes, Lord Haman, but
from which part of the world?

285
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,237
All of our allies have
run out of eligible brides.

286
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,706
Well, then His Majesty
will have to find a new queen

287
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,674
amongst his own people,

288
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:11,079
a young woman of nobility,
preferably...

289
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:16,018
a daughter of one of
his closest advisors.

290
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,588
Ah!

291
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,191
What a pity it is that the gods
have favored you with ten sons

292
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,697
and not a single daughter.

293
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,198
But Gaspar,
have you forgotten

294
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,997
that l have daughter
called Zara?

295
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,404
Forgive me, Lord Haman,
but she is but a child.

296
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,975
That was yesterday.

297
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,839
You know children,
they grow up so quickly.

298
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,879
Quickly enough for marriage?

299
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,948
lndeed!

300
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,280
You must take this proposal
to the king at once.

301
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,288
(Lord Haman)
No, no, no, l'm far too modest
to make such a proposal myself.

302
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,258
No, no, that is why l'm relying
upon you to make it for me.

303
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,157
Me? But__

304
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:03,531
Oh, faithful friend, l want
the honorto be all yours.

305
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:07,696
(laughing)

306
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,634
But, Lord Haman,

307
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:17,204
what if His Majesty
receives it badly?

308
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,545
l may lose my head.

309
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,815
But l would be supremely
grateful foryour sacrifice.

310
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:29,952
Now, the king's counsel will
be meeting with the king soon.

311
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:35,364
l want you to prepare
well your speech,

312
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:41,269
for my sake,
as well as foryours.

313
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,809
Blessed are you, Lord,
our God, King of the universe,

314
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,715
who sanctifies us
with his commandments

315
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,813
and commands us to light
the Sabbath candles.

316
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,391
Amen.

317
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,521
We should also give thanks
for our King Xerxes,

318
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,725
for permitting our people to
celebrate the Sabbath in peace.

319
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,167
lf the king did not permit us
to celebrate the Sabbath,

320
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,432
we would of course disobey,
would we not?

321
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,837
Yes, my child,
that is true.

322
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:22,107
lt would be betterto disobey
the king thanto disobey God.

323
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,650
And yet the queen disobeyed
the king and was banished.

324
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:30,484
The queen was indeed banished
because of her disobedience.

325
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,716
The queen was banished
because she refused to dance

326
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,883
before the king
and make a spectacle of herself.

327
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:35,755
Esther!

328
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,398
l cannot find it
in myself to condemn her,

329
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,459
for if l had been commanded so,
l too would have disobeyed.

330
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,301
Esther, you are permitted
many things under my roof,

331
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,707
but treason
is not one of them.

332
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:57,111
lf the king commands it,
you are not to question.

333
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,876
Even if the king
commanded our people

334
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,383
not to obey the Sabbath?

335
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,884
(Mordecai)
Yes.

336
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,081
l mean no, l_

337
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,317
Either my words
are failing me,

338
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:11,362
orthe student has indeed
surpassed the teacher.

339
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:15,763
Esther, my love, you must
follow your conscience,

340
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,860
but obedience to God is the
sure path to righteousness.

341
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,370
Yes, Teacher.

342
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,964
Yes.

343
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:41,415
###

344
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,897
Yes, Lord Haman.

345
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,503
All hail, King Xerxes!

346
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,903
Hail, King Xerxes!

347
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,616
(Mordecai)
There must be
treachery afoot.

348
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,813
How so, Mordecai?

349
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,550
Haman's lips are moving.

350
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,889
(King Xerxes)
Providence has ordained
that my head bears the crown,

351
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,555
but is it also the
design of providence

352
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,031
that l should spend
my life in solitude?

353
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:28,232
ls there no suitable queen
for the king of Persia?

354
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:34,941
Your Majesty, if l may
have permission to speak?

355
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,785
Oh great king, it is neither
the design of providence

356
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:51,488
northe will of your people that
Your Majesty remain unmarried.

357
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,429
Where, then, would you
have me find a queen?

358
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,728
Do you think we've
not looked everywhere?

359
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,303
His Majesty has
looked everywhere

360
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:04,103
except from among
his own people.

361
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,475
This eunich
speaks truthfully.

362
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,010
ls it not customary
for the king

363
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,583
to marry the daughter
of one of his allies?

364
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:20,614
Customary, Majesty,
but not required.

365
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,928
(King Xerxes)
Again, the eunuch
speaks truthfully.

366
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,093
And Majesty,
if l may be so bold,

367
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,636
may l__

368
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:39,142
may l suggest you look toward
your nobles and advisors

369
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,212
for such a queen?

370
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,912
(King Xerxes)
Gentlemen, what
think you of this proposal?

371
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:55,755
Your Majesty,
ifl may be permitted,

372
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:01,823
Gaspar's suggestion,
while it is a worthy one,

373
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,094
is not feasible, l fear.

374
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,669
For what reason?

375
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,169
Your Majesty surely knows

376
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,435
that more than half of your
counselors are eunuchs.

377
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,203
That's a great disadvantage,
l'm afraid,

378
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:16,212
when it comes to
producing offspring.

379
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:24,622
Your Majesty, my worthy
colleague is mistaken.

380
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,716
One of your counselors
does indeed

381
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,557
have a suitable
candidate for marriage.

382
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,858
Pray tell me Gaspar.

383
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,490
Who is this
suitable candidate?

384
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:43,404
(Gaspar)
lt is none other than Zara,
the daughter of Lord Haman.

385
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:48,673
Lord Haman,
does Gaspar speak the truth?

386
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,118
He does indeed,
Your Majesty,

387
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,383
and while l love my daughter
more than my own life,

388
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:04,429
it would give me great pleasure
to offer herto you as a bride.

389
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,556
(Mordecai)
l also have another
candidate, Your Majesty.

390
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,602
(King Xerxes)
Mordecai, you have
never taken a wife.

391
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,331
Whence comes this candidate?

392
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,237
Your Majesty
speaks the truth,

393
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,971
however it has been my
pleasure to be the guardian

394
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,741
of a young orphan girl

395
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:28,478
who has grown into an
exceptional young woman,

396
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,023
as fine a daughter
as Persia can produce.

397
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:36,025
Tell me, Mordecai,
is she beautiful?

398
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,358
(Mordecai)
As lovely as a morning star,
Your Majesty,

399
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:44,527
and more importantly,
she is as obedient and modest

400
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:48,367
as she is beautiful.

401
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:52,170
(Lord Haman)
Permit me a word,
gracious Majesty.

402
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,404
As you wish,
Lord Haman.

403
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:59,540
The selection of a bride
is no small matter,

404
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,482
but l would think
you would agree with me

405
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:06,649
that only women of quality
should be selected.

406
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,056
(King Xerxes)
Did not Gaspar say that
my nobles and advisors

407
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,459
could select a woman
of good standing?

408
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,898
Why then do you disagree
with your own eunuch?

409
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:21,996
Very well then,
are there any others?

410
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,705
l have a candidate,
Your Majesty.

411
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,211
l also have a candidate,
Your Majesty.

412
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,808
As well do l, Majesty.

413
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:36,944
l command that the daughters of
Persia be brought to the palace

414
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,579
at the time of my choosing

415
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,285
and presented to me
for my royal perusal.

416
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:47,354
ln such manner
shall l find a new queen.

417
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,726
(royal guard)
All hail, King Xerxes!

418
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,736
Hail, King Xerxes!

419
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:04,942
###

420
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,881
This is a disaster
forthe kingdom.

421
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,682
Oh, a fatalist sees a disaster;
a wise man sees an opportunity.

422
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,223
Oh, silence,
you foolish eunuch.

423
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,224
Didn't l tell you to
prepare well your speech?

424
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,294
Lord Haman,
l had no idea Mordecai

425
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,386
would suggest a contest.

426
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,762
lt's insolence,
the nerve of that hapless Jew.

427
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,530
He proposes that a stray,

428
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,129
a cast-off become queen.

429
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,765
Mordecai said
she was an orphan.

430
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,367
We know not the child's
true circumstances,

431
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,039
nor are we likely
to find them out.

432
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:41,107
Lord Haman, if she
was raised by Mordecai,

433
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,245
she is clearly unsuitable.

434
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,119
What further proof
do you require?

435
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,490
Because Mordecai
is cunning, if nothing else.

436
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,190
Who knows what trickery
this old Jew has up his sleeve?

437
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,759
Lord Haman, l can confidently
predict that whatever candidates

438
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,637
may appear, they will be
no match foryour Zara.

439
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,404
What, are you a prophet
suddenly as well as a fool?

440
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:11,414
Rarely are those two qualities
captured in one man.

441
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:16,453
Shh, shh.

442
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,952
There we go, there we go.

443
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,358
Keep your head,
Lord Haman.

444
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:31,265
All will be well, shh.

445
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:36,773
All better be well,

446
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,436
because it will be
your head that is lost.

447
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:45,244
(laughing)

448
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,920
Haman!

449
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,590
(Esther humming)

450
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,959
(Esther humming)

451
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:04,795
(humming continues)

452
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,461
Esther, my love.

453
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,664
Oh, forgive me, Teacher.

454
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,469
l must remember not to make
noise while you are studying.

455
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:16,104
Esther, your singing is sweet
and it bothers me not.

456
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,274
My love, did l not
promise thatyou would marry

457
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,852
when l found
a suitable match?

458
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,818
Teacher, has the Lord
revealed his will to you?

459
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:24,479
Well_

460
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,263
All my worrying was for naught,
for l knowthat the Lord

461
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,961
has heard my prayers
and he has answered them.

462
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,439
Tell me, Teacher, tell me.
Who is it that l'm to marry?

463
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:47,773
lt is the king.

464
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,279
The king of what?

465
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:54,249
(Mordecai)
Why, the king of Persia
of course.

466
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,415
The same king
who banished the queen

467
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,456
because she refused
to dance?

468
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,491
Esther, my love, l know
this is a difficult thing.

469
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,858
Difficult?
Might l suggest impossible?

470
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,692
Why would the king
choose me as his queen?

471
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,197
He knows me not.

472
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,698
You speak the truth,
my love,

473
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,599
but it is also true the king
may not take you for a queen.

474
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,672
l thought you said
that a match had been made.

475
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,674
Not quite.

476
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,870
Am l to compete,
as in a race?

477
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,778
Esther, the competition
is fierce,

478
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:31,118
and if you lose it may mean
the death of our people.

479
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:35,650
This is beyond
my understanding.

480
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,026
(Mordecai)
My child, listen to me.

481
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,157
Lord Haman, the wicked
man who hates our people

482
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,635
has proposed his own
daughter as a match.

483
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,831
lf she becomes queen,

484
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,534
Haman will be the power
behind the throne.

485
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:57,980
Our king is still young
and requires sound advice.

486
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:04,180
l worry that Haman's evil
will be unrestricted.

487
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,280
You must pray, Esther.

488
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:11,829
You must ask God for
wisdom and strength.

489
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,490
l will need much
of both, l fear.

490
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,965
Fear not,
they are richly blessed

491
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,037
who put their
trust in God.

492
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:28,241
l will pray, Teacher, for
both wisdom and for strength.

493
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,678
Pray also for me.

494
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:36,743
l have lit a fire that
will not be easily put out.

495
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:43,488
Yes, Father Mordecai.

496
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,803
(male servant)
l honor you, Lord Haman.

497
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,303
Oh, honor me later.

498
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,464
Fetch me my wife
and be quick about it.

499
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,769
(male servant)
Begging your pardon,
Lord Haman.

500
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:03,313
Your wife left word that
she is too busy to see you.

501
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,553
Too busy?

502
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:17,720
lf my wife intends to follow
the example of the queen,

503
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,059
tell her she can
obtain the same results,

504
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,928
only l shall banish her
to the desert,

505
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,934
and when the vultures
have had theirfill,

506
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,368
she'll make
a pretty fossil.

507
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,703
Hush Husband, this foolish slave
has taken leave of his senses.

508
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,605
Nasir, return to your chores!

509
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,405
As you command,
Lady Haman.

510
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,272
Oh my husband,
what good news from the palace?

511
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,880
There is none.

512
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,711
Has the king rejected
our daughter as his queen?

513
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,216
He has not as yet.

514
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,344
Then why did you
insist the news is bad.

515
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,319
Because of that Jew,
Mordecai!

516
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,290
Thanks to his treachery,
the betrothal is now a contest

517
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,226
in which his own candidate is
a rival to our daughter, Zara.

518
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,490
The impertinence
of that man.

519
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,329
Now, we'll have to
depend on our daughter

520
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,632
to win the affections of the
king with her charm and beauty.

521
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,673
You realize, of course, that
puts us at a great disadvantage.

522
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,243
Oh, have l not eyes,
woman?

523
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,946
lf only the
king were blind,

524
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,076
then all ourtroubles
would soon be over.

525
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,246
Our daughter's
not entirely unfair,

526
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,789
and what of
Mordecai's candidate?

527
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,653
Have you seen her?

528
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,693
Then perhaps this
tension is for naught.

529
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,195
Oh, unlikely,
Mordecai's too clever.

530
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,094
(Lady Haman)
Perhaps you give him
too much credit.

531
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,862
All l know is that Zara
was not meant to have a rival.

532
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,766
There, there,
my husband.

533
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,032
Leave it to me.

534
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,601
With somejewels and
cosmetics and fine fabrics,

535
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:46,342
l shall fashion our Zara
into a worthy queen.

536
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,282
That'll take
an act of the gods.

537
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,614
ls your ambition lacking?

538
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,723
l shall see the
house of Haman rule,

539
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:59,126
then shall l have my revenge
on those insidious Jews

540
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:05,635
whose king
exterminated my people.

541
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:10,469
One task at a time,
my lord.

542
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,372
lncline your ear,
O Lord, and hear me,

543
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,884
for l am poor and needy.

544
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,920
You are my God.

545
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:29,459
Save your servant
who trusts in you.

546
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,327
Oh God, what you ask
is a difficult thing,

547
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:40,860
and yet l knowthat nothing
is impossible with you.

548
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:45,534
lf you will but call me by name,
l will answer and obey.

549
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,908
(God)
Hadassah, Hadassah.

550
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,379
Who's there?

551
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,575
(God)
Hadassah.

552
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,879
Who calls me by that name?

553
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,751
(God)
lt is l.

554
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,984
Lord?

555
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,499
Speak, Lord,
for l am listening.

556
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,097
(God)
Because l am with you,
you shall not be harmed,

557
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:23,408
for l am the Lord,
the Holy One oflsrael.

558
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,108
Yes, God.

559
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,675
(God)
There will come for you
a time to keep silent,

560
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,245
and a time for you to speak,

561
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:40,024
for in all things
shall l beglorified.

562
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:44,329
My God speaks
and l will obey.

563
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,009
Oh, house of Haman,

564
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:05,885
today shall you
receive your glory.

565
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,663
Where is my wife?

566
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,964
ls it success orfailure?

567
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,762
Patience, Husband.

568
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,996
The house of Haman did not
become great in 1 day.

569
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,198
(Lord Haman)
No, but it can be
ruined in 1 day

570
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,797
if my wife
and my daughterfail me.

571
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,308
We shall not fail.

572
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,877
Nasir.

573
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,514
Have a look.

574
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:43,958
###

575
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,962
lt's a failure.

576
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:53,135
Oh, why have the gods not
given me a worthy daughter?

577
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,636
She is worthy.

578
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,799
l didn't ask for a daughter
as handsome as myself.

579
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:02,607
lf she had but a fraction of
our beauty, all would be well.

580
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:06,672
Hush, Husband,
you upset the girl.

581
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,615
l will add a veil.

582
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,382
lt will add an air of mystery
for the king.

583
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,857
Nasir,
fetch me my fabrics.

584
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,889
lf His Majesty is enchanted
by a bolt of cloth,

585
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:23,933
then he's a greaterfool
than he's been given credit for.

586
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,333
Hush, Husband.

587
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,167
We shall not fail;
all will be well.

588
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,241
All better be well!

589
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,303
l tell you this day

590
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,903
that either my daughter Zara
will be crowned

591
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,414
the queen of Persia

592
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,977
or l will have
no daughter at all.

593
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:04,641
l may be poorly dressed,
but l am rich in faith.

594
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,371
My child, the palace will
provide you with all the oils

595
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,709
and perfumes
and cosmetics you require.

596
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,978
As much as she
desires and more.

597
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,780
l have everything l need.

598
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,116
(Mordecai)
lf she captures
the king's heart,

599
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,986
his eyes
will not disagree.

600
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,858
Forgive me, l have not
cried so since my wedding day.

601
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,157
Were they not
tears ofjoy?

602
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,731
Not precisely.

603
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,565
We go to the palace.

604
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,296
And may our God
go with you.

605
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,532
And be with your spirit,
Judith.

606
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:43,180
###

607
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:54,387
###

608
00:39:54,492 --> 00:40:09,396
###

609
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:24,411
###

610
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:39,426
###

611
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:54,441
###

612
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,316
(Gaspar)
Lord Haman's daughter,
the lady Zara,

613
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,917
is a woman
of great modesty, my king.

614
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,020
She wouldn't dream
of appearing before you

615
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,759
with herface uncovered.

616
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,427
An admirable quality,
l suppose.

617
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:23,206
###

618
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,974
Can it be?

619
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,550
Your Majesty?

620
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:32,385
You there, step forward.

621
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,627
By what name
are you called?

622
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,530
My name is Esther,
Your Majesty.

623
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,103
And who speaks for
this woman, Esther?

624
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,866
l do, Your Majesty.

625
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,407
And what say you
on her behalf?

626
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,977
(Mordecai)
l can only quote the
writings of my people,

627
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:59,015
that a virtuous wife
is more precious than rubies.

628
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:07,888
Your Majesty, my daughter Zara
comes from a noble house

629
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:11,223
whose lineage goes
back many generations.

630
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,159
She will make
a charming wife

631
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:17,360
as befits such a
fine and noble king.

632
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,904
lt is also written
that charm is deceptive,

633
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:26,102
but a woman who fears God
will be greatly praised.

634
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,269
(Lord Haman)
Majesty, these
superstitious ramblings

635
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,745
of this Jewish malcontent

636
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,373
should have no impact
on your decision.

637
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,817
(King Xerxes)
Lord Haman, has it not
always been my pleasure

638
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,684
to consider all advice?

639
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:43,089
lndeed, Majesty, indeed.

640
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,022
Sardar...

641
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,464
Escort these two great daughters
of Persia to my chamber.

642
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,695
l will summon them
at my pleasure.

643
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:56,034
By your word, Majesty.

644
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,626
All is prepared?

645
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,696
Would not Your Majesty
be better served

646
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:30,296
by speaking with
each woman directly?

647
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,931
l shall learn
more from this

648
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,909
than l could learn from
a thousand private talks,

649
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,106
forto my face they will
tell me what l wish to hear,

650
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:44,643
but in secret shall l divine
the true nature of these women.

651
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,985
Yes, my lord.

652
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:59,494
My lady, is this your
first time to the palace?

653
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,571
(Zara)
Yes, yours as well?

654
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,901
And what
thinkyou of it?

655
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,207
(Esther)
The palace?

656
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,272
lt's very...

657
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,851
palatial.

658
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,820
Yes, yes it is.

659
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:26,928
My lady, l suspect
you're a woman of great beauty.

660
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:31,024
Why then do you conceal
yourself with silk cloths?

661
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,366
Alas, l am not
a woman of great beauty.

662
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,439
This l cannot believe.

663
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,771
lt is my wicked parents
who have hidden my face.

664
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,902
They are hoping that the
king confuses my disguise

665
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:46,711
for modesty,
for if he sees my face,

666
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,375
he will be repulsed.

667
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:53,218
This cannot be.

668
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:57,783
May l be allowed to
determine this for myself?

669
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,693
You are beautiful!

670
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,806
You mock me.

671
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,638
l do not!

672
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,269
Surely, anyone with eyes
can see you are as lovely

673
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,043
as any daughter of Persia.

674
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,381
You are the first person
to pay me this compliment;

675
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,718
forgive me if
l am suspicious.

676
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:30,316
Can you not
see foryourself?

677
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:34,796
l only knowthat l'm a
disappointment to my family.

678
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:40,632
Your own parents do not know
what a treasure they possess?

679
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,137
lf l'm indeed a treasure,

680
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,867
it is one they are so
desperate to give away.

681
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,670
But surely it is
because they wish to have

682
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,369
a queen as a daughter.

683
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:52,176
lt is because my father
wishes to control the king.

684
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,342
l am only
a means to an end.

685
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:56,851
Forgive me for asking,

686
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:02,915
but suppose the king
does not choose you?

687
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,592
Then l shall pay dearly.

688
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:13,261
l shall be banished
and live on the streets.

689
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,737
No, if the king
does not choose you,

690
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,637
you shall not
live on the streets.

691
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,142
You will live
with me in the palace.

692
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,644
As your slave?

693
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,840
As my lady_in_waiting,
and if there be a more exalted

694
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:32,218
position, it shall be yours,
you have my word.

695
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:41,425
Summon Mordecai and Haman,

696
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,466
l have made my choice.

697
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,797
By your word, Majesty.

698
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:50,607
(King Xerxes)
My good men, what a pleasant
task l have completed this day.

699
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:56,068
(King Xerxes)
My good men, what a pleasant
task l have completed this day.

700
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,080
To select a wife from
Persia's finest daughters

701
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:03,085
has been most agreeable to me.

702
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:09,786
Though l have chosen quickly, l
am certain l have chosen wisely.

703
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:19,530
###

704
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,662
Without further ado,

705
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:27,676
it is Esther whom
l have chosen to be my queen.

706
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:35,375
But Your Majesty, a king that
judges quickly judges unwisely.

707
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:41,886
My eyes have seen
and my heart bares witness.

708
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,052
This is indeed my queen.

709
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:48,256
(Mordecai)
lt can only be
the work of our God.

710
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,065
l honoryou, my lady,
and l only ask that you commit

711
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:58,073
to your promise that l shall
be yourfaithful servant.

712
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,837
Consider it done.

713
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,220
l shall therefore
issue a royal proclamation.

714
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,026
By your word,
Great Majesty.

715
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:28,833
Let the word go forth
that Esther is my queen.

716
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:33,035
Prepare a feast
and declare a holiday!

717
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,611
Yes, King Xerxes.

718
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:50,888
###

719
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,562
l honoryou.

720
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,427
Even the gods themselves
are against me.

721
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,903
(Lady Haman)
And why is my husband
roaring about like a lion?

722
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,305
The house of Haman
lies in ruins because of you.

723
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,878
(Lady Haman)
Because of me?

724
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:14,042
lt would be an amazing trick
if l were able ponder it.

725
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,948
Your magic is worthless.

726
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,419
Hush, Husband.
Tell me about our daughter.

727
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,114
(Lord Haman)
We have no daughter.

728
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,214
This is strange news,
Husband.

729
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:25,361
l suspect the king
has chosen another.

730
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,794
What, you're mocking me
to my face?

731
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:33,837
Husband, in love as in war,
to the victor go the spoils.

732
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,428
Then l tell you,
this is war.

733
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,508
With the king?

734
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,477
With Mordecai.

735
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,980
Hear me, woman.

736
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:49,382
The house of Haman
shall be redeemed.

737
00:49:53,790 --> 00:50:08,805
###

738
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:22,742
###

739
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,621
Do not fear, Esther.

740
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:33,620
Thou may come closer.

741
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,036
Closer.

742
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,469
Are you indeed afraid?

743
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:53,948
(Esther)
No, great king, l'm in awe of
your majesty and of your wisdom.

744
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,709
How so?

745
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,219
You have chosen
me for a bride

746
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,789
without having spoken
a single word to me.

747
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:05,624
(King Xerxes)
Then come, sit at my
feet and let us talk.

748
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:10,462
As you wish,
Your Majesty.

749
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,169
Are you comfortable?

750
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,335
l must answer Your Majesty's
question with another question.

751
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:25,211
Ask.

752
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:31,083
ls this always to be my
position, at His Majesty's feet?

753
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,587
You are not
of noble birth,

754
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,988
and therefore you must
take an inferior position.

755
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,526
(Esther)
His Majesty speaks the truth,

756
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:41,222
but in marriage shall
we not be equally yoked?

757
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,060
My lady...

758
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:48,832
l cannot raise you above the
circumstances of your birth.

759
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,874
lf you are indeed
to be my husband,

760
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:56,002
thenthere is only one
solution to this problem.

761
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,182
This is the solution
you had in mind?

762
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,953
The very one, my king.

763
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,723
You are much more beautiful
from this perspective.

764
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,196
And His Majesty's face
is much more dignified

765
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,757
than His Majesty's feet.

766
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,873
Will you be an
obedient queen?

767
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,069
That is all l ask.

768
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,339
Will you be a
faithful husband?

769
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,846
That is all l ask.

770
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:37,250
My love foryou is as great
as my love for Persia.

771
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:41,188
And l shall obey you
as l would obey my God.

772
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:45,227
My queen exalts me.

773
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,888
lt was Mordecai
who taught me thus.

774
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,865
You have learned well.

775
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:55,563
l wish our
wedding was tonight.

776
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,503
Patience, my king.

777
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:59,472
We have only
just engaged.

778
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,808
ls not the king entitled
to get what he desires?

779
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:07,077
The king desires
virtue above all else,

780
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,381
and shall therefore be content
to wait for his bride.

781
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:16,357
l will wait, but it will
bring me no happiness.

782
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:17,858
Happier still will you be

783
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,896
when the day of our
marriage finally arrives.

784
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:26,492
lndeed, my love,
my Esther.

785
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:36,512
Nowyou must go, before
immodesty takes hold of me.

786
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:40,481
l fear no such thing,
foryou are a king.

787
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,745
But l am also a man.

788
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,319
Now go.

789
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:51,190
As my king commands,
l shall obey.

790
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,592
Good night, sweet king.

791
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:56,928
Good night, dear Esther.

792
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,946
Walk with me.

793
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,577
This night hurts time.

794
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:23,284
Yes, my lord, but it
is the dawn that heals.

795
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,054
The time has come
for us to act.

796
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,560
Agreed.

797
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:29,962
We've delayed long enough
while ourfoolish king

798
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,557
follows his heart
and not his head.

799
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:35,695
And Persia grows soft
as the consequence.

800
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,103
lndeed.

801
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,336
l tell you, Teres,
when l seize the crown,

802
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,038
Persia will again be great.

803
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:46,581
The army stands
behind you, my lord.

804
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,413
lt appears.

805
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,044
Their patience
shall be rewarded,

806
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,682
for soon they will dip
their spears in blood.

807
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,623
We strike at midnight.

808
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,160
l honoryou, my lord.

809
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,696
Prepare the men.

810
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,145
Lord Haman,
why trouble me at this hour?

811
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:29,886
(Lord Haman)
Gracious Majesty,
l have a thorn in my side.

812
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,554
Shall l help you remove it
along with your head?

813
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,530
(Lord Haman)
Gracious Majesty, have l
not been a loyal servant?

814
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:41,297
Yourfidelity is
unquestionable, Haman.

815
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:45,170
Since you have chosen Mordecai's
candidate as your queen,

816
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,506
it occurs to me that l'm less
esteemed as a result.

817
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:52,342
Your worthiness
is not diminished in my eyes.

818
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,815
(Lord Haman)
Yes, maybe not
in His Majesty's eyes,

819
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:58,854
but in the eyes
of my peers.

820
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,048
What would
you have me do?

821
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:05,457
Your Majesty, if it not
be too great a request,

822
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,360
it would please me well
if you could make me

823
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,491
the king's prime minister.

824
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,762
Prime minister?

825
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,168
lt is simply another
title, Lord Haman.

826
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,537
(Lord Haman)
Yes, but one that would
require your people

827
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,509
to bow before me.

828
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,603
Very well, Lord Haman.

829
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,148
(knocking)

830
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,649
ls there no peace
for the king?

831
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,150
Who calls?!

832
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,881
(Mordecai)
Mordecai, Your Majesty.

833
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:35,948
(King Xerxes)
Mordecai, my friend,
enter.

834
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,550
Athousand pardons for
the lateness of the hour,

835
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,128
Your Majesty.

836
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,255
Am l not still awake?

837
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:47,564
(Mordecai)
Your Majesty, l have a matter
of great importance to discuss.

838
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,538
Well then, keep us not
in suspense, Mordecai.

839
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,235
lt is a matter
that concerns the king.

840
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,743
l am now
the king's prime minister;

841
00:56:55,845 --> 00:57:00,077
what concerns the king
concerns me.

842
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,582
Merely anothertitle.

843
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:07,486
(Lord Haman)
Yes, but one that requires
thatyou bow before me, Jew.

844
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,582
There's not time,
Lord Haman.

845
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:15,357
Great Majesty, moments
ago did l hear Sardar,

846
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:18,559
the commander of your army;
and Teres, your bodyguard,

847
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,260
plot your assassination.

848
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,769
My assassination?

849
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:26,103
(Lord Haman)
Your Majesty,
this man has lost his senses.

850
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:30,509
He's accusing His Majesty's two
of his most faithful servants?

851
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,478
(Mordecai)
Your Majesty
must act at once.

852
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:36,109
The plot
commences at midnight.

853
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,709
(Lord Haman)
Your Majesty,
as your prime minister,

854
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:41,313
l advise you to send this
man back to his bedroom.

855
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,085
Obviously he has had
too much to drink.

856
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,661
Overruled!

857
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,925
We will investigate
these charges,

858
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:53,526
for Mordecai would have
no cause to deceive me.

859
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,763
Your Majesty.

860
00:57:55,872 --> 00:58:00,104
Send for Sardar and Teres,

861
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,544
we will find the truth
of this matter.

862
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:28,972
###

863
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,338
What troubles
my husband now?.

864
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:33,807
Have another of his
schemes come to naught?

865
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:37,607
Taunt me no further, woman,
or l shall banish you

866
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:40,182
as l have banished
my daughter.

867
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,183
Yes, Husband,
banish me to the palace

868
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,719
where l too shall
serve Queen Esther.

869
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:48,279
Oh, silence.

870
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:51,485
Am l not the
king's prime minister?

871
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,654
ls not everyone required
to bow before me?

872
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:59,030
Why does this revolting Jew
Mordecai refuse to pay me honor?

873
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,569
l suspect he has found
favor in the king's eyes.

874
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:05,004
This Mordecai shall not live
and neither shall his people.

875
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,600
Propose you then...murder?

876
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,112
l shall arrange
fortheir execution.

877
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,207
Afine, subtle distinction,
but a difficult task,

878
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,287
forthe Jewish people are
very loyal to their king.

879
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,413
Then what if they
were found to be disloyal?

880
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:24,357
An unlikely event.

881
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,758
l must get my hands on
as much of the Jewish writings

882
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,195
as l can find.

883
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,359
Does my husband
wish to turn Hebrew?.

884
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:36,234
Mordecai, he quotes his
people's writings selectively,

885
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,274
but not fully l suspect.

886
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,776
There's only one way
to discern this.

887
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:47,407
Will you read all
the writings, Husband?

888
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,542
l won't read any of them.

889
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,711
lt shall be done for me.

890
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,516
And suppose
no treason is found?

891
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,750
Then l shall create treason!

892
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:59,123
We shall gatherthe
great architects of Persia

893
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:04,530
and have them design gallows
fit for Mordecai, the Jew.

894
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,534
(laughing)

895
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:13,041
Finally, my wife comes up
with a sensible idea.

896
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:18,169
(knocking on door)

897
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:23,809
Teacher!

898
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:28,722
And my dear, sweet Judith.

899
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,692
My darling child,
l mean, my queen.

900
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,261
Oh!

901
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,430
And what think you
of the palace, Judith?

902
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:42,595
lt has so many rooms,
a person could get lost.

903
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,263
Yes.

904
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,433
Who is this
lovely young girl?

905
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:49,306
Oh, this is Zara,
Lord Haman's daughter.

906
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,811
l honoryou, Mordecai.

907
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:55,009
This beautiful woman
is Haman's daughter?

908
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:58,519
l confess to the truth of it,
but with no gladness of heart.

909
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,920
My lovely girl,
l fearforyour life.

910
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:05,051
Yourfather is a proud man,
easily angered.

911
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,628
l have no concern
for my life,

912
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,221
for Esther has promised
to take care of me.

913
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,271
(laughing)

914
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:22,237
(Mordecai)
My queen, l trust thatyou
have found marriage agreeable?

915
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,007
ln truth, Teacher,
l find it bittersweet.

916
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,513
How so?

917
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:30,677
My husband, the king,
l so rarely see him.

918
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:34,951
Surely the queen may see
the king at her pleasure?

919
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,616
Nay, Judith.

920
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,421
A woman is not to enter
the king's presence

921
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,053
unless she be summoned,
even the queen.

922
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:44,224
Aye, ifJacob
had such a law,

923
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,891
he would spend
even more time alone.

924
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,401
Judith.

925
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,438
And likely be
grateful forthe silence.

926
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,640
l would be put to death
were l too to disobey.

927
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:59,977
Lord Haman has lately kept
the king heavily engaged

928
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,210
with the affairs of state.

929
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,218
l doubt not the
king's love for me,

930
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:08,120
but l fear my rival is Persia
forthe king's affection.

931
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,987
Fear not, my queen.

932
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,323
lf the king loves you
as well as Persia,

933
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,953
then he loves you
well indeed.

934
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,363
As always, my Teacher
speaks the truth.

935
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:22,564
My queen,
you have learned well.

936
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:29,137
Come Judith,
l have much to showyou.

937
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,514
All hail,
King Xerxes of Persia.

938
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,716
Hail, King Xerxes!

939
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:46,420
Lord Haman, l should have
chosen you for a consort,

940
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:50,397
for l spend more time with you
than l spend with the queen.

941
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,095
Your Majesty, this is
a matter of extreme urgency.

942
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:57,036
Forthe sake of your
neck, Lord Haman,

943
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,541
l require that it be
a matter of life or death.

944
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:04,841
(Lord Haman)
Your Majesty,
this is a matter of treason.

945
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,313
Treason?

946
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,817
Am l surrounded by
nothing but conspirators?

947
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,478
lf my throne is in
peril, Lord Haman,

948
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:15,682
why then are we
completely unaware?

949
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:20,229
Because, Your Majesty, the
threat comes not from without.

950
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:25,289
The threat
comes from within.

951
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:31,362
And only nowyou
bring this to my attention?

952
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,066
Your Majesty,

953
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,906
there is a group of people in
your kingdom who are disloyal.

954
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,947
And who are
these disloyal people?

955
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:41,812
The Jews, Your Majesty.

956
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:42,976
The Jews?

957
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,552
They support another?

958
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,059
lmpossible!

959
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,187
The evidence
lies here before you.

960
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:59,826
Am l Jew, Lord Haman,
that l can read such things?

961
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:03,702
Then allow us
to translate.

962
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,513
''Sing praises to God.

963
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,947
''Sing praises to our King.

964
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:19,681
''For God is the King
of all the earth.

965
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,758
''lt is God
who reigneth overthe people.

966
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:27,353
lt is God
who sitteth upon the throne.''

967
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,421
lf this is not proof
of treason, Your Majesty,

968
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,468
then l cannot
produce any.

969
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:41,137
They repay my generosity
with insolence?

970
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:45,544
(Lord Haman)
Your Majesty,
if it pleases you,

971
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:50,517
l have chosen the 13th day of
the 12th month, Your Majesty.

972
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,885
Let on this day
every traitorous Jew,

973
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:58,017
young, old, women,
children, be annihilated.

974
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,927
Azada...

975
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:12,337
Let it be done
as Lord Haman commands.

976
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,470
(Azada)
By your word, Your Majesty.

977
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:24,042
###

978
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,652
(knocking on door)

979
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,154
Who calls?

980
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,655
(Zara)
The lady Zara,
Your Majesty.

981
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,225
Enter at once.

982
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,086
Avisitorto see
Your Majesty?

983
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,663
Enter.

984
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,339
l honoryou, my queen.

985
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:49,241
Judith, it's so
good to see you.

986
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,869
But the bad news l bring

987
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,643
will surely hurt
Your Majesty's heart.

988
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,082
l come at the
request of Mordecai.

989
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,552
Why does he
not come himself?

990
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,054
Because, my queen,

991
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:05,025
Mordecai sits at home
in sackcloth and ashes.

992
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,857
Judith, you must
tell me this news at once.

993
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,392
Shall l speak
freely, my queen?

994
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,470
Lady Zara
has my confidence.

995
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:20,267
lt is the wicked
Lord Haman, my queen.

996
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:23,174
He has convinced
your husband, the king,

997
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:28,512
to destroy all the Jews.

998
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:35,318
No, this cannot be.

999
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,949
On the 13th of this month,

1000
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:43,123
all theJews
will be put to death,

1001
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:46,133
including you.

1002
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:50,699
l've said too much.

1003
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:53,775
Zara, l beg you
to keep this a secret.

1004
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,503
My lady, l would
never betray you.

1005
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:59,012
My father is an evil man and
l beg you a thousand pardons.

1006
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,912
lt's no fault
of yours, Zara.

1007
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,145
There's no need
forforgiveness.

1008
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,684
What is Mordecai's advice?

1009
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:16,629
He asks that
you go to the king

1010
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:21,863
to beg him for mercy
and plead for our people.

1011
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,739
Judith, l cannot,

1012
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,241
for no woman is permitted
to enterthe king's presence

1013
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,471
without being summoned.

1014
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,241
Even the queen
must obey this law.

1015
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:36,318
Thenthis
is Mordecai's answer...

1016
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:45,092
There is a time
to remain silent

1017
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:48,755
and a time to speak,

1018
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,924
but if you
remain silent now,

1019
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:56,232
you and your people
will perish.

1020
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:01,503
ls it not possible that you have
come to your royal position

1021
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,545
for such a time as this?

1022
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:05,238
Judith, l_

1023
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:24,531
Go then, and tell Mordecai
to gather all the Jews of Persia

1024
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,193
and have them fast for me.

1025
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:31,069
They shall not eat or drink
for 3 days, day or night,

1026
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:35,576
and l shall do the same,

1027
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:40,172
and then l will
go to the king.

1028
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:45,948
And if l perish,
l shall perish.

1029
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:50,219
lt will be done
as you say, my queen.

1030
01:08:54,263 --> 01:09:09,167
###

1031
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:14,950
###

1032
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:24,188
###

1033
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:28,797
###

1034
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:33,757
l beg you, my queen,
do not make this mistake.

1035
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:36,201
The king is
a man of his word,

1036
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,741
and you will surely
be put to death.

1037
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:44,336
Azada, do not fear.

1038
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:49,416
Nowtake me at once
to the king.

1039
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:54,217
l honoryou,
Queen Esther.

1040
01:09:57,059 --> 01:10:09,199
###

1041
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,704
Tell me, Lord Haman,

1042
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:14,833
that this concludes
our business forthe day.

1043
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,469
lf Your Majesty commands it

1044
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,980
then we shall
continue at anothertime.

1045
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:23,916
l do command it.

1046
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:26,681
By your word,
Great Majesty.

1047
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,559
l honoryou,
King Xerxes.

1048
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,861
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

1049
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,460
Lord Haman.

1050
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:46,029
The queen is here to
see you, Your Majesty.

1051
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:49,702
Summoned you the queen,
great king?

1052
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,939
l did not.

1053
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,294
Esther, my queen.

1054
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:09,626
Forgive my transgression,
Your Majesty,

1055
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,724
for l knowthat
your word is the law.

1056
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,736
Forgive my
transgression, my love,

1057
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:18,136
for because of Lord Haman,

1058
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,730
l have placed
the affairs of the state

1059
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:23,505
above the affairs
of the heart.

1060
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:30,018
lf it pleases Your Majesty,
l would like to make a request.

1061
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,087
lt does indeed please me.

1062
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:34,587
My petition is this:

1063
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,180
Let Your Majesty
come tomorrow

1064
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,453
to a banquet
which l will prepare.

1065
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,723
You and Lord Haman.

1066
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,355
Then l will make
my request known.

1067
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,661
What say you, Lord Haman?

1068
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:50,500
Your Majesty...

1069
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:55,066
l wouldn't dream of declining
such a gracious invitation.

1070
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:57,711
Then let it be done.

1071
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,907
Thank you, my king.

1072
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:35,075
(laughing)

1073
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,778
Does my wife
adore her husband?

1074
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:41,287
Your persistence
exceeds your cruelty,

1075
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,382
a quality much
to be admired.

1076
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,256
Do we not have everything?

1077
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,761
Agreat name.

1078
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:49,330
Ah, and vast wealth.

1079
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,626
And revenge.

1080
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:53,634
And with the king
under my thumb,

1081
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:56,705
the house of Haman
rules.

1082
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:01,936
(laughing)

1083
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:06,174
Oh, l forgot to mention,
my dear, beautiful wife,

1084
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,079
that l am the only person
the queen has invited

1085
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,379
to the royal banquet
forthe king.

1086
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:13,079
Queen Esther?

1087
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,156
What a bizarre invitation.

1088
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:16,724
Surely she knows

1089
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:20,124
what will become of her
benefactor, Mordecai.

1090
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,459
Mention not that name.

1091
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,829
His demise
will be soon enough.

1092
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:30,337
lt is the queen who
arouses my suspicion.

1093
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:34,808
Harbor no such thoughts,
dear wife.

1094
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,812
lt is the king who
controls the queen,

1095
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:45,342
but it is l who
controls the king.

1096
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:50,414
(laughing)

1097
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:58,191
(laughing continues)

1098
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,932
ls my husband, the king,
well pleased?

1099
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:09,476
As well pleased
as l am well fed.

1100
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,136
And you, Lord Haman?

1101
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,907
The pleasure of this meal

1102
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:16,644
is matched only by the pleasure
of the queen's company.

1103
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:22,516
Queen Esther,
what is your petition?

1104
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,023
Ask and it shall be granted.

1105
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,424
Whatever you request,
even up to half my kingdom,

1106
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,621
l will give it to you.

1107
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,028
lf it pleases
Your Majesty,

1108
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:36,161
grant me my life and spare my
people, forthis is my request.

1109
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:42,567
(King Xerxes)
Esther, my love,
you make a strange petition.

1110
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:45,272
Who has threatened your life?

1111
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,907
Agreat enemy,
Your Majesty.

1112
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,985
Lord Haman.

1113
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:58,424
Lord Haman, would you
molest a queen in her own home?

1114
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:02,293
Your Majesty,
the queen is surely mistaken.

1115
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,491
l would never
lay a hand on her.

1116
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:08,968
Lord Haman speaks falsely,
Your Majesty,

1117
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:12,598
for he has ordered the
destruction of my people

1118
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:15,302
and me.

1119
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:20,438
lf he had merely made us slaves,
l would have remained silent,

1120
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:24,110
forthere would be no need
to disturb the king.

1121
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:29,816
Lord Haman, have you
an answerto this accusation?

1122
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:35,886
Your Majesty, l know not
of what this queen speaks of.

1123
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:38,466
Lord Haman knows full well,
Your Majesty,

1124
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:40,535
for did he not cause you
to orderthe destruction

1125
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:42,103
of the Jews?

1126
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,865
TheJews?

1127
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:47,169
They are a treacherous
people, my queen.

1128
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,801
Lord Haman has
shown me the evidence.

1129
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,345
Has he indeed?

1130
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,505
Your Majesty, may l ask,

1131
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:57,449
what has this matter
got to do with the other?

1132
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:01,421
Only that the Jews
are my people.

1133
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:05,254
lf they be found traitors,
let me be guilty as well.

1134
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,329
This cannot be.

1135
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,730
Your Majesty,
perhaps the queen is unwell.

1136
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,701
Please, l beg you
to have mercy on her.

1137
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:18,932
You would beg mercy for me
yet deny it to my people

1138
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,633
and Mordecai?

1139
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,074
ls he a traitor?

1140
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:28,877
Has it not been
recorded in history

1141
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:31,475
that Mordecai
once saved your life?

1142
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,021
Does a traitor
conspire against himself?

1143
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:35,612
Great Majesty_

1144
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:41,094
(King Xerxes)
Were not for Mordecai,
Esther would not be my queen.

1145
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:44,654
Yes, that is indeed true.

1146
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,326
l have made
a terrible mistake.

1147
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:50,098
(Lord Haman)
One that is easily
rectified, Your Majesty.

1148
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:54,232
You will simply have to
find yourself another queen.

1149
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,811
l have condemned
a man to death

1150
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,972
without first giving him the
opportunity to defend himself,

1151
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:03,347
he and his people.

1152
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,919
Azada!

1153
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:12,251
Send for Mordecai at once
and summon my counselors.

1154
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:17,355
l wish for everyone to hear
the testimony tomorrow at noon.

1155
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,094
By your word, King Xerxes.

1156
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:25,935
Then we shall
knowthe truth.

1157
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:54,429
All hail,
King Xerxes of Persia!

1158
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:57,300
Hail, King Xerxes!

1159
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:19,085
(King Xerxes)
Men of Persia, this day l have
summoned you to hear the case

1160
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:22,630
against the Jewish people.

1161
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,427
l was persuaded
of their guilt

1162
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:29,061
and sentenced them
to a violent death,

1163
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:33,198
all the Jews, all the Jews,

1164
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:37,005
including Mordecai

1165
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:39,444
and my queen.

1166
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,684
But as Lord Haman
once pronounced,

1167
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:48,779
the king whojudges quickly
judges not wisely.

1168
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:52,826
And in this event,
he is correct.

1169
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:57,797
Therefore l shall
ask Lord Haman again

1170
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,333
to present his case
against theJews.

1171
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:07,398
But this time, Mordecai will
be allowed to defend theJews.

1172
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,282
Lord Haman?

1173
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:21,378
(Lord Haman)
Your Majesty, as l believe
l have so eloquently proven,

1174
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,856
that the Jews are
a traitorous people,

1175
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:30,023
who honortheir God
and despise their king,

1176
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:32,965
and as their
writings also affirm,

1177
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:35,366
it is their God
who rules them,

1178
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,873
and it is their God
who sits upon the throne.

1179
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:47,339
Mordecai, have you
an answerto this charge?

1180
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:51,647
(Mordecai)
Your Majesty, Lord Haman
does indeed quote the writings

1181
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:56,952
of my people accurately,
but not completely,

1182
01:19:57,058 --> 01:20:02,223
for it also written
that God establishes kings.

1183
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:09,293
Therefore to disobey the king
would be to disobey God.

1184
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:14,832
(crowd murmuring)

1185
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,473
(King Xerxes)
Mordecai,
l must ask you in truth

1186
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:24,712
if you are and always have been
an obedient servant to me?

1187
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:29,553
(Mordecai)
Your Majesty knows well
the answer to that question,

1188
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,684
for l have served you
faithfully and obediently

1189
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:38,232
all these years, and
indeed yourfather before you.

1190
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,563
Of this, Mordecai,
l am certain.

1191
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,001
But l must also ask you,

1192
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:48,736
are you also an obedient
servant of your God?

1193
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,870
(Mordecai)
Your Majesty
also knows well

1194
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:55,143
that as a Jewfrom
the Tribe of Benjamin,

1195
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,617
l am an obedient
servant to my God.

1196
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,121
(Lord Haman)
That was quite elegant,
Mordecai,

1197
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,885
if not a bit deceptive.

1198
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:05,857
But answer me this,
Mordecai:

1199
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:07,792
What if there was
a contradiction?

1200
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:11,263
What if His Majesty
commanded one thing

1201
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:15,234
and your God
commanded another?

1202
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,465
Who then, Mordecai,
would you obey?

1203
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,273
Mordecai?

1204
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:26,609
For many years
l have lived in peace

1205
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:30,242
and prospered in the
service of Your Majesty.

1206
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,377
But before Your Majesty
came to be,

1207
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:35,388
my people worshipped
the God oflsrael,

1208
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:40,120
a living God who brought
my people out of Egypt

1209
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:43,686
and delivered them
from slavery.

1210
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:48,098
To Your Majesty
l owe my living,

1211
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:51,468
but to my God,
l owe my life.

1212
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,402
Traitor!

1213
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,909
Order, order!

1214
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:06,317
(King Xerxes)
Mordecai, perhaps you
did not understand my question.

1215
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,185
(Lord Haman)
These are words of treason,
Your Majesty,

1216
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,089
straight from the
traitor's own lips.

1217
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:16,730
(crowd shouting indistinctly)

1218
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,133
Order, order!

1219
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,965
(Esther)
Your Majesty, you have
permitted Mordecai to speak

1220
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,096
on behalf of his people.

1221
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,902
Permit me nowto speak
on behalf of Mordecai.

1222
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,777
As you wish, Esther.

1223
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:41,083
Your Majesty, have you not
always granted the Jewish people

1224
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:45,649
the freedom to worship
their God in peace?

1225
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,595
My love, it has indeed
been my pleasure,

1226
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:56,194
but it was also the will
of the late king, my father.

1227
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:59,171
Therefore l must ask you,
great king,

1228
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:02,675
when ever did you issue an
orderto my Teacher, Mordecai,

1229
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:05,940
which he did not obey?

1230
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:11,679
(King Xerxes)
ln truth, dear Esther,
l cannot recall such an event.

1231
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:15,654
Your Majesty cannot recall it
because it has not happened.

1232
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:21,662
(Lord Haman)
Your Majesty, this
Jewish queen pleads too late.

1233
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:28,225
She acts out of preservation for
her title as well as her life.

1234
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,796
Did not once
Mordecai save your life?

1235
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:37,139
And did you not reward him with
a royal robe and a royal horse?

1236
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:40,544
And was it not Lord Haman
who recommended it?

1237
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:44,846
(Lord Haman)
Your Majesty, the question
that was asked was

1238
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:50,516
what would be done forthe man
that the king wishes to honor?.

1239
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,492
l thought His Majesty
was referring to me.

1240
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,893
(crowd laughing)

1241
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,191
Therefore, Your Majesty,

1242
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:03,066
l pose to you the same
question Lord Haman asks:

1243
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:08,108
lf a king commands one thing
and God commands another,

1244
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:11,770
how would you have
this conflict resolved?

1245
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:31,097
l would have a man
follow his own conscience,

1246
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:38,396
for even kings have been
known to make mistakes.

1247
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:44,411
(crowd applauding)

1248
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:52,652
l find no treason
in Mordecai or his people

1249
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:57,714
and he shall continue to serve
me with honor and distinction.

1250
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:01,057
(crowd applauding)

1251
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:02,823
And his people shall live.

1252
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:08,465
(crowd applauding)

1253
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:14,535
Lord Haman, l am not yet
finished with you,

1254
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:20,376
for we must still address
the issue of your treason.

1255
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:23,841
My treason?

1256
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:26,614
Forthe havoc
you have created

1257
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:29,121
and forthe terrible
advice you have rendered

1258
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:30,851
as prime minister,

1259
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,520
l hereby
sentence you to death.

1260
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:43,296
And l command that a gallows
be built as quickly as possible

1261
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:45,872
with which to execute you.

1262
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,637
(Gaspar)
Gracious Majesty,
in his infinite wisdom,

1263
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,907
Haman has already
prepared such a gallows.

1264
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:56,973
Though it was
tailored for Mordecai,

1265
01:25:57,085 --> 01:26:03,115
l am sure you will find it
for him a perfect fit.

1266
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,326
(crowd applauding)

1267
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:14,460
l am repaid
with my own coin.

1268
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,196
To the gallows at once.

1269
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:18,938
Azada.

1270
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,769
l honoryou, King Xerxes.

1271
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:24,311
Remove at once
Haman's royal robe

1272
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:26,539
and place it upon Mordecai,

1273
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:31,779
for it is Mordecai who
will now be my prime minister.

1274
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:38,121
(crowd applauding)

1275
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:44,989
These events shall be
recorded in history.

1276
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:47,795
By your word, Your Majesty.

1277
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:50,336
And henceforth forever

1278
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:55,466
this will be, forthe Jews,
a time ofjoy and happiness,

1279
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:59,775
and let it be written
that it is Queen Esther

1280
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,282
who has saved her people
from the villain Haman.

1281
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:06,150
(crowd cheering)

1282
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:07,721
Queen Esther!

1283
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:12,115
(King Xerxes)
Azada, take this man away.

1284
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,390
lt shall be done
as you say.

1285
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:22,332
(King Xerxes)
Mordecai, now that you are
second in rank to the king,

1286
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:28,239
command a banquet to be held
with much food and wine.

1287
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:31,071
Your Majesty.

1288
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:34,080
For l would command it myself,

1289
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:37,549
but l wish to be alone
with my queen.

1290
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:42,885
(crowd cheering)

1291
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:45,926
Hail, King Xerxes!
