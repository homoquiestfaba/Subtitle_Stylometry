                 Yeah, mm-hmm.

5

             No, I'm absolutely
             100% guilty.

     It's my wedding night.

17
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:03,825
     Oh, no,
     I didn't kill my wife.

18
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:06,394
    What happened
    really wasn't her fault,

19
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:08,463
        and it certainly
        wasn't my fault.

20
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:10,965
   If the Justice Department
   had just done its job,

21
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:13,701
      I wouldn't have had
      to do it for them.

22
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:16,337
    No, I mean, look at me,
    I mean...

23
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,673
   I'm not the criminal type.

24
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:20,742
          Far from it.

25
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,746

    I'm a very law-abiding,

        <i>Well, more than</i>

62
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,882
       <i>It's my profession.</i>

63
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:14,589
         Is it just me,

64
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:17,091
   or do many of you also
   feel the world is becoming

65
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:19,026
        a more and more
        hostile place?

66
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,528
    It's no surprise, right?

67
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:22,329
       Because every day,
       all around us,

68
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:25,266
     we see examples
     of unethical behavior,

69
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,135
     abuses of power,
     outrageous injustices,

70
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:31,238
   heartless acts of cruelty
   that attack our conscience

71
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:34,375
     and, well, repulse
     our sense of fairness.

72
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:37,478
     So, we can recognize
     when behavior is bad,

73
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:40,114
     but how do we know
     when we're being good?

74
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:42,583
             Respect for the law
             is essential.

75
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:46,354
What laws? Apartheid laws?
Abortion laws? "He" laws?

76
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:48,089
   And laws are subject
   to change,

77
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,291
   but what is moral has been
   and always will be.

78
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,060
   Morality is forever.

79
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:53,694
               Even on weekends?

80
00:04:53,763 --> 00:04:55,964
         <i>(laughter)</i>
 The golden rule really works,

81
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:58,700
but only if everybody
in the world abides by it.

82
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,434
       <i>(Jack)</i> Impossible.

83
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,037
Hey, if you're not part
of the solution, you're
part of the problem.

84
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:06,507
   That's a good point.
   OK, a guy named Plenides,

85
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,976
  an obscure Greek statesman--

86
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:11,112
       Don't even bother
       to look him up.

87
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,082
      He's only available
      on parchment.

88
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:18,519
   Plenides was the first man
   to question the practice
   of pedophilia.

89
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:20,688
     Now, today, of course,
     child molestation

90
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:24,058
    is considered a heinous
    and unspeakable crime,

91
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:26,994
      but back in 400 BC,
      it was legal,

92
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:29,296
        it was the will
        of the people,

93
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,565
    and it didn't even break
    a commandment.

94
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,401
 There's "Thou shalt not covet
 thy neighbor's wife."

95
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:37,071
   It doesn't say anything
   about thy neighbor's kids.

96
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,207
       Well, one day,
       Plenides stood up

97
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:42,844
        and he raised
        the moral issue

98
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,146
     of whether
     it was right or wrong.

99
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:48,582
     Plenides said,
     "To live a moral life,

100
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:51,552
       "you must do more
       than required

101
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,988
    and less than allowed."

102
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:56,090
      What happened to Plenides?

103
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:58,092
  He was wrestled to the floor

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,427
  and stabbed by every member
  of the Senate.

105
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:03,865
 <i>(laughter)</i>

00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:56,770
        Of course, I didn't know
        I was staring right into
        the face of evil.

279
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:59,773
I know the area--
single-family homes,
good schools.

280
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,708
        But he's a model citizen
        all these years.

281
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,744
           He's mended his ways.
           I say leave him be.

282
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,447
I agree. I mean,
let bygones be bygones.

283
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,783
  That's easy for you to say
  if they're not your bygones.

284
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,752
  But what gives you the right
  to forgive injustices that
  happened to someone else?

285
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,754
        Only the victims
        have that right,

286
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:16,089
    and they sentenced Luger
    to death 50 years ago.

287
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,425
   Hmm.
              Interesting take.

288
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:19,993
Are you thinking
of moving?

289
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:21,995
           Wh-Why? I don't know.

290
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:24,498
I'm Joel Wayne
with Century 21.

291
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:26,200
I'd love to list you.

292
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,868
                    I see.

293
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,270
Why are you leaving
so soon?

294
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:33,073
    I got to go home and change.
    I take someone shopping
    on Sundays.

295
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:36,009
More volunteer work?
You're turning into
Brother Teresa.

296
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:39,012
           Hey, congratulations.
    Ahh.

297
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,882
    You're a gifted tax attorney
    and you deserve your name
    on the door.

298
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,819
Yeah, it's down by the doorknob,
but who knows for how long, huh?

299
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:46,821
         You're getting
         what you always wanted,

300
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:48,856
                even as a kid--
                money and power.

301
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,425
A lot of people have
money and power now.

302
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,160
I want what
the big boys have.

303
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,428
              Yeah, what's that?

304
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:58,232
I want to be feared.

305
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,934

       in the courtroom for Max,

320
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:05,966
           and now you're asking
           what you can do.

321
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:09,369
         All right, give as much
         as you can afford

322
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:10,471
         for Max's defense fund.

323
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,906
            It's tax deductible.

324
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:15,742
         Write your congressman,
         call the media--

325
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,545
              let them know that

          Jack, a neighbor.

   Please forgive my directness,
   but you are unfamiliar to me.

      I thought you might be
      with the FBI or the press.

00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:24,104
They crawl over us like bugs
and make our lives

366
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,273
         I know.
         The FBI interviewed me.

         what did you tell them?

nothing.

       Thank you. We are
       very pleased that so many
       of you showed up today.

370
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:36,050
They say that Mr. Brownell
is one of the top immigration
lawyers in the country.

371
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:37,952
Have you heard of him?

372
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,520
           I think so.
           He may have handled
           the John Lennon case.

373
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:42,189
 The Beatle?
                Mm-hmm.

374
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:44,792
Anyway, he feels
we have a strong case,

375
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,595
that after so many years,
evidence is lost,

376
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:50,464
witnesses die,
or their memories
can be faulted.

377
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,166

                he is a friend.

388
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:15,422
        No, Schatzi, no.

389
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:18,058

390
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,660
       Don't do that.
       No, Schatzi, stop.

394
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,004
          OK. You don't know me
          so well as the others,

395

My father made it himself.
       No, I've got to get home.

399
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,719
Do you have family waiting?
         No, I've got to grade
         some papers for school.

400
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:47,387
  A teacher?
                 Mm-hmm.

00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:50,724
Well then, in that case,
you are excused.

404
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:58,699
          Max is the real victim
          in this case.

        Max never misses
        a Patriots game.

406
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:04,638
In the first place,
there are no war criminals
'cause there was no Holocaust.

407

Everyone knows
it never happened.

408
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,775
      Have you read this?
Read what?

409
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,677
      There are new facts

410
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:11,845
                 Excuse me.
                 I couldn't help
                 overhearing,

411
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:14,181
            but did you just say
            the Holocaust never
            happened?

412
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,183
   It was a hoax perpetrated
   by Zionists.

413
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,185
        The real truth
        is all in here.

414
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,020
                Let me ask you
                this question--

415
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,521
                did World War II
                happen?

416
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,523
Of course it did.
What are you
talking about?

417
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,525
              How do you know?
              You weren't there.

418
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,527
             How do you actually
             know it took place?

419
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,997
My father served in it.
He told me.

420
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:33,266
    OK, so we have an eyewitness
    who lived through the war.

421
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:35,268
            You've probably seen
            old film footage

422
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:37,671
           of Germans shooting
           at American soldiers?

423
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:40,974
     And maybe old
     TV documentaries of Hitler?

424
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:44,344
      It's the same with
      the Holocaust. There are
      thousands of eyewitnesses.

425
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:48,415
    Guys, American soldiers
    like your dad, who liberated
    the camps, for God's sake.

426
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,751
     That fact of the matter is
     that both events took place

427
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,485
              in the same time
              at the same place,

428
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,054
              so why believe one
              and not the other?

429
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,388
        Whose side are you on?

430
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:57,224
                There's no sides
                in this issue.

431
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,359
There are to me, buddy,
and you're not on it!

432
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:02,429
          Did you just touch me?

433
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:04,131
Yeah, I'll touch you again!
        That's right!

434
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,133
           Who are you touchin'?
I'm touchin' you!

435
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:08,235
              You don't deserve
              to be an American!

Car accident?

451
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:03,991
                  No, a fight.

452
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:07,427
Hmm. From the looks
of that hand, I'd hate
to see the other guy.

453
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:08,929
                       Yeah.

454
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:11,431
             But then I started
             to think, you know,

455
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:14,467
    what would've happened to me
    in Germany under the Nazis?

456
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:16,837
An intellectual, an academic.

457
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:19,405
All you had to be
was Jewish, Catholic,

458
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:22,009
gay, Communist, handicapped,
Gypsy or "other"

459
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:24,011
and you're
automatically exterminated.

460
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,647
       And you say
       nothing's going to happen
       to this terrible man?

461
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:28,749
Well, Luger's already
in his 70s.

462
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:31,685
Case'll be tied up
in courts for years.

463
00:22:31,753 --> 00:22:34,287
He'll probably live out
the rest of his life

464
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:36,456
next door to me.

465
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:39,626
           Let it go, Jack.
           Keep your hand still.

466
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:41,695
      You fought the good fight,
      literally.

467
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:44,097

           Keep your hand still.

 <i>(breathing slows) </i>
                OK, you're OK.

471
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,077
     If this ever happens again,

472
00:22:57,145 --> 00:23:00,380
           blow into a paper bag
           and breathe back
           your own oxygen.

473
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,049
Jesus, what was that?

474
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,051
          Just your body telling
          your mind

475
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:05,886
          to change the subject.

476
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:09,556
           Keep your hand still.

477
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:15,028
Well, nothing's broken,

478
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:17,331
but the ribs
are badly bruised,

479
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:19,600

for a while, I'm sorry,

491

498
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:16,156
Unh-unh, just me.
I live alone.

499
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:18,058
        OK, well, then,
        what I need you to do is

500
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,560
    soak this hand in warm water
    and epsom salt

00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,963
           2 to 3 times a day
           for about 15 minutes,

502
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:25,832
    and then at the end
    of the night, pack it in ice
    for about 20 minutes.

503
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,334
     OK.

00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:29,369
                It's important.

551
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:04,624
And so you figure
that an hour is sufficient

552
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:06,726
to cover one of history's
greatest injustices

553
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,761

to this day as we speak?

00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:15,235
             <i>In fact, this hour,</i>

So now you're comparing
the engineered extermination

559

to aberrant sexuality?

572
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,682
and calm her down
and I said, "I like your hair."

573
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:06,186
And she has a Southern accent,
and she says, "My hair makes me
closer to Jesus."

574
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:09,455
It looked like she'd gone
to an ice cream store
to get her hair done.

575

Three scoops.
So anyway, I bring her...

           Is that it?

586
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,785
             Sometimes
             I have a habit of--

587
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,988
       You know, I like somebody
       and I show it.

588

No, it's got nothing
to do with you, believe me.

It really doesn't.

590
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:50,096
    I don't know, Jack.
    Sometimes it's hard for me
    to tell what you're feeling.

591
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:52,165
       Not tonight--that was
       just one of those things.

592
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:56,302
   But other times,
   when we've been out together,
   it's like you're not there.

593
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,004
    I know,

594
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,273
but there's a really
good reason for that,

595
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:03,843
and that is because
I feel so comfortable
when I'm with you

596
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,980
that I feel
I don't have to be there.

597
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:09,515
              It's a good thing?

598
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,651
Yeah, it's the freedom
to be alone

599
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:13,153
without being lonely.

600
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,854
             Oh, yes, like being
             with a friend.

601
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:17,490
   You're driving cross-country,
   neither of you saying a word,

      Yes.

     No.

My feelings are
far more than friendly

00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:45,852
        anger at an unfair world

615
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,422
            which is indifferent
            to your just demands
            and expectations.

616
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:52,491
 Over a lifetime, to survive
 these constant disappointments,

617
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,527
            people make a deal
            with their feelings,

618
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:57,563
          as if reason
          could deny them a way.

619
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:00,533
      But the rage,
      the rage lives inside you,

620
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,235
       screaming for expression.

621
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:05,104
      Unresolved with no outlet,
      it attacks within,

622
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,607
          first as self-loathing
          at your helplessness

623
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:09,509
             and ineffectuality,

624
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,345
  leading to a sense of weakness
  that leaves you limp,

625
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:14,780
         and eventually you sink
         into a state of despair

626
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,483
               and hopelessness.

627
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,918
        And as your will
        and your spirit weakens,

628
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,387
              so does your body.

Well, now, listen,
in the meantime,
I need something.

637
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:41,807
I can't sleep and I'm shaky,
and sometimes I feel like
I'm losing control.

638
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:43,476
     That's good.
     You're in too much control.

639
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:46,213
          You live in your head,
          you intellectualize
          everything.

640
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,448
    You need to deal
    with things more viscerally.

641
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:51,117
        I want you
        to act out your feelings
        so we can examine them.

            and change that.

644
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,457
            But first, let's
            find you an opening.

  <i>How is this possible, Morton?</i>

692
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:36,516
 <i>Just luck, I guess, John.</i>
              <i>Oh, shut up! Luck!</i>

693
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:39,953
 <i>Technically, it's because</i>
 <i>Ecuador has no extradition</i>
 <i>treaty with Latvia.</i>

694
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,187
      <i>And if the US avoids</i>

696
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:46,759
      Mueller? His name's Luger!
    <i>The man's name is Luger.</i>

697
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:48,461
   <i>The issue here is justice.</i>
                          <i>Right.</i>

698
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,130

 <i>(McLaughlin) OK, exit question.</i>

 <i>(Morton) Zilch, zero.</i>

00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:07,179
   <i>The answer is a minus one.</i>

705
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:17,022
    See what the boys
   in the back room will have

706
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,493
     And tell them
    that I'll have the same

707
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:25,130
   Just see what the boys
  in the back room will have

708
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,369
      And tell--give them
     the poison they name

709
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:34,106
       And when I die,
      don't waste my money

    <i>of the crime,</i>

730
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:39,138

732
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:46,746
      <i>So the obvious weapon</i>
      <i>had to be cyanide.</i>

733

    <i>See, it was quick, clean,</i>

00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:52,384

 Hey, Jack.

for the poison to work?

739
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:05,497
           Eight, ten seconds,
           depending on the size
           of the rat.

740
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:08,100
The rat?
A little smaller than me.

    Don't ever, ever tell anyone

      I could be in big trouble.

a word of this to anyone.

Mrs. Mueller--
Mueller, right?

00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:54,947
May I help you?
                        Inga.

758
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:58,251
          And please forgive me

          without permission,

759
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:00,486
        but did you know
        your door was wide open?

760
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,822
Yeah, I was in a hurry
before and I forgot
to close it.

761
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,957
            You bowl also.
Just a beginner.

762
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:06,358
             May I?
 Sure.

763
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:08,828
     It is very heavy. Ohh!
               Yeah, it's heavy.

764
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,830
But you know your arm.

765
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:14,033
I need a lighter one, of course.
I am just a woman.

766
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:17,770
                       So...
So your house--
just as I expected.

767
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:20,039
Oh, what a lovely hobby.

768
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:23,209
Oh, African trinkets,
Italian movies,

769
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:25,577
American jazz--
an international man.

770
00:37:25,645 --> 00:37:28,047
    <i>Needless to say,</i>
    <i>I didn't want this woman</i>

772
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:32,251
    <i>What was she doing here?</i>
    <i>What did she want?</i>

773
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:35,021
  And look at these books.
  Books, rows and rows of books.

774
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:38,290
               Books everywhere.
               I have difficulty
               reading myself.

775
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:41,594
    I have a wandering eye,
    but it is hardly noticeable.

776
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:43,963
                    Look.
Well, I-I-I wouldn't--

777
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:45,531
            No, no,
            look straight at me,

778
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,967
                now quickly look
                to the left.

779
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:51,570
Oh, well...
               I never noticed
               your eyes before.

780
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:54,007
        You were wearing glasses
        last time we met.

781
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:56,742
Yes, I generally wear glasses.
Sometimes I wear contacts,

782
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,244
but I don't really
like contacts.

783
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:01,280
               A shame. You have
               compelling eyes.

784
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:04,017
Thanks a lot.
Was there something you...?

785
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:06,619
        As you know, my father
        is being forced to leave
        the country.

786
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:09,022
Yes. That hasn't changed,
has it?

787
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:10,623
               No, he is leaving
               next week.

788
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,791
That's what I thought.

789
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,893
    And we are throwing a little
    goodbye party for him

790
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,160
          at his house on Sunday

791
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:17,396
        for all the friends,
        neighbors and supporters

792
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,498
                  like yourself.
                  Are you free?

793
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:21,000
Sunday day
or Sunday night?

794
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,402
            In the evening only,
            starting at seven.

795
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,371
Seven till when,
do you think?

796
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:28,908
         Not past 11. After all,
         it is a school night,
         professor.

797
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,409
    Yeah.

798
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,745
Well, I'm glad
you stopped by.

799
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:35,514
It was very thoughtful of you
to think of me,

800
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,016
        and thank you
        for inviting me.

801
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:39,151
    I think it's something
    I'd probably like to do.

802
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,686
           So then,
           I will see you there?

803
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:44,357
Ah, no, I have
a family function
of my own that night.

804
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:46,692
              Oh.

805
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:50,763
            Family.

806
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,598
          I like that.

807
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:56,035
            Sunday.

808
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:04,910
    <i>The night of the murder,</i>
    <i>I was double-booked.</i>

809
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:07,546
 <i>First I had to take Gail</i>
 <i>to a birthday dinner for Marty.</i>

810
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:09,348
     <i>Everybody seemed to be</i>
     <i>having a good time,</i>

811
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,150
        <i>so I don't think</i>
        <i>anyone noticed</i>

812
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,952
     <i>that I had other things</i>
     <i>on my mind.</i>

813
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,620
     <i>I tried to act normal,</i>

814
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,090
  <i>because it was very important</i>
  <i>that nothing I did</i>

815
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,459
    <i>seemed out of</i>
    <i>the ordinary that night.</i>

       <i>(car horn blaring) </i>

817
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:33,339
Well, that was a rush.

818
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:34,841
               I'm sorry, honey.

819
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:36,843

820
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,811
Tonight?
It's already 10:00.

821
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:41,247
     I know, but I'm preparing
     a new lecture for tomorrow.

822
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:43,382
           I thought I'd see
           a film on the subject

823
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,417
             and stay at a motel
             on route 10,

824
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:48,221
         kind of save myself
         the commute, work on it

1107
00:57:56,809 --> 00:57:57,909
             She'll be here.

1108
00:57:57,977 --> 00:58:00,178
You wanna order
some appetizer?

1109
00:58:00,245 --> 00:58:03,147
       I don't think we're gonna
       get to eat, thank you.

1110
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:05,383
Oh, to drink only
you must sit at the bar.

1111
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:08,019
           OK, I promise
           I'll order something.

1112
00:58:09,856 --> 00:58:11,289
                 Here she is.

1113
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,958
                 Just, please,
                 leave the water

1114
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:14,960
             and leave us alone,
             will you?

1115
00:58:15,027 --> 00:58:16,227
           Hi, honey.

1116
00:58:16,295 --> 00:58:18,363
        Sorry I'm late.
                        Gail--

1117
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,265
Jack, this table,
all by ourselves,
very romantic.

1118
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,368
                       Gail--
Oh, what a day.

1119
00:58:23,435 --> 00:58:25,971
I told my mother.
She's thrilled
and horrified.

1120
00:58:26,038 --> 00:58:28,473
"You're gonna marry a man
you've known such a short time?"

1121
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:30,509
I said, "Mom, you knew
Dad, what, five days

1122
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:33,144
when you got married?
It lasted 37 years.

1123
00:58:33,212 --> 00:58:34,813
37 miserable years,
but anyway--

1124
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:37,148
                    Gail!
   What?

1125
00:58:38,383 --> 00:58:40,351
                 I can't come
                 to our wedding.

1126
00:58:44,523 --> 00:58:47,392
        I have to be
        someplace else that day.

1127
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,427
And where would that be?

1128
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:51,162
                 A funeral.

1129
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,865
Oh, Jack, I'm sorry.
Whose?

1130
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:56,234
                 A neighbor's.

1131
00:58:56,302 --> 00:58:58,003
Another death
in your neighborhood?

1132
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,270
              The same one.

1133
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:01,205
   The Nazi?

1134
00:59:01,273 --> 00:59:03,408
              He wasn't a Nazi.
              He wasn't in
              the Einsatz group.

1135
00:59:03,476 --> 00:59:06,578
       He was a chef, a cook
       in the goddamn Wehrmacht,
       for--

1136
00:59:08,113 --> 00:59:10,248
           A case
           of mistaken identity.

1137
00:59:10,315 --> 00:59:12,149
That's very bizarre.

1138
00:59:13,819 --> 00:59:16,654
         Anyway, now they gotta
         rebury him as himself.

1139
00:59:16,722 --> 00:59:20,224
        The whole thing's
        affected me very deeply.

1140
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:22,760
Well, I understand,
so send some flowers

1141
00:59:22,828 --> 00:59:24,762

1142
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,732

1143
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,804
       OK, we have
       no specials today.

1144
00:59:32,872 --> 00:59:34,272

1145
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:35,774
                     Me, either.

1146
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,443
     Oh, but you promised!

1147

1148
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,914
What's going on, Jack?

1149
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:46,250
        Look, you don't know me.

1150
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:48,820

    You are a wonderful, loving,
    kind, decent person--

1155

So what's wrong?

1156
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:03,301
            I'm unworthy of you.
            I don't deserve you.

1157
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:05,303
Why, Jack?
What's happened?

1158
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:06,837
               I can't tell you.

you can't tell me?
                 I wish I could.

 want to get involved,

Well, his face was
all covered in black.

1203
01:02:24,009 --> 01:02:26,043
All you could see
were the eyes

1204
01:02:26,111 --> 01:02:28,913
and his lips and teeth
when he smiled.

                  He was wearing
                  a ski mask?

1208
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:40,391
            What kind of a car
            was he driving--

1209
01:02:40,459 --> 01:02:41,559
            foreign or American?

1210
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:44,162
American.
Japanese, I think.

1211
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:46,264

You look great.

            your CDs, your IRAs,

        your insurance policies,

Yeah, leave enough

higher education

1256
01:04:47,953 --> 01:04:50,788

Look, just convert it
to cash,

1259
01:04:53,959 --> 01:04:55,893
put it in a blind trust
for her and her children.

1260
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:57,895
        No, if you put something
        in a blind trust,

01:04:57,963 --> 01:04:59,596
      you can't get to it, ever.

01:04:59,664 --> 01:05:01,598
But I don't want it.
I want her to have it.

1263
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:03,600
           What if later on
           you change your mind,

1264
01:05:03,668 --> 01:05:05,602
            and you <i>don't</i>
            want her to have it?

             the way to show it.
             This is crazy!

            You mind if we

            Professor Lambert?

1287
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,227
No, not at all.

1288
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:39,029
I don't know much,
just what I've read about
in the newspaper,

1289
01:06:39,097 --> 01:06:41,832
seen on television,
just like every
normal, average,

1290
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,534
everyday citizen.

1291
01:06:43,602 --> 01:06:45,403
       Who lives
       on the other side?

1292
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:48,472
That's where Mueller lived.

1293
01:06:48,707 --> 01:06:52,309
      So it's just a hop,
      skip and a jump
      over and back?

1294
01:06:54,546 --> 01:06:58,082
I wouldn't--
           You own a blue Volvo,
           don't you, Professor?

1295
01:06:58,149 --> 01:07:01,719
  Uh, yes. Why?

1296
01:07:01,787 --> 01:07:04,421
As coincidence would have it,
Professor Lambert,

1297
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:07,324
a man wearing a black ski mask
was seen driving a blue Volvo

1298
01:07:07,392 --> 01:07:09,694
in the vicinity
on the night of the murder.

1299
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,829
We vacuumed around
Mueller's apple tree,

1300
01:07:11,897 --> 01:07:13,798
and found these...

1301
01:07:13,866 --> 01:07:15,933
from a black ski mask,

1302
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:19,269
which places the guy
in the Volvo...

1303
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:22,607
at the murder scene.

1304
01:07:22,674 --> 01:07:26,711
   Well, I imagine there are
   thousands of blue Volvos
   out there.

1305
01:07:26,778 --> 01:07:28,445
            There's 238 in Mass,

1306
01:07:28,514 --> 01:07:31,448
               26 in the greater
               Boston area,

1307
01:07:31,517 --> 01:07:34,051
               three in the city
               of Brighton,

1308
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:36,721
                and yours--
                right next door.

1309
01:07:36,788 --> 01:07:38,856
        My Volvo and I
        weren't at home

1310
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:41,526
 or anywhere near the vicinity
 at the time of the murder.

1311
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:43,360
What time was the murder?

1312
01:07:43,428 --> 01:07:46,664
 Whenever you guys said
 the guy in the black ski mask

1313
01:07:46,732 --> 01:07:48,365
    was seen driving around.

1314
01:07:48,433 --> 01:07:49,967
I didn't say.

1315
01:07:50,035 --> 01:07:51,769
   It doesn't really matter,

1316
01:07:51,837 --> 01:07:53,905
       because I was gone
       the entire night.

1317
01:07:53,972 --> 01:07:56,941
       Do you mind telling us
       where you were all night?

1318
01:07:57,009 --> 01:07:58,442
           Certainly.

1319
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:01,679
    ...and after the movies,
    I spent a few hours

1320
01:08:01,747 --> 01:08:03,548
  at a diner near the campus.

1321
01:08:03,615 --> 01:08:05,850
        There's the stub
        from the movie--

1322
01:08:05,951 --> 01:08:08,452
      stub and a receipt.

1323
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,554
            Keeping a scrapbook?

1324
01:08:10,622 --> 01:08:14,124
      No--taxes.
      It was work related.

1325
01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:17,495
      Also, uh, there was
      a-a waitress there

1326
01:08:17,562 --> 01:08:19,997
     who served a terrific
     cup of coffee.

1327
01:08:20,064 --> 01:08:24,067
     In fact, she probably
     signed the guest chit.

1328
01:08:24,135 --> 01:08:26,203
              Yes.

1329
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:28,071
         "Thank you...

1330
01:08:28,139 --> 01:08:29,707
            Patti."

1331
01:08:29,775 --> 01:08:31,809
Thanks for your time.

1332
01:08:33,278 --> 01:08:34,878
      It was just a hunch.

1333
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:39,950
            That bit with
            the apple was great.

1334
01:08:40,018 --> 01:08:42,420
       He'll come around.

1335
01:08:42,487 --> 01:08:45,389
Excuse me?
What do you mean "hunch"?

1336
01:08:45,457 --> 01:08:47,224
A hunch about me,
based on what?

1337
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:48,759
I mean,
that is ridiculous.

1338
01:08:48,827 --> 01:08:50,828
What motive would I have
to kill the man?

1339
01:08:50,895 --> 01:08:54,665
       You attended Mueller's
       last funeral, didn't you?

1340
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:57,134
So what?
You show a little
compassion for people

1341
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:59,436
and it's twisted around
to mean something else?

1342
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:01,605
I happen to be
a very compassionate person.

1343
01:09:01,673 --> 01:09:03,540
In fact, I am known
for my compassion.

1344
01:09:03,608 --> 01:09:07,043
    Which could mean that
    a compassionate person,
    like yourself,

1345
01:09:07,111 --> 01:09:10,381
  sympathetic to the cause
  of the Holocaust survivors,

1346
01:09:10,448 --> 01:09:13,617
    might, seeking revenge,
    kill the Nazi.

1347
01:09:13,685 --> 01:09:16,887
 Then when you discovered
 you killed an innocent person,

1348
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:20,757
    overcome by guilt,
    you attend his funeral.

1349
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:26,797
     Nonsense.

                should we never
                meet again.

1380
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:10,434
Never meet again?
I don't understand.

1381
01:11:10,502 --> 01:11:12,002
         I know. Let me explain.

1382
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:15,739
 You know I have not been happy
 these past few months.

1383
01:11:15,807 --> 01:11:18,409
       There are so many
       bad memories here.

1384
01:11:18,476 --> 01:11:23,079
     I have thought I might
     move to Germany. Hmm?

1385
01:11:23,147 --> 01:11:26,950
I phoned my relatives.
They all encouraged me to come.

1386
01:11:27,018 --> 01:11:30,421
     They say it is a good
     clean place to work
     and raise a family.

1387
01:11:30,488 --> 01:11:32,990
  There are many opportunities
  in the new Europe

1388
01:11:33,058 --> 01:11:34,959
      for someone like me.

1389
01:11:35,026 --> 01:11:37,327
     So, what do you think?

1390
01:11:37,395 --> 01:11:41,732
         I am such a little girl
         when it comes to making
         big decisions.

1391
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,268
It's a good idea.
It sounds like something
I'd like to do myself.

1392
01:11:45,336 --> 01:11:47,104
                Thank you.

1393
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:50,106
              I am going to miss
              relying on you.

1394
01:11:50,174 --> 01:11:52,676
Not if I came along.

1395
01:11:52,744 --> 01:11:54,978
            What are you saying?

1396
01:11:55,046 --> 01:11:59,082
Well, you know,
frankly I'm kind of sick
of living here, too,

1397
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,984
here in Brighton,

1398
01:12:01,052 --> 01:12:03,253
where I've been
ever since I got my PhD.

1399
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:05,489
And I've always wanted
to live in Europe.

1400
01:12:05,557 --> 01:12:07,891
             But what about your
             teaching career?

1401
01:12:07,959 --> 01:12:10,527
Well, ethics is
an international subject.

1402
01:12:10,595 --> 01:12:12,830
There's an American
university in Heidelberg.

1403
01:12:12,898 --> 01:12:15,166
I'll learn German,
whatever.

1404
01:12:15,233 --> 01:12:18,669
                   Jack. Jack.

1405
01:12:18,736 --> 01:12:21,105
          Are you saying that...

1406
01:12:21,173 --> 01:12:23,274
          you like me that much?

1407
01:12:25,043 --> 01:12:26,977
Inga, please have
a seat here

1408
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:30,414
                 and just listen
                 very carefully.

1409
01:12:33,518 --> 01:12:35,953
You said that I was
part of your family.

1410
01:12:36,021 --> 01:12:38,455
Well, I like being part
of your family,

1411
01:12:38,523 --> 01:12:41,258
and it's something
I'd like to continue doing.

1412
01:12:41,326 --> 01:12:43,627
        That would be wonderful.

1413
01:12:43,662 --> 01:12:45,529
So it's settled.

1414
01:12:45,563 --> 01:12:47,464
        That would be wonderful.

1415
01:12:47,532 --> 01:12:49,199
Well, great.

1416
01:12:49,266 --> 01:12:50,901
                  Wait a minute.

1417
01:12:50,969 --> 01:12:54,805
               Jack, you are not
               talking about us

1418
01:12:54,873 --> 01:12:56,072
                living together?

1419
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,774
   Oh, God, no!

1420
01:12:57,842 --> 01:13:01,645
No, I mean,
that never entered my mind
for a moment, that thought.

1421
01:13:01,713 --> 01:13:02,880
                    Good.

1422
01:13:02,947 --> 01:13:04,715
             I am old-fashioned.

1423
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:07,651
                  Well...

1424
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:11,454
              I would be honored
              to marry you.

you phrase things, Jack.

1451
01:14:57,328 --> 01:14:59,296
I think you
are hilarious.

1452
01:15:00,966 --> 01:15:02,633
                   Really?

1453
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:05,703
           I don't ever remember
           you laughing at any
           of my remarks.

1454
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,205
Oh, often later,
when I am alone,

1455
01:15:08,272 --> 01:15:11,709
I will chuckle out loud
over something you have said.

1456
01:15:11,776 --> 01:15:16,312
            Why not just chuckle
            when I say it?

1457
01:15:16,548 --> 01:15:19,116
I am guarded
with people, Jack,

1458
01:15:19,184 --> 01:15:23,820
but when I am by myself,
I am very outgoing.

1459
01:15:23,889 --> 01:15:28,225
     Maybe sometime I can be
     with you when you're alone.

1460
01:15:28,293 --> 01:15:30,794
You remind me of my father.

1461
01:15:30,862 --> 01:15:33,764
He was also very funny.

        You?

1479
01:16:36,094 --> 01:16:38,362
        I don't like having sex.

01:16:39,864 --> 01:16:41,731

1481
01:16:41,799 --> 01:16:43,300
                        No.

1482
01:16:43,368 --> 01:16:45,569
                 No, I have
                 never liked it.

1483
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:50,407
             Maybe I should have
             told you first.

1484
01:16:51,976 --> 01:16:53,877
You might have
mentioned it,

1485
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:55,678
but it really
doesn't matter.

1486
01:16:55,746 --> 01:16:58,081
                   Ah. Oh, good.

1487
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:02,519
     I honestly thought with you
     it would be different...

1488
01:17:02,586 --> 01:17:04,421
      because you are so giving.

1489
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,958

           of course,

1491
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,794
                 It is my duty.

1492
01:17:12,696 --> 01:17:15,865
Please, Inga, try not
to think about it.

1493
01:17:15,934 --> 01:17:17,801
Don't even worry
about it, all right?

1494
01:17:17,869 --> 01:17:19,169
I'll see you
in the morning.

1495
01:17:19,237 --> 01:17:20,604
                       OK.

1496
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,407
                    Good deal.

No, thanks.

1499
01:17:46,998 --> 01:17:50,300
     Remember, Jack, when you
     told me you wanted to share

1500
01:17:50,302 --> 01:17:52,468
         all my burdens in life?

1501
01:17:52,536 --> 01:17:54,571
      Uh-huh.

1502
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:57,607
           I have always wanted
           to share my life
           with a man.

1503
01:17:57,642 --> 01:18:00,510
      My husband was a macho man
      who would not listen.

1504
01:18:00,578 --> 01:18:01,611
          Not like you.

1505
01:18:03,448 --> 01:18:06,149
          But I feel I can share
          anything with you.

1506
01:18:09,087 --> 01:18:12,055
          Can I tell you
          my secrets, darling?

1507
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:14,624
Uh, in the morning, dear.

1508
01:18:20,264 --> 01:18:22,933
          My father <i>was</i>
          The Beast of Berkau.

1509
01:18:26,838 --> 01:18:28,505
  Say that again.

1510
01:18:28,572 --> 01:18:31,141
     My father was Karl Luger...

1511
01:18:32,343 --> 01:18:34,311
           not Max Mueller.

1512
01:18:34,378 --> 01:18:37,280
That--that's impossible,

1513
01:18:37,348 --> 01:18:40,283
because the war files
prove that--

1514
01:18:40,351 --> 01:18:42,386
                 No, no, no.
                 Oh, no, listen.

1515
01:18:43,787 --> 01:18:46,490
              That file was
              a forgery, a fake.

1516
01:18:46,557 --> 01:18:48,791
              My father was
              in SS Intelligence

1517
01:18:48,859 --> 01:18:50,894
      and could do these things.

1518
01:18:50,961 --> 01:18:53,397
             Late in the war,
             to protect himself,

1519
01:18:53,464 --> 01:18:55,598
             he created a file
             for a Max Mueller

1520
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:57,835
            but using his own
            photo identification

1521
01:18:57,902 --> 01:18:59,770
             and dental records.

1522
01:18:59,838 --> 01:19:02,172
             And so he became
             Max Mueller.

1523
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,943
      This file was lost
      during my father's escape.

1524
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:08,444
             We kept hoping
             it would be found.

1525
01:19:08,512 --> 01:19:12,115
           It popped up finally,
           but too late.

1526
01:19:12,183 --> 01:19:15,084
So let me get this straight.

1527
01:19:15,152 --> 01:19:16,820
What you're telling me

1528
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:19,222
is that the man
who was poisoned to death

1529
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:20,857
was really Karl Luger.

1530
01:19:20,925 --> 01:19:22,392
                       Yes.

1531
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,195
So you're the daughter
of The Beast of Berkau.

1532
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:26,763
                         Yes.

1533
01:19:26,831 --> 01:19:29,433
And I'm his son-in-law.
                       Yes.

1534
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,001
         Believe me, I know what
         you are going through.

1535
01:19:32,069 --> 01:19:33,903
                         Jack?
Could you not--
Just for a second.

1536
01:19:33,971 --> 01:19:36,340
          You are the only other
          person in the world
          who knows.

1537
01:19:36,407 --> 01:19:39,209
            Promise me, you will
            tell no one, <i>no one.</i>

1538
01:19:39,277 --> 01:19:41,278
What, are you kidding?
Oh, no, I'm telling everyone!

1539
01:19:41,346 --> 01:19:42,779
        I will deny it.

1540
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,781
    I told you
    what it was like for us

1541
01:19:44,849 --> 01:19:46,783
     when my father
     was exposed as a Nazi!

1542
01:19:46,851 --> 01:19:48,285
         Could you please just--

1543
01:19:48,353 --> 01:19:50,354
  To the world,
  my father was Max Mueller!

1544
01:19:50,421 --> 01:19:53,557
       I am Inga Mueller.
                   Please wait.
                   I'm thinking.

1545
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:57,227
     I would deny it, Jack,
     to my dying breath for
     the sake of the twins.

1546
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:58,929
                 Fuck the twins!

1547
01:19:58,997 --> 01:20:01,264
      I knew I should
      never have told you.

1548
01:20:01,332 --> 01:20:03,266
             Of course,
             you'd love to go on

1549
01:20:03,334 --> 01:20:05,669
         perpetuating this fraud
         for your own self--

1550
01:20:05,737 --> 01:20:08,672
           Inga, there are
           other families, Inga.

1551
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,807
                 Yours is not
                 the only family
                 in the world.

1552
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:13,343
     There are millions of other
     families involved in this,

1553
01:20:13,411 --> 01:20:15,178
            families who deserve
            to know the truth.

1554
01:20:15,246 --> 01:20:17,047
             Don't you care
             about them at all?

1555
01:20:17,114 --> 01:20:20,584
  Don't people have any feelings
  for each other at all,
  for God's sake?!

1556
01:20:20,652 --> 01:20:22,019
     Stop it!

1557
01:20:22,086 --> 01:20:24,454
You frighten me
when you talk this way.

1558
01:20:24,522 --> 01:20:26,924
You sound like
that "Sincere" madman.

1559
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:28,558
             I am that madman.

1560
01:20:29,793 --> 01:20:31,261
What are you saying?

1561
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:33,663
              I am that madman.

1562
01:20:34,999 --> 01:20:38,134
  Is true?
                 It had nothing
                 to do with you.

1563
01:20:38,202 --> 01:20:41,171
This is true?
                Listen, listen.

1564
01:20:41,238 --> 01:20:43,072
              Please, it was
              beyond my control.

1565
01:20:43,308 --> 01:20:45,275
Oh, my God, no.
      Sometimes you're compelled
      to do something.

1566
01:20:45,343 --> 01:20:47,577
              You have a feeling
              of what's wrong,

1567
01:20:47,645 --> 01:20:49,646
           and you feel
           you can set it right.

1568
01:20:49,713 --> 01:20:51,047
      Wait, wait...

1569
01:20:51,115 --> 01:20:52,849
You kill the father...
                   Inga, please.

1570
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:55,885
and then you
fornicate the daughter?

1571
01:20:55,953 --> 01:20:58,655
                      No, no!
Ohh, what kind
of animal are you?

1572
01:20:58,722 --> 01:21:00,089
             It wasn't that way.

1573
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:01,158
    Aah! Aah! Aah!

1574
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,161
Oh, God, help me! Help me!

1575
01:21:04,228 --> 01:21:05,662
Help me, please, God.

1576
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:09,466
Somebody call the police!
Police!

1577
01:21:09,534 --> 01:21:11,434
        <i>(sirens wailing) </i>

1578
01:21:19,477 --> 01:21:21,711
                 Jack?
    Marty!

1579
01:21:21,778 --> 01:21:23,179
                     Jack!

1580
01:21:23,247 --> 01:21:25,715
          Is this true
          that you killed a man?

1581
01:21:25,782 --> 01:21:28,051
Yes, but I killed
the right man.

1582
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:30,387
                I don't think
                that's a defense
                in this country.

1583
01:21:30,454 --> 01:21:33,390
No, look, they say here
I killed a man named
Max Mueller.

1584
01:21:33,457 --> 01:21:36,659
I didn't.
I killed Karl Luger,
the Nazi war criminal.

1585
01:21:36,727 --> 01:21:38,661
That's the heart
of my defense!

1586
01:21:38,729 --> 01:21:40,664
            Wait. Mueller.
            Is this any relation

1587
01:21:40,731 --> 01:21:42,799
            to the lady you gave
            all that money to?

1588
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:44,668
You mean my wife.

1589
01:21:44,736 --> 01:21:46,737
  Yes.

1590
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:49,038
Now, she is gonna be
a key witness,

1591
01:21:49,106 --> 01:21:51,574
probably for <i>both</i> sides,
if that's possible.

1592
01:21:51,642 --> 01:21:53,075
I need to know,
is that possible?

1593
01:21:53,143 --> 01:21:54,877
And what's
a hostile witness?

1594
01:21:54,945 --> 01:21:56,913
           I'll walk you through
           the arraignment,

1595
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:00,049
      but then you're gonna need
      a criminal attorney,

1596
01:22:00,117 --> 01:22:01,217
               a good one.

1597
01:22:01,285 --> 01:22:04,954
OK, thanks, Marty.
                  Come here.

1598
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,924
     I'm with you on this, Jack.

1599
01:22:07,991 --> 01:22:09,826
            You can always count
            on family.

1600
01:22:09,893 --> 01:22:11,328
            We may piss you off,

1601
01:22:11,395 --> 01:22:13,296
           we may screw with you
           on business,

1602
01:22:13,364 --> 01:22:14,864
           but we never condemn.

1603
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:18,869
Good. See you in court.

1604
01:22:45,362 --> 01:22:47,597
                  OK. Marty,
                  I got a plan.

1605
01:22:47,665 --> 01:22:48,799
             What?

1606
01:22:48,866 --> 01:22:50,801
               No plea bargains,
               no deals.

1607
01:22:50,868 --> 01:22:52,903
   I think
   that's <i>their</i> plan.

1608
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:55,505
We can make a case,
but we need more
physical evidence.

1609
01:22:55,573 --> 01:22:58,241
           Get us an indictment.
    We'll get you everything
    you need.

1610
01:22:58,309 --> 01:23:00,210
                   He's our man.
Yeah, I know.

1611
01:23:00,277 --> 01:23:04,014
           Docket number 1175-D.

1612
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:05,415
 <i>The State</i> vs <i>Jack Lambert,</i>

1613
01:23:05,483 --> 01:23:07,951
felony count,
first degree murder.

1614
01:23:08,018 --> 01:23:09,485
       How do you plead?

1615
01:23:09,553 --> 01:23:12,655
Your Honor,
could I approach
the bench, please?

1616
01:23:13,957 --> 01:23:15,459
                 Get me a trial.

1617
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:21,631
                     Hi.

1618
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:25,101
            I haven't been
            in a courtroom since
            college, Your Honor.

1619
01:23:25,169 --> 01:23:28,638
         I'm a tax attorney now,
         but the defendant's
         my brother.

1620
01:23:28,706 --> 01:23:31,608
  Interesting.
  Are you prepared
  to enter a plea, Counselor?

1621
01:23:31,676 --> 01:23:34,811
         Absolutely,
         but I'm wondering
         if you could refresh me

1622
01:23:34,879 --> 01:23:36,246
         on what my options
         are here.

1623
01:23:36,313 --> 01:23:39,515
     Certainly.
     Guilty or not guilty.

1624
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:41,484
                 Fair enough,

1625
01:23:41,552 --> 01:23:44,453
             but couldn't I also
             ask for a dismissal
             of all charges?

1626
01:23:44,521 --> 01:23:45,588
          You can ask.

1627
01:23:45,656 --> 01:23:48,091
The State recommends
that no bail be granted.

1628
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,594
The suspect was apprehended
fleeing the country.

1629
01:23:50,661 --> 01:23:52,095
                  What? Fleeing!

1630
01:23:52,162 --> 01:23:54,431
        He was on his honeymoon,
        Your Honor.

1631
01:23:55,566 --> 01:23:57,500
  <i>So, I'll get my day in court,</i>

1632
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,703
  <i>and the truth will come out.</i>

1633
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,871
      <i>But even though </i>
      <i>I committed a crime,</i>

1634
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:03,707
       <i>I solved one, too.</i>

1635
01:24:03,774 --> 01:24:07,143
    <i>Hey, you know, that might</i>
    <i>reduce my sentence.</i>

1636
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:09,145
      How did you come
      to arrest this man?

1637
01:24:09,213 --> 01:24:11,314
He confessed the murder
to his wife.

1638
01:24:11,382 --> 01:24:12,915
             Wait a minute.

1639
01:24:12,983 --> 01:24:16,119
           A wife cannot testify
           against her husband,
           I do know that.

1640
01:24:16,186 --> 01:24:17,621
         No, you don't,
         Counselor.

1641
01:24:17,688 --> 01:24:21,190
A wife cannot be forced
to testify, but she may
do so willingly.

1642
01:24:21,259 --> 01:24:23,593
   I don't see her statement.

1643
01:24:23,761 --> 01:24:26,263
She recanted, Your Honor,
said she was under
a lot of stress,

1644
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:28,532
was hysterical,
and wasn't sure
of what she heard,

1645
01:24:28,599 --> 01:24:31,201
but we have a hunch
she was telling the truth.

1646
01:24:31,268 --> 01:24:33,503
Maybe she didn't want
the trauma of a trial,

1647
01:24:33,571 --> 01:24:36,005
but the defendant was already
the number one suspect.

1648
01:24:36,073 --> 01:24:38,608
There's an overwhelming amount
of circumstantial evidence.

1649
01:24:38,676 --> 01:24:41,545
 I think I'm ready to make
 a determination in this case.

1650
01:24:41,612 --> 01:24:44,381
    Why don't you two return
    to your places?

1651
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:49,052
   <i>Nice how this thing formed</i>
   <i>a complete moral circle.</i>

1652
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,054
   <i>Luger paid for his crimes,</i>

1653
01:24:51,122 --> 01:24:52,722
     <i>and I'll pay for mine.</i>

1654
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:56,426
    I am reluctant to accept
    a plea in this case.

1655
01:24:56,493 --> 01:24:58,995
  The State may wish
  to characterize its evidence

1656
01:24:59,063 --> 01:25:00,764
       as circumstantial.

1657
01:25:00,832 --> 01:25:03,667
 I find it merely coincidental.

1658
01:25:03,734 --> 01:25:06,135
     There is no eyewitness

1659
01:25:06,203 --> 01:25:08,304
     or any other
     corroborating evidence

1660
01:25:08,372 --> 01:25:11,174
      placing the suspect
      at the scene.

1661
01:25:11,242 --> 01:25:12,909
    This case is dismissed.

1662
01:25:12,977 --> 01:25:15,345
     Enjoy your honeymoon,
     Professor Lambert.

1663
01:25:15,412 --> 01:25:18,314
     Dismissed? What does
     that mean, dismissed?

1664
01:25:19,584 --> 01:25:20,917
              What's going on?

1665
01:25:20,985 --> 01:25:24,821
 Um...you're free.

1666
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:27,591
                What, on bail?
No, you're out, period.

1667
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:29,425
Jack, weren't you listening?

1668
01:25:29,494 --> 01:25:31,427
The judge just dismissed
the case.

1669
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:33,563
          What do you mean? Why?

1670
01:25:33,631 --> 01:25:36,933
They didn't have any evidence.
And when your wife refused
to testify--

1671
01:25:37,001 --> 01:25:39,469
          She's not gonna
          want to testify.
          You have to force her.

1672
01:25:39,537 --> 01:25:40,737
             What have you done?

1673
01:25:40,805 --> 01:25:42,973
Cheer up, kid.
You got away with murder.

1674
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,008
           Stop saying that.
           Where are they going?

1675
01:25:45,075 --> 01:25:48,712
Shut up and let's
get out of here.
  No, Marty, everybody, wait!

1676
01:25:50,615 --> 01:25:52,782
        No, wait! Wait.

1677
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,951
 Please--please, there's more.

1678
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:57,453
       Don't you want
       to know the truth?

1679
01:26:07,197 --> 01:26:09,799
    You call this justice?!

1680
01:26:30,654 --> 01:26:33,323
       <i>I went directly</i>
       <i>from court to bed,</i>

1681
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:35,325
     <i>took a leave</i>
     <i>of absence from school</i>

1682
01:26:35,392 --> 01:26:37,393
 <i>and just laid around thinking,</i>

1683
01:26:37,461 --> 01:26:39,362
 <i>and I came to one conclusion--</i>

1684
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:41,664
  <i>I'm glad I got away with it.</i>

1685
01:26:41,731 --> 01:26:43,699
      <i>I'm a very lucky man.</i>

1686
01:26:43,767 --> 01:26:47,337
  <i>Anyway, I received</i>
  <i>an annulment notice from Inga</i>

1687
01:26:47,404 --> 01:26:48,704
     <i>postmarked Duesseldorf,</i>

1688
01:26:48,772 --> 01:26:51,040
    <i>and surprisingly,</i>
    <i>I got a letter from Gail.</i>

1689
01:26:51,108 --> 01:26:53,509
   <i>She'd heard about the case,</i>
   <i>put two and two together,</i>

1690
01:26:53,577 --> 01:26:55,511
  <i>and wanted to know the truth.</i>

1691
01:26:55,579 --> 01:26:57,513
   <i>So I confessed everything.</i>

1692
01:26:57,581 --> 01:26:59,515
    <i>She was put off at first,</i>

1693
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:01,717
        <i>but then she felt</i>
        <i>kind of flattered</i>

1694
01:27:01,785 --> 01:27:05,121
 <i>that I thought the worst thing</i>
 <i>I could do to myself</i>
 <i>was give her up.</i>

1695
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:08,524
   <i>She agreed to see me again,</i>
   <i>and we caught up on stuff.</i>

1696
01:27:08,592 --> 01:27:10,926
      <i>I explained that</i>
      <i>after what I'd done,</i>

1697
01:27:10,995 --> 01:27:14,330
    <i>I didn't really</i>
    <i>think I was pure enough</i>
    <i>to teach ethics anymore,</i>

1698
01:27:14,398 --> 01:27:14,330
   <i>so I'd entered law school.</i>
