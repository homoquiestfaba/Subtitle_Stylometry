00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,719
[man on radio] If you're heading
into Manhattan, it's a real stinker today.

4
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:12,014
All major routes between Downtown
and Midtown are jammed.

5
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:15,517
If you're trying to get to Midtown
do yourself a favor, jump on the subway.

I'm taking your train.

Whoa! What the hell are you doing?

29

-Just answer the question.

34

What do you see?

35
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,628
I see a man
leaning against the front car.

36
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:39,382
When he gets on, you shut the doors.

37
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,385
All right.

Yeah, it wasn't my fault.

48
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:35,772
This train bucks all the time,
especially in switching.

Command Center
will call in about a minute.

59

You will not answer. Is that clear?

60

Yes, sir. They can call all they want.
I'm deaf. I'm out of it.

Hey, mister, what's going on?

68
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:53,766
-Thank you, Mr. Grey.
-Don't mention, Mr. Green.

Thank you.

-Look at it, Caz.
-What?

80
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,021
Stonehouse, what's the problem?

81
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,857
[Frank] I got a southbound local,
he's laying down between 23rd and 28th.

-[man] How long?
-A couple, three minutes.

83
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:47,487
I tried to raise him with the radio
but he won't answer the radio.

84
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,615
-Why won't he answer the radio?
-Don't worry. It could be a lot of things.

00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,362
Forward this time.

[beeps]

112
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,033
Oh, my God! She's split! Look at this.

113
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,786
-Yeah, I can see that.
-I've never seen that done.

-Who's with you?
-Uh, nobody.

126
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,791
I mean, my mom is meeting us.

127
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,548
She said to call 911 if we're not home
in exactly 38 hours.

128
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:54,549
Uh, minutes.

129
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,802
This is not gonna happen.

130

See that red dot on your chest?

131
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,060
If I squeeze this trigger,
I'll fill it with 850 rounds a minute.

132
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:07,186
Sit down.

133
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:09,439
Sit down!

134
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,283
Very good.

135
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,836
You want a pack of gum?

136
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:35,840
Take it.

[man]
He has stopped again.

140
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:53,858
[Frank] Hey, people,
I got cars piling up here.

141
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,318
What's he doing now?

142
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,362
Pelham 123, come in, please!
What are they doing now?

143
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,698
What a couple of mental cases.
I'm going down there.

144
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:04,243
Command Center to Pelham 123,
come in, please!

145
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,456
[Mr. Blue]
Train operator!

146
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,627
-Yes, sir?
-[Mr. Blue] Come to me.

147
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,378
Come!

148
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:21,636
All right, this is what I want you to do.

149
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,555
I want you to go back to those five cars
that we cut loose.

150
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,265
I want you to gather those people together

151
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:28,851
and walk them back
to the 28th Street Station. You got that?

152
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,605
People hate getting off
in a middle of a tunnel.

153
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:36,108
-Please shut up and just do it.
-Yes, sir.

154
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:41,697
Please let me off.
I have a doctor's appointment.

155
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,202
-No.
-Come on, lady. Sit down.

156
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,579
Please.

157
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:51,666
The same thing happened to me
on the Long Island Railroad. I swear.

158
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,501
I couldn't go through it all over again.

159
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,753
Nobody leaves.

160
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,464
Sit down, lady. [sniffs]

161
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:00,383
Okay. Except my brother.

162
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,929
-Nobody leaves.
-Come on. He's just a kid.

163
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,931
-Quiet up, little man.
-Sit down.

164
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,601
Oh, excuse me, mister.

165
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:14,021
Don't you think you should let us in
on what's going on?

166
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:15,648
-Maybe we could help.
-[door opens]

167
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:23,614
You're being held by four dangerous people
with automatic weapons.

168
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,324
That's what's going on.

169
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:27,994
Is that clear?

170
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,932

00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:05,865
[people screaming indistinctly]

175
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:09,285
-[man] Hey, what's going on?
-Hey, hey, calm down.

176
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,203
-All right, calm down!
-[screaming stops]

177
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,372
Sit down.

178
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:22,298
Sit down.

179
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:56,999
-[device beeping]
-[Mr. Green sighing]

180
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:03,673

00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:07,426
-[coughs]
-[Frank speaking over radio, indistinct]

182
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,347
Motion detector is in place.

183
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,850
Power is out between 14th and 33rd.
All four tracks.

184
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:17,687
Local express, northbound and south.

185
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,231
-I still see lights on the tunnel.
-Emergency lighting.

186
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,608
They're on AC, just like the signals.

187
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:30,992
Do you read me?
Pelham 123, come in, please.

188
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,411
She's still laying dead.

189
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,289
-What time you got, Mr. Green?
-I got 3:10.

190
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,876
Command Center to Pelham 123.

191
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,837
Did you cut the electricity down there?

192
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:45,589
Answer me.

193
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,926
-It's time to talk to them.
-[clears throat]

194
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,053
[coughs]

195
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:53,180
-[sniffs]
-Are you all right?

196
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:54,807
This thing's gonna kill me.

197
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,852
-That's entirely possible.
-[sighs]

198
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:04,275
This is Pelham 123 to Command Center,
do you read me?

199
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,153
Yeah. I read you, you maniac!
Where the hell have you been?

200
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,197
Do you know that Caz Holowitcz

201
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:12,867
is personally coming down there
to fry your ass?

202
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,872
We have taken your train.
I repeat, we have taken your train.

203
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:21,417
[people chattering]

204
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,131
Everybody just shut up, okay?
Just wait--

205
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,799
-Shut up in here now!
-[chattering stops]

206
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:35,848
Pelham 123...

207
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,019
what exactly do you mean
that the train has been taken?

208
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,772
-Are you the operator?
-Negative.

209
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,192
-Then who are you?
-We have hijacked your train.

210
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:48,986
What?

211
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,696
[Mr. Blue]
We are heavily armed.

212
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,616
We are holding hostages,
and we will not hesitate to kill any

213
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,619
and all of them
if you do not do precisely as we say.

214
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,953
Am I making myself clear?

215
00:17:58,871 --> 00:17:59,955
Absolutely, yes. Sure.

216
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,000
[beeps]

217
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,711
Do not bother using your six wire.

218
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,296
I will communicate

219
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,508
only with the New York City Police
Hostage Negotiation Team,

220
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,884
nobody else.

221
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:12,843
That's all.

222
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:16,514
[sniffs]

223
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,352
[phone ringing]

224
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,568
-Yeah?
-Detective Specialist Inez Raye, please.

225
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,822
-Prescotti?
-Hey! I didn't recognized your voice.

226
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,991
-How's the transit authority?
-Hey, you must miss me, right?

227
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,827
Glad to be out of the real world?

228
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,413
I'm not out of it right now. We got
some psycho that just hijacked a train.

229
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,916
How fast can you get over
to the 42nd Street Command Center?

230
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,043
-I'll be right over.
-[Prescotti] All right, hurry up.

231
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:48,921
[Mr. Green sighing]

232
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:56,971
[sniffs]

233
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,724
-[Mr. Blue] Perimeter clear?
-Clear as day.

234
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,060
[sighs]

235
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:05,771
[sighs]

236
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,448
[machine hums]

237
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,909
[monitor beeping]

238
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,291
[Frank] Listen, are you gonna wait
for your partner or you wanna, uh--?

239
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,630
[Prescotti]
We hear you, Pelham 123. We hear you.

240
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:34,925
Hello. Can you hear us?
Can you hear us? Come in, please.

241
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,178
Identify yourself.

242
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:41,223
Yeah, I'm Detective Prescotti
of the Negotiation team.

243
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:44,727
Can you tell me your name?
What would you like me to call you?

244
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,272
Give me something so that we can talk
to each other. How about that, huh?

245
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,194
-Call me Blue.
-All right, Blue.

246
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:57,489
Call me Anthony, all right?
Why don't you tell me in your own words

247
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,992
what's going on down there?
I'd like to hear it from you.

248
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,664
Anthony, we have 14 hostages,
including two children.

249
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:09,168
And we will kill one
every time you do not follow our commands.

250
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,295
I hope that's clear.

251
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,839
Listen, there's no reason
for anybody to get hurt.

252
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,424
We're gonna work through this, okay?

253
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,969
[Blue]
We demand five million dollars in cash

254
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:22,514
for the release of the subway car
and all the hostages.

255
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,393
It is now 3:13.

256
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:30,356
The money must be in our hands by 4:13.

257
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,733
One hour from now.

258
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,610
I know your capabilities.

259
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:39,114
At precisely 4:13,
we will execute one hostage

260
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,325
for every minute you are late.

261
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,161
When you've contacted the mayor's office,

262
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,538
report back to me
for further instructions.

263
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,916
All right, let me see
if I got this straight, okay?

264
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,460
These demands are not negotiable.

265
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:55,589
We got 14 people. Two are kids.
They want five million.

266
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:59,176
Okay. But let's make sure we understand
that no one has to get hurt.

267
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:03,055
Blue, come in.

268
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,225
Pelham 123, this is Command Center.

269
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,727
I got to find out
that I have everything together on this.

270
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,980
Please, Blue, come back to me.
Come back, Blue.

271
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,692
Blue, come in, come in.
Pelham 123, come in.

272
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,487
[people chattering]

273
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,905
[woman]
This is ridiculous.

274
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,115
What's the hold up?

275
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:24,243
Something on the track?
Is it a jumper or a pusher?

276
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,744
I believe
it's a mechanical problem, ma'am.

277
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,664
-[man over radio] Central to Post 17.
-Excuse me. Post 17. Go ahead, Central.

278
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,165
[man]
Call by landline immediately.

279
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,875
-Uh-huh.
-[man] Do you copy?

280
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:32,793
Yeah.

281
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,503
[man 1]
Hey, officer, what's going on here?

282
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,338
[man 2]
Yeah, what's going on around here?

283
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:42,886
Hey, officer, I'm talking to you.
What are you, on a break?

284
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,139
-Calling your bookie?
-[phone rings]

285
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,598
Take the bus, ma'am.

286
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:47,891
Post 17, what do we got?

287
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,893
[man over phone]
A subway car has been hijacked.

288
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,980
There are hostages involved,
we're not putting it out on the radio.

289
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,691
We're trying to keep the media out of it
as long as possible.

290
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:56,608
I read you.

291
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,736
[man] There's a transit
authority supervisor down there

292
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,571
somewhere between 28th and 14th.

293
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,699
I saw him a couple of minutes ago.
He was headed down track on foot.

294
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,617
[man]
Find him and get him out!

295
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,247
[man]
Officer, are you listening?

296
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,417
[officer] Post 17 to Central,
I'm looking down the tunnel now.

297
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,336
I don't see him. I'm going in after him.

298
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,756
[people chattering]

299
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,976
[Caz] Where are you going?
Your job is to stay on that train.

300
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,187
-They said they'd kill me.
-You're like the captain of a ship.

301
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,689
-You're supposed to go down with it.
-That young woman conductor is going down,

302
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:38,484
-I'd do it for you?
-Excuse me, do you work for the subway?

303
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,153
You butt out! Tell Command Central
I'm on my way to investigate.

304
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,947
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.
-I know you wouldn't.

305
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,992
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Which is the famous third rail?

306
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:48,702
That's it.
Six hundred and twenty-five volts.

307
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:52,706
-[chuckles] Fry you to a crisp.
-If the power is on, which it ain't.

308
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,168
Let's cut through the fat real quick.
He's not negotiating.

309
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,505
He's determined to complete the job.
He's a consummate pro.

310
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,508
He'll only talk to us on his terms
when he wants to.

311
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:06,303
-Yeah, I wouldn't wait for him to call.
-You should be sitting in this seat.

312
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:09,932
You got here first.
I'll coach and you can be the hero.

313
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:11,558
Thanks a lot.

314
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:19,191
-This is boring.
-Be happy it's so boring.

315
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,528
-Shut up.
-Yeah.

316
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,948
-You know, why don't you let the kids go?
-Nobody asked you, bitch.

317
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,825
-Yo, watch your mouth.
-Watch yours.

318
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,661
Yo, nobody means any disrespect.

319
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,165
I'm sorry. My bad. All right?

320
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,127
You got kids here. It's unpredictable.

321
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,338
I'm just saying
that you should let 'em go. That's all.

322
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,925
Nobody's supposed to talk.

323
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,178
Nobody's talking.

324
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,391
Do you mind not pointing that gun?

325
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,021
[whispers]
Shoot him.

326
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,158
[sighs]

327
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,164
Hey.

328
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,585
Do you like pornography?

329
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:21,920
Hmm?

330
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,089
I do.

331
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:26,467
Huh?

332
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,387
Do you like guns?

333
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,393
This is a really cool gun.

334
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,524
What's your name, huh?

335
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,654
Come on. Whisper it to me.

336
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,200
Shaky.

337
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,452
I'll call you "Shaky".

338
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,495
[chuckles]

339
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,839
Hey.

340
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,592
Shaky.

341
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,511
Mr. Grey.

342
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,141
-[sighs]
-Can I see you a moment, please?

343
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,187
Keep my seat warm.

344
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,285
Yeah?

345
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,956
Leave the woman alone.

346
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,459
Just stand here, Mr. Grey.

347
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,010
"Stand here, Mr. Grey", what?

348
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,891
"Stand here, Mr. Grey", what?

349
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:08,151
What's the magic word... Mr. Blue?

350
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,784
Money.

351
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,052
[door lock clicking]

352
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,097
[chuckles]

353
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,434
What?

354
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,646
[Anthony]
Hello, Blue. Pelham 123, come in.

355
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:48,191
Come in, Pelham 123. Do you hear me?
Pelham 123, come in.

356
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,444
Do you have authorization
from the mayor's office

357
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,029
to pay the five million dollars?

358
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,822
No, not yet.

359
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,616
[Mr. Blue]
You have 49 minutes.

360
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,870
-[Anthony] Listen...
-And we will execute a hostage.

361
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:02,289
Listen, it's gonna take time
to get that kind of money.

362
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,541
You know that, Blue. And that's the truth.

363
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,835
Now, do you want me
to tell you the truth here

364
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,754
or do you want me to lie to you?

365
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,965
Truth would be less costly
for the people on this train.

366
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,092
[Anthony]
Good. Then we understand each other.

367
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:17,262
Now... You got two kids on the train.

368
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,390
Yes. Your point being?

369
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:23,310
Well, I can tell you I got one.

370
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,312
They get hungry, they get antsy.

371
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,022
They're a factor that you can't control.

372
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,940
Why don't we just release the children?

373
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:31,735
-The children stay.
-[sneezes]

374
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:32,986
Bless you.

375
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,616
Everything that you try to do to cooperate
is gonna work in your favor.

376
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,243
Every person that you release
is another argument

377
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,329
your attorney can make
before the judge.

378
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,916
-No, no, no. I will not be judged.
-[sniffs]

379
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,543
What does that mean?

380
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:54,216
You have 48 minutes. Thank you.

381
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,386
[Anthony]
Blue, come on. Just stay with me, Blue.

382
00:27:58,553 --> 00:27:59,596
This guy won't budge.

383
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,181
I got to pee.

384
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,894
-You got to go to the bathroom.
-Quiet.

385
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:09,022
He's got to go to the bathroom.
You have to let him go.

386
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,942
-Yeah, he can hold it.
-Come on. It could get nasty.

387
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,946
[sighs]

388
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,864
Brown.

389
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,658
-What?
-Kid's got to pee.

390
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,159
[Brown]
So?

391
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,662
-So take him.
-Why me?

392
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:24,913
Just do it.

393
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,540
I'll take him. Come on, babe.

394
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,335
Not you. Sit down.

395
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,228
Where's the bathroom?

396
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,857
You're just gonna have to go
off the edge, all right, babe?

397
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,025
-Don't look.
-[woman] I promise.

398
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,580
So what's that supposed to be?

399
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:12,377
-It's a solid gold M16.
-Nice thing to wear around your neck.

400
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:16,047
Is that supposed to make you bad?

401
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,468
-We're not supposed to talk to you.
-Come on.

402
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,511
It's just us.

403
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,388
Bad guys are over there.

404
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,017
I was bad too.

405
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,561
I was so bad.

406
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,564
I was so bad, they took my baby away.

407
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,191
So?

408
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,276
So now I don't hangout
with my old friends

409
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,236
who ain't got no damn life.

410
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:43,074
I got me a job, and I got my son back.

411
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,952
He's four years old now.
He's got his whole life ahead of him.

412
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,079
You know that?
Just like this little kid right here.

413
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,500
Come on, Brown.

414
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,128
Just say he escaped. Say it was my fault.

415
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,383
They'd kill you.

416
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:08,642
Come on.

417
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:22,781
Detectives Raye, Prescotti, deputy mayor.

418
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,158
-Hello.
-[Anthony] Hi, how are you?

419
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:26,284
What about the ransom?

420
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:30,580
The mayor will not allow himself to be
boxed into a corner by a bunch of crazies.

421
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:33,250
With all due respect,
but these people are not crazy.

422
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,501
It's reasonable and prudent

423
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,754
to suppose you can hijack a train,
get five million dollars in cash,

424
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,257
and walk out through a subway tunnel
in the middle of Manhattan

425
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,968
at four in the afternoon
while the whole world watches it on TV?

426
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,135
Yes!

427
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,514
-They have a plan.
-What is it?

428
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,433
Respectfully, sir... we don't know.

429
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:51,810
Well, what do they want?

430
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:55,188
Could be a mercenary
who doesn't care about the cause.

431
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:56,773
Cause is money.

432
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,316
Yeah, but, uh, not a lot.

433
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,235
Come on down here, John.

434
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,196
We have a guy
that's got 14 hostages in there,

435
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,200
with two kids being part of that
14 hostages. He's a consummate pro.

436
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,327
And he's planned down to the second,

437
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,705
and he's given us a deadline of 4:13.

438
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:15,166
This guy could ask you for $30 million,
and you'd have to give it to him.

439
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,086
Timing and control
are everything to this man.

440
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,380
-So he's not gonna give it up?
-[Raye and Anthony] No.

441
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:25,010
Yes. Well, the City of New York
does not give in to terrorists.

442
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,512
How about just getting the money,
just as an option?

443
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:31,474
Do your job. We don't want options.

444
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:36,563
[sirens wailing]

445
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:41,192
I got a transit authority supervisor
headed down the tunnel.

446
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:43,028
One of the guys thinks it's his train.

447
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,655
-[Raye] Get him out.
-Yeah, I dispatched a patrol officer.

448
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,283
You mean to tell me
an officer has a radio down there?

449
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:50,577
-[officer] Yeah.
-That's good.

450
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,245
He can be our eyes.

451
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,964
-[beeps]
-[footsteps approaching]

452
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,595
[beeping]

453
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:15,352
[computer beeping]

454
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:20,273
Action.

455
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,114
-Move it, move it, move it. Move it.
-[woman] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

456
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,631
Just back it up, cowboy.

457
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,634
-What the hell do you think you're doing?
-[gun cocks]

458
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:50,428
This is city property
you're fooling around with.

459
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:54,599
Yeah? So's the pigeon poop
on Grant's Tomb.

460
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,143
I'm a line superintendent.
I'm coming on board.

461
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,437
-I warned you, stupid.
-[Caz grunts]

462
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:00,897
[woman gasping]

463
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,774
Oh!

464
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,702
Hey, everybody forward!

465
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,161
Let's go, let's go!

466
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,080
[people screaming]

467
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,708
Everybody forward. Let's go.

468
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,002
What happened?

469
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,170
Hey, I warned the stupid bastard.
He just kept coming.

470
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,259
-Was he alone?
-I didn't see anything.

471
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,261
[Mr. Green]
There's another blip on the screen.

472
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:33,888
-[Mr. Blue] Just one?
-As far as I know, yeah.

473
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,434
Okay.

474
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:39,561
Not unexpected.

475
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:43,773
Stay calm.

476
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,028
-Watch the door.
-I got it.

477
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:51,156
I thought no one was supposed to get hurt.
That's what you said, right?

478
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,616
No one was supposed to get hurt, right?

479
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,412
[sighs]

480
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:59,456
I guess I got us on the scoreboard, huh?

481
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:13,470
[radio clicks]

482
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:14,721
I can't believe it.

483
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,014
They just shot the supervisor.

484
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,891
Is he alive? Can we help him?

485
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:26,816
No.

486
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,819
They just drew first blood.

487
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:33,782
-Uh, your line supervisor.
-Caz Holowitcz?

488
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,160
They shot Caz Holowitcz?

489
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,246
Uh, I don't have positive identification.

490
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,541
They shot Caz Holowitcz. They shot Caz.

491
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,216
Brown...

492
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,803
Listen, you know you can get out
of this anytime, right?

493
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:57,263
You just walk out that door anytime.

494
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,725
-You don't get it.
-I do get it, okay?

495
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:05,271
It's about fear.
You think this makes you bad, huh?

496
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,690
You know this is wrong.

497
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,032
Come on.

498
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,367
Mr. Brown...

499
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,124
I want you to walk over to the other end
and cover that door.

500
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:27,627
I want Mr. Grey over here with me
so I can keep an eye on him.

501
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,256
He loves his guns.

502
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,590
Maybe it was necessary.

503
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,175
I didn't see.

504
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:37,220
He got off on it.

505
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,975
[Anthony over radio]
Come in, Pelham 123.

506
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:43,810
Come in, Pelham 123.

507
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,895
You just shot our line supervisor.

508
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,939
I thought we had an agreement
going here, Blue.

509
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,524
Come in, Pelham 123.

510
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,192
Blue, come in...

511
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:54,279
We told you that's what you get,
didn't we?

512
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:55,905
[sneezes]

513
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,615
But you're too arrogant
and almighty to think...

514
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:58,533
[door opens]

515
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,202
...that anyone could ever crack
the system. Well, somebody did, all right?

516
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,913
-All right? Well, that's what you get.
-[Anthony] Who is this? Hello?

517
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:05,373
-Who is this?
-[door slams]

518
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:08,710
Hello, Pelham 123.
Who is this, Pelham 123?

519
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:09,669
Tell them.

520
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:11,129
We told you to stay away.

521
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,755
Who is this?

522
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:14,507
Who was that guy?

523
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,428
I told you that this wasn't a game.

524
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:23,808
[Anthony]
Hello, Blue. Come in, Blue. Come in--

525
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:32,400
I do the talking. Yes?

526
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,278
Yeah. [sniffs]

527
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,155
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

528
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,451
I just-- I knew the line super.

529
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:43,745
-Did you?
-Yeah.

530
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:46,706
Caz Holowitcz.

531
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,085
Flamboyant jerk.

532
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:52,795
Ran his own old kingdom.

533
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,840
That's what I'm talking about. That's what
I was always running up against.

534
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:01,930
You must... stay relaxed.

535
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,182
I'm relaxed.

536
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:07,560
I mean, I'm not--
You know, I'm... I'm relaxed.

537
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:09,437
[sighs]

538
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,605
You...

539
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:14,525
You are a curious man.

540
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,615
All right, hold it.
People, people, listen up.

541
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:23,159
There's an undercover cop on the train.

542
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:25,745
There were two, street crime unit.
One got off at 33rd Street.

543
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:28,873
Called in later when the news got out.
Partner is still on the train,

544
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,541
-one of the hostages.
-Male or female?

545
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,043
Don't know yet.

546
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,045
-[Raye] What time?
-3:31.

547
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,172
Somebody's got to fix
this digital on here now too.

548
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:37,090
-Hey.
-[man] Yes, sir.

549
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,008
[Anthony]
Fix the digital on this side over here.

550
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,051
[man]
Right away.

551
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,236
What are you people doing here, huh?

552
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,446
-I'm sorry, all right?
-I have got operators calling...

553
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,991
And there's a row of computers
that just went out.

554
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,076
I'm sorry, all right?
We all have problems right now.

555
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,662
Yeah, yeah. We all got problems, huh?
You wanna hear about problems?

556
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,956
How about half a million passengers
trying to get home?

557
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,916
-Stonehouse, I'm sorry.
-I'm gonna tell you something.

558
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,419
I never thought I'd see the day
that talking to a murderer

559
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:16,754
would take priority
over running a railroad!

560
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,217
Pelham 123 to Command Center.

561
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,433
Pelham 123 to Command Center.

562
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,981
[Anthony]
Blue, come in. Yeah, we're here.

563
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,942
You know what we're trying to do
out here, right?

564
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:41,070
You have 40 minutes left.

565
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,156
I don't like this guy.

566
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:48,911
Look, you either gonna deal with me
or you can deal with the tactical team.

567
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,291
My high command
is already getting antsy so...

568
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,419
Please,
I think we can talk this thing through.

569
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,670
It's just me and you.

570
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,464
You asked for us and here we are.

571
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,633
[talks with Italian accent]
Bravo, bravo, Antonio.

572
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,970
You play your part very well.

573
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:08,598
I'm not playing and neither are you.

574
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:11,726
Now, there's one man down already,
but I think we can work this out.

575
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,644
We?

576
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,607
-It will work out.
-[handset beeps]

577
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,900
Blue.

578
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:20,693
Blue?

579
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,990
Now, explain to me this.

580
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,618
These lights are the power boxes.

581
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,454
And these are the ladders to the exits.

582
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:34,040
It's the emergency ones.

583
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,876
-How many blocks are we looking at here?
-Ten blocks.

584
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,880
-Thirty?
-Oh, yeah.

585
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,965
-Thirty exits in a ten-block area.
-Oh, yeah.

586
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,634
Well, that makes sense.

587
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:47,678
-You better get your Plan B ready.
-Why the sudden change?

588
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,014
There's no sudden change.
I'm just playing the odds.

589
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,558
[Shaky breathing heavily]

590
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:53,935
[labored breathing]

591
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:56,396
-Hey. Do you have a medical condition?
-I can't breathe.

592
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,189
-Heart problems?
-I can't--

593
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,690
-Asthma?
-[gasping]

594
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:02,068
Listen, you're okay. Just breathe.

595
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,778
-Three deep breathes. Here you go.
-[Shaky inhales]

596
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:06,114
Are your people in place?

597
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:09,200
I can have three five-man teams
in the subway in two minutes

598
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,494
but it's a gamble.
The hijackers are protected.

599
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,996
We don't know how many
or where they are in the train.

600
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,541
-Go in. Take 'em out.
-[woman] Yes, sir.

601
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,292
[Shaky crying]

602
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:19,669
-Shut!
-[gasps]

603
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,130
Shut up, Shaky.

604
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:24,465
You, sit down now.

605
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,009
-Shut your face.
-[door opens]

606
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:30,221
Everything quiet out here, Mr. Grey?

607
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,143
-[Shaky sobs]
-[Mr. Grey] Everything's fine.

608
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:41,190
[men over radio talking indistinctly]

609
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:44,861
[man over radio]
Stay out of sight.

610
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:48,197
-Repeat, stay out of sight.
-[man] Take cover. Take cover.

611
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,078
[man]
Get in position.

612
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,168
[man]
Lay down.

613
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,882
Hey. Go, go, go. Go.

614
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,805
[beeping]

615
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,934
Look at this. Look at this.

616
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:22,064
-[Mr. Blue] It's just like clockwork.
-Like clockwork?

617
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:25,193
-You better be right.
-Of course I'm right.

618
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:33,242
[sighs] They sure are taking their time.

619
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:36,037
Don't worry.

620
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,499
They'll pay us. They have no choice.

621
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:45,213
They might not just go along with it,
you know. [sniffs]

622
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:49,759
You know, they might say, "Okay,"
and then try to...

623
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:53,137
Well, then a lot of people will die.

624
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:55,640
Including us. [sniffs]

625
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:59,268
-Well, either you live or you die.
-Think I care.

626
00:41:59,352 --> 00:42:02,396
I don't care. Who wants to drive
a subway train the rest of his life?

627
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,235
-What'd they finally nail you for?
-They didn't nail me, I was framed.

628
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:11,989
I was. [sniffs]

629
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:15,243
They had a gang running dope
on the subways,

630
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:18,829
giving it to a train operator,
him giving it to a contact downtown.

631
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,375
They tried to pin it on me.
They didn't have any evidence.

632
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,919
-Hmm. You were innocent.
-Yeah.

633
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,379
[chuckles]

634
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:27,797
Yeah, I was innocent.

635
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,926
I wouldn't do something like that.
You think I'd do something like that?

636
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:36,180
Sniper reports
that there are two other suspects

637
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:41,227
down there with machine guns,
plus whoever else is in the cab with Blue.

638
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:46,482
Excuse me.
There's another voice on this tape.

639
00:42:46,566 --> 00:42:48,818
-Can you cue it up?
-Yeah.

640
00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:52,947
[tape playing in reverse]

641
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,699
-Go ahead, play.
-[man] Okay.

642
00:42:57,118 --> 00:42:59,662
[Mr. Green] ...but you're
too arrogant and almighty to think

643
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:02,331
that anyone could ever crack the system.
Well, somebody did, all right?

644
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:04,875
[sneezing]

645
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:06,168
I told you it's going around.

646
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:09,255
This guy sounds like a train operator.

647
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:10,298
Astoria Boulevard.

648
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:12,717
-Myrtle Avenue.
-Flatbush.

649
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:23,352
Pelham 123 to Command Center.

650
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:29,984
-Anthony here. Go ahead.
-You have 33 minutes left, Anthony.

651
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:33,904
[Anthony]
I'm listening, Blue.

652
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,453
You are to have an armored car
waiting at the northwest corner

653
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:42,663
of the South Ferry subway entrance.

654
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:44,373
Got it.

655
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:48,294
You will have First Avenue cleared
to the Queensboro Bridge.

656
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:51,088
Where are you going?

657
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:56,177
Further instructions to follow. Blue out.

658
00:43:57,928 --> 00:44:01,015
-How about the ransom?
-Under discussion at the mayor's office.

659
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:02,933
-What's taking so long?
-Well, it's not that simple.

660
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:05,645
Try getting a bank to do business
with the City of New York.

661
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:10,024
Get the money cleared as fast as you can.
We might get another shot at them.

662
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:12,401
You would pay,
and go along with this loony scheme

663
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:14,654
of driving an armored car
through the streets of Manhattan?

664
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:16,364
Yes, I would, sir.

665
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:19,283
Listen, I would pay,
I'd get more time with the hostages,

666
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,410
and, look it,
I'd get another shot at these guys,

667
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:24,330
and I might be able to bring
a couple of the bad guys down.

668
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:27,750
-You mean, you'd kill the bad guys?
-That would be the plan, sir.

669
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,044
-Good footage.
-Excellent footage, sir.

670
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:30,961
What about the hostages?

671
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:33,339
Any chance of them
being caught in-- in the middle?

672
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:36,801
-There's no guarantee.
-The snipers don't miss.

673
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:40,221
So maybe we lose one or two,
that's not bad out of eight.

674
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:41,806
As long as it's not a child.

675
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:43,891
No, no, there's 14 hostages, sir.

676
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:47,228
And, yeah, I mean, the mayor would
have won by a landslide but killing a kid,

677
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:51,524
-that would be hard to put a spin on it.
-We're talking about people's lives.

678
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,526
We're talking about the six o'clock news.

Command Center to Pelham 123.

850
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:02,819
The money has arrived.
I repeat, the money has arrived.

851
00:56:02,903 --> 00:56:06,740
-Excuse me. What are you doing?
-They only know what we tell 'em.

852
00:56:07,324 --> 00:56:09,159
Command Center to Pelham 123.

853
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:11,787
Come in, Blue. This is Anthony.
The money has arrived.

854
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,748
I repeat, the money has arrived.

855
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:22,756
You just made it, didn't you?

856
00:56:23,507 --> 00:56:25,842
-Yeah.
-Listen closely.

857
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:33,225
You are to send two
unarmed police officers down the track.

858
00:56:34,101 --> 00:56:36,603
Carrying five million dollars
in small bills, right?

859
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:39,231
They can manage.

860
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:44,444
Now, the children will open the bags
so no dye packs.

861
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:48,031
Got it.

862
00:56:49,408 --> 00:56:50,534
[handset beeps]

863
00:56:56,248 --> 00:56:59,459
[sirens wailing]

864
00:56:59,543 --> 00:57:00,918
[people chattering]

865
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:11,138
All right, make some room.

866
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:12,681
-Come on.
-All right, let's go.

867
00:57:12,764 --> 00:57:14,850
Go, go! Get it down there.

868
00:57:16,393 --> 00:57:19,354
[beeping]

869
00:57:21,857 --> 00:57:23,150
There they are.

870
00:57:27,446 --> 00:57:28,738
It's too soon.

871
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:37,581
[man] Got a report
there's someone in the tunnel.

872
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:43,587
Hold your position.

873
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:46,173
See if you can get them out
without being seen.

874
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:49,050
Idiots.

875
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,764
Okay. How's the light?

876
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:57,309
Come on.

877
00:58:11,156 --> 00:58:12,491
[mimicking gunshots]

878
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:16,745
Pow!

879
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:18,830
[blows]

880
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:28,632
-Hey, hey. Stop.
-[gasps]

881
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:31,551
-Stop. Police. Oh, Jesus!
-[man] Don't shoot!

882
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:33,011
-[gun fires]
-Who's shooting?

883
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:34,387
Look out! Don't shoot!

884
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:35,847
-[glass shatters]
-[people screaming]

885
00:58:36,473 --> 00:58:38,058
[man over radio]
Someone's shooting down there.

886
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:43,021
[people screaming]

887
00:58:48,235 --> 00:58:49,361
[man]
We have shots fired.

888
00:58:50,946 --> 00:58:51,780
[grunts]

889
00:58:53,907 --> 00:58:54,824
[people screaming]

890
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,537
Shut up and be quiet!

891
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:01,915
-What the hell are you doing?
-[Mr. Blue] Shut up.

892
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:04,334
[man over radio]
What's going on down there?

893
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:06,336
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

894
00:59:09,214 --> 00:59:11,633
I don't know who fired first,
but these two TV news guys

895
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:14,594
were right in the middle of it.
They're okay. They weren't hit.

896
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:17,597
[woman]
Excuse me.

897
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:20,267
Excuse me.
I know first aid, I can help her.

898
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,978
-[Mr. Blue] Everybody shut up!
-[Mr. Green] Go on and go up there.

899
00:59:24,104 --> 00:59:26,231
-Where are you shot, huh?
-Over here.

900
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:27,148
Let me see it.

901
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,695
You're gonna be all right, okay?

902
00:59:32,112 --> 00:59:33,113
[Brown gasping]

903
00:59:33,196 --> 00:59:36,366
Okay. This is what I want you to do,
just press on it.

904
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:38,285
-[gasps]
-I know it hurts. I know.

905
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:39,995
[Brown sighs]

906
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:42,080
-A lot of pressure, all right?
-Okay.

907
00:59:42,998 --> 00:59:44,082
Where did you learn that?

908
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:47,377
[chuckles] On the job training, babe.

909
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,962
You're gonna be okay, all right?

910
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:52,549
Lucky for me.

911
01:00:38,053 --> 01:00:39,054
You.

912
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,264
Me?

913
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:47,479
-Stand up, please.
-Hey, Mr. Blue.

914
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,150
This one is like my angel of mercy.
She's saving my life over here.

915
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:55,403
You'll be all right.

916
01:00:57,072 --> 01:00:58,156
Come along.

917
01:01:07,082 --> 01:01:10,460
-What for?
-I need your help. Come on.

918
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,172
Lucky bitch. You're getting out of here.

919
01:01:15,215 --> 01:01:16,966
[door opens]

920
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,697
What I need you to do is I need you
to go down about a hundred feet.

921
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,493
Just wait for the men
delivering the money.

922
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:53,253
Be careful stepping off the train.

923
01:01:58,466 --> 01:01:59,592
Hey.

924
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:04,723
When you see that baby,
you give him a hug for me, okay?

925
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:08,685
-Come on.
-Yeah.

926
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,401
Come on.

927
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:29,789
Should I tell them
that we need a medic?

928
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:32,459
Yeah, sure.

929
01:02:35,587 --> 01:02:36,588
Okay.

930
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:02,864
[gasps]

931
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:23,468
[gunshots]

932
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:40,276
They just shot a hostage.

933
01:04:23,528 --> 01:04:24,654
Get the kids.

934
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:38,918
Why? We're meeting their demands.

935
01:04:39,002 --> 01:04:42,005
-They're getting their money.
-[man] Somebody threw a shot at them.

936
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:43,840
-[Raye] Who?
-Nobody knows.

937
01:04:45,717 --> 01:04:48,094
Command Center to Pelham 123.

938
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:50,221
The money is in the tunnel,
and you shoot somebody?

939
01:04:50,305 --> 01:04:53,975
-That wasn't the deal, Blue.
-You shot one of my people.

940
01:04:54,726 --> 01:04:56,853
I told you what the penalty would be.

941
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:02,358
-[woman 1] What are you doing?
-[kid] Stop!

942
01:05:02,442 --> 01:05:04,360
[woman 2]
Let him go!

943
01:05:04,444 --> 01:05:08,406
[people screaming]

944
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:09,574
No!

945
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,288
-[man] Come on, bring them back.
-Shut up.

946
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:17,373
Why?

947
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:21,044
[people screaming]

948
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:23,463
Come on.

949
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:27,967
Now they've got two boys.

950
01:05:30,887 --> 01:05:32,513
I can't tell what they're doing with them.

951
01:05:32,597 --> 01:05:34,307
They're bringing out two kids.

952
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,351
What are you doing with the kids, Blue?

953
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:38,311
Two boys have been moved
to the back of the train.

954
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:40,063
-I'm going in with tear gas.
-Wait.

955
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:41,981
Why wait? They just killed a hostage.

956
01:05:42,065 --> 01:05:44,525
-He's on it.
-What are you doing with the kids, Blue?

957
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:48,738
Whatever I do with the boys,
you can't stop me, can you?

958
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:50,865
No, Blue, you're in charge.

959
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:53,201
Well, I'm here. You're there.

960
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:55,078
And everything is going
according to your plan,

961
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:56,913
so there's no problem, right?

962
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,665
The money is in the tunnel.

963
01:05:58,748 --> 01:06:00,583
I guarantee you that.
My men are down there,

964
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:03,753
and if you'll just give 'em a minute,
they'll walk it to you.

965
01:06:16,808 --> 01:06:18,726
-[Mr. Green] Lights in the tunnel.
-Lights!

966
01:06:19,644 --> 01:06:21,938
Just stay seated, people.

967
01:06:38,121 --> 01:06:39,706
Okay, close enough.

968
01:06:43,251 --> 01:06:45,044
Toss the bags up on the train.

969
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:57,390
Okay, gentlemen, turn around.

970
01:06:57,974 --> 01:06:59,100
Go home.

971
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:07,400
Boys, look at me.

972
01:07:07,483 --> 01:07:09,736
Drag the money right here.

973
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:21,247
Dump it out on the floor.

974
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:25,501
Oh!

975
01:07:26,294 --> 01:07:27,462
Wow.

976
01:07:31,883 --> 01:07:34,218
You boys ever see $5 million before?

977
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:49,484
Mr. Green...

978
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:50,735
[Mr. Grey chuckles]

979
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:52,445
Time to take care of business.

980
01:07:56,532 --> 01:07:58,409
Give us a hand, Mr. Green.

981
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:01,287
[chuckles] Whoo!

982
01:08:19,972 --> 01:08:22,433
[man over radio]
No one makes a move. Pull back.

983
01:08:24,477 --> 01:08:26,729
Here's the complete list
of all the MTA employees

984
01:08:26,813 --> 01:08:30,483
who were let go under bad circumstances
in the last ten years.

985
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:33,694
-How many?
-In total 63.

986
01:08:33,778 --> 01:08:36,280
But half are either dead
or in the loony bin.

987
01:08:36,364 --> 01:08:38,491
Uh, I can help narrow it down for you.

988
01:08:38,574 --> 01:08:40,201
-Okay.
-Okay.

989
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:42,328
[Mr. Blue]
Pelham 123 to Command Center.

990
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:44,705
Quiet, everyone. Suzanne, get on this.

991
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:47,458
[Mr. Blue]
These will be my final instructions.

992
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:49,544
One,
immediately after this conversation,

993
01:08:49,627 --> 01:08:52,338
you are to restore power
to the entire sector.

994
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,422
[Anthony]
Restore power.

995
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,216
Two, clear all local tracks.

996
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:57,718
And by clear,
I mean all signal set to green.

997
01:08:57,802 --> 01:09:00,805
If I see a red light,
let alone get tripped by one,

998
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:02,223
I kill a hostage.

999
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:03,808
Got it.

1000
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:06,227
Three, all south bound
and north bound trains

1001
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,812
are to remain line dead.

1002
01:09:07,895 --> 01:09:10,857
If I see or pass a moving train,

1003
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:13,484
-I kill a hostage.
-Got it.

1004
01:09:13,568 --> 01:09:15,736
Four, at the South Ferry Station,

1005
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,114
I expect the armored car
and all roads clear

1006
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:19,240
to the Marine Air Terminal.

1007
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:21,742
-The plane should be fueled for--
-[Anthony] Tell me where you're going.

1008
01:09:21,826 --> 01:09:23,661
The plane should be fueled
for an international flight,

1009
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:24,954
that's all you need to know.

1010
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:28,207
Five, clear all police personnel
from the tunnel.

1011
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:31,836
If you deviate in any way
from these instructions...

1012
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:33,462
I kill a hostage.

1013
01:09:39,135 --> 01:09:40,928
-Blue out.
-[handset beeps]

1014
01:09:43,181 --> 01:09:46,225
We pull the ESU out of the tunnel
and secure the area around South Ferry.

1015
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:47,810
Let's go, people. On the double.

1016
01:09:53,316 --> 01:09:56,319
[beeping]

1017
01:10:07,205 --> 01:10:08,664
-[man over radio] Pull back.
-Pull back.

1018
01:10:08,748 --> 01:10:10,166
Move it. Move it.

1019
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:17,131
In a moment, the train will start moving.

1020
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:19,842
-[train hums]
-[hostages sigh]

1021
01:10:19,926 --> 01:10:23,012
We expect to release you
in a short while.

1022
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:24,430
[woman sighs]

1023
01:10:24,513 --> 01:10:27,099
But you will continue to do
exactly as we say.

1024
01:10:27,183 --> 01:10:29,101
[knocking on door]

1025
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:36,817
-Very good.
-[Mr. Green sneezes]

1026
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:44,867
[train brakes hissing]

1027
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:46,953
[rumbles]

1028
01:10:57,588 --> 01:10:59,382
-[beeps]
-[woman] Wait, we got a problem here.

1029
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:01,968
He's moving.

1030
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:05,054
We're not prepared for this, man.

1031
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:08,057
Pelham 123. Blue, what are you doing?

1032
01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:15,940
Blue. Blue, come in.
The track isn't clear.

1033
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:18,943
Blue, we're not set up yet.
Why are you moving?

1034
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:21,862
Slight change of plan.

1035
01:11:21,946 --> 01:11:25,074
Well, they're telling me you're gonna
start running into red lights.

1036
01:11:27,243 --> 01:11:29,453
Well, then you better make them green.

1037
01:11:33,749 --> 01:11:38,170
Continuing slow,
about five miles per hour.

1038
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:41,424
They haven't figure anything out.

1039
01:11:41,507 --> 01:11:43,259
-Of course not.
-[lever thuds]

1040
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:46,387
[screeching]

1041
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,681
[train hisses]

1042
01:11:48,764 --> 01:11:50,391
She's stopped again.

1043
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:59,525
[shatters]

1044
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:31,223
-Coming.
-Tighten that up.

1045
01:12:35,644 --> 01:12:38,189
Sixty seconds, Mr. Green.

1046
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:43,110
All right, Mr. Green?

1047
01:12:44,779 --> 01:12:45,780
Ready to roll, yeah.

1048
01:12:45,863 --> 01:12:48,074
[Anthony] Command Center
to Pelham 123. Come in.

1049
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:58,542
Are all tracks clear
and signals set to green?

1050
01:12:58,626 --> 01:13:00,044
What's going on, Blue?

1051
01:13:01,337 --> 01:13:05,591
Are all tracks clear
and signals set to green?

1052
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:12,932
-All clear.
-Yes.

1053
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,854
You're a real gent.

1054
01:13:19,563 --> 01:13:21,440
Over and out.

1055
01:13:22,316 --> 01:13:24,568
Hello. Hello?

1056
01:13:31,117 --> 01:13:32,618
He's broke the connection. He's gone.

1057
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:33,869
He broke the connection here.

1058
01:13:47,383 --> 01:13:48,467
[sniffs]

1059
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,565
What are you lookin' at?

1060
01:14:03,357 --> 01:14:04,733
[laughs]

1061
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:06,235
Ladies and gentlemen...

1062
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:12,533
I am going out on the tracks
but I will have my eye on you.

1063
01:14:13,242 --> 01:14:14,910
You've been very helpful.

1064
01:14:16,245 --> 01:14:18,497
I want you to continue to be that way.

1065
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:23,794
Thank you.

1066
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:42,146
Ready?

1067
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:49,236
[train rumbles]

1068
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:51,864
He's moving.

1069
01:14:59,413 --> 01:15:00,498
Let's go. Move out.

1070
01:15:08,172 --> 01:15:10,257
Hey, hey. You better sit down.

1071
01:15:12,301 --> 01:15:13,385
Hey. Hold on. Hold on.

1072
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:15,638
I'm a police officer.

1073
01:15:16,889 --> 01:15:18,557
-What?
-[woman] She's a cop?

1074
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:21,393
[grunts]

1075
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:24,188
Oh, my leg.

1076
01:15:25,898 --> 01:15:26,899
I think I heard someone.

1077
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:33,656
-[Mr. Blue] Mr. Green. Mr. Green!
-I think I heard someone.

1078
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:38,911
What if they're not on the train?

1079
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:41,080
-That could never happen.
-What if they set the throttle

1080
01:15:41,163 --> 01:15:44,416
-and jumped off the train?
-Hey, move the Pelham line, please.

1081
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:48,045
There's a little gizmo
called a dead man's feature.

1082
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:49,713
It's build right
into the controller's handle,

1083
01:15:49,797 --> 01:15:51,257
in case the operator drops dead.

1084
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,342
Somebody's hand
is always gotta be on that thing

1085
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:55,427
or the train stops cold.

1086
01:15:56,262 --> 01:15:57,471
It's low tech but it works.

1087
01:15:58,389 --> 01:16:00,724
-Where are they taking us now?
-Don't worry, don't worry.

1088
01:16:00,808 --> 01:16:02,434
They'll gonna let us go pretty soon.

1089
01:16:02,518 --> 01:16:04,478
Can't anybody count?
All four of them got off!

1090
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:06,605
-There's nobody's driving the train!
-[people screaming]

1091
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:17,575
[Mr. Blue] We do it by the numbers
just as we planned.

1092
01:16:17,658 --> 01:16:19,451
-[Mr. Green coughs]
-[Mr. Blue] First...

1093
01:16:20,244 --> 01:16:21,245
Coats.

1094
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:29,628
Check the load in your handguns.

1095
01:16:29,712 --> 01:16:31,338
[guns clicking]

1096
01:16:38,554 --> 01:16:39,972
We're not stopping. We're gonna be killed.

1097
01:16:40,055 --> 01:16:42,182
[train rumbling]

1098
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:45,644
[Mr. Blue] Next, release the magazine
from your automatic weapon.

1099
01:16:47,855 --> 01:16:49,106
[Mr. Green coughing]

1100
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:50,441
Switch coats.

1101
01:16:54,236 --> 01:16:56,780
Have you released the magazine
from your automatic weapon, Mr. Grey?

1102
01:16:56,864 --> 01:16:59,199
Are you serious, man?
Can you hurry up, please?

1103
01:16:59,283 --> 01:17:03,287
Mr. Grey, release the magazine
from your automatic weapon.

1104
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,414
-Watch me.
-Do what he says so we can get

1105
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:08,208
-the hell out of here, will you?
-Why don't you shut your face?

1106
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:10,419
-Do it.
-[kissing]

1107
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:11,962
So long, folks.

1108
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,006
Bunch of losers.

1109
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:17,217
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

1110
01:17:22,723 --> 01:17:23,849
Let's go.

1111
01:17:24,642 --> 01:17:27,436
Let's go! Get his money, Mr. Green.

1112
01:17:32,274 --> 01:17:36,487
I've been going over his plan
and how it's tied into that sudden move.

1113
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:39,448
-[sighs] The train moved, it stopped.
-Why?

1114
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:42,618
-Because the police in the tunnel--
-That's what he said.

1115
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:43,702
And you don't believe him?

1116
01:17:43,786 --> 01:17:46,955
Suppose he was trying to do something
that he didn't want anybody else to see.

1117
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:49,291
-Like what?
-Like getting off the train.

1118
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:52,211
-The train is moving. They can't do it!
-He beat it.

1119
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:54,922
-The dead man's feature.
-He beat it. He beat it. He beat it!

1120
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:57,174
-He beat the dead man's feature!
-The dead man's feature.

1121
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,430
-We will stop.
-How do you know?

1122
01:18:03,514 --> 01:18:04,890
But I do know.

1123
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:08,602
I've been riding on this subway cars
for over 60 years.

1124
01:18:08,686 --> 01:18:10,270
-I'm an expert.
-[woman crying]

1125
01:18:10,354 --> 01:18:14,441
They got these things called stoppers
or stickers, or something like that.

1126
01:18:14,525 --> 01:18:18,696
So whenever a train goes through
a red light, it automatically stops it.

1127
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,788
-Cool, except for one thing.
-What's that?

1128
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:29,456
They're all green.

1129

[men chattering]

1132
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:48,308
[Mr. Green]
Come on. Let's get the hell out of here.

1133
01:18:51,687 --> 01:18:54,440
-[gun clicks]
-[Mr. Green] Let's just go.

1134
01:18:54,523 --> 01:18:57,860
-[Anthony] Keep the change, all right?
-[man] Hey, taxi.

1135

[sniffs]

1136
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,573
[Mr. Brown]
Come on. Hurry up.

1139
01:19:15,419 --> 01:19:17,838
-Call for back up.
-Don't go down there.

1140
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:19,590
Stop the train.

1141
01:19:26,013 --> 01:19:28,223

[people chattering indistinctly]

1145
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:50,204
Leave her.

1146
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:52,956
Leave her. Traffic's bad.
We'll meet where we said.

1147
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:55,167
Go, Mr. Green. Go!

1148
01:20:38,085 --> 01:20:40,629

[grunts]

1150
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:03,777
You were on the train.

1151
01:21:05,362 --> 01:21:06,697
Are you a cop?

1152
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:12,119
Well done.

1153
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:15,873
The mayor will come to your funeral.

[gun fires]

1156
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:25,716
Put it down!

1157
01:21:25,799 --> 01:21:27,342
No way.

1158
01:21:28,302 --> 01:21:29,553
Come on.

1159
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:31,847
Do the honorable thing.

1160
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:34,182
Put it down. This is over.

1161
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:37,227
Honor amongst thieves.

1162
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:41,899
Could you use half a million dollars?

1163
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,945
My ex-wife would love it.

1164
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:50,240
I just don't like the odds.

1165
01:21:51,575 --> 01:21:53,827
There's a whole platoon coming down here.

1166
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:57,998
Just put it down, man.

1167
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:14,681
[Mr. Blue grunts]

1168
01:22:18,936 --> 01:22:21,438
Tell me something, Anthony.

1169
01:22:24,983 --> 01:22:27,361
They still execute in this state?

1170
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:31,031
No, Mr. Blue, they don't.

1171
01:22:37,412 --> 01:22:38,830
[electricity sizzles]

1172
01:22:45,921 --> 01:22:47,547

You did real good, ma'am.

[beeps]

1175
01:23:01,812 --> 01:23:04,231
Reset the signals.
Everything on the line goes red.

1176
01:23:04,314 --> 01:23:06,817
When it hits the loop at South Ferry
he'll be doing 70.

1177
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,944
[Frank] We gonna stop him
before he hits the loop.

[people cheering]

1188
01:23:43,687 --> 01:23:45,647
How many guys left on the MTA list?

1189
01:23:45,731 --> 01:23:48,066
-Eight or nine.
-Let's go.

1190
01:23:54,114 --> 01:23:55,407
[man]
Who's there?

1191
01:23:56,116 --> 01:23:59,286
New York City Police.
Can we speak to you for just a second?

1192
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:04,791
What can I do for you?

1193
01:24:09,046 --> 01:24:10,255
Sorry to have bothered you.

1194
01:24:11,006 --> 01:24:12,049
[Raye]
Good evening.

1195
01:24:33,445 --> 01:24:35,280
Aah!

1196
01:24:36,823 --> 01:24:39,076
[laughing]

1197
01:24:53,715 --> 01:24:56,468
-Langman.
-Four.

1198
01:25:00,055 --> 01:25:02,057
[laughs]

1199
01:25:05,102 --> 01:25:06,645
[knock on door]

1200
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:08,146
Yeah?

1201
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,941
New York City Police Department,
can we talk to you for a second?

1202
01:25:16,321 --> 01:25:17,572
Just a minute.

1203
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:24,996
[sighs]

1204
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,415
-How many more of this we got?
-Five.

1205
01:25:27,499 --> 01:25:29,167
I'm in the, uh... I'm in the toilet.

1206
01:25:31,044 --> 01:25:32,295
Just a minute.

1207
01:25:46,184 --> 01:25:47,894
Hold on. I'll be right there.

1208
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:51,523
Coming.

1209
01:25:55,735 --> 01:25:57,070
[gasps]

1210
01:25:57,154 --> 01:25:58,071
Um...

1211
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,451
-[knocking on door]
-Yeah.

1212
01:26:13,879 --> 01:26:15,922
-Hubert Langman?
-Yeah.

1213
01:26:16,006 --> 01:26:19,384
Hi, I'm Detective Raye.
This is Detective Prescotti.

1214
01:26:19,467 --> 01:26:22,554
-Can we ask you a couple of questions?
-I'm sorry, what?

1215
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:24,681
It will just take a couple of minutes.

1216
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:27,475
-Can we come in?
-Yeah.

1217
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,061
Thank you.

1218
01:26:41,156 --> 01:26:42,741
Where were you this afternoon?

1219
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:45,035
Oh, um, here.

1220
01:26:46,995 --> 01:26:49,623
-Do you work?
-Yeah. Yeah, I work.

1221
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:51,041
What do you do?

1222
01:26:51,124 --> 01:26:55,128
In New Jersey,
I, uh, work for a private bus company.

1223
01:26:55,212 --> 01:26:56,713
School buses?

1224
01:26:56,796 --> 01:26:59,424
Minivans. I take seniors to the mall.

1225
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:03,136
-You take seniors to the mall?
-Yeah.

1226
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:04,262
It's nice.

1227
01:27:04,888 --> 01:27:08,308
Is this a job that you got after
you were fired from the transit authority?

1228
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:11,978
What does that have to do with anything?

1229
01:27:12,062 --> 01:27:15,649
Oh, there was a big hijacking today
at the subway.

1230
01:27:17,108 --> 01:27:18,318
[chuckles]

1231
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:20,487
Are you kidding?

1232
01:27:21,947 --> 01:27:23,490
[chuckles] No.

1233
01:27:25,575 --> 01:27:27,327
You know anything about that?

1234
01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:28,995
No.

1235
01:27:31,873 --> 01:27:35,043
Well, the record shows
that you were really angry.

1236
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:39,631
Angry enough to,
uh, get back at someone?

1237
01:27:40,215 --> 01:27:43,009
Oh, sure, you know. Yeah, I was angry.
[chuckles nervously]

1238
01:27:44,552 --> 01:27:47,305
Um, but I left that behind.

1239
01:27:52,519 --> 01:27:56,356
Got anybody that can vouch
for your being here all afternoon?

1240
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,316
Yeah, my, uh, my cat.

1241
01:27:59,651 --> 01:28:02,779
-Cat?
-Yeah, I was... I was here sleeping.

1242
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:03,905
[sniffs]

1243
01:28:09,411 --> 01:28:12,163
Smells good. What you cooking?

1244
01:28:12,247 --> 01:28:17,711
Excuse me. Don't you need, uh, a warrant
to go, uh, poking around in people's pots?

1245
01:28:17,794 --> 01:28:20,171
You just need to be incredibly hungry.

1246
01:28:20,255 --> 01:28:21,464
[snorts]

1247
01:28:21,548 --> 01:28:24,175
Yeah, I know I have a gripe
with the transit authority

1248
01:28:24,259 --> 01:28:26,511
but that's ancient history, you know.

1249
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:28,805
I-- You don't have a right to be here.

1250
01:28:30,807 --> 01:28:34,352
Well, listen, I'll get in touch with you
when I need more information.

1251
01:28:34,436 --> 01:28:36,187
Make sure you stay in the city.

1252
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:38,648
[Raye]
Thank you, Mr. Langman.

1253
01:28:38,732 --> 01:28:40,233
You know what, this is my home,

1254
01:28:40,317 --> 01:28:42,777
you know, and I think
I have a right to privacy here.

1255
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:46,197
So... Yeah, go!
And get the hell out.

1256
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:48,742
Sorry if we bothered you.

1257
01:28:52,287 --> 01:28:53,455
[sneezes]

1258
01:28:53,872 --> 01:28:54,914
[Anthony]
Bless you.

1259
01:28:54,998 --> 01:28:58,460
-[Raye] I told you it's going around.
-[door clicking and opening]
