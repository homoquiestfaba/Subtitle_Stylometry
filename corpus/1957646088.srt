1
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,847
Good to see ya, Boss.

2
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:54,729
Back in this fuckin' place.

3
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:58,036
Not much better than my cell.

4
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,300
It's only for a couple days.right?

5
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,127
Yeah...one way or another.

6
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,227
This is the guy?

7
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,099
No. this their lawyer.

8
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:27,718
You do know that I'm convicted
of murder, right?

9
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:31,113
I'm out on bail on a million
and a half dollars.

10
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,333
I have 48 hours to pack up
me and my kid,

11
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,857
and find some non-extraditable
country

12
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,467
with good weather
and cheap drinks,

13
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,165
and you bring me
the wrong fucking guy?

14
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,429
Where's my money, Lloyd?

15
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:43,604
I'm working on it.

16
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,214
You're working on it?

17
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,258
We have a list.

18
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:52,221
People that worked with him.

19
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:53,614
People that might have had
access to the money.

20
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,325
You're sure?

21
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,631
He doesn't know
about anything else?

22
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:25,080
Now we don't have time to do
this thing clean, Lloyd.

23
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:27,604
So you get the guys and
you go down this list

24
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:30,302
and you kill them all.

25
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:31,956
And then you find my money,
understand?

26
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,394
Wives, families,
I don't give a fuck.

27
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,309
Whoever stole one bent
penny from my cash.

28
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:38,485
Will do.

29
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:41,096
Loud and messy, Lloyd.
Loud and messy.

30
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,665
I want to send them a message
they don't fuck with me.

31
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,058
And I want proof that
you did the job.

32
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:52,237
You earn your
respect with this,

33
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,457
and you'll be running
the show from here on out.

34
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,154
You fuck up,

35
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:59,419
and the next guy get a piece
of paper with your name on it.

36
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:13,302
Here, it keeps
real good time.

37
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,001
You got 48 hours.

38
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,105
Get in there!

39
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,369
That's right.

40
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:32,816
Does this look like a guy who
just struck it rich to you?

41
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,776
Me neither.

42
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,563
He does look guilty though.

43
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,826
Somebody gave you money
that doesn't belong to you.

44
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,611
No, no. I swear! I swear.

45
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:45,916
Shut up!

46
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,837
Freddie?

47
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,405
20 grand.

48
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,146
Outta all that money?

49
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,630
Cheap bastard.

50
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,925
Nice to be out of the city.

51
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,492
Out there on the open road.

52
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,543
Here. Why don't you. why don't
you work with this for a minute?

53
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:39,639
I know it's a lot,
all at once, kiddo.

54
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,642
But I think it's
the best thing for you.

55
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,427
I mean look around.

56
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,996
You have all this
space and fresh air.

57
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,345
Plus this will give us
all a chance

58
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,520
to get to know each other.

59
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:57,482
I mean Maggie's fantastic,
you know?

60
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,702
And I'm sure you and Lauren
will get along just fine.

61
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,206
How you holding up?

62
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:29,906
Is there something you
want to talk about?

63
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,473
Please leave me alone.

64
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,390
Lauren, I--
What?

65
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,608
What? Is there anything
that I can say

66
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:37,914
that's going to make us
turn the car around

67
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,089
and go back home?

68
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,702
Honey-- I understand
that this is a--

69
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:44,704
No. You don't understand.

70
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,752
Listen, I'm dealing
with this!

71
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:51,928
Just really don't want
to talk about it.

72
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,670
Please leave me alone.

73
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,477
Welcome home ladies.

74
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,784
Ah, my goodness!

75
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:14,141
Oh my god, look 
at all this space!

76
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,664
Lauren?

77
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:21,583
What do you guys think?

78
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,373
You're out of your
mind it you think

79
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,898
I'm using that
clothesline for laundry.

80
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,483
Lauren, take your
brother upstairs

81
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,963
and help him pick out
a bedroom.

82
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,318
He's not my brother.

83
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:07,629
Come on.

84
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:15,637
They're going to be fine.

85
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,344
There you go.

86
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,433
All yours.
Can you believe it?

87
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,527
You're one
lucky little kid.

88
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:37,702
Knock yourself out.

89
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,136
Mom,

90
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,486
where do you want me to put
the cleaning supplies?

91
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:09,577
Uhh, just set them in
the basement by the sink.

92
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,752
Thank you.

93
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:15,931
In case anything
needs ant fixing.

94
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,933
You got a tiny
handyman in there?

95
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,283
Stick around, you'll
see what your man can do!

96
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,371
I can't wait.

97
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,458
I'm so tired I can't--

98
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,502
No, don't let it go!

99
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,985
I told you.

100
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,031
Oh come on, where's
your can-do spirit?

101
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,249
Look, she's right.

102
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,381
Look you've messed up
your arm.

103
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:17,079
Come on, let's do
this another time.

104
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,908
Yeah? All right.
Come on, honey.

105
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,589
Ready, one,
two, three, pull.

106
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,288
This is so stupid guys,

107
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,116
this isn't going to work.

108
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:58,381
Heh.

109
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:02,472
Hey sweetie, remember that
weekend at the cabin?

110
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,868
Hardwood floor, cheap wine,
no mattress.

111
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,003
Leave it.

112
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,093
You guys are so gross.

113
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:17,139
Sweetheart,
you are going to have

114
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,533
a completely different
idea of gross

115
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,230
when you get
to be our age.

116
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,406
Where's Owen?

117
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,585
You're suppose to watch him.

118
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,021
I was helping you move
the mattress!

119
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,807
Lauren, he's your brother now.

120
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,201
Responsibility.

121
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:37,072
Come on, help me find him.

122
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,031
Don't worry about it. 
We'll figure it out.

123
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:50,085
Ow.

124
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,451
Owen?

125
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:56,195
Owen, are down here?

126
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:17,259
Owen?

127
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,015
Owen?

128
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,121
Owen?

129
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:16,144
Hey, ding dong!

130
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,498
What do I look
like to you?

131
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:28,112
Do I look like your
babysitter? Cuz I'm not.

132
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:33,117
My mom may have signed on for
this bullshit, but I didn't.

133
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,946
If you want it so bad,
just take it.

134
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:50,570
Does this whole spooky silent
thing really work for you?

135
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,114
Come on!

136
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,698
We all good?

137
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:33,221
Let's get this done.

138
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,266
Se we can get home before our
beds get cold, yeah?

139
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,357
Hey Bigs, I'm gonna
need receipts

140
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,620
for the shells and the food.

141
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,796
Seriously?

142
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,928
Oh shit, no I got 'em.

143
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:47,104
Hey!

144
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:48,410
Guys...

145
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:50,325
Road trip rules, all right?

146
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,240
You need to make a call
you go through me.

147
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,200
Hey Elvis,

148
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:57,985
What's up with the glasses?

149
00:22:58,028 --> 00:22:59,813
Is that what
you're going with?

150
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:01,249
For real?

151
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:15,437
Oh don't.

152
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:16,699
Don't what?

153
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,921
I can see you getting
all sentimental.

154
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,013
It's a big deal for me.

155
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:32,454
Us all being together
like a family.

156
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:35,762
Having Owen home again.

157
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:37,372
It's a big deal
for all of us.

158
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,680
I mean look at you, you're
climbing the wall right now.

159
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:43,900
Well it's not like I really
have anything else to do.

160
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:47,469
I've been thinking
about that.

161
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,950
this can't be easy for you.

162
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:53,693
And I think you
deserve a reward.

163
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:56,783
Bill, I thought we decided
we were gonna wait.

164
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,306
Fine.

165
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,395
I've been thinking about this.

166
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,312
You're 17 now,

167
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:08,011
and I'm sure a lot of the other
kids around here have one so,

168
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:10,536
say when we finish
tomorrow with the truck,

169
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,233
I take you up
the road to that place

170
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:17,281
and maybe we find you
a nice decent car.

171
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,500
Seriously?

172
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,546
Seriously.

173
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:21,721
I mean living way out here

174
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:23,505
you're going to need
transportation.

175
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,507
plus it'll really be 
a big help with Owen.

176
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,205
[ banging on the door ]

177
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:37,737
Why don't you take you brother
and get him ready for bed?

178
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,827
Bill?Mom, what's going on?

179
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,524
You heard him.
Take Owen upstairs.

180
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,401
Come on twerp, let's get you
in your PJ's.

181
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,418
Is everything okay?

182
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,689
Kay the realtor brought
us some brownies.

183
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:18,604
She said she's going
to come by tomorrow

184
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:22,346
with some groceries from town
to get us started.

185
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,218
Oh.

186
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:29,136
I guarantee it's going
to get easier.

187
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:47,023
Wow, leaving already?

188
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:55,554
You wanna talk about it?

189
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,425
No.

190
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,477
Can I ask you aquestion?

191
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:11,091
Sure.

192
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:12,962
Is this what you
want for yourself?

193
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,400
Is this what you want for me?

194
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:24,278
I know that it's a lot
for you to process.

195
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:27,934
Us moving across town
is a lot to process.

196
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:30,458
You getting married to a
man you don't even know,

197
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:31,459
is a lot for
me to process.

198
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:32,808
But me coming
home from school

199
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:35,506
and finding all
my stuff in boxes--

200
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,639
It's kind of complicated,Lauren!

201
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:44,254
So why don't you explain
it to me then?

202
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:46,692
Jesus, Lauren.

203
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:49,477
Six months ago
I was a waitress.

204
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,654
My life was a dead end
until I met Bill.

205
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,527
I mean,

206
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:59,574
you know, life doesn't give
you a lot of chances,

207
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,533
but when it does
you have to grab them.

208
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:06,189
I just wanna go home.

209
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:09,453
Well this is your home.
Yes, it could be.

210
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:14,502
Lauren...

211
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:19,594
Hey, how 'bout just give
it to night, huh?

212
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,857
and tomorrow morning
it's a new day,

213
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,903
so fun, in our new house.

214
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,169
Please, sweetie.

215
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:41,137
Owen, it's me.

216
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,102
Ready for bed?

217
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:01,810
You're still gonna make with
the silent treatment buddy?

218
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:03,682
Look, I know
it's not easy for you

219
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,728
making the transition
from that structure

220
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,557
to all this freedom,

221
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,472
a new place,
Maggie, Lauren.

222
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:12,995
I mean, I know
it's gotta be tough.

223
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,565
How are two getting along?

224
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,877
Cut her some slack, okay?

225
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,402
None of this is easy
for her either.

226
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:31,535
Come on hoss, time
for the pills. Sit up.

227
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,368
Look uh--

228
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:41,720
I'm rally proud
of you buddy.

229
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:42,764
You're really doing it.

230
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,635
I mean, I knew you could.

231
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:45,636
and I've been telling
them for years

232
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,161
but they don't listen.

233
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:51,512
You keep up the good behavior,
sky's the limit.

234
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,821
Okay, we'll turn
on the internet,

235
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:57,300
and before we know it

236
00:28:57,344 --> 00:29:00,608
I'll have you shopping down
at the car lot. Sounds good?

237
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:05,744
I love you.

238
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:10,618
Sleep tight.

239
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:43,684
What the fuck are you
doing back here?

240
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:44,772
If bill knew you were
up he'd shit himself.

241
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:46,730
Get the fuck up to bed.

242
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:56,218
Hold up. You got a tag.

243
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,238
Something smells good.

244
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:00,413
We're getting there.

245
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:14,775
Hey Hon, did you find the rest
of the kitchen boxes yet?

246
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:16,124
What?

247
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:17,517
We're going to be eating
with our hands again

248
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,171
if you don't
find those boxes.

249
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:21,260
[ knocking on the door ]

250
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,395
I think the realtor
lady's here again.

251
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,875
Huh?

252
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:29,355
Just...

253
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:58,384
[ screaming ]

254
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,867
What do you want?

255
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,480
No!

256
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,134
No!

257
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,231
Maggie!

258
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,885
[ screaming ]

259
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,191
No!

260
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:26,151
Wait, wait.

261
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:27,369
Money!

262
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:28,370
Bill!

263
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:29,763
Please , don't...

264
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:31,591
Babe?

265
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:37,553
Wait, wait, wait! 
You've got the wrong people.

266
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,955
No!

267
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:50,523
Mom?

268
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,005
Mom?

269
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,924
No!

270
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:05,015
No, no, no!

271
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,582
Do I Bill?

272
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,022
Get up!

273
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,796
No! No!

274
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,843
Fucker...Sit down!

275
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,172
Get the kids.

276
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,434
Get rid of the body.

277
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,612
Six months, fuck!

278
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,069
Sit the fuck down.

279
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,558
What did you do with
Mr. Bellavance's money?

280
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:17,382
Listen, we just moved here.

281
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:19,427
I don't know anything
about any money.

282
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:26,826
Neither did this guy.

283
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,875
Or this guy.

284
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,662
and this bitch
didn't know

285
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:41,319
anything about Mr. Bellavance's
money either.

286
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,713
I found this.

287
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,074
Hello in there.

288
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:08,014
Owen?

289
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:09,102
Owen? Owen?

290
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,587
Open the door.

291
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,675
Please open the--

292
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,375
Hi.

293
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,992
Oh no, looks like you
got a boo boo.

294
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:40,133
Owen, help!

295
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:30,531
Aaaaah!

296
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,707
Ah! Ah! Come on,
you don't understand.

297
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,404
Okay, my son is sick.

298
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:35,536
He was in the hospital--

299
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,407
Oh no, I get it!

300
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:39,409
Boss gets locked up
you see your shot.

301
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:40,802
It's a secret account, right?

302
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,848
I mean who's going to come
look for it but him.

303
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:43,979
Look, I didn't,
I didn't mean--

304
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:46,155
No you didn't mean
to get caught.

305
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,332
You didn't mean for
Mr. Bellavance to get out.

306
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:51,857
You certainly didn't mean for us
to come knocking.

307
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,773
What would you do for your son
motherfucker?

308
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:58,124
Owen, please.

309
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,169
Ahhhh!

310
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:26,544
Fuuuuuuck!

311
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:31,461
Stay with him.

312
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:51,481
It's those fucking kids.

313
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:58,924
Watch out
for the blades.

314
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:05,583
Get yourself cleaned up.

315
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:11,110
What's this? Ammo boo club?

316
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:19,379
No!

317
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:26,429
Fuck!

318
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:30,520
Think they're
gonna run?

319
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:34,002
Gonna run,
but they won't get far.

320
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:35,525
One piece of business first.

321
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:37,527
Wait.

322
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:38,616
Wait.

323
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:46,667
Outside in the truck
there's a filing cabinet.

324
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:48,626
The money's inside.

325
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:51,280
and I can open it up
and just--

326
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:57,243
Please, please leave
my kids out of this.

327
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:58,374
Bill,

328
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:04,424
If we go out to that truck,

329
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:08,950
and there's not a cabinet
filled with cash,

330
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:10,996
it's not going to
be too late, paly.

331
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:13,607
Not to find those kids,

332
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,306
and make them see everything
that we're gonna do to you.

333
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:20,266
So?

334
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:25,880
Are you lying to me, Bill?

335
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:31,233
Owen, we have to go!

336
00:44:31,277 --> 00:44:32,582
Owen, come on.

337
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:42,984
Shit.

338
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,212
Shit, shit, shit.

339
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:59,740
Let's go!

340
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,699
Come on!

341
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:14,624
Open it up.

342
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:26,593
Come on. come on.

343
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:33,905
Open 'em.

344
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:35,167
Shit.

345
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,908
Come on, open 'em.

346
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,785
Here we go, ready?Go, go, go, go.

347
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,655
Little sting.

348
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:49,181
Fuck! Ah!

349
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:50,312
Fuck!

350
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:54,403
Come on. Get in there!

351
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:58,625
Yeah, I saw a box
that said medical.

352
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:05,414
Here it is.

353
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,808
I think I'm gonna puke.

354
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:09,331
You're not gonna puke.

355
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,419
How the fuck do you know?

356
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,210
Oh shit.

357
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,610
You have 60 seconds
to open it up.

358
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:26,582
Aw, come on!

359
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,380
What the fuck you doing?

360
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:45,819
Bill.

361
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,561
You should've
left us alone.

362
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:49,779
Drop it.

363
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,702
You knew you took
that money,

364
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,922
someone was gonna
