1
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,168
You see, I'm supposed
to want to do this.

2
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:42,603
And I don't.

3
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,508
I don't want,

4
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,511
nor do I feel good about doing
it.

5
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:54,749
So it's just, it feels weird
to...

6
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,156
I'm just trying to tell
you the truth here, you know.

7
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,124
It doesn't.

8
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,727
I don't have anything to sing.

9
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,696
Amazing grace.

10
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,586
Hey, Tommy, let's
come in here and listen.

11
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:34,728
Hey Tommy.

12
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:38,966
Hey.

13
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,396
You dig?

14
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,332
It's good.

15
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,002
Everything you do is good,
Tommy.

16
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,206
But it's not going on the
record.

17
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,111
Why?

18
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,417
It's too intimate to...

19
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,388
Fuck it, you know what, I don't
like it.

20
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,463
I don't believe you.

21
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,832
I think you love it.

22
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,469
I don't.

23
00:12:48,503 --> 00:12:49,370
Sorry.

24
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,407
I think you love it.

25
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,276
Just like you love me.

26
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,478
And I think you wanna hate it.

27
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,981
'Cause I don't love you.

28
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,387
And you wanna hate it
cause it's not yours.

29
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,790
And that's just too fucking bad.

30
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,063
Well, actually it is mine.

31
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,435
I own every song that
you sing, you know that.

32
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,938
You're gonna go back to Capital
and you are gonna record

33
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,975
the songs that you said
you were gonna record.

34
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,944
And you're gonna do them as
they are demoed and charted.

35
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,479
And you're gonna do 'em on a
schedule

36
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:35,115
and you're gonna do the
physical and the photo shoot

37
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,052
and the fucking interview
and every thing that you hate

38
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,354
because that's what you
signed up for, okay.

39
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:42,990
You're okay.

40
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:44,825
Nah.

41
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:50,898
You nervous?

42
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,333
Hell yeah, I'm nervous.

43
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,337
Is she in there yet?

44
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,238
I don't fucking know,
sometimes she just seems

45
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,541
to disappear.

46
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,975
I don't even know when
she comes into the room.

47
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,898
Listen, assholes.

48
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,367
She can handle it.

49
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,301
She always has.

50
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,570
What are you talking about?

51
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:30,971
Yeah, you know the reason you're
here,

52
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,473
fucking babysitting her.

53
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,007
You think she don't know?

54
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,409
You think I don't know?

55
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,411
You think the whole studio
doesn't know?

56
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,605
I didn't know which brand you
wanted.

57
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:05,339
So I got you a variety.

58
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:06,508
You sure did.

59
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:15,282
Oh, sorry.

60
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,385
Also got your bunch of
juice to choose from.

61
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:25,092
So where's the vodka?

62
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,668
They called and told me not to...

63
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,035
- Didn't get it.
- Called.

64
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,543
That's okay.

65
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:43,611
It's not your fault.

66
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:44,512
It's okay.

67
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,155
Hey Joel, Connor, come on
out here and talk to me.

68
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,606
What are you guys so worried
about?

69
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,041
You worried about me?

70
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,209
'Cause I'm fine.

71
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:20,615
Tommy, you know, we just
thought that it'd be better

72
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:22,082
to finish the session before...

73
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,150
Sing a song for me.

74
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,488
How about "Strangers in the
Night?"

75
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:28,523
Everybody knows that song.

76
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,324
Yep, let's kick it.

77
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:32,794
Come on.

78
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:36,063
- Tommy come on.
- Please.

79
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,103
Come on.

80
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,304
- All right,
- Sing.

81
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,073
We get your point.

82
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,142
Come on.

83
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,077
Tommy come on.

84
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,311
There's no reason for this.

85
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,649
Look I know you can't sing.

86
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,118
Everybody knows you can't
sing, that's the point.

87
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,021
Because you don't do what I do.

88
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,423
You shouldn't be telling me what
to do.

89
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,125
That was never our intention.

90
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,763
I just need you guys to
understand what you're trying

91
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:09,731
to do to me.

92
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,502
And the only way I can
imagine that happening,

93
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:16,303
is if you do what I do.

94
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:21,709
So please, step up to the mic
and sing

95
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:27,481
because if you don't sing, I
won't sing.

96
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,252
Now, count it off again, Grady.

97
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,353
Just like that.

98
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,791
Please.

99
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,398
Keep going.

100
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:02,784
So we'll just try to get her to
do it...

101
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:04,451
Hey.

102
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:06,888
Where you going?

103
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:07,822
Out.

104
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,825
Tommy.

105
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:17,130
Look I can't control the
tour, you got insurance.

106
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,670
I'll be right back.

107
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:29,677
Fucking insurance.

108
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,279
Yes, fucking insurance.

109
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,548
I mean, could we be any further
away

110
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:35,850
than who we were when
we started doing this?

111
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:38,653
No, actually
we couldn't, you know.

112
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:39,520
Back then I actually loved you,

113
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:41,756
now I can't stand the sight of
you.

114
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:43,457
I'm not talking about all that.

115
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,562
I'm you know, I mean, look at
all this.

116
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:48,328
Oh my God.

117
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,196
Fuck it.

118
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,330
Fuck what?

119
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:51,866
Fuck what?

120
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,333
I mean, you know...

121
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:55,903
What?

122
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:57,905
The business that you're in,
huh?

123
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,040
The business that...

124
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,708
What? You one of those artists,
who's like, you know,

125
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:02,209
"Oh, I just missed the day, man.

126
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,377
I miss the day when we used to
work

127
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,647
in that little studio in my
garage, man.

128
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,415
Remember those days, man, it
was so much better coming up."

129
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,785
I'm so sick of this shit!

130
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,654
Do you really miss those days,
huh?

131
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:15,422
Do you really miss those days?

132
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,256
- Tell me?
- Maybe.

133
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,959
Because I remember a guy named
Dave

134
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:20,662
and you had no problem
throwing his ass out,

135
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,730
cause he couldn't get you
where you wanted to be.

136
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,533
- I know...
- So you are where you are.

137
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,500
Aren't you sweetie?

138
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,703
But I'm not
who I was 20 years ago.

139
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,438
But that's you.

140
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,140
Yeah.

141
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,306
That was your choice.

142
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,742
But you're here.

143
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,744
This is not about me.

144
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:37,945
Why are you making it about you?

145
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:40,347
You are not
who you were 20 years ago.

146
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,381
You are not that Memphis girl.

147
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,249
No, I'm not.

148
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,685
You are where you are.

149
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:47,320
You need to show some
gratitude and stop this shit.

150
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,490
Maybe you're right.

151
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:54,361
Maybe I should, show some
gratitude.

152
00:19:58,432 --> 00:19:59,967
All love and gratitude.

153
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,369
You're right.

154
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,404
All the...

155
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,708
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

156
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,544
What happened, huh?

157
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:10,878
What's going on?

158
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,347
I'm just not in the mood.

159
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,283
Tommy.

160
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,418
- What's going on?
- Just not in the mood.

161
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:19,787
So what do you wanna do?

162
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,488
You wanna go walk downtown,
find those guys you like

163
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,790
to hang with and kill yourself,
huh?

164
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:23,858
- Is that it?
- Kiss my ass.

165
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:24,826
Kiss your ass?

166
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:25,827
- I've been kissing your ass
- Kiss my ass.

167
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,561
- For the past twenty
- You got a lot of nerve

168
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,696
- fucking years.
- Talking to me.

169
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:30,531
I've been kissing your
childish ass...

170
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:31,999
No, no, no, I'm not the only one

171
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,668
- that's been on this ride.
- For twenty fucking years.

172
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:34,334
Fucker.

173
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,402
This is your fucking dream.

174
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:39,674
Whether you wanna realize
it or not, this is it.

175
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:40,908
You did it.

176
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,877
I did it with you.

177
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,879
You're not the victim of the
story.

178
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:45,947
Stop acting like this.

179
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,982
Don't you ever feel any pain?

180
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,383
Oh my God, I am so fucking sick
of you.

181
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,485
I am so fucking sick of you.

182
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,587
I mean, this is so boring.

183
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,888
Don't you get tired of this?

184
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:54,822
- Don't you get tired?
- Do you think I'm sick and tired?

185
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:57,357
Don't you fucking
get tired of this shit?

186
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,626
Don't you?

187
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,465
You fucking do your physical.

188
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,768
You stay the fuck away from me.

189
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,069
- Just go do your goddamn physical.
- Fuck your physical.

190
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:09,070
Okay, well fuck the physical.

191
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,605
- You wanna throw it away?
- Fuck your money.

192
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:11,706
Great. Let's throw it away.

193
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:13,574
- We'll throw it away.
- Oh, walk away.

194
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:14,575
Okay.

195
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:18,411
I'm not finished.

196
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:49,610
Hey Jay.

197
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:50,077
Hey.

198
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:50,778
How's the day?

199
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,814
You know, not that many people,

200
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:54,347
but I think you'll dig it, you
know.

201
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,516
Why don't you come on in?

202
00:21:58,052 --> 00:21:59,821
I'm gonna go get a drink.

203
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:00,888
I won't be long.

204
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:42,630
There's no better
high than being on stage

205
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,364
singing for people.

206
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,875
So when the show is over.

207
00:22:56,143 --> 00:23:00,047
When the lights are out
and people have gone home,

208
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:06,120
the only way to repeat it,

209
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:11,826
is to go for the whiskey,

210
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,132
pill,

211
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,035
smoking.

212
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:57,470
And when I smoke that stuff
and get high and I sing,

213
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,609
hell, I even like the way I
sound.

214
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,681
There's no better place to be.

215
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,522
I'm up there with the angels.

216
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:17,591
I'm up there with God.

217
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:24,598
It's a lonely, beautiful church.

218
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,233
And I'm the preacher.

219
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:12,580
Billy Holiday down in
Washington,

220
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:15,550
Kurt Cobain

221
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:21,989
Sylvia Plath, Chris Cornell,

222
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:27,061
Keith Lee, Graham Parsons,

223
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:32,399
Hank Williams, Amy Winehouse,

224
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:39,840
Tim Buckley, Prince, Ernest
Timmon,

225
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:45,613
Judy Garland, Hunter Thompson,

226
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:49,149
Virginia Woolf,

227
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,220
Jimmy Hendrix,

228
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:56,357
Whitney Houston,

229
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,596
Nick Drake,

230
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:05,232
Elvis Presley,

231
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,203
Tony Scott,

232
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:13,040
Donny Hathaway,

233
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:17,945
Alexander McQueen,

234
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,081
Elliot Smith,

235
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:25,085
Robert Johnson.

236
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:29,423
And they all have one thing in
common.

237
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:33,595
They were creators.

238
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,549
All right.

239
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,317
So Stacey, how was the crush?

240
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,652
She's taking her time
getting back to us,

241
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:06,654
but we'll get it done.

242
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:09,389
So she doesn't wanna do it?

243
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:10,357
Not really.

244
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,425
Why not?

245
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:13,327
Gail?

246
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,294
She doesn't wanna talk about the
girl.

247
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,663
That's what they're
gonna wanna talk about.

248
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:16,497
And to be perfectly honest,

249
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:17,699
I don't know why she needs to do
it.

250
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:20,100
All the dates are booked and
she's pretty much sold out.

251
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,368
So get off her back.

252
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:23,470
She needs to talk about the girl

253
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:24,539
because it's pretty
much taking over

254
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:25,372
the tour and the record.

255
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:27,609
We just need to just put it to
bed.

256
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,777
She's not gonna talk
about it, so that's that.

257
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:33,515
Okay guys, she's also
going on tour to sell records

258
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:37,050
and you don't have a record
to sell and that's a problem.

259
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:38,520
You're such an asshole.

260
00:33:38,553 --> 00:33:39,521
That's enough.

261
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:42,790
Okay, look. Cole, are
we close to finishing?

262
00:33:42,824 --> 00:33:45,259
Well, she's working and
it's really good stuff.

263
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:48,495
And there's no schedule for
that.

264
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,464
Why haven't
I heard anything Cole?

265
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:51,766
She's not ready.

266
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,501
All right.

267
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:57,471
What else?

268
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:00,508
The photo shoot an
interview with Oscar Mitchell.

269
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,109
That's confirmed.

270
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:03,110
That's exciting.

271
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:05,078
Well, it's not exactly
confirmed, confirmed.

272
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:06,480
I mean, she's probably gonna do
it.

273
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:08,382
She really likes Oscar.

274
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:09,349
It's important.

275
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:10,552
No, I know, I know.

276
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:13,555
I know that and as I said, I
think she's gonna do it, so.

277
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:15,489
How do we confirm, I think?

278
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,325
She doesn't really care what you
think

279
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:20,460
and she's probably gonna do it.

280
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,736
Stacey, you
wanna continue please?

281
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,137
Yes.

282
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,040
She doesn't want a new
cover, she wants the one

283
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:35,543
that she picked the same as the
billboard.

284
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:36,511
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

285
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,412
The one where she's
smoking and in real fur?

286
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:40,247
I don't think so.
- That one.

287
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,315
- I think it's really good.
- No.

288
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:41,883
It's great.

289
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:42,584
Inappropriate.

290
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:43,483
It's edgy.

291
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:44,819
Is she gonna show?

292
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:49,256
I don't know what you
want me to tell you, Walker.

293
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,191
You've known her for twenty
years, so...

294
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:53,193
she'll deliver.

295
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,428
She always does.

296
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:55,495
Okay, great.

297
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,531
Thanks so much everyone.

298
00:34:56,564 --> 00:34:58,298
Cole, can you stay behind a sec?

299
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:10,410
I heard you and Tommy put on
quite

300
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,245
a show at Capital.

301
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,181
Whatever.

302
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:16,416
I'm over it.

303
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:18,753
What's that mean?

304
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:20,220
It means I'm over it.

305
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:22,422
It means I'm done.

306
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,490
I don't wanna work with her
again.

307
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:25,593
This is last record, last
tour, last everything.

308
00:35:25,627 --> 00:35:26,894
I'm absolutely done with this.

309
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:29,329
Don't don't even joke
about abandoning her.

310
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,134
She can't take that.

311
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,905
You just finish the record,
okay?

312
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:47,515
I know what she's thinking.

313
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,652
I should find her.

314
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:52,252
I should save her.

315
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:53,554
I should stay with her.

316
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:56,323
I should never let her outta my
sight.

317
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:01,495
She's wondering maybe it's
the girl at the concert

318
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,230
that killed herself.

319
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:08,268
She's wondering maybe it's her
fault.

320
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:11,673
Come on, Walker.

321
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,641
Find it.

322
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:15,442
Come get me.

323
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:17,845
Find me.

324
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:21,849
At least you'll know you tried.

325
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,417
Coffee.

326
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:26,788
Coffee, coffee, that one.

327
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,794
Dude, like she's gonna show.

328
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,428
Pull a fucking gangster dude.

329
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:35,763
Yeah dude, badass.

330
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:37,264
Yeah, totally.

331
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,566
You know, she's fucked up.

332
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:41,234
She's a drug addict, whatever,
who cares?

333
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:41,769
I love her.

334
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:42,770
Yeah.

335
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:44,605
You know my mom finally
divorced my shit bag dad,

336
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,940
'cause of her last song?

337
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:46,708
- Yeah.
- Dude.

338
00:36:58,318 --> 00:36:59,721
Goddamn it.

339
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:01,689
She'll probably be here.

340
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:04,357
Oh you think this is a big
fucking joke?

341
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:05,860
This is all on us, okay.

342
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,429
This is our money, not
yours, not his, not hers.

343
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:10,732
And where's Oscar?

344
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,433
He's ten minutes away.

345
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:16,037
Well, it's pretty clear
that she's not showing up.

346
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,572
It's been two hours.

347
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,709
What?

348
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,678
Don't look at me, it's not my
fault.

349
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:24,612
Whatever.

350
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,982
You and Walker just keep
ignoring the damage.

351
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,918
I have never seen anything like
it.

352
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:38,559
Let me tell you
something... she's over.

353
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,361
Neither one of you guys wanna
admit that.

354
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:44,766
Fuck you, Timothy.

355
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:02,449
Hey, brother man.

356
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:11,959
Hey, Tommy.

357
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,493
Good to see you.

358
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:16,864
So, new record?

359
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:18,699
Tour?

360
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:20,367
What's this, fourteenth?

361
00:38:21,002 --> 00:38:21,936
About that...

362
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,071
You're happy with it?

363
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:25,438
Yeah.

364
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,475
Tell me about it.

365
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:36,684
I think this might
be my last record, man.

366
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:37,819
Why?

367
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:40,988
My heart's given out.

368
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:42,957
Nothing in it anymore.

369
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,028
That's not so good, Tommy.

370
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:50,097
Yeah, I keep looking and
looking.

371
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:51,866
Nothing in there.

372
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,801
Can hardly hear it.

373
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,003
What are you hearing?

374
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,508
Mostly old stuff.

375
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,477
Mama's voice.

376
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:06,881
Santa Boat Creek.

377
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,983
Tony Jo.

378
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:11,886
Funny what we remember, huh?

379
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:12,920
Yeah.

380
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:14,889
What's that you used to sing?

381
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:58,566
Music.

382
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,499
Songs.

383
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:04,605
It's the singer who does
all the work for us.

384
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,808
Yeah?

385
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:09,010
Yeah.

386
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:13,981
People are born and died of
song.

387
00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:16,517
Fall in love, have children.

388
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,786
Find themselves from their loss.

389
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,488
They remember, love and loss.

390
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:26,127
Makes 'em better, stronger
and more vulnerable.

391
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:28,562
All because of song.

392
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:30,998
Damn, man.

393
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:33,601
Sound like a poet.

394
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:34,735
Actually.

395
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:38,739
It's the intro to the interview.

396
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:43,611
Tell me more.

397
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:47,748
Their voices are not theirs.

398
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:49,850
It's given to them to share,

399
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:51,719
to fight from the day they are
born.

400
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,921
They die over and over.

401
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:58,159
They break their own
hearts, so we'll break ours.

402
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:01,963
From the beat of the heart.

403
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:03,998
To the drum to the gray.

404
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:11,505
New song?

405
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,575
Yeah, new song.

406
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,246
I'm gone.

407
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:36,831
See ya.

408
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:25,739
I'm Tommy Gold.

409
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:27,041
I know.

410
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:35,783
I'm Rodney Rod Waters.

411
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:39,019
I wanted to come earlier

412
00:43:39,053 --> 00:43:40,988
and tell you how sorry I was.

413
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,193
I saw her before the show.

414
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:50,931
She was waiting for me.

415
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,140
And then she asked for
autograph and I gave it to her.

416
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:04,411
And then she hugged me
and wouldn't let me go.

417
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:15,089
My daughter was having a tough
time,

418
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:16,924
long before the other night.

419
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:21,362
She loved you.

420
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:25,032
She listened to you sing man all
the time.

421
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,867
Practically day and night.

422
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:30,404
So, nothing but Tommy Gold
around here all the time.

423
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:37,945
I'm just so sorry.

424
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:39,180
Sorry.

425
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,221
So many people
come to me and say,

426
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:30,525
"Your song got me through this
time."

427
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:36,063
"We got married to this song."

428
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,533
"When your baby was born,

429
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:41,201
we played that song
in the birthing room."

430
00:46:43,404 --> 00:46:47,542
I soothe the soul when I sing.

431
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:50,110
Well.

432
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:54,848
A couple years ago, a
little girl killed herself,

433
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:56,317
listening to my music.

434
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,555
I mean, she was listening
to me when she decided...

435
00:47:03,658 --> 00:47:05,392
So I went to see her daddy

436
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,465
and all he could do was
put his arms around me

437
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:15,169
and tell me how much she loved
me.

438
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,371
And thanked me.

439
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,443
Thanking me.

440
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,097
Ah.

441
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:19,667
I know that song.

442
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:23,370
Let's do that.

443
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:24,539
It's cold in here.

444
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:28,409
I'm cold.

445
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,411
One more time, I can't get it
right.

446
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:36,243
One more time.

447
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:37,144
Like shit.

448
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,215
You know what I mean?

449
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:46,721
Right there, you're coming back
on the, yeah, on the chorus.

450
00:49:46,754 --> 00:49:47,622
Yes.

451
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,836
He's been showing up for a
while, but never for this long.

452
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:20,307
Nobody sees him but me.

453
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:25,312
I don't know if he's
the dark or the light.

454
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:27,749
The devil or an angel,

455
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:31,619
Maybe he's the singer's angel.

456
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:25,019
So listen, man.

457
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,855
After tonight I'll hop
on a flight to Memphis.

458
00:56:28,923 --> 00:56:30,524
Need to see some old friends.

459
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:33,094
No problem.

460
00:56:33,127 --> 00:56:34,896
I'll take you to the airport.

461
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:36,864
LAX or Burbank?

462
00:56:36,898 --> 00:56:37,999
I got a car.

463
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,768
You sure?

464
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:43,403
Yeah, you know, I need
to get away for the tour.

465
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:48,876
I love you.

466
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:49,844
I love you.

467
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:53,614
Go get your girl, take a few
days off.

468
00:56:54,782 --> 00:56:55,616
I love you.

469
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,888
How about I just take
you to the airport?

470
00:57:00,922 --> 00:57:01,789
I'm good.

471
00:59:01,075 --> 00:59:02,676
You know, Elvis?

472
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:06,313
Some.

473
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:09,750
You know Hank Williams?

474
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:12,553
Some.

475
00:59:17,258 --> 00:59:19,660
You're the singer's angel.

476
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:22,696
Sometimes.

477
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:45,352
I haven't heard from her.

478
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:47,522
What do you mean?

479
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:52,159
She hasn't returned my calls.

480
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,994
Cool.

481
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:56,263
I went to Stanley and she's not
there.

482
01:04:56,296 --> 01:04:59,199
I haven't heard from her
since she turned in the CD.

483
01:05:01,669 --> 01:05:02,771
This isn't good.

484
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:03,470
I don't get her,
why didn't anybody tell...

485
01:05:03,505 --> 01:05:05,439
She's not returning my calls.

486
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:07,509
Great.

487
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:11,579
Find her, Cole.

488
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:19,119
Great.

489
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:28,429
We gonna put
that on a fucking T-shirt?

490
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:36,270
You guys are so naive.

491
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:36,970
I swear to...

492
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:38,472
Wait, wait, what does that mean?

493
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,009
Well, if you're not worried
about her,

494
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,977
then why do we even have to talk
about it?

495
01:05:44,011 --> 01:05:45,078
Well, we are worried about her.

496
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:46,346
Where do you think she
went on a fucking vacation?

497
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,047
I don't know.

498
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,982
Tell us where you think she is.

499
01:05:49,016 --> 01:05:50,451
It doesn't matter where she is.

500
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:53,420
Wherever she is, she's in
trouble.

501
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:56,990
If she is even hearing...

502
01:05:57,024 --> 01:05:59,193
- What the fuck?
- What does that mean?

503
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:05,365
Hey, could you
tell Tommy I'm here?

504
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:06,366
I can't get her on the phone.

505
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,434
I can't get her anywhere.

506
01:06:07,468 --> 01:06:09,403
I haven't seen her, I'm
here to pick up the check.

507
01:06:09,604 --> 01:06:11,371
Oh, okay.

508
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:14,074
Could you let me in or do you
have a key?

509
01:06:14,107 --> 01:06:15,275
Or could you just go in

510
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:16,678
- and see if she's there?
- No, I don't have key, sorry.

511
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:18,278
She took the key back.

512
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:19,747
She doesn't want to be bothered.

513
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:22,182
She doesn't want to be
bothered, I won't bother her.

514
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,508
Fuck.

515
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:52,079
Carlton, Jake, let me
know if you've seen Tommy,

516
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:53,515
will ya?

517
01:06:53,548 --> 01:06:55,048
I dunno where she's gone.

518
01:06:55,082 --> 01:06:56,551
I'm worried, I'm kind of
worried.

519
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:57,317
Let me know will ya?

520
01:06:57,351 --> 01:06:58,252
Thank you.

521
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:48,068
Hey, Al, is she there?

522
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,306
No, no, yeah, I'll call her.

523
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:53,206
All right.

524
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,274
Yep.

525
01:07:54,308 --> 01:07:55,175
Yep.

526
01:08:12,627 --> 01:08:13,493
Shit.

527
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:57,565
Why can't we just admit
what everybody knows is true?

528
01:09:57,765 --> 01:09:59,600
- Come on.
- She's not coming.

529
01:10:00,034 --> 01:10:01,936
She's not coming to rehearsal.

530
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:02,570
She's not coming to the show.

531
01:10:02,603 --> 01:10:03,871
She's not fucking coming.

532
01:10:03,905 --> 01:10:04,972
Just shut up.

533
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:13,246
James, if you guys cared about
her,

534
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,849
as much as you say you do,

535
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:16,851
you would've intervened before
now.

536
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:24,659
No.

537
01:10:24,692 --> 01:10:25,560
Shit.

538
01:10:36,704 --> 01:10:40,307
What are you losing by
doing this?

539
01:10:43,343 --> 01:10:44,712
My memories, I guess.

540
01:10:45,813 --> 01:10:47,515
All that stuff I've been seeing.

541
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,029
I know there's something else.

542
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:57,018
I'm sorry.

543
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:04,058
Find grace.

544
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:27,681
When we kill the creators,

545
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:32,019
we might as well tell the wind
to stop.

546
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:38,993
All that beauty that
allows us to dream, ends.

547
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:45,266
We're just workers, moving
door to door, picking up dust.

548
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:52,139
When we kill the creators,
we become reduced

549
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:56,210
to the lowest form of ourselves

550
01:17:57,912 --> 01:18:01,782
and our most primitive desires
take over.

551
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:07,755
When we kill the creators
without malice,

552
01:18:07,788 --> 01:18:12,826
or predetermination, without
even knowing what we've done,

553
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:19,867
we disconnect the conduit
between God and ourselves.

554
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:23,771
And that leaves us average.

555
01:25:57,692 --> 01:25:58,826
Okay. So cool.

556
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:01,261
This is what we need to do.

557
01:26:01,294 --> 01:26:05,298
Ah, Edward, the strange
things that's heading on out.

558
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:10,538
Find a way to get there.

559
01:27:53,641 --> 01:27:54,709
Yeah.

560
01:27:54,742 --> 01:27:55,408
Nice.

561
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:56,878
- Fine tune.
- Alright.

562
01:27:56,911 --> 01:27:58,579
Wow, okay.

563
01:27:58,846 --> 01:28:00,081
That sounds amazing.

564
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:01,048
Yeah.

565
01:28:08,756 --> 01:28:10,591
But it sounds
good with the piano right?

566
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:11,692
For that one...

567
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:13,094
Strange things is great, yeah,

568
01:28:13,127 --> 01:28:14,862
because that's the key link.

569
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:16,964
That's the key link to that.

570
01:28:16,998 --> 01:28:18,431
Yeah.

571
01:28:22,036 --> 01:28:24,105
You know the big fat bass?

572
01:28:24,138 --> 01:28:24,939
Yeah.

573
01:28:24,972 --> 01:28:27,708
If you could really just open it
up.

574
01:28:28,475 --> 01:28:29,911
I smell it.

575
01:28:29,944 --> 01:28:33,346
I smell it, sometimes
I have to roll in it.

576
01:29:12,987 --> 01:29:14,589
It's real tempting
to do that third part.

577
01:29:14,622 --> 01:29:15,756
It is I know.

578
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:16,691
You are a singer.

579
01:29:19,694 --> 01:29:21,461
Why don't we try it?

580
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:50,390
I think it should be

581
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:56,496
Sing in on that.
