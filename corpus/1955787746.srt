wasn't an accident,

that history is a choice.

1755
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:16,800

make such an impression?

Would you risk your family
for a tactic?

1803

- Would you risk your family?

1805
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,800
- Nonviolence is an ideology;
it's a movement.

- And defend my home.

- Well, the guns don't make me
feel any safer.

I have committed,

2093
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:04,333
along with all of us,

2094
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:08,934
is to object
to the twin battering rams

2095
01:42:08,934 --> 01:42:12,000
of segregation and oppression.

2096
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,266
The third and most basic sin
which all of us have committed

2097
01:42:16,266 --> 01:42:19,367
is having the moral courage
to stand up

2098
01:42:19,367 --> 01:42:24,000
and express our profound
weariness with this oppression.

2099

between the Negro

2104

and the white.

2105
01:42:38,734 --> 01:42:43,233
This is a conflict
between justice and injustice.

2106
01:42:43,233 --> 01:42:46,300
You see, most people
see nonviolence

2107
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:49,333
as a cowardly or weak thing.

2108
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:52,900
It is neither cowardly
nor weak.

2109
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:57,333
It is perhaps one of the
bravest forms of confrontation
