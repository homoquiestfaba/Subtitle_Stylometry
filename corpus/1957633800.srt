00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:19,976
[boat horn honks]

00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,507
[truck horn blares]

4
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,509
[man speaking on radio]

5
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:50,006
So, what noise does
this animal make?

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,704
Well, it'’s a pig
and it goes
"oink, oink, oink".

7
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:53,792
[giggling]

8
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:54,967
And how about this one?

9
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:58,058
Well, it'’s a cow
and it goes "moo".

10
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,363
And then,
this one goes...

11
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,799
[gasping]

12
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:03,106
Mrs. Shea, Mrs. Shea,
are you okay?

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,673
Mrs. Shea...

14
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:06,675
-[tires screeching]
-Mrs. Shea!

15
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:07,937
-Are you okay?
-[choking]

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,286
-[car honking]
-Look out!

17
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,509
[gasping and choking]

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,775
I'’m Pat Melancon
My daughter?

19
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,168
[receptionist]
Last room on the left.

20
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:27,304
[shushing]
There, there, baby.

21
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:29,306
There, there.

22
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,395
[Catherine sobbing]

23
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,527
Cath.

24
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,269
Honey, you know what?

25
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,401
Let'’s get dressed
and go home, okay?

26
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,362
Mom, will she be okay?

27
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,581
Of course she will.

28
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,106
And the doctor said that
you'’re all perfectly fine.

29
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:47,846
But, what happened?

30
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,372
What happened was
you saved the lives
of four people today.

31
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:53,025
Maybe more.

32
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,681
But you still have to wait
till you'’re 16

33
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,205
to get your
driver'’s license, okay?

34
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,338
All right, now where'’s
that other sock?

35
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,864
Mrs. Shea...

36
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,823
Her eyes rolled back
in her head

37
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:12,523
and she couldn'’t breathe
and passed out, and...

38
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,091
Honey, they said maybe
it was a food allergy,

39
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,441
or I don'’t know,
a reaction to
something in the air,

40
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,182
I mean,
Mrs. Shea has asthmas.

41
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,319
Oh, sweetie.

42
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:27,886
You'’re okay, baby,

43
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,280
it'’s all over.
It'’s all over, baby.

44
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:34,763
[organ playing softly]

45
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,333
[indistinct chatter]

46
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,578
[music stops]

47
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,365
Ms. West, that
was wonderful.

48
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,453
Oh, thank you, thank you.

49
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:13,976
How'’ve you been?

50
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,935
I turned 72-years-old
and a great grandmother
two times.

51
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,286
God'’s keeping me around
for his own purposes.

52
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,070
You know,
I haven'’t been here
to this church

53
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:24,247
since I kept house for that
priest in Baton Rouge.

54
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,380
I'’m non-denomination
since 1990.

55
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:27,903
But Helene had to go
to her daughter'’s,

56
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:30,166
so she asked me
to play for her.

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,474
And I said, "Well, God'’s music
doesn'’t recognize Catholic,
Baptist, whatever."

58
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:35,127
It just floats in the air
for everyone to hear.

59
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,347
Yes, and no one plays
like you Ms. West.

60
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,523
Well, maybe so,
maybe so.

61
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,743
Oh, my, your family
has grown.

62
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,266
Yes, Catherine,
Christopher.

63
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,833
Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:48,271
I was so sorrowed
to hear about your mama
and the cancer.

65
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:49,794
Your mama and daddy
and me

66
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:52,014
stood side by side
marching for integration

67
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,190
and you know
I loved her, your mama.

68
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,323
And she, you, Ms. West.
Thank you.

69
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,848
I lost my Yolanda
to cancer, too, too soon.

70
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,111
Her time was stolen from her
by all those

71
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,678
industries down there.

72
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,419
It was such a mess.

73
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,247
But do you think
anyone would listen to me
when I told them?

74
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,552
They all think I'’m crazy.

75
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,380
You know, Ms. West,
I just wanted to say hello

76
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,253
and to tell you
how wonderful it is
to see you looking so well.

77
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,559
Well, now you take care
of that family of yours,
Pat Melancon.

78
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:16,865
I will. Thank you.

79
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:18,693
Hey, Eric.

80
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,390
So, how'’s Emelda?
Did you get a word in edgewise?

81
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:23,001
Well, I hope I look
half as good as she does
when I'’m her age.

82
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,742
Just so as you don'’t
start talking that much.

83
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,615
Yeah, I bet this rain'’s
been good for your
sugarcane, huh?

84
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:28,703
It better be.

85
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,139
Eric'’s losing his lease.

86
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,923
Big plant coming in
from Japan.

87
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,927
Huge deal. A $700 million
petro-chemical complex.

88
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,365
Well, that'’ll bring some
new life in the economy.

89
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,628
Yeah, I'’m not so sure
we want that kind of life.

90
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,630
These lawyers from Shintech,
that'’s the name of the company,

91
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,806
show up,
and just like that.

92
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,503
Said they talked
to the council.

93
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:49,158
Well, I'’m on the council
and nobody talked to me.

94
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,291
-What?
-Eric'’s putting
a meeting together.

95
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,988
To learn more about
the plan and all.

96
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,206
Hey, you both should come.

97
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,296
Oh, I'’m working overtime.

98
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,949
Besides, being
an unemployed teacher,

99
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:59,647
Pat'’s more into learning
than I am.

100
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,779
Well, I keep telling him
it'’s never too late to start.

101
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,041
It'’s never
too late to start.

102
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,305
Come on, kids.

103
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:08,699
Come on, Christopher.

104
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,442
-Chris, go long.
-Okay.

105
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:13,704
Come on, get it, get it.

106
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,186
[Christopher] Catch.

107
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,361
Come on, I'’ll race you
to the backyard.

108
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:19,797
[Christopher] Okay, sure.

109
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,843
[birds chirping]

110
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:24,367
Christopher, slow down.

111
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,327
All right, now let'’s put
all the vegetables down here.

112
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,374
And then the potato salad,
so there'’s room for the meat
up there.

113
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,202
[Christopher]
What are you doing?

114
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:36,031
[Pat] James, don'’t put
any more sauce on that.
It just burns black.

115
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:37,075
[Darren]
Here. Dive for it.

116
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,208
[Pat] Hey, Darren.

117
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,298
Chris, do you need
your inhaler?

118
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,127
Hey, hey. Here.

119
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,999
Darren, I expect you
to know better than
to run him like that.

120
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,914
He'’s not a baby, ma.

121
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,483
Ma, after this we really
need to go and get me
a dress for the dance.

122
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:56,225
Oh, honey, I got to
help Darren with his
college aid application.

123
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:57,574
[Darren] Why we
gotta do that now?

124
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,750
Because in two years
you'’re going to college.

125
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,231
And we got to pursue every
grant and scholarship available.

126
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,059
Mom, you promised.

127
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,454
Yeah, to get a good dress
in case she dances with
Eddie Camarot.

128
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:10,065
-Shut up.
-[Pat] Hey,
Catherine Elizabeth.

129
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:12,415
-Be quiet.
-[Pat] Thank you.

130
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,591
All right, dinner'’s ready.
Come on, kids.

131
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:15,679
[James] Come on,
let'’s sit down.

132
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:16,854
Wheezer!

133
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:17,986
[James] Catherine,
that'’s enough.

134
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,031
[Pat] Dinner'’s ready.

135
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,033
Thank you.

136
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:27,430
Bless us, O Lord,
for these thy gifts which
we'’re about to receive

137
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,258
from thy bounty.
To Christ, our Lord.

138
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,433
[All] Amen.

139
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:41,009
[woman] Now, when you
compare Convent to other areas
in St. James parish,

140
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,708
there is 67 times more
toxic air pollution

141
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,406
and you compare Convent

142
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,539
to the industrial corridor
from New Orleans
to Baton Rouge,

143
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,455
which many consider
to be the most polluted
area in America,

144
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:58,592
there is 93 times more
toxic air pollution
per square mile, here.

145
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,420
Now you compare it
to Louisiana,

146
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:06,861
Convent is 130 times
more polluted than
the state as a whole.

147
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:10,778
It is no wonder that
parishes like yours
along the river,

148
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:15,173
rank highest in America
for deaths caused by cancer.

149
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:18,481
-Are there any questions so far?
-Uh, hi, I'’m Pat Melancon

150
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,135
and I grew up around here.

151
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:24,400
And, uh, I'’ve been around
these plants my whole life

152
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,358
and I just can'’t believe

153
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,317
that they would put
this stuff into the air

154
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,493
without somebody
imposing some kind of laws.

155
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:35,498
Yeah, well, all of these
toxic emission levels
are allowable

156
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,413
under Louisiana guidelines.

157
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,329
Take that chemical cloud
the other day on Highway 73,

158
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:43,985
where the woman passed out and
the child had to take the wheel.

159
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,597
That is what is known
as a toxic accident.

160
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:51,122
This is an acceptable risk
in the plant'’s operations.

161
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,646
[man] That'’s Pat's
daughter Catherine.

162
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,997
We'’re all
mighty proud of her.

163
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,696
So you'’re telling us that
we should all be glowing green,
or growing fins or something?

164
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,829
Or not.

165
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,483
What we want
to know about is Shintech.

166
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,397
Shintech.

167
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,008
Shintech would be
the second

168
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:11,142
largest petrochemical plant of
its kind in the whole world.

169
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,275
Proposed site,
right next to Freetown,

170
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:16,670
within a two mile radius
of all of Convent.

171
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,846
Now, Shintech has
requested permission

172
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,935
from the state
and your parish council.

173
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,371
Permission to admit

174
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:25,026
significant quantities
of five hazardous chemicals.

175
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,419
One, vinyl chloride

176
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:31,380
is a known cause of cancer.
and birth defects.

177
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,251
Two, ethylene dichloride,

178
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:36,428
a suspected human carcinogen
and fire hazard.

179
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,039
Three, methanol,

180
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,694
the cause of blindness
and liver damage.

181
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:44,785
Four, chlorine,
an asphyxiant, lung damage.

182
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:48,092
Five, hydrochloric acid,
highly toxic.

183
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:51,313
It would also emit
small quantities of chloroform,

184
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,445
carbon tetrachloride
and benzene.

185
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,493
All hazardous to
your air and water.

186
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,725
[James] Honey, did you get
my suit back from the cleaners?

187
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:12,900
[water continues running]

188
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:13,944
Hmm?

189
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,731
Uh, it'’s hanging
on the closet.

190
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,697
I love it when
you put on your suit.

191
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,307
I'’ll probably be
the only guy wearing one.

192
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,093
Hey, the union wouldn'’t
have you come to Baton Rouge

193
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,051
if they didn'’t
want you to run.

194
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,271
Vice President of local,
that'’s a big deal.

195
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,668
-Homework?
-Yep.

196
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,279
It'’s just notes
from the meeting.

197
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:48,196
Did you know that
PVCs contain dioxin?

198
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:52,635
The most toxic chemical
known to man.

199
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,812
That'’s the same stuff
they put in Agent Orange.

200
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,685
Oh, man, that stuff really
messed up lot of guys in Nam.

201
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:01,339
Yeah, well that'’s what
they'’re gonna produce
at this plant.

202
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:04,647
I don'’t think they'd want
to spray it on us.

203
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,301
What about accidents?

204
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,956
What about what happened
to Cath and Tammy?

205
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,653
That'’s what it was.
It was an accident.

206
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,091
They haven'’t built a new plant
here in 20 years.

207
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,137
People around here
need the jobs.

208
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,573
It'’s a good thing.

209
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,183
No use getting
everybody else scared.

210
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,752
Yeah, but even if 10%

211
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,711
of what they say
is true, I mean...

212
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,192
It hasn'’t hurt us.

213
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,805
I'’m still as healthy as I was
the day you met me.

214
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:39,726
[kids chatter]

215
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,339
-Hi, Andrea.
-Oh, hi, ladies.

216
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:45,949
-How'’re you?
-Good. Can I help you?

217
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:47,995
-Yeah--
-Pat Melancon!

218
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,170
Dale, how have you been?

219
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,693
Right as rain,
right as rain.

220
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,477
Good. You know
Gloria Roberts, right?

221
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,088
-Of course, I do.
Ms. Roberts.
-Morning.

222
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:55,698
-You still teaching?
-Oh, yes.

223
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,874
What about you, Pat?
Heard you'’re going
back to work.

224
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:00,181
Yeah. I hope to start up
next semester.

225
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,661
Christopher is old enough now.

226
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,619
Good. Parish needs
good teachers.

227
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
You know, we went
to this meeting last night,

228
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,623
because of this new
chemical plant, Shintech.

229
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,842
Do you know
anything about it?

230
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,452
Do I know about it?

231
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,889
When anyone wants
to spend $700 million

232
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,109
in our Parish,
you bet I know about it.

233
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,719
We were just curious
about them.

234
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,503
What they'’re going
to build and all.

235
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:21,202
Here you go. We got a ton
of information on them.

236
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:22,682
They are real
sharp guys.

237
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,858
Researched Convent thoroughly
before choosing us.

238
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,426
Lot of lawyers make
a lot of paperwork.

239
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,689
Ladies, help yourself.

240
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,212
Okay.

241
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:34,084
[Pat] "Dear, Mr. Kanagawa,"

242
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,738
I think that'’s how
you pronounce that,

243
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,219
"Let me emphasize
that Louisiana is
interested in having

244
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,134
you locate your
facility in this state.

245
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,919
I pledge the full support
of my administration."

246
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,008
-That'’s from
M.J. Foster, Governor.
-Hmm.

247
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:49,143
And this is, uh...

248
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:52,189
from Kanagawa to Dale
thanking him for
the lovely gift.

249
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:55,018
And here'’s toxic admissions.
We got to copy that one.

250
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,804
Okay now, this...

251
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,676
is sent to Shintech

252
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,723
describing all
the Coastal Commission

253
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,899
and the Parish
Council members.

254
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,901
"Donald Himes,
black male,

255
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,337
employed with
chemical industry,

256
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,252
very quiet,
noncontroversial."

257
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,777
[snorting] Try giving
his kid a '’C' in math.

258
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,432
I had the daughter
in third grade, and
the mom'’s even worse.

259
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,868
[both chuckling]

260
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,570
[Pat] You know, why would
they need to have all this
information about the council?

261
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,877
Well, like Dale says,
they'’re awfully thorough.

262
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,357
Want me
to copy that, too?

263
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,143
No, 25 cents a page,
we'’ll copy just what we need.

264
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,319
Okay, that
will be 29.75.

265
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:37,234
-Mmm.
-All right.

266
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:39,193
We could go broke
doing this.

267
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,368
Don'’t I know it.

268
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,765
[boat horn honks]

269
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,296
[clanking]

270
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,776
Whoa, that didn'’t
sound good.

271
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,300
[James] Motor'’s shot.

272
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,348
We need to order the part,
if they still make it.

273
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:07,177
You know we got that thing
when Darren was a baby.

274
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:10,093
[James] Well, maybe
it'’s time for a new one.

275
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,661
Mmm-mmm.
We can'’t afford it.

276
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:15,185
If you'’re going back
to teaching soon,
we can buy on time.

277
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,405
No, we are
maxed out, James.

278
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,582
[James] Okay. I'’ll see
if I can get the part.

279
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:26,631
Are you coming to bed?

280
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,024
You know, I'’ll be there
in a minute.

281
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,244
I'’m going to take some notes
on this new plant.

282
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,506
We'’re gonna have
another meeting.

283
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:35,989
Bet you'’re sorry Eric ever got
you mixed up in this thing.

284
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,904
No, it wasn'’t Eric's idea,
it'’s mine.

285
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,254
Why?

286
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,821
Well, don'’t you think
it'’s weird,

287
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,474
that the Parish Council

288
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,955
is practically giving
a welcoming parade

289
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,739
for this huge
chemical complex,

290
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,176
and nobody knows
anything about it?

291
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,656
Money talks.

292
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,529
Yeah, but Freetown'’s
practically in its shadow.
Look.

293
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,705
[James] Hmm. Well,
there'’s nothing you can do.

294
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:59,882
Sure. I mean, we can have
a meeting, invite everybody,

295
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,450
find out as much about it
before they build the thing.

296
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,930
Everybody including Freetown?

297
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,453
Especially Freetown.

298
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,889
I don'’t want you running
around Freetown by yourself.

299
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,586
-I'’ll be fine.
-I mean it, Pat.

300
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,416
All right. I'’ll find
somebody to help me.

301
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:18,379
[instrumental music playing]

302
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,716
[Pat] I mean, maybe I'’m
overacting, but...

303
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,631
it never hurts to get
more information.

304
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,721
[Emelda] All you need
to know is you are right
and they'’re wrong.

305
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,201
You are right.

306
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,986
They'’ll bring more pollution
into this community,

307
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,857
which has got too much
pollution already.

308
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,860
That may be true, Ms. West,
but we need to get our
facts straight.

309
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,514
Honey, put that
down there.

310
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:08,603
Mmm-hmm.
Facts, huh?

311
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,257
You know,
when I was a kid,

312
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,390
on the first Sunday
of every month,
we'’d have the baptizing

313
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:16,350
right down there
on the shallow part
of the river.

314
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:19,831
Now, I wouldn'’t put
my pinky toe in there.

315
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,399
See the land and the water
around here,

316
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,575
ain'’t no good no more,
except for some flowers,

317
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,447
'’cause we don't eat them.

318
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,711
Ms. West, if we can prove
that these plants cause
health hazards--

319
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,321
"If"? Don'’t be using
that word "if".

320
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,324
It is, "is" a health hazard.

321
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:38,720
"Is". When my Yolanda got
breast cancer ten years ago,

322
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,810
the plant said it was
from her taking
birth control pills.

323
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:46,032
"Well," I said to them,
"If that'’s true, then there are
a lot of men on the pill,

324
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,338
'’cause they're dying
from cancer, too."

325
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:52,125
See, these industries
get rich spewing poison.

326
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:55,606
Ms. West, I'’m terribly sorry
about what happened
to Yolanda,

327
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,739
but that happened
a long time ago
in Baton Rouge

328
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:00,960
and maybe because
of your loss, you can'’t
be objective about--

329
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,265
Are you saying
you don'’t want my help?

330
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,877
Look, Pat. God has
led you to here.

331
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,836
Just like He brought me
together with your mama,

332
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,099
marching to integrate
the schools.

333
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,796
I can remember you
on that bus,

334
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,798
so quiet and little.

335
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,019
Your family the only white
kids on the bus.

336
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:20,501
I was petrified.

337
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,199
But you were
on that bus.

338
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,204
Stop them
from coming here.

339
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:32,165
Stop them from pumping more
poison in our river and air.

340
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,081
Stop them from pumping more
poison in our river and air.

341
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,821
Stop them
from coming here.

342
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:40,086
Can I give you
this pamphlet... please?

343
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,392
Our meeting'’s
next week.

344
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:45,439
Do you want more petrochemical
plants in Convent?

345
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,747
Make an informed choice.
Do you want one?

346
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,619
Hey, can I give you this?

347
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,753
Why do I want to come
to some meeting for?

348
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:58,321
I'’d look like a fool
trying to stop a plant.

349
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:01,281
April, don'’t be saying
"can'’t" "no"
and all that negative.

350
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:02,934
'’Cause I just don't
want to hear it.

351
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,067
We need all the black people
in on this.

352
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:08,201
Else that big cancer
belching plant'’s gonna
be your neighbor.

353
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:11,595
How come the white folks
are so concerned?

354
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,858
Pat Melancon breathes
the same air we do.

355
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,469
It'’s a danger
to all of Convent.

356
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,949
We already got the killings
and the drugs.

357
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:21,040
But this here is something
we got a chance to do
something about.

358
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,394
I suppose you'’ll be
needing a ride
to the meeting.

359
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:29,613
April, I will be
truly grateful.

360
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,926
[Dale] Well, look who'’s doing
the cooking tonight.

361
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:41,016
Hi, Dale. Yeah, Pat'’s
been so busy planning
her meeting,

362
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,887
this is the only way
we are gonna eat.

363
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,064
I saw Pat the other day
at the office.

364
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,630
Yeah, she checked out
the Shintech deal.

365
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,763
She'’s a little worried
about the pollution and all.

366
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:51,113
You know, James,
there'’s nothing
to worry about.

367
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,246
All the hoops business
has got to jump through.

368
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,682
That'’s what I told her.

369
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,640
I better get this home
before it gets cold.

370
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,860
Oh, where did you say
that meeting was?

371
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:00,557
Tuesday, at
the community center.

372
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,255
That'’s it. You all
have a good one.

373
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,219
[birds squawking]

374
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,613
Catherine and Chris,
can you take the bus
home today?

375
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,571
Well, they said they'’d
have them copied by--

376
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:15,746
-Will you pick them up?
-Oh, jeez!

377
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,618
That'’s great. All right.

378
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:20,664
Oh, my God! I need
those papers tonight!

379
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,884
No, it'’s not you.
Christopher just--

380
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,755
You know what?
Let me call you back.

381
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,366
-[car honking]
-[Catherine] You'’re always
making a mess, Chris.

382
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,802
That'’s my ride.

383
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,847
-[James] Where'’s my wallet?
-[Pat] Laundry room.

384
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,980
Hey, Darren,
I need you home by 5:00.

385
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,068
Okay, bye.

386
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,331
It'’s so sticky.

387
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,420
[Catherine]
Don'’t touch me. Mom!

388
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,901
My lunch?

389
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:42,730
I didn'’t get to it.
Can you get
a sandwich at work?

390
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:46,037
I promise. After tonight,
everything will be back
to normal, okay?

391
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,301
[Darren] Mom, there'’s been
an accident.

392
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,259
My fingers
are stuck together.

393
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,782
[Pat] All right, honey.
I'’m coming.

394
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,177
[birds twittering]

395
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,092
[gentle music playing]

396
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,413
Hello, this is
Emelda West.

397
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,154
Is April around in there?

398
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,853
Oh. How long ago?

399
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:23,684
[Pat] Okay.
Come on, kids.

400
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,775
Let'’s go. I don't
wanna be late.

401
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,085
[Emelda] April had
to take her grandchild
to the hospital,

402
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,175
so the Lord provided me
with a chariot.

403
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,353
[Pat] What'’s going on here?

404
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:48,883
-[man] Hi.
-Hi.

405
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,972
-Uh, no, thank you.
-Ma'’am?

406
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:53,192
Don'’t you put
no sticker on me.
I'’m not here for that.

407
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,932
Well, please help yourselves
to some refreshments.

408
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,325
No, thank you, no.

409
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,805
Why don'’t you all come in
and take a seat?

410
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,373
Who'’re all these people?

411
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,896
[Emelda]
No friends of ours.

412
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,289
[man] These are
exciting times.

413
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,638
[Pat] This is not fair.

414
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:06,205
Emelda, hi.
I'’m so glad you're here.
Sit down

415
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:09,817
-Hi.
-Eric, what'’s going on here?

416
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,428
Looks like your meeting'’s
been hijacked by the
powers to be. Come on.

417
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,474
You'’re just gonna get
some power yourself.

418
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,781
Want you all to join me
in a St. James welcome to...

419
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:21,176
George Walker, Director
of Public Relations
for Shintech.

420
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:25,659
We don'’t want him here!

421
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:32,709
You can'’t shout out
like that.

422
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,537
I'’m most certain
you can.

423
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,670
Thanks for the opportunity
to come here and talk
to you all about

424
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,976
our company and about how
we treat our neighbors.

425
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,283
[whispering] You will not
get anywhere in that fight.

426
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:45,244
I won'’t get anywhere
with your flexing fingers
tucked in that bag.

427
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,289
They saw us coming.

428
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,465
We got to
fight back, man.

429
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:51,206
Chemicals are
a part of life.

430
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,078
Products derived from
polyvinyl chloride,

431
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:57,125
which is called PVC
are vital.

432
00:20:57,168 --> 00:21:01,434
Without PVC, you car
would cost you $1,000 more.

433
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:06,090
A typical home would cost you
at least $5,000 more.

434
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:09,920
PVC is used for water pipes,
and electrical insulation,

435
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:12,314
at the grocer
to preserve your meats.

436
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:16,100
It is also used
to substitute for
wood in construction,

437
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:19,800
and it is good
for the environment,
because it saves trees.

438
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:21,541
Of course, the most
important thing you'’d
wanna know.

439
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:22,759
Smooth, isn'’t he?

440
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,065
And I'’m happy to tell you.

441
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,023
Shintech will bring jobs.

442
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,851
A hundred and sixty-five
of them.

443
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,766
[people cheering]

444
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,985
[George] That'’s right.

445
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:41,909
They bought his lies.

446
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:48,089
[Mary] It'’s a good story.
When I heard this plant was
burning radioactive waste,

447
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,699
I thought something should
be done about it.

448
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,180
so I called up the Mayor
and I said,

449
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:54,313
"Hello, this is Mary Lee,
I'’d like to speak
to the Mayor."

450
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:56,750
Well, he didn'’t
return my calls.

451
00:21:56,793 --> 00:22:00,667
Three, four times.
So the hell with this.

452
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,191
Always loved that
"Mothers Against
Drunk Driving."

453
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:04,627
That was started
by one woman

454
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:07,238
empowering herself
to protect her children.

455
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,675
So, I called the Mayor'’s
office again,

456
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:11,286
but this time I said,
"Hello, this is Mary Lee Orr

457
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,942
"President of Mothers
Against Air Pollution."

458
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:16,552
-"Just a minute."
-[chuckling]

459
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:19,076
Hello, Mayor.

460
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,209
Well, that'’s when I learned
the power of organizing.

461
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:24,299
And nobody knows about
organizing like us mothers do.

462
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,954
Around here, no one is gonna
listen to a bunch of mothers

463
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,912
with all their PR people
and their lawyers.

464
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:30,697
[Emelda] If the Lord wants
our voices to be heard,

465
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,699
it don'’t matter
who we are.

466
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:35,919
Let'’s say from now on,
we start all our meetings
by joining our hands.

467
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,053
[soft piano playing]

468
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:44,972
Lord, this group is gonna
grow into a thunderous herd.

469
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:46,800
We'’re gonna talk loud,

470
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:50,064
so loud, Shintech
gonna hear us in Japan.

471
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:52,240
We'’re gonna stop them
from coming here

472
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:55,199
and polluting Your
beautiful earth. Amen.

473
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,027
[all] Amen.

474
00:22:57,071 --> 00:23:00,422
You know, maybe
the first thing that
we need to do

475
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:01,815
is form a committee

476
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:04,426
-to research the effects--
-There she goes.

477
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,212
Pat, the research
is in our homes
and our schools.

478
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,214
Now, I don'’t know
about you all,

479
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:12,695
but when I was growing up,
we didn'’t all have asthma,
or ear infections,

480
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,610
or chronic nosebleeds
like our kids do.

481
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,220
My own son has asthma,

482
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,440
and they say that
it'’s something that
kids just get.

483
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,704
Then St. James, Parish,
is gonna win the
"just getting it right."

484
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,272
You know, that'’s all
well and good, but if
we wanna do this,

485
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:26,013
we got to know
what we'’re talking about.

486
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:28,450
And in all that I'’ve read,
there is no proven link.

487
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,974
By the time scientists
prove it indisputably,

488
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:34,848
and by the time big business
allows them to say
they can prove it,

489
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:37,981
our kids will have
either grown up, or not.

490
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,942
Look, you all
are the moms here.

491
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,944
Nobody is gonna
fight this battle, but you.

492
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:45,989
Now.

493
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:50,907
All right. What do we do?

494
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:53,344
Get in their faces.

495
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,521
You hire a good lawyer.

496
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:56,826
And you elect
your officers.

497
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:00,308
You'’re the President.

498
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:03,659
No. You know, I'’m flattered,
Ms. West, but we need
to take a proper vote.

499
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:06,053
Anybody who doesn'’t want
Pat as President, say so.

500
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,794
[Pat]
Ms. West, I cannot do this.

501
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:10,144
I mean, I'’m gonna go
back to work and I'’ve
got my kids...

502
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:13,582
-I can'’t take this--
-Roseanne, you'’ve got
a fax machine.

503
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,801
You should be
the secretary.

504
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:19,022
Gloria, you are good
with numbers,

505
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,634
so she'’s the treasurer.

506
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:25,333
And Emelda, just what office
are you to boss us around?

507
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,335
[Emelda] I don'’t want
no office.

508
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:30,033
I don'’t want nobody
worrying about what
I'’m liable to say, you know,

509
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:31,731
in the name
of this organization.

510
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,820
I got to be free
to do and say

511
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,038
what I want,
when I want.

512
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:37,824
Now, let'’s get to work.

513
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:38,912
Okay.

514
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:46,615
[Friloux] The St. James
Citizens for Jobs
and the Environment.

515
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,748
It'’s quite
a mouthful, ladies.

516
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,880
Glad to see the word
"jobs" in your club'’s name,

517
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:53,753
because Shintech is going
to bring jobs to Convent.

518
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:58,235
Mr. Friloux, we need jobs
that don'’t pollute
our air and water.

519
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,500
And if you'’ll
just allow me.

520
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:05,982
Of the 23 million pounds
of toxins released
into the air annually

521
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:10,552
in St. James, Parish,
22 million are admitted
in a four-mile radius

522
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,772
in and around Convent,
and this includes

523
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,036
ethelne di... um...

524
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,127
Ethylene dichloride. Yes,
we know all about that.

525
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,305
I heard about you organizing
that meeting in Convent
last month, Mrs. Melancon.

526
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:27,917
Rest assured,
the Louisiana Department
of Environmental Quality

527
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:31,225
will make sure Shintech
preserves the quality
of the environment

528
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:32,748
before we grant
an air permit.

529
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,924
Just how far along
in that process
are you, James?

530
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,972
I heard you were
at the meeting, too,
Mary Lee.

531
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:44,281
I was there, too,
if you'’re keeping
some sort of list.

532
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:51,201
When we issue their
proposed permit,

533
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:55,292
as always, there will be
a public meeting for those
for and against it.

534
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:59,079
Now, if you want, I will fax
the permit application
to your lawyer for review.

535
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:02,299
Who is representing
your little group?

536
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:06,390
They'’re currently
interviewing attorneys.
For now, just fax them.

537
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:10,220
Well, all right. But you won'’t
be able to understand it,
because it'’s Greek.

538
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:14,268
Well, I'’ll just get somebody
who can translate Greek.

539
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,274
Well, that is your
prerogative, Mrs. Melancon.

540
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,715
-[phone ringing]
-[woman] Mr. Walker,
did you get that fax?

541
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,599
[keys beeping]

542
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:04,971
[Darren] It says,
"How have you exhibited
leadership in your community?"

543
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:08,061
Well, you'’re the team
co-captain for one thing.

544
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:09,584
I don'’t really think
that'’s leadership.

545
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,977
Of course, it is, honey.

546
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,676
Every time you take
responsibility for a group,

547
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,157
or an activity,
that'’s leadership.

548
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,593
And also you can...

549
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,682
Also what?

550
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:24,686
What'’s wrong, Mom?

551
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,906
Oh, nothing. We'’ve been
trying to get--

552
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:33,173
We'’re trying to get
legal help and everybody
keeps turning us down.

553
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:35,305
Catherine, will you help me
with dinner please, sweetie?

554
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:42,356
-Mom?
-Yeah.

555
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:46,273
How old were your
the first time you
kissed a boy?

556
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:50,320
Oh, I don'’t know, honey.
Maybe I was, uh, 16?

557
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:51,887
Some of my friends
have already done it.

558
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:56,936
I mean, well, you know,
not like French,

559
00:27:56,979 --> 00:28:00,809
[Christopher miming]
"Oh, Eddie!
Mmm. You kiss so well."

560
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,811
Shut up, you little jerk.

561
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:04,378
Hey, Catherine...

562
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:05,771
[kids yelling]

563
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:07,686
Yeah, hi, Mary Lee.
Can you call me back, please?

564
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,862
-He threw it at me, too.
-All right, that'’s it.

565
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,864
Quit complaining.
You threw it on me.

566
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:13,648
But why'’re you crying--

567
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,129
Why'’re you getting
mad at me? She'’s
the one who threw it.

568
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:17,304
It hit me.

569
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:18,914
Okay, both of you,
go to your room now

570
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,655
and don'’t come out
until I tell you.

571
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,268
-Now, go.
-Fine.

572
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,836
[breathing heavily]

573
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,623
[slow music playing]

574
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:51,686
[Pat] And the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Fund

575
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,385
told us that they sympathize,
but they just can'’t take on
a case like this at this time.

576
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:59,607
I mean, we'’ve pretty much
got the same thing from
all of them.

577
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,783
Now, Shintech has
a team of lawyers.

578
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:06,353
I mean, they'’ve got
scientists, PR firm,
engineering firm.

579
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:09,182
Not to mention
a pro-business Governor,
who'’ll bend over backwards

580
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:11,358
to bring 700 million
into the state.

581
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,663
[Emelda] Amen to that.

582
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:15,188
Thanks, John.
Meet Pat Melancon...

583
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,625
-Hey, John.
-And Emelda West.

584
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,888
You'’re a lawyer, baby?

585
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:22,151
This clinic is made up
of students like John,

586
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,371
who are in the last year
of law school.

587
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:26,590
The state allows them
to represent people
who can'’t afford

588
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:27,809
an attorney otherwise.

589
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,115
Yeah, we'’re the ones.

590
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,160
You shaving yet?

591
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:34,076
[Bob] Of course,
Lisa and I closely
supervise them.

592
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,558
And we can only handle
so many clients at a time.

593
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:40,256
Your case requires
hours of research.

594
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,607
There is the water permits,
the air permits,
public hearings,

595
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:45,696
the State Department of
Environmental Quality

596
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,961
all the way up to
the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency.

597
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:51,964
We are prepared
to do what it takes.

598
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:55,445
Environmentalists have
been trying to clean up
"Cancer Alley" for years.

599
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:57,273
But these are industries,
they just get stronger.

600
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:58,971
"Cancer Alley?"

601
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,973
The chemical corridor
between Baton Rouge
and New Orleans

602
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:03,714
It'’s where Convent is.
You'’ve never heard it
called that?

603
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:06,892
Well, would you call
your home something
like that?

604
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,546
I... I'’m really--
I'’m sorry. I didn't...

605
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:15,422
We'’re organized to put
that cancer in remission.

606
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,119
Now, are you going
to help us, or not?

607
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:25,475
I sincerely wish we could.

608
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,216
[Emelda] We don'’t
need them anyway.

609
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,565
Helping poor folk, hah.

610
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:30,829
Just look at
that Lisa LaVie.

611
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,788
She doesn'’t know
how poor folk can be.

612
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,137
Just look at her clothes.

613
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:36,312
Hah, we don'’t need them.

614
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,445
-We do need them.
-I say we don'’t.

615
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,882
Ms. West, we cannot
do this by ourselves.

616
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,842
We know enough about PVCs,
and chemical runoff,

617
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,235
and toxic waste and--

618
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,543
[tense music playing]

619
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:51,850
Oh, no!

620
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,288
[workers shouting]

621
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:05,820
They'’re starting construction.

622
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:09,171
How can they do that
without the permit?

623
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,260
They'’re doing it.

624
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,524
But they'’re not going
to get away with it.

625
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,064
They'’ve started digging.

626
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,631
Yeah. I believe it was
site preparation, yes.

627
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:36,807
Preparation, contamination,
damnation.

628
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,201
Ms. West, please.
Can you repeat that?

629
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:42,944
In Louisiana, a company
isn'’t supposed to begin
any construction

630
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:44,772
before obtaining
its permits.

631
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:46,208
Pretty arrogant move
by Shintech.

632
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:48,210
Or by the state.

633
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,559
[Pat] Wait a minute. 
You think the state 
approved this?

634
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,083
Get the car,
we'’re going to
Baton Rouge.

635
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,999
You know, who can...
Who can we talk to
about this?

636
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,957
[Emelda] Let'’s go, Pat.

637
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,264
I can make a call
and get back to you.

638
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:01,223
As a favor, Pat.
We still can'’t
take on your case.

639
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,529
So, I'’ll call you later.

640
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:03,704
[Pat] Okay.

641
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,403
One phone call, that'’s all.

642
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:08,927
-Lisa?
-I know.

643
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:25,421
You know, I'’ve thinking
about getting an organic
turkey this year.

644
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:27,902
They are kinda expensive.

645
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,991
My Union gives away
turkeys free every year.

646
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:31,253
Well, where'’re they from?

647
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,082
-Who?
-The turkeys.

648
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,259
I don'’t know.

649
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,479
Well, if they'’re from
around here, I won'’t have
my family even touch them.

650
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:44,179
What'’s gotten
into you, lately?

651
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,486
Look, the land
around here is poison.

652
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:48,096
[laughs scornfully]

653
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,403
Look, the plants around here
pollute the air and water,

654
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:53,623
which contaminates the soil
where they grow the grain
to feed the turkeys,

655
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,451
who drink
the contaminated water.

656
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,018
Okay, teach.

657
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,890
By the time that turkey
spends seven hours
in that oven,

658
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,936
no germs or bacteria
is gonna survive.

659
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,677
Well, fine. That'’s just
the kind of ignorance

660
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,157
that got us here
in the first place.

661
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,858
Look, Pat.

662
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:13,208
I know you'’re way
more educated than me.

663
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:16,342
But any idiot can see
you'’re going way overboard
with all this stuff.

664
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:17,604
What do you mean
by that?

665
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,649
You'’re talking
about our home.

666
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:21,869
A home that I work
damn hard for.

667
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:25,394
In one of these plants,
where I'’m lucky to be
employed.

668
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,049
Think about that next time
you start preaching
this liberal stuff

669
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,920
about how bad
it is around here.

670
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:37,058
[door slams]

671
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,974
So this will let Shintech
know that you'’re already
enabled to work

672
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,671
with them
here in Freetown.

673
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:42,977
And that includes you, ma'’am.

674
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,413
We'’d like
to sign you up, neighbor.

675
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,850
[woman] Honey, go on.

676
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:48,765
Look, keep your
fancy pen.

677
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:50,158
Do you know
who I am?

678
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:52,160
I don'’t think we've had
the pleasure of meeting.

679
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:54,815
Janice Dickerson, Director
of Community Relations

680
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:57,035
for the State Department
of Environmental Quality.

681
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,601
She'’s the mother West.

682
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:00,299
Ms. West, why don'’t you read
this before you judge us?

683
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:03,606
I know how to read
more than some folks here.

684
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,046
"I am interested in job
opportunities that Shintech
has to offer." Huh.

685
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,613
Anyone ever got no jobs
in these plants around here?

686
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:12,485
My five sons,
all educated,

687
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:14,835
all had to leave
the area to find work.

688
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,620
You all know, this Shintech,
ain'’t no different.

689
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:19,492
Ms. West, give us a chance.

690
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:21,755
That'’s right, Ms. West.
Give them a chance
to help you.

691
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,626
State shouldn'’t be
taking sides.

692
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,194
I'’m just here
building a bridge
between both sides.

693
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:29,067
Encourage development
and getting people
back to work.

694
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,720
If Shintech'’s gonna
give us jobs,

695
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:33,245
then you tell Shiintech
and your DEQ

696
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,247
to put that in
handwriting,

697
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,944
in handwriting.

698
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,598
Handwriting. See?
Mmm-hmm.

699
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:42,776
[gentle music playing]

700
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,608
[gentle snoring]

701
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:07,844
[Pat] Shintech asked
permission from the DEQ.

702
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:10,847
That'’s the Louisiana
Department
of Environmental Quality.

703
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:13,154
We know what
a DEQ is.

704
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:16,592
[Lisa] Anyway, the DEQ allowed
Shintech to proceed with
site preparation

705
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:19,508
based on a pretty sketchy
20-year-old guidance document.

706
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:20,770
[Pat] I don'’t understand.

707
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:23,164
I thought you said that
they couldn'’t start.

708
00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:26,428
By law, they shouldn'’t.

709
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:30,258
You need to draft a letter
to the DEQ challenging
the construction.

710
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:32,347
You need to CC
the Attorney General.

711
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,045
That'’ll stop them for now.

712
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,134
[Emelda] We hope.

713
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:39,354
[instrumental music playing]

714
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:49,495
-You married?
-Ms. West.

715
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:52,367
No, no. It'’s okay.
It'’s okay.

716
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,110
My boyfriend, Roger, and I
have been together
for three years.

717
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,592
And right now,
we don'’t really see
the need to get married.

718
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:02,725
Well, in here,
family is key.

719
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:07,208
See, Freetown was founded
right after the Civil War,

720
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:11,473
so lots of its people
descended from slaves.

721
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,867
We ought to get out
right here, '’cause you
can'’t drive down the lanes.

722
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,260
Okay.

723
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:17,653
[ambient noise]

724
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,411
[Emelda] Oh, Mavis.

725
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,152
-Hello, how are you?
-Oh, how are you, Mavis?

726
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,371
[indistinct talk]

727
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,982
[Emelda] Mavis here is
four generations.

728
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:44,463
Now five,
here in Freetown.

729
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:47,117
She grew up with
all those plants
around her.

730
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:49,772
Yeah, I grew up with
the odors, coughing,

731
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:51,731
my kids'’ ear infections.

732
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:54,429
Last year, the sirens
went off three times.

733
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,214
Shelter-in-Place Drill?

734
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:58,868
Yeah, that'’s what they
call them, but they
were no drills.

735
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:00,870
You hear the siren,
you'’re supposed to run
inside your house,

736
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:02,568
lock up all the doors
and windows so that can'’t no

737
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,700
outside air pollution
get inside.

738
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:07,790
Just stay there
until they blow
the all clear.

739
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:12,534
You could see this place
isn'’t exactly what
you call air tight.

740
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:14,623
[dog barking]

741
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,150
[Pat] Roseanne, I already
looked over the DEQ'’s.

742
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:22,501
You can hand them out,
but you might want to
vet '’em one more time.

743
00:37:22,544 --> 00:37:25,068
-You might wanna look--
-I'’ll pass them on.

744
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:27,201
All right, great.
Lunch, everybody.

745
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,073
Here we go.

746
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:34,600
This is gonna
save the Clinic

747
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:36,210
lots of time
in researching the briefs.

748
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,824
The clinic?

749
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:44,740
From this day forward,
the St. James Citizens
for Jobs and the Environment

750
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:47,090
is represented by the
Tulane Environmental
Law Clinic.

751
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,310
If you still want us.

752
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,442
[excited laughter]

753
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:51,530
Are you nuts?

754
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:53,314
Are you kidding!

755
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,143
Okay. Well, we don'’t have
a lot of time,

756
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:58,188
because we only
have 30 days

757
00:37:58,232 --> 00:37:59,973
to review
and file comment

758
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:02,410
before the state will make
its final decision
on the air permit.

759
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:03,933
Thirty days, that'’s good.

760
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:06,762
Considering they usually
allow 100 days of
public review

761
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,373
for a sewer expansion, no,

762
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,331
it'’s not good.

763
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:13,334
The State has put this
plant on fast track

764
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,771
and you'’re the only ones
standing in their way.

765
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,077
And we'’re not moving.

766
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,079
Well, we'’ll handle
the legal filings,

767
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,081
but you'’ve got
to get people
to the hearings.

768
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:23,126
And you got to get
people like Mavis.

769
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,999
People who can witness
how these plants destroy
the quality of their lives.

770
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,262
The community
will get behind us.

771
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,830
-Yes.
-And just remember,

772
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,093
you are going up
against a lot of power
in the state.

773
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:40,318
[indistinct chatter]

774
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,020
Famous Melancon
peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

775
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,197
Ah!

776
00:38:51,198 --> 00:38:52,460
What you got here?

777
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,983
It'’s the last sandwich
you'’ll ever eat.

778
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,074
Now, you'’re sleeping
on the job, huh?

779
00:38:58,118 --> 00:38:59,641
[factory whistle]

780
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:01,687
I got to get back.

781
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,950
What? You working
16 hours again?

782
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:05,908
Got to, bills to pay.

783
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:08,563
Well, I suppose Pat'’s
rabble rousing is getting
kinda expensive, eh?

784
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,481
It'’s not rabble rousing.

785
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:16,266
As a friend, Jimbo,

786
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,139
I hear a lot of guys saying
maybe you ought to keep
more of an eye on her.

787
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:21,750
You know, with Union
election coming up and all.

788
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,191
People should mind
their own business.

789
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:30,672
It is our business when
your wife goes traipsing
around the state

790
00:39:30,716 --> 00:39:31,717
meeting with the Governor.

791
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,330
[clock chiming]

792
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:46,296
The Governor
will see you now.

793
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,736
And it'’s not just
the elevated cancer,
asthma and birth defects

794
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:53,216
rates that exists
within our community,

795
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,394
we'’re also extremely
concerned about its

796
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,308
proximity to our
elementary school--

797
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:00,659
There'’s no proven
link here now, it there?

798
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:04,445
Look, Governor, we got
people sick and dying
right and left in our town

799
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:05,881
round all those plants.

800
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:08,406
Why do you think
they call it
the Cancer Alley?

801
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,320
There are regulations.

802
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:12,453
And doggone if this
administration is gonna
make sure

803
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:13,715
they'’re lived up to.

804
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:17,502
Now, the DEQ tells me
that Shintech so far,

805
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:19,721
has followed all
the Louisiana rules.

806
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:21,723
[Emelda] Now, that'’s
what we were afraid of.

807
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:24,465
Governor, could we ask
that you extend the public
comment period

808
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:27,207
on the air permits?
It'’s just we need more time.

809
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,690
You ladies got to understand
that companies have time tables.

810
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:34,562
They don'’t have eight years
to build a plant.

811
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:38,479
You hold them up to the point
it'’s economically
unfeasible to come here,

812
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,350
they'’re gonna go
some place else.

813
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:43,528
And Louisiana is gonna
lose a bunch of jobs.

814
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,138
Well, Governor,
with all due respect,

815
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:47,880
if industrial development
is supposed to bring jobs,

816
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:51,579
then why do we have
62% unemployed

817
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:54,495
in one of the most
industrialized parishes
in the state?

818
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:02,503
I'’m gonna give you
a couple of more weeks
on the comment period.

819
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,200
Thank you.

820
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:06,942
There'’s nothing else
I have the jurisdiction
to help you with.

821
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:08,727
Well, why not?
You'’re the government.

822
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,859
The last time I checked,

823
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:18,693
Heard you were
pretty impressive at
the Governor'’s office.

824
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:20,869
Well, I guess I was
too nervous to notice.

825
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:24,525
Here. I hope it helps.

826
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:25,961
It sure will.

827
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,486
Well, I got to take these
for the rest of my life.

828
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:33,229
Doctor said I lost
30% of my lung capacity.

829
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:34,927
It'’s the asthma that
made me real susceptible.

830
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,321
Sure makes it hard
chasing after the kids.

831
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:43,501
Tammy, you need to come
to the air permit hearing
next week

832
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:44,676
and tell about this.

833
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,070
I don'’t know, Pat.

834
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,464
It'’s just an accident
that I just happened
to drive through--

835
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,423
Yeah, but there was
no siren, no warning.

836
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,556
[Tammy] The company'’s
been real good to us.

837
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,253
They paid all
my medical bills.

838
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,125
They help when they can.

839
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,826
Well, I know everybody'’s
got to do what'’s best
for their family, but--

840
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,263
You know, I hope you have
a real good turnout, Pat.

841
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:09,831
Truly, I do.

842
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:16,621
[Pat] So Catherine has
dance practice five o'’clock
on Monday.

843
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:18,013
You know,
you should take
that one, James.

844
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:20,059
I got a meeting
at 4:30.

845
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:23,453
And Christopher stays late
for the Christmas pageant
every night this week.

846
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,499
Honey, what time do they
pick you up for that?

847
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,588
-I don'’t know.
-Are there any clean
glasses in this house?

848
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,503
Darren, please.
Just wash one.

849
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,462
You know what, call
Wanda at the school
and find out what time.

850
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,856
And Darren has basketball.

851
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,468
And you need to give
Kyle a ride, too, because
we carpool this week.

852
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:41,559
Oh, and Catherine'’s
got piano.

853
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:43,909
Yeah, and I'’ve got
dance on Thursday, too,
because of--

854
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:46,389
James, call and cancel
her piano.

855
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:48,000
You know what?
I can do that.

856
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:49,567
Don'’t put yourself
out there.

857
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,612
What do you
mean by that?

858
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:54,441
Never mind, go on.

859
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,399
No, you were
sarcastic with me.

860
00:42:56,443 --> 00:42:57,923
You have been
for weeks. Why?

861
00:42:58,401 --> 00:42:59,446
[James] Why?

862
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,057
Take a look
around you, Pat.

863
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,233
You'’re mad because
I haven'’t done the dishes?

864
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:05,800
You could do them,
you know?

865
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:08,629
I work two shifts.

866
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:12,285
All I ask is when
I come home there'’s
a place for me to sit down.

867
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:15,505
It'’s piled so high with boxes
that nobody'’s supposed
to touch but you.

868
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,507
Fine, I'’ll just move them.
All you have to do
is tell me.

869
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:19,292
[James] How can I
when you'’re always
on the phone?

870
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:21,555
Or out, God knows where
meeting the Governor.

871
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,991
Is that what
this is about?

872
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:25,167
-Mommy, Daddy, please stop--
-You could have told me!

873
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:28,301
-I only know the day before--
-How come the whole plant knew?

874
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:30,129
Beside, every time I talk
about my work,

875
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,217
you make me feel
like I'’m--

876
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,654
Your work?
Teaching'’s your work.

878
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:37,702
-That'’s work.
-You know that

879
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:40,661
I can'’t go back to teaching,
they'’re depending on me.

880
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:42,576

Oh, God.

883
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:50,105
James, help me.
Here we go, honey.

884
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,936
-It'’s okay, buddy.
-Here we go, here we go.

What'’s the doctor saying?

We did everything
we should.

889
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:29,014
He said the attack
was probably brought
on by stress.

890
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,540
Pat, that'’s why you've
got to stop all this.

891
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:36,456
No, James. That'’s why
I have to keep going.

892
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:39,241
I'’m not the reason
that Christopher has asthma.

893
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,896
It'’s the air we breathe,
and the water we drink.

894
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,508
The sick kids, the cancer
rates I'’m learning about...

895
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:46,771
It'’s killing us.

896
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:50,383
It probably killed
my mother.

897
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:52,951
You can'’t prove that.
You don'’t even know
it'’s true.

898
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:55,562
Yes, I do.
In my heart, I do.

899
00:44:55,605 --> 00:44:58,304
And your son in there,
struggling for breath...

900
00:44:58,347 --> 00:45:00,480
I mean that'’s all
the proof that
you should need.

901
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:03,135
Or Catherine, when Tammy
lost control of her car,

902

903
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,488
What they call an accident
almost killed our daughter.

904
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:11,534
And nobody, not the Governor,
not the Parish,

905
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:14,450
is doing anything
to prevent it from
happening again.

906
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:16,539
And what makes you think
you can do anything?

907
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,498
I don'’t know.
I don'’t know if I can.

908
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,761
But I care too much
about you and the kids

909
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:24,286
to let them treat our home
like a dumping ground.

910
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,767
And in that meeting
next week, we got
to fill the room

911
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:29,509
with people who care
as much about their
families as we do.

912
00:45:29,552 --> 00:45:31,206
And then there'’ll be
another meeting
and another.

913

We got to stay
in their face until they
take us seriously.

You gonna piss off
a lot of people, Pat.

In the application,

950
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:29,368
Shintech has categorized
two VCM cracking furnaces
as heaters.

951
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:32,023
But, their own
diagram show

952
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:34,416
the furnaces
convert EDC

953
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,245
to vinyl chloride
and hydrochloric acid.

954
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:39,595
It'’s a classic definition

chemical process reactor.

956
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:46,646
So they'’re calling it
a heater, when it'’s
really a reactor?

957
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,169
It certainly
appears that way.

958
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:51,129
Well, if a reactor leaks
it is a far more
serious situation.

959
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:53,261
I mean, have they provided
adequate protection for this?

960
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:58,571

998
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:47,549
We just got to fight them
with their own
procedure rules.

999
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:51,075
Show them we can,
'’cause "can't" is not
in the Lord'’s vocabulary.

1000
00:49:51,118 --> 00:49:53,338
Hi, I got here early
like you said.

1001
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:54,774
-Where do I sign in?
-Right there.

1002
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:55,949
Thanks.

1003
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,476
-You came.
-I'’m a little nervous.
Speaking in public.

1004
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,740
You'’re gonna be great.
Thank you so much.

1005
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:06,046
Just sign up
right there.

1006
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,223
Hey, Mrs. Melancon.

1007
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:11,878
Ha! It'’s good
to see you again.

1008
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:14,707
Now, I hear you'’ve got
a large family,
Mrs. Melancon.

1009
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,014
So please, here.
You help yourselves.

1010
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:23,150
[man] You may speak
in opposition to
the proposed permit

1011
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:26,632
in support or simply
to provide information.

1012
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:29,722
Your comments will
be recorded and taken
into serious consideration

1013
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:31,202
before a final
decision is reached.

1014
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:33,378
Now, I'’m gonna call
four names at a time, so,

1015
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:36,598
stand by and be ready.

1016
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:40,167
Our first speakers are
E.E. Schroeder for Shintech,

1017
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:41,386
in support.

1018
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:45,781
Rex Smith, in support.

1019
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:49,394
Wayne Sorenson,
in support.

1020
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:51,961
Joyce Baker, in support...

1021
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:54,007
You know, Sharon,
if you could just stay
a few more minutes,

1022
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,357
-I'’m sorry, but...
-Let me just give you...

1023
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:57,837
-I appreciate your coming.
-Thanks.

1024
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,100
Herbert Falkest, in support.

1025
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:05,062
[woman] Hi, thank you
and thank you to Shintech.

1026
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,802
You know I got
the early shift tomorrow.

1027
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,848
Yeah, I know.

1028
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:11,981
Why don'’t you
go on home, honey?

1029
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:13,853
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1030
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,289
[woman]
...support them in this.

1031
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,813
They'’re gonna bring
a lot of work to our community,

1032
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:19,119
which, as you all know,

1033
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:21,426
we could really use
at this time.

1034
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:23,471
-[infant crying]
-when there has been
so much unemployment.

1035
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:27,388
Pat, I'’m sorry. I really
have to go. I have
to put the babies to bed.

1036
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:29,782
You know, you really
made a difference
coming here tonight.

1037
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:31,740
-I appreciate it.
-All right.

1038
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:32,872
I'’ll talk to you soon.

1039
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:38,443
Uh, I own a small business
in Freeport, Texas,

1040
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:44,057
and... and what
that business is
selling mini motor homes.

1041
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,928
[mixed chatter]

1042
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:48,975
I got to tell you,
since Shintech
came in to town,

1043
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:50,498
my business
has tripled.

1044
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:52,239
[whispering] This is not...

1045
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:55,590
[man] And it'’s just been
wonderful thing for my family,

1046
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:57,636
and I have hired
more people,

1047
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,507
I mean, not a lot, but,

1048
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:02,336
I just wanted to share that
with you folks here in

1049
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,469
the great state
of Louisiana.

1050
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:06,732
And... I'’m proud.

1051
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:08,603
No, no, I'’m honored

1052
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:11,693
to have Shintech
as a neighbor.

1053
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:14,174
We got business
with Shintech, too.

1054
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,262
How about equal time?

1055
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:16,307
Yeah, how about it?

1056
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:19,092
[woman] We want equal time.

1057
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,182
[man] Courteous behavior
is expected of everyone
at all times.

1058
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:24,489
You guys took over
our meeting.
Now what about it?

1059
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:27,144
[man] Courteous behavior
is expected of everyone
at all times.

1060
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,232
Wait a minute.

1061
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:29,363
[man] Go get him, Pat!

1062
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:30,451
You just wait a minute.

1063
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:32,540
That'’s right.
You tell him, Pat.

1064
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:36,675
[people clamoring]

1065
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:38,242
Hey, hey, hey.

1066
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:39,460
Let her speak.

1067
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:42,333
Let her speak.

1068
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,987
[angry clamoring]

1069
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:46,119
Let her go!

1070
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,777
We don'’t want no riots
around here.

1071
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,474
You know what?
We'’re not going
to put up with this.

1072
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:55,650
The people of Convent
have to sit here and wait

1073
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:59,045
while they fly in
consultants and employees
from Texas?

1074
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:01,787
Shintech'’s got
a plant there, Pat.

1075
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,702
They flew in
the whole parish council
down there,

1076
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:05,660
and I tell you, you walk
into their plant,

1077
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:07,358
you can practically
eat off the floor.

1078
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,316
We'’re not talking
about the floor, Eric.

1079
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,624
That plant is one-third
the size of what they'’re
proposing here.

1080
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,495
I mean, it'’s apples
and oranges.

1081
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:17,106
-This is mal--
-Hey, you work for the state.

1082
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,283
Your obligation is to
make sure this process

1083
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:21,067
works for the people
who live here.

1084
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,809
I got people in there
waiting to speak,
who brought their kids.

1085
00:53:23,852 --> 00:53:25,419
Tomorrow'’s a school day.

1086
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:27,160
Perhaps they should
have left their kids home.

1087
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,293
You know what? They
can'’t afford a baby-sitter.

1088
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:31,251
They bring their
kids with them everywhere.

1089
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:33,079
Besides, I want
those kids there.

1090
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:34,733
I want those kids
at every meeting

1091
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:37,649
so you can see just
exactly who it is
you are poisoning.

1092
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:39,390
Oh, Mrs. Melancon, please.

1093
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:43,263
In the spirit of Christmas,
let'’s try to get along.

1094
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:56,276
Um, you know,
my husband put up
our tree today.

1095
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,018
And in the spirit
of Christmas,

1096
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:02,456
I would like to invite
Mr. George Walker
of Shintech

1097
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,936
to join me
at the podium.

1098
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:05,720
[people booing]

1099
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:09,071
-[man] Go home.
-[woman] Go home.

1100
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:12,379
Thank you, Mr. Walker.

1101
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:14,207
Now, if I'’m not mistaking,

1102
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,209
this plant will be
the only one

1103
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,125
of its kind
to manufacture
all three

1104
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:24,348
Vinyl chloride monomer,
ethylene dichloride,
and polyvinyl chloride.

1105
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:26,437
Did I say those
all right?

1106
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,960
You'’re doing fine
Mrs. Melancon.

1107
00:54:28,003 --> 00:54:29,135
Thank you.

1108
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:30,963
You want a job?

1109
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:33,531
That'’s funny. It's funny
you should say that,
because

1110
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:38,013
Shintech is going
to guarantee 165 jobs
to the people living here.

1111
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:40,189
-Is that right?
-Well, we'’re certainly
going to guarantee

1112
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:43,454
equal opportunity.
Obviously, it'’s a
two-way street.

1113
00:54:43,497 --> 00:54:46,283
People have to be
educated, have
computer skills.

1114
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:49,547
Okay, so are you planning
to train us?

1115
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,463
Well, uh, understand
first and foremost,

1116
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:55,857
I work for
a profit making
corporation.

1117
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:59,948
Well, just how many of us
are gonna get those 165 jobs?

1118
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:01,820
How many?

1119
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:03,256
[Emelda]
Answer the question!

1120
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,780
That'’s impossible,
really, to answer tonight.

1121
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:08,305
Okay, what about safety,
Mr. Walker?

1122
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:11,917
The vinyl chloride monomer,

1123
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,702
the primary dangerous
chemical, which you
pronounced so nicely,

1124
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:19,751
Mrs. Melancon, will not
be present in quantities
that would harm anybody

1125
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:22,449
even with prolonged
exposure over a lifetime.

1126
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:24,321
[Emelda] Just enough
to kill you, slowly.

1127
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:25,496
Right.

1128
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:27,585
And what if
there'’s an accident?

1129
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:31,110
The plant is designed
with safety in mind.

1130
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:33,112
The community
will be warned.

1131
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:35,201
Sirens will go off.

1132
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:39,727
Residents will follow
Shelter-in-Place
procedures.

1133
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:43,688
Right. So they should just
go into their homes to their
airtight walls and windows?

1134
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:45,385
[George] Yes, yes,
that'’s right.

1135
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:47,431
You know, next time
you'’re in Freetown,
Mr. Walker,

1136
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:50,259
just check out how
airtight their walls
and windows are.

1137
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:53,393
That is right.
That is right.

1138
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:55,961
-You come to Freetown.
-Come see that.

1139
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,963
I mean, we may be poor,

1140
00:55:58,006 --> 00:56:01,488
and we may be unskilled,
but we are not stupid.

1141
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:02,881
-[Emelda] That'’s damn right.
-[applause]

1142
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:08,234
And we'’re sick and tired
of industry coming here

1143
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:11,019
and leaving us nothing
but bad odors,

1144
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:12,978
-and toxic fumes.
-Absolutely.

1145
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:16,111
And leaving our children
with asthma
and ear infections,

1146
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:18,418
our loved ones dying
of cancer.

1147
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:20,638
[woman] Damn right.

1148
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:23,641
Listen to what
she'’s sayin'.

1149
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:25,338
You'’re gonna
take care of our kids?

1150
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:28,689
We have waited
a long time.

1151
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:30,517
I mean, I'’m not just
talking about tonight.

1152
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:33,302
We have waited
a life time

1153
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:36,393
to say enough is enough.

1154
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:37,872
[woman 1] That'’s right, Pat.
Tell him, Pat.

1155
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,221
[woman 2] She'’s telling
you the truth.

1156
00:56:39,265 --> 00:56:40,745
Enough is enough.

1157
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:42,268
That'’s right!

1158
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:44,270
Enough is enough.

1159
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:46,054
[all chanting]
Enough is enough.

1160
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:47,795
Enough is enough.

1161
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,667
Enough is enough.

1162
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,451
Enough is enough.

1163
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:53,061
Enough is enough.

1164
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,672
Enough is enough.

1165
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:56,238
Enough is enough.

1166
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:03,855
So, that'’s it?

1167
00:57:03,898 --> 00:57:06,335
[Lisa] The DEQ
approved the air permit.

1168
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:08,860
But we still have
the Environmental
Protection Agency

1169
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:10,688
and they can veto it.
We sent in
our objection--

1170
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,254
You know, we got
all those people there

1171
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:14,039
and then they
went ahead as if
we were invisible.

1172
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:17,085
You know they have been
on Shintech'’s side
from the very beginning.

1173
00:57:17,129 --> 00:57:20,393
[Lisa] If we can prove
to the EPA how
biased they are,

1174
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,177
then we'’ve
really got a case.

1175
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:23,657
[Gloria] What about
all those letters

1176
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:26,573
that we saw over
at the council office, Pat?

1177
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:28,488
From the Governor
and Dale welcoming them.

1178
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:30,098
You saw these?

1179
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:32,144
They sent a list
to Shintech

1180
00:57:32,187 --> 00:57:35,756
describing the council
members that would
be cooperative.

1181
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,410
Pat, we need
to get these letters.

1182
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:44,809
Well, James did all
the Christmas shopping
this year, Lisa.

1183
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:46,854
I barely spent
Christmas day
with my kids.

1184
00:57:46,898 --> 00:57:48,465
What kind
of a mother is that?

1185
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,249
A mother who knows
what'’s more important
than gifts.

1186
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:55,123
I'’m sorry, but I don't
really think you know

1187
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,343
what it'’s like to give up
so much time with your family.

1188
00:57:57,386 --> 00:57:59,476
-Shh. Pat...
-No, she can'’t know

1189
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:02,174
how much it hurts
to let down the people
that you love.

1190
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:05,046
Pat, Lisa postponed
her wedding.

1191
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:08,093
After three years
Roger'’s finally going
to do the right thing--

1192
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:09,268
[Gloria] Who'’s Roger?

1193
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,617
How do you
know this, Emelda?

1194
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,967
Because I ask
questions, that'’s why.

1195
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:16,275
Everybody is so concerned
about minding their
own business.

1196
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:18,495
We are
each other'’s business.

1197
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:20,366
You know what I mean?

1198
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:26,546
Lisa, I feel terrible.

1199
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,593
-I'’m so sorry.
-That'’s okay.

1200
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:31,986
I don'’t have time
to plan a wedding
right now, so...

1201
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,728
I'’ll get married in June,
after we stop Shintech.

1202
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:40,473
I don'’t think
we'’re going down
the right path

1203
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,606
is we start talking
about contract and out.

1204
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:44,956
We need something
to bargain with.

1205
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:49,264
Well, I can'’t let my men
lose overtime
to contract workers.

1206
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:51,963
Ah, James, you ain'’t got
a whole lot of credibility
around here,

1207
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:53,573
when it comes
to protecting jobs.

1208
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,227
Yeah.

1209
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,359
Your wife'’s out there
fighting tooth and nail
against jobs.

1210
00:58:57,795 --> 00:58:59,405
What jobs?

1211
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:01,494
You all know,
a new plant comes in here,

1212
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,409
it considers us
too unskilled.

1213
00:59:03,452 --> 00:59:05,411
Won'’t even train us
for better jobs.

1214
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:07,544
I think Pat'’s
got you trained.

1215
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:10,024
-Open your eyes.
-Open yours.

1216
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:12,070
I'’m surprised as hell
she'’s still standing.

1217
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:17,162
[tense music playing]

1218
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:18,337
Is that a threat?

1219
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,731
Just an observation.

1220
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:25,387
[tense music playing]

1221
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:39,619
Now I need your
tax returns from
last year.

1222
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:41,316
Dad said to ask you.

1223
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,537
Uh, Darren, I can'’t
get it right away if you
need it this week.

1224
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,321
[phone ringing]

1225
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:48,323
That'’s definitely for you.

1226
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:50,891
[Pat] Hello.
Hi, Ms. West. Well...

1227
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:54,982
Oh, Lord. All right.

1228
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:57,594
All right,
I'’ll be right there.
I'’ll be right there.

1229
00:59:59,857 --> 01:00:01,510
Hey, Darren,
could you watch
Chris for me?

1230
01:00:01,554 --> 01:00:03,512
Why is it you can
always say yes
to them?

1231
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:07,255
[tense music playing]

1232
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,171
[crash]

1233
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,000
[dog barking]

1234
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,055
"The St. James Citizens
for Jobs and the Environment

1235
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:27,667
have banded together
with several radical
environmental groups"?

1236
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:31,671
I mean, "using
scare tactics to
frighten citizens.

1237
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,282
Support Shintech
locating in Convent."

1238
01:00:34,326 --> 01:00:38,678
Hmm. As fas as I can see,
they sent this to everyone
in Convent. Anonymously.

1239
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,462
Damn fools even
sent it to me.

1240
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:42,551
I mean, who would
have sent such a thing?

1241
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:44,031
[Lisa] The number
on the postage meter

1242
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:46,555
traces it back
to the parish
council office.

1243
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:47,687
Are you sure?

1244
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,733
Yes, they sent out
over 400 of them.

1245
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,910
It'’s just more
proof of bias.

1246
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:54,738
Lisa, I really
appreciate your help.

1247
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:55,956
Oh, Pat, come on.

1248
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,045
You'’re our client,
it'’s our job.

1249
01:00:58,089 --> 01:00:59,786
Besides, missing a chance
to nail these guys

1250
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,222
will be like
missing Mardi Gras.

1251
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:02,571
It'’s just not possible.

1252
01:01:24,637 --> 01:01:26,595
I don'’t know
what list you refer to.

1253
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:28,728
It was a letter
to Shintech'’s law firm

1254
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,469
listing the members
of the council,

1255
01:01:30,512 --> 01:01:32,384
and it was here
a couple of months ago.

1256
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:34,429
Well, maybe you should
have copied it
a couple of months ago.

1257
01:01:34,473 --> 01:01:35,735
Is Dale here?

1258
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:37,868
I think he'’s
in a meeting. Why?

1259
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:40,914
Well, I don'’t suppose
you know anything
about an anonymous flier

1260
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,569
that was sent out
to 400 residents
of Convent

1261
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:44,918
in support of Shintech?

1262
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:46,746
[phone ringing]

1263
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,575
[Pat] Fifteen pages
to copy.

1264
01:01:49,618 --> 01:01:51,795
[Andrea] Fifteen pages
at 75 cents a page.

1265
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:53,318
[Pat] Wait, wait, 75 cents?

1266
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:55,537
It used to be
25 cents a page.

1267
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:58,018
Well, it went up.

1268
01:01:58,062 --> 01:01:59,585
[Lisa] These are
public records.

1269
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:02,153
Louisiana law prohibits
charging more than
the actual cost

1270
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:04,024
of copying the document.

1271
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:05,722
Seventy-five cents
just the same.

1272
01:02:10,509 --> 01:02:13,425
Now, Mrs. Melancon
and her ladies group here

1273
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:15,514
having been asking
some questions about

1274
01:02:15,557 --> 01:02:18,082
that flier sent from one
of our offices,

1275
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,171
and about a dossier
sent to Shintech

1276
01:02:20,214 --> 01:02:22,782
with profiles of all of us
here on the council.

1277
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:25,002
They claim it shows
the council is biased.

1278
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:27,178
Therefore, we should
all recuse ourselves.

1279
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:30,790
Well, this is the
big league, ladies.

1280
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,184
When Shintech asks us
for a scouting report

1281
01:02:33,227 --> 01:02:35,708
so that they would know
who the players are,
we give it to them.

1282
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,927
That'’s not bias.

1283
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,929
That is promoting
development.

1284
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:41,148
Now we'’re elected to do that.
Elected by the people.

1285
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:44,935
Now, if there are
no more questions,

1286
01:02:44,978 --> 01:02:48,416
we will vote on the
motion to issue Shintech
the coastal use permit.

1287
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,591
All in favor?

1288
01:02:49,635 --> 01:02:50,636
[all] Aye.

1289
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:52,420
Opposed?

1290
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:01,429
Steamrollered meeting
after meeting.

1291
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:06,043
Ms. West, don'’t you
ever get exhausted
by this?

1292
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:09,437
When the Lord gives me
all the wakefulness
I need to do is work.

1293
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:12,614
Then He tells me,
"Emelda, it'’s time
for you to shut the phone,

1294
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:14,921
shut your eyes
and give yourself
some rest."

1295
01:03:15,443 --> 01:03:16,967
So, I do.

1296
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,012
Now, I know, it'’s not
so easy for you.

1297
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:21,449
You got the kids.

1298
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:22,929
And then it'’s just
the kind of person
you are,

1299
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:24,191
who just gives and gives.

1300
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,241
[tense music playing]

1301
01:03:33,418 --> 01:03:34,811
Hold on.

1302
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,425
-What are--
-Shh.

1303
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:48,999
I think I'’m
being followed.

1304
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:50,696
That car,
I see it everywhere.

1305
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:54,047
I'’m scared.

1306
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:55,919
That'’s why they do it.

1307
01:03:55,962 --> 01:03:57,529
I'’m afraid for my kids.

1308
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:58,791
Don'’t be afraid
for your kids.

1309
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,053
Don'’t be afraid
for yourself.

1310
01:04:00,097 --> 01:04:02,229
The Lord did not put
us here to live in fear.

1311
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:04,101
I don'’t want to hear
nothing about no fear.

1312
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:05,798
You'’re right, Ms. West.
I'’m sorry.

1313
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:09,149
Then learn
to pace yourself, Pat.

1314
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:11,325
Or else you'’re going
to burn out like some
used up engine,

1315
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:12,544
can'’t run no more.

1316
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:14,415
Now, you go home
and rest.

1317
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:15,852
Put Shintech away
for a while.

1318
01:04:16,287 --> 01:04:17,418
I will.

1319
01:04:22,728 --> 01:04:24,164
Go home and rest.

01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:33,930
[door opening]

1329
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:38,935
Mom? Mom!

1330
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:42,808
[Christopher]
Mama, are you okay?

1331
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:44,288
[Darren] Did you
total the car?

1332
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:45,898
No, she didn'’t
total the car.

1333
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,857
You kids should
be in bed. Go, go on.

1334
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:50,642
[Christopher] Good night,
Mummy and Daddy.

1335
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:52,600
[James] Okay, everybody
get to bed.

1336
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:54,298
Everything'’s okay now.

1337
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:55,777
[Catherine] Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

1338
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:06,875
They'’re just worried
about you, Pat.

1339
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:09,661
I know. I know.
I'’ll go in there
in a minute.

1340
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:14,100
What am I gonna do
without a car?

1341
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:15,928
Well, first let'’s see
how bad the damage is

1342
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,843
Darren and I
could probably do
a lot of the work.

1343
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:20,019
Uh-uh, we cannot
afford this.

1344
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:22,630
Well, we can'’t afford
to lose you either.

1345
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:24,806
I mean it, Pat.
You got to be more careful.

1346
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,069
You watch your back.

1347
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:28,158
What do you mean?

1348
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:29,986
Just that, uh...

1349
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,902
I don'’t know. The guys
at work have been talking.

1350
01:06:33,946 --> 01:06:35,687
And there is that
anonymous flier
going around.

1351
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,515
I know where
that flier came from.

1352
01:06:37,558 --> 01:06:39,734
Well, it don'’t make it
any easier knowing
where it comes from.

1353
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:42,737
It'’s harder when you know
its your friends or neighbors
who are gunning for you.

1354
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:44,000
I know.

1355
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,699
Is all this
really worth it?

1356
01:06:48,439 --> 01:06:50,919
Yes, yes, it is, James.

1357
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:52,225
All right.

1358
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:03,019
[Lisa] The EPA can'’t
do this to them.

1359
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,716
[Bob] Well, they did.

1360
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:07,066
I assured them
that if all else fails,

1361
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,328
they still have
the almighty

1362
01:07:08,372 --> 01:07:09,895
Environmental
Protection Agency.

1363
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:12,289
I mean, how can they
ignore all of our objections?

1364
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:14,291
[Bob] Because they
never saw them.

1365
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:15,814
But we sent them
months ago.

1366
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:18,034
The guy who was
reviewing Shintech
got transferred.

1367
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:20,427
So he gave your comments
to his supervisor--

1368
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:21,907
Who never looked at them.

1369
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,039
Said they were misplaced.

1370
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:26,433
So now their friends

1371
01:07:26,477 --> 01:07:28,522
at the DEQ are free to go
ahead and issue
the air permits?

1372
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:31,090
It was probably
just an honest
bureaucratic mistake.

1373
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:33,440
-Honest?
-Let'’s just stay cool
and look at this

1374
01:07:33,484 --> 01:07:34,963
through another door, okay?

1375
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:37,531
Now, the good news is
the EPA advised both

1376
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:39,098
DEQ and Shintech

1377
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:40,795
to address
the EJ issue.

1378
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:43,494
EJ?

1379
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:44,756
Environmental Justice.

1380
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:50,805
[Lisa] Our position will be
that it'’s discriminatory.

1381
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:53,112
It'’s a violation of the
Civil Rights Act

1382
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:54,983
that took place
at a facility like Shintech,

1383
01:07:55,027 --> 01:07:58,248
in an area that is
predominately poor,
predominantly black,

1384
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,684
an area that'’s already

1385
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:02,513
disproportionately
impacted by toxic waste.

1386
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:04,471
We are poor
and mostly black

1387
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,908
and all sick of being
dumped on.

1388
01:08:06,952 --> 01:08:08,867
So we'’ll petition
the EPA to hear
our arguments.

1389
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:13,045
If they agree...
then Convent could provide
a perfect test case.

1390
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,700
Especially since there
are already six
chemical plants here.

1391
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,223
Well, what do you mean,
"test case"?

1392
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:19,138
Well, the Environmental
Justice argument,

1393
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:20,661
is based on
a Presidential
order that

1394
01:08:20,705 --> 01:08:22,272
Clinton signed
three years ago.

1395
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:24,056
It'’s never been tested.

1396
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,753
[Gloria] But they'’ve
already got their
air and water permits.

1397
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:27,755
-We can reverse
all the permits.
-[Emelda] That'’s good.

1398
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:29,757
It'’s about all
of Convent,

1399
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:33,457
but we do need the black
community to come out
strongly against Shintech.

1400
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,764
Well, as long as this
doesn'’t become just
about race.

1401
01:08:36,808 --> 01:08:39,854
I don'’t see black or white,
I just say wrong is wrong.

1402
01:08:39,898 --> 01:08:42,683
[upbeat music playing]

1403
01:08:47,949 --> 01:08:49,212
[Emelda] All of us together.

1404
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,476
We need your help.

1405
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:56,567
We need your help.

1406
01:08:57,568 --> 01:08:58,830
Ms. Emelda.

1407
01:09:00,614 --> 01:09:02,703
Things will be
better here, '’cause it's...

1408
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,444
Would you look
who'’s coming to dinner!

1409
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:06,968
Janice Dickerson.

1410
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:18,589
Yeah, hey, Roseanne,
I gotta go. James...

1411
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:21,069
he hates me always
being on the phone.
Thanks.

1412
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:26,684
This whole thing
just stinks to
high heaven.

1413
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:32,777
April Larose
called me a racist?

1414
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:37,042
[phone rings]

1415
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:40,828
Hello?

1416
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:41,960
[man] You stop 
messing with our lives,

1417
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:43,004
or we'’re gonna 
fix you good.

1418
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:47,574
Who is this? Who is this?

1419
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:51,491
You leave my wife alone!

1420
01:09:56,583 --> 01:10:00,239
[Emelda] No, Ms. April.
This is not you here
talking, is it?

1421
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:02,241
That'’s my name there.

1422
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:05,505
"Pat Melancon and friends
have done a complete
about face.

1423
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:07,899
Hung up their sheets,
anointing themselves,

1424
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:10,118
our champions
and protectors."

1425
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:12,512
"Hung up their sheets"?
April...

1426
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:15,907
You know, I have nothing
personal against
Pat Melancon.

1427
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:18,866
Yeah, and here,
look. See?

1428
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,825
"The exploitative views

1429
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:22,522
of the color
of our skin,

1430
01:10:22,566 --> 01:10:25,090
and our socioeconomic
condition..."

1431
01:10:25,133 --> 01:10:27,092
Now, now, Ms. April,

1432
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:30,835
Where in the last two weeks
did you learn this kind
of vocabulary?

1433
01:10:30,878 --> 01:10:33,577
I just happened to know
some words you didn'’t know
I know.

1434
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,882
You slinging mud here.

1435
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:36,710
Letting the enemy use you.

1436
01:10:36,754 --> 01:10:39,278
That Janice Dickerson
putting words in your mouth.

1437
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:41,498
Pat Melancon
put words in your mouth.

1438
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:44,152
Who'’s saying that?
Not anyone who knows me.

1439
01:10:44,196 --> 01:10:47,286
You know anybody who can
put words in my mouth?
No, no, no.

1440
01:10:48,113 --> 01:10:49,941
[phone ringing]

1441
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:01,213
[Catherine] That'’s
driving me crazy.

1442
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:04,129
Cath, you know
what'’s going on.

1443
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:06,087
You know, it just
might be for someone
other than you.

1444
01:11:07,045 --> 01:11:08,481
[phone ringing]

1445
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,789
I can'’t stand
this anymore.

1446
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:14,052
Everybody at school
treats me so weird.

1447
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:16,576
Who at school?

1448
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,970
What, the boy, the one
that Chris is always
teasing you about?

1449
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:22,147
Mom, you don'’t know
anything. It'’s
not about boys.

1450
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:24,018
It'’s about this
and what you'’re doing.

1451
01:11:24,062 --> 01:11:26,151
What I'’m doing?
What has that got
to do with you?

1452
01:11:26,194 --> 01:11:28,458
It'’s got everything to do
with me. You are my mother.

1453
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:29,633
[Emelda] Pat.

1454
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:32,853
Pat.

1455
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:38,337
Here'’s something to wrap up
the shrimp shells
and other garbage.

1456
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:41,471
Yeah, well it'’s too late.
The EPA is gonna see this
and think that

1457
01:11:41,514 --> 01:11:43,951
everybody in Freetown,
all your people are
for Shintech

1458
01:11:43,995 --> 01:11:46,519
and I'’m some kinda
brainwashing bigot.
Catherine?

1459
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:48,869
-All my people?
-[door slams]

1460
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:51,655
My people do not all
wear the same color
on the same day or

1461
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:54,005
listen to the same
Louis Armstrong records.

1462
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:55,833
Or eat chicklets
and watermelons.

1463
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:57,922
They'’re individuals,
free to do what they think.

1464
01:11:57,965 --> 01:12:00,098
Well, I'’m an individual,
they'’re gonna think
I'’m a racist.

1465
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:01,317
Do you think that, too?

1466
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,362
I know you'’re
not a racist, Pat.

1467
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:05,669
You'’re good as gold.
Everybody knows that.

1468
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:08,454
But you got to know that
they'’d send people in there
to divide and conquer.

1469
01:12:08,498 --> 01:12:09,934
You know what?
You should take over.

1470
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,762
Because I can'’t change
the color of my skin.

1471
01:12:11,805 --> 01:12:13,067
and since that'’s
the problem--

1472
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:15,113
Now look, we can'’t
let them do that.

1473
01:12:15,156 --> 01:12:18,638
Ms. West, no more speeches.
Not today... please.

1474
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:26,037
Look... Just let it just...
Just... Just...

1475
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,473
let it be for a while.

1476
01:12:27,517 --> 01:12:29,780
Just... let it be.

1477
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:36,439
-[Pat] Catherine... hey.
-[knocking on door]

1478
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,099
Catherine, I'’m sorry.

1479
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,711
Can we finish
our talk now?

1480
01:12:47,754 --> 01:12:50,104
We weren'’t
having a talk.

1481
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:53,412
Well... I wanna hear
more about what'’s
happening at school.

1482
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:55,327
No.

1483
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,766
Sweetheart, I'’m so sorry.

1484
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:01,899
I didn'’t know
that all this was
going on.

1485
01:13:01,942 --> 01:13:06,817
Mom, they call you names
like "Crazy Pam Melancon
too big for her breeches"

1486
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,471
"the two-bit
coccyx avenger."

1487
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:09,994
Well, honey,
those kids are
just ignorant.

1488
01:13:10,037 --> 01:13:12,388
Those kids are
my friends.

1489
01:13:13,258 --> 01:13:15,434
Or at least
they used to be.

1490
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:17,871
And now they hardly
ever talk to me
and it'’s not fair.

1491
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:20,004
It'’s not my fault.

1492
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:22,441
Everything was fine
before all this
Shintech crap.

1493
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:24,530
Catherine Elizabeth,
you watch your language.

1494
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:26,053
Who cares about
the language?

1495
01:13:26,097 --> 01:13:27,098
I care.

1496
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:29,622
I care.

1497
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:31,711
And I care about you.

1498
01:13:31,755 --> 01:13:34,279
I need you
to understand that
I'’m doing this--

1499
01:13:34,322 --> 01:13:36,803
Mom, you'’re doing this
for me, yeah, right,
whatever.

1500
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,547
All right, well,
maybe I can...

1501
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:43,767
I don'’t know,
I can go to school,
talk to your teacher--

1502
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,333
Mom, just stay out of it.

1503
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:48,424
Stay out of my life.

1504
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:49,642
That should be easy.

1505
01:13:55,779 --> 01:13:56,997
[Lisa] Pat, Pat.

1506
01:13:57,607 --> 01:13:58,999
Got important news.

1507
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:05,092
The EPA has agreed
to hear our Environmental
Justice argument.

1508
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:06,877
So you better get your
frequent-flier card,

1509
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,487
because we'’re going
to Washington.

1510
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:09,836
[all cheering]

1511
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:15,276
I can'’t go.

1512
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,583
-I can'’t.
-What'’d you mean
you can'’t go?

1513
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:18,715
We don'’t even
have to pay.

1514
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:20,891
I can'’t do this anymore.

1515
01:14:24,808 --> 01:14:26,287
It can'’t be
worth it.

1516
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:28,289
My family is
falling apart.

1517
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,204
They'’re dragging
our names through
the mud.

1518
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,685
Pat, we cannot
do this without you.

1519
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:34,208
[Pat] Of course, you can.

1520
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:35,775
No, Pat.

1521
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:37,951
You can come at them
with the statistics,
the science,

1522
01:14:37,995 --> 01:14:39,736
the history, everything.

1523
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:43,130
Look, no matter what I do,
I'’m gonna be letting
somebody down.

1524
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:47,308
Either my family,
or the group. And I
have to make a choice.

1525
01:14:47,352 --> 01:14:49,441
First and foremost,
I am a mother.

1526
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:51,835
And I am a wife.

1527
01:14:51,878 --> 01:14:55,142
And I can'’t be those things
and do this, too.

1528
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:57,318
I can'’t.

1529
01:15:01,758 --> 01:15:03,934
Hold up. You know
I can'’t walk that fast.

1530
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:06,240
Are you telling me

1531
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:07,633
you'’re just gonna
walk away from us?

1532
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,419
After everything your
family has already done?

1533
01:15:12,116 --> 01:15:13,552
Already sacrificed?

1534
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:16,250
After everything
you sacrificed,
to get so close?

1535
01:15:16,294 --> 01:15:17,469
We'’re not even close.

1536
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:18,775
We'’re Washington DC close.

1537
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:21,168
Ms. West, I'’m sorry,
but I can'’t do this.

1538
01:15:21,212 --> 01:15:22,996
Pat, if I could'’ve
fought with you

1539
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,869
when my Yolanda
was a baby, she
might be alive today.

1540
01:15:25,912 --> 01:15:27,653
But I didn'’t have
nobody like you.

1541
01:15:27,697 --> 01:15:30,656
Nobody, no intellectual
to be shouting with.

1542
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,615
I was just a lonely voice
in the wilderness.

1543
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,051
Nobody took me seriously.

1544
01:15:34,094 --> 01:15:35,966
But now, you'’ve
got the facts.

1545
01:15:36,009 --> 01:15:37,837
I still got
my loud voice.

1546
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:40,274
We'’re making
a difference together.

1547
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:43,887
We do it to give our kids
a chance and a future.

1548
01:15:45,758 --> 01:15:47,325
Pat, you can'’t
walk away!

1549
01:16:01,339 --> 01:16:02,688
[car approaching]

1550
01:16:03,254 --> 01:16:04,864
[dog barking]

1551
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,434
[car door shuts]

1552
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,045
I'’m off the phone.

1553
01:16:12,089 --> 01:16:15,135
There'’s a chicken
in the oven,
and the couch is yours.

1554
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:16,572
Now, don'’t pass out
from shock.

1555
01:16:19,531 --> 01:16:23,230
There. Now, I'’ve got
to pick Catherine up
from her dance class.

1556
01:16:23,274 --> 01:16:25,276
-So, I'’ll be back
in ten minutes, okay?
-I lost.

1557
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:27,887
The union election?

1558
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,628
Mm-hmm.

1559
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:34,154
Oh, Lord. James,
I'’m so sorry.

1560
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:35,982
This... this is
all my fault.

1561
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:39,333
I guess they got me.

1562
01:16:40,857 --> 01:16:42,989
Now, we just got
to make sure
they don'’t get you.

1563
01:16:43,033 --> 01:16:44,600
Nobody'’s gonna
get me.

1564
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:45,731
[James] That'’s good.

1565
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:46,863
Because I quit.

1566
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:50,736
-You what?
-Yeah, I... I realized...

1567
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:53,783
that you and the kids
are the most important
thing to me.

1568
01:16:53,826 --> 01:16:55,393
I need to be here for you.

1569
01:16:55,436 --> 01:16:57,090
-But--
-And I'’m not.

1570
01:16:57,134 --> 01:16:58,614
I'’m go back to teaching,
and I'’m going to bring
in some money,

1571
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:00,180
so you don'’t
have to work
all the time.

1572
01:17:00,224 --> 01:17:02,618
I'’m going to
make this up to you,
James, I promise.

1573
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:05,925
I know you'’re
a hard-headed woman,

1574
01:17:05,969 --> 01:17:07,623
you'’re gonna do
what you want,

1575
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,494
but I do not think
it'’s right to stop
fighting this now.

1576
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,670
No, uh-uh, no.

1577
01:17:11,714 --> 01:17:13,498
No, no, not you, too.

1578
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:15,282
I thought this is what
you wanted.

1579
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:17,545
Well, sure I want it.

1580
01:17:17,589 --> 01:17:21,158
But you'’ve been fighting
a long time, and now it'’s
starting to make a difference.

1581
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:23,290
They'’re scared of you, Pat,
because you are right.

1582
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:25,728
And they know it.

1583
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:28,818
You can'’t stop now.
That'’s what I mean by
not letting '’em get you.

1584
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:31,211
I lost that election today,
'’cause the guys at the plant,

1585
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:33,126
they don'’t understand
what'’s at stake here.

1586
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:37,087
You still got some
teaching to do,
Mrs. Melancon.

1587
01:17:41,265 --> 01:17:45,225
A handful of Louisiana 
housewives filed suit 
against Shintech.

1588
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:47,532
a Japanese conglomerate 
proposing to build

1589
01:17:47,575 --> 01:17:49,882
a $700 million 
petrochemical plant

1590
01:17:49,926 --> 01:17:51,971
in a neighboring 
sugarcane field.

1591
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:56,236
The group is calling itself, 
The St. James Citizens 
for Jobs and the Environment.

1592
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,762
And their President 
is Pat Melancon, 
school teacher and mother.

1593
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:01,720
We have all 
the evidence we need

1594
01:18:01,764 --> 01:18:05,245
to prove that Shintech'’s plant
poses an unacceptable threat

1595
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:07,073
to the health
of our community.

1596
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:09,641
And if the state
of Louisiana will not
protect us,

1597
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,991
then we have got
to take our argument
to a higher level.

1598
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,605
Okay. Emelda'’s in the car.
They'’re waiting for you.

1599
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:19,433
I will pick up
Catherine from dance,

1600
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:21,522
and Gloria'’s gonna
take Chris to
basketball practice.

1601
01:18:21,566 --> 01:18:22,828
Now, you got
your ticket?

1602
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:25,309
-Oh, Lord, I don'’t know.
-Pat, sweetheart...

1603
01:18:25,352 --> 01:18:27,050
It is gonna be fine.

1604
01:18:27,093 --> 01:18:29,269
You know everything
backward and forward.

1605
01:18:29,313 --> 01:18:31,184
There is nothing
to be nervous about.

1606
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:33,534
It is just a little old
government agency

1607
01:18:33,578 --> 01:18:34,971
and you are our pit bull.

1608
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:36,973
I know that. That'’s not
what'’s wrong.

1609
01:18:37,016 --> 01:18:39,627
Well, what is it that
has gotten you so jumpy?

1610
01:18:39,671 --> 01:18:41,804
I'’ve never flown
in an airplane before.

1611
01:18:46,156 --> 01:18:47,940
[chuckling]

1612
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:55,034
[Emelda] We thank thee,
Oh, Lord,
for the wings to fly us

1613
01:18:55,078 --> 01:18:57,515
safely to our 
nation'’s capital.

1614
01:18:59,256 --> 01:19:01,867
So that we may raise
our voices in harmony

1615
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:05,479
with the good people
of the Environmental
Protection Agency.

1616
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:09,832
Lord, continue to help us
stop Shintech.

1617
01:19:11,224 --> 01:19:13,923
Keep them out of
Convent and Freetown.

1618
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:15,402
Yes, Lord, help us.

1619
01:19:15,446 --> 01:19:18,797
Take the power and
help us claim the victory.

1620
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:20,799
-Amen.
-Amen.

1621
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:22,801
[female reporter] 
What started as a battle 
against toxic waste

1622
01:19:22,845 --> 01:19:24,498
in a small 
Louisiana town,

1623
01:19:24,542 --> 01:19:27,327
has evolved
in the EPA'’s
first test case

1624
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:29,721
on the issue of 
Environmental Justice.

1625
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,375
Together with 
Tulane University'’s

1626
01:19:31,418 --> 01:19:32,855
Environmental Law Clinic,

1627
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:35,814
these women have 
ruffled some big feathers.

1628
01:19:35,858 --> 01:19:37,163
[Foster] 
And I'’ll tell you this.

1629
01:19:37,207 --> 01:19:38,948
I'’m gonna look 
differently at Tulane

1630
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:41,298
from the perspective 
of having major tax breaks,

1631
01:19:41,341 --> 01:19:44,562
if what they'’re gonna do 
is support a bunch 
of vigilantes out there

1632
01:19:44,605 --> 01:19:46,042
that make their own laws.

1633
01:19:46,085 --> 01:19:48,000
They say that 
your failure

1634
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:50,916
to appreciate 
the people'’s need 
for representation

1635
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,700
makes you look 
like a bully.

1636
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:54,398
Who'’s a bully?

1637
01:19:54,441 --> 01:19:57,053
The big fat professors 
drawing big salaries,,

1638
01:19:57,096 --> 01:19:59,229
trying to run people 
out of the state?

1639
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:02,928
Or me, who is saying, 
"Please, come to Louisiana,

1640
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:06,584
bring us some jobs, 
jump through the hoops 
and do it right."

1641
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,629
[Pat] Now, we know 
it'’s gonna get 
meaner and uglier

1642
01:20:08,673 --> 01:20:10,370
before it gets better.

1643
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:12,633
But you haven'’t met mean 
and you haven'’t met bad

1644
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:14,853
until you'’ve met 
a mama protecting 
her young.

1645
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:17,464
and that'’s who we are. 
We are the mamas

1646
01:20:17,508 --> 01:20:19,989
and the daddies 
protecting our young.

1647
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:22,730
Pat and most of the others 
got kids.

1648
01:20:22,774 --> 01:20:25,777
But I'’m free to go 
anywhere the organization 
needs me.

1649
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,040
And I'’ve always said,

1650
01:20:28,084 --> 01:20:30,390
I will go all the way 
to Japan to tell Shintech 
in their backyard

1651
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:32,349
that we don'’t 
want them in ours.

1652
01:20:35,656 --> 01:20:38,746
[Emelda] We are a small,
poor community.

1653
01:20:39,922 --> 01:20:42,272
And we are sick
and tired.

1654
01:20:42,315 --> 01:20:44,840
Tired of fighting

1655
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:48,582
for what should
make sense
to most everybody.

1656
01:20:48,626 --> 01:20:51,281
Now, we have nothing
personal against you,

1657
01:20:51,324 --> 01:20:52,717
or Japan.

1658
01:20:54,023 --> 01:20:56,373
But we are
overburdened.

1659
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:58,810
You see this?
This is where

1660
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,290
all the people live.

1661
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,248
And here is where
your plant is
supposed to go.

1662
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,643
Here'’s the school.

1663
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:13,651
I have a petition,
signed by over
1,000 residents.

1664
01:21:14,652 --> 01:21:16,132
Some drawings,

1665
01:21:16,175 --> 01:21:18,569
art work
from the children.

1666
01:21:22,312 --> 01:21:23,530
I know.

1667
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:26,490
You all probably
have little ones, too.

1668
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:32,365
[upbeat music playing]

1669
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:41,592
[phone ringing]

1670
01:21:41,635 --> 01:21:43,594
-Have you heard from Tokyo?
-Yeah.

1671
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:45,683
She called, but we had
such a bad connection,

1672
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:48,904
all I can hear about was
what a hard time she had
finding a good hamburger.

1673
01:21:53,865 --> 01:21:55,954
Where'’s the other
Shintech file?

1674
01:21:55,998 --> 01:21:58,217
I think you have
enough here.

1675
01:21:58,261 --> 01:22:01,481
Andrea, it'’s public record
and I want to see it.

1676
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,060
It'’s still
75 cents a copy.

1677
01:22:18,803 --> 01:22:20,587
That'’s okay.
We don'’t need you
to copy them.

1678
01:22:29,466 --> 01:22:30,858
[Pat] You know so much
about this,

1679
01:22:30,902 --> 01:22:32,556
I feel you could
practically do it
on your own.

1680
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:34,775
Not without you.

1681
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:36,821
What'’re you
talking about?

1682
01:22:36,864 --> 01:22:39,389
Was it because of
what the Governor
said about Tulane?

1683
01:22:40,564 --> 01:22:41,608
I'’m pregnant.

1684
01:22:43,219 --> 01:22:44,524
I didn'’t know
how to tell you.

1685
01:22:44,568 --> 01:22:46,962
Oh, no, Lisa. It'’s
the Lord'’s blessing.

1686
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,574
I'’m not gonna
be much help
in a few months.

1687
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:51,705
I mean, not
for a while, anyway.

1688
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:54,012
Yeah, I know.

1689
01:22:54,056 --> 01:22:57,755
But it'’s you and Ms. West
and it'’s the other ladies who
really make a difference.

1690
01:22:57,798 --> 01:23:00,105
You just concentrate
on having a healthy baby.

1691
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:04,980
Okay.

1692
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:13,901
Pat.

1693
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:18,036
I hope I'’m half as bad
and mean a mother
as you are.

1694
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:28,873
[people chanting]
Enough is enough!
Enough is enough!

1695
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:30,483
And I knew then,
Praise the Lord,

1696
01:23:30,527 --> 01:23:32,137
I'’ve reached
the heart of Shintech.

1697
01:23:32,181 --> 01:23:33,965
There was no doubt
in my mind.

1698
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,055
See, you can tell a lot
about a man'’s heart

1699
01:23:37,099 --> 01:23:38,752
by when he chooses
to move his feet.

1700
01:23:38,796 --> 01:23:40,058
Now, you remember that.

1701
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:41,146
I will, Grandma West.

1702
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:42,365
Don'’t call me, Grandma.

1703
01:23:42,408 --> 01:23:43,975
Grandma West

1704
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,150
[Pat] Hey, Roseanne.

1705
01:23:45,194 --> 01:23:46,499
There'’s Meryl and Bob.

1706
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:47,587
Hi.

1707
01:23:47,631 --> 01:23:49,111
-Hey, Bob.
-Hi.

1708
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:50,764
-Hello, Bob.
-Yes.

1709
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:53,506
We got the message
that the EPA vetoed
their air permit.

1710
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:55,813
-Now what?
-Well, it will
buy us some time.

1711
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:58,642
They found over 50
technical errors
in their permit,

1712
01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:00,470
including our student'’s
discovery that their

1713
01:24:00,513 --> 01:24:02,689
heaters were
actually reactors.

1714
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:05,083
It will take them months
to rewrite those applications.

1715
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:07,868
So, meanwhile we just
brace ourselves
for the next round?

1716
01:24:07,912 --> 01:24:09,566
Let'’s just hope
we'’re still here.

1717
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:12,134
The Governor has
asked the state
supreme court

1718
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:15,572
to investigate
the Student Law Clinic,
especially ours.

1719
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:18,705
They could restrict us
representing groups
like yours in the future.

1720
01:24:18,749 --> 01:24:21,012
That'’s because we've
been so effective together.

1721
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,100
You should be
proud of that.

1722
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,189
We are proud,
and we are strong,

1723
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:26,017
and now we got
some marching to do.

1724
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,323
-Yes.
-All right.

1725
01:24:27,366 --> 01:24:29,499
Hold that banner
real high.

1726
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:32,850
Enough is enough.
Enough is enough.

1727
01:24:32,893 --> 01:24:36,767
Enough is enough.
Enough is enough.

1728
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,029
Enough is enough.

1729
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,901
We have marched
from the capital

1730
01:24:40,945 --> 01:24:44,775
to the Governor'’s mansion
to find that Governor Foster
has gone fishing.

1731
01:24:44,818 --> 01:24:46,385
[crowd groaning]

1732
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:48,692
[Pat] Yeah, that'’s right.
He has gone fishing.

1733
01:24:48,735 --> 01:24:52,087
What is it gonna take
for our officials

1734
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:56,656
to realize that $700 million
plant like Shintech

1735
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,919
cannot bring back
hundreds of lives.

1736
01:24:58,963 --> 01:25:00,878
Excuse me.

1737
01:25:00,921 --> 01:25:04,447
Seven hundred million dollars
cannot bring back one
single human life.

1738
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:05,709
[crowd agreeing]

1739
01:25:05,752 --> 01:25:06,840
That'’s my mom.

1740
01:25:06,884 --> 01:25:09,060
We'’re sitting
on a time bomb

1741
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,758
and the future
of our children...

1742
01:25:11,802 --> 01:25:15,414
I mean,
all of our children
is at stake.

1743
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:18,591
Now, when
are our officials
gonna wake up?

1744
01:25:18,635 --> 01:25:21,725
And realize that they have
to put people first...

1745
01:25:21,768 --> 01:25:24,075
[crowd supporting]

1746
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,425
And quit putting
profits first.

1747
01:25:26,469 --> 01:25:30,386
And we'’re not
gonna go away
until they do.

1748
01:25:30,429 --> 01:25:31,822
-Is that right?
-Right.

1749
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:35,782
We'’re gonna stay
in their face
every single day,

1750
01:25:35,826 --> 01:25:37,697
until they clean up
their act.

1751
01:25:37,741 --> 01:25:39,917
[crowd applauding]

1752
01:26:00,677 --> 01:26:03,810
[ship horn blowing]

1753
01:26:07,901 --> 01:26:10,165
-[James] Pat?
-Yeah.

1754
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,644
[James] Darren left
something for you.

1755
01:26:13,037 --> 01:26:14,517
It'’s on the
kitchen table.

1756
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,692
[Pat] All right.

1757
01:26:31,229 --> 01:26:32,578
[soft music playing]

1758
01:26:40,543 --> 01:26:42,240
[sobbing]

1759
01:27:15,142 --> 01:27:16,535
-Amanda?
-Oh, no...

1760
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:20,844
[people chatting]

1761
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,849
Lisa? There she is!

1762
01:27:27,938 --> 01:27:29,287
With the baby.

1763
01:27:31,724 --> 01:27:32,899
[all clamoring]

1764
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:38,514
I'’m good.

1765
01:27:38,557 --> 01:27:41,038
What a beautiful boy!

1766
01:27:41,081 --> 01:27:42,213
Don'’t worry, Roger.

1767
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,649
I'’ve done this once
or twice before.

1768
01:27:44,998 --> 01:27:46,609
Thank you
for driving down.

1769
01:27:46,652 --> 01:27:48,045
Oh, God, I wouldn'’t
have missed it.

1770
01:27:49,438 --> 01:27:51,614
Darren. Hey, Darren.

1771
01:27:51,657 --> 01:27:53,659
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1772
01:27:53,703 --> 01:27:56,314
And besides, ladies,
I have some information
for you

1773
01:27:56,358 --> 01:27:58,055
that I just couldn'’t
phone or fax.

1774
01:27:58,098 --> 01:28:00,318
Even though the EPA
hasn'’t ruled yet,

1775
01:28:00,362 --> 01:28:01,711
on our Environmental
Justice suit,

1776
01:28:01,754 --> 01:28:02,929
What'’s happened now?

1777
01:28:03,974 --> 01:28:05,280
Shintech surrendered.

1778
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:10,894
What do you mean?

1779
01:28:10,937 --> 01:28:13,113
[Lisa] I mean, they realized
that you ladies weren'’t
gonna go away and they

1780
01:28:13,157 --> 01:28:15,551
couldn'’t afford any more
delays, so they cut
their losses and they'’re

1781
01:28:15,594 --> 01:28:16,943
gonna locate elsewhere.

1782
01:28:16,987 --> 01:28:18,858
Outside of St. James Parish.

1783
01:28:21,165 --> 01:28:22,514
Thank you.

1784
01:28:22,558 --> 01:28:25,082
[excited exclamations]

1785
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:27,563
[Emelda] We did it!
we did it together,
you see?

1786
01:28:27,606 --> 01:28:29,173
We did it together.

1787
01:28:29,956 --> 01:28:31,175
We did it!

1788
01:28:33,395 --> 01:28:36,006
And the new plant,
by the way,
will be far smaller,

1789
01:28:36,049 --> 01:28:39,792
and it will not produce
vinyl chloride, chlorine,
or EDC.

1790
01:28:41,185 --> 01:28:43,796
[hooting and cheering]

1791
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:53,632
[rousing music playing]

1792
01:29:01,814 --> 01:29:03,381
[Pat] I love it here
so much.

1793
01:29:03,425 --> 01:29:05,383
[baby whimpering]

1794
01:29:05,427 --> 01:29:07,777
[Lisa] I bet after two years
it feels good to have
your life back.

1795
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,692
[Pat] Mmm.

1796
01:29:09,735 --> 01:29:11,781
You know, I'’d do it
all over again.

1797
01:29:11,824 --> 01:29:12,912
[Lisa] Really?

1798
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:15,741
The people I'’ve met...

1799
01:29:16,655 --> 01:29:18,744
Regular, hardworking people,

1800
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:21,007
who care about their kids
and their homes.

1801
01:29:23,445 --> 01:29:24,794
It'’s very powerful.

1802
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:28,580
Well, I'’m relieved
it'’s over.

1803
01:29:28,624 --> 01:29:31,540
Oh, don'’t talk crazy.

1804
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:32,802
There'’s nothing over.

1805
01:29:33,629 --> 01:29:35,239
We stopped Shintech,

1806
01:29:35,282 --> 01:29:37,415
but there'’s plenty
other polluters

1807
01:29:37,459 --> 01:29:39,112
propelling me
to fight this fight.

1808
01:29:40,592 --> 01:29:44,204
You know, I believe your God
has me here for a reason.

1809
01:29:44,248 --> 01:29:45,902
You know, I got
a late start.

1810
01:29:45,945 --> 01:29:49,209
Like Moses was 80
when He started to use him.

1811
01:29:49,253 --> 01:29:53,518
So, I say, "Emelda,
He wants to use you
right now."

1812
01:29:53,562 --> 01:29:56,782
And with Pat Melancon
and Lisa LaVie,

1813
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:59,219
white, black, old, young.

1814
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:01,265
You know, I don'’t have
a college degree.

1815
01:30:01,308 --> 01:30:05,312
But with Pat, we'’re
a hard combination to stop.

1816
01:30:06,139 --> 01:30:08,794
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

1817
01:30:14,626 --> 01:30:18,064
[upbeat music playing]
