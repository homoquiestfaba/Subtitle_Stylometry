So I did.

700
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,863
This time I... I just...

701
01:28:57,865 --> 01:29:00,698
I didn't stop.

702
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:04,269
I just... I didn't stop.

703
01:29:04,271 --> 01:29:06,007
I killed him.

704
01:29:10,677 --> 01:29:13,781
I called Krystof
as soon as it happened.

705
01:29:16,549 --> 01:29:19,152
He never asked why.

706
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:22,890
He just did what he had to do.

707
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:32,133
That kind of love is..
is a rare thing.

708
01:29:37,704 --> 01:29:38,973
Truly...

709
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:41,609
Truly...

710
01:29:43,043 --> 01:29:47,748
I do this for my daughter.
And for Krystof.

711
01:29:52,986 --> 01:29:56,224
This is the only...
the only family I have.

712
01:29:59,726 --> 01:30:03,761
And nothing is going
to get in its way.

713
01:30:03,763 --> 01:30:06,234
Because this is
the best I can be.

714
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,138
I'm sorry.
