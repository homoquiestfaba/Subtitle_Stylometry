00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,016
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:21,557
(laughing)

3
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:30,437
- [Man] Still got it.

4
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:44,130
(intense music)

5
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:09,765
(dog barking)

6
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:10,645
- No, no, no.

7
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:11,695
Stay there, pup.

8
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:15,111
You couldn't keep up with me today.

9
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:17,611
(eerie music)

10
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:48,325
(dramatic music)

11
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,961
Morning.

12
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,544
Nice day, isn't it?

13
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:23,832
- Out of work actor.

14
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,019
(mumbling)

15
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:47,651
(light guitar music)

16
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:54,831
(dark eerie music)

17
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:58,641
That's the stuff.

18
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,845
(clattering)

19
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:25,840
- I'm planning on running myself later.

20
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,805
- Sorry, I didn't think
you'd be up so early.

21
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:29,278
I'll start breakfast.

22
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:31,474
- I can't sleep late even on vacation.

23
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,609
I have this, like,
ingrained sense that there's

24
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,737
something someone forgot to do.

25
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,267
- Well, I'll put a pot of coffee on.

26
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,578
- Oh, I already had coffee,

27
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:40,400
that's very nice.

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,906
I should be leaving soon anyway.

29
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:44,718
I have a lunch date in Knoxville at noon.

30
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:47,214
He is six-foot and a realtor

31
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:49,644
and he has a Cocker Spaniel.

32
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,373
We met on the internet.

33
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:54,280
His picture is very handsome.

34
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,113
You're about six-foot.

35
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,174
- Yeah.

36
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:01,598
Gonna need to give
yourself about two hours

37
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:03,748
to get through the Tail of the Dragon.

38
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:04,581
- Alright.

39
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:05,414
- Sunny side up?

40
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:06,747
- Mm.
- Alright.

41
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,833
- [Voice Machine] You
have no new messages.

42
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,127
♫ A fly stuck on the wall, wall

43
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,995
♫ Down the hall

44
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,769
- Damn, forgot the cumin.

00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,970
♫ The throwing the pillow

00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:45,370
♫ I put down the top, I drive the car

53
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,537
♫ To the left, to the right, stand up

00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:52,826

55
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:53,929
- I'll be right in.

56
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,390
- Hey, you getting a connection?

57
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,821
- Well, I do today.

58
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:57,654
It's a good thing,

59
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:59,722
'cause I can approve these invoices.

60
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:02,947
People want to get paid, imagine that.

61
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:04,903
- Well, your breakfast is on the table.

62
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:05,736
I'll be up in the cabin,

63
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:08,205
just give me a buzz on the
intercom if you need anything.

64
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:09,372
- Ooh ah lamb.

65
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,979
(man chuckling)

66
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,479
(light music)

67
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:23,572
(pills rattling)

68
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:29,102
(phone ringing)

69
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:30,529
- Blue Waters, good morning.

70
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,034
- [Man] Hey baby, how's Appalachia?

71
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:33,280
- Andy.

72
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,989
God, I have been trying to
reach for you three days.

73
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:36,943
You're still coming, right?

74
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,429
- [Andy] Yeah, I'm headed
to my Atlanta flight,

75
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:39,941
plane gets in at two,

76
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,315
should be there by four.

77
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:43,151
- Yeah, maybe five.

78
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:46,306
Hey, um, how long can you stay?

79
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,384
- [Boy] Hey, you were a stray once, too,

80
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:48,404
weren't you, boy?

81
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:49,675
- [Man] People in these parts shoot first

82
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:52,189
and ask questions later.

83
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,640
- You look more like you're
going to a beauty shop

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,431
than the shooting range.

85
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,163
Besides, bet you don't
even know how to use

86
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,742
that gun you keep tucked away.

87
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:00,992
Here, try this.

88
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:05,806
Oh no, not for you.

89
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:10,409
Good, huh?

90
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,553
Recreational materials.

91
00:06:16,553 --> 00:06:18,348
A little hair color.

92
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:19,181
Who are you trying to impress,

93
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:20,014
what's her name?

94
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:23,143
- Oh, no I've got friends
visiting this weekend.

95
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:24,348
- You need a pipe?

96
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,015
Just another twenty.

97
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:28,523
Thought you said you
landed here on the run,

98
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:29,863
and I was your only friend.

99
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:31,609
- Is friendship what we're calling it now?

100
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:32,708
- Yes, sir.

101
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,677
Now I got me friends in high places.

102
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:38,402
- My state of mind, not state of being.

103
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:40,152
- Nah, you're the man.

104
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:42,897
I'd kill for this life you
got here, Grady Wilson.

105
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:43,890
I can't even scrape together enough

106
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,419
to get my bike out the shop.

107
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,883
- Hope this helps.

108
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:48,656
- It will, I guess.

109
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:49,732
I'd sure appreciate it if you got

110
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:52,383
some work I could do around here.

111
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,550
- Business is bad, Beetle.

112
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,593
Your mom toss you out again?

113
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:59,068
- Something like that.

114
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:02,039
Occupational hazard, I guess.

115
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,184
You know, I'd do anything else if I could.

116
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:05,186
A lot I could do if someone would just

117
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:06,760
give me a chance.

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,359
But I'd be real good
at the hotel business.

119
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,356
I'll work real cheap like before.

120
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:13,390
(eerie music)

121
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,987
- Okay, do rooms five and nine.

122
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:19,131
Vacuum, dust, sweep the
front porch and the lobby,

123
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:21,043
pay you for half a day.

124
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:24,336
- Whole weekend and a bed to sleep in.

125
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:26,449
- What, you're negotiating?

126
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,195
- Maybe a little.

127
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,633
Whole day's pay plus a bed,

128
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:31,982
and I'm yours for the weekend.

129
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:33,452
- Plus look after the
kitchen for a little?

130
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,964
- I ain't so good at dishes.

131
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:38,036
- (chuckles) You'll learn.

132
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:41,369
Half day, room and board, out on Monday.

133
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:46,369
(Grady whistles)

134
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,895
(dark mystery music)

135
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,979
(light guitar music)

136
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,542
- Excuse me.

137
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,789
I thought you checked out already.

138
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,356
- Who are you?

139
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:21,711
- I'm Beetle.

140
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,961
I'm just helping out today.

141
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,572
- That's nice.

142
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:41,709
- Male cardinal's got
hellfire's belly, I tell ya.

143
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:45,327
Hangs around birds, all
kinds of other birds.

144
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:46,786
And for some reason he never let's another

145
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:50,413
of his own kind nest anywhere near.

146
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:51,362
See this one male cardinal

147
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:53,945
chasing the other tree to tree?

148
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:57,536
That shrill sound is anger.

149
00:08:57,536 --> 00:09:01,467
Pure fury on account
that he was here first.

150
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,474
Look at him drowning out the other, yeah.

151
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:07,013
Hollerin' and chasin' and
chasin' and hollerin'.

152
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,183
Now when he wins, and he will,

153
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,835
on account of he won't stop 'til he does,

154
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:13,965
he'll return to this here favorite tree,

155
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,076
his feathers all puffed up,

156
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,213
and they'll sing him a victory song.

157
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:19,213
- What will he have won?

158
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:23,246
- A place of his own for a while, I guess.

159
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:24,079
- Alone?

160
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,838
How do you know so much about birds?

161
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:32,485
- Grandfather told me some stuff once.

162
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,402
I guess it kinda stuck.

163
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:40,090
Hey, you can spare me some money, right?

164
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,243
I gotta get my bike from the mechanic,

165
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:43,493
I'm still, like, 200 short.

166
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,472
- You want money from me?

167
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:51,827
- Yes, ma'am. I do.

168
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:57,692
(dark eerie music)

169
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:13,372
(engine revving)

170
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:17,647
(dark mystery music)

171
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,979
- [Man] We're going every
conceivable direction at once.

172
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:32,836
How is this possible?

173
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:34,539
- You know Sophie would
be perfect for the part.

174
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:35,430
You're not alone in loving her,

175
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,536
there's a lot of interest,

176
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,277
but your back-end points are insulting,

177
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:40,898
and I'm gonna need to see
another zero on that base.

178
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:41,731
Listen, Bear, why don't you

179
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,819
just think about it overnight, okay?

180
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,920
I know you're trying to
catch a plan to Mer, Bear?

181
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,837
I lost him.

182
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,131
Hey, the road splits ahead, what do I do?

183
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:54,772
- Arrive here.

184
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:55,775
- What?

185
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:58,108
That doesn't make any sense.

186
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:03,856
I just, this visiting Grady.

187
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:06,016
- Grady's doing fine.

188
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,284
- Then I don't know if I have it in me

189
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:09,186
to do this all over again.

190
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:10,619
I swear, sometimes I
feel like we should just

191
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:12,764
cut our losses and run.

192
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:15,514
(rhythmic music)

193
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,246
- Grady.
- What?

194
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:31,079
- You got a little problem here.

195
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,885
The john in nine is
clogged and overflowin'.

196
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,128
- Did you try a plunger?

197
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,124
- I tried everything I could think.

198
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:37,386
- Jesus Christ.

199
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:39,469
- That's a nice reaction.

200
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:43,867
You know Arlis, right?

201
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:44,851
- No.

202
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,235
- He's my bud, I'll call him for you.

203
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:47,068
- Is he a plumber?

204
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,161
- Yeah, he's a plumber.

205
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,268
Best in town.

206
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:50,581
Probably the whole county.

207
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,196
- Oh God, I still need
to run and get eggs,

208
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,684
Rye and Karen are gonna
be here at any minute.

209
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:56,249
- Go ahead, I'll call him for you.

210
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,338
I'll hook you up.

211
00:11:57,338 --> 00:11:58,671
I got your back.

212
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:02,423
- I sure am sorry to hear
about your mom, Beetle.

213
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,340
- [Beetle] Thanks, Arlis.

214
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,947
(toilet gurgling)

215
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:06,780
- Got it.

216
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,446
- What's that?

217
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:13,764
- Looks like a pair of panties.

218
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,514
Ladies' pink panties.

219
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,736
- How you suppose that got down there?

220
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,137
- Well, you won't believe
the kind of things

221
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:22,220
I find in people's pipes.

222
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:24,975
Once found a cat.

223
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,499
(register whirring)

224
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,822
- Just put it on my account,

225
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,147
my name's Grady Wilson.

226
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:35,620
- I know who you are, Mr. Wilson.

227
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,205
- Oh.

228
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:39,155
I get a little carried away in my head,

229
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:40,337
I've got a lot going on,

230
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,483
and I forget to be courteous, I'm sorry.

231
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:43,901
- It's okay, just 'cause
you see some smoke

232
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,359
doesn't mean that there's a fire.

233
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,870
- Excuse me?

234
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,001
- We take things in stride
in these parts, Mr. Wilson,

235
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,334
you'll catch on.

236
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:53,344
- Yes.

237
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:55,782
Have a good day.

238
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,762
- [Arlis] I'm used to getting paid

239
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:01,758
when I finish a job, you know?

240
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:04,118
- Oh, I know, but he ain't here.

241
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,858
I don't know where he's at.

242
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll ask Grady to drop off your pay

243
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,750
as soon as I see him.

244
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:12,854
You know, with all these rooms,

245
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,450
he's like to need a plumber more often.

246
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,305
You want us to hook you up?

247
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:20,838
- What exactly you got in mind, son?

248
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:24,501
- Just saying, you scratch
my back I'll scratch yours.

249
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:25,537
- What are we talking about here,

250
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,687
a twice-a-year snake job?

251
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,211
- Every other week, snakes and more.

252
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:32,232
At least as long as I'm here.

253
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:35,132
I can't get by on what folks
like Grady Wilson will pay.

254
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:38,214
I imagine it's tough on you, too.

255
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:40,131
I'm just saying, look around.

256
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:41,550
He's doing just fine.

257
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,603
It's you and me who's
getting the short end,

258
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,603
if you know what I mean.

259
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:51,635
- That's my beer money for the weekend.

260
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:54,160
You best make it worth my while.

261
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,824
- You have my word, Arlis.

262
00:13:55,824 --> 00:13:59,907
Hey, you're adding that
into your cost, ain't ya?

263
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,443
(dark mystery music)

264
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:30,866
- I want a different birth sign.

265
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:31,996
- You mean like astrology?

266
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,183
- Yeah, I just don't get along

267
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:35,357
with other Sagittariuses.

268
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,263
They're too fussy

269
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:38,530
and focused on one thing at a time.

270
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,805
And they take themselves
way too seriously.

271
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,297
- [Rye] Who else is a Sagittarius?

272
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:44,678
- [Karen] Grady.

273
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:45,836
- [Rye] I mean, like anyone famous?

274
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:48,768
- [Karen] Oh, um, Jim Morrison.

275
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:49,768
Jane Austin.

276
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:53,514
- I don't know that I would necessarily

277
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:55,514
want those two together.

278
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,112
What would you be?

279
00:14:58,112 --> 00:14:59,304
Gemini?

280
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,833
- [Karen] No, they're too passive.

281
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,333
- I'm not passive.

282
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:06,978
(eerie music)

283
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:15,553
(footsteps clattering)

284
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:16,892
- Oh my God.

285
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:17,962
This is gorgeous!

286
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,462
A big improvement.

287
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,468
- [Rye] Grady!

288
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:23,689
There he is.

289
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,551
Nice to see you, man.

290
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,943
- Thank you for coming.

291
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:30,177
You have no idea how much I've missed you.

292
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:31,986
- It's good to see you smiling.

293
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:33,576
- I've got an amazing
dinner planned for tonight

294
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,688
and a surprise guest.

295
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,432
- Oh, I've missed your cooking.

296
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,542
- [Rye] Who's the surprise guest?

297
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,262
- It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you.

298
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:41,095
- [Rye] Come on, Grady, you know can't

299
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:42,870
keep a secret, man.

300
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,662
- It's Andy.

301
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:45,495
- What?

302
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:46,690
- Andy's coming!

303
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,523
- [Rye] When?

304
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:48,403
- Like now!

305
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:49,485
It's gonna be the four of us

306
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,923
together again just like old times.

307
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:54,917
- I need to use the bathroom, oh!

308
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:55,750
Hello.

309
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,621
- Good afternoon.

310
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:57,619
I'm Beetle.

311
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:58,548
Room nine, right?

312
00:15:58,548 --> 00:15:59,605
- That's Beetle.

313
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:00,942
- Beetle, I'm Rye, this is my wife, Karen.

314
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,311
- Pleasure.

315
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,133
I'm gonna get these things to your room.

316
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,978
And I'll fix something to drink.

317
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,383
- [Rye] Oh, you're the man, Beetle.

318
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,776
Cold beer when you get a chance.

319
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:10,776
- Ah, no, I'll get that.

320
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,196
- This room's my personal favorite.

321
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:17,784
It's got the best view of the lake.

322
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:20,451
And a jacuzzi hot tub with jets.

323
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,787
- Oh, nah, I can't take money from you.

324
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:26,823
- Yes, you can.

325
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:28,522
- Think of this as your home.

326
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,469
Just let me know if you
need anything, ma'am.

327
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,030
- Ma'am?

328
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,627
Please, I'm not that old.

329
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,331
- No disrespect intended.

330
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:38,098
I call every young lady over 20 ma'am.

331
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,431
You are over 20?

332
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,851
- Pile it on, kid.

333
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:45,478
You know, with your Southern
charm and those looks,

334
00:16:45,478 --> 00:16:47,895
I bet you're quite a handful.

335
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,083
(dark eerie music)

336
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:59,702
(relaxing music)

337
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:04,460
- [Rye] Blue Waters Scrabble Championship.

338
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,293
- I think most of them awards

339
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:07,430
are from the previous owners.

340
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,296
- Everybody come in here and
walk away with something?

341
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,780
- Pretty much, I guess.

342
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,689
- What about you?

343
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:13,522
- Not yet.

344
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,281
- You and Grady close?

345
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,453
- Yes, sir, I like to think so.

346
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:22,540
- Is he doing okay here?

347
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,322
Is he happy?

348
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:26,879
- He gets by about the
best he can, I suppose.

349
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,040
- Is he making any friends in town?

350
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,659
- Suspect it takes a
local some time to warm up

351
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:35,826
depending on how a new person
presents himself and all.

352
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,927
- I worry about him.

353
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:42,145
I imagine it's pretty
lonely here in the winter.

354
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,478
- Indeed, it is.

355
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:46,253
Sounds like you're good buds.

356
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:49,336
- Yeah, you know, good times and bad.

357
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:54,124
- Grady has some bad times, has he?

358
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:01,483
If I may be so bold,

359
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,442
did something bad happen to Grady?

360
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,435
I've often suspected that

361
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,551
maybe what drove him out--
- Hey.

362
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:10,592
Let's just say we all went through

363
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:12,297
a bit of recovery period, alright?

364
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:14,400
Leave it at that.

365
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,317
(dark eerie music)

366
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,611
- This carrot will perhaps just
thwart off my pending buzz.

367
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:26,312
(chuckling)

368
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:27,639
I wasn't so sure that you and Andy

369
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,292
were on good terms these days.

370
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,709
- No, no, no, no, we're good.

371
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,196
- Says you or says he?

372
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,446
- Well, both of us, I hope.

373
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,004
I'm gonna ask him to move in.

374
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:43,004
I want us to be married.

375
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,103
(chuckles) In sentiment if not in law.

376
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:49,600
It is North Carolina after all.

377
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,850
Oh, I want you to see this.

378
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,179
- Aw, Grady.

379
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,723
- Perhaps the feelings that we experienced

380
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:01,804
when we were in love
represent a normal state.

381
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:03,709
- [Karen] Being in love shows a person

382
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,701
who he should be.

383
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,683
- You remember your Russian lit.

384
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:08,523
- Of course I do.

385
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,944
Mr. Kitrich was hot.

386
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:13,861
- Mm yeah, he was. (chuckling)

387
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,248
- It's really nice.

388
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:22,415
I just hope that Andy can
see the person he should be.

389
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:33,266
Why is it that all the men in my life

390
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:35,638
have a problem facing reality?

391
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:36,574
- Did you say something?

392
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:37,627
- Beetle.

393
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:38,887
A chef requires more wine,

394
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,628
and I need another martini.

395
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:41,708
Very dry.

396
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,735
- That's number two.

397
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:43,970
- I can count, don't worry.

398
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,106
- Wouldn't worry.

399
00:19:45,106 --> 00:19:46,615
Bet mama don't burn the grits.

400
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:48,804
- Oh, I love the regional vernacular.

401
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,316
Oh, I sound condescending,
I don't mean to be,

402
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,527
it's just that I have this

403
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:54,627
fascination for colloquialisms.

404
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,834
You from around here?

405
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,403
- Born and raised less
than two miles away.

406
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:59,641
- [Karen] I bet you're
close with your family.

407
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:01,250
- Sometimes a little closer in proximity

408
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,316
than I'd like, I suppose.

409
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,667
- I bet it's a big family,

410
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:07,855
and your dad is the kind, dedicated type

411
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:10,372
who would work a second job?

412
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:13,775
- Actually, Ms. Karen, my pop's dead.

413
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,111
Or so I'm told.

414
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:17,526
No other kids, just me.

415
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:19,055
- Beetle.

416
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,163
Don't mind Karen over here.

417
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:21,388
She's sure she has a keen ability

418
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,730
to sum up all the little bits

419
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,313
and pieces of stranger's lives.

420
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,403
- Alright then.

421
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:29,877
Try me.

422
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,398
Try again.

423
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,815
- Your mom, she was the independent type.

424
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,265
She had to shelve a few big dreams

425
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:41,100
to focus on the materiality
of raising a son on her own.

426
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,160
- Actually, mom's got the bipolar.

427
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,223
Sweet as pie one second,

428
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,996
raising the steeple the next.

429
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,391
She had a waitress job once.

430
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,130
Got so worked up on a customer,

431
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,917
she threw a pot of scowlin' coffee at him.

432
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,911
They let her go.

433
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:58,791
- Alright, you have a girlfriend.

434
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,167
- It's not working out so
good this week, actually.

435
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,317
- You went to high school.

436
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:04,319
- K through 12. Yes, ma'am.

437
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,500
- You did well?

438
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,606
- Mostly.

439
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:08,650
Feels a little like the
law's coming down on me.

440
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,789
Did I pass?

441
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:11,713
- You did, I did horribly, though.

442
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:15,046
- Yeah, she's usually much, much better.

443
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:20,825
- No, there is something.

444
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:23,578
There's a certain quality about you.

445
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:25,006
You know who you remind me of?

446
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:26,846
A younger version of Rye.

447
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:29,679
Doesn't he have a similar persona?

448
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:31,557
- No.

449
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:37,977
Rumor has it you require more wine.

450
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:41,477
- No, rumor has it you require sweet buds.

451
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:44,096
- Grady, you're a good man.

452
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,284
- [Grady] Mm-hmm.

453
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,204
- What ya cookin'?

454
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:49,863
- Glazed carrots, a
little bit of orange zest,

455
00:21:49,863 --> 00:21:50,855
a little bit of agave,

456
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:52,420
it's gonna be real good.

457
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,997
Mm-hmm, you hungry?

458
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:54,830
- Yes, sir.

459
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,233
- Come on, don't take one!

460
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,733
- You reading Oscar Wilde?

461
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:00,877
- [Beetle] Trying to.

462
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:02,377
- It's one of my favorites.

463
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:03,256
- Yeah?

464
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:04,388
Maybe you can help me then.

465
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:07,213
I have a little trouble
understanding this right here.

466
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:09,691
- [Karen] Read it to me.

467
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:10,524
- Alright.

468
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:15,552
"It is better not to be
different from one's fellows,

469
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,771
"the ugly and the stupid

470
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:19,554
"have the best of it in this world.

471
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:21,811
"For if they know nothing of victory,

472
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:25,080
"they are at least spared
the knowledge of defeat.

473
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,318
"Shall all suffer terribly

474
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:29,151
"for what the gods have given us?"

475
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:34,560
- I think you understand that just fine.

476
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,393
- Anyway.

477
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,677
What about you, Ms. Karen?

478
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,809
- What about me, Mr. Beetle?

479
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:42,642
I'm gonna need you to be

480
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:45,740
a little more specific with your question.

481
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,323
- Well, tell me about your job.

482
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:52,148
- [Karen] What do you think I do?

483
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:53,731
- Alright, I get it.

484
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:56,639
God, I won't be much good
at this game, though.

485
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,806
You work behind the scenes

486
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:02,335
in the entertainment industry.

487
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:06,992
- Yes.

488
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:08,659
I am a talent agent.

489
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:14,827
- And I bet you got a lot
of fancy university degrees.

490
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:18,096
You go to school for something like that.

491
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,219
- Not a prerequisite.

492
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:23,386
But this one did with a
master's in political science.

493
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:26,342
- But it takes a lot more than

494
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:29,293
education or hard work
to get where you're at.

495
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:30,184
- Yes, dear Beetle,

496
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:32,644
I scratched and clawed my way

497
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,660
through the assistant's pool and I waited.

498
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,621
- And what do we wait for?

499
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:42,348
- We waited for someone to die

500
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:46,621
or have a breakdown or
screw up and get fired.

501
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:48,404
All the above.

502
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:50,737
Anything for an opportunity.

503
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:55,323
To win big somebody else
has got to lose big.

504
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:58,240
(mysterious music)

505
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:14,797
- Karen.

506
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:16,475
- Hi, Andy.

507
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,308
- Wow.

508
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:20,128
What a great surprise,

509
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:22,496
I didn't know I was gonna
get to see you this weekend.

510
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:24,199
Funny, I was just thinking about you,

511
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:26,449
meaning to call, how's Rye?

512
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,163
- Rye's in the kitchen with Grady.

513
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:30,613
You can go ask him yourself.

514
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:31,446
- Hello.

515
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:32,598
I'm Andy.

516
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:34,479
- Something from the bar for you, sir?

517
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,312
- Sir.

518
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:39,140
Jack on the rocks if you got it stocked.

519
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,035
- We're so stocked back here,

520
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:42,212
it's fixin' to fall a flood.

521
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:43,884
- This is Beetle.

522
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:46,900
He's the newest member
of the Blue Water staff.

523
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,274
Not only does he have
the ear and intuition

524
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:51,145
of a great bartender,

525
00:24:51,145 --> 00:24:52,473
he is, in my opinion,

526
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:53,649
the keystone for the future success

527
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:55,675
of our little venture.

528
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:57,122
- Hm.

529
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,289
Well, awesome.

530
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:02,782
What kind of a name is Beetle anyway?

531
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:05,697
- Just my nickname as a kid.

532
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:07,048
Guess it kinda stuck.

533
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,541
- Yes, I guess it did.

534
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,374
- Beetle.

535
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,089
So help me out.

536
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:14,874
Where the hell can I get
cell phone reception?

537
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:16,594
- Your best bet's probably
out front of the lodge,

538
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:18,073
on the road above the deck.

539
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,517
- Cool.

540
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,350
Thanks.

541
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:25,075
Well, I better run and say my hellos.

542
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:36,782
- What you mean "our venture?"

543
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:39,379
Are you an investor here or something?

544
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:41,361
- Does anything get by you?

545
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:42,910
- I hope not.

546
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,904
- Yes, I am a silent investor, we all are.

547
00:25:46,904 --> 00:25:50,159
But let's just keep it silent, okay?

548
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,006
- Mom's the word.

549
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:53,006
- Grady! Hi!

550
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,000
I, um...

551
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,061
I didn't know you and Karen

552
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:00,866
were gonna be here, Rye.

553
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:02,503
- Surprises abound.

554
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:05,073
I guess I could say the same for you.

555
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:07,740
- Listen, I have to make a call.

556
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:10,911
Work.

557
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:11,744
- Yeah.

558
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:14,359
Remember to try out front by the lake.

559
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,584
- I know.

560
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:16,834
Beetle told me.

561
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:19,431
He's got me covered.

562
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:21,645
- Beetle's got Andy covered.

563
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:24,440
- Beetle's got a lot of things covered.

564
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,679
- I actually feel sorry for him.

565
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,621
(door creaks)

566
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,964
- Mm.

567
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,562
What has Grady told you about us?

568
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:35,164
- Well, nothing, but I
guess he cares about you,

569
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:37,225
just 'cause he's got to impress.

570
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:38,354
- Why do you say that?

571
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:40,196
- Well, he's been
exercising like a crazy man.

572
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:42,946
And well, yeah, I can't tell you.

573
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:47,059
- Well, you started,
now you have to finish.

574
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,551
- Well, he even dyed the gray

575
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:50,183
out of his hair this morning.

576
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:51,046
- Really?

577
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:52,546
Grady's gone gray.

578
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:56,848
- What?

579
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,732
- Oh, nothing.

580
00:26:57,732 --> 00:26:59,232
No, it looks good.

581
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:01,569
- Beetle.

582
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,236
Go stir the carrots.

583
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:07,134
- Let's go shoot some pool.

584
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:10,051
(dark eerie music)

585
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:16,138
(sizzling)

586
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:30,504
- Hey baby, it's me.

587
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:31,931
Sorry I missed you.

588
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:33,799
Cell phone reception sucks here.

589
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:34,962
I'm standing in the middle of a road

590
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:36,891
in front of a lake below a mountain,

591
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:40,687
it's like the only place my
phone will work. (chuckles)

592
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:41,604
Crazy, huh?

593
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:46,070
Listen, I should probably stay over

594
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,580
and catch a morning plane.

595
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:53,736
I know that's not what we talked about,

596
00:27:53,736 --> 00:27:57,708
but I'll be out of here
tomorrow, I love you.

597
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,708
(calm guitar music)

598
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:04,867
- Phone work?

599
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,184
- Yeah, thanks.

600
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:13,963
You know...

601
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:20,553
You look so good.

602
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:23,609
And this place is--

603
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:25,146
- Thanks.

604
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:26,879
- Is that tapestry new?

605
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:27,712
- Yeah.

606
00:28:28,782 --> 00:28:30,796
- What's with you?

607
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:31,629
- Nothing.

608
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:33,339
Why?

609
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,922
- It's not nothing, what is it?

610
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,110
- Let's talk later.

611
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,723
- Later?

612
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:43,556
- Yeah, when it's just you and me.

613
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:51,577
- You're seeing somebody else, aren't you?

614
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,166
You didn't come here to visit,

615
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,997
you came here to break up.

616
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,045
That's what you've been,

617
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:03,216
that's why you've been avoiding my calls.

618
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:05,353
- I'm a horrible person.

619
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:08,206
Please understand that I,

620
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,643
I don't want to hurt you.

621
00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:12,057
- You can't do this to me now.

622
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,891
I'm so alone here, I need you.

623
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:16,526
- Baby, baby, baby, I hear you.

624
00:29:16,526 --> 00:29:19,119
Grady, I hear you, I do.

625
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,335
But it doesn't work for you in the city,

626
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:22,502
and I can't live out here.

627
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:28,158
I love you, but what do you,

628
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:31,688
what do you expect me to do, Grady?

629
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,855
(slow dramatic music)

630
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,237
- Andy.

631
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:24,070
(grunts)

632
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,507
I know you have some trouble
controlling your impulses,

633
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:26,707
but how could you not even tell him

634
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:28,622
that you're seeing somebody?

635
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:29,842
Grady's fragile.

636
00:30:29,842 --> 00:30:31,565
- Oh, come on.

637
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,557
He's not gonna break.

638
00:30:33,557 --> 00:30:35,362
I wanted to see him in person

639
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:38,419
and talk face to face in private.

640
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,261
- But you put me in a
really awkward position.

641
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:41,094
- Uh!

642
00:30:41,094 --> 00:30:42,173
I didn't intend to do anything to you,

643
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,877
I didn't even know you were gonna be here!

644
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:45,870
What, you want me to just go, I will.

645
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,562
- You'll do what you need to.

646
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:48,477
You always do.

647
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:51,415
(balls click)

648
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:52,998
- Karen, seriously,

649
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:57,415
you are one of the most intelligent,

650
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:58,794
beautiful women I know.

651
00:30:58,794 --> 00:31:00,432
It kills me to see you this angry.

652
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:01,679
- Don't even, Andy.

653
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,332
Your bullshit is completely transparent,

654
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:04,532
and I don't trust you.

655
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:06,387
- Oh, don't start in on trust with me,

656
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:09,578
'cause if it weren't for your, uh, deceit,

657
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,891
none of Grady's mess would've gone down.

658
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:14,137
- [Karen] That's a low blow.

659
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:14,970
- [Rye] Is something burning?

660
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,116
- [Andy] Manny Knowles, Karen.

661
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:19,396
You destroyed Grady.

662
00:31:19,396 --> 00:31:20,761
- [Karen] Fuck you, Andy.

663
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:21,863
- [Andy] Own your guilt, Karen!

664
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,475
- [Karen] Show some responsibility.

665
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:24,588
- [Andy] What do you think I'm doing?

666
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:25,481
- [Karen] I don't know, when you left,

667
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:26,977
you went to New York, Grady's out here.

668
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:27,845
- [Rye] Serious, something's burning!

669
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:28,944
- [Karen] You totally deserted him!

670
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:30,004
- [Andy] What are you doing here?

671
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:31,192
- [Karen] I don't know
what I'm doing here--

672
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:32,320
- [Andy] Exactly!

673
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,933
- Everything alright around here?

674
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,808
- There's smoke.

675
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:36,048
- [Karen] You're making
a mess out of everything!

676
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:36,881
- [Andy] It wouldn't have been a mess

677
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:37,714
if you wouldn't have been here.

678
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:41,106
(confused chatter)

679
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:44,023
(mysterious music)

680
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,718
(alarm blaring)

681
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:50,665
Shoot.

682
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:53,514
- [Rye] Grady!

683
00:31:53,514 --> 00:31:56,169
- [Andy] Disconnect it from the box!

684
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:57,461
The box!

685
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:58,794
- What happened?

686
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:02,141
My lamb vindaloo!

687
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,106
- Which food do you mean,

688
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:05,356
charred beyond recognition?

689
00:32:06,194 --> 00:32:07,027
- That noise.

690
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:09,915
Can someone turn that off?

691
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:10,748
(alarm stops)

692
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:11,721
- Mama don't burn the grits,

693
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,554
but papa's got issues.

694
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:18,510
- Got them set about 500
degrees, who did this?

695
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,510
It's ruined!

696
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:23,635
Why can't I do anything right?

697
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:29,149
(Rye coughing)

698
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:31,899
(rhythmic music)

699
00:32:40,314 --> 00:32:43,794
- This orange-colored rice
is really, really good.

700
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:46,294
(eerie music)

701
00:32:50,706 --> 00:32:54,175
(utensil clinks)

702
00:32:54,175 --> 00:32:56,988
- Sweetheart, are you okay?

703
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:58,738
- No. No, not really.

704
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,077
I don't know what's going on.

705
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,170
You know, I'm glad you're all here,

706
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,720
but I'm not feeling very well,

707
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,470
so I'm gonna turn in.

708
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,455
(knocking on door)

709
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:23,788
Come in, Beetle.

710
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:28,768
- It's chicken soup.

711
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:30,611
I found it in your deep freeze.

712
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,472
You made it, so it must be good.

713
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:33,878
- [Grady] I'm not hungry.

714
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,928
- You didn't eat dinner.

715
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:38,852
I thought you might could
drink a cup of soup.

716
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,417
What ya doing?

717
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,463
- [Grady] Watching.

718
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:43,712
- Watching what?

719
00:33:43,712 --> 00:33:45,462
- [Grady] Everything.

720
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,954
- Well, I hope you feel real better soon.

721
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:50,621
- [Grady] Thank you.

722
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,740
(eerie music intensifies)

723
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,955
- Took him some soup,

724
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:10,804
don't know if he's gonna eat, but I tried.

725
00:34:10,804 --> 00:34:11,801
- What's he doing?

726
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:12,938
- Watching us.

727
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:13,796
- Watching us?

728
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:16,379
- On the surveillance monitors.

729
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:19,671
- You like working here?

730
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,809
- Happy to have a job,

731
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,103
especially these days.

732
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,267
Guess you know what I mean.

733
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:25,345
I bet Ms. Tammy and the others

734
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:27,378
wish they hadn't have quit.

735
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:28,850
- Who's Ms. Tammy?

736
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,025
- Oh, she was the last housekeeper.

737
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:33,442
- Why'd she quit?

738
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:37,496
- Suspect she didn't like him
watching her all the time.

739
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:39,370
He'd holler down at her over the intercom

740
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:43,537
if something wasn't dusted
or moved wrong or worse.

741
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:48,699
- You know Grady, he's
particular about things.

742
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,354
I guess that's what makes
him good at his job.

743
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:53,117
(dishes clanging)

744
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:55,002
You do think Grady's
good at his job, right?

745
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:56,002
- I suppose.

746
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,389
Hey Rye, wait.

747
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,478
I'd really like it if we could be friends.

748
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,454
I know you probably think I'm just some

749
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:06,515
silly small-town kid.

750
00:35:06,515 --> 00:35:07,348
But I got a lot to offer,

751
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:10,580
I just don't get a chance to show it much.

752
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,635
All I want's a chance, you know?

753
00:35:12,635 --> 00:35:17,001
A job and maybe a new friend
with a different perspective.

754
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,286
- Sure, Beetle.

755
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:21,286
I don't see why we can't be friends.

756
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:27,471
- [TV Announcer] You're
gonna need to do more

757
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:30,403
than a cleaning with this old girl.

758
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,385
Not if you want to keep your house.

759
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:36,940
She gets fire in it more
than your fireplace can.

760
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,603
(Karen groaning)

761
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,217
You can salvage lumber
from your historic home,

762
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:43,418
tailor-made to fit in your room.

763
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:46,305
- Can you, I'm watching that.

764
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:49,057
- You're watching a home show
on fireplace restoration.

765
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:51,654
- I was listening to it.

766
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:54,598
- I didn't know you were awake.

767
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:56,248
- I don't have my sleeping pills.

768
00:35:56,248 --> 00:35:58,081
I forgot to pack them.

769
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:02,829
You shouldn't eat after 10.

770
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,357
- I was talking with Beetle.

771
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:07,107
- In the kitchen with a sandwich?

772
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:09,579
He's a nice guy.

773
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:13,594
- We kind of have similar
personas, don't you think?

774
00:36:13,594 --> 00:36:15,510
- Please, he's a child.

775
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,597
And I like men.

776
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:17,764
Well, one man.

777
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:20,774
What's wrong?

778
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:24,975
- Beetle claims all the
employees here have quit.

779
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,421
He says Grady sits upstairs all day

780
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:28,786
watching the surveillance monitor.

781
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,227
And every time the
employees do something wrong

782
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:31,998
he comes down and yells at them.

783
00:36:31,998 --> 00:36:33,252
- Grady wouldn't sit around

784
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:35,627
watching a surveillance monitor.

785
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,850
Would he?

786
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,998
- I don't know.

787
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:40,077
But this cable package kind of stinks.

788
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:42,019
- I just hope he doesn't
hit us up for more cash.

789
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:43,149
This place could become a money pit,

790
00:36:43,149 --> 00:36:46,852
I mean more than what
it really already is.

791
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:50,911
You know, I already put
60.000 into this place?

792
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:54,762
We can't just let him
run it into the ground,

793
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:56,477
now, can we?

794
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:58,002
You know, I had to take
a loss in the first two,

795
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:01,421
and we could deduct 100% of investment.

796
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,771
- That's good then, right?

797
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:04,854
- Yeah, well it could be.

798
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,023
- Did you tell Beetle I was out of work?

799
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:09,748
- [Karen] No, I wouldn't do that.

800
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,593
Why do you ask?

801
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:13,694
- Something he said implied that he knew.

802
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:15,527
- He's very intuitive.

803
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:19,532
- That borders on psychic behavior.

804
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:22,208
- Maybe Grady said something.

805
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:24,563
- Yeah, must be it.

806
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:26,879
He needs to keep that mouth shut.

807
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:29,292
And mind his own freaking business.

808
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:30,597
(Rye groans)

809
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:32,273
- [TV Announcer] See if we
can't find a new mantle.

810
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:33,106
- Night.

811
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:34,363
- [TV Announcer] Removing
stains and clean up

812
00:37:34,363 --> 00:37:36,546
this whole marble kit, clean up the--

813
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,879
(loud thud)

814
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:50,717
(yawns)
- Excuse me.

815
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:51,928
Excuse me.

816
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:53,845
No towels in room five.

817
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,451
- [Andy] Sorry.

818
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:58,618
- You're fine.

819
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:00,763
Night now.

820
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:06,630
- Night!

821
00:38:07,965 --> 00:38:10,465
(light music)

822
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:49,823
(mysterious music)

823
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,995
(floor creaking)

824
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:12,860
- [Beetle] What's the matter, can't sleep?

825
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,467
- What?

826
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:17,037
(chuckling)

827
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:18,791
- So you can't sleep either?

828
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:22,482
- No, I was just going to
the kitchen for a snack.

829
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,482
- Want to smoke a joint?

830
00:39:30,476 --> 00:39:34,643
You ever think Grady could
get like he was before?

831
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:37,338
- What do you mean?

832
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,421
- You know, the incident.

833
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,771
- You know about that?

834
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:43,771
- Yes, I do.

835
00:39:47,232 --> 00:39:50,639
- Well, he's made a lot of progress

836
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,501
since his attempted suicide,

837
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:55,940
and he's been taken care of

838
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,357
by some really great doctors.

839
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:04,654
Don't worry, I'm sure he'll be okay.

840
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,047
- So you were good to stand by him

841
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:10,143
as long as you did.

842
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:12,584
I'd imagine that paranoia and depression

843
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:15,987
must take its toll on a friendship.

844
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:16,987
- I managed.

845
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:19,517
Call me Andy.

846
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:41,159
- I should really get some sleep, Andy.

847
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:51,144
- Yeah, me too.

848
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:57,236
(gentle guitar music)

849
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:05,455
- [Grady] Morning.

850
00:41:20,382 --> 00:41:21,395
- Now I know you have another choice,

851
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,431
there's always another choice,

852
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:25,298
but Sophie is your first choice.

853
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:27,228
No, no, no, we got to
come to terms on this.

854
00:41:27,228 --> 00:41:28,553
No, meet me more than halfway.

855
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:29,696
Let's get this deal out of the sand trap

856
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,793
and onto the putting green.

857
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:33,573
Alright, send me an offer.

858
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:35,490
Alright, you're a doll.

859
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,557
- Got a big one comin'.

860
00:41:39,858 --> 00:41:41,776
- It's fixin' to fall a flood?

861
00:41:41,776 --> 00:41:42,859
- Yes, ma'am.

862
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:45,530
- Come sit with me, Beetle.

863
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,468
- Nah, I shouldn't.

864
00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:48,885
- Have you eaten?

865
00:41:50,303 --> 00:41:52,886
Catch yourself a plate and sit.

866
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,675
So do you like working here, Beetle?

867
00:41:57,675 --> 00:41:59,464
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

868
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:00,563
- Apart from the occasional ones

869
00:42:00,563 --> 00:42:03,480
it gets overly familiar, I suppose.

870
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:06,687
But I love it here,

871
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:07,996
this is a beautiful place.

872
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:09,216
And I'm happy just

873
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:11,160
keeping sure guests are attended to.

874
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,595
- And what to do the customers

875
00:42:13,595 --> 00:42:16,467
and people in town think of Grady?

876
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,078
- It's not really for me to say.

877
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,328
I don't gossip.

878
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:23,538
- I respect that, but it's not gossip.

879
00:42:23,538 --> 00:42:24,788
I'm his friend.

880
00:42:26,116 --> 00:42:26,949
- From what I know,

881
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:30,043
it's friends who gossips most of all.

882
00:42:30,043 --> 00:42:32,222
- You might be right.

883
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:36,422
Regardless, I would like
you to be candid with me.

884
00:42:36,422 --> 00:42:39,349
- Well, I don't know how
things work in the big city.

885
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:43,514
But around here, a man's
reputation is everything.

886
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:46,181
- And how is Grady's reputation?

887
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:50,766
- Look around, there's nobody here.

888
00:42:50,766 --> 00:42:53,016
Not the best, I suppose.

889
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:55,189
(door rattles)

890
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:56,912
- Good morning.

891
00:42:56,912 --> 00:42:58,852
- Every day I see this same woman,

892
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:01,052
and every day she ignores me.

893
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:03,777
Why does that power walking freak hate me?

894
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:06,582
- Maybe because you call
her a power walking freak.

895
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:07,928
- Not to her face.

896
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:09,104
- How ya feeling?

897
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:10,521
- About the same.

898
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:12,941
- Excuse me, Ms. Karen.

899
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:13,812
I better go see if there's anything

900
00:43:13,812 --> 00:43:15,498
he needs me to do.

901
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:18,248
(rhythmic music)

902
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:27,445
- I absolutely cannot focus today.

903
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:28,802
- Ms. Karen asked me to sit with her.

904
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:31,512
I told her I shouldn't, but she insisted.

905
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:33,409
- Oh, that's fine.

906
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:35,034
Is anybody else up?

907
00:43:35,034 --> 00:43:36,297
- Not yet.

908
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:37,397
I don't suppose we'll be seeing Andy

909
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:39,491
for quite some time.

910
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:43,658
I guess he got real friendly
with Mr. Daniels last night.

911
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:47,101
I don't understand it,

912
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:48,698
but if a man wants to
lie with another man,

913
00:43:48,698 --> 00:43:51,615
I suppose it's none of my business.

914
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:54,860
'Til it becomes business.

915
00:43:55,827 --> 00:43:56,888
What I mean to say is,

916
00:43:56,888 --> 00:43:58,456
I ain't comfortable
receiving sexual advances

917
00:43:58,456 --> 00:44:00,123
at my place of work.

918
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:02,594
- What?

919
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:05,343
What? What?

920
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:10,272
(suspenseful music)

921
00:44:15,997 --> 00:44:17,531
Andy!

922
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:18,364
Andy!
(bangs on door)

923
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,158
Get the hell up right now!

924
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,440
- [Andy] Jesus, would
you keep your voice down,

925
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,273
what is it?

926
00:44:22,273 --> 00:44:23,283
- [Grady] You are such a pig.

927
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:24,116
- [Andy] What!?

928
00:44:24,116 --> 00:44:25,297
- [Grady] How could you do that?

929
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:26,916
He is an employee, he's a kid!

930
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,247
- [Andy] Oh, that?

931
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:29,651
Jesus, nothing happened.

932
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:31,784
- [Grady] You put your
hand on my employee's cock

933
00:44:31,784 --> 00:44:33,002
against his will.

934
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:33,887
- [Andy] Against?

935
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:35,464
- [Grady] You are getting
the hell out right now!

936
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,470
- [Andy] Oh, please.

937
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:40,137
He practically waved
it in front of my face!

938
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,111
- If there is a God and he
truly wants to punish someone,

939
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:46,187
he starts by making them mad.

940
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:48,195
- Do you mean furious or insane?

941
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:49,244
- Both.

942
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:51,158
- Andy made a pass at Beetle?

943
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,874
- He practically molested him.

944
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,729
We're gonna be lucky if
Beetle doesn't press charges.

945
00:44:54,729 --> 00:44:56,299
- Beetle wouldn't do that.

946
00:44:56,299 --> 00:44:58,543
- Oh, my head is splitting!

947
00:44:58,543 --> 00:45:01,376
- [Karen] I'll get you some water.

948
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:05,506
- Grady, I want to talk to you.

949
00:45:05,506 --> 00:45:06,546
- How's your back?

950
00:45:06,546 --> 00:45:08,436
Weren't you supposed to be leaving?

951
00:45:08,436 --> 00:45:10,523
- There's a storm coming!

952
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:13,084
Flights out of Atlanta are grounded.

953
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:15,222
- You've got a rental, drive!

954
00:45:15,222 --> 00:45:16,243
- To New York?

955
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:17,076
- Why not?

956
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:19,925
- Grady, please stop.

957
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:20,869
Please stop.

958
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:22,268
- Don't touch me!

959
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:24,134
Is nothing sacred to you?

960
00:45:24,134 --> 00:45:25,103
(choking)
You hate me and you want me

961
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:26,776
to go away, don't you?

962
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:27,609
- [Karen] Grady!

963
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:28,442
- I won't let you get away with it!

964
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:29,532
- [Karen] Grady! Stop!

965
00:45:29,532 --> 00:45:31,126
- What are you all trying to do to me?

966
00:45:31,126 --> 00:45:32,474
- Shh!
- You wanna kill me.

967
00:45:32,474 --> 00:45:33,806
- Grady.

968
00:45:33,806 --> 00:45:36,134
- You want me to die, don't you?

969
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,930
- We don't want you to die.

970
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,351
We don't want you to die.

971
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:41,554
- [Grady] Get off me.

972
00:45:41,554 --> 00:45:43,637
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

973
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:56,696
(music slows down)

974
00:46:04,955 --> 00:46:07,372
- Is there anymore breakfast?

975
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:16,885
- Okay, I can't stand by

976
00:46:16,885 --> 00:46:20,668
and watch you destroy
everything you've built here.

977
00:46:20,668 --> 00:46:23,035
- You have no right.

978
00:46:23,035 --> 00:46:26,567
No idea what I'm feeling right now.

979
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:27,736
- I know that you're hurt,

980
00:46:27,736 --> 00:46:29,509
and I know that you're lonely,

981
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:31,160
and I know that some people close to you

982
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,169
have done some pretty horrible things,

983
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:34,969
but we love you.

984
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:36,993
(sighs)

985
00:46:36,993 --> 00:46:39,608
Are you taking your meds?

986
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:42,622
- There will be within
the next generation or so

987
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:43,985
a pharmacological method

988
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:46,830
of making people love their servitude.

989
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,684
- Are you taking your medication?

990
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:51,649
- Like clockwork.

991
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:53,853
It's feeding time now.

992
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,353
(eerie music)

993
00:46:57,627 --> 00:46:59,708
They're getting smaller.

994
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:01,166
- What's getting smaller?

995
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,666
- My blue pills are shrinking.

996
00:47:07,669 --> 00:47:10,291
- Okay, let's just save
that decision-making stuff

997
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,144
for another day.

998
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:12,640
- Yeah? What's to decide?

999
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,936
- I am really, really worried about you.

1000
00:47:14,936 --> 00:47:17,323
- You're worried about your investment.

1001
00:47:17,323 --> 00:47:18,560
- I'm worried about your health,

1002
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,404
I'm worried about the fact
that you're not fitting in,

1003
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,158
I'm worried that people
up here don't like you.

1004
00:47:22,158 --> 00:47:23,369
- Who said that?

1005
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:26,452
- You did a minute ago
with that power walker.

1006
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:27,834
- I don't give a damn what she thinks,

1007
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:28,675
she can go to hell!

1008
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:30,514
- Don't be like that.

1009
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,138
You have such kindness and integrity,

1010
00:47:33,138 --> 00:47:35,326
just hold onto that.

1011
00:47:35,326 --> 00:47:37,321
Adjust behavior and fix your reputation

1012
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,321
while you have a chance.

1013
00:47:42,846 --> 00:47:45,197
I want you to see a doctor.

1014
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:47,829
I want you to consider
resuming treatment in New York.

1015
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:49,141
- I can't, I can't, I can't leave

1016
00:47:49,141 --> 00:47:50,038
and go into treatment,

1017
00:47:50,038 --> 00:47:52,121
I have a business to run.

1018
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:54,872
- Grady Wilson.

1019
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,243
From what I see, you are in no condition

1020
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:57,743
to run a business.

1021
00:48:01,822 --> 00:48:04,655
(rain sprinkling)

1022
00:48:17,504 --> 00:48:20,421
(mysterious music)

1023
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:43,651
(laptop slams)

1024
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:44,568
- Any luck?

1025
00:48:45,597 --> 00:48:47,194
- Its neck is broken.

1026
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:50,396
- At least it wasn't yours--
(creaking)

1027
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:51,896
- [Rye] Hey buddy!

1028
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,679
- I, uh, thinking of a filet

1029
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:56,728
and grilled sole for dinner,

1030
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,630
kind of a surf and turf.

1031
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,810
- Okay.

1032
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,521
- Sounds good.

1033
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,853
I like sole.

1034
00:49:02,853 --> 00:49:04,315
- Great.

1035
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:06,892
I'll run to the store right
after I walk the dogs.

1036
00:49:06,892 --> 00:49:08,809
Anybody want anything?

1037
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:09,809
- No thanks.

1038
00:49:22,356 --> 00:49:24,083
- A little bit of the bipolar.

1039
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:24,916
- Ya think?

1040
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:26,211
- Don't joke.

1041
00:49:26,211 --> 00:49:27,745
- I wish.

1042
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:28,824
He scares me.

1043
00:49:28,824 --> 00:49:31,418
- What was the name of
his doctor in New York?

1044
00:49:31,418 --> 00:49:34,398
- Ben Fiensburg, Ben Fienstein.

1045
00:49:34,398 --> 00:49:35,468
- Which?

1046
00:49:35,468 --> 00:49:38,594
(dark eerie music)

1047
00:49:38,594 --> 00:49:39,622
- Hey Beetle, listen,

1048
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:42,917
I got a little carried
away in my head earlier,

1049
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:43,851
I'm sorry.

1050
00:49:43,851 --> 00:49:46,359
- Can't say that I blame you, not one bit,

1051
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,603
I'm sure Andy deserved
everything you threw at him.

1052
00:49:48,603 --> 00:49:51,618
- You know, I even considered
snatching Andy's cell

1053
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:54,479
and calling the new boyfriend to warn him.

1054
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:56,300
- Not a bad idea if you ask me.

1055
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,167
- No, no, I reconsidered.

1056
00:49:58,167 --> 00:49:59,167
So not cool.

1057
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:03,161
- Grady, I hope you don't blame me.

1058
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:06,640
Last thing I want is to
be in any kind of trouble.

1059
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,289
I could go if you want.

1060
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:09,831
- It's raining cats and dogs out there,

1061
00:50:09,831 --> 00:50:11,410
where are you gonna go?

1062
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:14,060
No, you should stay here.

1063
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,863
- You're a good man, no
matter what they say.

1064
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:18,388
I have respect for you.

1065
00:50:18,388 --> 00:50:19,471
True respect.

1066
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:23,320
Grady?

1067
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:26,700
Who's Manny Knowles?

1068
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:28,971
- Why?

1069
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:32,244
- Isn't he that famous actor?

1070
00:50:32,244 --> 00:50:33,933
- Did someone mention him to you?

1071
00:50:33,933 --> 00:50:35,388
- Well, not to me specific,

1072
00:50:35,388 --> 00:50:37,638
but I overhead some things.

1073
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:43,486
- Tell me what they
said, exactly every word.

1074
00:50:43,486 --> 00:50:45,736
- Well, Andy said to Karen,

1075
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:48,966
"If it weren't for your deceit,

1076
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:51,001
"none of Grady's mess
ever would've gone down,"

1077
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:54,923
and Karen said something like, "low blow,"

1078
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:58,642
and they started calling
one another names.

1079
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:02,152
And Andy just shouted Manny Knowles.

1080
00:51:02,152 --> 00:51:05,235
(dark mystery music)

1081
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:25,820
- There are 17 different
Fiensteins in New York.

1082
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,403
(echoed voices chattering)

1083
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:41,443
- [Andy] Can't stop.

1084
00:51:41,443 --> 00:51:44,821
(echoed voices laughing)

1085
00:51:44,821 --> 00:51:46,295
- People up here don't like you.

1086
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:49,047
(chattering, laughing continues)

1087
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:50,712
Who's that?

1088
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:52,771
(door thuds)

1089
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:54,938
- [Rye] Was that the door?

1090
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,323
- No, I'm not a relative,

1091
00:52:04,323 --> 00:52:07,135
but I am a close friend.

1092
00:52:07,135 --> 00:52:10,021
No, this is urgent, Grady
is becoming violent.

1093
00:52:10,021 --> 00:52:11,011
No, I'm in North Carolina with him,

1094
00:52:11,011 --> 00:52:14,580
he doesn't know that I'm making this call.

1095
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:18,750
Well, Grady thinks that
we're trying to kill him.

1096
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:22,917
Yes, he's had flu-like symptoms,
mood swings, hostility.

1097
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:26,429
He's had tremors and--

1098
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:28,391
- Tell him.

1099
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:32,579
- Oh, he said that he had
a really terrible headache.

1100
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:36,551
I'm sorry, Antidepressant
Discontinuation Syndrome?

1101
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:39,555
No, but I've seen him take his pills.

1102
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:40,684
Oh, you don't have to do that.

1103
00:52:40,684 --> 00:52:42,459
- [Beetle] Oh, I'll be out
of your way in a jiffy.

1104
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,292
- You're not in my way,

1105
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:45,343
I just have to grab a
sweater or something.

1106
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:46,758
- [Beetle] Is Grady gonna be okay?

1107
00:52:46,758 --> 00:52:48,352
- Um, yeah, I hope so.

1108
00:52:48,352 --> 00:52:49,760
We think maybe seeing
his doctor in New York

1109
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,761
for a few days might help.

1110
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:53,110
Might you consider staying on here

1111
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,988
and looking after things for a while?

1112
00:52:54,988 --> 00:52:55,821
- I'm here to help out

1113
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:57,790
in any way you see fit.

1114
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,748
Doctor visit or not,

1115
00:52:58,748 --> 00:53:00,874
a trip to New York
sounds exciting for him.

1116
00:53:00,874 --> 00:53:01,926
- Hey, you know, later,

1117
00:53:01,926 --> 00:53:03,539
if you ever think about
coming to New York,

1118
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:05,550
I'll do what I could to
help you get started.

1119
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,123
- You'd let me?

1120
00:53:07,123 --> 00:53:08,560
- Um...

1121
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,682
Yeah!

1122
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:10,849
Yeah, I would.

1123
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:14,351
- I'm deeply moved, Karen.

1124
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:17,538
Nobody's ever offered to
help me like this before.

1125
00:53:17,538 --> 00:53:18,955
- You're welcome.

1126
00:53:22,722 --> 00:53:25,305
(upbeat music)

1127
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:28,803
- Excuse me.

1128
00:53:31,513 --> 00:53:34,434
Grady Wilson, from up at the lodge?

1129
00:53:34,434 --> 00:53:35,705
- Yeah.

1130
00:53:35,705 --> 00:53:39,379
- I hadn't received my pay from you.

1131
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:40,862
- Excuse me?

1132
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:42,695
- I snaked your pipes.

1133
00:53:44,036 --> 00:53:46,185
- Oh, you must be Arlis.

1134
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:48,912
Hi, it's a pleasure to
meet you face to face.

1135
00:53:48,912 --> 00:53:50,758
Thank you for your excellent work.

1136
00:53:50,758 --> 00:53:52,189
- If you're satisfied with my work,

1137
00:53:52,189 --> 00:53:53,910
why haven't you paid me?

1138
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:57,238
- Well, send me a bill and I will.

1139
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:58,544
- You have my bill.

1140
00:53:58,544 --> 00:54:00,520
For a $160, you do.

1141
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,998
- There must be some misunderstanding,

1142
00:54:01,998 --> 00:54:03,033
I haven't seen--

1143
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,934
- Suppose you pay me now.

1144
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:07,211
- I don't have any cash
on me right now, Arlis.

1145
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:08,548
- Figured that.

1146
00:54:08,548 --> 00:54:10,166
Disrespect.

1147
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,192
And the way you treat that poor kid,

1148
00:54:12,192 --> 00:54:15,894
especially with what happened
to his mother and all,

1149
00:54:15,894 --> 00:54:17,238
I pity you, sir.

1150
00:54:17,238 --> 00:54:18,430
I shall pray for you.

1151
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,502
- What are you talking about?

1152
00:54:19,502 --> 00:54:21,454
- Good day, sir.

1153
00:54:21,454 --> 00:54:23,825
Enjoy your fancy steaks.

1154
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:26,492
(phone ringing)

1155
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:30,122
- Hello.

1156
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:31,139
- [Man] Grady.

1157
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,741
- Hi, Dr. Fienstein.

1158
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:33,783
- [Dr. Fienstein] I have
heard from your friend

1159
00:54:33,783 --> 00:54:35,539
Karen Killington.

1160
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,648
I'm concerned with your
medication's effectiveness,

1161
00:54:37,648 --> 00:54:40,637
I have called in a new
prescription for you.

1162
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:43,061
- I don't want a different prescription.

1163
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:43,894
- [Dr. Fienstein] You don't have to take

1164
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:45,559
anything you don't want, but they say

1165
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:47,562
you're acting very strange.

1166
00:54:47,562 --> 00:54:50,479
- You know, it's not me, it's them.

1167
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:52,829
My boyfriend dumped me.

1168
00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:54,297
He tried to hit on this
poor kid at the lodge

1169
00:54:54,297 --> 00:54:55,698
who's working for me,

1170
00:54:55,698 --> 00:54:56,842
I just found out that my best friend

1171
00:54:56,842 --> 00:54:59,383
is responsible for
killing my acting career,

1172
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,131
and my new business is practically broke.

1173
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:01,964
- [Dr. Fienstein] All the more reason

1174
00:55:01,964 --> 00:55:03,982
to adjust your medication now, Grady.

1175
00:55:03,982 --> 00:55:07,732
- (sighs) No, I won't do it.

1176
00:55:11,193 --> 00:55:13,360
- I understand. Thank you.

1177
00:55:15,785 --> 00:55:18,865
Dr. Fienstein says that he believes

1178
00:55:18,865 --> 00:55:21,806
Grady's mood swings could be justified.

1179
00:55:21,806 --> 00:55:25,309
Did you tell Grady about Manny Knowles?

1180
00:55:25,309 --> 00:55:26,933
- No.

1181
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:27,907
- Well, he knew.

1182
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,990
Or Grady told his doctor.

1183
00:55:30,981 --> 00:55:32,429
He said he called in
a prescription anyway,

1184
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,866
but he doesn't think that
Grady's gonna pick it up.

1185
00:55:33,866 --> 00:55:36,860
(phone ringing)

1186
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,115
Barry, I am sorry,

1187
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:39,283
I'm not gonna be able to talk right now,

1188
00:55:39,283 --> 00:55:40,532
I'll have to catch up with you on Mon,

1189
00:55:40,532 --> 00:55:41,449
no, Monday.

1190
00:55:43,649 --> 00:55:44,482
Thanks.

1191
00:55:53,264 --> 00:55:55,931
- Let's go get his prescription.

1192
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,137
(intense rhythmic music)

1193
00:56:31,493 --> 00:56:33,826
(loud thud)

1194
00:56:41,238 --> 00:56:43,571
(whooshing)

1195
00:56:46,264 --> 00:56:48,394
- Grady, come on down for a second.

1196
00:56:48,394 --> 00:56:52,967
Honey, I'm sorry (mumbling), is that okay?

1197
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:54,918
Hey, no matter how mad you are at me

1198
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:55,789
or what you think of me,

1199
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:58,547
I do have your best interest at heart.

1200
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:00,746
- You'd sell me out or
anyone else for that matter

1201
00:57:00,746 --> 00:57:03,493
without a second thought
if it suited your needs.

1202
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:04,767
- What are you talking about?

1203
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,932
- Manny Knowles, Karen.

1204
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:08,114
Your new star client,

1205
00:57:08,114 --> 00:57:09,551
the one who just happened
to step in and replace me

1206
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,932
after my first day on End of the World.

1207
00:57:12,932 --> 00:57:15,042
Manny pretended to be my friend.

1208
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:16,527
I introduced him to you.

1209
00:57:16,527 --> 00:57:17,421
One day he's a bartender,

1210
00:57:17,421 --> 00:57:19,157
the next day he's got my role

1211
00:57:19,157 --> 00:57:21,562
on a major motion picture.

1212
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:23,086
- It was political, Grady.

1213
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:24,436
The director met him and liked him

1214
00:57:24,436 --> 00:57:28,708
and our offices knew that he
was safe to go mainstream.

1215
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:31,326
- This is about my sexuality?

1216
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:33,207
Nobody knew that I was gay.

1217
00:57:33,207 --> 00:57:34,707
- Nobody knew yet.

1218
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:37,932
- So you decided to bury me

1219
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:40,241
before somebody else did.

1220
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:41,623
- I made a decision to invest

1221
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:43,097
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

1222
00:57:43,097 --> 00:57:44,707
into the career of a safe bet.

1223
00:57:44,707 --> 00:57:47,612
Your behavior after is what buried you.

1224
00:57:47,612 --> 00:57:49,318
If I had to do it all over again, I would,

1225
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:51,568
I know that now, forgive me

1226
00:57:52,547 --> 00:57:54,547
for your sake, not mine.

1227
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,213
- You know, I was gonna ask you for a loan

1228
00:57:58,213 --> 00:58:00,702
to keep this place going until spring.

1229
00:58:00,702 --> 00:58:02,084
- Whatever you want, it's yours.

1230
00:58:02,084 --> 00:58:04,069
- No, no, no, no.

1231
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:05,736
No more guilt money.

1232
00:58:07,714 --> 00:58:11,047
God, no wonder you can't sleep at night.

1233
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,967
Don't call my doctor,

1234
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:15,692
don't talk to my friends behind my back,

1235
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:19,859
and please don't pretend
to do me any more favors.

1236
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:24,830
- Here you go.

1237
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:27,413
Do whatever you want with them.

1238
00:58:32,948 --> 00:58:35,865
(mysterious music)

1239
00:58:39,564 --> 00:58:40,725
- So they say they got room on a flight

1240
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,658
tomorrow out of Atlanta.

1241
00:58:42,658 --> 00:58:45,075
You wanted four seats, right?

1242
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,420
- Yeah.

1243
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,337
Four seats.

1244
00:58:49,453 --> 00:58:51,036
Use my credit card.

1245
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:04,008
About last night,

1246
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:09,382
sorry if my behavior was inappropriate.

1247
00:59:09,382 --> 00:59:10,998
It's an unfortunate misunderstanding,

1248
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:13,152
and I hope there are no hard feelings.

1249
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:14,652
- None whatsoever.

1250
00:59:17,344 --> 00:59:18,475
If I were you, I'd give a heads up

1251
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:22,172
to that friend of yours in New York.

1252
00:59:22,172 --> 00:59:23,565
- What do you mean?

1253
00:59:23,565 --> 00:59:24,398
- Grady said he had a mind

1254
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,848
to steal your cell and call him.

1255
00:59:26,848 --> 00:59:28,812
Crazy way he's been,

1256
00:59:28,812 --> 00:59:33,017
there's not telling
the damage he'll do ya.

1257
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:35,152
- Thanks for that information.

1258
00:59:35,152 --> 00:59:36,985
I want that card back.

1259
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:40,828
(dark eerie music)

1260
01:00:11,269 --> 01:00:14,026
- What are you up to, Beetle?

1261
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:17,026

Beetle, I need your help tonight!

1276
01:01:06,148 --> 01:01:09,065
(mysterious music)

1277
01:01:11,938 --> 01:01:12,808
- You know, you don't look so good,

1278
01:01:12,808 --> 01:01:14,882
I could take of that for you if you like.

1279
01:01:14,882 --> 01:01:15,799
- I'm fine.

1280
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,330
Karen talk to you yet?

1281
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:20,378
- About what?

1282
01:01:20,378 --> 01:01:23,783
- About you staying on
here while I'm away.

1283
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:25,826
- She might've mentioned something.

1284
01:01:25,826 --> 01:01:28,803
Whatever I can do to
help out is fine by me.

1285
01:01:28,803 --> 01:01:30,647
- Bet you'd like New York.

1286
01:01:30,647 --> 01:01:32,314
How old are you? 21?

1287
01:01:34,197 --> 01:01:37,059
Same age as me when I first moved there.

1288
01:01:37,059 --> 01:01:39,136
Took me years to find an agent.

1289
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:41,502
Karen took me on back
when she was an assistant.

1290
01:01:41,502 --> 01:01:43,356
She's gonna rep you, too, right?

1291
01:01:43,356 --> 01:01:45,052
You did ask.

1292
01:01:45,052 --> 01:01:46,264
- Maybe.

1293
01:01:46,264 --> 01:01:47,794
I suppose so.

1294
01:01:47,794 --> 01:01:49,818
- To be 21 again.

1295
01:01:49,818 --> 01:01:51,684
Starting over in New York City.

1296
01:01:51,684 --> 01:01:54,267
God, things I'd do differently.

1297
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,528
- I can only imagine.

1298
01:01:58,569 --> 01:02:02,736
- You know, our imaginations
can take us anywhere.

1299
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:05,288
Somehow dragging our physical bodies

1300
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,705
along with us in the process.

1301
01:02:09,122 --> 01:02:13,980
Hey, hey, you can chop
those up a lot finer, here.

1302
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,530
Now roll your knife.

1303
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:18,280
(knife swishing)

1304
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:22,899
You know, Beetle,

1305
01:02:22,899 --> 01:02:25,435
I've been thinking a lot about
your family this afternoon.

1306
01:02:25,435 --> 01:02:26,458
- My family?

1307
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:28,344
- Your mother in particular.

1308
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,095
Oh! What time is it?

1309
01:02:30,095 --> 01:02:31,356
Shit, I gotta run out for a few minutes.

1310
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:33,273
- What about my mother?

1311
01:02:34,124 --> 01:02:34,957
- I wanna found out a little bit more

1312
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:36,007
about her, that's all.

1313
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:37,120
- Now?

1314
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,671
- That'd be rather hard
to do now, wouldn't it?

1315
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,527
Yeah, well hey, I just need
to run out for an errand.

1316
01:02:41,527 --> 01:02:44,155
Oh, God, what happened to that invoice

1317
01:02:44,155 --> 01:02:45,857
from your good bud Arlis?

1318
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:46,897
- What invoice?

1319
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:47,980
- You know Arlis the plumber?

1320
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,107
Where's the invoice?

1321
01:02:49,107 --> 01:02:50,876
I want to drop off his pay today.

1322
01:02:50,876 --> 01:02:51,709
- In this weather?

1323
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:52,998
No, wait 'til Monday.

1324
01:02:52,998 --> 01:02:54,559
- When do you expect me to pay him?

1325
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,967
Before Monday I'd imagine.

1326
01:02:56,967 --> 01:02:58,922
- I don't know, perhaps.

1327
01:02:58,922 --> 01:02:59,911
- So it wouldn't be ethical for me

1328
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:03,416
to keep him waiting on
account of a little rain.

1329
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:04,284
- I guess not.

1330
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:05,933
I think it's at the desk.

1331
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:07,350
- Let's go check.

1332
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,465
- It must be here some place.

1333
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:15,651
Maybe the wind blew it.

1334
01:03:15,651 --> 01:03:16,797
- Maybe.

1335
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:18,314
It'll turn up sooner or later.

1336
01:03:18,314 --> 01:03:19,647
How much was it?

1337
01:03:20,512 --> 01:03:23,429
(dark eerie music)

1338
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:26,236
Which way?

1339
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:30,403
- [Beetle] Take the next
left and go on up to the top.

1340
01:03:32,584 --> 01:03:35,655
- You know, one thing
that I've learned that

1341
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:38,140
you might not have picked
up on yet at your age

1342
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,340
is never to underestimate anybody.

1343
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,709
That's the most brilliant thing about

1344
01:03:42,709 --> 01:03:45,053
the human condition and human behavior.

1345
01:03:45,053 --> 01:03:47,085
Try as you may, you
can never truly predict

1346
01:03:47,085 --> 01:03:51,376
the reactions of another
mortal. (chuckling)

1347
01:03:51,376 --> 01:03:53,752
That's exactly what I'm
doing right now, isn't it?

1348
01:03:53,752 --> 01:03:57,340
Assuming that you can predict my behavior.

1349
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,258
Well, did you, Beetle?

1350
01:03:59,258 --> 01:04:01,508
Did you guess my next move?

1351
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,529
Did you know I spent my entire career

1352
01:04:05,529 --> 01:04:10,225
working alongside games
and players just like you?

1353
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:13,053
Did you know that I often won?

1354
01:04:13,053 --> 01:04:14,870
'Til that last battle.

1355
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:17,337
Manny Knowles, you know about that.

1356
01:04:17,337 --> 01:04:20,100
I guess after so much
betrayal and humiliation,

1357
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,388
I just didn't want to play anymore.

1358
01:04:22,388 --> 01:04:24,221
Lost my hope, I guess,

1359
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:28,232
well, you know what happened after that.

1360
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:30,686
Tried to off myself.

1361
01:04:30,686 --> 01:04:31,769
Tried to die.

1362
01:04:33,676 --> 01:04:35,428
Not today, though.

1363
01:04:35,428 --> 01:04:37,685
I like this game too much.

1364
01:04:37,685 --> 01:04:40,784
Did you predict that, Beetle?

1365
01:04:40,784 --> 01:04:42,500
- I think you're losing
your grip on reality, Grady,

1366
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,060
I really do.

1367
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,498
You're making me very nervous.

1368
01:04:45,498 --> 01:04:46,410
- Why?

1369
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:50,577
You think I'm gonna try
to touch you or something?

1370
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,679
- It's on the left.
- Huh?

1371
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:56,929
- His place is on the left.

1372
01:05:00,218 --> 01:05:02,885
(brakes squeak)

1373
01:05:09,895 --> 01:05:11,450
- Well, come on.

1374
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,867
He's your friend.

1375
01:05:14,537 --> 01:05:16,787
(knocking)

1376
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:19,607
Hey Arlis.

1377
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:20,855
Sorry to just drop in like this,

1378
01:05:20,855 --> 01:05:22,811
but we got some money for you

1379
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:24,978
and some beer if you like.

1380
01:05:26,193 --> 01:05:27,026
- Well don't just stand there

1381
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:28,366
letting the cold in,

1382
01:05:28,366 --> 01:05:29,283
come on in.

1383
01:05:36,708 --> 01:05:38,763
- I sure do apologize for not being there

1384
01:05:38,763 --> 01:05:41,026
when you were working yesterday, Arlis.

1385
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:42,424
- It's alright, I guess.

1386
01:05:42,424 --> 01:05:43,322
- I just wanna say that

1387
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:44,941
when you came--
- But Beetle here

1388
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,576
insisted on coming with me tonight,

1389
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,875
see, he feels real bad, don't you?

1390
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,199
Don't worry, he'll understand.

1391
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:53,215
See, Beetle feels bad on account of

1392
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,842
he lost your invoice.

1393
01:05:54,842 --> 01:05:57,087
Seems the wind blew it off somehow.

1394
01:05:57,087 --> 01:05:58,794
He never gave it to me.

1395
01:05:58,794 --> 01:06:00,074
- Is that right, son?

1396
01:06:00,074 --> 01:06:01,980
- Well, it was there waiting for him,

1397
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,243
I guess the wind took it.

1398
01:06:04,243 --> 01:06:06,019
- Anyway, he wanted to apologize

1399
01:06:06,019 --> 01:06:08,686
for putting you and I
in an awkward position.

1400
01:06:08,686 --> 01:06:10,632
Is there some way I can make it up to you?

1401
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:13,002
- The beer and the check is just fine.

1402
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,311
Accidents do happen, I suppose.

1403
01:06:15,311 --> 01:06:16,610
- Yeah.

1404
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:17,936
We should be going.

1405
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:19,041
Got a bunch of folks back at the lodge

1406
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,541
waiting on supper.

1407
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:25,250
Come on, bud, we got
hungry guests to feed.

1408
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,083
Chop chop!

1409
01:06:29,094 --> 01:06:31,787
I couldn't have done any
of this without Beetle.

1410
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:32,620
To Beetle.

1411
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:36,227
- [Karen] What's this
other plate here for?

1412
01:06:36,227 --> 01:06:39,347
- Oh God, I thought for
sure she'd be here by now.

1413
01:06:39,347 --> 01:06:40,661
- [Andy] She who?

1414
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:41,818
- Beetle's mom.

1415
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:44,568
Can't imagine what's keeping her.

1416
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:46,994
I ran into her in town today.

1417
01:06:46,994 --> 01:06:49,056
Now before you say anything, buddy,

1418
01:06:49,056 --> 01:06:50,439
I want you to know,

1419
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:51,617
we had a nice talk,

1420
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:53,637
I told her all about your successes

1421
01:06:53,637 --> 01:06:54,903
and your new friends,

1422
01:06:54,903 --> 01:06:56,987
and she just wanted to stop in and see you

1423
01:06:56,987 --> 01:06:58,404
before, you know.

1424
01:06:59,858 --> 01:07:00,691
- Before what?

1425
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:02,003
- Before he moves to the big city

1426
01:07:02,003 --> 01:07:04,190
and starts his life as an actor

1427
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,834
thanks to his new agent Karen.

1428
01:07:06,834 --> 01:07:09,974
- Well, I did offer to help
if that's what he wanted.

1429
01:07:09,974 --> 01:07:11,567
- Well, it is.

1430
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:13,316
We talked at length about his future.

1431
01:07:13,316 --> 01:07:14,992
Good call, Karen.

1432
01:07:14,992 --> 01:07:16,423
He's got what it takes.

1433
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:18,374
Maybe even more than I did.

1434
01:07:18,374 --> 01:07:21,483
Boy, your mom couldn't have
been prouder of you today.

1435
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:22,606
She's a nice woman,

1436
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:24,723
I see where you get your charm.

1437
01:07:24,723 --> 01:07:28,723
She just wanted to see
you and know you're okay.

1438
01:07:30,257 --> 01:07:31,924
- I didn't know you even knew her name.

1439
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:32,830
- Sure I do.

1440
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,243
It's Carla May.

1441
01:07:34,243 --> 01:07:35,576
Carla May Hobbs.

1442
01:07:36,463 --> 01:07:39,522
Let's start without Carla May.

1443
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:42,605
(dark mystery music)

1444
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:47,589
I never met a Pentecostal before.

1445
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:50,095
Carla May is Pentecostal.

1446
01:07:50,095 --> 01:07:53,774
You handled live snakes in
your prayer services, right?

1447
01:07:53,774 --> 01:07:54,607
- Snakes?

1448
01:07:55,582 --> 01:07:57,068
- We did a couple of times.

1449
01:07:57,068 --> 01:07:58,890
- [Karen] Did you handle a snake?

1450
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:00,417
- Once.

1451
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:01,843
- [Karen] What happened?

1452
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:03,250
- I didn't get bit.

1453
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:06,881
- Wow, you're one of the Lord's chosen.

1454
01:08:06,881 --> 01:08:09,048
If you handle a snake in
church and it doesn't kill you,

1455
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:11,631
you're one of God's chosen few.

1456
01:08:14,305 --> 01:08:15,805
- Congratulations.

1457
01:08:16,804 --> 01:08:19,887
(dark mystery music)

1458
01:08:32,964 --> 01:08:35,319
(hissing)

1459
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,482
- Clear the left sink,

1460
01:08:36,482 --> 01:08:38,009
scrape, put the dishes in to soak

1461
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:41,198
for a couple of minutes
before you scrub them.

1462
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,948
What, it'll make cleaning easier.

1463
01:08:45,568 --> 01:08:47,128
You're doing well.

1464
01:08:47,128 --> 01:08:48,423
- Not doing much of anything.

1465
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:49,487
- Exactly.

1466
01:08:49,487 --> 01:08:51,284
That's the way I like it.

1467
01:08:51,284 --> 01:08:53,247
Oh, where you going?

1468
01:08:53,247 --> 01:08:54,789
- Collecting the rest of the dirty dishes.

1469
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:57,168
- Nah, you stay put, I'll do it for you.

1470
01:08:57,168 --> 01:09:00,835
Don't forget those pots
and pans over there.

1471
01:09:03,354 --> 01:09:06,187
(dishes clanging)

1472
01:09:08,999 --> 01:09:11,749
(rhythmic music)

1473
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,311
Yes, it's a much nicer room,

1474
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:16,598
only 35 more a night.

1475
01:09:16,598 --> 01:09:17,431
Great.

1476
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:19,739
Alright, bye-bye.

1477
01:09:21,077 --> 01:09:21,910
- Grady.

1478
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,514
Come sit with us for a second.

1479
01:09:23,514 --> 01:09:26,058
- Sorry, work is never done here.

1480
01:09:26,058 --> 01:09:27,394
- We want to talk to you.

1481
01:09:27,394 --> 01:09:28,322
- Sounds like trouble.

1482
01:09:28,322 --> 01:09:29,630
- [Karen] Oh no, not at all.

1483
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:31,534
- Is this act for real?

1484
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:32,367
- Act?

1485
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:37,575
- We have a ticket for
you to come with us.

1486
01:09:37,575 --> 01:09:38,595
I mean just for a couple of days,

1487
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:41,484
you know, see your doctor,
make sure everything's okay.

1488
01:09:41,484 --> 01:09:42,786
- Look, you don't have
to sell me on the trip,

1489
01:09:42,786 --> 01:09:44,489
I'm cooperating.

1490
01:09:44,489 --> 01:09:46,371
Beetle can manage while I'm gone.

1491
01:09:46,371 --> 01:09:49,573
- Or it is a slow season,
you could just close up.

1492
01:09:49,573 --> 01:09:51,867
- Beetle can manage.

1493
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:53,393
After tonight I'll go with you

1494
01:09:53,393 --> 01:09:55,999
wherever you want me to go.

1495
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:57,734
Oh, dishes done, Beetle?

1496
01:09:57,734 --> 01:09:58,567
- [Beetle] Yes, sir.

1497
01:09:58,567 --> 01:10:00,102
- Great, would you care to join us?

1498
01:10:00,102 --> 01:10:00,935
Hey, while you're up,

1499
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,806
could you put another log on the fire?

1500
01:10:02,806 --> 01:10:04,703
Ooh, looks like we're out of wood.

1501
01:10:04,703 --> 01:10:05,716
I'm gonna have to go up to the barn

1502
01:10:05,716 --> 01:10:06,806
and split some more.

1503
01:10:06,806 --> 01:10:07,639
Come on, Beetle.

1504
01:10:07,639 --> 01:10:08,806
- I'll help you.
- No, no, no, no,

1505
01:10:08,806 --> 01:10:11,169
you're a guest, you sit
and you enjoy your beer.

1506
01:10:11,169 --> 01:10:12,002
Come on.

1507
01:10:12,002 --> 01:10:13,082
- Beetle, keep an eye on him,

1508
01:10:13,082 --> 01:10:14,399
something's not right.

1509
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:15,899
- [Grady] Beetle!

1510
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,100
(dark eerie music)

1511
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:29,015
- What are we doing here?

1512
01:10:29,015 --> 01:10:30,662
I thought we were going to
the barn and get fire wood?

1513
01:10:30,662 --> 01:10:33,745
- I want to show you something first.

1514
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:37,918
- Let's talk hypothetically for a second.

1515
01:10:37,918 --> 01:10:39,710
If you were a good-looking poor kid

1516
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:40,991
with a decent head on your shoulders

1517
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:43,245
and absolutely no morals,

1518
01:10:43,245 --> 01:10:45,503
what would you do?

1519
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:49,170
- I'd find a gullible
new guy in town and...

1520
01:10:51,507 --> 01:10:53,757
Try and take over his life.

1521
01:10:58,856 --> 01:11:00,767
- What's all that supposed to prove?

1522
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:02,202
- Don't you know better
than to mess with a guy

1523
01:11:02,202 --> 01:11:03,696
who has nothing to lose?

1524
01:11:03,696 --> 01:11:05,158
- There you go again.

1525
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:07,385
Not appreciating everything
you've been handed.

1526
01:11:07,385 --> 01:11:08,619
- Handed. Handed?

1527
01:11:08,619 --> 01:11:09,696
Is that what you think?

1528
01:11:09,696 --> 01:11:11,673
Everything comes with a price.

1529
01:11:11,673 --> 01:11:13,093
- What would you know about that?

1530
01:11:13,093 --> 01:11:14,821
- I know that you killed your mother.

1531
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:17,067
You made it look like suicide.

1532
01:11:17,067 --> 01:11:18,745
That's what you do, right?

1533
01:11:18,745 --> 01:11:19,603
What did Carla May do?

1534
01:11:19,603 --> 01:11:21,275
Catch you dealing,
threaten to turn you in?

1535
01:11:21,275 --> 01:11:22,915
- She had it coming.

1536
01:11:22,915 --> 01:11:23,856
You'll never prove anything,

1537
01:11:23,856 --> 01:11:27,162
who'd ever believe I'd
do something like that?

1538
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:27,995
- I would.

1539
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:30,242
- [Grady] Threaten to turn you in?

1540
01:11:30,242 --> 01:11:31,739
- [Beetle] She had it coming.

1541
01:11:31,739 --> 01:11:34,009
You'll never prove anything.

1542
01:11:34,009 --> 01:11:36,256
- I guess if no one shows us we're wrong,

1543
01:11:36,256 --> 01:11:37,977
man's destined to repeat his mistakes,

1544
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:40,134
and that's exactly what
you're doing, Beetle.

1545
01:11:40,134 --> 01:11:42,591
Repeating your mistakes.

1546
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,867
Police are onto you.

1547
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:47,260
And all they need's a
little bit of evidence.

1548
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,423
- There is nothing that Beetle has done

1549
01:11:48,423 --> 01:11:50,083
that's questionable.

1550
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,298
It's all in Grady's head.

1551
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:53,315
Tell me something that
Beetle has done wrong,

1552
01:11:53,315 --> 01:11:55,315
and I'll consider your theory.

1553
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:57,565
- It's just that, a theory.

1554
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:01,492
- If I die, at least I will
leave something behind,

1555
01:12:01,492 --> 01:12:03,669
it might even be in national reports.

1556
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:05,544
What ever happened to Grady Wilson?

1557
01:12:05,544 --> 01:12:06,618
Tragic.

1558
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:09,724
A victim of society
before the gay movement.

1559
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:11,759
They might even consider me a hero.

1560
01:12:11,759 --> 01:12:12,777
- Hero?

1561
01:12:12,777 --> 01:12:13,887
Nah.

1562
01:12:13,887 --> 01:12:15,373
Tragic, yes, sir.

1563
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,750
Homosexuals deny the Lord's path,

1564
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,933
and His judgement--
- Your truth.

1565
01:12:18,933 --> 01:12:20,150
- Is a far a greater punishment

1566
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,181
than I could ever give.
- Do you honestly believe that

1567
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:23,416
God wants you to hate another man,

1568
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:24,990
kill another man?

1569
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,694
- You don't know my Lord.

1570
01:12:26,694 --> 01:12:28,339
- You don't either, Beetle.

1571
01:12:28,339 --> 01:12:30,450
You've committed every
sin in the name of God.

1572
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,281
- God helps them that helps themselves.

1573
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,441
And the proof is I've already won.

1574
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:35,891
They're sending you to the hospital

1575
01:12:35,891 --> 01:12:37,283
and asked me to run the hotel.

1576
01:12:37,283 --> 01:12:38,533
- It's a lodge!

1577
01:12:41,422 --> 01:12:43,641
And you can't silence me forever.

1578
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:45,036
- [Beetle] Can't I?

1579
01:12:45,036 --> 01:12:47,119
Compliments of Ms. Karen.

1580
01:12:48,847 --> 01:12:50,290
- I've set you up, Beetle.

1581
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,626
I already talked to the police.

1582
01:12:51,626 --> 01:12:54,118
They're gonna be here any minute.

1583
01:12:54,118 --> 01:12:55,747
- I guess I better hurry then.

1584
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,159
How many you think it'll take?

1585
01:12:57,159 --> 01:12:58,326
I got 30 here.

1586
01:13:00,862 --> 01:13:03,132
(sputters)

1587
01:13:03,132 --> 01:13:05,161
- That'll be 29 now.

1588
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,096
- This will never work, Beetle.

1589
01:13:07,096 --> 01:13:08,511
- Of course it will!

1590
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:10,391
Just come back with some fire wood,

1591
01:13:10,391 --> 01:13:11,943
tell them you were tired and went to bed,

1592
01:13:11,943 --> 01:13:14,469
and in the morning, you're dead.

1593
01:13:14,469 --> 01:13:17,365
Poor Grady, he was so weak.

1594
01:13:17,365 --> 01:13:20,282
(intercom ringing)

1595
01:13:22,233 --> 01:13:23,106
- [Woman] There's a huge tree down

1596
01:13:23,106 --> 01:13:25,109
at the bottom of the
hill on the main road,

1597
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,616
there's no going in or out

1598
01:13:26,616 --> 01:13:28,245
unless you take the Tail of the Dragon

1599
01:13:28,245 --> 01:13:29,551
back into Knoxville.

1600
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:31,744
- [Woman] Is that where
you came from, Knoxville?

1601
01:13:31,744 --> 01:13:33,998
(woman mumbles)
(radio beeps)

1602
01:13:33,998 --> 01:13:36,998
(suspenseful music)

1603
01:13:44,984 --> 01:13:47,317
(gun thuds)

1604
01:13:51,443 --> 01:13:52,443
- Well, a little bit of a blackout

1605
01:13:52,443 --> 01:13:54,217
never scared me, man.

1606
01:13:54,217 --> 01:13:55,443
- Here you go.

1607
01:13:55,443 --> 01:13:57,799
- Oh, thank you, that is so nice of you.

1608
01:13:57,799 --> 01:14:00,465
No really, don't you all go making a fuss.

1609
01:14:00,465 --> 01:14:03,882
(dark suspenseful music)

1610
01:14:07,203 --> 01:14:09,453
(grunting)

1611
01:14:20,684 --> 01:14:22,452
Where is Grady anyway?

1612
01:14:22,452 --> 01:14:25,599
- [Rye] He's out back chopping
fire wood with Beetle.

1613
01:14:25,599 --> 01:14:27,855
- I would not turn my back on that one.

1614
01:14:27,855 --> 01:14:29,022
Vile creature.

1615
01:14:34,544 --> 01:14:37,461
(thunder rumbling)

1616
01:14:47,259 --> 01:14:48,259
- Who is it?

1617
01:14:51,357 --> 01:14:52,607
- That's Grady.

1618
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:57,578
(rain pattering)

1619
01:15:01,286 --> 01:15:03,953
(intense music)

1620
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:09,710
Move him to 11 and set him on a bed.

1621
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:13,287
(woman chatters)

1622
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:14,213
- Do you have a pulse?

1623
01:15:14,213 --> 01:15:15,206
- [Andy] It's weak.

1624
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:16,823
- Grady, Grady, talk to me.

1625
01:15:16,823 --> 01:15:17,812
- I'm gonna call for help.

1626
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:19,384
- Grady, Grady, come on, bud.

1627
01:15:19,384 --> 01:15:20,887
Grady, no.

1628
01:15:20,887 --> 01:15:21,720
Grady.

1629
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,553
- [Karen] Grady.

1630
01:15:22,553 --> 01:15:24,321
- He forced some pills.

1631
01:15:24,321 --> 01:15:25,761
- [Rye] You can still roll over.

1632
01:15:25,761 --> 01:15:26,594
- [Woman] What can I do?

1633
01:15:26,594 --> 01:15:27,844
- Go help Andy.

1634
01:15:34,786 --> 01:15:37,256
(Grady gagging)

1635
01:15:37,256 --> 01:15:39,506
- [Grady] He's got my gun.

1636
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:43,361
(gasps)

1637
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:46,001
- [Beetle] Did I scare you, Ms. Roslyn?

1638
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:47,837
- You hurt Grady, didn't you?

1639
01:15:47,837 --> 01:15:49,515
- I didn't hurt anybody.

1640
01:15:49,515 --> 01:15:51,488
I've been chopping wood.

1641
01:15:51,488 --> 01:15:52,850
What's wrong?

1642
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:57,017
- I'm tired of loving youth
and kings of deception.

1643
01:15:59,517 --> 01:16:01,684
- What are we gonna do?

1644
01:16:01,684 --> 01:16:03,993
- Um, it'll be okay.

1645
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:06,243
Everything's gonna be okay.

1646
01:16:08,806 --> 01:16:09,639
- Damn it.

1647
01:16:16,384 --> 01:16:18,049
Got no phone reception!

1648
01:16:18,049 --> 01:16:20,049
Roslyn, can I try yours?

1649
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,166
Hello.

1650
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:23,044
- [Beetle] Andy.

1651
01:16:23,044 --> 01:16:25,405
What the heck's going on?

1652
01:16:25,405 --> 01:16:26,561
- I was hoping you could tell me.

1653
01:16:26,561 --> 01:16:28,978
- [Karen] Andy, come quickly!

1654
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:36,667
- [Rye] He's gone.

1655
01:16:38,316 --> 01:16:39,149
- Grady.

1656
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,293
Grady.

1657
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:45,518
- Our Father which art in heaven,

1658
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,306
hollowed be thy name,

1659
01:16:47,306 --> 01:16:49,967
thy kingdom come, thy will be done

1660
01:16:49,967 --> 01:16:52,699
on earth as it is in heaven,

1661
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:54,294
give us this day our daily bread

1662
01:16:54,294 --> 01:16:56,088
and forgive us our trespasses

1663
01:16:56,088 --> 01:16:59,624
as we forgive those
that trespass against us

1664
01:16:59,624 --> 01:17:01,364
and lead us not into temptation,

1665
01:17:01,364 --> 01:17:03,936
but deliver us from evil--
- They're getting smaller.

1666
01:17:03,936 --> 01:17:05,800
- What's getting smaller?
- For thine is the kingdom.

1667
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,163
- [Grady] The blue pills are shrinking.

1668
01:17:07,163 --> 01:17:10,080
- The glory forever and ever, amen.

1669
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:16,083
(dark suspenseful music)

1670
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:22,020
- You did this, you son of a bitch!

1671
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,424
- Stop, stop! No!

1672
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:24,918
Don't be ridiculous!

1673
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:27,086
We tried to do everything that we could!

1674
01:17:27,086 --> 01:17:28,519
I don't know exactly how this happened,

1675
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,937
but we tried to get the pills out of him,

1676
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,854
and it was an overdose.

1677
01:17:35,941 --> 01:17:37,625
It was another overdose.

1678
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:40,247
There was just too many.

1679
01:17:40,247 --> 01:17:41,889
- [Rye] If you were a
good-looking poor kid

1680
01:17:41,889 --> 01:17:45,639
with absolutely no
morals, what would you do?

1681
01:17:51,269 --> 01:17:55,813
- Thank you for that
lovely prayer, dear boy.

1682
01:17:55,813 --> 01:17:56,646
- Roslyn.

1683
01:17:58,657 --> 01:17:59,907
Where's Roslyn?

1684
01:18:03,277 --> 01:18:05,510
- [Roslyn] I wouldn't
turn my back on that boy.

1685
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,677
Vile creature.

1686
01:18:07,531 --> 01:18:09,850
- [Grady] Everything will make sense.

1687
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:13,252
Tomorrow morning with you whenever.

1688
01:18:13,252 --> 01:18:14,585
- [Andy] Roslyn!

1689
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:21,082
Her car's still here!

1690
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:25,661
(echoed voice chattering)

1691
01:18:33,016 --> 01:18:37,016
(suspenseful music intensifies)

1692
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,913
- [Karen] Beetle!

1693
01:18:39,913 --> 01:18:40,890
Beetle, wait.

1694
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:42,934
- What, Ms. Karen?

1695
01:18:42,934 --> 01:18:45,767
(body clattering)

1696
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:01,076
- Oh my God.

1697
01:19:25,931 --> 01:19:28,181
(grunting)

1698
01:19:32,154 --> 01:19:34,821
(foot thudding)

1699
01:19:37,748 --> 01:19:40,915
(gentle guitar music)

1700
01:19:53,078 --> 01:19:56,328
- I don't think we have much time left.

1701
01:19:58,358 --> 01:20:01,358
- If you grab it all, I've got this.

1702
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:09,943
- The storm took down the whole tree

1703
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:11,138
at the Monouth Pass.

1704
01:20:11,138 --> 01:20:12,332
No one was getting or out

1705
01:20:12,332 --> 01:20:13,692
'til we got a crane on it.

1706
01:20:13,692 --> 01:20:15,465
- Well, I'm glad you're here now.

1707
01:20:15,465 --> 01:20:17,705
And hopefully the phones
will be back on soon, too.

1708
01:20:17,705 --> 01:20:18,952
- So help me out, Mr. Wilson.

1709
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:20,564
You called the station last night

1710
01:20:20,564 --> 01:20:22,396
saying this kid was up to no good.

1711
01:20:22,396 --> 01:20:23,728
- Yes, I did.

1712
01:20:23,728 --> 01:20:25,089
- [Office] And a few hours later,

1713
01:20:25,089 --> 01:20:26,757
he's dead at the bottom of your stairs.

1714
01:20:26,757 --> 01:20:27,865
- So sad, isn't it?

1715
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,000
I mean, he had such potential.

1716
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,725
- You say the boy stayed
in the room with the flags?

1717
01:20:32,725 --> 01:20:34,895
- Yeah, room five, just for the weekend.

1718
01:20:34,895 --> 01:20:38,199
- Found a mess of drugs and
empty wallet in the vent.

1719
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:40,323
- It appears you were correct, Mr. Wilson.

1720
01:20:40,323 --> 01:20:42,816
We'll run a toxicology on Wallace Hobbs,

1721
01:20:42,816 --> 01:20:46,983
it appears drugs may have
played a role in his accident.

1722
01:20:49,798 --> 01:20:52,548
(engine revving)

1723
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:17,487
- Be happy.

1724
01:21:19,267 --> 01:21:20,100
- You too.

1725
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:25,625
(lighthearted music)

1726
01:21:41,088 --> 01:21:42,141
Excuse me, miss.

1727
01:21:42,141 --> 01:21:45,209
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me!

1728
01:21:45,209 --> 01:21:46,436
You're wearing earphones.

1729
01:21:46,436 --> 01:21:47,567
- Yeah.

1730
01:21:47,567 --> 01:21:49,329
- I'm Grady.

1731
01:21:49,329 --> 01:21:50,479
- [Woman] Marcia.

1732
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:51,753
- I see you walking every day,

1733
01:21:51,753 --> 01:21:53,588
I just wanted to say hi

1734
01:21:53,588 --> 01:21:55,440
and extend an invitation for you to visit

1735
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,097
for coffee or water, you know, hydrate.

1736
01:21:59,097 --> 01:22:00,451
It gets lonely up here,

1737
01:22:00,451 --> 01:22:02,428
and I'd like to get to know my neighbors.

1738
01:22:02,428 --> 01:22:03,303
- That's nice.

1739
01:22:03,303 --> 01:22:04,726
Another day.

1740
01:22:04,726 --> 01:22:06,976
We'll see you later, Grady.

1741
01:22:09,579 --> 01:22:11,912
You have a really nice aura.

1742
01:22:14,271 --> 01:22:16,809
(chuckles)

("On My Feet Again" by Ken Will Morton)

1744
01:22:23,457 --> 01:22:26,513

1745
01:22:26,513 --> 01:22:29,762

I left something on your mattress

1750

1751
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:47,216
