1
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:18,395
So, where is this renowned father?

2
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:24,876
Will father show his face to you, sir?

3
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:30,879
A shallow womanizer fashions
himseIf a dashing wit.

4
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,684
Perhaps he cannot hear
your whimpering, sir.

5
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:47,929
Pathetic palter.

6
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:31,361
Very quick.

7
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,728
Move.

8
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:01,418
Some other dog beat us
to the treasure.

9
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,988
Hear that?

10
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,482
No, pIease.

11
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,311
Mercy.

12
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,485
I will serve you.

13
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:43,551
AbeIar, does it still exist?

14
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:46,359
AbeIar?

15
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:48,056
Ah, yes.

16
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:52,837
RuIed by a queen, EIdoria.

17
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:55,435
She has passed on.

18
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:59,433
Her eIdest. . . eIdest chiId Ma'at
is queen now.

19
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,611
Really?

20
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,248
I won't harm the queen,

21
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:08,442
but I will make you do
with her seed.

22
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:12,682
Not that it matters now.
I. . . I was wondering...

23
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,319
- how. . . how your enemies. . .
- To dust.

24
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,388
That will sting.

25
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,055
And now?

26
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,329
And now,

27
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:31,342
say, ''I won't feeI anything
except a IittIe sting.''

28
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:15,520
Tanis.

29
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:19,316
Tanis.

30
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,625
Are you Iistening to me?

31
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:26,761
- Sister.
- It is upon us, your dream.

32
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:28,597
It's happening.

33
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:33,835
After all of these years, the Sorceress
has somehow returned from the dead.

34
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,041
Levana.

35
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,408
PIease don't go.

36
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:50,846
Go, Lenor.

37
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:54,016
PIease, find safety.

38
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,793
All of you Ieave at once.

39
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,601
I will aIert the GeneraI,
Your Highness.

40
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:17,446
And we must find he
who saved us before.

41
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,110
The Mercenary?

42
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:20,775
Your father.

43
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:24,487
But, our father is dead.

44
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,522
He died saving AbeIar
from the Sorceress.

45
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:29,688
Your father is not mine.

46
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,954
I was sired by the king but...

47
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:34,465
you. . .

48
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,431
...you were by this mercenary.

49
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:41,505
Mother said you were
the king's chiId to protect you.

50
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,209
You must Ieave the past behind.

51
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,143
Our kingdom needs us now.

52
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,512
Kingdom Bush is not my father?

53
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:59,414
No, but he who is Iives.

54
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,725
If we so be separated

55
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,660
mother said this will Iead you to him.

56
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:14,362
With this token, he will know you
and you shall know him.

57
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:20,338
And this will heIp you
to understand the sorcery.

58
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:23,876
My Queen.

59
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,244
They are within the paIace,
Your Majesty.

60
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:33,490
You must come now.

61
00:12:07,158 --> 00:12:08,284
You have to go.

62
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,787
No, come with us.

63
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:14,462
My Queen,

64
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:23,097
you both have a Iong time
to struggIe.

65
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,645
I've trained you well,
Your Highness.

66
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,979
You are ready for what comes.

67
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,370
Stand.

68
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:15,923
We can make sure of your safety
if you follow this hall.

69
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,595
It will Iead you out of the paIace.

70
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:20,455
But what about you?

71
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,464
My duty is to remain here, Kara.

72
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,694
No.

73
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:29,201
If you stay, then so will I.

74
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:33,841
You can do nothing more here,
Dernier.

75
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,639
The RoyaIs will scheme
to save their skins.

76
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,443
We will be Ieft to fend for ourseIves
and not aIways with the truth.

77
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,787
They have no regard for us.

78
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,218
But I am sworn to. . .

79
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,438
You have sworn to Iove me, Dernier

80
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:07,401
or was that just to weaken my will.

81
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,211
I Iove you.

82
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,313
Then save us my Iove.

83
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,872
- I must kill the infected.
- Leave her. She's a friend.

84
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:44,413
It's your wish.

85
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,181
There, it Ieads to a quay
where our boat waits.

86
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,649
- It will take you to Durris.
- Durris?

87
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:25,284
An outIaw city?

88
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,918
If he still Iives the peopIe
there will know his whereabouts.

89
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:45,339
Tanis,

90
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:50,937
l'm find

91
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:58,745
remember what I said.

92
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:02,424
If we so be separated,
you must find him.

93
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,526
We've run out of time.

94
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:06,593
Run, Tanis.

95
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,593
- But sister.
- Hush.

96
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,530
You're not a chiId but
a Princess of AbeIar,

97
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,494
a Ieader with responsibiIities.

98
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,406
Act it.

99
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:18,441
Find your father.
Save our peopIe.

100
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,467
They count on us, Tanis.

101
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:24,306
- I can't do this aIone.
- You must.

102
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,577
Go. Now.

103
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:28,376
I command you.

104
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:34,688
Do not Iook back...

105
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:45,634
...or rest.

106
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:16,195
It's been what, 20 years?

107
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:18,901
Where's your mother's Iover?

108
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:21,302
What was his name again?

109
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,841
It seems to have sIipped my mind.

110
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,335
He has not sIipped mine.

111
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:30,336
Why, of course.
He sent your father to the Abyss.

112
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,084
I must have thought
of a million different ways

113
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,283
to make you and your mother suffer,

114
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:41,515
but nothing was ever terribIe enough.

115
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,759
I mean, how do you repay someone

116
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:49,927
who buried you aIive for 20 years?

117
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:04,339
Nothing smelled Iike Iife,
Your Highness.

118
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,979
You must be wondering
how is it she is back

119
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:15,415
Iooking so wonderfully restored.

120
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,090
CIearIy, we watched your destruction.

121
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,728
CIearIy, you shouIdn't have
given the finaI rights

122
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:25,764
to a high priest with designs
on your throat.

123
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:30,371
A pity he perished with some
mysterious pIague upon his return.

124
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:34,335
Who knows what Iives in dust?

125
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,161
And who are you?

126
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:02,498
Go,

127
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,606
go.

128
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,366
- Where is my seat, Your Highness?
- I'm not sure.

129
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,045
Kill her.

130
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:55,423
Get the girI.

131
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:40,262
The paIace is Iost.

132
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:45,492
- The Queen is dead?
- Or worse.

133
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:48,495
What are they?

134
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:54,142
Vampires.

135
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:57,213
But we will not die tonight.

136
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,076
I couId fight harder.

137
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:02,777
You Ieave the killing to me.

138
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,758
What is to become of us now

139
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,360
or the kingdom?

140
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,769
My master is the son of a race.

141
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,601
But, there is aIways a need
for a pretty servant,

142
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,067
and there is one against me as well.

143
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:29,897
- What is it?
- Hush, hush.

144
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,203
Why the guards they are so daunting?

145
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:02,705
They're trying to kill us.

146
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,529
What?

147
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:36,638
It is read.

148
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,567
- It's my fauIt.
- No.

149
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,435
On your Iife run.

150
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:59,719
I have aIways Ioved you.

151
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:15,336
I will.

152
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:56,447
And now, a Iadder across the Abyss
that I might free my father.

153
00:25:56,987 --> 00:25:59,319
In my stead,
you will awaken my seed.

154
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:03,386
She is the true daughter of my race,
and though haIf human,

155
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,361
she will be human no more.

156
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:11,925
Ah, Denier.

157
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:16,371
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

158
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:18,669
You used me.

159
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:22,077
What?

160
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,545
No, I Ioved you.

161
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,110
Really?

162
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,417
Yes, right,

163
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,494
I was using you, Dernier.

164
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:43,729
You are eviI.

165
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:49,170
Becoming a vampire isn't even
the worst of me.

166
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:51,569
That and more.

167
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:56,672
Are you going to kill me now?

168
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:01,448
Bite my throat,
drain me of my bIood?

169
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:05,450
I want you.

170
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,093
I couId soothe you, Dernier.

171
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,588
You couId use someone Iike me

172
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,423
for a sIave.

173
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:24,003
I have too much over the past.

174
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,607
I will bring victims to you

175
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,317
to fuIfill whatever dark
fantasies you have.

176
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:41,287
I will do whatever
I have to do for you?

177
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:47,956
You are a monster.

178
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,670
I will bow to you, Kara.

179
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:08,846
Kara, bow to her.

180
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:18,316
Life takes many forms
in many worIds

181
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,328
and she's in her finaI metamorphosis,

182
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:27,398
her chrysaIis.

183
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:30,771
Why me?

184
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,342
You are speciaI.

185
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,469
But you've aIways known that.

186
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:42,308
SpeciaI in a way that no one eIse
couId see untiI it was too Iate.

187
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:50,325
And even as a chiId,
you have aIways been cunning,

188
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:52,551
intelligent,

189
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,590
depraved.

190
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,534
You have tried to bIend in

191
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:01,236
or be a human,

192
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:03,440
safe,

193
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,242
but even as a chiId you knew
you were different,

194
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:12,311
filled with dark corruptness.

195
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:16,582
Are you ready to be free?

196
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:05,729
You're free now

197
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,998
but not yet fully transformed.

198
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:15,475
I have pity for those who can waIk in the
curse of Iight and among these creatures.

199
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:20,249
We have much more work to do
before we can be safe.

200
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:26,318
I sent the princess to the reefs.

201
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:29,117
If she's dust,

202
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:30,919
find her.

203
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:33,455
Know what she's pIotting,

204
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:37,657
and most importantIy with whom.

205
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,404
Why me?

206
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,538
Because she will know and trust you
when she's most vuInerabIe.

207
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,414
And if I refuse?

208
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:56,784
You've hungered for this day
when you couId be who you are

209
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:58,847
and what you are

210
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:03,117
to Iet those dark urges free.

211
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:29,607
Mother said this will Iead you to him.

212
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:33,977
With this token

213
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:37,453
he will know you
and you shall know him,

214
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:43,354
and this will heIp you
to understand the sorcery.

215
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,002
You're not a chiId
but a Princess of AbeIar,

216
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:58,100
a Ieader with responsibiIities.

217
00:32:58,542 --> 00:32:59,531
Act it.

218
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:03,145
Find your father.
Save our peopIe.

219
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:21,955
My princess.

220
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:35,594
You shouIdn't have been wearing this?

221
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:43,001
PIease.

222
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,576
- You cheated Dog.
- What?

223
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,043
Go weep to the gods.

224
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,371
You will die.

225
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:22,478
I shall cIeave your thick ugIy faces.

226
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:42,360
No dog cheats me and Iives.

227
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,000
Thankfully, I'm not a dog
but I do Iike to cheat.

228
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:52,836
Now, I'm gonna have to kill you
Iike a bitch pup.

229
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:05,118
HoIy shit.

230
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:28,068
I want this man.

231
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:31,473
She wants me.

232
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,680
I'll tell you what, wench,

233
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:44,116
Iet me kill this dog

234
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:47,387
and then I will bed you so hard. . .

235
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:01,342
Somebody you want me.

236
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:42,983
Wench, you've diminished
my reputation.

237
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,049
It couId be diminished, sir?

238
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:46,614
Why bog me,

239
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:50,350
did I do your mother, huh,

240
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,392
or, uh, sister perhaps?

241
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:21,418
The Iast of it,

242
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:26,092
the Iate great AbeIar
and how it came to be overcome.

243
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:28,456
- Sir.
- I mean no disrespect, Iady.

244
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:30,127
I noticed your cIoak.

245
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,067
It came from the paIace guard.

246
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:33,594
So, it is.

247
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:37,438
Like yourseIf, I bareIy escaped
these fouI creatures.

248
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:42,476
I'm here to spread the word
of what these eyes have seen.

249
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:46,040
- You've seen much.
- Aye.

250
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:49,779
In this one worId.
That's why you're here.

251
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,220
You've seen far too much sir.

252
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:03,389
Brother and sister?

253
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:05,525
Different mothers
but a common father.

254
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:08,437
And you say we were meant
to find our father?

255
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,971
ExactIy. And together
we're to destroy the Sorceress Xia

256
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:13,833
and return AbeIar to the peopIe.

257
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:15,067
Uh-huh.

258
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:18,845
So, Princess, you speak
for the RoyaI House?

259
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:20,309
That is correct.

260
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:24,584
How much am I to be paid
to save your precious AbeIar?

261
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:26,619
Paid?

262
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:30,622
I didn't mention anything
about a bounty.

263
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,417
We do this because it's right

264
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:35,129
- and just and it's what we shouId. . .
- This sword will not be drawn

265
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:37,662
untiI it received proper compensation.

266
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,397
You disappoint again.

267
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,531
Oh, my Iady,
one night in bed with me and. . .

268
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:49,672
I'm your sister.

269
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,410
HaIf.

270
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:54,383
How couId I expect any nobiIity
from a pig Iike you.

271
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:55,580
Wait.

272
00:40:58,021 --> 00:40:58,885
Look,

273
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:01,287
your taiI hoIds a certain fancy,

274
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:05,827
but I am in need of coin and I'm willing
to take your word that there will be a bounty.

275
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:08,262
What do you know about him?

276
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:11,990
Well, not much.

277
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:14,293
Nothing at all.

278
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:16,397
Nor a trickster?

279
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:19,565
Aye, but this trickster knows
where our sister may be,

280
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,273
and to her our dear father.

281
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,442
A sister?

282
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,210
Where?

283
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:30,579
About that bounty?

284
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:34,489
If your word proves true,

285
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,350
then you shall have it.

286
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,127
I gave you my word.

287
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:42,761
That shouId be sufficient.

288
00:41:45,802 --> 00:41:47,030
I am called Aedan.

289
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,765
And what are you doing here?

290
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,369
What?
Can't a brother heIp his sister?

291
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:24,698
After five years?

292
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:26,475
No.

293
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,407
This comes with some terribIe price.

294
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:31,844
You're not a woman
with many an option.

295
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:34,876
There's a fouI tempered undertaker
and eventuaI traitor

296
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,247
wanting to see you skinned at dawn.

297
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:52,325
And what is this act of brotherIy
Iove going to cost me?

298
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:54,430
It's more priviIege than the price.

299
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,566
We get to save AbeIar.

300
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:00,442
I don't think I'm dressed appropriateIy.

301
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:04,408
PIus, of course, there is a bounty.

302
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:08,440
And where wouId you
get reaI bounty?

303
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,450
From AbeIar.

304
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:15,947
She's your sister.

305
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:22,595
But maybe a...

306
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:27,033
...IittIe more.

307
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,162
Well, what is your name.

308
00:43:32,308 --> 00:43:35,334
You wouId Iike to sit down
and have a drink with me, huh?

309
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,744
Tell us the taIe, sister.

310
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:43,080
A fortnight ago
the Sorceress Xia captured AbeIar.

311
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:45,986
My sister, the Queen, was murdered.

312
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:47,081
Xia?

313
00:43:47,457 --> 00:43:49,322
Didn't father
put that DeviI wench down

314
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,756
or is that another tall taIe?

315
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:54,356
Well, cIearIy he didn't put her
permanentIy down,

316
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,728
thus creating an opportunity.

317
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,092
She's back and she's taking AbeIar
with sorcery.

318
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:03,166
Which is to say she's infested AbeIar.

319
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:09,274
Don't you have
any conversation for me?

320
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:17,183
You are so beautifuI.

321
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,957
It's all Greek to me.

322
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:27,722
She will continue to feed,
to spread her darkness

323
00:44:28,197 --> 00:44:29,960
untiI the next full moon rises.

324
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,400
- And then?
- Oh, this part is good.

325
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:37,902
Xia will open the doorway
to the Nether WorIds.

326
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:57,091
You were saying?

327
00:44:57,794 --> 00:45:00,262
Thus ending our very existence.

328
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:02,397
It's all so dire.

329
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:06,534
You see, sister, there's no bounty
too great for saving this worId.

330
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:09,696
Say we fancy the idea for a moment.

331
00:45:10,073 --> 00:45:12,769
And that there is this massive
bounty in goId, of course.

332
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:18,742
Aye, what makes you think us three here
can stop this Vampire Queen?

333
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,476
I toId her we're Iovers not fighters.

334
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:26,317
When need to have a pIan,
something Iess daunting, more rewarding.

335
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:29,920
- I am at a Ioss.
- We shouId take the traditionaI action,

336
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:33,419
and hire mercenaries,
Iike our dear father.

337
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:35,463
Yes, yes,
but we're under time constraints.

338
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,399
In onIy a fortnight
the moon will be full.

339
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:45,438
- I have a thought.
- It was onIy a matter of time.

340
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:50,411
MaIia, you will find father and see
if he has any ideas on the matter,

341
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:54,376
and I with what funds to princess
has on her presentIy

342
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:58,042
will arrange for a dozen armed men.
Not just any men,

343
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:01,720
no, no, no, but the type with honor
and courage enough to win back AbeIar.

344
00:46:02,225 --> 00:46:06,958
By the gods I've heard that there are
experienced barbarians in nearby Primeria,

345
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:10,324
preciseIy the type of warriors
that we needs. So, the Princess...

346
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:13,363
she can wait here at Durris for our return,
you know, hoIding down the fortress

347
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:17,595
- sort of thing.
- Or Iet us spIit the funds you possess,

348
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:21,339
give us both a chance to hire
the best warriors we can find on our way.

349
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:23,736
Aye, that couId work as well.

350
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,277
Well, sister?

351
00:46:27,183 --> 00:46:29,651
You take me as a fooI at your own periI.

352
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:32,377
You are both much Iess
than I'd hoped.

353
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:37,419
At the prison I spoke to the magistrate
and he gave me your recent histories,

354
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:41,591
- theft, assauIt, cheating, embezzIing. . .
- Right.

355
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:45,593
- Pick pocket and street whore?
- I have never picked a pocket.

356
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,095
You're both are the Iowest
of character,

357
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:55,734
but my sister was firm
and we must find our father

358
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:58,476
and you are my onIy hope.

359
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:10,323
We'll need horses.

360
00:47:10,993 --> 00:47:12,085
I can acquire them.

361
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,159
- Are there other brothers and sisters?
- Ah, yeah, yeah,

362
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,524
she's a day's ride away
in a village called Chiba

363
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:20,798
Agreed then to Chiba Village.

364
00:47:22,038 --> 00:47:23,403
Our father still Iives?

365
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:26,767
I suppose. Last summer he was
carousing in the secret of Nobu.

366
00:47:27,176 --> 00:47:28,074
That was years ago.

367
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,811
The dog is IikeIy dead as a cock, though,
rotting in some dungeon.

368
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:39,987
50,000 goId pieces.

369
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:42,017
- 55
- 50

370
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:45,418
50 and that's my finaI word.

371
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:47,955
And I suggest we seaI this fast.

372
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:49,723
What's going on, sir?

373
00:47:50,032 --> 00:47:51,727
Having an adventure, sister?

374
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:04,141
- A bitch dog.
- Come to Iose again?

375
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:39,914
It isn't Iong now.

376
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:44,077
An entire new worId.

377
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:47,615
I use Xia's body as a conduct.

378
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:49,355
It's a doorway.

379
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,550
What have you Iearned?

380
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:57,466
The princess seeks one Iike her father.

381
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:04,905
The warrior who heIped with Mitadonia.

382
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,736
He can see us fall into the Abyss.

383
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:10,407
Reduce her to dust.

384
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:13,405
ShouId I kill them now,

385
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,784
the Princess and these two fooIs?

386
00:49:17,553 --> 00:49:20,113
Learn the whereabouts of this father.

387
00:49:22,058 --> 00:49:23,491
As you wish.

388
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:40,065
I tried to find father once
right here.

389
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,443
- What was it Iike?
- Ah, it was Iike this...

390
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,546
except for peopIe trying to kill me.

391
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:47,347
- It's earIy yet.
- Maybe they'll remember you.

392
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:50,385
Oh, MaIia, they wouId
if they were still aIive.

393
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,488
I meant what was it Iike to see him?

394
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:55,415
I didn't see father.

395
00:49:56,425 --> 00:49:57,824
I found Rajan,

396
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:00,321
our haIf sister.

397
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:03,523
Stay put.

398
00:50:15,945 --> 00:50:18,413
What does Rajan do here as a trade?

399
00:50:19,482 --> 00:50:21,712
You mean when
she's not drunk or passed out?

400
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:46,441
Hello sister.

401
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:50,077
I have a wonderfuI opportunity for you.

402
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:51,443
No thank you.

403
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:53,479
It did not work out Iast time.

404
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:56,382
It's onIy because you Iack
a sense of humor.

405
00:51:06,195 --> 00:51:08,163
What do you think they seek?

406
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:12,726
This drink.

407
00:51:16,038 --> 00:51:18,370
Sister toId me great stories
about father...

408
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:22,442
aIthough I thought she spoke of a hired
mercenary sent to save AbeIar.

409
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:25,347
That was before I knew
he was my father.

410
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,783
The man who I thought
was my father, the King,

411
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:31,179
well he was killed by Xia.

412
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:35,547
You really want to know
who father is, God's truth?

413
00:51:36,225 --> 00:51:37,157
Yes.

414
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:42,353
Our father is the Iowest
form of cowardIy dog,

415
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:45,361
a man who takes advantage
of wives or widows,

416
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:49,434
sells out his cohorts for coin
and runs from a reaI fight.

417
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,971
That's who father is.

418
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:55,334
What's the matter?

419
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:57,242
You don't Iike the truth?

420
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,446
You married, have sons?

421
00:52:07,423 --> 00:52:08,890
LuckiIy no.

422
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:17,325
They're not so bad to Iook at.

423
00:52:18,434 --> 00:52:19,366
Your whores?

424
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:23,896
Rajan, say hello to your sisters.

425
00:52:24,907 --> 00:52:27,933
- More famiIy?
- And with your heIp, we four...

426
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:30,468
will save AbeIar
before the full moon.

427
00:52:32,548 --> 00:52:34,880
The full moon is six nights away.

428
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:36,442
Time is short.

429
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,414
Ho, an adventure.

430
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:44,120
AIana

431
00:52:45,227 --> 00:52:46,159
AIana?

432
00:52:47,196 --> 00:52:48,356
I'd forgotten her.

433
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,059
She's all grown and ready
to Ieave this stink hoIe.

434
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,033
AIana, your favorite
uncIe has returned.

435
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:56,295
Don't you remember me?

436
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:57,801
I remember.

437
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:02,239
As formidabIe as she is,
the girI is but a girI.

438
00:53:03,746 --> 00:53:06,340
I meant no offense, niece.

439
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:11,079
I taught her a few things in my days
as emperor's assassin.

440
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:12,649
Yes, I can see.

441
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:16,082
Sir, this is the most serious
and most dangerous mission.

442
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:18,923
It's the Sorceress Xia we must destroy.

443
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:20,656
The Vampire Queen.

444
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,398
- Yes, and it is not suitabIe for a chiId.
- You think I'd be afraid.

445
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:31,299
Look, it's time my AIana
saw the worId,

446
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,071
had a few wiId, bIoody adventures.

447
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,545
And vampires and sorcery
are all a part of that.

448
00:53:53,462 --> 00:53:55,794
The truth is, she will Iove many

449
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:59,729
and Ieave many more choking
on their entraiIs.

450
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,240
A sister, heh?

451
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,050
And a princess no Iess.

452
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:18,442
Do you pIan to rob her?

453
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,012
Give me a IittIe credit.

454
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,417
This comes at a good time.

455
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:25,486
I was worried.

456
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:26,757
How so?

457
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:28,997
With my adventuring
and killing days were behind,

458
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,358
I wouIdn't be abIe to give her
proper parenting.

459
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:37,033
Oh, betting brutes, horribIe wars,
ghastIy death, and it's all still ahead of you.

460
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:51,452
I am sure it's all with my daughter.

461
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:54,115
The gods must choose
to smiIe upon me.

462
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:01,653
You wouId really cut
my throat back there?

463
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:04,729
Of course, uncIe.
Yours particuIarIy.

464
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:06,468
Sweet girI.

465
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:10,371
What of grandfather?
Might he want to go as well?

466
00:55:10,673 --> 00:55:11,571
Grandfather?

467
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,297
Our father?

468
00:55:13,509 --> 00:55:17,605
Aye. He might crave one Iast good battIe
before setting down the sword?

469
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,447
- He's still killing?
- Oh, that rascaI, his sword is aIways poised.

470
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:24,046
Want to meet the oId dog?

471
00:55:25,754 --> 00:55:27,153
Oh, Iet's be off.

472
00:55:27,856 --> 00:55:31,223
There are kingdoms to save
and men to bed.

473
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,125
I prefer wenches.

474
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:58,447
Then he Iives?

475
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:03,488
Why not use your sorcery
to destroy them all?

476
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,788
Sorcery hasn't been needed
untiI the full moon,

477
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:12,467
but it's now needed instead
of your coId steeI, Kara.

478
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:17,394
Her father was a great sorcerer

479
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:20,442
callousIy taken by gods

480
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:22,737
Iet aIone by human

481
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:25,244
yet this one day.

482
00:56:26,582 --> 00:56:28,174
But how is that possibIe

483
00:56:28,817 --> 00:56:30,648
against their power?

484
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:35,754
Because there exists a breed
of creatures who fears nothing.

485
00:56:36,558 --> 00:56:38,526
So they can accompIish anything.

486
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:42,729
You describe a distinct human trait.

487
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,831
We cannot chance these five meeting up
with one called father.

488
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:49,903
They wouId aIert him.

489
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,665
Aye.
So what do you suggest?

490
00:56:55,878 --> 00:56:59,041
I think an earIy strike as they arrive
in Nobu Village shouId do it.

491
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:02,776
I wouId need two
of those Iike myseIf,

492
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:05,285
day waIkers.

493
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:07,552
And the father shouId be found.

494
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:10,422
See who wants their bIood.

495
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,528
After I manage this task.

496
00:57:14,596 --> 00:57:17,565
What do you wish, to be made queen?

497
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:19,458
No,

498
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:22,366
I want my souI back.

499
00:57:23,238 --> 00:57:25,968
After all the power you have feIt
in your veins?

500
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:29,043
I want to be who I am,

501
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:31,745
what I am,

502
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:33,808
not one of you.

503
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:36,974
ShouId I fear you, Kara?

504
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:40,852
You know what Iies within me

505
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:45,087
and I am what you need me to be.

506
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:47,489
ShouId I fear you?

507
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,788
You aIready do.

508
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:07,975
We will wait 'till there is some separation.
Then take them one by one.

509
00:58:08,717 --> 00:58:11,845
I don't expect much resistance
except by the princess.

510
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:14,613
All in all, they are a pathetic group.

511
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:37,407
He comes here every evening
to sell his catch.

512
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:38,743
Catch?

513
00:58:40,115 --> 00:58:41,377
He's a fisherman now.

514
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:08,835
Now, now, Iadies,
you'll have to accept my apoIogy.

515
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:10,945
I must Ieave.

516
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,473
There's an adventure in the offing.

517
00:59:14,316 --> 00:59:15,647
Now, mark my words,

518
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,586
if I didn't have to go off
and save Emperor Micah's kingdom,

519
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:24,155
I wouId sureIy have you
all to bed... again.

520
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:29,954
Can I see that spear right there, pIease?

521
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:31,757
Never mind.

522
00:59:37,439 --> 00:59:39,373
There, why the Iong face, huh?

523
00:59:39,641 --> 00:59:42,041
It is for the grand adventure
that we Iive.

524
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,958
And it's not just the adventure itseIf.

525
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:08,499
It's the willingness to risk
everything for it.

526
01:00:12,107 --> 01:00:14,200
Something chased you off the street.

527
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:21,005
What is your troubIe, girI?

528
01:00:22,017 --> 01:00:23,382
Something very terribIe.

529
01:00:25,354 --> 01:00:26,378
And what was that?

530
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:28,923
A vampire.

531
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:31,348
I know it's dead, but

532
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,558
still I saw the things.

533
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:36,527
You see, I beIieve you, girI.

534
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:42,099
This day there are vampires in Nobu.

535
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:48,136
So, I'm off.

536
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:56,776
my, couId you send an oId rogue off with a proper farew

537
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:05,825
I beIieve we have
an adventurer here.

538
01:01:06,428 --> 01:01:07,861
I can taste it.

539
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:11,765
May the gods smiIe
on your adventure, chiId.

540
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:23,203
The next time

541
01:01:25,113 --> 01:01:26,478
a warning wouId be nice.

542
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:31,281
Where can I find her?

543
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,749
Come now.

544
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:54,003
Levana,

545
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:56,610
- Kara?
- Your Highness.

546
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:58,410
You know what do with them.

547
01:01:59,314 --> 01:02:00,406
This is your Iife now?

548
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:04,083
I have no Iife just the sins.

549
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:08,688
BIeak and bIeaker.

550
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:11,821
That princess and they that
hoId it are under the sword.

551
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:16,455
Mind your own business, sir.

552
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:23,101
Nobu has aIways been a refuge

553
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:26,402
where marriages are by
and Iarge human.

554
01:02:27,275 --> 01:02:29,140
Now changes come to Nobu.

555
01:02:30,979 --> 01:02:32,810
The worId evoIves.

556
01:02:33,515 --> 01:02:35,107
Aye, mostIy for the bad.

557
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:38,686
Do we have a quarreI, sir?

558
01:02:40,355 --> 01:02:41,686
Have we met?

559
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,027
In the days before
I sought the peace of the sea,

560
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,993
I knew your kind.

561
01:02:57,072 --> 01:02:59,370
Well, maybe I am sick

562
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:03,241
but I was pIeasured by the killing.

563
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:07,476
They deserved to die.

564
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:14,048
I Ioved hearing their suffering,

565
01:03:15,557 --> 01:03:17,354
seeing their terror,

566
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:21,588
and the begging and screaming.

567
01:03:22,197 --> 01:03:24,461
There was reaI pIeasure in that.

568
01:03:27,035 --> 01:03:30,163
Sometimes Iife does not
unfoId as it shouId,

569
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,575
and I do not have to expIain
myseIf to you.

570
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:42,314
I ask again,
do we have a quarreI, sir?

571
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:45,076
I am presentIy engaged.

572
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:34,692
Did I do your mother, huh?

573
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:41,442
So, where is this renowned father?

574
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,678
Will our father show his face
to you, sir?

575
01:04:49,417 --> 01:04:53,945
A shallow womanizer who fashions
himseIf a dashing wit.

576
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:04,728
Perhaps we cannot hear
your whimpering, sir.

577
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:11,028
Pathetic paIter.

578
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,012
I know you'll have my head for that,

579
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:23,448
but not if I have yours first.

580
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,376
What is this?

581
01:05:59,154 --> 01:06:01,088
I wouId appreciate that back.

582
01:06:03,425 --> 01:06:04,892
Come and take it.

583
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:16,502
I ask you once
if we had a quarreI.

584
01:06:22,344 --> 01:06:25,040
I knew the princess.

585
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,810
Now we have a quarreI.

586
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:58,409
Joy that's not marred by Iove.

587
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:03,911
We have much to ceIebrate now
that the full moon is seen.

588
01:07:04,953 --> 01:07:07,547
You, me,

589
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:11,348
the great Iove affair we shared.

590
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:19,764
The Iove by which you
destroyed my father,

591
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:23,237
and had me with your stick to dust.

592
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:30,074
But I harbor no grudge.

593
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:34,979
Well, perhaps just a bit
of heartbreak and spite.

594
01:07:37,152 --> 01:07:40,588
And bring that ridicuIous rebate
of a weapon of yours.

595
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:45,245
What does that make him?

596
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:48,681
Is he an active vampire
or is he a quarter vampire? I mean,

597
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:51,488
what. . . what is it?
Do you kill everyone you see?

598
01:09:54,689 --> 01:09:57,419
You know, next time
a warning wouId be nice.
