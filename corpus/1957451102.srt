MAN: What is it about plastic
surgery and facelifts?

14
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:33,367
What's your sense
of that whole world?

15
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,934
Well, that's a very
polite way of asking me,

16
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:38,967
I'm sure, have you had
a facelift? Ha ha!

17
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:43,900
Well, if you had the
ceiling falling down
in your living room,

18
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,166
would you not go
and have a repair?

19
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:54,233
WOMAN: As much as you like it
or don't like it,

20
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,467
it's a woman's business.

21
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:58,700
The men were accessory
to the fact.

22
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,500
I have seen so many girls
come and go

23
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,867
because they have nothing
going on inside.

24
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:12,667
MAN: This wasn't just about
the physical beauty.

25
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,967
They had character.

26
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,800
They had personality.

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,233
They had something inside
that came through.

28
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:26,367
WOMAN:
When you get older, you build
something else in your core

29
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:29,800
which goes beyond the physical,
because it has to.

30
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:35,333
MAN: This is simple.
Nothing in your face.

31
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,700
Looking here.

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,800
Beautiful.
Raise the bounce.

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
WOMAN:
I'm Carmen Dell'Orifice.

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,934
I have been a Ford Model
since 1947.

35
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,800
MAN: This is an amazing Avedon,

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,834
and you've never liked yourself
in it.

37
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:54,567
CARMEN DELL'ORIFICE:
You know why?

38
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,400
Because I don't like my feet.

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,934
They're just not sexy feet.

40
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:04,867
My mother used to say,
"You have feet like coffins
and ears like Sedan doors."

41
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:07,567
I internalized that.

42
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:12,300
For women in the '40s
and during World War II,

43
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,333
a nurse was very high level,
a teacher.

44
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:22,867
There was the dubious profession
of being an actress then,
slash-model.

45
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:27,367
What is...Model didn't really
exist as a profession.

46
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:30,633
It was really model/hooker.

47
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:36,033
This is in the days
when the Duchess of Windsor

48
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,900
and Mrs. William Rhinelander,
Mrs. Hearst,

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,567
and all these ladies who went
to Europe 4 times a year

50
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:45,166
to have their clothes
custom made.

51
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:49,433
Because of World War II,
that stopped.

52
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,200
WOMAN: Hello girls.
Having fun?

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,700
Certainly is a lovely day.

54
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,066
DELL'ORIFICE:
Advertising was beginning.

55
00:03:56,066 --> 00:04:00,266
We began to dress ourselves.

56
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:09,400
am this young, comatose child
who was 5'9" and weighed under
100 pounds.

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:18,100
I had already worked for
Clifford Coffin, Irving Penn,
Cecil Beaton, Jaffe Balkan.

58
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,300
But who knows one
is living history
when one is just living it?

59
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,900
I got by and I fit in, making
money.

60
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,967
You know, to live my little
life, send my mother to college,

61
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,967
do all the things I wanted
by my first husband.

62
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:38,533
All the lovely things
that models did in those days.

63
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,500
MAN: Let me see
how this looks.

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,000
Beautiful.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,033
You're gonna be
looking at me here.
Yeah.

66
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,367
So this is sort of your
your favorite side anyhow.

67
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,400
Yeah, I have...
I like both.

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,467
Ha ha!

69
00:04:54,066 --> 00:05:01,266
We had light, space,
the photographic studios
are beautiful places.

70
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,066
When I looked at how
other people had to work,

71
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:07,867
going into an office,
staying in a cubicle,
it was incredible.

72
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:13,667
A world of wonderful people,
also very eccentric.

73
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,066
The hairdresser,
the makeup artist.

74
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:21,033
I don't think they can
live in any other places
but the fashion world.

75
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:28,266
I'm too old to have grown up
with the idea that a woman
should have a career.

76
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:30,834
Of course you would work,
but not a career.

77
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:34,967
Your family would come first
and...and then you'll adjust.

78
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,700
Not to bother your husband with,
"Oh, can I...

79
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,000
can you buy me that dress?"

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
You'll have that little bit
of money.

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,667
My mother, of course,
had a huge career.

82
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:47,967
But my mother's career was
seen as a special gift,
like a calling.

83
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,867
You know, like a nun
who has to go to a nunnery.

84
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:54,667
For sure, I didn't look at
myself in the mirror and say,
"You know what?

85
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,967
I have that look
that I could be a model."

86
00:05:56,967 --> 00:06:00,500
It was completely...
a chance.

87
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,200
I worked with Bruce Webber,
who I just knew socially.

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
And he had asked me to pose
for some photos.

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
And I did because I thought,

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,500
"Oh, I'll buy many copies
and I'll keep these copies
for my grandchildren."

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,767
One day, when I'm old, I'll say,
"Look, I looked good."

92
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,667
Modeling taught me
that it was essential for women

93
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:24,834
not to depend on fathers
and husbands.

94
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:28,300
Modeling provided me
that financial independent

95
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,900
and that career, that discipline
that a career requires.

96
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,934
That you do know where you're
gonna be 8 months from now.

97
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:36,066
That you have to go to sleep
early.

98
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,533
That you can't eat that food.

99
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,467
I've got 28 covers of "Vogue."

100
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:45,900
9 of them were shot by Richard
Avedon and had changed my life.

101
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,867
If you were a fashion model
like Barbie,

102
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,000
you'd lead a different life
every day of the week.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,834
WOMAN: Two of my older sisters
were modeling at the Apparel
Mart in Dallas.

104
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,567
It was about the fantasy
of beauty,

105
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:03,300
the fantasy of glamour,
the fantasy of this other life

106
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,700
that we would see in these
old black and white movies
and things.

107
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,500
I started my working career
in Texas at the Dairy Queen.

108
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,333
My mother used to say to me,

109
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,467
'cause I used to be really upset
about not having a boyfriend.

110
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:20,133
I used to say,
"Oh, I feel like a failure."

111
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,767
You know, "What am I gonna do?"

112
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:26,266
And she used to say,
"Well, look at Twiggy.

113
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:31,734
Twiggy's a model and she's even
skinnier and flatter
than you are."

114
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:34,133
And so, I was supposed
to go to...

115
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,834
Paris with my French club
in school.

116
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:42,000
And my mom made me
all these wonderful clothes.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,734
We used to get the Frederick's
of Hollywood catalog.

118
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:47,633
So they were all copies of
Frederick's of Hollywood.

119
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,400
They're like snake skin
and red satin.

120
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,700
They went very, very tight to
the knees and then flared out.

121
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,667
Or they had, like, panels, like
snake skin with your legs would
come through with these panels.

122
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:04,200
We thought that Paris was
like that.

123
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,767
My French club trip
fell through.

124
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,433
But I had a car accident where...

125
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:13,166
they gave me penicillin,
which I was allergic to.

126
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:17,467
So the hospital said,
"If you don't sue us,
we'll give you $800."

127
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:20,700
So I said, "Ok."

128
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,767
Got to Paris and my mother said,
"The Riviera's the place to go."

129
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,266
My first day on the beach,

130
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:34,433
I bought a pink
metallic crocheted bikini
and some platform shoes.

131
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,233
This was the early '70s.

132
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,600
And they had painted cork heels.

133
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,900
When I put them on,
I was 6'4" or 5" or something.

134
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,467
And I had slept in pin curls,
you know,

135
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,433
little tiny pin curls
with a bobby pin.

136
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,467
So when I took it out,
it was like that.

137
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:52,600
I was actually expecting to
be discovered.

138
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,934
And I was, within,
like, an hour.

139
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,533
A guy came up to me and said,
"Would you like to be a model?"

140
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,400
I said, "Yes." Ha!

141
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:09,333
WOMAN:
When I was a child, I dreamt of
becoming an artist in France.

142
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,266
And before I could even
speak French,

143
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,667
I went around
speaking fake French.

144
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,700
I guess you could say I was
a rather strange child.

145
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,300
I was working as
a struggling artist in Paris,

146
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,834
painting, like, the scenes
in Montmartre.

147
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:27,300
And I had my little dog
in the bag going, "Don't
worry, baby. I will..."

148
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,934
I had a fake French accent.

149
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:31,667
Then I would say, "Don't worry
my little baby.
I will help you.

150
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,967
And then smack.

151
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:36,133
Right into a photographer named
Errol Sawyer.

152
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:40,467
For many, many, many,
many, many years,

153
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,333
I thought, "I'll do maybe
another two months of this

154
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,133
and then I'll go back
to my real life."

155
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:48,200
But you get to collaborate
with amazing people and...

156
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
and wear great clothes and...

157
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,433
better clothes nowadays
than in the '80s.

158
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:57,266
It's a fun job.

159
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:02,900
WOMAN: I didn't have success
as a model

160
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,533
like models have success today
or yesterday.

161
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:10,033
I had success because I was
known in a small little arena

162
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:14,800
called the Garment District
area, where designers book
runway models.

163
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,767
And I kept a full-time job
the whole time.

164
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:22,266
You know, you come from...
a neighborhood of people
with style.

165
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:26,066
Even if it's just about the guys
on the corner, you know,

166
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,033
the way they talk shit
and what they have on.

167
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:29,567
And you notice
the double pleated pants.

168
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,333
You notice the shoe.

169
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,233
You notice your uncle
when he comes in, what he wears.

170
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,567
I'll never forget.

171
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,233
My mother walks in
with 3 guys.

172
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,834
And they say, "Hi, Beth Ann.
Hi, Beth Ann.
Hi, Beth Ann."

173
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:44,433
They would all be talking
in the back room and dressing
and doing and talking.

174
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,066
I didn't know
what they were doing.

175
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:48,934
But when they would leave,
she'd leave with 3 women.

176
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,767
I couldn't put it together then.

177
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,233
I just knew that
they came in as guys

178
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:57,700
and then they seemed to have
gone out in my mother's clothes
as women.

179
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,934
You have these kind of
experiences in your life.

180
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,400
You just basically...
you're...you're sort of...

181
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,500
you're sort of, like, propelled
into whatever you want to do.

182
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,033
Ha ha!
Nobody's saying, "You can't.

183
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,834
Don't you dare."

184
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:15,867
My mother told me that I used
to tell her I was modeling.

185
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,800
And she used to smile and,
"Oh, that's nice."

186
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
And then I did a commercial.

187
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,967
And she saw me on TV,
and she was stunned.

188
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:29,166
And she honestly told me that
she always thought when I said I
was a model that I was a hooker.

189
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,133
And she said,
"Oh, you really are a model."

190
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,567
And I said, "Well, yeah,
what did you think?"

191
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,033
She said,
"I have to be honest with you.

192
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,600
I thought was just the way
you were explaining..."

193
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,567
Ha!

194
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,967
Nowadays, everybody wants
their child to model.

195
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:47,300
Back in the day, nobody wanted
anybody to be a model.

196
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,200
WOMAN: ♪ I'm waiting for a boat
to help me out of here ♪

197
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,834
♪ Mmm ♪

198
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,367
♪ Waiting for a boat to... ♪

199
00:11:56,367 --> 00:12:00,800
WOMAN: I started modeling
in the early '50s.

200
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,700
I was paid $100 a month,

201
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,567
and I was the highest paid model
in Europe.

202
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:12,266
The ones who are top models,
each one of us, of course,
had to have kind of a walk.

203
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,600
And I was famous for my walk.

204
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:26,200
And Hookah, this friend of mine,
used to walk like this.

205
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,233
There was no music.
There was nothing.

206
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,333
You just walked in
and you walked out.

207
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,066
You didn't allow the buyers
to touch your dress,

208
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,900
because they were trying
to feel underneath

209
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,233
to see what was inside.

210
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:45,200
And so, you walked
like you had an attitude.

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Like, "Don't touch me."

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,867
Not a smile on your face.

213
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:51,767
You walked in
and you walked out.

214
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,767
I don't wear makeup normally.

215
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,066
But if I know I'm going
to have a shoot like this,

216
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm going to try and look
as good as I can

217
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,533
because what about all the
other girls in the damn shoot,

218
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,734
Right? I'm gonna look like
some dumb dumb? No.

219
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:04,967
I have never exercised
in my life.

220
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,633
I can't even touch my toes.

221
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,433
I've never dieted.

222
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:11,633
I never really thought of myself
as a model.

223
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,767
It was just a job.

224
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:19,667
WOMAN: Style is sort of
an expression of yourself.

225
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:23,433
It gives people the possibility
to be creative

226
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,200
and to express themselves
in ways

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,767
that maybe they can't express
themself in words sometimes.

228
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,467
My grandmother was this
incredible artist.

229
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:36,266
MAN: Might you be known
as a famous designer
of ladies' dresses?

230
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:40,600
You're getting hot.

231
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,934
Well, I only know two or three
dress makers,

232
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:45,633
so I'll take a chance
at Scaparelli.

233
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,033
That's the right...

234
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,767
[Applause]

235
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,367
MARISA BERENSON:
She was a total rebel.

236
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,500
When she was young,
she found herself ugly.

237
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,033
And so, one day,
she decided she was
going to change that

238
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:58,567
if she could.

239
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:03,800
And she planted seeds
in her nose and in her
mouth so that a...

240
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,166
flowers would grow out of
her nose and out of her ears.

241
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:12,300
She was very avant garde,

242
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,567
And she was truly an artist
more than just a designer.

243
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,533
So I grew up in that
environment, too, you know,

244
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,500
with all these
incredible people.

245
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,867
Dali and Cocteau and Vertez
and Picasso.

246
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,667
Dali wanted to paint me
in the nude when I was 13.

247
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:33,600
And my mother said, "Absolutely
not, you dirty old man."

248
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,367
"She has hip bones
like cherry stones," he said.

249
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:38,934
Ha ha!

250
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:45,467
My father took me to
one last coming out ball
with my sister Berry.

251
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:50,600
And at that ball was Diana
Vreeland, who I had known
since I was a very little girl.

252
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,700
And she was a great friend of
my grandmother's and my parents.

253
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,033
And she said,
"We have to photograph you."

254
00:14:57,033 --> 00:15:03,033
And from then on in, you know,
I worked for "Vogue"
for 6 years solid.

255
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:08,333
I was never told
I was beautiful.

256
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,133
At school,
I was called Olive Oyl,

257
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:13,333
you know, because I was long
and lanky.

258
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,467
My mother used to say,
"You know,

259
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:19,066
you look like a Modigliani
and Berry looks like a Renoir."

260
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,166
And I'd look at Modigliani
paintings and I'd start to cry.

261
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,834
And I'd say, "I look like that?

262
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:26,400
That's the saddest thing
and the most depressing thing
I've ever seen."

263
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,066
I used to cut out all these
wonderful actresses at the time.

264
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:36,433
You know, people like Audrey
Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich and
Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner.

265
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:39,033
And think, "God, you know,
I wish I looked like that."

266
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:42,300
It's a handicap in
the acting world to be a model.

267
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,800
You're always thought
as brainless.

268
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,266
You have to prove yourself
much more than somebody who's
just started out acting.

269
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:55,000
To work with all those
great people in my life,

270
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,633
Bisconti, Bob Fosse, Stanley
Kubrick, it was just a dream.

271
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,567
WOMAN: My father collected up
all the photos that he could
of me.

272
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,166
Hang on a second. Ha!

273
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:17,767
These were my covers
he collected. Ha!

274
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:21,734
My mother, after 27 years...
Hang on. There's more.

275
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:30,600
My mother, after 27 or 28 years
after my father's death, finally
gave me my father's books.

276
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,367
When I walked in
for my first job,

277
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,100
I waited two hours
to see the editor.

278
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,300
I was behind time on my...
go-sees.

279
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,433
She walked in.
She said...

280
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,967
"Who cut your hair?
Your eyebrows look like shit.

281
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,633
And you're too big for
our clothes." Ha!

282
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:52,800
But the photographer
was John Stember.

283
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,233
And John said, "No, absolutely
not. She's staying."

284
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,800
And they fought over it.

285
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,767
And I had to stand there
while they were screaming
at each other,

286
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,934
this 17-, 18-year-old kid.

287
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,967
And when I walked off the set

288
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,100
, that same editor said,
"You lose 15 pounds,

289
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,700
I'll take you to the collections
in Italy."

290
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,266
I starved.

291
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,433
I starved.

292
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,600
I mean, an apple here,
a carrot there.

293
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,433
The minute you hit the ground,
they would get you up at 5:00
in the morning.

294
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,900
You'd work till 12:00,
1:00 at night.

295
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,033
You'd get back up at 5:00
the next morning.

296
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,266
I was there for 10 days.

297
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,600
And when I got off the plane,

298
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,066
I was waiting in the airport for
my mother to come pick me up.

299
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,066
And...Ha!

300
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:35,567
I burst into tears 'cause she
walked by me, like, 6 times.

301
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,700
She didn't recognize me.

302
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,600
And when she looked at me,
she had such a horrified look
on her face.

303
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,333
And I was like, "What?

304
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,300
What are you looking at me
like that for?"

305
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,333
I was pale and green
from working so hard

306
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,600
and not having eaten anything.

307
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
And I was exhausted.

308
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,834
WOMAN: I started modeling
at the age of 15

309
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,066
already knowing
that the camera lies.

310
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:02,734
My parents escaped to Sweden
from the Czech Republic in 1968.

311
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:05,934
My parents used press,
Swedish press, in...

312
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,467
in order to try to get me out of
the Czech Republic.

313
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,133
That really didn't work at all,

314
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,100
but it made them really famous
in Sweden.

315
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,066
It also made me famous
in Sweden.

316
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,433
And there would be
these Swedish journalists

317
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,400
coming down to the Czech
Republic taking pictures of me.

318
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
And they always made me hold
my teddy bear.

319
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,333
And...you know, and would
sort of try to indicate to me
in Swedish,

320
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,633
which, of course,
I couldn't understand,
that I should look sad.

321
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:31,700
You know, I'd...I'd be hugging my
teddy bear and looking like...

322
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,433
[Sighs]

323
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:36,734
And that's pretty much
how I felt about the camera
ever since actually.

324
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:41,834
I was sort of already tagging
this big bag of history with me

325
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,333
because I had been called
a dirty communist

326
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,467
asshole bastard, whatever,
in school for...for years.

327
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:54,000
And so, when I had a chance
to escape that, to want to be
a beautiful model,

328
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,166
I don't think
there's any 15-year-old girl

329
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:01,533
that will turn down the chance
to be called beautiful.

330
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:05,934
You don't realize at that point
that you're also going to get
called ugly.

331
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:09,300
And they would open my book
with my...

332
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,133
my portfolio with my pictures in
and start discussing me,

333
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,567
start kind of cutting me apart.

334
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,133
"Hmmm, good nose.
Yeah, those teeth.

335
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,633
Oh my God, what are we gonna do
about those teeth?"

336
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,667
"Well, you just don't make her
open her mouth."

337
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,900
"Hmmm, I don't like the color
of her hair."

338
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,800
"Yeah, well, that can be fixed.
But what about those thighs?

339
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,000
We can't do anything
about those."

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,533
Every job felt like it was going
to be my last.

341
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:36,600
That people would actually
put me in, you know,

342
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,667
somebody's else's clothes
in front of a camera

343
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:41,700
always made me feel like I was
playing a very dangerous game.

344
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,600
I thought very quickly they
would find out that I'm really
just a political refugee.

345
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,066
And then they would
send me back.

346
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:51,433
And we did a lot of
really nice pictures

347
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:54,000
that then when I would see
the picture, I'd go, "Oh, look.

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,433
She looks good."

349
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:59,467
It was never really me.

350
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:03,033
The feeling is that it's like
you're not even really there.

351
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,600
It's not about yourself

352
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,900
or really how you look
or anything like that.

353
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,600
It's what the person perceives
from you.

354
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,300
My mother is a painter.

355
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,633
And when I was a little girl,
she said, "Pose for me."

356
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,567
And I sat on the bed,
and I opened a book.

357
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,667
And I just sat there.

358
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,233
And for the first time
in my life,

359
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:29,500
I felt really, really peaceful
because I was being appreciated.

360
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,133
And I saw creativity happening.

361
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:39,100
The way it was then, it was
either you were blonde
or you were very black.

362
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
And I didn't fit anywhere.

363
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,800
I'm 1/8 black, Irish, Cherokee,
English, Scottish, German.

364
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,400
Avedon used to say to me
all the time,

365
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,633
"Oh, you know, Pat,
I wanna use you much more.

366
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:54,967
But they just don't know what
you are."

367
00:20:54,967 --> 00:21:02,600
"Ebony Fashion Fair" is very
important because, at the time,

368
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,934
there were no magazines
for people of color.

369
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:11,767
And there were really
a lot of women in America
who were not being catered to.

370
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:15,266
And so, what Mrs. Johnson did
was create a fashion show

371
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:19,934
that she would take around
America to every state
in America.

372
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:25,767
It was very hard work,
especially when we got
to the South.

373
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:29,500
We stop in this bus,
this Greyhound bus

374
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,333
to go to the ladies room in this
sort of out-of-the-way place.

375
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,600
And they said, "No, you black
girls can't come in here."

376
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,166
But me, they said,
"You can use the bathroom."

377
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,900
We see these guys coming to the
bus, and they're really angry.

378
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,767
And they're, like, carrying,
like, sticks and stuff.

379
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,667
And the bus driver says,
"We've gotta get out of here."

380
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,000
The bus doesn't start.

381
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,867
They started banging on our bus.

382
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,700
They were trying
to turn our bus over.

383
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,900
And the bus driver was trying
to get the bus to go.

384
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,467
And it was so frightening.

385
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:03,633
And I kept peeking up to see
these ugly faces.

386
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:05,900
And that didn't happen
only once.

387
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,433
I was up at "Vogue" and they
took the picture for the cover.

388
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:15,233
And I thought, "Wow, I'm gonna
have a Vogue cover."

389
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:20,300
But...no, I wasn't blonde enough
or something.

390
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,500
I said, "I'm going to leave
the country.

391
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,166
And I'm not coming back here
until you have a black girl
on the cover."

392
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,600
Naomi Simms was perfect.

393
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,800
Danielle Luna was perfect.

394
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,300
When it's time to go,
you need to go because
you will find something new.

395
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:46,166
On the runway, it's as though
I'm lifting off the ground.

396
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:50,233
I just wanna hear drums playing
and express all of that.

397
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,967
A rhythm you feel in your soul,

398
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:55,166
like this music in your heart
starts beating fast,

399
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,400
and it's almost orgasmic.

400
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,900
When you move your body,
it's like it's dancing.

401
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:09,066
What you try to do is let them
appreciate what you're wearing
by being alive in it.

402
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,033
I love these shoes.
Glad I don't have to walk.

403
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,200
You just have to carry me over.

404
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,667
Ok, I'm ready to move...

405
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:29,367
You do live in a bubble,
where everyone tells you

406
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,700
how beautiful you are
all the time.

407
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,934
And they run and get you coffee
or whatever you want.

408
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:39,233
I was the first African American
to grace the cover of "Vogue"

409
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:42,233
in August 1974.

410
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,433
Wow, that's a long time.

411
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,767
I found that...

412
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's see if we
can scan it.

413
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,533
Oh, and is this the one?
Is this it?

414
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:51,834
No.

415
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,867
Is it...
Is it...Is it...Nah.

416
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,367
Here's the actual...

417
00:23:55,367 --> 00:24:01,133
Ruth Whitney put together, like,
16 or 17 of my "Glamour" covers,

418
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:06,467
and on the front page, she wrote
something very special to me.

419
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:12,700
"Beverly, your covers always
meant something special to me

420
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
"because your face on the cover

421
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,500
"really did finally
change the way

422
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,133
"our white readers
thought of blacks.

423
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:24,100
Thanks for helping them along.
Ruth Whitney."

424
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,767
When I was modeling,
the career lasted 3 to 4 years.

425
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,934
That was your entire career.

426
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,300
And it was frightening.

427
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,033
I remember my girlfriend.

428
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:40,200
She's, like, graduating
from college and, you know,

429
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,233
getting married and putting
a down payment on the house.

430
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,767
Woman maturing and...and happy.

431
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:56,100
And here I am in fear and,
you know, supposedly living
this glamorous life.

432
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,166
I'm crippled, you know,
with the idea of...

433
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:03,066
of growing old and...
and where do I go next?

434
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:07,967
The whole age thing in our
industry, it's everything.

435
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:12,567
ROSSELLINI:
For me, the difference
was that I started at 28.

436
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:18,100
I think that gave me enough...
independence and substance.

437
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,633
Not that I was sure of myself.

438
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:22,166
Not that I looked at myself in
the mir...in a mirror and said,

439
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:27,233
"Mirror, mirror...ha...
on the wall, who's the
fairest of them all? Me."

440
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,600
I understood that it was
a career.

441
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,500
And I understood that
that was an image.

442
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,000
It wasn't me.

443
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And then people sometimes
confused it.

444
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,900
But, of course, that's part of
the success. It'll go. Ha!

445
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,767
So sometimes you'll
have to claim and say,

446
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:42,233
"Oh, but I...
I was that model." You know?

447
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,667
I think it's harder
when you're young.

448
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,700
Once you're gone and made up,

449
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,867
people forget that
you are 15, 16.

450
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:52,000
They think you are
a 20-year-old sex kitten.

451
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,500
And that's very difficult
to handle.

452
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,033
MAN: And were you
confident at that point?

453
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,500
I mean, you were
15 years old.

454
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,033
Did you kind of know
who you were?

455
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,400
Ha ha!

456
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,667
Show me a girl who is...

457
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,533
who knows who she is at 15
and I'll show you a freak.

458
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:10,200
I was a typical 15-year-old
as far as, you know,
completely insecure

459
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,367
and wanted to seem more grown up
than she actually was

460
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:17,600
by, you know, smoking
and playing really hard
and drinking too much.

461
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,700
And, you know, well, I'm...huh!

462
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,100
I arrived with girls
that were 16, 17.

463
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,700
And I could see what happened
to them.

464
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,934
I saw the ones
that fell by the roadside,

465
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:31,433
the ones that got into drugs,

466
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,800
the ones that had to go home

467
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,333
because they became bulimic or
anorexic or, you know, whatever.

468
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,066
And you sort of just look at it
and you go, "Uh-huh"

469
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,333
You know, because as a kid,
you're very malleable.

470
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,767
You know, like, you know,

471
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:46,834
you can be put in a room
for 10 years and told
that that's normal.

472
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,600
And you'll go, "Oh, ok."

473
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,333
What people called
sexual harassment,
we called compliments.

474
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:56,533
You know, when a 16-year-old
is flattered by a man

475
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,767
pulling out his penis
in front of her, that's...

476
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,033
you know, that's kind
of noteworthy.

477
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:05,667
WOMAN:
A lot of these girls were kids.

478
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,300
And with a little hair, makeup,

479
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,100
being surround by
sophisticated people, you know,

480
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,233
we made them into something
they weren't.

481
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:19,433
I think, unfortunately, you
know, we created a monster.

482
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,300
WOMAN: When I left New York,
I really left.

483
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,266
I left the scene.

484
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,266
I left drugs.

485
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:38,767
I left the fast lane,
the jet-set.

486
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,934
Where I grew up
in Center Island, Oyster Bay,

487
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:47,867
was a very secluded life,

488
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:50,033
very protected,
over protected.

489
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:51,400
seriously over protected.

490
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,033
We had a lot of help,
a lot of money, grounds.

491
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:58,133
I mean, now that I look at it,
I get it, Dad.

492
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:02,500
I get why you guys
wanted to be there
as much as I wanted to leave.

493
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,533
When I got to New York,
I was really 16, not 19.

494
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,667
And I was really shy.

495
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:15,867
I remember one day asking an
editor, "How do you do this?"

496
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:20,000
And she said, "Go...go inside,
and Beverly Johnson's in there.

497
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,433
Ask her how to do it." Ha!

498
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,834
And I went in,
and Beverly said,

499
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:25,934
"Just...just act like
you're the most beautiful thing

500
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:28,567
that ever walked the earth."

501
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:31,400
And I went, "Ok." Ha.

502
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,934
That's not really my thing.

503
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:38,367
The camera became
an avenue and a permission

504
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:42,166
be the part of myself
that I needed to be

505
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,166
in order to do that work.

506
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,600
And without the camera, uh-uh.

507
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,567
Ha!

508
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:51,834
That's what Helmet had...
did for me.

509
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:57,667
He understood and loved
to make fun those people
from where I'm from,

510
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:00,700
the sort of blue blood
line of people.

511
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,467
That's why I was able
to work with him.

512
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:07,100
We were both laughing. At me.

513
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,867
I was afraid of that side of me.

514
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:11,400
I knew it was strong,

515
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,433
and I didn't know how
to appropriately use it
in real life.

516
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:18,166
There was an article written
in the "Daily News."

517
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:21,467
I think of this now,
and it really is upsetting.

518
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,033
But it was called
"The Dark Side of Modeling."

519
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:27,266
And it...it was a picture of me.

520
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:32,033
And I knew that my father
went home on the train
with the "Daily News"

521
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:35,100
and that that's what
he was gonna see.

522
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,667
It was in the '70s.

523
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:40,467
Everybody was doing drugs of
some sort, mostly cocaine.

524
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:44,433
And every...And there was
nothing known about it.

525
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:48,834
What was known was that
it's not addictive.

526
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:51,600
I was so insecure
that I needed to do it.

527
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,834
Made me feel like I...I was...

528
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,900
I had something to say,
that I was worth being
photographed, that I...

529
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,834
that I could...you know,
that I was somebody.

530
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,834
Because I really didn't think
I could do anything.

531
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:09,967
JADE HOBSON:
When drugs came on the scene,

532
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:11,667
the look of the girl changed.

533
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,734
You'd certainly stop smiling.

534
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,633
Photographs became more serious.

535
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:22,333
I was on a shoot with
Francesco Scavullo.

536
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,934
Gia was one of the models.

537
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:26,300
I used to use binoculars.

538
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,066
I used to stand behind
the photographer,

539
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:32,400
and I'd use binoculars to see
every detail on clothing.

540
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,934
And while I was looking the Gia,

541
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,800
I could see the track marks
on her arm.

542
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,934
And I...
I mean, Gia looked great.

543
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:44,934
And yeah, I feel
somewhat responsible.

544
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:51,600
The photographers, the whole
industry of using these girls
when we were aware

545
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,900
of...the heavy,
heavy use of drugs.

546
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,133
We maybe exploited these girls

547
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:05,066
because it also brought a
certain look to the photograph.

548
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:07,133
I don't know.

549
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:10,033
We were definitely
out of it then.

550
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,600
We just weren't hip enough.

551
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,734
In my youth,
we used to stay out all night.

552
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:19,100
We used to go see the big bands.

553
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,300
But the only thing I ever
heard of were reefers.

554
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,700
And that's what the musicians
were supposed to smoke.

555
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,700
I have been at parties
and they were all...toke,

556
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,200
having a toke.

557
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,767
Ha. I think I'm saying it right.

558
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:40,734
And then they'd pass it around,
and you're supposed to smoke it.

559
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:44,734
WOMAN: I was lucky to have had
the experience of...

560
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:46,567
of staying at the Ford's house.

561
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,934
It definitely felt like being
in a dormitory.

562
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:51,834
I think anyone under 18
was sort of welcome.

563
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,133
Not anyone.
That's not true.

564
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,400
There was a few rooms.

565
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,667
And I think if you were working,

566
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,967
and the more you were working,
the more...

567
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:01,367
the more vacancy...ha ha...
there was there.

568
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:04,467
I forget how many models
lived with us.

569
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,800
They had to live by my rules.

570
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,900
It was like having
a bunch more children.

571
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,367
I've probably had more doors
slammed in my face

572
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:14,433
than any woman
you're ever gonna meet.

573
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,867
I knew where the wine was kept.

574
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:19,567
I left pajamas downstairs
in the kitchen

575
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:22,433
so when I'd come in late,
I could change into my clothes.

576
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:26,500
Jerry Hall has been quoted
about me,

577
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,100
saying it was the most
boring year of her entire life.

578
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,633
JERRY HALL:
They had a curfew.

579
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:36,333
You had to be in the house
by a certain time.

580
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:39,734
And every weekend, we had
to go in her station wagon

581
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:42,834
with her kids and her dog
out to Connecticut.

582
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:47,300
And then, you had to come when
she had these boring dinners
and things.

583
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,700
It was very difficult
having been so free in Paris.

584
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,600
Going out dancing
and dancing on the tables.

585
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
And going out with...

586
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,934
We had a lot of friends
who were transvestites.

587
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:02,367
And they were great fun.

588
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:05,900
And I got a lot of makeup tips
from them. Ha ha!

589
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,934
And having gone out every night
and had so much fun

590
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:13,066
and met all these wonderful
people to all of a sudden be...

591
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:15,533
you have to be in by midnight.

592
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:20,367
I quickly got out of Eileen's
because I couldn't go out.

593
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:21,600
Ha ha!

594
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,467
I couldn't wait to get away
from home.

595
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,200
Just couldn't wait.

596
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,433
My grandmother, she did not want
me doing this at all.

597
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:31,667
She never spoke to
Diana Vreeland again.

598
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,467
She...ha ha...was furious.

599
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,000
And she never spoke to me
about it

600
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,500
except to criticize the way I...
I went out dressed.

601
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,333
She thought it was the most
un-chic, dreadfully vulgar,

602
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:46,767
"How can you go out on
the street looking like this?"

603
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:48,767
One day, she handed me
this dress.

604
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:52,533
It was like an old curtain
found in some trunk
in some old castle,

605
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,500
like, you know?

606
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,467
She said, "I want you to
put this on and come to tea

607
00:33:56,467 --> 00:34:00,467
"because I have this gentleman
you have to meet.

608
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:03,400
Because I think
you should get married."

609
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,700
But I wanted
that wonderful adventure.

610
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,700
We lived the greatest adventure
of all in those days.

611
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,300
I was a liberated woman.

612
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,667
I had the pill.
I had the clothes.

613
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:15,834
I had the place to go.

614
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,633
We didn't know who we were with.

615
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:20,400
The girls with the boys,
and the boys with the boys.

616
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,500
Just fall in love with the
best-looking thing you can find.

617
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,934
And in the model business,

618
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:26,700
there's a lot
of good-looking people.

619
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,800
Powder was flying and the flames
were coming from the sky

620
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,533
and hell was breaking loose.

621
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:35,300
We weren't afraid of anything.

622
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,834
We were just so free.

623
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:42,400
And we just did everything
and wanted to taste everything
and do everything.

624
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,133
I mean, I was 16,

625
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,233
and I was brought up
in boarding schools.

626
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:49,500
How did I live by myself in New
York and just live like that?

627
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,934
Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol...
all these amazing people.

628
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:58,667
It wasn't just about
selling the clothes
and making a lot of money.

629
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,300
It wasn't.

630
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,700
It was about making a whole
world that you would enter into.

631
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,667
There was a lot of love
and friendship,

632
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:09,500
doing things together
and creating

633
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,100
and being part of
that same world together,
on that wave together.

634
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,000
People got lost in that.

635
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,800
We were just overwhelmed
with ourselves.

636
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,400
We were so arrogant.

637
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,433
Our clothes were, like,
getting heavier and stronger.

638
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:30,967
I've lost a lot of friends in my
life, a lot of great people,

639
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:33,166
either from drugs or from AIDS.

640
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:37,900
It was like a fire that just
went straight through the heart
of the business.

641
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,700
For the longest time,
your main concern was,

642
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,967
"Is my friend this thin because
they're smoking too much
or partying too much

643
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,400
or because they have AIDS?"

644
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,066
I started seeing everyone
dressed in black.

645
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,433
And they just started
disappearing.

646
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:58,700
And I knew it was the end
of the time.

647
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,800
[Applause]

648
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,967
I love to see people dancing.

649
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:06,066
It's so romantic and such fun.

650
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:12,133
This extravagant white satin
organza dress on Karen Bjornson
is just for that occasion.

651
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:15,133
Nothing is prettier
than a dress that moves.

652
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:18,633
WOMAN: I was 18 when
I started working for Halston.

653
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:23,233
He was like a prince.
Everyone was in love.

654
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:26,100
He was always looking out
for me.

655
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,800
I was so young
and impressionable

656
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:36,233
and he was so kind...
and funny and loving.

657
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:40,367
Never talked about Halston
at all.

658
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:44,800
It was amazing to be around
that creativity,

659
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,166
to be in the room with him,
with him designing and
cutting the clothes on me.

660
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,667
WOMAN: I knew she
had been a model,

661
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,233
but I didn't really
think of her.

662
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:55,567
She was Mom.

663
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,600
But then when she
started modeling again,

664
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,934
it was like, "Oh, my God.
She's Karen Bjornson."

665
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:03,066
I actually got to do
a show with her

666
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:05,033
during senior year
of high school.

667
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:08,934
And I wrote about it
for my college
admissions essay.

668
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:11,333
So, she's the reason
that I ended up

669
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,633
going to Harvard
for college, I think.

670
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:17,500
I didn't go to college.
So I felt that was...

671
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,000
Important.

672
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,667
Important.
It was a la...

673
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,567
I felt a lack with that.

674
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,800
And I wanted them
to have that.

675
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,433
Aw...

676
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:30,467
This is my "Cosmo" cover,
April 1972.

677
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:35,934
And it became
a very famous issue because...

678
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:38,100
[Laughter]

679
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,867
I retired for 13 years.

680
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,433
We moved to Connecticut in 1989.

681
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:50,166
I would dream about being
a model and modeling and...

682
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:54,667
and working with Halston and
hearing his voice calling me
to go out on the runway.

683
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,400
Those are the good dreams.

684
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,433
The dreams where you're
flying are the dreams
where I was working.

685
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:07,200
Then, when I was 50,
Ralph Rucci called
and asked me to do his show.

686
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,400
I was looking at the photos from
it, and the eyes bothered me.

687
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,333
Things are changing.

688
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,500
Go in the mirror and you push
and think, "Hmmm."

689
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,934
I did my eyes.

690
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:23,734
Money well spent, definitely.

691
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,266
Getting the product
in shape again.

692
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:29,233
I don't want to look younger.

693
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:32,900
I just wanna look well rested.

694
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,233
And then, you just say, "This is
as good as it gets today."

695
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:40,834
That's what I usually do
if I'm going on...a casting.

696
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,233
This is it.

697
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:45,033
I'm 58. I'm...I'm...

698
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm a happy 58-year-old woman.

699
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,700
MACHADO: I was never one
to do plastic surgery.

700
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,333
First of all, I'm a coward.

701
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,700
I didn't go to the dentist
for 10 years.

702
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,133
So you can imagine.

703
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:01,867
Every time I go there,
I practically run him
out of the chair

704
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:03,500
before he gets me down
on the chair, ok?

705
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,266
So just the idea that they were
gonna do something to me.

706
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,867
But, of course, if it got
desperate, I would.

707
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:11,800
But now, it's past that time.

708
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,033
I don't buy creams.

709
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:17,834
I don't go to the facials.

710
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:19,400
I don't go to beauty parlors.

711
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,100
I wash my own hair.

712
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,400
My husband would have to
drive me there and pick me up.

713
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,000
That's already out, ok?

714
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:30,867
I mean, now that
I'm suddenly being
photographed at the age of 81,

715
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,633
I'm not that happy.

716
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,166
Right. You're
holding this...

717
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,467
Take off the...

718
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:37,000
Right. How the hell
did you do that?

719
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,200
I don't know.

720
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,667
[Laughter]

721
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,033
That's '58,
for Christ sakes.
Do you think I remember?

722
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:45,033
I wish he had photographed me
50 years ago.

723
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:47,233
It would have been easier.

724
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:51,300
It isn't that women
want to stay young.

725
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,433
It's that the whole society
makes us want to stay young.

726
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,100
Nothing to do with us.

727
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,266
I mean, you keep thinking
you're gonna be judged.

728
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,967
Most important thing you have

729
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,166
that'll make you look different
from someone else

730
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,033
is your expression.

731
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,667
So if you change that,
your whole look goes.

732
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:14,633
You could be, maybe,
better looking.

733
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:16,000
You might be more perfect.

734
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,700
You could...
you could fill out my cheeks,

735
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,767
and then, you know,
but you take out the lines.

736
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:22,133
But then there's nothing left
of you.

737
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:27,467
You know, sometime I'm surprised
that I look at images of my mom
when she was in her 30s,

738
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,900
and you wouldn't think she's 30s
because women in...

739
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,133
in 1940, 1950 seem to me
they wanted to look ladylike.

740
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:41,767
An image of a mature woman,
that it is appealing,

741
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:45,734
that it is sophisticated, it is
elegant, and that we aim at.

742
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:50,600
The modeling career is really
something that sort of brings
out your insecurities.

743
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,467
I mean, I remember girls who
were coming in, 25 years old,

744
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:56,734
and were worried about
their looks because there was
a 15-year-old girl next to her.

745
00:40:56,734 --> 00:41:01,533
Until that time, well,
look at the model Dovima,

746
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:06,333
who was this absolute
fascinating natural beauty.

747
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:14,133
But she was a woman.

748
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,467
[Whistling]

749
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,333
You wanna know what comes
between me and my Calvin's?

750
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,367
Nothing,

751
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:48,533
I remember distinctly
in the "Daily News" that day,

752
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:52,800
on the front page, after
we ran the first commercials,

753
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,100
the Dow Jones broke 1,000.

754
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,934
And they put it
in the upper right-hand corner,

755
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:02,967
"Dow Jones breaks 1,000,"
which was a really big deal.

756
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:05,834
Gigantic picture
of Brooke Shields

757
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:10,667
in a charmeuse shirt
and the jeans.

758
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:13,767
Calvin Klein thrown off the air.

759
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:19,433
Someone came up to me one night
at 4:00 in the morning
at Studio 54

760
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:23,633
and asked me if I'd be
interested in doing jeans,
blue jeans.

761
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:27,700
After creating the...the...
the collection of jeans,

762
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:33,433
we decided that
we should be on TV.

763
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:36,367
Because to really reach America,

764
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:39,367
the way to do it
is through television.

765
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:42,433
I went to see Dick Avedon.

766
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:47,433
And we started to spend
every night together,
and crazy nights.

767
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,834
And with Doon Arbus.

768
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:53,500
And we just...
We would talk and talk.

769
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,066
And then Doon would be writing.

770
00:42:57,066 --> 00:43:03,467
When we would read what Doon
was writing, we laughed.

771
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:09,867
Reading is to the mind
what Calvin's are to the body.

772
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:11,567
We thought that was so funny.

773
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:14,400
And provocative and interesting.

774
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,266
I mean,
I didn't ever think that...

775
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:20,800
that it would create such
a stir.

776
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,734
All I wanted to do
was sell product

777
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:26,934
and create something that
was exciting and interesting,
great to look at.

778
00:43:26,934 --> 00:43:30,233
I wasn't interested
in influencing anyone else.

779
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,500
And we sold a lot of product.

780
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,367
ROSSELLINI:
When I reached my 40s,

781
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,200
Lancôme felt they needed
to substitute me,

782
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,400
in spite of the fact that
all the marketing research

783
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,600
proved that
I was very successful,

784
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,900
that people loved that
I was actually reaching 40
and doing anti-age cream,

785
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,100
that they loved
the familiarity of a face.

786
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,767
And they could follow my aging.

787
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:03,066
But the voice that won over,

788
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:07,900
and so I was asked to leave,
was the voice that women
dream to be younger.

789
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,867
And advertisement
is about dreams.

790
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:12,633
It's not about reality.

791
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:14,467
And I don't know
that that is true.

792
00:44:14,467 --> 00:44:17,066
See, I am an old fox.

793
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:19,633
And I say, "I'll buy that cream
'cause I know that works.

794
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:21,734
"I buy that eye shadow
because I tried many

795
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:24,133
"and I know there is 5
that work.

796
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:25,667
Or this lipstick."

797
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,066
It's harder to sell to me.

798
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:29,133
But it's easier to sell
to my daughter.

799
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:34,133
So I think advertisement talk to
the young people, not to the
dream of women to be young.

800
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,033
But it has also the
bad consequences

801
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:41,300
of creating an industry
that perpetuates this idea
that women sh...

802
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,400
to be beautiful,
should be young and thin.

803
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,734
CAROL ALT: My "Playboy" stuff
made people angry.

804
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:52,166
MAN: The "Playboy" stuff
you did at 47?

805
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:55,900
48. Ha ha!
48, baby.

806
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,200
They asked me to do 50.
You know what?

807
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,066
My point was trying
to teach women

808
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:04,233
that you can be healthy
and happy.

809
00:45:04,233 --> 00:45:07,633
You know, for a girl
who said to her dad,

810
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:10,000
"I promise I won't do
underwear."

811
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,934
This was my favorite photo.
This was my favorite shot.

812
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:16,233
I didn't like this one so much.

813
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:18,000
I just thought it was
too out there, in your face.

814
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,533
My mother said to me,
"Oh, Carol,

815
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:22,367
I see more in the museum,
for heaven sakes."

816
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:25,433
I'll be 50 in two weeks.

817
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:27,567
At first,
when you're 17, 18, 19...

818
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:32,400
even till 25, you can starve
yourself and lose the weight

819
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,633
and still maintain energy

820
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:35,633
because you're living
on the body's reserves.

821
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:38,100
One day, I was shooting, and I
was watching this other girl.

822
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,500
And I was the name
on the project,

823
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,667
but she captivated the set.

824
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:43,767
I was curious.

825
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:46,567
Like, what happened from 23
that she was

826
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:52,867
to the 33 that I was
that I went from that to this?

827
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:54,967
CARMEN DELL'ORIFICE:
When I was 37,

828
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:58,433
I was brought in by a girlfriend
to a doctor who said,

829
00:45:58,433 --> 00:46:01,800
"Carmen, you have ruined,
ruined your skin."

830
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,467
Which I had.

831
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:07,100
He said,
"I'm gonna plane your face.

832
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,767
This is not a peel.
It's not acid.

833
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,834
It's like the dentist,
you know, when you have
your teeth cleaned."

834
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:16,967
And he took my face off.

835
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:18,734
Hello, don't give me
an argument.

836
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,767
Why don't I do this?
Why don't I go...

837
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:23,000
Why don't you wrestle
in a Botox...

838
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,800
All the new stuff.
No, I've had...

839
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,266
You're looking at all those
years of silicone injections
by one doctor.

840
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:32,266
Beth Ann Hartson is a tomboy.

841
00:46:32,266 --> 00:46:33,633
Am I gonna do anything
to myself?

842
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:35,133
I'm gonna try
and get this ass down.

843
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:38,834
And that'll be doing planks
in the morning.

844
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:43,633
Tighten. Release.
Tighten. Ha ha!

845
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:48,100
That idea of having a nose
that's the same nose
somebody else has,

846
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,200
I can't imagine wanting that.

847
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,800
I admire many other women
and think,

848
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,934
"Oh, wow, she has beautiful
eyes or beautiful hair
or beautiful skin."

849
00:46:56,934 --> 00:46:59,967
But it doesn't mean
that I want those things.

850
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,200
When you live in a culture
like we do in America

851
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,033
that's just going crazy with,
you know, paparazzi's
everywhere.

852
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:07,734
And what are they looking for?

853
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:10,700
They're looking for that little
bit of cellulite peeking out
from your skirt.

854
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,033
Collectively, it brings us down.

855
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:16,233
If I thought I'd advertise it,
I'd get a facelift.

856
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,667
Why shouldn't you?

857
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:21,200
Why, if...if you feel better
about yourself,

858
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,000
that's the most important thing
about living.

859
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,333
You have to like who you are.

860
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:30,567
I think Botox and whatever...
Look.

861
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:34,000
I think it's bad that we have,
as role models,

862
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,500
people who look scary
to small children.

863
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,000
They're cutting up their faces.

864
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,667
They're doing
all these strange things.

865
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:45,734
Their ears have gone weird.

866
00:47:45,734 --> 00:47:48,834
They take fat from their bottom
and they stick it in their lip.

867
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:51,633
So when you kiss them,
you're kissing their bottom.

868
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:53,033
That is so disgusting.

869
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:56,166
Every garbage bag needs
to be changed.

870
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,834
The face is a tool.

871
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,567
You know, you can use it
in one way or another.

872
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:03,233
And I've always used my face
sort of like a mask, you know?

873
00:48:03,233 --> 00:48:05,500
I like moving it around and...

874
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,567
I think I'm going
for the draping.

875
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:09,767
Hoo, voila.

876
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:12,500
I am debating in my head.

877
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,767
One day, I get up, and I say,
"Hey, there's this
new technology.

878
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,400
Why not use it?
Let's go do the operation."

879
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,533
But most of time,
I wake up saying,
"Is this the new feet binding?

880
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,400
"Is this a new way of
being misogynist?

881
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,467
"Is this a new way to tell women
you are ugly?

882
00:48:28,467 --> 00:48:31,066
Deep down, you should be this
and this and this."

883
00:48:31,066 --> 00:48:33,033
And you give a lot of...

884
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:36,467
other standards that are
impossible to be reached

885
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:40,834
because the laying problem
is misogyny.

886
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,166
In your 20s,
you want to have children.

887
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,967
You're looking for a mate.

888
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,900
Need to attract a certain thing.

889
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,367
It's funny. I have skin
like my grandma.

890
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:51,900
It, like, turns splotchy
in the sun.

891
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,533
I think it gets worse with age,
too.

892
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:57,834
So, oh, yeah, something
really nice to look forward to.

893
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,834
At 50, you don't need
to attract the same thing,

894
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:03,000
so why do you need to look like
you still want to attract
the same thing?

895
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,200
I'm 45, and I do not need to
attract fertile men anymore.

896
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,700
I'm not really interested.

897
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,734
I've got my kids, got my man.

898
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:15,100
I'm interested in attracting
different things now.

899
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,867
You know, I watch women my age,
my peers,

900
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:21,800
and I see how they're getting,
you know,

901
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,133
20 years younger-looking than I.

902
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,867
And it's not that I don't go,

903
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:31,734
"Hmm, I'm kind of being
left in the dust here
with my moving forehead

904
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:35,300
and my strangely elastic face."

905
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:41,100
To me, the most beautiful thing
there is in another human
is confidence.

906
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:48,333
And nothing says "I'm not
confident" as much as Botox.

907
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:53,667
MAN: But it's like
you have a contract
with a higher being.

908
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:55,100
Ha!

909
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:59,900
I mean, I know you
haven't had anything done.

910
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,066
No, not yet.

911
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:04,000
Not...Well, you don't...
you look...

912
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,533
You look amaz...
You look amazing.

913
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:10,300
Absolutely amazing.

914
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,033
How can you tell?

915
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:14,667
By just looking at you.
You can tell as
a hairdresser, right?

916
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,934
You know, like...

917
00:50:15,934 --> 00:50:17,467
No, it's like...
I won't mention names,

918
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:22,333
but I worked once with
a major, major, major,
mega, mega, mega movie star.

919
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:26,200
And she was always saying
how she never, ever had
anything done.

920
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,533
Right.

921
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:28,734
And I saw the scars.

922
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,000
Right.

923
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,700
And she was very nervous
about me even going near her.

924
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,000
Right.

925
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,166
And she was on television
that night being interviewed.

926
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:41,000
And the interviewer said,
"You look so amazing.

927
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,767
Have you had anything done?"

928
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:46,533
And she said, "No. I..."

929
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:48,700
Well, I guess as long
as you look amazing,

930
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,433
you can pretend
that you haven't.

931
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:53,400
When I very first started
in the business,

932
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,867
models were still
clothes hangers.

933
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:04,500
And over the years, the industry
has allowed models to put a name
to the face.

934
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,900
Once people put your name
to the face,

935
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,867
business opportunities open up
and branding opportunities.

936
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:14,133
I need a thing.

937
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:15,667
Hey, sailor.

938
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:17,166
[Laughter]

939
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,800
I would say,
for the past 25 years,

940
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,867
they've been referring to me
as former supermodel
or former model.

941
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:27,433
But it just keeps
on chugging along.

942
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:36,367
Great.
That looks good.

943
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:38,166
That's perfect. Perfect.

944
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:43,433
WOMAN: You know, we've
got another long skirt
in white, too.

945
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,533
This Chloe one.

946
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:45,734
They don't have
a long one.

947
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah, we do,
don't we?

948
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:56,166
Unbelievable.
This is...

949
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:02,066
WOMAN: My sons, when they went
to college, they said,

950
00:52:02,066 --> 00:52:04,867
"Mom, thank you so much
for never doing nude pictures."

951
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:07,367
Now, 30 years ago,
we didn't have Google.

952
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:11,266
And so, who would know,
when you're in a little
studio by yourself,

953
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:14,900
that 30 years later, somebody
could Google you and boom.

954
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,800
All the whole,
you know, lacrosse team

955
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,433
from my son could find my son's,
you know, mother.

956
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:27,433
For me, it was a walk
with growing up and maturing.

957
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:33,834
I went from innocent not knowing
anything to thinking that I was
better than other people.

958
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,734
Then I realized
I'm not happy that way.

959
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm happy going home early
and working out

960
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,834
and just being a mother
and being a wife.

961
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:44,333
And you know,
what made Kim happy was...

962
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,900
was more family.

963
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,700
We have that
breakdown.

964
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,300
[Chatter]

965
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,066
We have
all that stuff.

966
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:55,333
Yeah, we do.
Don't we?

967
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:59,600
I'm good with A lines.
I'm good with...

968
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,967
All right.
Hold on.

969
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,266
WOMAN: Being smaller
than everybody and dark
and curly haired,

970
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:11,333
not really the look
of the times,

971
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:14,300
I had to work much, much harder

972
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:19,300
to make myself able
to participate in a shot.

973
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:25,033
I felt that there were many
girls way more beautiful
than I was.

974
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:33,333
But I did feel I was bringing
more to what I was doing than
just what I looked like.

975
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:38,033
For me, it was that,
through a picture,

976
00:53:38,033 --> 00:53:41,100
I could communicate, or felt
like I could communicate.

977
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,400
That's where beauty lies, is how
do you come up with a smile?

978
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,900
How do you find it without being
superficial?

979
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,600
And how do you translate your
experiences, good and bad,

980
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,867
into something that's meaningful
to yourself and to others?

981
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,900
We're gonna set
the seamless.

982
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:14,467
We don't have the same 12-footer
that we had in New York.

983
00:54:14,467 --> 00:54:16,467
Take this out of...
take it out.

984
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:23,967
[Chatter]

985
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:28,834
Oh, my god.
Ha ha ha.

986
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,567
There she is.

987
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,700
So why don't you hire a model
who's got long legs?

988
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,200
Ha ha!

989
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,133
I don't know if I would
become a top model today

990
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:41,567
because the looks are so...
glamorous and exotic.

991
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:46,867
Well, I think that people saw
a sweetness that they liked.

992
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,000
For a long time,
people didn't know my name.

993
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,734
But I was this person that they
felt very close to, which was
always very interesting to me.

994
00:54:54,734 --> 00:54:56,333
Because sometimes
I would sit in a salon,

995
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,633
and I would hear the people say
to one another,

996
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:00,800
"Have a good time
at the birthday party tonight.

997
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,767
And say hi to your grandma."

998
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,700
And I thought, you know, they
have this little community.

999
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:10,367
They have this little, you know,
family that they go to
every day

1000
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:13,333
and friendships,
which I never had.

1001
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:18,800
And then, "Cover Girl," "Sports
Illustrated," and "Time"
magazine used my name.

1002
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,367
And then, it got to be
so I'd walk down the street

1003
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:23,100
and people would say,
"Hi, Cheryl."

1004
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,934
And that was a good feeling
because...

1005
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:27,834
I felt, well,
I have a lot of friends.

1006
00:55:27,834 --> 00:55:30,333
You know, and if anything ever
happened to me,

1007
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,066
I fainted in an airport
or whatever,

1008
00:55:32,066 --> 00:55:35,333
I would know that there would be
a lot of people there.

1009
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,533
When I finished
my college education,

1010
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:42,533
my agent said to me,
"Cheryl, you finished
your formal education.

1011
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:44,800
"But the key to beauty,
and I've always believed this,

1012
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,533
"is always educating yourself,
always learning something new,
always doing something new.

1013
00:55:50,533 --> 00:55:52,033
Have something to talk about."

1014
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:53,667
And I never forgot that.

1015
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:58,834
And I think that that's
how one ages beautifully.

1016
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,367
Wedding plans.
My daughter.

1017
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,166
Getting married.

1018
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,133
Long neck and shoulders,
back and down.

1019
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:17,333
And relax my mouth. Ok.
Thank you, sweetheart.

1020
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,667
I love you.

1021
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:21,033
I just want to just
cut a bit off here,

1022
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:22,633
bit off here,
open you up.

1023
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:24,333
Yes.
Too heavy in...

1024
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:25,734
Too heavy, yes.

1025
00:56:25,734 --> 00:56:29,533
And just
open it up and...

1026
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:31,467
Gosh.
Thank you.

1027
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:34,166
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

1028
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:41,233
You were my last
"Vogue" cover.

1029
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:43,400
MAN: What year was that?

1030
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,700
About 1845.

1031
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,333
[Laughter]

1032
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:50,700
JOHNSON: I just don't think
discrimination can be a trend.

1033
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,667
In the stadium at Fashion Week,
every culture is there.

1034
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:58,266
But particularly, a lot of
people of color are there.

1035
00:56:58,266 --> 00:57:06,600
And here on the runway
are just all white models,
very clone-like.

1036
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,967
And here we are peering
into this sacred world.

1037
00:57:11,967 --> 00:57:15,533
I didn't like that
one freakin' bit.

1038
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:19,567
A designer would call me
and say, "Ok, I gotta
talk to you.

1039
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:21,834
You gotta find me
a great black girl."

1040
00:57:21,834 --> 00:57:25,000
I said, "Ok, sounds good.
How many girls are you using?"

1041
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,767
"36."

1042
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:31,166
"And you want me to find you
one great black girl?"

1043
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:32,934
They said, "Yes."

1044
00:57:32,934 --> 00:57:35,834
And I said, "Now, don't you see
there's a problem with that
right there?"

1045
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:38,133
And no one wants to think
themselves as a racist.

1046
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:41,767
But no matter how much they say,
"Oh, it's not my aesthetic.

1047
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:43,567
It's just not my aesthetic."

1048
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:46,867
The word aesthetic is borderline
racist at this point.

1049
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:52,100
In 1958, I came here
in September, and I was
photographed by Avedon.

1050
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,834
"Harper's Bazaar" did not want
to publish the photographs

1051
00:57:54,834 --> 00:57:57,367
because I was the first
non-Caucasian.

1052
00:57:57,367 --> 00:58:00,967
They said, "Everybody
in the South is gonna drop
their subscriptions."

1053
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:04,934
And Dick said,
"I'm not gonna renew my contract

1054
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:07,633
unless you publish
these pictures."

1055
00:58:07,633 --> 00:58:11,900
But Dick also told me,
"Your career will be
very restricted

1056
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,300
because you're
too exotic looking.

1057
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,033
You're not gonna be used
in catalogues.

1058
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:18,633
You're gonna have a few ads,"
which I did have.

1059
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:20,266
"And you're gonna do editorial."

1060
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:23,300
But he said, "You know,
that's not enough for you.

1061
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,066
You should do more."

1062
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:30,200
I became senior fashion editor
in "Harper's Bazaar" in 1962.

1063
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,734
Can you imagine?
It was only 3 years before

1064
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:35,600
that they didn't even want me
published in the magazine?

1065
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,133
I was a TV producer.
I had my own store.

1066
00:58:41,133 --> 00:58:43,867
I sat at another magazine
called "Leers"

1067
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:48,967
for the woman who was over 45.

1068
00:58:48,967 --> 00:58:50,834
I brought up two children.

1069
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:54,433
No one ever gave me $20.

1070
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,367
How would I sum up my life?

1071
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,633
I'm a survivor.

1072
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,467
WOMAN: While I'm
late for a plane.
I'm like...

1073
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,033
I had no idea that
he was that type of guy.

1074
00:59:16,033 --> 00:59:17,734
WOMAN:
Oh, you did not?

1075
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,633
Oh, he loved the tomboy.

1076
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,600
Oh, he loved angst.

1077
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,667
This was really a departure
for me.

1078
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,066
It really was just about
making some money

1079
00:59:33,066 --> 00:59:34,367
to help my father
pay for my education.

1080
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:36,600
It was never, like,
"Oh, I think I'm so gorgeous."

1081
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,066
When that first editor in John
Stember's studio said to me,

1082
00:59:40,066 --> 00:59:42,233
"You're too big for our clothes.
Your hair looks like shit.

1083
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,066
And who the hell
plucks your eyebrows?"

1084
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:45,500
Well, I was too big
for their clothes.

1085
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,934
And my hair did look like shit.

1086
00:59:46,934 --> 00:59:48,500
And who the hell
plucked my eyebrows? I did.

1087
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,567
So, it didn't hurt me.

1088
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:52,667
Like, I don't care.
I knew who I was.

1089
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,300
I knew where I was going.

1090
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,166
I mean, after that,
it changed a little bit,

1091
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:58,000
but I always still knew
who I was.

1092
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,200
I'm a fireman's daughter
from Long Island.

1093
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,767
And it'll never change, ever.

1094
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:06,734
If this the way
to cut hair?

1095
01:00:06,734 --> 01:00:08,967
Oh, it's how
I do it.

1096
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:15,734
Now my 8-year-old is gonna look
at me and go, "Who are you?"

1097
01:00:15,734 --> 01:00:17,633
Ha ha!

1098
01:00:23,834 --> 01:00:29,133
TAYLOR: I did get self esteem
from succeeding in something.

1099
01:00:29,133 --> 01:00:32,900
It was not an easy thing to do,
and I succeeded.

1100
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,400
That gives me real,
true core confidence.

1101
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,533
Good,
stay like that.

1102
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:42,400
I don't regret anything.

1103
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,500
I see that it could have
gone a different way,

1104
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,066
and I still don't regret
anything.

1105
01:00:47,066 --> 01:00:49,533
I did what I had to do.

1106
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:51,133
Where I am right now
is where I need to be.

1107
01:00:51,133 --> 01:00:56,000
And I'm just really glad
I didn't die in the process.

1108
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:12,200
MAN:
Yeah, right there.

1109
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,500
Good.

1110
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,467
WOMAN:
Am I covering the boob?
Yeah, you're good.

1111
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:18,934
Right, stay like that.
Very simple changing.

1112
01:01:18,934 --> 01:01:21,567
Not very much.
Gorgeous.

1113
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,467
All right, we got...
Oh, sorry. We got to catch up.

1114
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:54,934
[Laughter]

1115
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:59,667
Thank God for fashion
'cause where would I be now?

1116
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:03,000
I was just praying,
"God, please give me
something that I can do."

1117
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,600
In the '50s, you know, how as...
with women

1118
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,800
and the physique
and the kind of beauty.

1119
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,767
And I was absolutely
not beautiful.

1120
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:15,433
And fashion gave me feathers,

1121
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:17,834
'cause I could fit
into the clothes.

1122
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,467
And that made me feel sexy
and beautiful,

1123
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:22,900
just like the girls
who were well endowed.

1124
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:30,433
I was staying in Rome with
Danielle Luna, and were decided
to go see Josephine Baker.

1125
01:02:30,433 --> 01:02:32,700
She loved us.

1126
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,066
She...She told us how important
we were to her.

1127
01:02:37,066 --> 01:02:41,333
She said, "Well, my girls, I
have faith that everything I did

1128
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:44,467
was worthwhile
because I see you here."

1129
01:02:46,633 --> 01:02:49,500
PORIZKOVA:
I don't really know
when it happened

1130
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:55,300
where one day I thought, "I
deserve to be called beautiful."

1131
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,700
That thought probably
didn't even come to me
until about two years ago

1132
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,000
when I looked at old pictures
of myself and thought,
"Damn, I was good looking.

1133
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,667
What was wrong with me
back then?"

1134
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:04,266
Ok, now this is...

1135
01:03:04,266 --> 01:03:05,734
Ha ha!

1136
01:03:05,734 --> 01:03:06,967
Oh, my.

1137
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:08,233
Now, this is what
I want you to...

1138
01:03:08,233 --> 01:03:09,867
It's Morticia.

1139
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:11,633
PORIZKOVA:
I look at pictures of myself

1140
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:14,600
back when, you know, I was 24
or whatever,

1141
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:19,200
and I thought I had fat thighs
and ugly legs and puffy legs and
neh, neh, neh, neh, neh.

1142
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,100
And I look at my body now,
I'm like, "I should've been
naked all the time."

1143
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:27,467
'Cause now, I go to the gym,
like, 6 times a week and,
Mmmm, no.

1144
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:30,033
But I know that
by the time I'm 75,

1145
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:32,433
I'm gonna go,
"What was I talking about?

1146
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:35,500
For a 40...
I mean, looked...I looked great.

1147
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,000
Feeling beautiful is
being self confident.

1148
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,767
And modeling doesn't
have anything to do
with self confidence.

1149
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:44,133
Working off of your looks
makes you pretty...

1150
01:03:44,133 --> 01:03:47,166
makes you pretty much the
opposite of self confident.

1151
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:52,133
So maybe I became beautiful
once I stopped modeling.

1152
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:56,200
ROSSELLINI:
For sure, my social stature
has diminished

1153
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,333
because I know I'm not invited
to the "A" parties anymore.

1154
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:04,533
Ha ha! My daughter is.

1155
01:04:04,533 --> 01:04:08,133
What is completely disappeared
from society is the wisdom of
the old people.

1156
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:09,367
Ha ha!

1157
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:12,734
As you grow old,
you don't count anymore.

1158
01:04:12,734 --> 01:04:17,266
So that is, I think, the
greatest fear about growing old.

1159
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:21,400
And until a few years ago,
as you grew older, your
social status grew.

1160
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,467
You were a person of experience.
You were a person of wisdom.

1161
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:27,700
You were a person that
lived throughout the crisis

1162
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:31,567
and would be able
to help handle it.

1163
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,734
I remember my ma,
she told me once

1164
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:37,633
that growing old,
well, that's the only way
to have a long life.

1165
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:38,967
And I'd rather have that.

1166
01:04:38,967 --> 01:04:41,834
She didn't seem to be
very affected by old age.

1167
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:47,834
And that might have been also
another reason why I don't feel
that affected by it either.

1168
01:04:47,834 --> 01:04:51,400
Of course it's no fun getting
old and sick and dying.

1169
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,100
We all know that's coming,
and it's a bore.

1170
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,300
But people are living longer.

1171
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,967
They're healthier longer.

1172
01:04:57,967 --> 01:05:01,100
They have sex longer.

1173
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,934
Why shouldn't we be allowed
to age?

1174
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:06,567
And why shouldn't we be
respected for it?

1175
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:10,467
When I turned 50,
I felt a sense of achievement.

1176
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:13,467
I've lived 50 years.
I've made it.

1177
01:05:13,467 --> 01:05:15,967
I think there's something
to be said for that

1178
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:17,734
and to be celebrated.

1179
01:05:17,734 --> 01:05:22,166
And the other thing about
getting older is you can be
a little more eccentric,

1180
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:23,300
you know?

1181
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,800
People let you.
Sleep late.

1182
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,633
Go around in your lingerie.

1183
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:33,533
Ha ha ha!

1184
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:36,800
BERENSON:
Women have to be everything.

1185
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,900
Mothers, lovers, wives,
business women.

1186
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,967
They have to know how to do
everything today.

1187
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:46,400
It wasn't like that
in our day so much.

1188
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,667
You know, we just flew through
those periods just completely...

1189
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,867
I look back at that time.

1190
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:58,300
If I had been maybe
a more business minded,
like women are today,

1191
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:03,567
at the peak of my career,
I basically gave it up and
got married and had a child.

1192
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:08,200
I don't think regret is a good
thing because you can't do
anything about it.

1193
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,900
So it's a useless emotion.

1194
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,000
If I hadn't done it that way,
I would never have
had my daughter,

1195
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,467
I wouldn't have had
the learning experience
of all of the ups and downs.

1196
01:06:21,467 --> 01:06:25,800
The most important part
of my life is to

1197
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,633
feel like an asset
to the world at least
in some small way.

1198
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:37,200
I mean, we're only
little, tiny creatures here
and then we go elsewhere.

1199
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,000
While one's passing
on this planet, you know,

1200
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:47,066
to at least leave a little ray
of light, I think, is important.

1201
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:57,533
I guess I began to feel I was ok
when somebody I really loved

1202
01:06:57,533 --> 01:06:59,900
kissed me.

1203
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,333
It's not so much what
I'm seeing in the mirror

1204
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:07,600
but what I'm, you know, feeling
in a connection with somebody

1205
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,567
I want to feel close to.

1206
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:17,633
The society has
decided the age 50 to 100
is not sexually viable.

1207
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:22,300
But someday the models of today
are gonna be my age.

1208
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:27,667
I think my career
has lasted so long,

1209
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:30,166
which is now 65 years,

1210
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:34,100
because I'm not doing this thing
in front of the camera

1211
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,900
to get love and be approved of.

1212
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:42,233
I get my love privately.

1213
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:48,600
When I go into a casting, which
I do as little as possible,

1214
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,166
'cause if they don't know
who I am by now, forget it.

1215
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:54,367
And they say,
"Oh, you're too tall.

1216
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:56,967
Or you're not this,"
or whatever, I just leave.

1217
01:07:56,967 --> 01:07:58,633
It's as simple as that.

1218
01:07:58,633 --> 01:08:04,100
There's another job
or there isn't another job.

1219
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,400
We all have to go sometime.

1220
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,133
And when I go, I wanna go
with my high heels on.

1221
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:15,066
Ha ha!
