Wanna have a little fun?

00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:26,033
- Who's this?
- Tell me your name
and I'll tell you mine.

6
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:28,075
I don't think so. [Farts]

7
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:31,117
- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,450
- I didn't think
you would hear me.
- No, that popping noise.

9
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:38,283
Oh. I'm making popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.

- Do you like scary movies?
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:47,492
- What's your favorite?
- Mm, I don't know.

Think.

14
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:53,117
Oh, I know. Um, Kazaam,
the one where Shaq plays a genie.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,575
- That's not a horror movie.
- Well, you haven't seen Shaq act.

- Thanks.

18
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:03,783
You never did tell me your name.

19
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:06,117
Why do you wanna know my name?

20
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:08,908
Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

Listen, asshole, you've had your fun,
now you better stop or else.

- Or else my boyfriends

00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:58,492
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.

check the back door first.

It just occurred to me. I never
climbed through your window before.

58
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:05,450
Now that you got it out of your system,
Bobby, you have to leave.

- No. No, you didn't, Dad.

Well, it could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

some legs are gonna get broken.

It's just better if I lay low
for a couple of days.

- If the cops raid the place--
- I never heard of you.

- And don't forget--
- To flush your stash.

Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

76
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:51,825
that I left you a little something
in the coffee can.

- But you have to remember to step
on it before you sell it.

78
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,575
- Now, what are you
gonna cut it with?
- Um, baking--

79
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,575
Baking soda.
Not baking powder.

80
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:03,700
Because baking powder guys
will have muffins growing
out of their nose.

You love that joke,
don't you, honey?

You've loved that joke
since you were two years old.

- Okay, I love you.

got me thinking about you.

I puked green slime
and masturbated with a crucifix--

It was my first keg party, Bobby.

92
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:44,158
No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cut out.

93
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:47,158
So you thought you would just climb
through my window...

94
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,283
and we would
play bump-bump?

95
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,450
I was kind of hoping
to get my balls licked,

96
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,242
but I wouldn't wanna break
your little underwear rule,
now, would I?

97
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:57,658
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?

98
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:03,867
Okay. But just for a minute.

for our lives to be over

00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,825
Yeah, my dad.

107
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,033
Okay, stud,
you have to go now.

108
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,492
Oh, um,
about the sex stuff?

109
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:56,950
I was only half serious.
I don't wanna rush you or anything.

110
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:00,325
Hey, would you settle
for PG-13?

111
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:03,033
What's that?

112
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,700

And make sure you take
your behind to class today.

116
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:23,075
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

117
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:25,450
It is when you got
the munchies.

118
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:29,450
- See, that's why
you such a dumb-ass.
- Your mother.

119
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:33,533
You my brother.
That's your mother too, jackass.

120
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:36,908
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, your fathers stupid.

121
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,575
So? I don't know him.

122
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,533
Yeah, me neither.

123
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,408
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

124

you hang out with her.

126
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,617
- She is such a ho.
- Why do you say that?

127
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:59,283
Cause I've seen her.

128
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,200
- My friend Sean
had a pool party this summer.
- Sean?

129
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:04,283
You know, Puff Daddy?

130
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:06,908
Anyway, everybody was drinking
Cristal champagne.

131
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:10,075
And then it started to get wild,
and people were getting freaky
in the pool and stuff.

132
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,283
I look over and there was
your girl getting buck wild
in the Jacuzzi.

133
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:15,992
So?

134
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:19,200
With a backup dancer.

135
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,242
I mean, that's nasty.

136
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,492
That's-That's lower
than the security guard.

137
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:27,450
At least security can get you backstage.
She don't love herself.

138
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,783
Bye, Daddy.
- I don't know. II think
Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

139
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:34,242
She is as fake
as Press-onnails.

140
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,658
Hey, baby girl!

141
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:40,283
What is up,
my sister?

142
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,992
- Bye, Mr. Gilmore.
- Bye!

143
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:44,867
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

144
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,033
Do you like what you see

145
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,575
It's all about the money

146
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,575
[Girl]
Hey, Cindy!

147
00:09:57,617 --> 00:10:00,700
- I love this color.
- Let me see that.

148
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:06,450
- Oh, you guys should
not use this brand.
- Why not?

149
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:09,492
- Because they test
their products on animals.
- So?

150
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:14,158
Look, have you seen what they do
to those poor animals?

151
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,783
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

152
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:23,158
I'd like to feed all the hungry,
little children of the world.

153
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:25,783
I’d much rather help my fellow man
than some animal.

154
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,783
- Spare a dollar?
- Get away from me, you bum!

155
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:30,575
Buffy! Can't you see
he's just hungry?

156
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,617
Here you go, sir.
A nice sandwich.

157
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,242
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch!

158
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:40,617
Ow!

159
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,825
God.
Look at this place.

160
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,325

is in shock...

163
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,742
after the unthinkable
has happened:

164
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:58,867
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead--

165
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,242
- That's it. Two teens dead...
- [Gunshot]

166
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,700
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

167
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:07,325
- Its times like these--
- Police are combing
the area for clues.

168
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,658
There are no witnesses

Hey, do you think the press is gonna
wanna talk to us?

174
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:31,742
Oh, girl, no. The press
only wants to interview the most
ignorant person they can find.

Then she woke up talking about
pressing charges.

181
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,450
So I just pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

182

your last words to Drew?

I mean, what do you think

00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:05,908
Yeah, you guys are right.
If we were,

333
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:10,742
they'd probably cast some dingbat
like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me.

334
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:14,658
Yeah, or they'd cast people
in their late twenties,
early thirties to play us.

throughout the day.

359
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:32,867
Wow. Sounds like we've got the makings
of a serial killer on our hands.

360
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:35,700
Yeah, I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

361
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:39,783
Hey, Doofy, what do you say you and I
go inside my van over there...

362
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:42,575
and, uh, get to know
each other a little better?

A terrible tragedy
and an unbearable loss.

Its days like today
that we need prayer in school.

368
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:05,992
It starts to unravel
the very moral fabric
of our society.

369
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:08,325
Here you go, baby.

370
00:23:08,408 --> 00:23:10,325
Go to your daddy.

Okay, my presentation

And it began on May 25, 1787 in Philly
with George Washington.

381
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,950
And it states, and lleuote,

Oh, shut the fuck up!

00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:25,117
I got a poopie.

397
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:29,200

654
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:42,408
The moron overheard a conversation
Greg and I were having.

655
00:41:42,492 --> 00:41:44,908
- Yeah, but what
if he says something?
- Who's gonna believe...

656
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:47,700
a retarded retard
like him anyway?

657
00:41:47,783 --> 00:41:50,242

I scared him away.

call me a killer than touch me?

Do not travel alone

Always wipe front to back.

721

And remember, never, ever
believe someone...

722

when they tell you
that shaving your pubic hair...

723
00:45:37,158 --> 00:45:40,117
will rid you
of crab infestation.

this is a difficult time
for you young ladies.

to come to my office to talk,

like, ten minutes ago.

was probably murdered...

I’m sorry, Cindy.
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

1213
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:45,450
His name was David Keegan.
Some fishermen found his body
a few weeks later.

1214
01:17:45,575 --> 01:17:48,992
- He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
- That's impossible.

- Then I don't know who it could be.
- Hess gotta be someone...

1216
01:17:53,867 --> 01:17:57,242
who was connected with all the victims,
someone who knew about the accident.

1217
01:17:57,367 --> 01:17:59,992
Someone who could move around
without being noticed.

Has anybody seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

He walks alone
under the big city lights

1228

He always knows
just when the time is right

1229
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:56,242
He never shows what he's thinking
He keeps it inside

1230
01:18:56,367 --> 01:19:00,075
Because he's
too cool for school

1231
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:03,658
He comes alive
when the sun goes down

1232
01:19:03,783 --> 01:19:07,242
He gets it right
You know he's always down

1233
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:10,825
He's got one eye open
and his ear to the ground

1234
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:13,908
And he's too cool for school

1235
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:19,158

this tape right now,

You gotta be quick.

Don't fall down.

And rule number three:
Whatever you do, never look back.
