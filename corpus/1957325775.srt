1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:07,775
*

2
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,807
* Swing low, sweet chariot

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,810
* Comin' for
to carry me home *

4
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:47,681
* A band of angels
comin' after me *

5
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:52,553
* Comin' for
to carry me home *

6
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,062
He specifically said
we had to face east.

7
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,733
Well?

8
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,469
Then you better do it.

9
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,776
Agh!

10
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,754
I think I just ate
some of my dad.

11
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,499
Here's a bone.

12
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,700
(laughs)

13
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,635
I can't.

14
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:46,207
*

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,346
* I don't care what we do

16
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,416
* Don't care as long as I'm

17
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,588
* I and little bench for two

18
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,224
*

19
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,626
This is your captain speaking.

20
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,295
We are now beginning
our journey

21
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:10,631
to Austin, Texas.

22
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,701
*

23
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:19,907
* I don't care where we go

24
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,143
* Don't care as long
as we are *

25
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:29,717
* Hung into an old machine

26
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,521
* Something's gone upstream

27
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,525
* As long as we don't see

28
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:41,462
*

29
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:47,535
* I don't care,
I don't care *

30
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,670
*

31
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:54,375
* I don't care,
I don't care *

32
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,109
* I don't care

33
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,079
*

34
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,648
* I don't care

35
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,684
*

36
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,288
Oh, oops.

37
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,157
Do you, uh, are you okay?

38
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,226
Do you need me to drive?

39
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,130
Yeah.

40
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,299
Yeah?

41
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,033
Yeah, actually, can you...?

42
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,002
Can you just...
get over here?

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,338
Oh, well, why don't we
just pull over?

44
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,439
There's probably--

45
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,174
Yeah,
but we have a lot of gas

46
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,176
and it's too hot
out there.

47
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,844
I don't wanna stop.

48
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,249
Uh, well, I mean
it would be very quick

49
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,250
we could just pull over--

50
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,018
Just get over here, come on.

51
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,119
Well...

52
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,554
just...

53
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,155
It's really...
It's pretty dangerous

54
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,524
to do something like that.

55
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,892
Okay, well,
I'm not steering anymore.

56
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,126
Hey, wait!

57
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,160
Andy, come on!

58
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,262
Seriously, this isn't--

59
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:50,063
It's not funny.

60
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,232
Okay, this is very easy.

61
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,868
I don't think I can do this.

62
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,271
All you have to do
is you go--

63
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,739
You wanna be over or under here?

64
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,008
No, Andy, seriously,
like, let's just--

65
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,209
We can just pull over right now.

66
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,777
Here, let me
pull over right now.

67
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,414
Okay, in five seconds
I'm gonna let go of the gas,

68
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,616
so just make sure
that you've got your foot on it.

69
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,718
Andy, no, don't do that.

70
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,386
I'm not doing this,
I'm not do--

71
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,855
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
of the steering wheel.

72
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,023
Whoa!

73
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,591
Come on, seriously,
this isn't funny.

74
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,959
It's not funny at all.

75
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,728
Put your hands
on the fuckin' wheel.

76
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,862
(laughing)

77
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,397
Now you got me cursing.

78
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,966
(laughing)

79
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,404
(owl hooting)

80
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:43,951
*

81
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:53,961
*

82
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,116
(owl hooting)

83
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,033
Do you think
if women had penises,

84
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,935
there would still be war?

85
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,471
If women had penises,
I wouldn't give a shit

86
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,640
about the wars.

87
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,141
Sometimes I pretend to be a man.

88
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,645
Ooh, the actress likes
to role-play, does she?

89
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,581
Not in bed, just in life.

90
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,315
Like when I really need
something to happen

91
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,753
I just act real tough.

92
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,155
Yeah, you look
fuckin' terrifying right now.

93
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,257
Seriously, it helps.

94
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,126
But, I can't do it
with this audition.

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,195
Why not?

96
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,231
'Cause I'm supposed to be
this noir vixen slaying men

97
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,634
with her feminine power.

98
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,936
Well, I figure
you're pretty well-practiced

99
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,907
at wielding your
"feminine power."

100
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,010
Whatever, I'm still just as shy
as I was in high school.

101
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,178
Shy?

102
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,079
You raised your hand

103
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,481
in every single class,

104
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,615
every day--

105
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,516
That's 'cause I knew

106
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,650
all the answers.

107
00:06:56,684 --> 00:07:00,488
And, boy, how you loved
to show it.

108
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,923
Well, now I have
to show my tits,

109
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,459
so maybe I should be asking
for your expertise?

110
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,995
(laughing)

111
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,763
Okay, you got me.

112
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:18,105
How can you laugh so much
when you're so sad?

113
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,274
Did I look sad?

114
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,478
Sadder than a Christmas tree
on the side of the road.

115
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,179
Thanks.

116
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,916
Seriously, if you're face
was talking about it,

117
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,585
your mouth might as well too.

118
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,625
I gotta pee.

119
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,773
Come on, let's go.

120
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,567
Come, come on.

121
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,175
Go on, open it.

122
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,992
(owl hooting)

123
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,061
(howling)

124
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:10,117
*

125
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:20,127
*

126
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:50,423
* Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above *

127
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:57,330
* With wisdom, power and love,
our God is an awesome God *

128
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,332
You got the spirit in you.

129
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,668
It's coming,
I can feel it coming,

130
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,602
It's coming....all right.

131
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,505
Save me from all my bad habits.

132
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,774
Yes, my child!

133
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,608
The Lord had spoken
and He has said

134
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,277
that you must be saved.

135
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,112
You must be saved,
we must rid you

136
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,783
of all your desires
of the world of flesh and sin.

137
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,786
You must never experience
any fun ever again,

138
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,921
especially any fun
that has something to do

139
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,424
with boobs or wieners
or staying out too late

140
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,827
or cursing
or Beavis and Butt Head.

141
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,096
I don't wanna be saved.

142
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,699
I don't wanna be saved
from all that.

143
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:35,002
What do you wanna be saved from?

144
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,503
I don't need any saving.

145
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:37,570
I'm gonna save you.

146
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,940
Oh, shit.

147
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:47,447
Tell me a bedtime story.

148
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,149
You tell me a story.

149
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,052
I've been talking
to you all day.

150
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,988
As usual.

151
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,524
I know.

152
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,727
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:05,565
I haven't spoken this much
in months.

154
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,134
Why not?

155
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:13,373
I just haven't been able
to tell anyone this story yet.

156
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,977
You can tell me.

157
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,861
We didn't go outside.

158
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,301
Did you make any friends
in there?

159
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,236
No.

160
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,408
People kept trying
to pray for me.

161
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,544
(laughing)

162
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,882
And eventually, I just...

163
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,785
stopped trying to stop 'em.

164
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,987
They were just trying to help.

165
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:06,026
They were just playing parts.

166
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:15,068
There's patients,
care-givers,

167
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18,405
and there's interns
who check pagers five times

168
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,774
while telling you
you're about to die.

169
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,209
(chuckles)

170
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,247
It's like...

171
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,249
you get stuck
in this alternate universe

172
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,551
where everybody's just trying
to keep everybody else

173
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,821
from throwing up.

174
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,859
It's...

175
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,294
totally absurd.

176
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,275
Remember when you
and your dad went to Berlin?

177
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,147
Yeah.

178
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,050
How do you know about that?

179
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,285
He sent us a Christmas card.

180
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,120
"Merry Christmas
from the Dennys,"

181
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,789
spray-painted
on the Berlin Wall.

182
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,559
Baby's first graffiti.

183
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,561
I remember exactly what it said.

184
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,997
"We played with sledgehammers
all day long."

185
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,069
I can't remember that at all.

186
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:30,043
I went to Berlin once
for the film festival.

187
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,980
On our last day
all the streets were blocked off

188
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,082
next to the theater.

189
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,484
I thought they were
just preparing the red carpet

190
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,020
for the closing event,
but then all these policemen

191
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,890
showed up wearing, like,
space suits.

192
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,424
Turns out
some construction worker

193
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,994
found an old,
unexploded bomb, like,

194
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,028
in the ground
where they're trying

195
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,430
to build a shopping mall.

196
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,234
An American pilot, like,
dropped that bomb 65 years ago.

197
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,169
It just burrowed itself
underneath the ground

198
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,872
next to a river
and nobody even noticed it

199
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,273
till now.

200
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,045
I appreciate the fable,
but I'd rather hear

201
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,117
about all the hot Germans
you met at the festival.

202
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,520
I went with my ex-boyfriend.

203
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,622
Y'all broke up?

204
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,991
Yeah.

205
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:22,229
So, you're single
and ready to mingle?

206
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,331
I'm single and ready to sleep.

207
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,867
Don't worry,
I wasn't gonna hit on you.

208
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,370
Not worried, just tired.

209
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,822
Good night, Andy.

210
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,926
(laughing)

211
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,295
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,566
You just look so sexy
in your sleeping bag.

213
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,002
Yeah.

214
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,324
I'm not tired.

215
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,197
Why am I not tired?

216
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,967
Probably 'cause it's,
like, 9:30 P.M..

217
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,505
I thought camping
was supposed to be fun.

218
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,173
You wanna go out?

219
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,408
We can go out,
we could go--

220
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,710
We could go find some townies.

221
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,579
I'm okay, thanks.

222
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,216
All right.

223
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:52,152
I don't want a wussy
for a wingman anyway.

224
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,292
(laughing)

225
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:03,430
Who you callin' "wussy?"

226
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,266
(laughing)

227
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:13,906
*

228
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,878
* Anna Bella blue

229
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,880
*

230
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,350
* She wants those things

231
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,985
So, what do you think,
we'll just pick you a guy.

232
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:30,557
You just--
you can just get him naked.

233
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,558
"Get him naked?"

234
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,525
In the car.

235
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,693
You don't have to do anything,

236
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,395
just take his clothes off.

237
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,231
There's no way
I'd be able to do that.

238
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,301
There's tons of room back there.

239
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,935
I get that there's room,
that's not the--

240
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,504
That's not the problem.

241
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,306
(laughter)

242
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,608
Then what's your problem?

243
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,742
It's...naked?

244
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:50,810
How do you even go about

245
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,245
getting someone naked?

246
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,347
I usually start with the top.

247
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,083
Although, the bottom, it's good,

248
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,184
you can pull a Porky Pig,

249
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,985
just bottoms off, t-shirt's on.

250
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,153
Yeah, but what do I say?

251
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,522
"Hey, can, uh,
I wanna get you naked."

252
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,924
Well, you don't have
to say anything at all.

253
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,958
Just give him like a--

254
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,428
"Can I get you naked?"

255
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,530
Yeah, say,
"Wanna get naked in my car?"

256
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,832
"You wanna get naked
in my car right now?"

257
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,634
Just say, "Come to my car,"
he'll probably

258
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,036
get himself naked.

259
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,838
You're a freak.

260
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:25,044
*

261
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,879
More eyeliner.

262
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,616
I'm supposed to be a spy,
not Cleopatra.

263
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,451
All right,
let's see the script.

264
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,819
No.

265
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,621
Come on, I'm your coach.

266
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,055
You wish.

267
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,024
No, you wish.

268
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,026
And I'm granting.

269
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,030
*

270
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,766
-Andy.
-"Let me help you with that."

271
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,867
That's my line.

272
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,069
Oh, sorry.

273
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:56,776
"I never trust a woman with--
to do a man's job?"

274
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,545
What the fuck is this?

275
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,649
Shut up, it's a period film.

276
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,784
Okay, I'm sorry,
lets do it again.

277
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,419
No.

278
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,054
I promise I won't laugh.

279
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,123
I don't trust you.

280
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:14,461
Come on, don't be a baby, Liv.

281
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,299
All right, puppy.

282
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,073
Wait, which one?

283
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
The one with cargo shorts.

284
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,544
I could tell.

285
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,347
You really do
have terrible taste in men.

286
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,187
Let me help you with that.

287
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,855
All right.

288
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:48,595
You can trust
I always get the job done.

289
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,531
What is that, some kind
of accent or something?

290
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,302
I've been following you
for so long,

291
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,970
it hurts to turn my back.

292
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,673
No, I think I would notice
that you were following me.

293
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,542
Shh...

294
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,851
Yeah.

295
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,188
Okay, out, out!

296
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,089
Get out, get out!

297
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,425
No!

298
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,328
Let me get my damn hat.

299
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,495
You're done with him already?

300
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,130
He's not my type.

301
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,665
You're very humorous,
why don't you take him

302
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,867
for a spin?

303
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:43,783
*

304
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,253
(laughing)

305
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,289
Hey, I-I hit it.

306
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,658
So, that's a small success.

307
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:57,864
*

308
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,634
Okay, what are you
gonna go for?

309
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,436
You're gonna jump it?

310
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,104
This is impossible.

311
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,038
What?

312
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,608
(laughing)

313
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:18,551
*

314
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,720
I'm gonna get a drink,
do you want a drink?

315
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:32,699
*

316
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,267
Oh, you're just in town tonight?

317
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,536
-Yeah, well, no.
-Oh.

318
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,238
My mother lives here as well.

319
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:41,240
She used to live here,
she passed away

320
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:45,845
and I'm just staying here
until her funeral on Wednesday.

321
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:50,283
I just went to my dad's funeral
on Sunday.

322
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,884
Sucks, I'm sorry.

323
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,252
Yeah.

324
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,266
...gonna say if one
of you ladies, you know,

325
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,670
you don't have to worry
about me raping you or anything.

326
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,306
Oh, that should
put me now at ease.

327
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,441
Thanks.

328
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,309
But, you just have to promise

329
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:19,679
that you're not gonna,
like, murder me or something.

330
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,548
(laughing)

331
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,391
(approaching footsteps)

332
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,962
(door opening)

333
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,070
You want a drink?

334
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,376
Yeah, sure.

335
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,378
(laughing)

336
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:01,754
I figured you'd be no good
at being bad anyway.

337
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:12,198
(engine starts)

338
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,033
(thunder)

339
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:32,785
Did you know my dad graduated
from Brigham Young University?

340
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:33,753
What?

341
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,388
Yeah, he was at junior college,

342
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:38,425
but he got kicked out
for sleeping

343
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,192
with the dean's daughter.

344
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,729
Of course.

345
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:46,332
And Grandma had taken in
these boarders to save money,

346
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,069
they were Mormon missionaries,
she got really, really sick,

347
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,039
like, she almost died.

348
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,175
But then, the Mormons
laid their hands upon her

349
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,710
and healed her.

350
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:00,847
Let's go that way.

351
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,017
And then, the Mormons wrote
a letter to their alma mater

352
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:09,221
begging the institution
to take in this son of sin,

353
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:12,158
'cause the Heavenly Father
had just made witness to, ow,

354
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,495
to them that their
one mission on Earth

355
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:24,270
was to save this, my, family
from, you know,

356
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:29,709
the torturous, burning,
fires of Hell.

357
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:02,274
Don't you think
you should say something?

358
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,176
I just said, like, 10 things,
but apparently

359
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,145
you didn't hear
a single one, so...

360
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,148
I mean, don't you think
you should say something, like,

361
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,951
special and thoughtful?

362
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:25,932
Hallelujah!

363
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,636
First Lieutenant
Ludwell Wallace Denny

364
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,773
takes to the skies
for one last flight.

365
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,644
(makes airplane sounds)

366
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:38,745
I'll meet you back at the car.

367
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,179
Don't be a baby,
we just walked

368
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,714
an hour to get here.

369
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44,717
Yeah, we just hiked up
a canyon in a lightning storm

370
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,452
so you could kick off
your dad's ashes

371
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,888
and make me out
to look like an asshole!

372
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,826
I'm sorry.

373
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,764
You know I'm not good
at sentimental bullshit.

374
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:59,532
It's fine.

375
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,000
But when you rope in another p--

376
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:04,070
Do you wanna come
to my mom's house with me?

377
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,639
(thunder)

378
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,344
You're ridiculous.

379
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,081
Why can't you just do
this one thing the right way?

380
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,172
So long, sir.

381
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:44,310
Thank you for your service,
your sense of humor,

382
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:47,546
and all those presents you gave.

383
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,449
(laughing)

384
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,920
Seriously,
he was very thoughtful.

385
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,387
Yeah, but he
would've smacked you

386
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,590
if you called him "sir."

387
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:58,725
You're right.

388
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,092
Right, right, um...

389
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,729
What was his pilot's name?

390
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:04,631
Oh, yeah.

391
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,636
So long, Mr. Pumpkin.

392
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,570
-Great Pumpkin.
-Great!

393
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,976
So long, Great Pumpkin.

394
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,680
Thank you for your presents.

395
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,498
Cool, now we can go.

396
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:49,575
*

397
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:59,585
*

398
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,322
Wait, where is it?

399
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,125
With my purse.

400
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,728
I still don't understand why we
got off the highway so soon.

401
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:45,097
We're just making a pit stop.

402
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,332
Well, I wouldn't ask
so many questions

403
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:49,568
if I had a cigarette
in my mouth.

404
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,704
Fuck.

405
00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:01,447
*

406
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,482
When I look at land like this
I can see why people

407
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,251
want to believe in gods.

408
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:08,487
*

409
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,257
I still don't.

410
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,024
Oh, shit.

411
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:15,361
Whoa, hey, pay attention.

412
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,464
What's it like
to be a good kid?

413
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:21,433
What's it like to be a bad kid?

414
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,369
Pretty fucking good
till someone makes you feel

415
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,939
like being bad is wrong.

416
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:28,307
You're such a badass,
you really do like

417
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,408
to play the victim.

418
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,210
Oh, I'm the victim?

419
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,912
At least I didn't piss
my white panties

420
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,381
because some little townie
tried to show me his third leg.

421
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:41,487
*

422
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,189
-You know what--
-Did you ever find that tobacco,

423
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,423
'cause I really need
a cigarette.

424
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,226
Wait, pull over, pull over!

425
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,428
Now.

426
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,963
This is good, this is good.

427
00:28:50,997 --> 00:29:02,408
*

428
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,676
Chloe!

429
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,146
(laughing)

430
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,715
Chloe, let's go!

431
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:22,829
*

432
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,030
Oh.

433
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:33,705
*

434
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,274
Liv!

435
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:48,354
*

436
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,290
Liv?

437
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:54,460
*

438
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,863
Ugh.

439
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,959
(chuckling)

440
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,366
All right, let's hear it.

441
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,570
Might as well get it
off your chest.

442
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,715
Woo!

443
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,283
Woo!

444
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:58,557
*

445
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,695
* Earthworms eat dirt

446
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,165
* Fish swim below

447
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,867
* Birds fly above

448
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:13,439
* Sharks bite, geese fight

449
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:19,111
* The people you hurt
are the people you love *

450
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:23,582
* People mess up

451
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:29,155
* But try is the word
we reserve for our friends *

452
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:33,625
* Flies eat red meat

453
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,565
* The circle of life
doesn't make any sense *

454
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:49,641
*

455
00:31:49,641 --> 00:32:01,988
*

456
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:06,025
(water rushing)

457
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,937
How'd you know
about this place?

458
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,640
You know about
this place, too.

459
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,042
No, I don't.

460
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,011
(birds chirping)

461
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,412
(laughing)

462
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,614
You have a memory
like a chalk board, girl.

463
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,416
(laughing)

464
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,286
Your dad brought us here
for Indian Princess.

465
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,422
My dad never went
to Indian Princess.

466
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,856
He did once.

467
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,492
And we came here.

468
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:43,162
(bat chirping)

469
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,363
Remember when you got bit
by that bat

470
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,964
under the Congress Bridge?

471
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:47,533
I wish I didn't.

472
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,934
Then you probably shouldn't
run around pickin'

473
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,636
up wild bats.

474
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:51,770
He was wounded.

475
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,938
He was rabid.

476
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,774
(birds chirping)

477
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,177
Wonder when bats come home.

478
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,382
Well...

479
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,885
they're nocturnal so,
they just come home

480
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,788
before the sun
comes up, huh?

481
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,358
(water rushing)

482
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,193
Why doesn't anyone
ever watch that?

483
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,961
(water rushing)

484
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,731
(birds chirping)

485
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:26,105
(crickets chirping)

486
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,641
Jesus Christ, it's beautiful.

487
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,711
(water rushing)

488
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,746
You think Joseph Smith
was schizophrenic,

489
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,117
or just a really good actor?

490
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,553
A little bit
of both, I reckon.

491
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:43,589
Sometimes I couldn't tell
if my dad was a prophet

492
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,792
or just a really,
really good liar.

493
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,561
(bird chirping)

494
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,597
-A little bit of both.
-Little bit of both.

495
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,367
(water rushing)

496
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:05,511
Why do you have
to see your mom?

497
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:09,081
I'm supposed to deliver
whatever's left.

498
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:11,783
I thought she was
in the hosp--

499
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:12,918
She's out.

500
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,087
(water rushing)

501
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:19,057
(bird chirping)

502
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,263
Where is she living?

503
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:27,666
In Onion Creek...

504
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,601
with her sponsor.

505
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,674
Is he cool?

506
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,209
Better than the marine.

507
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,612
(water rushing)

508
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,382
She has a little bit
of a military thing, huh?

509
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,786
I guess so.

510
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:51,557
(cricket chirping)

511
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:59,298
Yeah.

512
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,066
I'll go with you.

513
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,836
(water rushing)

514
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,973
Thanks.

515
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,676
(car passing)

516
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:11,510
Hey, mom.

517
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:15,514
You feelin' better today?

518
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:16,682
I'm sorry,
I never should've called

519
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:19,351
you last night.

520
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,688
Look, the bus won't get
me home any faster.

521
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,291
I made a promise.

522
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,793
I'm trying to do
the right thing here, mom.

523
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:28,527
I gotta go.

524
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,397
I'll call you later.

525
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,367
(traffic passing)

526
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,706
(squeaking)

527
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,185
Hey.

528
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,019
Ta-da!

529
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:57,856
Nice job.

530
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,625
Come on, Claw.

531
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:10,202
*

532
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,070
Have you ever peed
outside before?

533
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,972
(laughing)

534
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,807
Not in awhile, why?

535
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,142
First of all,
you can't pull your shorts

536
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,544
all the way down
to the ground,

537
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:20,612
or you will pee
directly onto your clothing.

538
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:21,747
Shit!

539
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,583
(laughing)

540
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,685
Well, I can't pee now
I know your gay ass

541
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:27,953
is watching me.

542
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:38,029
*

543
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:48,039
*

544
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,813
(birds chirping)

545
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:34,286
I challenge you to a duel.

546
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,692
You're fencing and I'm
life--light sabing.

547
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:41,693
Sabing?

548
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,161
Sabing.

549
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,932
(grunting)

550
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,608
My dad used to say
that killing someone

551
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:57,876
was the most fun
he ever had

552
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,411
with his pants on.

553
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,747
That's messed up.

554
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:09,521
*

555
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:12,691
* As I sit here tonight,

556
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:17,062
the Jukebox playin' *

557
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:23,769
* The tune
about the wild side of life *

558
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:31,009
* As I listen to the words
you are saying *

559
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:37,816
* It brings memories
when I was a trusting wife *

560
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:45,657
* It wasn't God who
made Honky Tonk angels *

561
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:52,063
* As you said
in the words of your song *

562
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:59,605
* There's many times married men
think they're still single *

563
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:06,077
* That has caused many a good
girl to go wrong *

564
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:16,154
*

565
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:22,093
*

566
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:28,767
* It's a shame that all the
blame is on us women *

567
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,604
* It's not true that
only you men--*

568
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:35,273
You know about how far
we are from the Hilltop Motel?

569
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,542
Nope, sorry.

570
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:39,478
* From the start,
most every heart

571
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,147
that's ever broken *

572
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,782
Thanks, anyway.

573
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:44,483
Bye.

574
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,084
Good night.

575
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:50,689
* There always was
a man to blame *

576
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:58,129
* It wasn't God who
made Honky Tonk angels *

577
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:04,936
* As you said
in the words of your song *

578
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:12,711
* There's many times married men
think they're still single *

579
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:18,950
* That has caused many a good
girl to go wrong *

580
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,055
(train whistle blowing)

581
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,493
(bugs chirping)

582
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:31,463
(cars passing)

583
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:47,713
(radio playing)

584
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,699
(laughing)

585
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:29,855
(dishes clanking)

586
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,064
(cups rattling)

587
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:42,500
You know, this wasn't
my first time.

588
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:44,536
Yeah, right.

589
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,471
It's true.

590
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,006
I haven't told
many people this,

591
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,341
but, when I was hanging
out with Hazel in the 11th--

592
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,977
How come you were allowed
to hang out with Hazel

593
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,579
and not me?

594
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,615
Her mom wasn't calling
the ambulance every weekend.

595
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:59,117
I lived in
my own apartment.

596
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,586
Maybe that was it.

597
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:01,987
Anyway.

598
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,123
Hazel took me
to the outlet mall,

599
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:08,660
and we filled up
our bags full of clothes.

600
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,862
My bag was much
bigger than hers, so...

601
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:13,699
I had a lot more stuff
than she did.

602
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:18,236
And, of course,
we got caught.

603
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,404
Yeah.

604
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:22,007
Busted.

605
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,042
They took us all the way
upstairs and made us

606
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,211
empty our bags.

607
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:29,547
They added up how much
money each one of us stole.

608
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:34,352
Well, Hazel got to have
her parents come and get her.

609
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,588
And they handcuffed me.

610
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:39,725
Walked me through
the entire store,

611
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,092
and took me to jail.

612
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:42,994
(laughing)

613
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,095
Yeah.

614
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:47,365
You got arrested
your very first time?

615
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,433
No.

616
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,701
It wasn't my first time.

617
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,637
Oh, you got hooked.

618
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,506
A little hooked.

619
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,844
But just for the summer.

620
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:02,648
It was the best summer.

621
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,215
I can't believe you
were allowed to hang out

622
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,785
with Hazel and not me.

623
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:10,055
It's not your fault.

624
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:14,225
My mom liked you a lot,
she just...

625
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:18,196
couldn't let herself
get close to any crazy people.

626
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,430
Yeah.

627
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:23,769
Yeah, even Christian kindness
has its limits.

628
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,304
If you're wondering why
I never confide in you,

629
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,539
consider this conversation
a prime example

630
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:31,609
of reason one.

631
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,179
(distant chattering)

632
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,717
May I buy you
a piece of pie?

633
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,319
Pie sounds great.

634
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,954
Let's have some pie.

635
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,690
*

636
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:46,591
* I would not call
it sadness,

637
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,028
and I would not
call it pain *

638
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,698
* I would not call
it anger for all

639
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:55,433
that it contains *

640
00:43:55,466 --> 00:44:01,039
* I would not call it lonesome
and leave it for to dark *

641
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:05,010
* I would not call
it anything *

642
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,445
*

643
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,948
* For that would be a lie

644
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,984
*

645
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,853
* I would not
call it magic,

646
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:18,223
and I would not call it love *

647
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,225
* I would not call
it patience,

648
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:22,660
nor pressures
from above *

649
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:26,364
So, why'd your dad want
you to spread his ashes here?

650
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:29,034
I have no idea.

651
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:35,273
* I would not call
them darkness *

652
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:38,543
* Not necessarily

653
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:40,979
*

654
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:46,117
* I would not call it living,
and I would not call it trust *

655
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,686
* I would not call
it meaning, nor--*

656
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,289
Here's to the bald eagle.

657
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:56,027
A noble bird of prey.

658
00:44:57,963 --> 00:44:59,831
Something, something,
Sherman's ass,

659
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:02,968
and shit on Dixie Clay.

660
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,037
You're getting better at this.

661
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,706
*

662
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,876
* I would not call
it changing,

663
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:14,145
and I will not call it fear *

664
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:19,317
* I would not call it closing,
nor will I call it near *

665
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,552
* And I will not call
them phantoms

666
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:24,923
in the eyes of the dear *

667
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:28,526
* I would not call
them anything *

668
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,096
*

669
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:33,464
* For that would be a lie

670
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:39,370
*

671
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:40,571
Who's that?

672
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:44,075
*

673
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:46,044
I'll tell you later.

674
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:55,453
*

675
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:56,922
(bugs chirping)

676
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:58,289
Do you wanna practice
what you're gonna say

677
00:45:58,323 --> 00:45:59,490
to your mom?

678
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:02,060
(buzzing)

679
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,862
No.

680
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:08,499
Thank you, but I...

681
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:11,269
(crickets chirping)

682
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:14,505
(buzzing)

683
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:18,276
(dog braking)

684
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:29,720
In acting class,
we used to do this exercise

685
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:34,192
where you and a partner
like stand...

686
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:38,830
in front of each other
and basically...

687
00:46:38,864 --> 00:46:42,167
like go through a series
of memories together.

688
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:47,172
We can do something
like that if you want.

689
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:49,274
Help you get prepared.

690
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,843
(buzzing)

691
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,815
That sounds like really
emotional, and I don't...

692
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:00,718
I'm not an actor.

693
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:05,991
I mean, I'm pretty sure that...

694
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:09,961
(owl hooting)

695
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,465
(humming)

696
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:15,800
Calm down.

697
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,835
I can't understand you
when you get so worked up.

698
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:20,638
(singing)

699
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,373
Mom.

700
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:25,210
She's going to take me
to my audition.

701
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:30,681
I'm gonna go with her
to her mom's house.

702
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:32,350
Yeah.

703
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:32,884
(singing)

704
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:34,385
(shower running)

705
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:38,523
I think she needs
me here.

706
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,658
I don't know.

707
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,427
Look, I gotta go.

708
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:49,867
You turnin' me in?

709
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,302
Uh, no.

710
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:53,138
Actually, that was
the front desk.

711
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,672
They're requesting
that you stop

712
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,475
murdering whales
in the bathroom right now...

713
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,144
please.

714
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:09,820
Is that a scar
from a nose ring?

715
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:10,421
That one?

716
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:11,456
Mm-hmm.

717
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,658
Yeah.

718
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,927
Didn't you have
a tongue ring, too?

719
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:19,030
Ah!

720
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:22,567
Why'd you get
all those piercings?

721
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,501
'Cause I was a freak.

722
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,303
Remember?

723
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:26,471
Whatever.

724
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:28,739
You just couldn't stand
to have a pretty face.

725
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:30,375
Must've been tough
for a little rebel

726
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,610
like yourself.

727
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,646
I didn't have anything
to do with this face.

728
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,382
Maybe.

729
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,418
But it's got a lot
to do with you.

730
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:49,827
I did it,
'cause it was fun.

731
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,530
Me and Nina,
we'd go over to this guy's house

732
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:54,565
in south Austin
and watch him stick

733
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,968
needles through us.

734
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:18,089
It's really sad
to watch someone try too hard.

735
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:25,730
Okay.

736
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:28,033
I got the scripts and...

737
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,900
some markers.

738
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:32,137
Come here and sit here.

739
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:37,608
Let's see.

740
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,411
This one's good.

741
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,521
That's better.

742
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:53,091
(clearing throat)

743
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:01,399
Don't move too much.

744
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:03,968
Chill.

745
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,136
Don't worry.

746
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,571
I'm not going
to hurt you.

747
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:07,672
Ow.

748
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,707
Oh, come on.

749
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:21,719
Looks pretty good.

750
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,854
All right.

751
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:25,022
Now.

752
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:27,758
Make the cup of tea.

753
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:47,145
A tie.

754
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:49,514
Black tie
for all occasions.

755
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,116
Perfect.

756
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:01,226
All right.

757
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:03,728
Here, put your hair
in a bun.

758
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,139
Nice.

759
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,979
You're looking very
manly so far.

760
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:22,847
Thank you.

761
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,950
Welcome.

762
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:27,452
All right.

763
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:30,455
Now, let's see you
sit like a man.

764
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:40,865
It's like you've
done this before.

765
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:44,869
Perhaps.

766
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:48,173
Okay, um...

767
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,651
Okay.

768
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,923
So...

769
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,091
you're the guy,
obviously.

770
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:07,992
Of course.

771
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:09,727
(clearing throat)

772
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,662
Okay.

773
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,708
Let me help you with that.

774
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,811
I never trust a woman
to do a man's job.

775
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:33,418
You can trust I always
get the job done.

776
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,287
You've got your work
cut out for you, kid.

777
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:42,560
I ain't no kid, daddy.

778
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,867
And I ain't your daddy...

779
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,270
baby.

780
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,907
(laughing)

781
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:58,075
What?

782
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,811
Your breathe smells.

783
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,847
No, it doesn't.

784
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,848
Be brave.

785
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,015
(laughing)

786
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,417
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

787
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:07,885
I can't, I can't.

788
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:11,256
(laughing)

789
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,857
It's just too silly.

790
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,827
This situation calls for some
extreme measures, captain.

791
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:20,598
(heart beating)

792
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,108
What the heck are
you doing, freak?

793
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,144
I'm a very powerful man.

794
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:35,746
This is retarded.

795
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,048
Just shut up.

796
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:40,184
And imagine...

797
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:44,221
that I am a very...

798
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:46,324
powerful man.

799
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:51,061
And I am a very freaked
out girl.

800
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:52,797
Sure.

801
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,199
But I got somethin' you need,
and you may be a scaredy cat,

802
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,867
but you're not a quitter.

803
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,069
How am I supposed to untie
his tie when I'm blindfolded?

804
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,639
A good woman can do
anything in the dark.

805
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:02,973
I don't wanna do this.

806
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,508
Yes, you do.

807
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:04,975
No, I don't.

808
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:06,844
Yes, you do.

809
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:09,013
And you want whole
theaters full of people

810
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:11,716
to watch you do it.

811
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,884
And they will.

812
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,921
But you're so fucking private,
that people will

813
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:20,391
pay attention to you,
even if you never tell

814
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:22,560
them anything at all.

815
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:32,637
*

816
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:42,647
*

817
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:54,925
Let me help you with that.

818
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:58,062
I never trust a woman
to do a man's job.

819
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,831
*

820
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:04,034
You can trust I always
get the job done.

821
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:07,638
You got your work cut
out for you, kid.

822
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:10,274
I ain't no kid, daddy.

823
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,778
And I ain't no daddy...

824
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,613
baby.

825
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:19,384
*

826
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,452
(laughing)

827
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:24,455
They feel like Jell-O.

828
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,256
(laughing)

829
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,126
It feels like a Jell-O Jiggler.

830
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,896
(laughing)

831
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:33,398
A Jell-O Jiggler.

832
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:37,368
(laughing)

833
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,071
A Jell-O Jiggler.

834
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:45,576
Andy.

835
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:03,494
(bugs chirping)

836
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,739
(owl hooting)

837
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:28,719
(train whistle blowing)

838
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:50,074
(dial tone ringing)

839
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,980
(ringing)

840
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:06,457
Welcome to
Andy's answering machine.

841
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:10,495
So, you're asleep
in the motel.

842
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:14,765
And you won't get this message
until we're both back home.

843
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,105
Maybe you hate me right now.

844
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:26,310
Maybe you understand.

845
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:28,312
If not,

846
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:32,216
I hope you can forgive me.

847
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:33,884
I...

848
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:35,553
I love you.

849
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:42,493
(wind blowing)

850
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:07,351
*

851
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:17,361
*

852
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:57,201
(birds chirping)

853
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:07,712
(traffic passing)

854
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:14,218
(pounding)

855
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:23,728
(horns honking)

856
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:46,550
*

857
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:56,560

859
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:57,187

860
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:09,133

869
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,376
Can I take a picture with you?

870
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,544
Oh, sure.

871
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,214
What's your name?

872
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:30,647
Polito.

873
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,248
Polito?

874
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:31,648
Polito.

875
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:32,783
Polito.

876
01:02:32,817 --> 01:02:33,818
Polito, P-o-l-i-t-o,
Polito.

877
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,285
Thank you.

878

885
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,144
-Hello.
-Hey, can you hear me?

886
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:49,013
I can hear
you fine.

887
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:50,680
Okay, can you press
that button

888
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:53,117
that says video?

889
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,319
Um, I see you.

890
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:56,920
Hey!

891
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,722
Cool.

892
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:00,057
Can you
see me?

893
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,292
Not yet,
but if you--

894
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:04,928
Oh, yeah,
now I can.

895
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:05,929
Hoopla.

896
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,331
How's it going?

897
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:09,333
Blood.

898
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:10,767
I got
a new razor,

899
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,737
and I stuck
my hand in

900
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:14,771
to get
my toothbrush,

901
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,141
it sliced
my fingers open.

902
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:19,143
Anyhow, everything
that can go wrong

903
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:22,046
is going wrong,
but you look great.

904
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,481
I had
the opportunity

905
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:27,517
to be a father
to two great daughters.

906
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:29,019
And they're
both bright,

907
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:30,420
they're
both articulate,

908
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:32,322
they're both good
human beings,

909
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:35,059
and one of them is just
about as crazy as me,

910
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:37,827
so I'm a lucky guy.

911
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:40,897
And this is the song

912
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,599
I used to sing

913
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:47,037
when I put
my daughter to bed.

914
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:48,805
She was a little
smaller then,

915
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,074
but no less cute.

916
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:51,641
Oh.

917
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:52,976
* Swing low,

918
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,046
sweet chariot *

919
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,915
* Coming for
to carry me home *

920
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,984
* A band of angels

921
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,553
comin' after me *

922
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:06,756
* Comin' for
to carry me home *

923
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,758
* I looked over Jordan

924
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:11,195
and what did I see *

925
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:13,197
* A band of angels

926
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,499
comin' for me *

927
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,000
* Swing low,

928
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,803
oh, sweet chariot *

929
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:23,973
* Comin' for
to carry me home *

930
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:27,611
So that was
the lullaby.

931
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:30,580
I want you to sing
one of your really raunchy--

932
01:07:30,614 --> 01:07:32,316
It's raunchy.

933
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:34,851
-Okay.
-Okay.

934
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,454
Now, it's
a strange thing

935
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:38,655
when you spend
your life

936
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:41,258
going out 30 nights
in a row

937
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:42,526
dropping bombs
on people.

938
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,061
You have a strange
sense of humor.

939
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,734
Occasionally, we would have
a few margaritas

940
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:53,437
and I would sing
some songs

941
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:56,072
from my time
in Vietnam.

942
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:58,475
* Mary Ann Burns is the queen
of all the acrobats *

943
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:00,444
* She can do some tricks
that'll give a man the shits *

944
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,946
* She can roll a green pea down
her fundamental orifice *

945
01:08:02,979 --> 01:08:05,515
* Flip it with her clit
and catch between her tits *

946
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:06,883
* She's a great big
son-of-a-bitch

947
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,452
twice as big as me *

948
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:10,887
* Hair on her pussy
like the branches on a tree *

949
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,858
* Mary Ann Burns,
she's the girl for me *

950
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:17,261
(laughter)

951
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:19,429
And that's
all, folks.

952
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:21,565
Th--th--that's
all, folks.

953
01:08:27,537 --> 01:08:37,581
*

954
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:46,089
*

955
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:50,059
* Darkness

956
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:52,462
is all around me *

957
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:55,699
*

958
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:59,669
* Darkness,

959
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:01,538
it will not go *

960
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:05,209
*

961
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:09,213
* Creepin'

962
01:09:09,246 --> 01:09:11,515
through my veins *

963
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:14,818
*

964
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:18,822
* Movin'

965
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,657
thick and low *

966
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,293
*

967
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,895
* And I seek nothin'

968
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:28,232
but your decency *

969
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:30,400
* I seek nothin'

970
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:33,069
I need to keep *

971
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,339
* I seek nothin'

972
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:37,907
but this moment *

973
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:39,976
* I seek nothin'

974
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,678
that I must leave *

975
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:44,848
*

976
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:47,016
* If you can cure me

977
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,686
*

978
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,054
* Cure my body

979
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:54,291
*

980
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,092
* Cure my mind

981
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,962
*

982
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:02,899
* So I can sleep

983
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:05,101
* Oh, cure me

984
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,371
*

985
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:13,410
* With your firm

986
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:17,647
and gentle speed *

987
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:27,724
*

988
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:38,468
*

989
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:18,875
*

990
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:28,885
*

991
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,380
Why you washing
in the river

992
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,782
like an animal?

993
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,560
Come on.

994
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:12,215
Look...

995
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:14,951
Andy,

996
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:16,520
I didn't
mean to--

997
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,090
It's your fucking turn
to drive.

998
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,484
(dog barks)

999
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,835
Liv.

1000
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:20,009
Hey.

1001
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:21,010
What?

1002
01:16:21,044 --> 01:16:22,178
You got a--

1003
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,320
Oh.

1004
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:32,922
You saw that from all
the way over there?

1005
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,357
Yeah, you're going
wild, girl.

1006
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,693
You got leaves
in your hair and everything.

1007
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,695
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

1008
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:47,737
Break a leg,
captain.

1009
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,808
Stupid.

1010
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:07,223
Wanna go
for a ride, Chloe?

1011
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:08,658
(dog whimpers)

1012
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:33,616
*

1013
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,118
* Fine

1014
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:38,755
* Don't wait for me

1015
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:42,225
* I'll take my time

1016
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:45,594
* Slowly burning

1017
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:49,899
* I'll take my eye

1018
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:53,169
* Above you

1019
01:17:53,202 --> 01:18:03,246
*

1020
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:10,787
*

1021
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:34,043
Well, how'd it go?

1022
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:35,444
I don't know.
Let's go.

1023
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:38,782
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1024
01:18:38,815 --> 01:18:41,417
I don't know, okay,
so, let's go to your mom's

1025
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,386
since that's the real
reason we came here.

1026
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:45,021
I don't care
about the stupid audition.

1027
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,790
You don't care
about the stupid audition?

1028
01:18:46,823 --> 01:18:48,958
Andy, please,
let's go.

1029
01:18:48,992 --> 01:18:50,626
Please,
just drive.

1030
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,695
Okay, okay,
I'm going.

1031
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,764
I don't even have
my--fuck it.

1032
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:07,343
I didn't know your mom
lived next to a cemetery.

1033
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:14,851
At least she finally gets
along with her neighbors.

1034
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:04,333
You sure you don't want me
to go with you?

1035
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:09,338
No, it's cool.

1036
01:20:09,372 --> 01:20:11,941
I'll just be
a minute.

1037
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,309
Don't rush it.

1038
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:26,035
(sobbing)

1039
01:24:06,209 --> 01:24:07,543
(clears throat)

1040
01:25:09,305 --> 01:25:10,573
You kept
the hat.

1041
01:25:12,675 --> 01:25:15,178
Mhmm.

1042
01:25:15,211 --> 01:25:19,148
What's all this
other stuff?

1043
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:20,849
Some stupid cups
my parents

1044
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:23,152
used to drink out of
when they were married.

1045
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,224
And a piece
of the Berlin Wall.

1046
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:29,692
That's for you.

1047
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:38,267
How'd it go?

1048
01:25:47,176 --> 01:25:48,644
She wasn't there.

1049
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:07,396
They didn't let me read
for the vixen.

1050
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,503
What?

1051
01:26:16,405 --> 01:26:19,508
They had me read
some other role.

1052
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,310
Just some secretary
hopelessly in love

1053
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:23,346
with her married boss.

1054
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:26,815
Uh-uh.

1055
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,687
Fuck that!

1056
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,722
Yeah.

1057
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:37,059
I know,
I know.

1058
01:26:37,092 --> 01:26:38,126
No, no.

1059
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,697
Fuck that!

1060
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,599
Whoa.

1061
01:26:43,632 --> 01:26:45,033
What are
you doing?

1062
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:50,038
*

1063
01:26:50,072 --> 01:26:53,709
We're going
back there.

1064
01:26:53,742 --> 01:26:56,144
Wait, what are
we doing?

1065
01:26:56,178 --> 01:27:07,456
*

1066
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:08,957
We're going in
with pep.

1067
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:19,101
*

1068
01:27:19,134 --> 01:27:20,469
Let me help you
with that.

1069
01:27:20,503 --> 01:27:23,372
*

1070
01:27:23,406 --> 01:27:24,773
Excuse me!

1071
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:26,909
I never trust a woman
to do a man's job.

1072
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:30,679
*

1073
01:27:30,713 --> 01:27:33,248
Trust I always
get the job done.

1074
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:37,653
You got your work
cut out for ya, kid.

1075
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:39,221
I ain't no kid,
daddy.

1076
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,123
I ain't no daddy,
baby.

1077
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:45,794
*

1078
01:27:45,828 --> 01:27:46,695
You trust me now?

1079
01:27:46,729 --> 01:27:47,796
I'd let you
lie to me

1080
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,732
all over again
if I could.

1081
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:51,700
You really strengthen
your guard, officer.

1082
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:55,404
You really should let
yours down, madam.

1083
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:56,605
I've been following you
for so long,

1084
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,040
it hurts
to turn my back.

1085
01:27:58,073 --> 01:27:59,442
Then don't.

1086
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:01,510
Trouble is,

1087
01:28:01,544 --> 01:28:03,278
I only like it
when it hurts.

1088
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:09,518
*

1089
01:28:09,552 --> 01:28:11,153
(mocking gun shots)

1090
01:28:11,186 --> 01:28:21,229
*

1091
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:31,239
*

1092
01:28:51,293 --> 01:28:52,428
Did you see
her face

1093
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:55,364
when you got up
on the desk?

1094
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:57,833
I saw your face.

1095
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:59,602
(girls giggling)

1096
01:29:05,908 --> 01:29:07,242
Let's see them
battle wounds.

1097
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:08,844
-I got one right there.
-Oh.

1098
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:10,312
-It's an early one.
-That's a big one.

1099
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,647
I think we can--

1100
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:18,253
You think
you got the job?

1101
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:21,924
I think that casting director
will never wanna see me again.

1102
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:24,693
Well, I say
that's her loss.

1103
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:26,061
It was
worth it.

1104
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:33,602
You got
a real wound.

1105
01:29:33,636 --> 01:29:34,803
It's fine.

1106
01:29:41,276 --> 01:29:43,378
All better.

1107
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:44,747
Thank you.

1108
01:29:57,793 --> 01:30:00,896
I have to go
to my mom's pretty soon.

1109
01:30:00,929 --> 01:30:03,732
I know.

1110
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:05,100
I'll drop
you off.

1111
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:10,172
Do you wanna come
have dinner with us?

1112
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:30,125
No.

1113
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:31,460
Thanks though.

1114
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:01,156
I really
have to go.

1115
01:31:06,995 --> 01:31:08,263
I know.

1116
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:21,677

1117
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:23,178
Okay, now
close your eyes.

1119
01:31:26,549 --> 01:31:28,350
Remember your
first birthday.

01:31:28,383 --> 01:31:34,289
*

1121
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:35,891
Think about sex.

1122
01:31:35,924 --> 01:31:40,028
*

1123
01:31:40,062 --> 01:31:42,765
Imagine eating
strawberry ice cream.

1124
01:31:42,798 --> 01:31:46,101
*

1125
01:31:46,134 --> 01:31:48,036
Picture your
mom's face.

1126
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:58,480
*

1127
01:31:58,513 --> 01:31:59,948
Okay, now
turn around.

1129
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,922
Remember your
first birthday.

1130
01:32:06,955 --> 01:32:18,734
*

1131
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:20,468
Think about sex.

1132
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:31,113
*

1133
01:32:31,146 --> 01:32:33,481
Imagine eating
strawberry ice cream.

1134
01:32:33,515 --> 01:32:43,859
*

1135
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,560
Picture your
mom's face.

1136
01:32:45,594 --> 01:32:55,403
*

1137
01:32:55,437 --> 01:32:58,406
I wanna do one.

1138
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,643
Okay.

1139
01:33:00,676 --> 01:33:01,944
Go.

1140
01:33:01,977 --> 01:33:12,154
*

1141
01:33:12,187 --> 01:33:13,455
Remember...

1142
01:33:13,488 --> 01:33:23,531
*

1143
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:36,845
*

1144
01:33:37,913 --> 01:33:47,956
*

1145
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:57,966
*

1146
01:34:33,035 --> 01:34:35,838
* In this
very room *

1147
01:34:35,871 --> 01:34:38,040
* We spent the day

1148
01:34:38,073 --> 01:34:43,946
and looked
over antiquities *

1149
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:45,814
* Don't you remember

1150
01:34:45,848 --> 01:34:48,751
* I can't recall
this face,

1151
01:34:48,784 --> 01:34:51,319

1152
01:34:51,353 --> 01:34:52,921

1154
01:34:59,227 --> 01:35:02,130
* In this
very room *

1155
01:35:02,164 --> 01:35:05,768
* We flew
across the sea *

1156
01:35:05,801 --> 01:35:10,305
* The ship will
carry us there *

1157
01:35:10,338 --> 01:35:14,843
* In the ships
I play with *

1158
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:17,212
* Don't you remember

1159
01:35:17,245 --> 01:35:20,749
