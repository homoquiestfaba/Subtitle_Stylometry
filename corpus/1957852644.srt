00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,703
What was it then?

180
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:54,306
I don't know, okay. There you satisfied?

181
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,900
If I thought it to be something
serious I'd be worried about it.

182
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,410
Next subject.

183
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,979
Okay.

184
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,314
Uh, your parents still out of town?

185
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,950
Yup, they are in Tempe,
Arizona, till the end of the winter.

186
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,052
Is that why you weren't sleeping?

187
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,954
I'm sleeping just fine, Gary.

188
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,657
Do me a favor and stop
worrying about it, okay?

189
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,958
I am a big girl.

190
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,394
I happen to care about you, Maris,

191
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,429
a lot, you know.

192
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Why don't you save this tough
act for your folks or something.

193
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,967
This could be something serious.

194
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,236
Fine, you wanna talk about
sleeping problems, Gary,

195
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,238
let's talk about your insomnia.

196
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,774
It's not insomnia.

197
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,610
I'm just having a little trouble
with this new book, that's all.

198
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,213
When I am done I'll be fine.

199
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,616
Anyway, I am not the one
falling asleep on my feet, you are.

200
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,252
Yeah, well, I am sure you
didn't get sleep last night

201
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,754
or the night before that

202
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,789
or the night before that.

203
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,592
Why do you keep beating
yourself like that, Gary?

204
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,828
Those books you are writing
just aren't taking you anywhere.

205
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,764
They are just torturing you

206
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,232
and me with you.

207
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,369
Okay, everything that's wrong
here because of my writing career.

208
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,505
Is that what you want to hear, Maris?

209
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,373
Well, if you're waiting on
the fame and the fortune

210
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,676
to come and make me a millionaire tomorrow,

211
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,077
you can keep on waiting.

212
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,479
Whatever gonna happen with
my stuff is gonna to take time

213
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,915
and you knew that, getting into this.

214
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,984
I have given you all the
time in the world to go out

215
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,420
and chase this fantasy of your's, Gary.

216
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,455
But I'm almost out of college.

217
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,290
It's time to think about the future.

218
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,960
Our future.

219
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,895
Maybe we should just let it go.

220
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,932
What, so I can become a
busboy at the Newport cafe?

221
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,502
Be a banker, no, I could deliver pizzas.

222
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,472
I like what I am doing for living, writing.

223
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,941
You write romance novels for your living.

224
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,910
That's not what you really want, is it?

225
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,045
Hey, it pays the rent.

226
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,147
Yeah, but you are not
going to get anywhere with it.

227
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,983
You're not giving me enough time.

228
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,284
Fine then.

229
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,877
I am sick of your career getting
in the way of our relationship.

230
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,556
You wanna live in
your little fantasy world,

231
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,558
you can go right ahead.

232
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,560
But you have to do it by yourself.

233
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,062
I got to go.

234
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,820
Yoo-hoo, Maris! Maris.

235
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:27,126
Hi, Mrs. Martinak. Mowing the lawn, huh?

236
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,663
Oh, good heavens no. It's just a toy.

237
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,033
My son, Paul, drove by
today and gave it to me.

238
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,268
He is such a good boy.

239
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,872
Don't you just love it? I just love toys.

240
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,340
How is, Paul?

241
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,476
He just doesn't drive all the way out here

242
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,612
to Ridgeway like he is to.

243
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:52,051
Not after that terrible accident
at the junkyard and his divorce.

244
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:56,155
He just doesn't seem to be the same.

245
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,291
It was such a bad time.

246
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,560
Dear lord honey, what's wrong?

247
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,229
You look so sad, so pale.

248
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,597
I am fine really.

249
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,367
Just another bad fight
with Gary again, that's all.

250
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,370
And I am tired a lot lately.

251
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,105
I mean I sleep okay

252
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,458
it just doesn't seem like I
am getting any rest, you know.

253
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,409
Sleep but no rest.

254
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,113
Maybe you are having
a lot of bad dreams then.

255
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,249
I can't remember,
doesn't seem like it though.

256
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,353
You know what they say
about bad dreams, don't you?

257
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,456
They say bad dreams keeps the devil awake.

258
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,292
He'll come crawling into
your bedroom window

259
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,295
while you sleep, looking for your soul

260
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,899
then you'll have really good
dreams but they'll turn real bad

261
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,702
so you can wake up just
in time to turn the lights on

262
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,204
and chase him away.

263
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,006
Devil cannot abide the light you know.

264
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,175
Oh yeah, and what was suppose to happen

265
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,877
if the bad dream doesn't wake you up?

266
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,047
Oh, oh dear,

267
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,150
well, it's just an old
wives's tale, all right.

268
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,419
I am sure I'm fine, Mrs. Martinak.

269
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,155
It's just I have to get
my act together, that's all.

270
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,891
Oh, I am sure you are gonna be just fine.

271
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,227
You are just going through
some really rough times,

272
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,396
what with living in that big old trailer

273
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,865
all by yourself for the winter.

274
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,768
I know, why don't you come on in

275
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,138
let me fix you a nice hot cup of tea

276
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,674
then I can show you all my wonderful toys.

277
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,177
Thanks. I'd like that.

278
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,270
Hello, stranger.

279
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,740
Uh-oh! Hi, Zachariah,
Having a cook out, huh?

280
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,242
Cook out?

281
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,346
[LAUGHS]

282
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,649
You know, I don't remember
to use that expression since

283
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,419
since... the hell since 'Nam!

284
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,421
You know, back during the Tet offensive,

285
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,892
and you were just itching your
daddy's balls back then, Gary.

286
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:24,196
But we had ourselves
one hell of a cook out.

287
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,700
Let me tell you, now, one of them gooks

288
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,037
was using one of them rat tunnels
they was using to run around in

289
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,273
and I said, "Hell with that."

290
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,041
Undrop me a whole canister of napalm right

291
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,378
on top of that little yellow
slain eye bastard, ha.

292
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,581
The hell, what was left of him look like...

293
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,219
it look like one of them bare
ribs Pugsley is eating over there.

294
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,154
Mom!

295
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,857
See what you did, man, now he won't eat.

296
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,792
Our son's gonna waste
away to skin and bones

297
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:57,362
because you had to tell him
one of your sick old war stories

298
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,764
[BURPING]

299
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,466
Oh...

300
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,204
so they're sick old now, are they?

301
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,041
Well, let me tell you something, woman.

302
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:13,478
That boy ought to be thanking me for telling
him how it really went down there in the war

303
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:17,449
He sure as hell ain't going
to get it from watching Platoon

304
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,953
Or Full Metal Jacket.

305
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,989
Don't tune into him, Gary.
It'll just make things worse.

306
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,726
He's still, you know, fighting
soldiers from the sky, dig?

307
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,695
He stays up all night these days

308
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,030
parades around the
house with that rifle of his.

309
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,433
He's probably gonna
end up blowing us all away

310
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,101
in our sleep.

311
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,003
I told you why dammit.

312
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,574
You've seen him yet, Gary?

313
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,609
Seen who?

314
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,545
The Sandman, Gary.

315
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,880
The Sandman.

316
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,250
I thought I was hallucinating
when I saw him back in Vietnam.

317
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,353
Wait for me and my buddies
to go sleep back there

318
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,054
in the dark old jungle.

319
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,359
You get in touch with
death over there, Gary,

320
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,929
That's what of it gets worse.

321
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,633
That's how I probably got
to see him in the first place.

322
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,835
Oh Jesus, dad's tripping again.

323
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:19,077
You hear that old song, "Mr. Sandman,"

324
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,512
[CHUCKLES]

325
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,849
That's why me and my buddies call him that.

326
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,685
You see. You won't see it.

327
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,222
Go to sleep.

328
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:35,027
You won't see it and have
a nice wonderful dream.

329
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,130
And then...

330
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:42,234
He comes out of the dark to get
you like some freaking vampire.

331
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,704
Oh, I thought I had forgotten
about him all this time

332
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,572
I wanted to forget.

333
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,041
I thought it was some old nightmare

334
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,575
and maybe I was still having it

335
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,444
because you see

336
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,246
I have seen him

337
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,214
here.

338
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,917
You know,

339
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,854
bet the VA hospital has
got real good psychiatrist.

340
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,091
First you go check up on that.

341
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,727
Yeah!

342
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,330
I am crazy.

343
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,800
[GIBBERING]

344
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,568
[LAUGHS]

345
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,071
Or maybe you better be real careful.

346
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,039
When you go to sleep tonight, huh, pal.

347
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,943
Real... careful.

348
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,448
Yeah, I'll watch out for him.

349
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,285
Well, I have got to go.

350
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,921
Got a lot of stuff to do.

351
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,758
Still! [LAUGHS]

352
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,694
Hell, I haven't heard

00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,239
This is important.

712
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,108
Right, excuse me, please!

713
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,442
Listen to me.

714
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,044
I am through listening, Gary.

715
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,712
I am not making anything up.

716
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,815
I really did see something
in your room last night.

717
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,251
If that was an apology, pal,
it was the hell of a bad one.

718
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,786
I wasn't trying to apologize.

719
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,187
Then go screw yourself.

720
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,090
Something bad's happening
around here, something really bad.

721
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,693
Yeah, you're finally
starting to lose your mind.

722
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:52,362
I think what I saw in your room last night

723
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,197
is part of it.

724
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,334
I think you want me to go
crazy with you, that's what I think.

725
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,703
I'm not crazy.

726
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,938
You look like you haven't slept in a month.

727
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,173
You look crazy.

728
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,911
Mrs. Martinak died last night.

729
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,716
Died!

730
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,687
Mrs. Martinak, died?

731
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,956
They said she had a heart attack.

732
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,224
They said she died in her sleep.

733
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:22,893
I think I'm gonna be sick.

734
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:25,529
They said she died in her sleep, Maris.

735
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,631
Haven't you been watching the news?

736
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,433
The stuff's happening all over

737
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,600
and I think...

738
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,072
I think whatever I saw
in your room last night

739
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,374
has got something to do with it.

740
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,710
What are you... I can't believe this.

741
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,145
I can't believe you are taking it this far.

742
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,181
How can you stand there and talk like that?

743
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,014
If you just...

744
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,316
Just get away from me.

745
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,051
Don't touch me.

746
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,120
Don't even talk to me. Do you hear me?

747
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,456
You're crazy.

748
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,492
I am not crazy, Maris.

749
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,927
Dammit, I'm not crazy.

750
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,132
Am I?

751
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,737
Gary, my friend,

752
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,506
I think you ought to go home
and get yourself some shut eye.

753
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,108
You really look like hell.

754
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:16,646
With all due respect don't
come back here again, okay?

755
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,814
You are a nice kid.

756
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,650
I'd hate to have to call the cops on you.

757
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,420
I am just running my
business here, you understand?

758
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,074
This is a stupid, stupid idea, Gary.

759
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,710
If I didn't think you were one
week from being carted off

760
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:49,880
to freaking loony being, I would
have never let you talk me into this.

761
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,249
It's morbid, besides that it's illegal.

762
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,484
We gonna get caught, man.
We gonna be on the next episode

763
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,486
of Cops. I am telling you
we are gonna get caught.

764
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,889
We are not gonna get
caught if you shut the hell up.

765
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,158
Damn!

766
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:02,993
Great!

767
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,961
It's locked, okay. Lets go back to my place

768
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,798
I got a bottle of Tequila with
both our names on the label.

769
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:10,700
Granted your name's a little bit bigger on the
label than mine, well, what are you gonna do?

770
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,935
There's got to be another way in.

771
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,904
Yeah, man, it's called illegal entry.

772
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,639
Maybe you have heard of it, my friend.

773
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,974
Besides, why are you so
obsessed with getting into this place?

774
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,010
The old prude is dead.

775
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,079
It's a funny thing about old people, Gary.

776
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,513
They die alive.

777
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,615
I know it's a weirdo concept
for you to handle and all

778
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,385
and not being able to tune
into the reality channel any more.

779
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,586
She was murdered.

780
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,987
Whoa! [SCOFFS]

781
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,190
We whine a little bit,
pal, I read it in the paper.

782
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,892
An old madam died of a heart attack.

783
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,495
A heart attack, Gary, in her sleep.

784
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,597
I think something caused it to happen.

785
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,667
Oh! Let me guess, something
big with glowing red eyes

786
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,836
it likes to eat small animals. Am I right?

787
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,271
I don't know, that's why I
want to get in there to find out.

788
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,574
God! Listen to what's coming
out of your mouth, Gary,

789
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,409
It's crazy and so are you.

790
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,810
I am not crazy.

791
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,313
People are dying in their
sleep all over this place.

792
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,582
How crazy is that? Is that normal?

793
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,184
Is that perfectly reasonable to you?

794
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,921
Well, Gary, my friend whatever it is

795
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,824
it certainly isn't attack of the
50 foot freaking cooty monster

796
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:10,894
amazonia ninja mutant
slime balls from vampire world

797
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:14,498
and Walley world and all these
places combined for crying out loud.

798
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:15,599
How do you know?

799
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,501
Maybe it's really good at hiding,

800
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,169
maybe that's why nobody has ever seen him.

801
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,571
Oh, oh, Gary, hey, did you hear that thing

802
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,207
that was freaking reality
flying out of the window.

803
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,347
Okay, let's say for the sake of argument,

804
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,148
there is some case running around here

805
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,316
What you gonna do if you find it?

806
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,852
Beat the shit out of it, call the cops,

807
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,821
use the force, scary one?

808
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,323
[IMITATING BUZZING]

809
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,827
We'll find out when we.

810
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,529
Just keep watch out here, okay?

811
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:51,001
God, monsters! Jesus Christ,

812
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:53,937
those beat off books really
burn out the poor kid's brain cells.

813
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,272
[LAUGHS]

814
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,008
And they tell me, my dark room
chemicals are no good for me.

815
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,587
Oh, come on, Gary, the old
one-eyed wonder lizard's gotta stake.

816
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,689
Oh! Come on, Gary.

817
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,719
Satan!

818
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,722
Oh!

819
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,337
You should not have looked for me.

820
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:09,306
Bud!

821
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:16,379
What shall be your demise on this...

822
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:24,220
Sleep... Sleep.

823
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,491
So I can devour you.

824
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,461
Bud! For Christ sake,
he is in here with me.

825
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,064
Sleep.

826
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,500
Devour you.

827
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,603
[SCREAMING]

828
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,485
For the Christ sake, Gary,
what the hell is going on in here?

829
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,954
Come on, man, it's getting
late, let's get the hell out of here.

830
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,556
This place gives me the heaves.

831
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,591
Besides, I've gotta
feel like a rain forest.

832
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,999
Hello, boy.

833
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,504
You look like one of them
green privates I had in my

834
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,573
platoon back in Vietnam.

835
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,842
Yeah.

836
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:25,615
I remember this one kid
he... he couldn't be more 19

837
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,551
and one night he was out
taking a leak in on of the latrines

838
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:33,790
when this, god damn goop
chucked his shrapnel grenade

839
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,226
right through the damn latrine door.

840
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,895
Oh...

841
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:44,400
There was blood and guts and shit and piss

842
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,403
and more blood and more piss.

843
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,539
More shit and more guts...

844
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,941
Oh, for Christ sake,
Gary, let's get out here

845
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,643
before I lose my lunch.

846
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,013
Tell me more about the Sandman.

847
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,183
Well...

848
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,918
What do you already know, boy?

849
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,522
I think I saw him, tonight.

850
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,326
Uh, best we hadn't this
conversation here then.

851
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,662
Listen to me.

852
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,632
Whatever this thing out
there is, it's killing people,

853
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,333
it tried to kill me tonight.

854
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,669
Now if you know something about it

855
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:22,005
and it's not just from
your crazy horse shit,

856
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,873
well, then you better damn well tell me.

857
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:27,544
If you have already seen
him it's already too late.

858
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:32,015
I know, anybody ever saw
the Sandman either died

859
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,650
or went crazy.

860
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,654
"Or went crazy," it's a lot healthier.

861
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:40,590
Talk!

862
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,426
Yeah.

863
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:48,498
I've seen him before,
it was during the war.

864
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,169
At the end of our stay in the Tahoe valley

865
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:58,241
that mother got every
last soldier in my platoon.

866
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,911
Except of me and Big Barny.

867
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,083
And when I came out and my beard was white

868
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,452
and I was crazy.

869
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:15,525
When I got back to HQ I kept my mouth shut.

870
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,027
So as the big wigs wouldn't
lock me up in a rubber pokey

871
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,662
and throw away the key.

872
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:24,167
But I know what I saw.

873
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,568
But what the hell was it?

874
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:26,903
Oh! Jesus Christ, Gary,

875
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,372
don't tell me you are actually
buying colonel clink over here.

876
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:31,140
I don't know what it was.

877
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,377
But I think...

878
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,180
I think it's been around for a long time.

879
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,949
Almost as long as we have.

880
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,254
That travels by night like a goon.

881
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,789
Hell, it uses a knife to protect itself

882
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,826
and it's smart, Gary.

883
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,129
I could feel that.

884
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,798
We can't live as long as this thing has,

885
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,767
