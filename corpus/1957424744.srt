through the centuries.

00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:54,888
["Hark!The Herald Angels Sing"
by Wesley and Mendelssohn]

179
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:59,858
- I'm Carol Myers and I have
the St. Nicholas Center.

180
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:02,999
It is primarily a website
and over a million people

181
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:07,210
visit every year and they
come from 155 countries.

182
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,696
We provide resources
for families, churches,

183
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:12,733
and schools for
celebrating St. Nicholas,

184
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,287
so people can
understand who he is

185
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,118
and why he's important today.

186
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:21,052
- He was actually
born in Patara.

187
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:23,226
Patara is located in Lycia,

188
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:26,367
which is now located
in Southern Turkey.

189
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,231
- His family had
been very wealthy

190
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,751
and they died of the
plague when he was young

191
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:34,237
and he had inherited
their entire fortune.

192
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:36,308
He was then raised by an uncle.

193
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:41,624
And as a young man, one of
the most significant stories

194
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:44,627
that has shaped our
understanding of St.
Nicholas occurred.

195
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:47,354
He had heard of a man
who had three daughters

196
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:50,115
and the man had lost,
lost his business,

197
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:52,670
lost his whole
livelihood and had no way

198
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,326
of providing for his family.

199
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,883
- In those days, if children
did not have, you know,

200
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:00,540
little girls didn't
have a dowery,

201
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,922
or little boys didn't have
the money to go to school,

202
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:06,028
the boys would wind
up being servants

203
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:09,859
and the girls would wind up
being servants, or prostitutes.

204
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,481
- This distressed Nicholas.

205
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:13,760
And he tried to think
of how he could help.

206
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,384
- He did have a reputation as
somebody who gave to the poor.

207
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:21,250
And at times he gave
anonymously to the poor.

208
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,218
He didn't wanna be recognized
for his good deeds.

209
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:27,774
That we do know
historically as accurate.

210
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:29,914
- And so in the dark of night,

211
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:31,847
he tossed gold
through the window.

212
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,090
Well, the first
daughter saved the gold

213
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,644
and she was able to be married.

214
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,232
And he did this
again two more times.

215
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:40,303
The third time the
father caught him

216
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,651
and Nicholas asked
him not to tell.

217
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:44,584
But obviously the story got out,

218
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,689
or we wouldn't know it today.

219
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:48,691
But that really is the roots

220
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,211
of St. Nicholas as a gift giver.

221
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,765
[upbeat music]

222
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,014
- I knew that becoming
Santa was more

223
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,532
than just putting on the suit.

224
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,813
I needed to be confident
in what I was doing.

225
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:09,332
I knew that I needed some
professional training.

226
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:10,299
- [Adele] Hello, Santa.

227
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:11,714
- [Jack] Hello, gorgeous.

228
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:14,027
Someone who would help me
answer the difficult questions.

229
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:15,304
Someone who would give me tips

230
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:19,135
on how to present
myself as Santa.

231
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,034
- Okay, here's your finished-

232
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,587
- [Jack] My finished suit.

233
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:24,140
- You're finished, look at this.

234
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,039
- [Jack VOICEOVER] I
needed Santa school.

235
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,661
So I found a school in Denver

236
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,008
that was being taught by
a woman named Susan Mesco

237
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:33,563
who had been teaching
Santas for over 25 years.

238
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:36,152
So I decided I needed
to go to her school

239
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:37,844
and learn from her.

240
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,155
Thank you.

241
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,467
- You're welcome,
it was a pleasure.

242
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:41,157
- I'm sure I'll be
seeing you again.

243
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:41,606
- You better.

244
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:45,058
- [Jack] All right,
thanks Adele.

245
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:48,302
[upbeat country music]

246
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,108
- Welcome to Santa School.

247
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:04,077
You're here to become Santa.

248
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:08,219
This weekend we have
about 20, 25 Santas

249
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:10,428
that have flown in from
all over the country.

250
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:13,569
Most of the men come to me and
say, I'd like to play Santa.

251
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,091
And the first thing I say
to them is we don't play.

252
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:20,680
You're gonna become Santa Claus

253
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,406
and we have 2 1/2 days to do it.

254
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:26,927
What I take first is
what's in their heart.

255
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,653
And then we mold that,

256
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:32,277
give them really the
tools that they need.

257
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:35,625
This is my 27th year of
teaching Santa Claus School.

258
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,767
This is just gonna be the
foundation and the groundwork.

259
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:42,356
What you do with
this beyond here

260
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:44,220
is what's gonna make you.

261
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,497
we're playing a game.

262
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,636
Who brought their
rolls of dimes?

263
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:47,914
- [Man] I did.

264
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:51,434
- Your dimes are because
we don't say the K word.

265
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:52,712
What's the K word?

266
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,921
- [Man] Kids.

267
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:56,198
- Oh, he said it!

268
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:57,164
He owes me, you
owe me a quarter,

269
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:58,441
'cause you already been through.

270
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:02,825
Okay, we don't say the
K word, which is goats.

271
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,242
We don't call children goats.

272
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:09,314
It just doesn't sound nice.

273
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,282
It doesn't sound polished.

274
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:14,181
It doesn't sound
traditional, or magical.

275
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:19,083
But when Santa says, now
children, children gather round,

276
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,569
that is so Charles
Dickensy, isn't it?

277
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:27,574
It just elevates you to
such a level of polish.

278
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,647
So every time you
say the K word,

279
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,822
it goes into this little bank.

280
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:37,308
I'd like to have you
guys tell us who you are,

281
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:41,933
where you're from and why
you decided to be a Santa

282
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,418
and to come here and learn
more about being Santa.

283
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:45,937
Let's start right here.

284
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,456
- My name is Jack Sanderson.

285
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,596
I'm from Los Angeles.

286
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:52,047
I thought I would
make a good Santa.

287
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:56,879
And so I grew my beard out
and was at a target store

288
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,261
and a couple of kids
said, "Hey, it's Santa!"

289
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:00,193
- [Susan] A couple of whats?

290
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:01,125
- A couple of children.

291
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,367
Let me open this roll of dimes.

292
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,267
[audience laughing]

293
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,475
Gosh, darn it!

294
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:08,995
- [Susan] Oh it gets better.

295
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,617
- I was sitting here thinking
I'm not gonna open my roll

296
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,032
of dimes, I'm never
going to say it.

297
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:14,897
I'm never going to
give a dime for it.

298
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:17,417
- Everybody stand up.

299
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:19,384
Santa only hos three times.

300
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,593
- There was a strict ho ho ho.

301
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,147
- [Susan] One, two, three!

302
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:25,114
- [All] Ho, ho, ho!

303
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,771
- Three hos and you're out.

304
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,946
- Go ahead and
make me snowflake.

305
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,914
The Santas will be
very, very frustrated,

306
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,743
because they can't
make a snowflake.

307
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:36,160
No, it's not a snowflake.

308
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,230
Make me another one.

309
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,818
It's a Easter egg!

310
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:41,786
[Susan mimicking buzzing]

311
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:42,994
Make me another one!

312
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:45,065
It teaches them how
hard the children work

313
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:47,585
when they bring
something to Santa Claus.

314
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:52,003
I'm keeping that baby's
attention aren't you?

315
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:54,247
We're just gonna back
you in, princess.

316
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:57,837
Click, boom, picture,
look where you were.

317
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,425
[baby crying]

318
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:03,187
But by the time that child
winds up for the pitch

319
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,396
that baby's back
in mommy's arms.

320
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:08,226
So that is the back
the trailer in.

321
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:09,952
Santa Bill, come on over.

322
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:13,438
- Santa Bill came in
to show us reindeer.

323
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:16,303
He looks like a prospector.

324
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:18,858
- Reindeer is actually the
European name for caribou.

325
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,688
There were nine
subspecies of reindeer.

326
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:24,518
- Initially, Santa Bill smelled
like a friendly mountain.

327
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:28,384
And then as he stood there,
longer, less friendly,

328
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:31,008
but it didn't make
me like him any less.

329
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:33,424
It oddly made him
a little endearing.

330
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,150
- Here's a reindeer in velvet.

331
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,841
- The reindeer was
shorter than I expected.

332
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:39,223
It still had velvet
on its antlers.

333
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:41,535
So the antlers grow
inside the velvet

334
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,537
and there are blood
vessels inside the velvet,

335
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:45,608
which causes the
reindeer to bleed

336
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:47,541
When the velvet
starts to peel off,

337
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,785
or it scratches the velvet off.

338
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:50,613
- [Susan] One, two, three!

339
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:51,442
- [All] Loosey-goosey!

340
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:52,926
- [Susan] Got it!

341
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,101
- Dab it on your
foundation there.

342
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,619
- Pat taught the makeup session.

343
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:59,484
After you get some on you
wanna start applying it

344
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:01,555
on the high spots on your face.

345
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:04,904
- Not a guy you look at
and think, he knows makeup.

346
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,009
- [Pat] You wanna get a
good coat of white stick.

347
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,117
You wanna go the opposite of
the way your eyebrows are.

348
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:13,084
That way you can
make them bushy.

349
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:15,362
- Having put on the
glitter, I thought,

350
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:18,296
I'm never wearing this
glitter when I go out

351
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,988
and do my own Santa.

352
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:22,128
And then when I was looking
at the guys, I thought,

353
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:25,545
that glitter is really
giving them a shine

354
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:27,202
that actually looks pretty good.

355
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:31,931
I'm either really tired,
or my tastes are dropping.

356
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,450
- I want you to start
thinking like Santa.

357
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,314
If you start trying
to memorize this,

358
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:41,941
it's gonna be like a
bad constipation day

359
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,770
when you try to get
that answer back out,

360
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,221
like, oh no, I know he
had it in there somewhere.

361
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,018
[upbeat music]

362
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:50,880
- She's crazy.

363
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,365
- I'm losing it.

364
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:54,298
- You can see she's crazy.

365
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:59,234
- I have no idea, okay,
what I'm gonna do to you,

366
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:00,752
I mean, with you.

367
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,444
- But she's
well-intended, I think.

368
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,790
She's clearly got a kind heart.

369
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,070
- We're all old enough
to remember the day

370
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,556
that the Beatles
hit Shea Stadium.

371
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:14,456
I can remember the
panic and the screaming

372
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:16,285
and the excitement.

373
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:18,908
That is exactly
what a three, four,

374
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:21,911
or five-year-old is gonna feel.

375
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:25,639
Oh my God, Santa's here.

376
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:28,988
Santa is a rock star.

377
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,093
You are the rock star.

378
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:36,581
And if you feel the energy
that the children give you

379
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:39,895
that magic should rock you.

380
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:45,280
It's so important to feel
the love from those children

381
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:51,010
and let them give to you, okay.

382
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:56,532
I'm sorry, it's
just so important.

383
00:16:56,532 --> 00:17:00,709
It's just so important that
you realize how big you are

384
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:05,369
to them and to not take
that bigness into the ego

385
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,267
and to give it back
to those children.

386
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,203
Okay, I'm sorry.

387
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:18,727
A lot of children come to
Santa with huge requests.

388
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:20,487
Give my daddy a job.

389
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:23,007
My mommy's very, very sick.

390
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,698
So-and-so is drinking.

391
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:27,425
I mean, they'll confide
things to Santa Claus

392
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,807
that they won't tell
their mom and dad.

393
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,810
And that is the stark reality
of being a great Santa.

394
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,294
Now remember, Santa is powerful,

395
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:37,090
but he can't control everything.

396
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,059
And you can tell the child
you're not all-powerful.

397
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,959
What the child is looking
for is Santa to understand

398
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,996
and take some kind of action.

399
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:49,482
Your action has
to be believable.

400
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:51,000
Does the child believe
you're really gonna,

401
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,108
oh, I'm going to turn the
sky to green or orange?

402
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,592
Well, guess what?

403
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,594
The child looks up in the
morning and you didn't do it,

404
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,527
so now the child
doesn't believe in Santa

405
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:01,908
and even Santa let him down.

406
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,842
One of the most
important things,

407
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:08,535
your action should
be non-verifiable.

408
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:09,674
Who does Santa know?

409
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:13,299
Oh wait, he knows the President.

410
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,679
Oh goodness gracious.

411
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,061
Has anybody ever wanted
to win a football game?

412
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:19,581
Well, he knows those players
and he knows those coach.

413
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:20,892
Are you getting
the hang of this?

414
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,894
Let's say Santa needs
to fly up to heaven

415
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,793
to give somebody a message.

416
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:25,725
Guess what?

417
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:26,933
Those reindeer fly pretty high.

418
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,935
- In essence, I've
been given permission

419
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:33,940
to lie to children
and to lie big.

420
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:36,356
I've got an in with God.

421
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,220
I've got an in
with the President.

422
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,327
I know the coaches of every
sports team across America.

423
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:44,295
I'm okay with Santa
knows everybody.

424
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:47,609
I'm not okay with Santa
will pull strings for you.

425
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,197
I do believe it's
important that kids feel

426
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:50,439
like they're listened to.

427
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,303
Make eye contact
so that they know

428
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:53,822
that they're being listened to.

429
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:57,274
Empathize, give, the
feelings that they give you,

430
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:58,482
you wanna give back to them

431
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:01,278
so that they know that
you've heard them.

432
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:05,247
My biggest question was:
What do you say to a child

433
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,456
when they ask you
for a specific item?

434
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:09,148
Because you don't wanna
promise them something

435
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,219
that they may or may not get.

436
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:13,186
And the most useful
thing I heard today

437
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,705
was the answer to that question.

438
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:19,227
The answer is: I have a
surprise present for you

439
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,851
and you're gonna find out
on Christmas Day what it is.

440
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:25,060
And it's something I
know you're gonna like.

441
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,926
I go back and forth
between the feeling like

442
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:32,757
I'm gonna be really great at
this and I don't wanna do this.

443
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,621
This is crazy.

444
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:37,003
Tomorrow I think we
drank the Kool-Aid.

445
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:41,145
[upbeat music]

446
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:44,873
[inspiring music]

447
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:57,713
- We'll slide down here.

448
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,370
You can see you got Star Wars.

449
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:04,306
- We went to Target this
morning for a review of toys.

450
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:07,102
- Superheroes, they're back.

451
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:09,794
They never went
away. [chuckling]

452
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,487
You got Batman, you got
Superman, you got Spider-Man.

453
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:15,524
You got Iron Man, you've
got Captain America.

454
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:17,457
- [Jack] There's a Captain
America movie coming out.

455
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:18,286
[Johnny] Is there?

456
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:19,563
- [Jack] Yeah.

457
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,944
I realized that I know
a lot more about toys

458
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:24,740
than I should for a
single man who's 44.

459
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,501
- [Johnny] The
old-fashioned games.

460
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:29,469
You've got new ones too that I
don't know a whole lot about.

461
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,299
- Cranium is a great game.

462
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,887
These guys are in an age
bracket that is not up

463
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:36,062
on the latest movie
or the latest things

464
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:37,546
that kids are looking at.

465
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,790
- [Student] Is this one of
those remote control jobbies?

466
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,309
- [Johnny] I'm not sure.

467
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,310
- [Jack] All the Air Hogs
are the remote controls.

468
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,587
- [Student] Yeah.

469
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:47,384
- I, being immature,
am up on these things.

470
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:48,212
I'm a geek.

471
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:53,044
- Be jolly, be merry.

472
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,598
Be loud as you come
through the door

473
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:56,220
with your ho, ho, hos.

474
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,602
- Our final exam was
the Santa Challenge.

475
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:01,708
Every Santa had to meet
with two children and Susan.

476
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,195
Ho, ho, ho, merry
Christmas everybody!

477
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:09,026
- [Mother] She's a
little shy today.

478
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,960
[child screaming]

479
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,202
- [Jack] You just tell me
what you want for Christmas.

480
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:14,411
- [Mother] You just
gotta just, [mumbles]

481
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,378
tell him what you
want for Christmas.

482
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:17,241
- [Child] No!

483
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,449
- [Mother] Yes you do.

484
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:22,867
[girl speaking in
a foreign language]

485
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:26,077
- Uh, Santa doesn't
speak no Espanol.

486
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,320
[child crying]

487
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,908
- [Child] I don't
want Santa either!

488
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:30,392
- I got this.

489
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:31,704
[Susan retching]

490
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:32,912
- I'm gonna puke.

491
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:36,295
- [Jack] Susan played
a difficult child.

492
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,988
- Do you think that 13
is too young to have sex?

493
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:41,748
- That is really deep.

494
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:45,027
- And her objective was to
provide an impossible challenge.

495
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:46,305
- You're not the real Santa.

496
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,547
- Course I am.

497
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,758
- No! [crying]

498
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,967
[Susan gasping]

499
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,866
- Breathe, breathe.

500
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:57,626
[rapid breathing]

501
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:59,248
- And she had a great time.

502
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:00,457
- I think my water just broke.

503
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:02,286
[Susan rapid breathing]

504
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:03,149
- I know it did, I'm all wet.

505
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:06,048
- Show us the train, Santa.

506
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:07,360
- The train?

507
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,775
- The train.

508
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:11,019
No, no, the train.

509
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:12,400
There you go.

510
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,713
No, the train, right there.

511
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:17,405
I just closed the
train [mumbles].

512
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:21,270
I'm gonna go outside
to smoke a cigarette.

513
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,375
Will you watch my brother?

514
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,618
- Sure.
- Okay.

515
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,309
- I'll watch Victor for you.

516
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,414
- [Susan] Bye Santa.

517
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:28,070
- You probably
shouldn't be smoking.

518
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:31,936
- So we're gonna
stop at the door.

519
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,421
- [Jack] Okay.

520
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:35,319
- Johnny's gonna come out
and talk to us a little bit.

521
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,667
- [Johnny] Now.

522
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,910
- Yes, sir.

523
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,807
- [Johnny] Take
in a deep breath.

524
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:41,636
Blow it out.

525
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,948
Again.

526
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:48,194
- [Man] Here we go.

527
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,405
- Ho, ho, ho.

528
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:55,235
Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas!

529
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:57,755
Goodness, look, my
chair's all ready for me.

530
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,033
Hello young lady.

531
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:02,553
Oh there, we're
almost there, right?

532
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:05,522
Is there anything special
you'd like to tell Santa.

533
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:06,385
- Yeah.

534
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,420
- There is?

535
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,008
What would you like to tell me?

536
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,424
- Um, I like candy.

537
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:14,289
- You like candy?

538
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:19,501
Well, I don't know a girl
that doesn't like candy.

539
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,745
Here's a candy cane for you.

540
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:24,541
Can Santa have one of your
special hugs before you go?

541
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:29,408
Oh ho, that is a special hug!

542
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,409
- Hi Santa.

543
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,307
- [Jack] What's your name?

544
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:33,515
- Carol.

545
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:35,724
- Carol, that's
a wonderful name.

546
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,346
Do you know that
Christmas carols are one

547
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:38,934
of my favorite things.

548
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,040
Are you a Christmas carol?

549
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,249
- Uh-uh, I'm just
really worried.

550
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:47,736
You know, Osama bin
Laden, that everybody's

551
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:52,500
been looking for him everywhere
and nobody can find him,

552
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,226
but you're Santa and
you could find him

553
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,504
and then you could kill him

554
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,161
and then a lot of
people wouldn't be dead.

555
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:02,958
You could save the
whole world, Santa.

556
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,099
- Wanted Santa Claus to
help kill Osama bin Laden.

557
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,102
I don't know any children
except for the one

558
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:12,623
that Susan played, who spend
that much time watching CNN.

559
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:15,454
So what I hear you saying is
you want Osama bin Loden dead.

560
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,489
- Yup!

561
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,663
You got it.

562
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:21,701
- All right, well, Santa
doesn't kill people,

563
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:24,980
but Santa will talk to some
of the people in charge

564
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,432
in the Army and I will see
if I can help them find him.

565
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:31,331
- You're the only
one that can help.

566
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:34,196
Nobody else can help,
Santa, you're the only one-

567
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:35,508
- I have a plan.

568
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:36,785
- [Susan] You're gonna get him.

569
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:39,719
- Would you like me to
tell you what I'll do?

570
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,652
I know people at the UN,

571
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:43,482
I will go talk to
the people in charge

572
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,622
and I will see if I
can help them find him.

573
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,730
- Why don't you just tell
those people where he is.

574
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,111
- Because Santa
is going to help.

575
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:55,148
It was a long circuitous
back and forth.

576
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:57,910
He's a very difficult
man to find.

577
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,050
- He's a bad, bad man.

578
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,327
- He's a bad, mean man

579
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:03,536
and mean people are
excellent at hiding.

580
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,607
May I have one of your
special hugs before you go?

581
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:07,678
- Yeah, well thank you Santa.

582
00:25:07,678 --> 00:25:09,473
- All right, you enjoy that.

583
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:10,509
Goodbye, Carol!

584
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,855
Thank you for coming today.

585
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,617
That was torture.

586
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:16,929
That was torture.

587
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:22,797
["Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky]

588
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,563
[bells jangling]

589
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,047
- They've worked very, very hard

590
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:08,187
and they wanna thank
everybody for coming

591
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:11,984
from wherever you've
come from to see Santa

592
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:15,228
become Santa Claus
this evening, tweak.

593
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:16,057
- Tweak.

594
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:18,646
[solemn music]

595
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,718
- All right, okay.

596
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:22,650
- [Jack] Santa school is over.

597
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,479
I got a Bachelor of Santa.

598
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,653
- [Susan] Congratulations.

599
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:26,688
- Thank you.

600
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,207
[applauding]

601
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:32,798
- Graduation was sweet, but
like a lot of bad theater,

602
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:34,351
there were more people on stage

603
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:35,939
than there were in the audience.

604
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:39,390
I like these guys.

605
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,738
These are regular
guys with good hearts,

606
00:26:41,738 --> 00:26:43,981
probably only one or
two of them are thinking

607
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:46,466
that they're gonna do
this and make money.

608
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:48,607
And the rest I think
are actually searching

609
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,850
for some Christmas spirit.

610
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,507
It's hard to have Christmas
spirit by yourself.

611
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:54,267
You need to have Christmas
spirit with other people.

612
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:55,510
That's a good one.

613
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,547
And so, by being Santa,
you get to meet a lot

614
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:00,653
of other people and
have Christmas spirit.

615
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,415
I absolutely think
it was a success.

616
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,556
I think it was completely
a successful weekend.

617
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:10,629
Going through this
school brought me closer

618
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,390
to Santa as I'm
going to portray.

619
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,360
- Jack is an
amazing Santa Claus.

620
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,845
He has it.

621
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:24,470
He's witty, he's fast, he's
humorous, he's sensitive.

622
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,127
He's very confident.

623
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:27,784
I'm very impressed.

624
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:29,233
- I feel like I could
do it for a season.

625
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:32,823
I don't see myself
making a career,

626
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:34,480
a lifetime career out of it.

627
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,172
Always thinking like
Santa, always being Santa,

628
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:40,417
um, I don't think
I could do that.

629
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:43,385
- He's gonna be one
of the top Santas

630
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:45,594
in the world if he
continues with this.

631
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:52,947
- [Carol] Saint Nicholas died

632
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:56,813
on December 6th,
in 342 or 343 AD.

633
00:27:56,813 --> 00:28:00,264
- The story of St.
Nicholas, as it spreads

634
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,232
through Northern
Europe, it does take

635
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:04,406
on individual belief systems.

636
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:05,891
Of course, it varies
from place to place,

637
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:09,135
whether it be in Germany, or
whether it be in Scandinavia.

638
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:11,551
- The honoring of
the 5th of December

639
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,830
as St. Nikolaustag,
St. Nicholas Day,

640
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,901
is something that's
very much a part

641
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:18,766
of the German, Austrian,
Northern European traditions.

642
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,907
You've made out your list
and you either put it

643
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:24,150
in a shoe or you
put it in a stocking

644
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,704
and you put it out
on the clothesline

645
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,499
and if you were good, whoa,
it would come back loaded

646
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,708
with all kinds of goodies.

647
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,399
And if you were bad,
you were whipped.

648
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,196
Sinterklaas of the Netherlands
is a perfect example of that.

649
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:36,784
He was a moral authority.

650
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:39,718
- In Europe, St. Nicholas
is usually accompanied

651
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,306
by a variety of characters.

652
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,446
In Austria, the
character is Krampus,

653
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:46,863
which is a devil figure.

654
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:51,868
In Germany, it's Knecht
Ruprecht, who is a farm servant.

655
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:56,355
In Czechoslovakia, It's a
devil character and an angel.

656
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:58,909
In the Netherlands
it's Zwarte Piet.

657
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,600
- Zwarte Piet is Black Pete.

658
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,846
He is a figure in the
Netherlands that arrives

659
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:07,055
with St. Nicholas, Sinterklaas.

660
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,439
Zwarte Piet is a Black
man played by white people

661
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:14,235
in black face painting
their faces black.

662
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:16,444
It's a pretty shocking tradition

663
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:18,860
with a pretty shocking history.

664
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,689
- As the story goes,
St. Nicholas was able

665
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:23,900
to enslave the devil for
one day out of the year.

666
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,419
So he will take the
form of Black Peter.

667
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:28,387
He carries the account books

668
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:30,838
and he'll write down the
names of bad boys and girls

669
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:33,116
and year after year
those that are bad,

670
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:36,326
he will kidnap and take off
to diff disagreeable places.

671
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:38,880
In fact, many Dutch
mothers were known to say,

672
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,088
you better watch out

673
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:42,090
or Black Peter's gonna
come and get you.

674
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,747
- What you've had
is the contrast

675
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:47,993
between the good
saintly white person

676
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:52,998
and the suspicious, exotic,
devilish, inferior other.

677
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,759
And in this case, that
would be Black Peter.

678
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,212
- It's not anything that I
thought was still happening

679
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:01,834
in the world today.

680
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:05,838
[singing in a foreign language]

681
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:10,429
Today, Zwarte Piet is the
helper of Saint Nicholas.

682
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:13,121
They're the ones who are
giving out these little treats

683
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:16,400
and they're joking and
they're making funny faces,

684
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,059
not totally intelligent,
but very playful character.

685
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:23,269
- In many places,
especially with children,

686
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:26,755
They don't have a lot of
daily interaction with people

687
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:28,999
that are racially
different from them.

688
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,415
If the only black
people they see

689
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:36,317
are in festivals as
blackface representations,

690
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:39,734
that's probably not
a great foundation

691
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:42,702
for building images
of those people.

692
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,152
- There have been
groups that have tried

693
00:30:44,152 --> 00:30:48,191
to dress up the Zwarte
Piet in different colors

694
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,709
and so they're no
longer Black Peters,

695
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:51,780
but there's orange
Piets and green Piets.

696
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,196
And they're more like clowns.

697
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:55,750
There were huge outrages saying,

698
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,856
you know, you're
killing our tradition.

699
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,066
This isn't the way we
celebrate our holiday.

700
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,515
How can you change it?

701
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:04,932
- People don't like giving
up their traditions.

702
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:07,106
What they'll do is they
will use techniques

703
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:09,039
of neutralization and claim

704
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,008
that they don't mean
what they say they mean.

705
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:14,286
It's a lot easier to say
you got black sliding

706
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:19,256
down a chimney than to say
that he's black because we want

707
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,637
to scare white children.

709
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:37,136
- But most of these
characters are rooted back

710
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:42,038
in the Middle Ages when there
was a much greater sense

711
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:45,731
of the tension and conflict
between good and evil

712
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:48,458
than we feel in
our society today.

713
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:53,428
And these characters have
simply remained from that time.

Phillipsburg, New Jersey,

00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:08,927
where I have volunteered to
be Santa on the Polar Express.

717
00:32:10,618 --> 00:32:12,861
I've been told that it's
four 90 minute rides

718
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:17,280
and on each ride, Santa will
need to visit with 360 people.

719
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:22,699
That's a lot of people in
a brief period of time.

720
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,804
Hi, I'm Santa, good-bye.

721
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:26,496
- All right guys,
welcome to Polar Express.

722
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:28,394
We're gonna go over
everything for you real quick

723
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:30,327
so everyone understand
how everything works.

724
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:31,604
Many of you have
done this before,

Some of you have not, all right.

726
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:35,954
In about 15 minutes you're
gonna board the train.

727
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,025
Once everybody's on the train
we're gonna start going.

728
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:39,923
All the lights will
go out on the train

729
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:42,339
while the Polar Express
song starts going.

Tammy and her crew,
there's Tammy,

731
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,172
will be delivering hot
chocolate through the train.

732
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:48,276
And you're gonna go
through it every six,

733
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:50,382

734
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:52,591
I will say, there's
reindeer on the track

735
00:32:52,591 --> 00:32:54,558
and a big, fat
guy in a red suit.

736
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,975
At that point you'll
slowly stop the train

737
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,942
to hopefully not
knock us off our feet.

738
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,771
When the train comes to a stop,

739
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:04,016

go through the cars,

in each bi-level, in
each section of bi-level.

752

- [Jack] Okay.

753
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:02,833
- All right.

754
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,007
- When Santa comes out,
are we right behind him?

755
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:05,215
- [Don] You're behind
him, yes ma'am.

756
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:07,907
- So after I give the
first bell of Christmas,

757
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:10,772
then I can say, you all
have the spirit of Christmas

758
00:34:10,772 --> 00:34:12,050
and then they can
give out the bells.

of Christmas live?

- [Child] In your heart.

- [Woman] In the heart!

779
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,073
- [Jack] Oh in your heart.

is I'm gonna let the elves

the kids ready for the photos.

wait for Santa to be there

00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:31,516
- [Carol] America probably
never had Santa Claus.

871
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:34,001
When the United
States was colonized,

872
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:36,521
it was primarily the Protestants

873
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:39,178
and Protestants did
not observe saints.

874
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:43,528
And so St. Nicholas was never
the same in this country

875
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:46,220
that he has been in
many European places.

876
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:51,156
- We now see the
Americanizing of Santa,

877
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:53,607
because of course, the
Dutch, it was Sinterklaas,

878
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:58,094
but many of the non-Dutch
neighbors could not pronounce

879
00:38:58,094 --> 00:39:01,511
that, so and they will
anglicize that to Santa Claus.

880
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:05,170
It will be the United States
that will basically change

881
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,759
Santa's image and give
it back out to the world.

882
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:10,934
[instrumental music]

883
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:16,354
At the beginning of the
19th century, St. Nicholas

884
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,150
or Santa Claus is still dressed
in his religious clothes

885
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,738
in the clothes of a Bishop.

886
00:39:21,738 --> 00:39:25,086
In the 1821, "The Children's
Friend," Santa is no longer

887
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:26,122
in the clothes of the Bishop.

888
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:28,366
He's now in a red coat.

889
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,369
He has his name scrawled
across his hat there.

890
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,510
He has one reindeer in that one

891
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,996
before we have eight
two years later in 1923.

892
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,725
The Civil War was
what actually helped

893
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:46,280
to propel Christmas to
becoming the big holiday

894
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,247
here in America that
we know it to be.

895
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:52,424
This happens to
be the front page

896
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:55,945
that was on "Harper's Weekly"
for January 3rd, 1863,

897
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:58,396
showing Santa
sitting in his sleigh

898
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,398
handing out Christmas boxes.

899
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,676
Thomas Nast was an
immigrant from Germany

900
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:05,230
and he did his drawings
here in America.

901
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,923
It was a propaganda piece, no
ifs, ands, or buts about it,

902
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:12,755
in order to show that Santa
had joined the Union cause.

903
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:16,275
That doll is named Old
Jeff for Jeff Davis

904
00:40:16,275 --> 00:40:18,899
of the Confederacy, the
President of the Confederacy.

905
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:20,797
As the article says,
old Santa's tied

906
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:23,386
that chord pretty tightly
around old Jeff's neck

907
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:26,838
and he seems to be kicking
very much at such a fate.

908
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,909
Lincoln would actually call Nast

909
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:32,188
his best recruiting Sergeant
for all his patriotic pictures,

910
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:34,397
as well as his pictures
of Santa Claus.

911
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:37,435
In the 1866 centerfold
that Nast does called,

912
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,920
"Santa Claus and His Work,"
showing him at the North Pole

913
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,199
for the very first time, so no
country could ever claim him

914
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,961
and use him for propaganda
like he did in 1863.

915
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,101
It's also equidistant to
anywhere he wants to go

916
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:51,483
in the world on
Christmas Eve night.

917
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,727
He's sewing all the
dolls clothes himself.

918
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:56,419
He's carving the wooden
toys in the workshop.

919
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:59,215
The elves hadn't even come
along yet at that time.

920
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:01,010
In fact, he's not even
married to Mrs. Claus,

921
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,841
that doesn't have
really officially
happen until about 1899,

922
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:07,050
although there is one
allusion in the 1870s,

923
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,641
he may have been
married to Holly Claus.

924
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:13,954
[drum and fife music]

925
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:16,025
It was during the
Civil War period too

926
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:19,200
that our Christmas customs and
traditions were just coming

927
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,582
to fruition at the
beginning of the Civil War.

928
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:24,343
Christmas trees were
just becoming popular.

929
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:27,243
The first Christmas tree
dealers arrive in New York City

930
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:29,107
to sell to what they
thought were gonna be

931
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:31,868
the German population, but
more people started buying.

932
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:33,939
Christmas cards were
just becoming popular,

933
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:35,734
although they will
not be mass produced

934
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:37,391
until after the Civil War.

935
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:39,600
The very first White
House Christmas tree

936
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,259
was during the administration
of Franklin Pierce in 1856.

937
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:44,674
By the time we get
to the Civil War,

938
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:46,987
there are 15 or so states

939
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:49,230
have declared Christmas
a legal holiday.

940
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,680
Dickens is also serializing some

941
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,751
of his Christmas stories too

942
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,581
in the pages of
"Harper's Weekly."

943
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:57,515
So we have all this
going on at that time.

944
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,587
[drum and fife music]

945
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,899
- Merry Christmas!

946
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:05,453
Ho, ho, ho.

947
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:08,042
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

948
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:18,018
- [Man] Call it a wrap?

949
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,339
- Santa needs a drink.

950
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,548
Santa is wiped.

951
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:36,554
That is a grueling exercise.

952
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,970
I have some Advil back
at the hotel I'm going

953
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,247
to be taking for my back.

954
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:43,595
Santa can tell you firsthand,

955
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:46,391
childhood obesity is
an epidemic in America.

956
00:42:46,391 --> 00:42:49,049
A lot of it has gone across
Santa's knee this evening.

957
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:51,051
I can't believe this
is a volunteer job.

958
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,848
Somebody's getting a deal.

959
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:58,541
- Now you understand the life
of the common day Santa Claus.

960
00:42:58,541 --> 00:42:59,369
[Jack chuckling]

961
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,232
- Yes.

962
00:43:00,232 --> 00:43:03,339
[train bell clanging]

963
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:06,825
It was fun for the
first half of the day.

964
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:09,483
And then for the second
half of the day it was work.

965
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:13,142
As fun as it was, I don't
think I would do it again

966
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:14,419
without getting paid.

967
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:15,523
My voice was killing me.

968
00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:17,146
My suit got all sweaty.

969
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:20,839
My Santa hat got sweaty

970
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:24,360
and I couldn't get it
dry between the rides.

971
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,707
So when I finally put it on

972
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:28,709
at the end of the evening
it was cold and wet.

973
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,919
And it was going through
my mind as I was posing

974
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:34,301
for these pictures
what Susan said

975
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:36,579
about you're gonna
pose for pictures

976
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:38,063
and these pictures are gonna be

977
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:41,204
in people's family albums
the rest of their lives.

978
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,137
And they're gonna
remember them forever.

979
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:45,657
I don't know if I wanna
be in their photo album

980
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:49,454
for the rest of their
lives. [chuckling]

981
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:51,145
[crowd chattering]

982
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:54,217
[child screaming]

983
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:57,013
Somehow, I know this is not
nice, there were a few people

984
00:43:57,013 --> 00:43:58,497
who had writhing
babies in their hands

985
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:00,396
that were like greased pigs.

986
00:44:00,396 --> 00:44:02,709
And they walk toward you
and put the baby on you

987
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:05,297
and you're trying to hold the
baby and smile for the picture

988
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:08,335
and the baby is
contorting and doing yoga

989
00:44:08,335 --> 00:44:10,648
to try and get away from you.

990
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,787
And it's just like, why?

991
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:13,305
You like this child, right?

992
00:44:13,305 --> 00:44:16,826
It's your child and you're
tormenting it this way.

993
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:19,726
Ho, ho, ho, ho. [chuckling]

994
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:21,313
[child loudly screeching]

995
00:44:21,313 --> 00:44:23,350
And I can't say to those people,

996
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,249
uh, Santa can't take a
picture with your greased pig,

997
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:28,182
because that's
what they paid for.

998
00:44:28,182 --> 00:44:30,875
They paid for the picture
with their writhing child.

999
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:32,497
Santa thinks you're
gonna learn to swim

1000
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:34,741
when your parents
throw you in the water,

1001
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,363
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1002
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:40,712
By the way, pigs are cute.

1003
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:45,061
[instrumental music]

1004
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:58,696
- [Cary] The version of Santa
Claus today when you get down

1005
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,733
to the nitty gritty
is not so historical,

1006
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:04,046
but is basically based
on the Coca-Cola Santa.

1007
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:07,808
[gentle music]

1008
00:45:08,982 --> 00:45:11,191
They made Santa
Claus in America.

1009
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,400
- My name is Phil Mooney.

1010
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,713
I'm the archivist for
the Coca-Cola Company.

1011
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,439
Today we're here at the World
of Coca-Cola in Atlanta.

1012
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,789
There are a lot of people
who ask whether or not

1013
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:27,069
we interpreted Santa
Claus, we gave him the red

1014
00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:28,898
and white costume, for instance,

1015
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:30,728
because those are
colors obviously

1016
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,591
associated with Coca-Cola.

1017
00:45:32,591 --> 00:45:34,283
That's certainly not the case.

1018
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:37,424
Thomas Nast was using that red
and white costume character

1019
00:45:37,424 --> 00:45:39,875
very widely in the 19th century.

1020
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,808
- And if you look at the
image, as you can see

1021
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:46,329
that N. C. Wyeth,
Leyendecker, Norman Rockwell,

1022
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:48,193
a number of illustrators
were already

1023
00:45:48,193 --> 00:45:50,609
showing Santa Claus
in red and white

1024
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:55,338
before Coca Cola had their
first illustration in 1931.

1025
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:58,203
- The reason Coca-Cola
began to use Santa Claus

1026
00:45:58,203 --> 00:46:01,068
in advertising, it was
really very interesting.

1027
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:04,175
Soft drinks essentially
were a summertime beverage.

1028
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:07,419
There wasn't a lot of
market for soft drinks

1029
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:08,938
in the winter months.

1030
00:46:08,938 --> 00:46:12,390
And so as they started
to think about how

1031
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,843
to associate Coca-Cola
with the holiday season,

1032
00:46:16,843 --> 00:46:20,570
they started to
think of Santa Claus.

1033
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,919
Here's a guy who has
to go around the world

1034
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:26,611
in 24 hours delivering toys.

1035
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:28,371
He's certainly
gonna get thirsty.

1036
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:31,927
So why not have Santa
enjoying a Coca-Cola?

1037
00:46:31,927 --> 00:46:36,483
And so that was sort of the
germ of the advertising idea.

1038
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:41,281
And so they employed an
artist named Haddon Sundblom,

1039
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:44,422
a very well-known
illustrator of the period,

1040
00:46:44,422 --> 00:46:47,874
to create an image of
the real Santa Claus

1041
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:50,738
pausing from his duties
to enjoy a Coca-Cola.

1042
00:46:50,738 --> 00:46:52,706
You can relate to this person.

1043
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:54,915
It's somebody you'd enjoy
having at your house,

1044
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:56,572
sitting around a table
and talking to him.

1045
00:46:56,572 --> 00:46:58,850
And I think that that's
what most of us take

1046
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,162
from the holiday season.

1047
00:47:00,162 --> 00:47:01,577
It's about family.

1048
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:04,511
It's about being with friends
and it's about sharing

1049
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:06,444
at a very special time of year.

1050
00:47:06,444 --> 00:47:09,067
And I think that's
what Sundblom captured.

1051
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:13,382
And that began a legacy
of over three decades

1052
00:47:13,382 --> 00:47:15,763
of Sundblom creating
a new Santa Claus

1053
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:17,800
for each holiday season.

1054
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,976
There really is only one
classic interpretation

1055
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:24,048
of Santa Claus and that's
the Sundblom interpretation.

1056
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:27,292
[upbeat holiday music]

1057
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,200
- [Jack] We're on our way
to Quincy, Massachusetts,

1058
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,684
where a gentleman
named George White

1059
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:41,859
has enlisted me
to be Santa Claus

1060
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:46,001
in the 57th Annual
Quincy Christmas Parade,

1061
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:48,727
which I've been told is the
second largest Christmas parade

1062
00:47:48,727 --> 00:47:50,212
on the east coast.

1063
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:52,248
George said he had some other
things he may need me to do,

1064
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:54,112
but he hasn't said what yet.

1065
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:56,425
I haven't gotten a call
back from him in over a week

1066
00:47:56,425 --> 00:47:58,910
and I have no idea
what the schedule is

1067
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,636
or where I'm supposed to be.

1068
00:48:00,636 --> 00:48:03,570
[faint phone ringing]

1069
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:04,812
- [George] Hello.

1070
00:48:04,812 --> 00:48:05,917
- Hi, George, it's
Jack Sanderson.

1071
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,056
- [George] Yeah, how you doing?

1072
00:48:07,056 --> 00:48:07,988
- I'm good, how are you?

1073
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,093
- [George] Up to my ears.

1074
00:48:10,128 --> 00:48:11,267
- Up to your ears.

1075
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:12,751
- [George] Yeah.

1076
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:14,650
- All right, so what's, so
tell me what you need from me.

1077
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:15,996
- [George] Well what
I would like to do

1078
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:17,653
is set up a brief meeting.

1079
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:21,312
- Well, I'm here to do
whatever you want me to do.

1080
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,176
- [George] Just swing
by here and pick me up,

1081
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:27,559
we could go, both go
to the fire station.

1082
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:31,736
- Okay, what's your address?

1083
00:48:33,324 --> 00:48:34,670
- [George] You know
where Bridge Street is?

1084
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,534
- [Jack] No, but
I'll find it, 1000-

1085
00:48:36,534 --> 00:48:37,984
- [George] Bridge Street is
the street you're gonna be on

1086
00:48:37,984 --> 00:48:39,778
when you come out of
where you are now.

1087
00:48:39,778 --> 00:48:41,021
- Right.

1088
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,678
- [George] Then you
head towards Quincy.

1089
00:48:42,678 --> 00:48:46,854
Continue through that light
for another two or three miles.

1090
00:48:46,854 --> 00:48:50,651
You'll see a store on the
corner, just take a left.

1091
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:52,274
- What's the store
on the corner?

1092
00:48:56,485 --> 00:48:57,935
- [George] Take a left.

1093
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,868
- Go out here, take a
left, go through the light,

1094
00:49:00,868 --> 00:49:02,042
take another left.

1095
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,217
- [George] You'll
see a road leading up

1096
00:49:04,217 --> 00:49:07,737
to [mumbles] Mile Roadway,
that's not the one.

1097
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:10,257
Go by that one and when
you see the next one

1098
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:12,570
then you'll see the
sign on your right,

1099
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,608
that's where I am roughly.

1100
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,268
- That would've been it.

1101
00:49:21,268 --> 00:49:23,961
- [George] And I'll be right
down the road a way though.

1102
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,756
I'll be staying at the
end of the roadway.

1103
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:29,069
- At the end of Southern Artery?

1104
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:31,485
- [George] Well you'll be
off the Southern Artery

1105
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:34,730
when, I know when
you're going to be going

1106
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:39,493
it'll probably take you
maybe 15 minutes to get here.

1107
00:49:45,499 --> 00:49:47,260
- [Jack] There he is.

1108
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:53,645
Hi George, I'm downstairs
in the lobby for you.

1109
00:49:53,645 --> 00:49:55,923
I'm looking for George White.

1110
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:58,581
- Oh, George, oh, wait a minute.

1111
00:49:58,581 --> 00:49:59,410
- [Jack] You know George.

1112
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:00,859
- [Woman] Yes I do.

1113
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:01,929
And he was here.

1114
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:04,139
I thought this where he came by.

1115
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:05,657
I seem to think he went out.

1116
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:08,350
I don't know where
else he would have gone

1117
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,041
to be honest with you.

1118
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:11,870
Are you his son?

1119
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,562
- No, I'm Santa Claus.

1120
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:17,152
- No, [light chuckle]
all right, wise guy.

1121
00:50:17,152 --> 00:50:18,015
There he is.

1122
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,188
Here he is.

1123
00:50:19,188 --> 00:50:20,017
We've been looking for you.

1124
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,259
- [Jack] Hi George.

1125
00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:22,157
- Super!

1126
00:50:22,157 --> 00:50:23,434
- Thank you.

1127
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:24,366
- Where's the rest of your suit?

1128
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:26,057
- It's in the hotel.

1129
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,231
So I got the car right out here.

1130
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:28,059
You ready to go?

1131
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,681
- I'm ready as you are.

[fire siren blaring]

1133
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,343
- [Jack] George says
we need Santa Claus

1134
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:37,689
in the Quincy Christmas Parade.

1135
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:38,932
- [John] Right.

1136
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:40,520
- So as Santa Claus
I may be riding

1137
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,762
on a fire truck tomorrow?

1138
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:42,901
- [John] Right, up
on top of the ladder.

1139
00:50:42,901 --> 00:50:44,489
The ladder on top of the truck.

1140
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:45,594
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1141
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:46,560
- A seat up there.
- Oh.

1142
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,837
- You have to sit up on top.

1143
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:48,666
- [George] So what do
you think, at midnight?

1144
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:49,632
- [Jack] Seatbelt?

1145
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:51,082
Is there a seatbelt up there?

1146
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:51,669
- Aw we got ladder belts,
we'll strap you in.

1147
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:52,635
- Okay.

1148
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:54,189
- No problem. [chuckling]

1149
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:55,742
- You're just not gonna run me
thorough any cables downtown?

1150
00:50:55,742 --> 00:50:56,570
- I don't think there's
anything that tall enough

1151
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,709
that's gonna hit ya.

1152
00:50:57,709 --> 00:50:58,676
- All right, cool.

1153
00:50:58,676 --> 00:50:59,504
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1154
00:50:59,504 --> 00:51:00,678

00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:28,929
Who else here helped
their mom with the dishes?

1211
00:53:30,345 --> 00:53:32,450
You tell me something you
did that was good this year.

1212
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:36,005
[child mumbling]

1213
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:39,112
Can you say that again,
'cause Santa can't hear well

1214
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:40,113
in this ear?

1215
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:43,703
[child mumbling]

1216
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:46,084
Santa's gonna assume that
was a good thing to do.

1217
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:47,362
[crowd laughing]

1218
00:53:47,362 --> 00:53:48,811
What did you do that was good?

1219
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:49,812
- Um I uh...

1220
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:56,474
- Oh Santa suggests that
this year you pre-plan.

1221
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:00,927
What did you do that was good?

1222
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:04,620
- Um I played with my toys.

1223
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,036
[crowd laughing]

1224
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:10,488
- Okay, what did you do for
someone else that was good?

1225
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:11,765
- Be good for my mom.

1226
00:54:11,765 --> 00:54:13,664
- That was very good.

1227
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:15,907
What are we doing now?

1228
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:16,908
Good-bye?

1229
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:17,737
We're done?

1230
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:19,083
Are we done?

1231
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:21,292
We're gonna go light
the Christmas tree now.

1232
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,569
- [Woman] You are.

1233
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:23,363
- Am I gonna lead
everybody outside?

1234
00:54:23,363 --> 00:54:25,054
- [Woman] I think so.

1235
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:28,161
- Which way is it to
the Christmas trees?

1236
00:54:28,161 --> 00:54:29,438
It's that way.

1237
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:32,890
Well who's gonna show
Santa how to get there?

1238
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:35,341
You will?

1239
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:37,377
All right, I guess we're
all going outside now

1240
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:39,724
to light the Christmas trees.

1241
00:54:39,724 --> 00:54:41,070
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1242
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:46,213
That was a, a seat
of the pants hour.

1243
00:54:46,213 --> 00:54:49,596
I was lost for 30 seconds
when the woman who singing

1244
00:54:49,596 --> 00:54:51,633
just handed me the microphone.

1245
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:54,049
Ho, ho, ho, ho, now what?

1246
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:57,949
Hi, hello, merry
Christmas, young fellow.

1247
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:02,333
I think I used what I
learned in Santa School,

1248
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:06,061
big entrance, loud, merry
Christmas to everybody,

1249
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:08,926
make eye contact with as
many people as possible.

1250
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:10,686
Santa coming through!

1251
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:12,274
Hello Mr. Mayor!

1252
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:13,620
- [Mayor] Santa!

1253
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,690
- [Jack] Thank you for
welcoming me to your fair city!

1254
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,967
- Hey glad to see you.

1255
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,968
- Hello sir.

1256
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,970
- I love you!

1257
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,247
- You know this boy?

1258
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:21,179
- He's one of our
great Quincy kids.

1259
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:22,629
- Oh.

1260
00:55:22,629 --> 00:55:23,906
I know the Simpsons has been
on the air for 20 years,

1261
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:26,323
but if ever a Mayor
Quimby existed,

1262
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,118
twas the Mayor of Quincy.

1263
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:32,398
- [All] Five, four,
three, two, one!

1264
00:55:33,606 --> 00:55:36,919
[crowd cheering]

1265
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:39,784
- Oh Mr. Mayor, it's beautiful!

1266
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:42,200
And suddenly everybody
wanted a picture.

1267
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:45,445
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

1268
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:47,136
I think it went very well.

1269
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:49,104
I had a number of
people say to me,

1270
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:50,692
you are the best
Santa we ever had.

1271
00:55:50,692 --> 00:55:52,314
Are you being good?

1272
00:55:52,314 --> 00:55:53,142
- Yeah.

1273
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:54,351
- You are?

1274
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,076
Are you being good
to each other?

1275
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:56,905
[All] Yeah.

1276
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:58,320
- You are, all right.

1277
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,666
Are you playing together nicely?

1278
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:00,460
- Yeah.

1279
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,599
- Mom, are they?

1280
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,567
- They're doing great.

1281
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:08,572
- Once I helped with a
door in my classroom.

1282
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:10,539
- [Jack] You helped with
a door in your classroom?

1283
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:11,471
- Yeah.

1284
00:56:11,471 --> 00:56:12,714
- Well that was very good.

1285
00:56:12,714 --> 00:56:14,267
Would you like to
ring the bells?

1286
00:56:14,267 --> 00:56:16,856
I guess to be able to walk
in there and feel prepared

1287
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:19,721
and go with the flow and be loud

1288
00:56:19,721 --> 00:56:21,723
and know how I'm
gonna present myself

1289
00:56:23,138 --> 00:56:25,623
is a direct benefit of having
attended the Santa School.

1290
00:56:28,868 --> 00:56:31,422
If I hadn't attended
the Santa School

1291
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:33,700
I might not have thought
of having a big entrance

1292
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,874
or of having the bells.

1293
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:39,326
Susan's suggestion of
having the bells, great.

1294
00:56:39,326 --> 00:56:40,811
- [Child] Can I ring the bells?

1295
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:41,950
- [Jack] You may ring the bells.

1296
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,227
Go ahead, ring the bells.

1297
00:56:43,227 --> 00:56:47,024
Bells are a terrific
prop, crutch, tool.

1298
00:56:48,335 --> 00:56:49,820
The bells are good.

1299
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,236
Who's got their hand
on Santa's butt?

1300
00:56:52,236 --> 00:56:53,927
- [Fireman] [chuckling] Not me!

1301
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:55,412
- All right.

1302
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,343
[chuckling]

1303
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:57,621
- This is two pillows.

1304
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,174
- All right now.

1305
00:56:59,174 --> 00:57:00,555
Santa's sorry he started.

1306
00:57:02,004 --> 00:57:04,524
This is a terrible
admission to make.

1307
00:57:04,524 --> 00:57:09,529
Being Santa is a job that I
enjoyed doing this evening,

1308
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:12,739
it made me happy.

1309
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:15,880
Thank you for coming tonight.

1310
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,226
It was nice to meet you.

1311
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,331
Goodnight.

1312
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:20,885
[gentle music]

1313
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:27,202
- People wanna feel good

1314
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:28,479
and people wanna
know the essence

1315
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:29,687
of what Santa was about.

1316
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:33,657
And the more you talk about
it, the more they embrace it.

1317
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:35,866
And it happened right
here in Massachusetts.

1318
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:38,834
My name is John Marion.

1319
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:41,043
I am the President
of Tuxedos by Merian,

1320
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:45,116
which is a family-owned
business since 1951.

1321
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:46,842
We're third generation here.

1322
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:50,467
This store is located
in downtown Brockton,
Massachusetts.

1323
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,744
Brockton is the
home of the first

1324
00:57:51,744 --> 00:57:54,194
department store
Santa, James Edgar.

1325
00:57:55,368 --> 00:57:58,095
He took the images
from Thomas Nast

1326
00:57:58,095 --> 00:58:00,442
and decided that he
would travel to Boston

1327
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:02,962
and get a Santa suit made.

1328
00:58:02,962 --> 00:58:07,449
In his store in 1890
December, he had his suit on

1329
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:10,107
and walked the floor
and picked the girl

1330
00:58:10,107 --> 00:58:12,074
with the prettiest
ribbon on her hair

1331
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:14,076
and gave her a Christmas doll.

1332
00:58:14,076 --> 00:58:16,147
The following year we see

1333
00:58:16,147 --> 00:58:18,322
other department
stores copycatting.

1334
00:58:19,185 --> 00:58:20,635
And that's how the tradition

1335
00:58:20,635 --> 00:58:23,051
of that kinda started it's way.

1336
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:28,056
Before James Edgar, Santa Claus
was only in illustrations.

1337
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:30,748
There was no Santa
Claus walking around.

1338
00:58:30,748 --> 00:58:32,785
There was no Santa
Claus in a store.

1339
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:34,856
There was no Santa Claus
that you could visit

1340
00:58:34,856 --> 00:58:38,515
and talk to him about
your wish list of toys.

1341
00:58:39,654 --> 00:58:41,276
James Edgar brought him to life.

1342
00:58:42,726 --> 00:58:46,523
Children look up
to that character

1343
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,180
in ways of which I
can't even imagine.

1344
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,493
I think that in
order to play Santa,

1345
00:58:51,493 --> 00:58:54,254
you have to be a very
unique individual,

1346
00:58:54,254 --> 00:58:56,912
one that understands
how important

1347
00:58:56,912 --> 00:58:59,397
a role it is to
play Santa Claus.

1348
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:03,678
- You'll find out from
talking to just about anybody

1349
00:59:03,678 --> 00:59:05,783
that does this, it's not
a job, it's a calling.

1350
00:59:05,783 --> 00:59:09,615
- Everyone in my family
believes this is my destiny.

1351
00:59:09,615 --> 00:59:11,409
- Well actually the first
time I ever played Santa

1352
00:59:11,409 --> 00:59:14,205
I was only 12 years old, so
I think it was predestined.

1353
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:16,104
- Some things in life,
you're chosen to do them.

1354
00:59:16,104 --> 00:59:19,935
And this is one thing, I was
just chosen to make kids happy

1355
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,696
and try to bring a little
bit of joy in their life.

1356
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:22,973
- When I got into this business,

1357
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:24,388
I got into it for the money.

1358
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:27,391
I do it now because I love it.

1359
00:59:27,391 --> 00:59:29,013
- If you do it
more than one year,

1360
00:59:29,013 --> 00:59:31,498
then it's something that
you were always meant to be.

1361
00:59:31,498 --> 00:59:33,811
And I was meant to do and
I firmly believe that.

1362
00:59:33,811 --> 00:59:36,573
- You have to live the part.

1363
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,160
You have to love kids.

1364
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,302
You have to love
bringing joy to the world

1365
00:59:42,302 --> 00:59:44,477
and joy to the people you meet.

1366
00:59:44,477 --> 00:59:46,410
- I realized there are
literally thousands

1367
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,862
of Santa Clauses
performing this work

1368
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:51,933
and they're all doing
it for the same reason,

1369
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:55,005
that's to make people
happy and see them happy.

1370
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:57,801
- The children are the
most important thing.

1371
00:59:57,801 --> 01:00:00,804
It's not you, you're
playing the role of Santa.

1372
01:00:00,804 --> 01:00:03,530
But to children, you
can give them delight

1373
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,326
and joy that lasts
them for a lifetime.

1374
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:10,814
- I've always believed that
the magic of Santa Claus

1375
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:14,749
is something that a child
should always experience.

1376
01:00:14,749 --> 01:00:16,992
And I've made that
my goal in life.

1377
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:18,822
- My personal mantra
as the years go on

1378
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:22,446
is just to always be the Santa
I always wanted as a child.

1379
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:23,689
And as long as you
strive for that,

1380
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:25,035
you're gonna do really well.

1381
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:27,693
- I want 20 years
from now, the kid

1382
01:00:27,693 --> 01:00:31,524
that sat on my lap today,
to come back with their kids

1383
01:00:31,524 --> 01:00:32,456
and sit on my lap again.

1384
01:00:32,456 --> 01:00:34,320
I want, that's my vision.

1385
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,149
- It made me more
trusting of people.

1386
01:00:37,288 --> 01:00:39,843
It made a more
loving person of me.

1387
01:00:39,843 --> 01:00:41,430
It changes you.

1388
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,985
And if it doesn't, then you
shouldn't be a Santa Claus.

1389
01:00:43,985 --> 01:00:46,297
- I have the best
job in the world.

1390
01:00:46,297 --> 01:00:47,091
This is it.

1391
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:50,198
It can't get any better.

1392
01:00:50,198 --> 01:00:52,752
[upbeat music]

1393
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,550
- [Bette] Good
afternoon, everyone.

1394
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:01,416
And welcome to the 57th annual
Christmas Festival Parade.

1395
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:02,348
Gorgeous day!

1396
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:03,625
- [Joe] Beautiful day.

1397
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:04,902
- [Bette] Perfect
day for a parade.

1398
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,740
- [Man] The new guys
don't touch nothing.

1399
01:01:15,913 --> 01:01:17,190
All right, Santa.

1400
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:19,883
It's strapped in pretty
good, so you can stand.

1401
01:01:19,883 --> 01:01:21,125
It's not going anywhere.

1402
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,333
Mind you, we're not
moving that fast.

1403
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:25,543
- [Jack] All right,
all right, that's good.

1404
01:01:27,442 --> 01:01:28,270
Merry Christmas!

1405
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:29,824
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1406
01:01:30,825 --> 01:01:32,723
Merry Christmas!

1407
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,552
Merry Christmas!

1408
01:01:34,552 --> 01:01:36,623
Merry Christmas!

1409
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:37,797
Merry Christmas!

1410
01:01:37,797 --> 01:01:40,248
As Santa in the Quincy
Christmas Parade,

1411
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:41,387
I did an awesome job.

1412
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,390
Merry Christmas!

1413
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,805
Ho, ho.

1414
01:01:45,805 --> 01:01:47,255
Hello!

1415
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:48,566
Merry Christmas!

1416
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:49,878
One of the reasons
I did a good job,

1417
01:01:50,914 --> 01:01:52,363
it wasn't that hard.

1418
01:01:54,262 --> 01:01:55,608
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1419
01:01:55,608 --> 01:01:57,299
The parade was pretty awesome.

1420
01:01:57,299 --> 01:02:01,269
The parade was one of the
more fun things I've done

1421
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:03,098
in a few years.

1422
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:05,411
I remembered the tips
I got from other Santas

1423
01:02:05,411 --> 01:02:09,380
to make sure you're look at
both sides of the street.

1424
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,349
There were a lot of
people out there.

1425
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:16,767
I think I got the feeling
of the rock star Santa.

1426
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:19,045
Merry Christmas.

1427
01:02:19,045 --> 01:02:22,911
People were screaming,
Santa, Santa.

1428
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:24,361
I'd look over and wave at them

1429
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:26,846
and then they'd be thrilled
that I had heard them.

1430
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:28,330
Merry Christmas!

1431
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,747
And it was nice to have
people be excited to see me,

1432
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:35,268
because in my nine-to-five job,

1433
01:02:35,268 --> 01:02:37,374
people are usually
not excited to see me.

1434
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,694
I still feel a very solid
line between Jack and Santa

1435
01:02:47,694 --> 01:02:50,283
and I'm relieved
by the solid line.

1436
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:54,460
At the end of the parade
we went up to the airfield.

1437
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:59,361
There had to be hundreds of
children up there at that field.

1438
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:01,191
Wow, what a big crowd.

1439
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:03,710
Like the President of
United States was gonna come

1440
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,747
down the line and
shake everyone's hand.

1441
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:09,130
And that's who I was in that
moment, I was President Santa.

1442
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,683
- Say ho, ho, ho!

1443
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:13,893
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

1444
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,068
Oh thank you.

1445
01:03:16,068 --> 01:03:17,966
A lot of children
handed me letters.

1446
01:03:17,966 --> 01:03:19,899
Have you've been a
good boy this year?

1447
01:03:19,899 --> 01:03:22,108
- Can you give me a
water gun and [mumbles]?

1448
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:26,078
- Oh my goodness, well I dunno

1449
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:29,322
about Santa bringing people
guns, but I'll work on it.

1450
01:03:29,322 --> 01:03:31,738
I'll do the best
I can, all right?

1451
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:33,016
Look at you wrapped
up like a present.

1452
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:36,157
What a lovely bow you
have on your head.

1453
01:03:36,157 --> 01:03:38,331
- What are the Elves names?

1454
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:40,126
- Well the top elf
is named Jingles.

1455
01:03:40,126 --> 01:03:42,819
And he's in charge of
managing all the other elves.

1456
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,097
Jingles is sort of a
middle-management elf.

1457
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:49,273
Mrs. Claus is good,
thank you for asking.

1458
01:03:49,273 --> 01:03:50,412
Merry Christmas.

1459
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:51,379
Are you being good?

1460
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:54,865
Uh huh, that's what I thought.

1461
01:03:56,108 --> 01:03:58,696
[gentle music]

1462
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:04,910
I know that the
Santa's persona comes

1463
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,119
with a level of responsibility.

1464
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,813
I knew that, but
to experience it

1465
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:13,401
is a different level of knowing.

1466
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,750
When I was up there
greeting the children

1467
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,717
and saying hello to
all those children,

1468
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:26,276
I felt the true level
of responsibility to it.

1469
01:04:27,725 --> 01:04:30,280
[gentle music]

1470
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:42,809
- The line between Gary and
Santa is very, [chuckling]

1471
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:46,606
very, uh, it's not there.

1472
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:52,129
Everything in my closet
is red or khaki or green,

1473
01:04:52,129 --> 01:04:55,684
but I have a truck that kinds
of says, I'm Santa Claus.

1474
01:04:55,684 --> 01:04:58,066
- I go to a restaurant,
it's like being a celebrity.

1475
01:04:58,066 --> 01:05:00,620
I have people interrupt
me at dinner to ask me:

1476
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,761
Do you know you look
like Santa Claus?

1477
01:05:03,761 --> 01:05:04,901
Really?

1478
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,316
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

1479
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:09,906
- When I went to a natural
beard I couldn't be me anymore.

1480
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,012
I had to be Santa Claus.

1481
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:14,703
- The line between
myself and Santa,

1482
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:17,914
I don't know that there
is a real difference.

1483
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,916
- I'm Santa Ron Robertson.

1484
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,194
- [Jack] And what do you
do when you're not Santa?

1485
01:05:22,194 --> 01:05:23,540
- I'm never not Santa.

1486
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,611
- There's no true
division of life.

1487
01:05:25,611 --> 01:05:27,889
I consider myself more Santa
Claus than anything else.

1488
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:30,961
- Every day I wear red;
red pants, red shirt,

1489
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:33,239
red socks, black shoes
most of the time.

1490
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:34,482
I'm Santa.

1491
01:05:34,482 --> 01:05:37,485
- Even when I'm digging
and doing landscaping.

1492
01:05:37,485 --> 01:05:40,005
When a kid sees me
and they're like,

1493
01:05:40,005 --> 01:05:42,007
is it possibly that's Santa?

1494
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:46,770
And I give them that wink
and their eyes light up,

1495
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,220
automatically that's Santa.

1496
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,911
It happens every
day and I love it.

1497
01:05:49,911 --> 01:05:53,673
- The fact is, the fact, if
you're going to be Santa,

1498
01:05:53,673 --> 01:05:57,815
that it's important that you
maintain that image 24/7 365.

1499
01:05:57,815 --> 01:05:59,783
If they look at you and know,

1500
01:05:59,783 --> 01:06:02,613
you know immediately
that they know.

1501
01:06:02,613 --> 01:06:05,133
Mom, mom.

1502
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,654
- There's not a day that
goes by that I'm not

1503
01:06:08,654 --> 01:06:12,278
reminded several times
that I am Santa too.

1504
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:15,178
I've always had one fear always,
one will walk up some day

1505
01:06:15,178 --> 01:06:17,283
and didn't get what he wanted
and kick me in the shin.

1506
01:06:17,283 --> 01:06:19,630
But that hasn't happened yet.

1507
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,874
[cheering]

1508
01:06:27,155 --> 01:06:28,087
- Dear Santa.

1509
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:33,990
Racing Down the Rails
Set, the Thomas Train,

1510
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:38,995
train table, kindergarten,
"Moon & Stars."

1511
01:06:40,927 --> 01:06:43,413
Love Max.

1512
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,004
Well, I'm fine, Max.

1513
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,006
Thanks for asking. [chuckling]

1514
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,594
And it's just a
seven simple items.

1515
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:55,770
The moon and the stars.

1516
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:58,359
Anthony, Anthony's
parents were very smart,

1517
01:06:58,359 --> 01:07:01,569
because this is, as you
can see, a photocopy.

1518
01:07:01,569 --> 01:07:05,331
Make Your Own Mask, Design
& Drill Activity Center,

1519
01:07:05,331 --> 01:07:08,714
Play and Freeze ice cream
maker, Take-Apart Crane,

1520
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:12,131
Build It Big Brick
Construction, extra mortar,

1521
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:16,653
Bloco Animal building Set,
Extreme big Bubble kit,

1522
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:21,658
Puppy Pursuit Games,
Carnivorous Creations

1523
01:07:22,383 --> 01:07:23,798
and an Aquasaurus.

1524
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:27,284
I don't know what
an Aquasaurus is,

1525
01:07:27,284 --> 01:07:28,975
but I think I might want one.

1526
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:33,704
Train table and play board,
concert and master violin,

1527
01:07:33,704 --> 01:07:36,880
talking self-service
gas station,

1528
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,747
Junior Space Explorer
Inflatable Shuttle.

1529
01:07:43,749 --> 01:07:44,922
Awesome!

1530
01:07:44,922 --> 01:07:46,476
If this were my kid,

1531
01:07:46,476 --> 01:07:48,823
I would feel like I
was doing a good job.

1532
01:07:48,823 --> 01:07:51,515
He's got a huge
range of interests

1533
01:07:51,515 --> 01:07:53,759
and he clearly wants
to get involved.

1534
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:55,416
That's awesome.

1535
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:57,763
Anthony, Santa will try.

1536
01:07:57,763 --> 01:08:00,076
I don't know what I'm gonna
do with these letters.

1537
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,664
I'm not, I can't, you
can't throw them away.

1538
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,668
[gentle music]

1539
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:14,883
- Hi, I'm Pete Fontana.

1540
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,506
I'm a customer
relations coordinator

1541
01:08:16,506 --> 01:08:18,232
for the New York Post Office.

1542
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:21,649
And I'm also in charge of
Operation Santa in New York.

1543
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:24,203
All the letters to
Santa that are addressed

1544
01:08:24,203 --> 01:08:27,482
Santa Claus, North Pole
come to Operation Santa

1545
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:28,932
in the post office.

1546
01:08:28,932 --> 01:08:32,315
We anticipate anywhere between
300 and 500,000 letters

1547
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:35,180
to Santa right here in
the New York Post Office.

1548
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:37,561
Nationally, we expect
to receive millions

1549
01:08:37,561 --> 01:08:40,116
of letters to Santa this year.

1550
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:44,810
The letters to Santa are
opened and sorted and redacted,

1551
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:47,123
which is just a fancy term
for taking all the personal

1552
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,710
information out of the letters.

1553
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:52,128
What we give them is
a code on the letter.

1554
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,682
We leave the first names,
what the children want,

1555
01:08:54,682 --> 01:08:57,788
their clothing sizes
and people come in here,

1556
01:08:57,788 --> 01:09:00,515
read through these letters,
decide which ones can fit

1557
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:04,036
into their budget or
which ones touch them.

1558
01:09:04,036 --> 01:09:07,729
And then they go out, buy the
gifts and package them up,

1559
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:09,179
get them ready for mailing.

1560
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:11,906
And in New York we have
five designated post offices

1561
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:14,080
where they can mail
these packages.

1562
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,911

1571
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:42,247
One year we had a letter that
had a special needs wheelchair

1572
01:09:42,247 --> 01:09:44,732
and the kid sent us the
picture of the wheelchair.

1573
01:09:44,732 --> 01:09:47,597
It had all the special
attachments on the wheelchair

1574
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:50,876
and the wheelchair cost
over $20,000 to purchase

1575
01:09:50,876 --> 01:09:52,602
and the family
couldn't afford it.

1576
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:53,982
They didn't have
health insurance.

1577
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:55,950
So I made sure that
this particular letter

1578
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,297
made it into the
daily newspaper here.

1579
01:09:58,297 --> 01:10:01,024
The next day I had
that wheelchair.

1580
01:10:01,024 --> 01:10:02,405
Soon as it was
published in the paper

1581
01:10:02,405 --> 01:10:04,579

The first Santas appeared
on the streets of LA in 1902

1615
01:11:35,843 --> 01:11:38,466
and the program gradually
crossed the country

1616

the only ones.

1623

are formerly homeless,

formerly drug addicted,
their health is compromised.

1625

You know, one of the
things we believe

1626
01:11:57,002 --> 01:11:59,315
is that people truly can turn
their lives around for good

1627
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,971
and so we end up
hiring some of them

1628
01:12:00,971 --> 01:12:03,491
and some of them are
our best employees.

1629

- [Jack] Why the white belts?

1630

- Why the white,
to distinguish us.

1631

To distinguish us
from the real Santa.

1632

We put a lockbox in there

1635
01:12:11,982 --> 01:12:14,191

stand out on the corner

And I have a son who's 20
years old who has a girlfriend

1722
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:30,111
and spends a lot
of time with her

1723
01:15:30,111 --> 01:15:32,804
and especially Christmas
Eve with her family.

1724
01:15:32,804 --> 01:15:35,807
I do my fly bys
on Christmas Eve.

1725
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,637
I do church on Christmas Eve.

1726
01:15:38,637 --> 01:15:42,503
And when I went home
that night, I was just,

1727
01:15:42,503 --> 01:15:44,540
I felt so alone.

1728
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,957
I know that sounds funny that
Santa needs a place to go

1729
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:52,444
on Christmas Eve, but
maybe that'll help me deal

1730
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:56,586
with that loneliness that
sets in when I come in

1731
01:15:56,586 --> 01:16:00,901
about one o'clock in the
morning on Christmas Eve alone.

1732
01:16:00,901 --> 01:16:03,524
[gentle music]

1733
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:06,423
- Oh my goodness! [gasping]

1734
01:16:06,423 --> 01:16:07,908
What a wonderful hat!

1735
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:09,185
Hi!

1736
01:16:09,185 --> 01:16:10,704
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1737
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:13,879
- To stop believing in Santa
Claus at an appropriate age

1738
01:16:15,156 --> 01:16:17,952
is a completely
foreign concept to me.

1739
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:19,575
I kind of feel sorry for people

1740
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,474
that stop believing
at any certain time.

1741
01:16:22,474 --> 01:16:23,613
- Merry Christmas.

1742
01:16:23,613 --> 01:16:24,959
- [Jack] Merry Christmas
and you know what?

1743
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,167
- There might not
be a Santa for you,

1744
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:27,859
but there's a Santa for me.

1745
01:16:27,859 --> 01:16:30,586
I'm sorry that you don't know,
better go figure that out.

1746
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,208
Everybody else is unenlightened.

1747
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:35,798
- Is the faith the fact
that there's a gentleman

1748
01:16:35,798 --> 01:16:39,077
in the North Pole that
actually comes in a sleigh

1749
01:16:39,077 --> 01:16:41,873
that actually lands on your
roof, that comes down a chimney,

1750
01:16:41,873 --> 01:16:43,357
that puts all these toys there.

1751
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:44,910
Is that what we're believing in?

1752
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:47,119
Or are we believing
in the goodness

1753
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:49,397
and the kindness of humanity?

1754
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:52,021
The fact that we've created
a story for a child,

1755
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:54,264
but as adults, we
actually perform

1756
01:16:54,264 --> 01:16:56,439
what it is that
this being's doing.

1757
01:16:56,439 --> 01:17:00,305
- I don't think there's
anything better about humans,

1758
01:17:00,305 --> 01:17:03,584
anything more redemptive about
humans than when we give.

1759
01:17:03,584 --> 01:17:05,241
- And whether it's
doing it for charity

1760
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:10,246
or just to bring joy to
your child or a loved one,

1761
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:12,938
there is, there's
something wonderful

1762
01:17:12,938 --> 01:17:15,078
about being a secret giver
and doing it mysteriously.

1763
01:17:15,078 --> 01:17:20,083
- We need a person
or a force out there

1764
01:17:21,257 --> 01:17:23,915
to promote the ideas of
goodness and kindness

1765
01:17:23,915 --> 01:17:27,228
and generosity and
happiness and joy.

1766
01:17:29,748 --> 01:17:31,508
- [Jennifer] I think
Santa is maybe a bit

1767
01:17:31,508 --> 01:17:33,476
of a common
denominator for us all.

1768
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,100
- There are Christian Santas.

1769
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,412
There are Jewish Santas.

1770
01:17:38,412 --> 01:17:39,724
There are Muslim Santas.

1771
01:17:39,724 --> 01:17:41,380
There's a Buddhist Santa.

1772
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,899
There are Wiccan Santas.

1773
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:44,314
And there were
probably Santas who

1774
01:17:44,314 --> 01:17:45,557
have never seen the inside

1775
01:17:45,557 --> 01:17:47,559
of a place of worship
in their life.

1776
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:49,216
What do they share in common?

1777
01:17:49,216 --> 01:17:50,907
They share the belief
that love, hope,

1778
01:17:50,907 --> 01:17:52,426
and joy is the best of us.

1779
01:17:52,426 --> 01:17:56,119
- For me, Santa Claus helps
deliver all of those feelings

1780
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:58,950
that should be present
in all religions.

1781
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:03,195
I think that he creates
this magical experience

1782
01:18:03,195 --> 01:18:05,957
for people without having any

1783
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:09,374
of those roadblocks
that we put up.

1784
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,515
I don't think we mean to
put up those roadblocks,

1785
01:18:12,515 --> 01:18:13,827
but we do.

1786
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:18,832
- Along the way, as
I'm becoming Santa,

1787
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:28,496
he is real, I'm convinced,
because he's it.

1788
01:18:29,877 --> 01:18:32,742
He is the only thing that
is keeping the spirit

1789
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:37,747
of giving and compassion and
concern for others alive.

1790
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,234
[gentle music]

1791
01:18:46,618 --> 01:18:48,309
I don't know what my
father's intentions were

1792
01:18:48,309 --> 01:18:50,691
when he put on that Santa suit.

1793
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:53,763
If he was looking for
Christmas spirit or not,

1794
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:54,730
it doesn't matter.

1795
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:57,663
Point is, when he
put on the suit,

1796
01:18:57,663 --> 01:18:59,631
like all the guys
that put on the suit,

1797
01:19:00,977 --> 01:19:04,498
he created Christmas spirit
by giving of himself.

1798
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,466
One of the things that I loved
about the people that I met

1799
01:19:07,466 --> 01:19:10,159
is that some of them were
living in their bliss

1800
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:14,094
and they provide great
examples of how to live.

1801
01:19:14,094 --> 01:19:17,304
Peter Fontana, who works
at Operation Santa Claus

1802
01:19:17,304 --> 01:19:20,341
in New York loves
the job that he does

1803
01:19:20,341 --> 01:19:22,999
and seems to be the
perfect guy for that job.

1804
01:19:22,999 --> 01:19:26,416
He is really fulfilled by
the job that he's doing.

1805
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:27,348
Susan Mesco.

1806
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:33,734
I'm gonna say Susan is crazy,
but she has found her niche

1807
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:37,289
and she is thriving within it.

1808
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:40,948
Rachel Weinstein at
Volunteers of America,

1809
01:19:40,948 --> 01:19:43,399
clearly great at what she does

1810
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:45,919
and thriving in what she does.

1811
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:50,924
Jeryn Calhoun and Santa Bob
from Vegas, both social workers,

1812
01:19:52,339 --> 01:19:54,582
Santa Sandy runs a halfway
house for recovering addicts,

1813
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:57,793
Santa Earl and his
wife ran a home

1814

handicapped children

1815

out of their own home
for over 20 years.

1816
01:20:02,418 --> 01:20:04,800
When I think of
all these people,

1817
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,802
I suspect that they
all had kind hearts

1818
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,287
before came to the
jobs that they do.

1819
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:12,600
They all enriched their lives
by helping other people.

1820
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:18,468
Those to me are
examples of how to live

1821
01:20:18,468 --> 01:20:22,162
and lives well-spent,
whether they're Santa Claus

1822
01:20:22,162 --> 01:20:23,819
or whether they're
working with Santa Claus,

1823
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,235
or whether they're
using Santa Claus,

1824
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:28,030
everything that they're doing

1825
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:31,619
is to help other people
improve their lives.

1826
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:33,035
There are lots of
people on TV who

1827
01:20:33,035 --> 01:20:34,588
will tell you how
to live your life

1828
01:20:34,588 --> 01:20:38,695
and the Santa community
lives their lives

1829
01:20:38,695 --> 01:20:41,560
as an example of how
to treat each other.

1830
01:20:43,424 --> 01:20:45,737
That is an awesome thing to see,
