1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,010
I only have one memory of her.

2
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,110
A dream.

3
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,680
A nightmare.

4
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,650
Stop it you're such an animal.

5
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,270
I am. A big one.

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,410
What was that?

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,400
I don t know,

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,420
but stay here.

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,140
Where are you going?

10
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,980
I need to stop them,

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,000
but I can't.

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,430
How can you leave me?

13
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,440
They say

14
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,250
it only takes 2 hours.

15
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:21,800
2 HOURS

16
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,190
The end of the world

17
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,830
killed off most of the living,

18
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,730
but a few of us survived

19
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,490
and resisted our turn
for extinction.

20
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,260
We fought back and we went on living.

21
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,250
We were gathering supplies
along these tracks,

22
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,070
stocking up this outpost

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,360
so we could defend ourselves
from the infected,

24
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,280
and the virus,

25
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,640
our beautiful gift to the world.

26
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,600
I'd rather put a bullet in my head,

27
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,080
than become one of those
flesh eating pieces of shit.

28
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,510
But I won't have to.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,590
There was a group of survivors
waiting here for me.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,900
But these train tracks
aren't safe anymore

31
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,500
and they're the only way
back to Compound U-1.

32
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,290
Where there's a cure,

33
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,150
a rose blooming in this
god forsaken wasteland.

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,230
I just need to find the survivors.

35
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
(Whispers): what was that?

36
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,440
After she was gone

37
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,670
I wished she had never existed.

38
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,190
Those were days of fear,

39
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,680
killing to survive.

40
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,630
Not knowing what terrors
would come next.

41
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,170
But then I found the other survivors.

42
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,840
They'll be heading for the woods,

43
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,480
where the trees are still beautiful,

44
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,250
still alive.

45
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,070
Where they say,

46
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,240
the infected just wander aimlessly

47
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,670
like lost souls searching
for a reason to exist.

48
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,150
(Whispers): Stay here.

49
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,760
The virus turns the mind
against itself.

50
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,780
It will use her to confuse me,

51
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,750
slow me down.

52
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,950
I need to find the survivors soon,

53
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,060
but to do that I'll have to get past

54
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,630
these stupid, drooling,
brainless animals.

55
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,850
If I can make it to woods

56
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,570
beyond these ruins I'll be safe.

57
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,130
But getting there in one piece
is a different story.

58
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,150
If I'm not careful

59
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,910
every one of these infected
bastards will come running.

60
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,590
(Walkie Talkie): Can anyone hear us?
Is anyone still alive out there?

61
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,080
(Walkie Talkie): The train tracks
have been overrun. 

62
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,500
(Walkie Talkie): We're heading
to the woods now.

63
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,430
(Whispers): Where are you going?

64
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,770
(Whispers): Where are you going?

65
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,460
You're such an animal.

66
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,660
I need to stop them.

67
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,310
We're only little pretty bones,

68
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,340
and then we change.

69
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,210
Like leaves

70
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,670
blowing in the wind.

71
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,090
I can feel the virus

72
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,350
flooding my mind

73
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,160
with whispers from my past.

74
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,730
And blurring all of my memories

75
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,420
from the last 2 hours

76
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,970
With the nightmare
that always haunts my dreams.

77
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,370
I try not to think about her.

78
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,310
But she's always there to punish me.

79
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,510
Now I can't tell whether I'm sleeping,

80
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,840
or waking.

81
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,980
She's slowing me down.

82
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,830
I need to avoid her and keep moving.

83
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,990
I'm running out time.
I have to find the survivors.

84
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,660
(Whispers): Stop resisting.

85
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,630
Pull yourself together,

86
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,340
stay focused and keep moving.

87
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,990
There's still time,

88
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,050
you can make it.

89
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,520
It's messing with your head,

90
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,000
it wants to confuse you.

91
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,500
You can still survive this.

92
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,840
Don't listen to the whispers

93
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,150
the survivors are close.

94
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,560
(Whispers): You're going to die.
Look at yourself!

95
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,900
- Leave me alone.
- You're wandering in circles.

96
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,390
Think about how you got here.

97
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,940
Well it wasn't safe.

98
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,240
I had to find the survivors.

99
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,740
(Whispers): This was never about
the survivors,

100
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,110
they can't help you.

101
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,610
Bullshit, it's the virus.

102
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,750
Just ignore it.

103
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,320
Keep moving.

104
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,910
You're almost to the survivors,
they can keep you alive.

105
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,920
(Whispers): You don't want to live.

106
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,890
You left the tracks.

107
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,180
The only way to the cure.
You're only chance to survive.

108
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,620
I need to keep looking
for the survivors.

109
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,910
(Whispers): You're not listening.
You need to be looking for her.

110
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,930
She's dead and gone.

111
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,820
(Whispers): You've been avoiding
this since it happened.

112
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,820
(Whispers): You should've
stayed on the tracks.

113
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,360
I had to leave.

114
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,940
You need to face this or you'll
relive this nightmare forever.

115
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,300
The survivors are here in the woods.

116
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,820
(Whispers): the woods pulled
you away from her.

117
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,940
You left her to die scared and alone!

118
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,710
You killed her. 

119
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,590
Murderer!

120
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,700
What was that?

121
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,560
Stay here.

122
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,730
Where are you going?

123
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,920
Help.

124
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,890
Help.

125
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,880
Help.

126
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,230
Help.

127
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,160
How can you leave me?

128
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,380
I only have one memory of her.

129
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,900
A dream.

130
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,240
A nightmare.

131
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,350
I need to stop them,

132
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,000
but I can't.

133
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,960
No one can.

134
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,300
The time for our extinction

135
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,190
is finally here.

136
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,450
And we can only resist for so long

137
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,160
until we see the beauty of it.

138
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,770
In my dreams

139
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,000
she was always leading me
down the tracks,

140
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,100
bringing me closer to her.

141
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,800
Trying to wake me

142
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,090
from the nightmare of living,

143
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,960
and I hated her for it.

144
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,610
But she only wanted us

145
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,090
to be together again.

146
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,760
I needed to lay to rest

147
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,830
the nightmare that haunted me

148
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,560
so I could face the change

149
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,420
that was always coming.

150
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,400
Sometimes the most

151
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,210
beautiful moments in life

152
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,840
come from the worst ones.

153
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,770
I loved her more than anything.

154
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,960
But it took this

155
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,430
to help me understand that.

156
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,160
The virus is the cure,

157
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,810
but we've tried so hard

158
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,780
to resist it.

159
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,440
We've been so afraid

160
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,200
of an unknown future

161
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,640
that we've lost sight of
the beauty all around us.

162
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,210
Among the wastelands of our lives,

163
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,770
beneath the ruins of our cities,

164
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,150
a rose is blooming

165
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,120
and it is wonderful.
