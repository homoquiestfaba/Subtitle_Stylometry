Today's topic is violence.

7
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,407
How do you feel about violence?
Have you been
personally affected by it?

8
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,144
Have you ever been tempted
to go over the edge
and hurt someone?

9
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,547
Do you think violence is
overrated, or should we all
be wearing protection?

Hi, Erin.
You have a nice voice.

15
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:02,763
What do you think
about violence?
I think it's awful.

16
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,899
We should be able
to live together
without killing each other.

17
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,036
But we've returned
to the Middle Ages, and we're
all behaving like animals.

You all know
that a civilian videotape...

Of this incident
has surfaced in the media.

172
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,984
The only thing you have to say
to any reporters right now
is "no comment."

173
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:37,990
Internal Affairs
is gonna investigate this
till we're blue in the face.

174

you were the senior officer
at the scene.

Initiated a pursuit
of the suspect, sir.

178
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,439
And the suspect turned with
what appeared to be a weapon?

179
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:55,542
After several verbal warnings,
yes, sir.

180
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,709
And you state that
his heavy body armor...

181
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,946
Was the reason
for excessive force...

182
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,015
In your attempt
to neutralize the suspect.

183
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,217
Yes, sir.

Who fired the killing shot?

Somebody needs to answer
the chief of detective's
question now.

We all fired, Captain.

whose bullet actually...
- It was my shot, sir.

He can't say that.
You can't say that, Morgan.

- We all shot at him.
- All right. All right.

Hey, Morgan,
why did you do that?

193

There's no way
you can be 100% certain
that that was your shot, man.

You got any information
on that kid in the shooting?

they pay.

How should we remember him?

502
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,302
The way he was before,
or after...

503
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,404
You turned him
into a monster?

504
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,806
- Julia, he turned on me.
- It's always all about you.

505
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:25,109
Here we are...

506
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,612
Mourning my beautiful
little Marcus.

507
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:31,449
No body, no grave, no priest.

508
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,020
This is what your crimes
have done for him.

509
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,989
- It's as if he never existed.
- He exists in my heart.

510
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,358
You don't have a heart.

511
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,259
You had one once.

512
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:46,263
But it's been eaten away
by darkness.

513
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,699
- [Canton] Sloan.
- [Julia]
This is a funeral!

514
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:53,504
Honey, I'll be right back.
Wait. Please wait.

515
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:00,110
[Julia]
Oh, God.

516
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,112
[Sloan]
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

517
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,250
We got a problem.
What is it?

518
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,285
That surviving detective,
Morgan...

519
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:11,222
He I.D.'d your son.
I want Ray Morgan dead.

520
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,258
Sloan.

521
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:16,593
I wasn't happy
with you hittin' Chang
at the station.

522
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,964
Gives us cops
a bad name.

523
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,234
That's too fuckin' bad.
Take a walk.

524
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:39,484
- Daddy!
- Dad!

525
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:45,056
Daddy!
Hey, guys.
How ya doin'?

526
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:47,058
Good.
When'd you get here?

527
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,060
Dad got home
late last night.

528
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:53,330
- We have to let him rest.
- No, I'm fine. What do
you guys want to do today?

529
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,166
Swimming!
Horseback riding.

530
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,503
Okay, how about we swim today
and horseback ride tomorrow?

531
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,370
Mm-mmm.
Fine.

532
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,940
- What do you say, Mom?
- Sounds good.

533
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,011
I missed you guys.

534
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:09,179
Yeah.
I missed you too, Dad.

535
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:13,851
Why did Elaine
and Lucas go back?

536
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,885
Because nobody's
after them,

537
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,757
And as far as anybody knows,
Lucas doesn't know
about Sloan,

538
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:23,893
So he can head up
the investigation
until I get back.

539
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,297
Well, I hope
that's not too soon.

540
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,334
I kind of like
having you around.

541
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,769
Oh, you do, huh?
Yes, I do.

542
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:34,139
I really do.

543
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,324
[Michelle]
Daddy, I wanna go
to the mountains.

544
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,261
[Jeremy]
Too bad.
We're goin' to the desert.

545
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,395
[Tina]
You're both right.

546
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,066
We have to go
through the mountains
to get to the desert.

547
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,000
[Morgan]
We're almost there, guys.

548
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,403
[Tina]
It was so great to see Elaine
and Lucas, wasn't it?

549
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:08,906
Uh...

550
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,141
We have to do it more often.

551
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,244
We will.
Promise?

552
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:16,481
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I promise.

00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,981
It's gonna be fine.
[Horn Honking]

Daddy!

569
00:52:38,723 --> 00:52:40,758
Come on, man.
My father's not gonna like this.

570
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:44,229
Morgan's mine.
I'm gonna get that bastard.

00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,864
Oh, I can't watch!

578
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,768
Hold my hand.
Don't let go.

579
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,477

[Tina]
No!

582
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:16,714
My God.
There were children
in that car.

[Chuckles]

584
00:55:19,216 --> 00:55:21,318
Whatever.

585
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:27,657
Let's get out of here.

586
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:34,064
[Lucas]
Ray.

587
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:36,199
Can you hear me?
Ray.

588
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:38,768
He's still comatose,
Detective Cassidy.

589
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,671
But he could still hear me.
That's what you told me
yesterday.

590
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,807
Yes, it is a possibility.

591
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:49,380
Father...
His eyes are moving.

592
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:51,681
[Priest]
Thank the Lord.

593
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:59,222
Ray, it's Lucas.

594
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:01,459
Ray.
He should be
in the hospital.

595
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:03,360
You should not have
taken him from them.

596
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,696
If I would have left him,
he would have been killed.

597
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:15,339
Lucas.

598
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,507
Thought we lost you
a dozen times.

599
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,576
Been in a coma a week.

600
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:24,482
- Where am I?
- In the Holy Innocence
Mission.

601
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,917
[Lucas]
This is Father Navarro.

602
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,852
He used to be a doctor.

603
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,961
[Morgan Exhales]
They put a tracking device
on your car, Ray.

604
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,430
They knew where you were.

605
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:41,999
They took you to the hospital
after the crash.

606
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,502
But I knew Sloan
would find you there,

607
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:46,703
So I brought you here.

608
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,975
Lucas, the crash...

609
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:54,679
Tina and the kids...
Where are they?

610
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:11,929
[Whispering]
I'm sorry, man.

611
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:14,899
[Sobs]

612
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,979
[Sobbing]

613
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,120
No.

614
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,226
[Brown]
We still can't find Morgan.

615
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:45,695
Must be Cassidy, his partner,
who's also missing.

616
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,864
Cassidy must have slipped him
out of the hospital.

617
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,767
What the hell
am I paying you for?
He must be missing a week.

618
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,103
Nobody could have survived
that crash, Mr. Sloan.

619
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,039
Morgan did.

620
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:57,273
But you managed to kill
his wife and kids.

621
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,375
I strictly forbid that.

622
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:03,113
- It was unavoidable.
- Never have I been responsible
for killin' a kid.

623
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,851
Never.
Now get the fuck
out of my face.

624
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,462
Pop.

625
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:20,930
Nicky.

626
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,594
You here to stop me,
Father?

627
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,196
You have to stop yourself,
my son.

628
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:57,266
All I see is darkness.

629
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,368
All I feel is despair...

630
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,305
And hate.

631
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:05,308
Every man must choose
his own path, Ray Morgan.

632
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,544
Turn to God.

633
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:10,547
Ask him to show you
your path.

634
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:14,751
He will wait
until you are ready.

635
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,932
[Sobbing]

636
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,427
Ray?

637
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,365
We've already spoken,
Father.

638
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,600
Your friend Lucas
is here.

639
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,605
I fear
for your soul, son.

640
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:11,241
My soul?

641
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,810
I've lost my soul.

642
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,946
No soul is empty, Ray.

643
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:22,286
For two months I have
seen pain and hatred
eat you alive.

644
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:27,191
Pain will give way
to healing.

645
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:32,129
And hatred can give way
to forgiveness,

646
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34,164
If you allow it.

647
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,166
Ray.

648
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,135
Let's walk.

649
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:47,778
I will keep
the candles lit
for your family.

650
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,980
Thank you, Father.

651
01:00:52,717 --> 01:00:54,919
And for you.

652
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,660
[Bells Chiming]

653
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,829
[Lucas]
Been hiding out
since the accident,

654
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:07,865
But I'm going back to town.

655
01:01:07,932 --> 01:01:10,300
Elaine's in Corona,
at her aunt's house.

656
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:14,103
I have an apartment downtown
under an assumed name.

657
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,939
Here's the number.

658
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,975
Call me if you need me.

659
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,911
Otherwise,
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

660
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:26,216
Ray. We can bring Sloan down...
If we're smart.

661
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:29,953
I'll call Trent.
Assume everybody else
is dirty.

662
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:35,124
Watch your back,
partner.
Okay.

663
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,056
[Laughing]

664
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:46,964
They tell me you haven't eaten
in three days.

665
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:50,968
Has Lucas called?

666
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:54,038
You know I would tell you
right away if he did.

667
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,283

668
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:11,555
[Ringing]

669
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:17,460
Hello.
Elaine?
Is that you?

670
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,729
- Ray.
- You shouldn't be there,
Elaine.

671
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,334
- Where's Lucas?
- [Choking]
Ray...

672
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,336
Ray, Lucas...

673
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,206
