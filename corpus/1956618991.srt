01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,173
- We prayed for protection.

1242
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,088
- Praying won't protect you

1243
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:51,829
from what's about
to take place here,

1244
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:53,874
and that Bible won't stop
a piece of hot lead.

1245
01:11:54,005 --> 01:11:56,050
- We are not leaving.

1246
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:00,141
[Horse whinnying]

1247
01:12:18,986 --> 01:12:21,554
- You people ready to vacate
colonel cusack's land?

1248
01:12:21,815 --> 01:12:23,382
- It's not his land!

1249
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:26,342
- He holds the deed,
legal and proper.

1250
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:27,952
- You know we paid him for it.

1251
01:12:28,082 --> 01:12:30,911
- Either you pack up
and leave,

1252
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:34,001
or my men will shoot you down

1253
01:12:34,132 --> 01:12:38,571
until each and every one
of you trespassers is dead.

1254
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:40,007
Do I make myself clear?

1255
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:46,971
- Aah!
[Men murmuring]

1256
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:48,538
[Horse whinnies]
- You all right?

1257
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:52,542
- You, sir,

1258
01:12:52,672 --> 01:12:54,544
are the trespassers!

1259
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:56,328
Get off our land!

1260
01:12:59,026 --> 01:13:00,419
- Get ready to fire, men.

1261
01:13:02,116 --> 01:13:04,380
[Cocks gun]
This is your last warnin'.

1262
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,382
- Gonna blow them up,
too, Quinn?

1263
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:14,215
You're very good at blowin' up
women and children,

1264
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:15,913
shootin' unarmed men.

1265
01:13:16,043 --> 01:13:19,830
These people don't care for
guns being used on their land.

1266
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,440
I'd hate to upset them.

1267
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,747
- Makes me no never mind
what they care for.

1268
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,582
- I'm not gonna let you
kill these people.

1269
01:13:34,192 --> 01:13:35,628
Not this time.

1270
01:13:37,195 --> 01:13:38,283
- You're him.

1271
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,112
Preacher.

1272
01:13:41,242 --> 01:13:43,723
Preacher from the church.
I knew I'd seen you before.

1273
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:46,465
- Go on, child killer.

1274
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:55,300
- Uhh!
[Horses whinnying]

1275
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:06,616
- Who's next?

1276
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:10,097
One of you shoots,
and I promise...

1277
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:11,838
All of you will die.

1278
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:23,633
- I suspect
you're all decent men

1279
01:14:23,894 --> 01:14:25,286
who were led astray.

1280
01:14:30,335 --> 01:14:33,077
- This ain't our fight, boys.
Let's go.

1281
01:14:53,445 --> 01:14:55,926
- You knew him from somewhere.

1282
01:14:56,056 --> 01:14:59,669
- I apologize for killing him
on your land.

1283
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:01,671
- That'll be the end of it.
We thank you.

1284
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:04,021
- There's one more matter
before it's over.

1285
01:15:04,151 --> 01:15:05,718
- Can we be of help, brother?

1286
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:07,285
- Just finish buildin'
that church.

1287
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:36,793
- Hold it right there.

1288
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:39,535
- Quinn told me the colonel
wanted to see me.

1289
01:15:39,839 --> 01:15:40,623
- Wait here.

1290
01:15:40,884 --> 01:15:42,581
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

1291
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:51,895
[Door opens]

1292
01:15:56,856 --> 01:15:59,250
- Ah. The bounty hunter.

1293
01:16:02,427 --> 01:16:04,472
I was expecting somebody else.

1294
01:16:11,697 --> 01:16:14,134
May I assume that sheriff Quinn
is no longer with us?

1295
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:15,962
- You may.

1296
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:17,529
- May I also assume...

1297
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,576
That my men outside
are indisposed?

1298
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,751
I see.

1299
01:16:22,055 --> 01:16:22,665
Well...

1300
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:24,928
Cognac?

1301
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:28,148
Oh, that's right. You, uh,

1302
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:29,367
you don't care for cognac.

1303
01:16:29,497 --> 01:16:31,761
[Liquid pouring]
Well...

1304
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:35,155
Well.

1305
01:16:35,286 --> 01:16:36,200
To your health.

1306
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:40,987
Ahh.

1307
01:16:41,118 --> 01:16:43,076
Are you gonna kill me?

1308
01:16:43,207 --> 01:16:45,426
I mean, I don't think
I have a bounty on my head.

1309
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:47,167
- There should be.

1310
01:16:47,298 --> 01:16:50,997
- What is this, some form of--
of revenge? A vendetta?

1311
01:16:51,128 --> 01:16:52,390
- It's about justice.

1312
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,393
- I am
an unusually persuasive man.

1313
01:16:55,523 --> 01:16:57,221
Now, perhaps I could
change your mind.

1314
01:16:57,351 --> 01:16:58,439
- Write out a bill of sale

1315
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,180
for that land
you sold to settlers.

1316
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:00,964
- [Chuckles]

1317
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,490
[Cocks gun]
- Right...Now.

1318
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:15,848
- Do you really think
what's taken place here

1319
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:19,678
is gonna stop
when you kill me?

1320
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:21,332
The stakes are too great.

1321
01:17:24,335 --> 01:17:25,641
[Sighs]

1322
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:27,817
And if not me,

1323
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:30,646
there are other greedy men,
just as hungry.

1324
01:17:36,564 --> 01:17:37,783
- Never said I came here
to kill you.

1325
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,743
- What? You're just
gonna walk away?

1326
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:45,704
Uhh!

1327
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:52,276
- Welcome to hell, colonel.

1328
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:01,981
[Horse nickers]

1329
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:28,921
[Horse nickers]

1330
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:40,716
- You're late.
