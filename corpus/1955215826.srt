1
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,520
I do not want to be weak.

2
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,760
Not having the strength to stand up
and touch my feet above the ground.

3
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,280
I do not want to be morbid.

4
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,040
I'm most afraid of.

5
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,800
Life seeps out of me
like steam from a locomotive.

6
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,720
Wheels moving so slowly.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Until they finally stops spinning at all.

8
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,040
It's hard to think of something that lasts forever
, which continues without end.

9
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,520
But love...
I know that love is endless.

10
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,080
I will love after death.
As my mother still loves me.

11
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,760
- Up, Alice. You're going to school today.
- I do not want to go to school.

12
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,640
We have just moved here. Do you want to acquire
new friends, you have to go to school.

13
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,800
You have to go to school every day.
You know that.

14
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,080
You must walk today, and the next day, and the next
. It will not escape.

15
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,160
Catholic !

16
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,600
My dad says that
you are whores of Babylon!

17
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,760
Hush!
Translation: gengmovie.com

18
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,000
I do not ask again.

19
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,600
The tags Queen.

20
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,840
Who did this?

21
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,240
Who did this?

22
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If we are going to heaven when we die,
we will return to earth...

23
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,520
-... And see what the future holds?
- No.

24
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,000
Do not know if I want to get stuck in the sky
and never see the sea and the forest again.

25
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,960
You do not see them
if you are in heaven.

26
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,880
- Why not?
- Do not know. But you do not.

27
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,160
- Angels will not return from the sky?
- There are angels. But you are not one.

28
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,680
Far from it. Maybe you could answer the question
if you pay attention in school.

29
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm as good a student as the other.
I just daydreaming.

30
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,560
Your dreams will give you
problems. Father pays your private school.

31
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,440
- You could at least learn something.
- It's summer now.

32
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,680
I want to forget about school and come
remember what it's like to sit in the sun.

33
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,600
Sure. Do as you want.
As usual.

34
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,080
- Do you think we've been here long enough?
- For what?

35
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,600
We moved here a few months ago
and I have not met anyone yet.

36
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,160
- Except my classmates.
- I can just hang out with the church.

37
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,880
Protestants like us
not at all and they are many more than we do.

38
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,320
Was it because the boy yelled at me
on the way to school yesterday?

39
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,680
Father McAvoy talked about
radical ideas and new ways to have old traditions.

40
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,960
And how we would not let
the insane become the förnuftiga-

41
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,720
- Or lie become the truth.
But I want to meet new people.

42
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,680
I want to hear new ideas and
meet the strange and eccentric.

43
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,560
I want to meet the people who
change the world, to those seen in movies.

44
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,040
- You would not have to go to the cinema.
- We might not have been here long enough.

45
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,960
Let's see, we've been here...
three months.

46
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,880
So, yes, it is time that you hit
new and exciting people.

47
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,920
- Are you patronizing towards me?
- What?

48
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,160
- Condescending. That means...
- I know what it means.

49
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,680
- Are you patronizing towards me?
- Of course not.

50
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,960
- Or maybe a little.
- Well then.

51
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,400
When would you like some tea?
I am tired of the condescending treatment.

52
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,920
If for a moment. You can brew it myself
if you want. The drums are in the basket.

53
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,960
- Where is my teacup?
- How should I know, Alice?

54
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,280
It's not here.
It must be left somewhere.

55
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,040
Perhaps the home. I'll get it.

56
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,080
- I said I'll get it.
- Do what you must.

57
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,440
In the golden afternoon
we slide off the front

58
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,720
- For small hands usually
cleverly our oars.

59
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,400
While little hands in vain
pretend to guide us.

60
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,800
Ah, cruel Three!
At such time, the dreamy weather

61
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,120
- To tell about breathing
so weak that the slightest spring not sway.

62
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,520
What can a lonely voice
against the three conspirators tongues?

63
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,200
Mighty Prima flashes his edict
"to initiate it."

64
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,480
In milder tones hope Secunda;
"It is not to mean."

65
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,440
While Tertia interrupts only
story once every minute.

66
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,840
Oh no, I'm late! I must go.
Goodbye, Miss. I'm too late.

67
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,560
Anon, to sudden silence won.
In the imagination seeking the dream child.

68
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,360
On the way through the country with the,
wild and new.

69
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Wait, sir! What's your name?

70
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,400
And when history wiped out
imagination källor-

71
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,200
- And slightly strained
that the substance put away.

72
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,800
Can you stop and say who you are?

73
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,360
"Vila next time..."
"Next time is now", happy voices shouted!

74
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,440
Sir, I beg you to stay!
Can you stay?

75
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,280
Oh dear, I can not place where.

76
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,520
What are you talking about?
Of course, you can not place where.

77
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,320
It is a rabbit hole.

78
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,840
So grew the history of the country.
Slowly, one by one.

79
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Its strange events were forged,
and now the saga finished and homes we manage.

80
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,520
A happy bunch, during sunset.
Alice!

81
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,800
Have a fairy tale and put it with gentle
place where childhood dreams tvinnas-

82
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,000
- In memory mysterious band,
as pilgrims withered flowers-

83
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,520
-plockade In remote country.

84
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,920
Drink Me.

85
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,800
Wow, so strange everything is today.
And yesterday everything seemed normal.

86
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,880
I wonder if I changed person during the night?
Let me think.

87
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,720
I felt like the same
When I woke up this morning?

88
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,360
I think I felt a little different.

89
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,960
But if I'm not the same,
Who in the world am I?

90
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,760
I'm not Ada,
for her hair is curly.

91
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,600
I have no attracts all.

92
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,280
I can not be Mabel,
because I know a lot of things.

93
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,960
And she knows so very little.

94
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,960
And besides, she's she, and I'm me.

95
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,080
Everything is so confusing.

96
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,720
I must have been changed to Mabel.
I have to stay in that narrow house-

97
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,800
- And hardly have any friends
and have so much I have to learn.

98
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,280
No. I have decided.

99
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,600
If I'm Mabel, I stop down here.

100
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,640
It will do no good if they protrude
their heads and say "come up again."

101
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,040
I just look up and say:
"Who am I?"

102
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,120
"Say it, and I like to be that person
I come up."

103
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,960
"If not, I'll stay down here
until I'm somebody else."

104
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:05,120
I wish they look in here.
I'm so tired of being alone.

105
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,880
The loneliness is strange.

106
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,360
On the one hand, the solitude be
a terrible cross to bear.

107
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,240
That leaves someone in a lasting
state of isolation and independence.

108
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,360
On the other hand, solitude us
chance to explore our thoughts.

109
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,080
What have you thought about, Alice?

110
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,640
- I think I'll go now.
- Do you?

111
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,920
Nothing to be afraid of, Alice.

112
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,240
You've met my brother?
The man with the white shoes.

113
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,960
He has led you very far down.

114
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,040
Some of us should be down here.

115
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,440
And some will not!

116
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,000
I think it's time for you
to go back, Alice.

117
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,920
- Take my hand.
- I do not want to.

118
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,720
We do not always get what we want!

119
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,280
Sit down, everyone.

120
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,680
I'll soon have dried up.

121
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
You look all set out.

122
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,680
This is the driest I know.
Be silent all of us now.

123
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,760
William the Conqueror,
whose cause was supported by påven-

124
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,520
- And Englishmen,
in need of leaders, subject signal

125
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,960
- As they recently had been subjected
too many intrusions and conquests.

126
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,120
Edwin and Morcar,
earls of Mercia and Northumbria...

127
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,520
- Excuse me? Did you speak?
- Not me.

128
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,880
I thought you did it.

129
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,400
I continue.
Translation: gengmovie.com

130
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,480
Edwin and Morcar,
earls of Mercia and Northumbria-

131
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,360
-stödde Him and even Stigand-

132
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,800
- The
patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it wise...

133
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,560
- "Found it?"
- Found it. Of course.

134
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,800
- Do you know what that means?
- I know that.

135
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:44,920
When I find something, it is usually a
pretty girl or a nice bottle of booze.

136
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,400
The question is, what did the archbishop?

137
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,640
William behaved calmly first.

138
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,560
But his standard anders insolence...

139
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,640
How are you, darling?

140
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm as wet.
This dries me.

141
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,520
When I suggest that the meeting be adjourned
for immediate adoption...

142
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,640
-... Of more energetic remedies.
- Speak English!

143
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,600
I do not understand half of those
long words and it does not either.

144
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,800
What I meant to say is that the best
drying way is a political contest.

145
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,600
What is it?

146
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,520
A sort of exercise, but the best way to explain
is to do it.

147
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,680
Lost?

148
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,200
- You scared me when you're sitting in the tree.
- It was not the answer to my question.

149
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,040
Lost? Are you lost?

150
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,800
I do not really know.

151
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,120
You have to be on your way somewhere to
be lost, and I'm not going anywhere.

152
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,800
You're a fool?
My brothers must think you are lost.

153
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:12,240
Brothers? You mean he
white shoes and the horrible man with a wool coat?

154
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,160
One and the same, they and me.

155
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,800
You will realize that down here
we are all one and the same.

156
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,360
What do you mean?

157
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,040
Wait! Came back.
Tell me where I should go from here.

158
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,680
I would try opium den.

159
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,720
Fire.

160
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,320
Who are you?

161
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,280
I do not know, sir.

162
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,440
I knew who I was
When I woke up this morning.

163
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,320
But I think I have changed
several times since.

164
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,760
What do you mean by that?
Explain yourself.

165
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,760
I can not explain myself,
because I'm not myself.

166
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,160
- I do not understand.
- I can not express myself clearly.

167
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
I do not understand it myself.

168
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,320
It's very disconcerting to be
so many sizes in a day.

169
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,840
It is not.

170
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,480
You may not have...

171
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,680
You may not have thought so yet.
But when you die, and that makes you one day

172
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:31,520
- Are you dressed, laid in a small box
and buried in the ground and the earth.

173
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:37,680
- It will come to feel strange?
- Not at all.

174
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,120
You may feel differently,
but for me it would be very strange.

175
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:49,040
You. Who are you?

176
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,120
- Should not you say who you are first?
- Why?

177
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,320
Wait.

178
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,840
Come back.
I have something important to say.

179
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,560
- Master...... your mood.
- Is that all?

180
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,200
No.

181
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,160
So...

182
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,600
- You think you've changed?
- I'm afraid so.

183
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,160
- I do not remember what I used to remember.
- Can not remember what?

184
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,120
I can not remember where I came from,
or how I actually came here.

185
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,640
It's not quite right.

186
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:14,640
- How much would you be?
- Slightly older would have been nice.

187
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,480
I would not be quite so young.

188
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,680
One side will make you taller.

189
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,560
On the other hand,
make you less.

190
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,320
Fungi...
Translation: gengmovie.com

191
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Mommy loves you.

192
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,600
- We take all the people.
- What should we have for the kind of tea?

193
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,800
- French tea.
- French tea. Then we'll take the teacups.

194
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,200
Teatime.

195
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,080
- What's her name?
- Alice.

196
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,760
- Like you?
- She's in the country.

197
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,160
Your hair is so long.

198
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,880
- For my shoulders.
- Please sit still.

199
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,760
Then we wrap around this.
Hold it there.

200
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,880
Now we will take it through here.

201
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,880
About to hit, right?

202
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,040
- Hello again!
- You!

203
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,640
- Lost yet?
- I'm afraid so.

204
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,440
- So you've found somewhere to go?
- Yes. I want to go to the garden.

205
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,640
- The behind the little door?
- No garden. Never heard of it.

206
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,560
- You're lying!
- No!

207
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:36,040
- I do not know what you are talking about.
- Do you know someone who can point out the right direction?

208
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,120
A garden would be in the city,
so you can ask the doctor, or the painter.

209
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,080
- Ask anyone you want. Both are mad.
- I do not want to go among mad.

210
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,840
You've no choice?
We're all mad here.

211
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,600
Wait! Stop! Can you say
was the doctor and the painter is?

212
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,720
That way. I like how it looks that way.

213
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,520
- You know nothing at all!
- Neither are you, stupid little girl.

214
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,840
That way...

215
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:25,880
So I looked at the prostitutes
and she said to me: "I'm a man!"

216
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,560
- No place.
- No room!

217
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,160
What are you talking about? Certainly there is room.
And I miss a good tea.

218
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,800
- This is not a tea party.
- What do you drink then?

219
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,880
- Cough medicine.
- Do you cough?

220
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,160
Yes.

221
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,320
- It's medicine.
- Actual.

222
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,800
- Take some wine.
- I see no wine.

223
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,640
- There's nothing.
- Not kind to offer it.

224
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,800
Not nice of you to
sit without invitation.

225
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,880
- Is that your paintings?
- No, my.

226
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,960
I am a painter and he is my doctor.

227
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,400
- Your hair needs to be cut.
- You should not say personal things.

228
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,360
- Very rude.
- Tea, Doctor.

229
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,240
I have never learned
what is rude and not.

230
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,560
There's a fly in my cup.
Change locations!

231
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,480
Change places.

232
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,320
- What was your name again?
- Alice.

233
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,280
I like it.

234
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,040
I like it. Tell me, Alice.

235
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,600
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- I like riddles. Let's see...

236
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,960
- You can not see it. It's a mystery.
- I think I'll try to guess.

237
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,240
- Do you mean that you can find the answer?
- Exactly.

238
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,560
- Then you should say what you mean.
- I do.

239
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,400
I mean, at least what I say.
It is the same thing.

240
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,880
It's not at all the same thing.

241
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:44,360
You can say that you eat what you see
is the same as you see it you eat.

242
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,760
Or that I get what I want is the same as
I want what I get.

243
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,720
It's the same for you, doctor.

244
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,120
- Can I get some?
- No.

245
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,360
This is not for people like you.
I will not tolerate it!

246
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,520
- But it's medicine.
- Actual.

247
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,120
Is that why they call you crazy?
Because of medication?

248
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,520
They call me crazy?

249
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,640
- Switch places.
- Yes! Change places!

250
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,560
I have heard it said before.

251
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,720
So...

252
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,400
- She's as crazy as we are.
- Actual.

253
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:55,200
Terribly sorry, but it's true.
Tell me about your mother.

254
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,960
- She's dead.
- Mouse.

255
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,560
- And what day of the month is it?
- The fourth.

256
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,640
Wait, wait!
There are two days wrong again!

257
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,320
Dear. I told clockwork
would not withstand the butter.

258
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,280
It was the best butter.

259
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,840
Yes! But some crumbs must be complied with.

260
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:39,080
Then I well not stopped in the
with bread knife, right, Doc?

261
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,560
What an interesting watch.
The speaks about the date but not the time.

262
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,120
Why would it?
Speaks your watch on what year it is?

263
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,320
Of course not.
It's the same year a very long time.

264
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,840
It is the same with mine.
Do you have guessed my riddle yet?

265
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,960
- No. I give up. What is the answer?
- I have no idea.

266
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,560
I do not either.

267
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,920
You should not waste your time
with riddles you do not have answers to.

268
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,520
If you knew the time
half as well as I do-

269
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:28,040
- You would not talk about wasting
"it away." The dear lady, is he.

270
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:34,120
- I do not understand.
- You have not even met the time?

271
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,600
Perhaps not. But I have to beat
pace when I learn music.

272
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,360
There we have it!
He can not get beat.

273
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,440
You'd held up well with him.

274
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,120
Will any of you to town then?
I thought about going there.

275
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:13,920
Not me. You see,
I am barred in town.

276
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,280
The last time I was there
I sang a little song. What I sang?

277
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,120
It went something like this.

278
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:32,520
Twinkle, twinkle little bat
How I wonder what you do?

279
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,840
- You may be singing?
- I've heard something like that.

280
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:41,160
It continues, you understand.
Up above the world you fly.

281
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:46,280
As a saucer in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, blink, blink.

282
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,640
Twinkle, twinkle, blink, blink.

283
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,640
I had barely
through the first verse before a police shouting:

284
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,600
"Hey, stop him!"
"He's madder than a hatter!"

285
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,400
- So terribly cruel.
- It was.

286
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,160
- Were you arrested?
- I?

287
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,600
Of course not!
I'm here now, right?

288
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,480
Doctor?

289
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:29,280
Well, civil obedience, my lady,
is for the square.

290
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:34,200
I have always seen me
himself more like a... Cube.

291
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:39,000
You've always been a little crazy?

292
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,920
Crazy?

293
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,080
Listen.

294
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,480
When they come back
I do not follow them.

295
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,760
I just wanted you to know.

296
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:48,960
You do not know how it is there.
It is not hygienic.

297
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,520
You're not from here?

298
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,520
I can always see it.

299
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,680
You...
You are very cute, you know?

300
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,160
I know.
Translation: gengmovie.com

301
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,600
- Yes, you know it.
- I mean, please.

302
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,400
Can you...

303
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,840
I mean, can you loosen my belt?

304
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:50,160
They are so tight.
I do not feel my hands.

305
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:56,560
- I probably can not do it.
- It's very easy. Do you see?

306
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,560
Pull the strap in the back, here.

307
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,280
I feel free and feel immediately better.

308
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,040
No! No no no!

309
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,480
Time for your medicine.

310
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,160
Please, no!

311
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,800
I do not want to go back there!
It is not hygienic!

312
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:20,200
So, so.
No reason to be violent.

313
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:24,560
It's for your own good.
I am well doctor?

314
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,200
Let me take care of you.

315
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:38,160
I do not want!
I do not want to!

316
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,040
So yes. Does not it feel better now?

317
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,320
I feel much better. Thanks.

318
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:11,800
But do not tell me it's just me
who can see the girl standing over there.

319
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:19,560
One of the patients have escaped from
his room! Get her back there!

320
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,800
Hey.

321
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:47,480
- Is it your drawings?
- Yes it is.

322
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:55,760
You see, I'm the painter,
and he is my doctor.

323
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,080
Who is this?

324
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,640
It's Alice.

325
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,280
Is she very pretty?

326
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,520
Can you tell me where she went?

327
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:39,440
I can not go any further.
The doctor said I can not go anymore.

328
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,800
Tell me, where are we now?
Where is this?

329
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,840
Tea?

330
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,760
Yes, please.

331
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:59,320
Nothing beats tea
to warm the spirits.

332
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,240
Do you know what I think?

333
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,320
I think you're crazy.

334
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,920
Excuse?

335
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,000
Mad.

336
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,760
No, no, I'm not crazy.

337
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:32,520
Crazy... crazy... crazy.

338
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,800
Alice went to town,
but I will not go there anymore.

339
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,400
Good boy.

340
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,280
Change places.

341
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,320
Well, Doctor?

342
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,400
I am free.

343
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:29,040
Do not be so uptight. Why so nervous?

344
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,520
What is it? Have you lost the power of speech?

345
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:41,800
You better come in from the rain. You want
not get pneumonia or TB.

346
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,880
It was better.

347
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,000
- What's your name?
- Alice.

348
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,640
It is a beautiful name.
Where are you from, Alice?

349
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:00,920
I'm lost.
And trying to find the way out.

350
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,280
- Or up.
- Up? Yes I understand.

351
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,600
I can not help you.

352
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:13,360
I'm lost myself,
for I will not go anywhere.

353
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,320
It also means that
I can not be found.

354
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,920
- Can you at least point out the right direction?
- No, I can not help you.

355
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,440
I am the pestilential, plague,
plague, the scourge, the infected.

356
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:34,360
I suffer from the disease that is injected.
No, I can not help you.

357
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:41,400
Located in the gutter, eat garbage, drink
rain, I can not help you.

358
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,040
- Does it hurt?
- That's the problem, darling.

359
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,640
- It does not hurt at all.
- You can not go to a hospital?

360
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,960
Hospital?
I got the disease in a hospital.

361
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:08,240
The doctors and scientists working
in their labs and their petri dishes.

362
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,360
They are not interested
of us now, anyway.

363
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:16,320
Not when the real disease is raging.

364
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,600
A cure then?
You will be able to cure all diseases one day.

365
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:34,720
One day people will live
forever. Regardless of their diseases.

366
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,240
- And how do you know?
- I just know.

367
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:43,200
People can still create good things. Big things.

368
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,160
If you want to see something good
may want to start here.

369
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:53,840
They seem to get ready to make
something sinister at that tree.

370
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:13,400
No point in messing with me.
I'm already dead.

371
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:20,640
But he is over there will be hung
for something he can not help.

372
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:27,280
No word from him could prevent
noose to tighten around his neck.

373
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,640
Alice.

374
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,560
You may find your help
by helping others.

375
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,720
Sin spear can not
harm the righteous.

376
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,960
The righteous can not be damaged.

377
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,560
Righteous.

378
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,960
Wait! Stop!

379
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,120
Stop!

380
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,160
So yes.

381
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,680
Do not cry.

382
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:00,080
Your tears do this much more difficult.

383
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,360
Do not be afraid, Alice.

384
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,040
We bring you home.

385
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,440
You want it?

386
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,760
You can not stay here.

387
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,560
Your presence... making a mess of things.

388
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,960
You understand well?

389
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,000
- Who is this?
- My name is Alice.

390
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,920
- But I would just go.
- Nonsense.

391
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:16,120
Where are you at this time?
Home? I do not think so.

392
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:21,720
I happen to know that you
are very far from home.

393
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:27,400
Come. You should stay here and use
your time to something useful.

394
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,080
We clean the machines on the back.

395
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,200
I'll teach you how to take apart
a gearbox.

396
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,840
We usually lock the doors when we are working.

397
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,720
It promotes... productivity.

398
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,360
Do you do me the honor?

399
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:17,640
Very well, Alice.
Give it back to me now.

400
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:51,080
No more pain! No more pain!

401
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,600
No more pain!

402
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:17,960
No more pain! No more pain!

403
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,320
Scatter.
Scatter and go home.

404
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:26,400
Factories like this should not exist.

405
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:31,600
- You must take into fists if we should go.
- As you wish.

406
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,960
Cut off her head!

407
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,840
Alice, wake up!
Wake up, Alice. Are you okay?

408
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:23,240
- Thank God.
- I had a strange dream.

409
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,760
A dream?

410
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,920
It was a rabbit and a man.
And then I fell.

411
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,800
I fell far down,
and on the ground crying I-

412
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,080
- Because I did not remember who I was
and could not get out.

413
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:41,080
- I almost drowned in my tears.
- Alice, this is madness!

414
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:45,400
Come now, it's time to go.
Gather your things go.

415
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:49,240
You want to tell me
the father of your adventures?

416
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:54,520
No. I keeps it enough
myself. For a while, anyway.

417
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,280
Good. We do not want the father suspicious.

418
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:01,240
Or maybe he wants to know.
Wait, what?

419
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:07,200
None. I said he probably is not
interested in your stories anyway.

420
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,720
Now we must go. It's very late.

421
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,680
You have had enough of adventure for a day
and I was sufficiently frightened.

422
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,160
Not again, Alice!

423
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,133
