1
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:23,494
Are you guys ready? Roll camera.

2
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:28,686
Lisanne, 32A, magazine editor.

3
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:32,691
- You want the bra off, too?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,912
You're not showing my face, are you?

5
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:39,396
Okay, because I would die
if anyone knew I was doing this.

6
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:41,859
Hold on.

7
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:48,123
There! There you have it.
What do you want me to say?

8
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:51,258
How do you feel about your breasts?

9
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,921
How do I feel about my breasts?

10
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:56,566
How would you feel about them?

11
00:00:56,667 --> 00:01:01,518
I've gone to the dentist and had tools
laid on my chest as though it was a tray.

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,189
As though it was a totally flat place
upon which a person can...

13
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:09,314
unthinkingly lay their things
and get them later.

14
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:14,630
I know you don't like it that I'm getting
the operation because you're feminists.

15
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:17,154
We're not trying to make
any judgments here.

16
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:21,078
Okay. Good, because I don't care
if you did. I would just say, "Kiss my ass."

17
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:24,117
I'm doing this for me
and I don't care what anybody says.

18
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,130
I wanna have big tits.

19
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,864
We now transmit you direct
to the laboratory of Captain Z-Ro.

20
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:36,457
Please stand by.

21
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:42,660
All right, Roger, set the location
and activate the view screen.

22
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:52,511
There you are, Jet:

23
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:55,989
The Great Pyramids of Egypt,
nearly 4,000 years old.

24
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:58,194
How does he do it?

25
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:01,143
Okay, Roger,
move to the chair and sit down.

26
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,006
- Stand by to activate the time machine.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:14,406
Set it for the year 2000 BC.

28
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:18,116
Bring up the voltage to one million.

29
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:21,113
Thermo gauge: 40.5.
Stand by to activate the reactor.

30
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:22,263
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:27,257
- Petro?
- Yes, Captain.

32
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:32,077
Stand by to operate the time machine.
Set it at 991.875.

33
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,483
That's awfully high.
Where in the world are you going?

34
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:40,201
Back to the Great Pyramid of Giza,
in the year 2000 BC.

35
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:42,537
- Stand by for signals.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:48,830
I'm separating the alveolus
from the vomer.

37
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:50,551
What do I need?

38
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,886
- You would need the...
- No, Steve.

39
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:53,974
Kevin?

40
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:56,794
- Kevin?
- Sir?

41
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:00,467
Never mind.

42
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:03,345
That's all right.
Go back to what you were doing.

43
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,969
It's peculiar...

44
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:09,550
I have this 12-year-old boy here,
we've got an aponeurosis of the velum.

45
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:14,757
Since he's here at this operating room,
why don't we give him some of that...

46
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,439
What do you call it? Medical attention.

47
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,675
- Aufricht retractor?
- Today!

48
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,958
- What's that?
- What is what?

49
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,314
- What's that you're holding?
- An aufricht retractor.

50
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:31,443
- Really?
- I made some modifications to it.

51
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:35,051
I integrated a spring-tension device
that makes it easier...

52
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,775
An aufricht retractor, you idiot!

53
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,940
A real aufricht retractor!

54
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,187
Aufricht retractor.

55
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,455
Thank you.

56
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:48,219
Did I ask you to modify it? Did I?

57
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:52,701
No, I told you to fetch it, you moron.

58
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:57,052
Asshole!

59
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:00,566
- Watch your language.
- What a degrading sadist!

60
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:04,688
That's it. After my rotation,
I'm out of here. I'm going to Thoracics.

61
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:07,306
Do you have any idea
what Debakey's doing over there?

62
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,579
He's building an artificial heart.

63
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:12,807
Yeah, an artificial heart!
Debakey has 28 patents to his name.

64
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:17,277
How many does Larson have?
None. Zero patents, the bastard!

65
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,756
Watch your mouth!

66
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:22,647
Debakey doesn't treat his people like this.
He treats his people like people...

67
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:25,467
as evidenced
by not being such an asshole.

68
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:29,808
May I have a word with you?

69
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:38,504
As a figure of authority and as a mentor...

70
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:42,178
I've come to tolerate an amount
of ignorant disdain from my residents.

71
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,198
About what I said...

72
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:48,028
But I expect, if not the real thing,
at least a pretense of grudging respect.

73
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:52,481
- I didn't mean it. All right, Dr. Larson?
- I had some very high hopes in you.

74
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,550
I thought I could teach you something.

75
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:57,783
I shouldn't have done it during surgery,
but with my adjustments...

76
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:00,238
I thought I could make a difference.

77
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:04,400
You wanna move over to Thoracics?
You wanna swagger in the limelight.

78
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,249
The artificial heart, the fancy building,
and so forth?

79
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:08,872
That's not it.

80
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:11,594
It ain't enough
to give a boy back his smile.

81
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:13,383
They saved his life.

82
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:17,441
What's it matter if he spends it in a closet
with a bag over his head?

83
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:20,572
- They call us beauticians.
- What?

84
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,831
Plastic surgeons, they call us beauticians.

85
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:27,891
- Who does?
- Everybody does.

86
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:36,239
- You mean residents?
- Residents, nurses, doctors, everybody.

87
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:39,021
- Are you gonna fire me?
- No.

88
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:44,171
In what context
do they call us beauticians?

89
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:47,042
I don't know. It's just a joke, I guess.

90
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,851
- I thought you knew about it.
- Beauticians like a woman hairdresser?

91
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,087
Or like some goddamn nail painter?

92
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:54,714
I don't know what they mean.

93
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:57,432
- Hi, Dave, Louis.
- Hello, Bill.

94
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:06,571
- Listen, about what I said in there...
- Forget it.

95
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,331
I'll want to remove those walls.

96
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:12,513
- The kitchen, too small.
- Too small?

97
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:14,920
You cannot cook in this kitchen.

98
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:18,786
- What about a French window there?
- French windows.

99
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:21,028
That's a great idea.

100
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:22,785
I like that.

101
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,040
Come on in
and look at Patrice's new drawings.

102
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:35,571
Sure, honey.

103
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:41,134
I think I'll take a look at them as soon
as you figure out how to pay for them.

104
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,182
Actually, I have plans tonight.

105
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,723
How about some other time this week?

106
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:59,345
Actually, I'm gonna be busy all week.
But maybe some time after that?

107
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,673
Okay. That sounds great.

108
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,874
- Okay.
- Okay.

109
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,318
Goodbye.

110
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:11,210
- Who was that?
- That was Kevin.

111
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:12,866
Kevin Saunders?

112
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:14,500
Yeah.

113
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:16,445
What did he want?

114
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:19,006
He wanted a date.

115
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,785
Hi, Kevin.

116
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:32,434
Look at this. Look at that.

117
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,095
It's a padded bra.

118
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:36,876
And this. Hold on.

119
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,482
"The Pump." Look at how that works.

120
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,104
And it's "doctor recommended."

121
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:46,591
Just hold on. And creams.

122
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:50,181
"Breast Enhancement Cream.
It will be our little secret."

123
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:52,002
I gotta make my rounds.

124
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,919
Would you just hear me out?

125
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:56,190
You're healing very nicely.

126
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:59,897
- Why? Just give me one reason...
- I'll have a nurse change that bandage.

127
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:05,037
All I'm saying is this could open up
a whole new world of medicine.

128
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,697
- What, breasts?
- Why not?

129
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:12,653
If Debakey can build a better heart,
why can't we build a better breast?

130
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,919
George, are you all right?

131
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:19,676
I'm okay, Spinner.

132
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,984
Hello, Raquel!

133
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,318
Hello, Dr. Larson.

134
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,250
- How are you?
- Pretty good. How you doing today?

135
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:29,561
Pretty good.

136
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,938
- This is Dr. Saunders.
- Hello.

137
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,914
Would you mind
showing him your breasts, please?

138
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:40,741
Raquel had polyvinyl Ivalon sponges
implanted in 1959.

139
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:44,896
What happened?

140
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:48,483
The porous sponges encouraged
fibrous tissue to grow into them.

141
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:49,924
We're taking them out tomorrow.

142
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,046
We're concerned the polyvinyl
releases carcinogens as it breaks down.

143
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,848
That stuff belongs in automobile seats,
not people.

144
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,721
They were real nice for six months.

145
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:06,003
- Thank you, Raquel.
- Sure.

146
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,645
They don't teach it in medical school...

147
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:14,378
but there have been plenty of doctors
who've tried everything from paraffin to...

148
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:17,637
glass balls in an attempt
to make bigger breasts.

149
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,162
They were successful in maiming.

150
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,422
They were excellent at disfiguring
and killing their patients.

151
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:25,211
But, on the whole...

152
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:29,973
I think you'd have to say the results
were pretty terribly mixed.

153
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:36,144
Terri, 34A, dental hygienist.

154
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:39,470
That little snap of the bra clasp opening...

155
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,819
which to the guy, I assume,
represents some rush of erotic victory.

156
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,987
A sound which should be a happy sound...

157
00:09:46,443 --> 00:09:49,666
creates in me a feeling
of horror and panic so acute...

158
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,554
I have an impulse to scream.

159
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,329
What's so funny?

160
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:57,716
I'm sorry. It's just the way you said that,
it was funny.

161
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:02,063
It wasn't so funny to me.

162
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,574
Thank you.

163
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:25,719
- I think Kennedy's really got him this time.
- Castro's gone out of his mind.

164
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,813
Last Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM...

165
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:33,619
I directed that our surveillance
be stepped up.

166
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:38,288
Having now confirmed and completed
our evaluation of the evidence...

167
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:41,290
and our decision on a course of action...

168
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:46,111
this government feels obliged to report
this new crisis to you in fullest detail.

169
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:49,574
The characteristics
of these new missile sites...

170
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,236
Hello.

171
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:12,137
I'm Dr. Saunders
from the Texas Medical Center.

172
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:17,348
Hello, Dr. Saunders
from the Texas Medical Center.

173
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,035
I know this sounds like a line...

174
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,738
but I'm working on a medical project
and I would like to enlist your help.

175
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,517
You said you were a doctor.
I thought doctors had lots of money.

176
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,715
I just finished my residency.

177
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:45,673
So you can't write prescriptions?

178
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:47,906
Why, are you sick?

179
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:58,366
- What is that?
- It's a dental alginate mold.

180
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,520
It looks like oatmeal.

181
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:06,931
Yeah, actually. But you can't eat it.

182
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:11,752
Don't worry, it washes right off the skin.

183
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:16,450
Do you wanna take off your sweater?

184
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,079
Okay...

185
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:52,830
Here, sit. Would you, please?

186
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,118
Take this towel and put it on your lap.

187
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:07,025
Okay.

188
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,437
Here we go.

189
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,030
- It's cold!
- I'm sorry.

190
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,829
Okay?

191
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:26,296
So all of these women are gonna be
walking around with my boobs?

192
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:31,606
I suppose.

193
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:37,365
Maybe after this
we can go bowling or something.

194
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:44,458
- I have this thing that I'm doing.
- Okay.

195
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:14,924
Go ahead, squeeze it.

196
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:16,548
Go ahead, just squeeze it.

197
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,841
Squeeze it, come on!

198
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:26,626
Doesn't it feel exactly like a real breast?

199
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:30,844
- How the hell would you know?
- Come on, I'm serious.

200
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:32,434
And it's safe.

201
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:37,741
Even if it broke, it's filled with salt water,
which the body can absorb harmlessly.

202
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,337
Have you thought about
what people might say?

203
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:42,599
What?

204
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,155
You're not in Chicago anymore.

205
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:49,917
A male doctor coming up with a way
to make women's breasts bigger?

206
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:51,684
I think they'd say thank you.

207
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:54,433
Think of all the women
who aren't happy with themselves...

208
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,831
or the women who've had mastectomies...

209
00:15:56,897 --> 00:16:00,374
or whose breasts have been distorted
by breastfeeding.

210
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,248
When I think of my own mother...

211
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:06,678
All right, that's enough. Just spare me.

212
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:10,919
Your mother's breasts?

213
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,963
A man can only take so much.

214
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:23,008
Over there by the bar,
they'd be over the moon if you said hello.

215
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,067
- Honey, I see them every day.
- Honey, he's a cardiologist!

216
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,146
Bye.

217
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:41,038
- What's the matter, William?
- Why, hello, Frank, Michael.

218
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:44,487
How you doing? Quite a party!
I hear they popped $10,000 on it.

219
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,795
There's Debakey,
over there by the ice heart.

220
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:48,546
How appropriate.

221
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,636
I heard he had some guy the other day
with a perfectly good heart...

222
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,644
who wanted to swap it out
for a man-made one.

223
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:57,690
Simple.

224
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:01,750
You know who that is?
That's Mitch Heilman, the astronaut.

225
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,165
- He's short.
- They're doing amazing things at NASA.

226
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:09,073
I used some of that technology
to create a simplified dialysis procedure.

227
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:12,561
My team's just come up with a new way
of mapping neurons in the brain.

228
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:16,199
They're gonna write that up
in next month's Scientific Journal.

229
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:19,073
What's new in plastic surgery?

230
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:26,877
I've developed a new aufricht retractor.

231
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,552
Did you find the old one inadequate?

232
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:48,389
Hey, Dr. Larson.

233
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,471
Anybody sitting here?

234
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,868
- No, by all means.
- Thank you.

235
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,534
The edges are sharp,
they'll irritate the tissue.

236
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:10,286
What?

237
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,328
For your breasts,
the edges will irritate the tissue.

238
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,895
An injection molding press could fix that.

239
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:24,609
- What's the shell composed of?
- A polymer mixture.

240
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:27,649
That's not gonna work.

241
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:30,134
You need an inert material.

242
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:36,183
I got a friend in Michigan
who might be able to help us with this.

243
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:39,698
Help us out? What are you saying?

244
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:43,049
I'm saying let's see if we can make it work.

245
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,687
This is Kevin Saunders
and Dr. William Larson...

246
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:50,144
the men who are going to build us
a better bosom.

247
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,053
Only one question:
How do I get on the testing committee?

248
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:04,120
Go ahead.

249
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:06,105
Open it.

250
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:12,365
I let our chemists take a look
at the prosthesis you sent...

251
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,821
and they made some modifications.

252
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:18,243
They constructed the shell membrane
out of a silicone polymer.

253
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:20,073
We're thinking of calling it the Larson.

254
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:24,290
Is that a joke?

255
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:25,827
We'll talk about it later.

256
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,801
It's all negotiable down the road.

257
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,169
You'll receive a generous royalty
of each prosthesis sold.

258
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:34,771
My lawyers handling that,
but the operative word is "generous."

259
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:36,114
What have you got in here?

260
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:40,306
It's filled with a medical-grade silicone gel,
also completely safe.

261
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:43,281
We agreed it would be filled
with saltwater solution.

262
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:47,236
We tried that but the R&D guy said
it rippled and sloshed around.

263
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,752
Silicone gel. That's the answer.

264
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:54,784
It has the same viscosity as breast tissue
and a gravity less than water.

265
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:57,700
No one will know whether
they're man-made or a gift from God!

266
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:00,379
But is it safe?

267
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:02,327
It's 100 percent safe.

268
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:06,769
We originally developed silicone for use as
an insulating material during World War II.

269
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:09,712
We couldn't even keep it
on the Navy docks in Okinawa.

270
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:12,273
Turns out the Japs
were stealing the stuff...

271
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:14,921
and injecting it directly
into women's breasts.

272
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:18,058
But they were using
industrial-grade liquid silicone.

273
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,091
There's a great deal of health risk
involved in that process.

274
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:23,712
We filled these
with medical-grade silicone gel...

275
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:28,381
and enclosed it in an indestructible,
inert, non-reactive silastic bag.

276
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:30,904
- It won't break down?
- It will not break down.

277
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:32,667
We've got the patent on silicone.

278
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:34,839
You've got something
born to be made out of it.

279
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,426
It's the perfect marriage
of industry and medicine.

280
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:39,797
Arlene, Mary Kay rep.

281
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:42,539
Can I borrow your pencil?

282
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:48,235
This is called the pencil test.
It's supposed to fall to the floor.

283
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,340
I love my children...

284
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:54,563
but I'm a little resentful about
what they did to my breasts. Thanks.

285
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,442
It's like someone blew up a balloon
and let all the air out.

286
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:02,045
Mastectomies, breastfeeding...

287
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,597
We talk as doctors...

288
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:11,124
in terms of the tangible
and the empirical...

289
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,449
but now I ask you to consider
the psychological...

290
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,465
the mental aspects
and then the opportunities that we have.

291
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:24,260
It's a low-risk operation that can be done
inexpensively and quickly...

292
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:27,168
as both a reconstruction
and an augmentation...

293
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,299
to the betterment of the...

294
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,427
overall self-esteem...

295
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:37,915
to the women who get it.

296
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,837
We can usher in
a whole new world of medicine here.

297
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:50,085
Bill.

298
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:52,896
I don't know where to start...

299
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:55,551
- If you don't mind...
- I'd like to finish.

300
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:59,032
What Dave is trying to say,
what we're all trying to say here...

301
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:03,325
is while we are touched
by your altruism...

302
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:07,509
- We're doctors and we cure people.
- We're not expensive beauticians...

303
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:09,494
who like to play with bosoms.

304
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,240
You may not understand
the despair these women endure.

305
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,152
The women...

306
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,737
If God wants a woman
to have big breasts...

307
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,106
he gives her big breasts.

308
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:23,741
That is what
we're talking about here, isn't it?

309
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,807
Does that mean
that we shouldn't correct clubfeet?

310
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:32,472
Quiet, Dave.
What I find ironic about your stupidity...

311
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:35,703
is you know what women go through
who've had this procedure done!

312
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,006
That's the irony here!

313
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,604
The fact that women have tried for so long
to increase their breast size...

314
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:44,199
that underscores...

315
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,522
you know, that this can be done safely!

316
00:22:48,974 --> 00:22:52,679
Just because you've got
some deranged fixation with breasts.

317
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,181
Once you've finished with your strippers...

318
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:00,284
and your prostitutes...

319
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:04,887
what respectable woman's
gonna pay for this?

320
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,389
I think, Louis, that if she knew...

321
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,651
how you were behaving
with some of your nurses...

322
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,925
perhaps your wife might be...

323
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,267
You wanna step outside?

324
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:23,526
Let me go, 'cause I'm gonna whip his ass!

325
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,693
- Calm down.
- We can go right there...

326
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:27,041
Calm down!

327
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,047
Dr. Larson, get out of here.

328
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,988
If you feel froggy, just jump!

329
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:36,242
Queer.

330
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:40,309
Myopic pretentious idiots.

331
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,455
What did they say?

332
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,914
Forget them.
We don't need their damned approval.

333
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,449
What happened?

334
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:49,954
You know what?
We're gonna do it without them.

335
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:52,001
How?

336
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,485
With my money.

337
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:58,172
With my money.

338
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:02,463
You just go out there
and find us the woman.

339
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:25,193
- Lola?
- Yeah?

340
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:29,793
- Are you going out?
- Yeah.

341
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,725
My associate and I...

342
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,692
we've been working on
a new medical procedure...

343
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:40,979
by which we actually increase
the size of the breast.

344
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,657
I thought you might wanna be the first.

345
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:50,121
What we do: We take a small cut,
like a small incision...

346
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:53,349
What makes you think I'd be interested
in something like that?

347
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,667
They'll be bigger.

348
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:07,411
- You're a disgusting little peeper.
- It's all right, I'm a doctor.

349
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:09,870
I thought you might ask me out,
which is bad enough.

350
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:13,137
But you wanna cut holes in me
and stick bags of goo in my chest?

351
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,855
Stay away from me, creep!

352
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:22,882
Hello.

353
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,566
Good afternoon.
I realize this may sound...

354
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:32,351
I'm with the... I'm Dr. Saunders, I'm sorry.

355
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:36,251
I'm with the Texas Medical Center
and we're working on a new procedure.

356
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,771
We increase the size of...

357
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:41,142
What we're doing is, my partner and I...

358
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:45,870
Dr. Larson, have just developed
a new technique, a medical procedure...

359
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:47,981
Hello. Excuse me.

360
00:25:49,392 --> 00:25:50,820
What a day.

361
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:53,195
Are you happy with your existing breasts?

362
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:55,175
to increase the breast.

363
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:57,125
You know how some people
wanna be first...

364
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,740
to do something?
This is your opportunity.

365
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:02,907
I don't know if you
think about your breasts.

366
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,564
It's for the breasts. I like your hat.

367
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:10,991
It's a medical procedure.

368
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:13,458
Like I said, you can be bigger.

369
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:15,919
Is that "no" as in "no questions"?

370
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,978
I'm sorry!

371
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,068
I am a doctor.

372
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:27,451
I'm with the Texas Medical Center
and we're doing a...

373
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,644
Put that disgusting thing away.

374
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,453
If you wanted to help people,
you could cure back pain or arthritis!

375
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:42,899
All right, I'm sorry.

376
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:45,482
Making women's breasts larger?

377
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,029
- I'm sorry.
- I think it's sick. I do.

378
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:52,644
I think it's very sick.
Something's wrong with you.

379
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:54,499
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,772
Put it away!

381
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,486
I'm just very disappointed.

382
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:11,990
Hey, Laura.

383
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:15,980
Can I see it?

384
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:18,827
Can I see the thing?

385
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:29,761
I mean...

386
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:36,635
For what it is, it actually looks pretty good.

387
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,925
Put it away.

388
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:46,259
Okay, I only say this to you
as a friend, but...

389
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,627
Wipe your mouth.

390
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:51,686
This whole business of this solicitation...

391
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,587
it isn't doing any wonders
for your reputation.

392
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,269
I was just sitting here...

393
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:02,646
Carrying that around and asking women,
it just comes across as perverse.

394
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,108
If you wished that
something about you was different...

395
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,214
and there was a way you could do it,
wouldn't you do it?

396
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:13,014
Possibly. It's the way that
you go about things.

397
00:28:13,848 --> 00:28:16,591
I mean, it's an appealing idea, sort of.

398
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:18,990
I'm sure there are
plenty of women out there...

399
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:21,835
who would love to have bigger breasts.

400
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:31,103
Do you want the operation?

401
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:35,317
- Is that a joke?
- No, you said it was an appealing idea.

402
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,212
- Are you insulting me?
- No.

403
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,175
I am a nurse. I am a professional.

404
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:43,404
I do not need to be insulted by you.

405
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:46,129
I was trying to be nice and help you.

406
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:56,195
Shut up.

407
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:01,092
I come from a stoic Calvinist background.

408
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:03,998
You didn't complain unless
something was drastically wrong...

409
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:06,450
like a broken leg or lung cancer.

410
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:08,340
I feel crippled.

411
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,127
I can't go to the beach.
I can't get clothes that fit.

412
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:14,005
I can't find a man. Hell, I look like a man.

413
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:17,393
Gloria Steinem says breasts
are unimportant because she's got them.

414
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:21,574
For God's sake, a surgeon doesn't buckle
when he encounters resistance.

415
00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:26,082
This isn't resistance. These women,
I'm getting anger, they hate me.

416
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:27,875
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

417
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,043
I'm Dr. Larson.

418
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:35,163
You're Miss Lindsey?

419
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:39,444
I understand you have some tattoos
you'd like removed.

420
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:42,709
Yes, right here.
My ex-husband bought them for me.

421
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:44,978
How old is the tattoo?

422
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:51,212
Eight or nine years...
It's about 10 years old.

423
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:56,294
God, they look like they haven't been
watered since I got them.

424
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,504
Pardon?

425
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,922
It's just kind of embarrassing,
'cause I've had six kids...

426
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:03,928
and they're sagging.

427
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,726
In fact, my ex-husband used to say
that I had a couple of flat feet.

428
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:10,484
Can you believe that?

429
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:14,221
What?

430
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:21,071
A transverse incision...

431
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,553
on the patient's right breast.

432
00:30:26,762 --> 00:30:30,074
- You want bigger scissors?
- Please. Thank you.

433
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:38,423
A little larger cut...

434
00:30:38,492 --> 00:30:41,620
to accommodate the implant.

435
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:43,444
Let's sponge that off.

436
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:50,287
Going through the subcutaneous tissue
to the pectoralis fascia.

437
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,585
A little suction.

438
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,888
A little bit of a bleeder here.

439
00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:57,891
Come on.

440
00:30:58,953 --> 00:31:02,209
Do some finger dissection here
to open up the pocket.

441
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:05,050
A little tight squeeze, but...

442
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:06,582
Oh, boy.

443
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:13,683
The strong use of finger dissection here...

444
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:19,468
to open up the pocket, that's used
medially, laterally and superiorly.

445
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:21,358
This is absurd! Would you excuse us?

446
00:31:21,424 --> 00:31:23,910
The implant is inserted.

447
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,232
The incision is closed bilaterally using...

448
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:30,913
a running-lock 3-0 nylon suture.

449
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:32,668
The patients are told to abstain...

450
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:35,998
from vigorous activity
for a period of three weeks.

451
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:37,499
And the result...

452
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:49,647
And the result is
a beautifully contoured breast...

453
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:53,985
with softness comparable
to that of the young adult.

454
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:59,938
The psychological well-being
of women who feel crippled...

455
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:02,558
by their own perceived shortcomings...

456
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:06,520
can be cured with one simple operation.

457
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:45,356
Are the phones working?

458
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,578
You wanna see what I've been working on?
I have an idea.

459
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,008
An idea?

460
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:19,214
Idea.

461
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:21,638
I got an idea of my own.

462
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:24,170
Let's...

463
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,725
I know, I got it.

464
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:30,397
Let's take all my money
and open up a clinic...

465
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:34,110
that no one will go to
for an operation they don't want.

466
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:37,270
Let's explore.

467
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:40,411
Let's experience like the kids are doing.

468
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,670
Let's really get into humiliation and failure.

469
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,294
Out of sight!

470
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:50,218
Let's suck my blood
until I'm dead in the gutter.

471
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:53,069
I'm sorry.

472
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:55,593
That was your idea.

473
00:33:56,716 --> 00:33:59,013
We could advertise in the newspaper.

474
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:00,898
Newspaper?

475
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:04,382
Look, this is the ad I've been working on.

476
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:07,416
You're gonna advertise
my ruined career and reputation?

477
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,851
That's very interesting, but...

478
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:14,672
you know, doctors never advertise.

479
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:19,081
- That's because they haven't had to.
- Shut up! Just leave me alone!

480
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:21,926
In fact, stay out of my sight.

481
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:38,231
Oh, my goodness.

482
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:40,564
What?

483
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,877
Not only am I married to a man...

484
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:48,245
who stuffs women's breasts for a living...

485
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:51,660
now everybody at the Club's
gonna know about it!

486
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:01,883
Hey, you!

487
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:06,653
Don't you say one thing to me!
Don't you say one word!

488
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:11,186
It's all an act, isn't it?

489
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:14,228
I thought you were a moron,
but you aren't, are you?

490
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,626
No, you're smart. You're very smart!

491
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:19,343
How else could you ruin my life
with such precision?

492
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:21,864
- You saw the...
- Shut up! Not one word.

493
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,658
You don't speak!

494
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:27,011
What did I ever do to you?

495
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:32,035
Know what?
I want your things out of my office.

496
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,578
I'm just gonna get you started here.

497
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,328
Okay, I just need you to fill this out.

498
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:43,160
Good morning, Doctors.

499
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:54,339
Yeah.

500
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:17,740
- Good morning, Dr. Larson.
- Good morning, Dr. Saunders.

501
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:28,132
I want you to understand all your options.

502
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:30,946
You can go in through the crease
under the breast...

503
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:31,996
through the nipple...

504
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,214
or through the underarm.

505
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:36,447
You can go over the muscle
or behind the muscle.

506
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:38,813
We can accentuate cleavage or volume.

507
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:41,494
We can give you
the classic teardrop shape.

508
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:43,860
a fuller melon-shaped breast.

509
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:45,869
Different patients react differently to pain.

510
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,436
We can make the nipples point up.

511
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:49,644
There might be bruising or swelling.

512
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:53,161
And there's no real maintenance.
It's not like changing a tire.

513
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:55,599
You don't have to rotate them
every 10,000 miles.

514
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:59,464
For most women, it's something you can
do on Monday and be working Wednesday.

515
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:03,867
Although you will have to massage them
frequently at first, preferably at home.

516
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,305
When you're 80,
your breasts will still look 18.

517
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:08,505
That's left to right and then top to bottom.

518
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,115
Occasionally, they can harden up a little.
If that happens...

519
00:37:12,283 --> 00:37:15,794
you come back to us
and we'll soften them up for you.

520
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,061
Feel better?

521
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:22,669
- We can go through the nipple.
- You'll be popular at the nursing home.

522
00:37:22,736 --> 00:37:24,905
- The nipple or the underarm.
- Absolutely safe.

523
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,060
Only danger is, God forbid,
you get stabbed in the chest.

524
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,676
We can make the nipples point up.

525
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:34,971
It's absolutely safe.

526
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,670
Any questions?

527
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:38,619
When can I schedule?

528
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:44,982
Would it be too soon
to do it on Monday, dear?

529
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:12,627
Hey! How you doing?

530
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:15,150
What you got for me today?

531
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,198
More of them big old bags?

532
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:22,633
I swear, it's just like Christmas
every single time you come.

533
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:26,668
- Okay, here we go, almost there.
- Wait.

534
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:32,358
- Okay.
- Okay?

535
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:33,979
Here we go.

536
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:50,195
They're beautiful.

537
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:54,949
You're gonna push, push in...

538
00:38:55,663 --> 00:38:57,384
and lift up, okay?

539
00:38:58,028 --> 00:39:02,116
Then you want to massage them gently
clockwise, like this.

540
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:04,994
And counterclockwise, like this.

541
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:11,965
Every day, several times a day, okay?

542
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:19,949
Any questions?

543
00:39:21,203 --> 00:39:23,438
Yeah. Show me again.

544
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:28,611
It's too much muscle!

545
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:33,313
Sorry I'm late.
I had to stop off at the bank.

546
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,695
I got you a little surprise.

547
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:42,200
- What's this?
- It's your royalty check for this month.

548
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:46,296
Oh, my God.

549
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:50,923
Do you know how much
I'm gonna owe in taxes on this?

550
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:52,937
Yeah, those taxes.

551
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,723
They're killing me!

552
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,405
I understand. If someone cancels,
I can schedule you.

553
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:04,641
But that's the best I can do.

554
00:40:04,806 --> 00:40:07,484
How much can I pay you
to cancel someone?

555
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,957
Ma'am, the doctors
are really busy right now.

556
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:14,482
I'd like to help you if I could, but I can't.

557
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,382
- Hello, Laura.
- Hi, Kevin.

558
00:40:28,749 --> 00:40:30,853
It looks like you're doing well.

559
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:32,360
Been busy.

560
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,757
My sister Katy is really happy
with her results.

561
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:38,686
Good.

562
00:40:38,882 --> 00:40:42,042
Makes me regret I didn't take you up
on your offer at Baylor...

563
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,791
when I could've gotten them for free.

564
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,227
How's Steve?

565
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:52,332
We got divorced about three months ago.

566
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:53,936
I'm sorry.

567
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:56,747
He's not such a nice guy, it turns out.

568
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,292
You look good.

569
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:02,593
Thanks.

570
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:04,958
But I want to look better.

571
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:09,599
I was thinking that...

572
00:41:09,697 --> 00:41:13,945
maybe you could give me
something like you gave Katy.

573
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,415
I mean, I'm a little more skinny on top
and she's more...

574
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:20,940
Yeah.

575
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:25,156
You're probably totally used to this, right?

576
00:41:25,327 --> 00:41:27,911
I should just show you.

577
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:29,860
Okay.

578
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,396
It's good to see you again.

579
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:46,487
- What do you think?
- I think they're super.

580
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,470
Thanks!

581
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:50,350
I think we could go bigger.

582
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:52,075
How big?

583
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:54,983
They're not too small?

584
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:58,244
You don't think we should go with...

585
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,821
350cc, maybe?

586
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,804
They're perfect.

587
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:08,002
They should be.
He spent four hours working on them.

588
00:42:09,538 --> 00:42:12,666
- Do you want me to close?
- No, I'll do it.

589
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:17,170
I don't want even a hint of a scar.

590
00:42:24,434 --> 00:42:26,572
Come on, get a picture of this.

591
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:44,406
I mean...

592
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:47,480
will a guy be able to tell that I have...

593
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:48,473
you know...

594
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,356
Can you come here for a sec?

595
00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:58,892
- Would you mind?
- No.

596
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:16,026
Go ahead, touch them.

597
00:43:16,603 --> 00:43:17,812
Go ahead.

598
00:43:23,665 --> 00:43:25,999
Those are... They're perfect.

599
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:30,088
I wouldn't do anything to you
that I wouldn't do to my wife.

600
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,965
Within reason.

601
00:43:33,607 --> 00:43:37,020
I won't say it didn't hurt,
it felt like a ton of bricks fell on my chest.

602
00:43:37,093 --> 00:43:40,407
But the first time I saw
my two new best friends, I was like:

603
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:42,869
"Oh, my God, it was worth it!"

604
00:43:42,944 --> 00:43:45,524
My shoulders fit me now. I have a waist.

605
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:47,862
I've been reborn, I rock!

606
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:50,164
This is the way
I was always meant to look.

607
00:43:50,232 --> 00:43:51,790
This is about artistry.

608
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:55,502
This is not some ham-fisted,
cut-and-stuff procedure.

609
00:43:55,922 --> 00:44:00,193
If you approach it like it is, you'll end up
with some extremely unhappy women...

610
00:44:00,268 --> 00:44:04,061
with displeasing, wandering or...

611
00:44:04,615 --> 00:44:06,021
walleyed breasts.

612
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:09,594
They'll be angry at you
and you'll be out of business quickly.

613
00:44:09,696 --> 00:44:12,793
This surgeon really
completely messed this one up.

614
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,563
We call this one the Marty Feldman.

615
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:19,317
This guy really messed this one up.

616
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:23,530
If you perform the operation properly...

617
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:28,393
you'll receive letters from women
thanking you for saving their lives.

618
00:44:28,814 --> 00:44:30,884
In fact, I got...

619
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:39,127
I didn't bring them with me. Kevin,
would you run and get some of the letters?

620
00:44:41,506 --> 00:44:44,186
Why don't you get them? I'll take over.

621
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:48,341
That's all right. The letters,
could you go get them, please?

622
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,196
I can handle the rest of the questions
while you get them.

623
00:44:56,784 --> 00:44:59,564
Laura was going through the books
last night.

624
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:03,007
Really? Is Laura our accountant now?

625
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:07,839
It looks like you received a Dow Corning
royalty payment last month.

626
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:10,328
Really?

627
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:13,210
I don't remember receiving
my share of that.

628
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:16,049
I need more suction here.

629
00:45:17,177 --> 00:45:19,031
If the truth be known...

630
00:45:19,832 --> 00:45:21,740
it's because I'm stealing from you.

631
00:45:22,005 --> 00:45:23,979
I'm robbing you for the fun of it.

632
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:28,037
- I wasn't accusing you of stealing.
- The hell you weren't.

633
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,478
The hell.

634
00:45:29,548 --> 00:45:31,880
Could I get some suction here?

635
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:34,599
I'm bringing you your sutures.

636
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,317
"Please."

637
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:39,448
"Can I get some suction here, please?"

638
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:42,142
Let's try to treat my wife with respect.

639
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:45,980
In here, she is my employee,
she is not your wife.

640
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,436
Is that a problem?

641
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:52,138
Because if that's a problem,
I'll get a new employee.

642
00:45:56,816 --> 00:46:00,523
Let me get this right.
They won't explode when you're flying.

643
00:46:00,877 --> 00:46:03,457
They didn't when I flew up here
from Texas.

644
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:06,210
Bert, there are many augmented
flight attendants...

645
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:09,537
and I don't believe I've ever heard
of any problems.

646
00:46:09,795 --> 00:46:13,883
- They do help me swim a lot better.
- All right.

647
00:46:14,142 --> 00:46:18,097
Tell us, what kind of woman
has her breasts augmented?

648
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:21,101
- There are so many...
- The typical woman who comes to see us...

649
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:22,863
Excuse me, can I finish?

650
00:46:22,932 --> 00:46:26,508
She has a husband who isn't maturing
as quickly as she is.

651
00:46:27,153 --> 00:46:30,890
The girls flock around him,
he looks good on the golf course.

652
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:34,305
Meanwhile, she's borne all the children,
her breasts are sagging...

653
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:37,190
and she wants the operation
so she can feel good again.

654
00:46:37,255 --> 00:46:41,147
In one respect, it isn't important
what he thinks you look like.

655
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:45,458
What's important is what you think
he thinks you look like.

656
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:48,463
- That's exactly right.
- Very well put.

657
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:52,277
Actually, you're like psychiatrists
with knives!

658
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,031
- In a way, yes.
- No, I...

659
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:56,105
We get lots of referrals from psychiatrists.

660
00:46:56,178 --> 00:46:59,556
They know how important it is
for a woman to be able to...

661
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:02,507
buy a bathing suit
without getting depressed.

662
00:47:02,604 --> 00:47:06,822
Or walk into a room in a strapless dress,
knowing heads will turn.

663
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:09,758
That's why we've come up with
this natural-feel implant.

664
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,758
What? What we came up with?

665
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:14,867
I don't remember you coming up
with anything.

666
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,805
- Do you want to go somewhere and confer?
- Honey, let's not get into this.

667
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:23,025
Let's get right into it. What exactly,
specifically, did you come up with?

668
00:47:23,412 --> 00:47:26,126
- I don't think this is the time or place.
- What?

669
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,971
By "come up with," you mean what?
"To steal"?

670
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:32,230
By "come up with" meaning
"to take undeserved credit"?

671
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:36,091
- You know better than that.
- What do you mean by "come up with"?

672
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,617
I provided you with the knowledge.

673
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:42,170
Provided you with the knowledge,
the finances...

674
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:44,629
the surgical expertise, the credibility.

675
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,769
Credibility? Fuck!

676
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:49,647
What would you have done?

677
00:47:49,977 --> 00:47:53,106
A 25-year-old resident who nearly got
kicked out of medical school.

678
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:55,888
Who never once performed a surgery.

679
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,245
- Isn't that a bit self-delusional?
- I would've done fine without you.

680
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,053
- You would've done nothing.
- I would've done fine.

681
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:06,789
Then, my friend, why don't you try it?
Why don't you try doing fine without me?

682
00:48:07,814 --> 00:48:10,430
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

683
00:48:14,878 --> 00:48:16,697
Come on.

684
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,923
How do I get this thing off?

685
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:22,860
Someone help her with her equipment.
Dear, you're welcome to...

686
00:48:22,935 --> 00:48:25,102
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

687
00:48:25,746 --> 00:48:28,427
So much for the magic of live television.

688
00:48:28,496 --> 00:48:32,649
We're still here with the remaining
inventor of the silicone implant.

689
00:48:32,715 --> 00:48:34,438
I don't think so.

690
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:39,038
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Little twerp.

691
00:48:40,865 --> 00:48:43,002
I work at a chocolate factory.

692
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:46,069
That's very interesting.
We may explore that a little more.

693
00:48:46,494 --> 00:48:50,797
I said, "He's insane!" That's right,
he's lost his grasp on... Come on!

694
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:55,689
He's lost his grasp on reality. Hello?
He's berserk!

695
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:59,185
It was difficult but I had to let him go,
he didn't leave.

696
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:02,211
Because our patients
deserve the best results.

697
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:04,069
Some of his work was...

698
00:49:04,713 --> 00:49:08,059
I felt that I could not stand behind him.

699
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:13,183
When I came up with the implant idea,
he had trouble even saying "breast."

700
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:14,611
Thank you.

701
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:16,212
He would proposition women...

702
00:49:16,668 --> 00:49:18,325
while they were still on the table.

703
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:20,822
You want toilet plunger breasts?
He's the man!

704
00:49:20,887 --> 00:49:25,108
You want numb nipples?
You want nipples that won't get erect?

705
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,165
Call me old-fashioned,
call me anything you want to.

706
00:49:28,304 --> 00:49:31,683
Wrecked, ugly, wrecked nipples!

707
00:49:31,852 --> 00:49:33,890
Every patient was a potential date for him.

708
00:49:33,994 --> 00:49:35,651
What? Did he tell you that?

709
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:38,018
Of course I can't reveal names.

710
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,658
Hold on. Can I ask you something?
Did you sleep with my patients?

711
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,214
Did you sleep with my patients?

712
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,447
You didn't? Can you prove it?

713
00:49:47,963 --> 00:49:49,338
Can you prove it?

714
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,006
No you can't, can you?
You can't prove a negative, can you?

715
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,928
Isn't that some, Jesus Christ...

716
00:49:54,996 --> 00:49:58,092
some journalistic axiom or something?

717
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,713
You're an investigative reporter,
aren't you?

718
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:03,944
Why don't you do some investigating?

719
00:50:06,982 --> 00:50:09,762
- Is Mrs. Hummings here?
- No.

720
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,327
Did she not show up?

721
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:20,944
No.

722
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:25,649
What the fuck?

723
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:28,647
Is that the third no-show this week?

724
00:50:30,669 --> 00:50:34,049
That son of a bitch.
I knew he'd do something like this.

725
00:50:35,018 --> 00:50:37,883
- Who are you talking about, sweet pea?
- Larson, goddamn it.

726
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:40,674
That son of a bitch,
he's clogged our appointment book...

727
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,041
with these phony appointments.

728
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,241
But, honey, we have plenty of open slots.

729
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,983
This is what I want you to do:
Call his office, start booking appointments.

730
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,097
Use a fake name.

731
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:54,575
Book a breast augmentation and a nose job
every half hour, a skin graft, okay?

732
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:58,477
You're talking like a crazy person
and I am now ignoring you.

733
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:00,522
- Pick up the phone.
- No.

734
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:03,716
- Pick up the phone!
- No!

735
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:05,994
We have had six patients this week.

736
00:51:06,091 --> 00:51:10,273
We can't make any prank phone calls,
because we can't pay our phone bill.

737
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:15,678
Did you call Health and Fitness Magazine
about buying an ad? Did you?

738
00:51:15,775 --> 00:51:16,984
No, I did not.

739
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:18,261
Pick up the phone.

740
00:51:20,508 --> 00:51:22,359
We can't run any ads...

741
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:26,729
because we are totally and completely
out of money.

742
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,841
What are you saying?

743
00:51:33,198 --> 00:51:35,016
I am so frustrated.

744
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:41,122
We don't have any money.

745
00:51:41,986 --> 00:51:43,742
The fact is, Dr. Saunders...

746
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,698
you were an employee of Dr. Larson's
when you aided in the conception of this...

747
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,444
"Aided in the conception?"
We were partners. I invented it.

748
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:55,469
All royalties from Dow Corning
are controlled directly by him.

749
00:51:56,021 --> 00:52:00,105
Admit it, between you and me,
man to man, no one else around...

750
00:52:00,206 --> 00:52:02,790
just tell me it's bullshit, isn't it?

751
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,713
It's wrong. It's bullshit.

752
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:09,956
His previous generosity towards you
in no way obligates him...

753
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:12,734
This is unbelievable.
You're going straight to hell.

754
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,515
You son of a bitch, you're going to hell.

755
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:17,557
Talk to Dow.

756
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,719
- Can't get into your car?
- Watch it.

757
00:52:21,784 --> 00:52:22,832
Sue me, prick.

758
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,510
I talked to our legal department
before I came down here.

759
00:52:30,895 --> 00:52:34,666
There's nothing we can do to alter
the original royalty agreement.

760
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:39,482
What I can do is negotiate more
favorable terms on the price of implants...

761
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:41,311
if you order in bulk.

762
00:52:41,731 --> 00:52:45,174
You don't understand something.
I don't need cheaper implants.

763
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:47,254
I need women to put them into!

764
00:52:48,285 --> 00:52:49,974
You can go, grandma!

765
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:52,884
What the hell?

766
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:56,657
What I need is a good bankruptcy lawyer
and a gun.

767
00:52:56,723 --> 00:53:00,037
A gun with a bullet
to put through my fucking head.

768
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:02,861
You need to calm down and relax.

769
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:04,392
Turn here.

770
00:53:14,178 --> 00:53:15,835
What is this place?

771
00:53:16,253 --> 00:53:19,066
A testament to all the good you've done.

772
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:30,509
Hey, Gerald! Wonderful to see you again.

773
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:33,769
- It's been a long time. How's it going?
- Great seeing you.

774
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:38,142
I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Saunders,
the plastic surgeon I was telling you about.

775
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:41,724
Wonderful to meet you. I'm Andy Rinough.
Welcome to Remy's.

776
00:53:41,795 --> 00:53:43,070
Thanks.

777
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:46,587
Would you like to join me upstairs?

778
00:53:46,654 --> 00:53:50,000
- I'd like to go upstairs. Would you?
- What's upstairs?

779
00:53:50,715 --> 00:53:51,991
Come on.

780
00:54:01,967 --> 00:54:04,836
We got ourselves a new baby girl.

781
00:54:05,293 --> 00:54:08,102
Gentlemen, put your hands together.

782
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:39,229
Sit right over here.

783
00:54:42,308 --> 00:54:43,736
How you doing?

784
00:54:53,304 --> 00:54:55,189
This is unbelievable.

785
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:56,883
Here we go.

786
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:02,604
I'm a big fan of your work.

787
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:09,286
- Dr. Saunders?
- Yes?

788
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:11,425
Hi! Don't you remember me?

789
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,254
I'm Savannah. I used to be Jessica.

790
00:55:16,641 --> 00:55:17,654
Yes.

791
00:55:19,038 --> 00:55:21,174
Dr. Saunders, you gave me these.

792
00:55:22,363 --> 00:55:23,984
I just love them.

793
00:55:25,046 --> 00:55:26,768
They're great.

794
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:34,599
I love this song.

795
00:55:35,405 --> 00:55:36,711
It's funky.

796
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:40,859
- Can I dance for you?
- No, thank you. Thanks very much.

797
00:56:31,952 --> 00:56:35,461
Breasts: They have this powerful duality...

798
00:56:35,532 --> 00:56:39,207
as both signage
designed to attract the opposite sex...

799
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:42,976
and then as a food source
to nurture the offspring of the alliance.

800
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:47,509
They also give off special energy
because they're circles within circles.

801
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,546
I hate to put a label on myself,
but I am a feminist.

802
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:54,413
I got the surgery, not in spite of,
but because of that fact.

803
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:57,297
I think obtaining
a culturally rewarded appearance...

804
00:56:57,363 --> 00:57:02,031
as politically incorrect as that sounds,
is a liberating experience.

805
00:57:04,335 --> 00:57:05,760
Hi, Vanessa.

806
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:08,448
You can't smoke in here.

807
00:57:09,704 --> 00:57:11,044
I'm sorry.

808
00:57:11,942 --> 00:57:13,598
I'm very unhappy.

809
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:17,049
What's wrong?
Is everything okay with the augmentation?

810
00:57:17,505 --> 00:57:19,159
They're disgusting.

811
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:20,499
What do you mean?

812
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:23,701
They're disgusting and flat, not big enough.

813
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:26,637
I feel like a boy. I want them bigger.

814
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:33,962
Your breasts are perfect.

815
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:36,705
They're great.

816
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:38,119
You've had...

817
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:43,169
what would be considered a very large
augmentation eight months ago.

818
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:47,416
It's not good enough anymore.
It was at first and now it isn't.

819
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:51,065
In the before-and-after picture,
you're already in the "after."

820
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:52,275
Do you understand?

821
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:54,194
You can make them bigger.

822
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:58,154
- I'm sorry, I can't do that.
- Bullshit!

823
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:01,419
You can. You put more stuff in them
and they'll get bigger.

824
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:04,517
What I'm saying is,
I've never performed an operation...

825
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:08,331
that I didn't feel
would be cosmetically beneficial.

826
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:12,220
What you're asking for,
it wouldn't make you look...

827
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:14,680
You have to stop smoking.

828
00:58:14,979 --> 00:58:16,439
I want them to be big.

829
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:18,811
Really big. That's what I want.

830
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:27,697
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, sweetie. Okay.

831
00:58:28,278 --> 00:58:29,967
This woman is huge!

832
00:58:32,753 --> 00:58:35,302
She wants to be bigger, all right?

833
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:39,399
I think she's big enough.

834
00:58:41,736 --> 00:58:42,912
Scalpel?

835
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:47,382
No.

836
00:58:48,605 --> 00:58:50,197
Come on.

837
00:58:50,397 --> 00:58:51,541
Scalpel?

838
00:58:53,018 --> 00:58:54,294
Thank you.

839
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:11,108
They tell me I drive too fast.
I already got five speeding tickets.

840
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:14,621
Know what I'm saying?

841
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:17,914
I'll be back.

842
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:24,847
Don't even start.

843
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:28,234
For God's sake!
She's not going to be able to buy clothes.

844
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,373
It's what the woman wants
and we need the money.

845
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:35,427
- What kind of job is she going to have?
- It's none of our business.

846
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:38,083
Don't ever walk out of surgery again.

847
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,324
Look at that.

848
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:45,283
- She's incredible.
- She's beautiful.

849
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,873
It's not too big?

850
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:49,757
She's making $1,000 a week,
they're not too big.

851
00:59:51,515 --> 00:59:53,173
Know what I'm going to do?

852
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,363
I'm gonna get every girl
who wants to have their boobs done...

853
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,534
and I'm gonna have them done by you.

854
00:59:59,604 --> 01:00:03,854
- You'll refer them to me?
- I'll direct them to you. Go on, take a hit.

855
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:06,218
- No, I've had enough.
- Come on, be a man.

856
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:11,078
I'm gonna refer them to you and in return,
you'll pay me some kind of referral fee.

857
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:17,020
What kind of referral fee
are you talking about?

858
01:00:17,343 --> 01:00:21,366
I don't know. Maybe 10, 15 percent...

859
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,792
10 percent of what you charge.

860
01:00:23,867 --> 01:00:26,931
This is the best promotion
you can ever hope for.

861
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,621
When men see her...

862
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,455
you'll have their wives
in your office the next day.

863
01:00:41,193 --> 01:00:42,302
Marker.

864
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:45,533
- Guys wanna get their hands on these.
- Jesus!

865
01:00:45,603 --> 01:00:49,080
These women with National Geographic
boobs drooping around their waist...

866
01:00:49,152 --> 01:00:50,906
of course their boyfriends look at me.

867
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:54,508
I needed my teeth fixed, too,
but I only had enough money for one.

868
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:58,128
I think I made the right choice.
No one notices my teeth are crooked.

869
01:00:58,837 --> 01:01:00,264
Excuse me, Bill.

870
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,516
Look at that.

871
01:01:06,031 --> 01:01:10,726
Oh, my goodness. Same designers.
You'll have to keep your distance.

872
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:14,563
Are those my breasts?
They look awfully familiar.

873
01:01:16,355 --> 01:01:20,244
That's a completely different style.
It's teardrop shaped.

874
01:01:23,035 --> 01:01:26,862
I paid couture prices, you better not
have given me ready-to-wear.

875
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:29,042
My goodness.

876
01:01:32,432 --> 01:01:33,642
Oh, dear.

877
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:37,068
Where's the food?
Do you know where the food is?

878
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:39,074
No, that's liquor, sir.

879
01:01:39,244 --> 01:01:41,794
Excuse me for a moment, won't you?

880
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:44,476
Are you guys hungry?

881
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:45,787
Hold on. Hello.

882
01:01:45,858 --> 01:01:48,955
Don't walk away, I'm not done with you.
Thank you.

883
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:51,289
You can't do that.

884
01:01:53,436 --> 01:01:54,580
Hello, Kevin.

885
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:58,480
Well, hello, Bill.

886
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:01,520
I'd like to personally thank you...

887
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:05,031
for dispelling the notion of ethics
in plastic surgery.

888
01:02:05,231 --> 01:02:09,864
They were actually beginning to take us
seriously and you set us back 10 years.

889
01:02:10,123 --> 01:02:12,966
- I did? How did I do that?
- How?

890
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:14,846
By this.

891
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:17,053
By your behavior.

892
01:02:17,282 --> 01:02:21,108
Your whole behavior, your lack of integrity,
your damn persona.

893
01:02:23,386 --> 01:02:24,978
You make them too big.

894
01:02:25,465 --> 01:02:29,106
I give the customers
what they ask for, you jackass.

895
01:02:29,302 --> 01:02:32,114
- Different women want different things.
- Really?

896
01:02:32,179 --> 01:02:34,317
To look like circus freaks?

897
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:36,009
Freaks?

898
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:40,996
You call them freaks, that's very telling.
I find that very telling about you.

899
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:45,727
What you're doing is perverse.

900
01:02:47,715 --> 01:02:49,140
Go to hell.

901
01:02:52,637 --> 01:02:54,937
It's always nice to see you.

902
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,512
You should be ashamed of yourself.

903
01:02:58,615 --> 01:03:03,050
Mutilating your body to fulfill
some kind of male pornographic fantasy!

904
01:03:03,152 --> 01:03:06,978
I am not fulfilling anybody's fantasy.
I did this for myself, honey.

905
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:09,609
You did it because Playboy tells you...

906
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:12,222
Don't tell me why I did what I did,
all right?

907
01:03:12,297 --> 01:03:16,284
Phil, I think it's important to realize that...

908
01:03:16,675 --> 01:03:19,290
many intelligent women
find the operation empowering.

909
01:03:19,647 --> 01:03:21,271
Hold on!

910
01:03:22,525 --> 01:03:26,548
I think these women are jealous.
They know that girl... What's her name?

911
01:03:26,618 --> 01:03:28,948
- Cindy.
- They know Cindy looks better than them.

912
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:32,426
- Please!
- I'd have the operation if I could afford it.

913
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:34,189
Do you do charity work?

914
01:03:36,048 --> 01:03:38,055
Charity work, Doctor, how about that?

915
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:41,508
In most tribal societies, this is the ideal.

916
01:03:41,961 --> 01:03:44,641
Sagging breasts are a sign of beauty...

917
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:47,391
symbolizing pregnancy and childbirth.

918
01:03:47,459 --> 01:03:50,652
Only in our culture is this the ideal:

919
01:03:51,072 --> 01:03:52,955
An upright, adolescent breast.

920
01:03:53,787 --> 01:03:57,843
What this doctor has created
is this Barbie-doll look.

921
01:03:58,104 --> 01:04:00,622
It's a body type simply not found in nature.

922
01:04:00,789 --> 01:04:05,800
I think it's important to draw a distinction
between reasonable, ethical doctors...

923
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:09,248
such as myself and Dr. Franklin Rose,
a handful of others.

924
01:04:11,689 --> 01:04:14,653
This woman,
and I'm sure you're a nice woman.

925
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,316
Thank you, Doctor.

926
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:21,018
She's not one of my patients
and she's not representative of my work.

927
01:04:21,598 --> 01:04:23,832
My doctor is Kevin Saunders.

928
01:04:24,189 --> 01:04:25,560
Hi, Kevin.

929
01:04:26,522 --> 01:04:27,950
I love what you do for me.

930
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,621
How is it? Is it good?

931
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,873
I think I just burst a blood vessel.

932
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:45,754
Look, you missed some.
You'll have to try it again.

933
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,648
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

934
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,742
You're a very bad girl. You're very bad.
You're wicked.

935
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:43,333
Hello.

936
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:10,019
I'm sorry.

937
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:37,551
I used to work in investment banking
and was totally respected for my mind.

938
01:06:37,616 --> 01:06:41,091
For reasons unrelated to work,
I decided to get the surgery done.

939
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,949
The strangest thing happened:

940
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:46,438
All the guys I worked with began
treating me like a moronic bimbo.

941
01:06:46,726 --> 01:06:50,040
I've known them for years,
and now they were calling me...

942
01:06:50,115 --> 01:06:53,109
baby and doll face and sweet pants.

943
01:06:53,662 --> 01:06:57,171
It's like in one weekend,
I went from being a respected equal...

944
01:06:57,242 --> 01:07:01,809
to some kind of totally vacuous,
available, helpless, slut secretary.

945
01:07:02,037 --> 01:07:06,254
Like I'd paid the doctor to take out
my brain and stuff it in my tits.

946
01:07:12,651 --> 01:07:13,827
Here we are!

947
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:17,052
Come on, don't be shy.

948
01:07:17,539 --> 01:07:20,570
He built this house
when he got divorced in '83.

949
01:07:21,568 --> 01:07:23,802
30,000 square feet.

950
01:07:23,871 --> 01:07:25,625
- Hey, Bitsy.
- Hey there!

951
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:29,909
Marble floors from Italy.
Honduras mahogany railings.

952
01:07:30,677 --> 01:07:33,545
Lots of these Impressionist paintings
from France.

953
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,432
They say he can have me ready
by the August issue.

954
01:07:36,497 --> 01:07:38,983
He's the Penthouse plastic surgeon.

955
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,626
He can take a dump truck
and hammer her into a Ferrari.

956
01:07:42,696 --> 01:07:44,800
That's my favorite car!

957
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:47,524
Don't be afraid to go too big.

958
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:51,132
Dr. Saunders can fit in 400cc implants...

959
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:55,667
when every other surgeon is saying
they can't squeeze in 200cc.

960
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,804
- Hi, hon. How you feeling?
- Good!

961
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:02,356
- Hey, girls!
- Hi, Judith!

962
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:04,652
That's Janice.

963
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,047
She's going out with a very famous star...

964
01:08:07,118 --> 01:08:09,986
whose name you would recognize
if I said it.

965
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:11,337
But I can't.

966
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:16,131
He's paying to have the implants
her old boyfriend gave her...

967
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:18,466
replaced with new implants.

968
01:08:20,415 --> 01:08:24,952
Some of the girls like to come here
to rest up after the operation.

969
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:26,874
- Here you are, Doctor.
- Thanks.

970
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:29,043
That's Summer. Hey, girl.

971
01:08:30,009 --> 01:08:33,417
She's here to prepare
for her Falcon Crest audition.

972
01:08:35,952 --> 01:08:37,413
This is Ashley.

973
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:39,532
- Hello, Ashley.
- Hi.

974
01:08:39,597 --> 01:08:41,635
Thank you. How was your flight?

975
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,713
Great. I'm so excited to be here!

976
01:08:43,915 --> 01:08:46,145
We're excited to have you here.

977
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,429
Jennifer, you wanna get Ashley a cocktail?

978
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,084
- Are you hungry?
- No.

979
01:08:53,632 --> 01:08:55,735
It's all right if you are.

980
01:09:02,422 --> 01:09:05,169
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Dr. Larson.

981
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:10,661
- Aren't you speaking today?
- In about 15 minutes. Join us.

982
01:09:17,382 --> 01:09:20,607
- Dr. William Larson?
- Yes, sir?

983
01:09:20,675 --> 01:09:24,825
I don't know if you remember me or not.
We talked in the '85 convention.

984
01:09:25,308 --> 01:09:26,616
Jim Kidder.

985
01:09:28,026 --> 01:09:30,163
Honey, come here.
I'm sure you remember.

986
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:33,012
I am such a fan.
I've always known you're a genius.

987
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:36,519
This is Dr. Larson.
He invented what you got right there!

988
01:09:36,751 --> 01:09:40,011
You know what? I've got a funny idea.
This is funny.

989
01:09:40,205 --> 01:09:43,879
Don't you think it'd be funny if you...
Could you autograph those?

990
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:45,668
That would be great.

991
01:09:46,695 --> 01:09:49,373
- A little unusual.
- It'd mean so much.

992
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:52,311
Bless your heart.

993
01:09:57,245 --> 01:10:01,493
- Could you sign mine, too, please?
- This is getting to be a little silly, now.

994
01:10:01,717 --> 01:10:03,145
Oh, my God.

995
01:10:04,755 --> 01:10:06,412
Sign them, you fucker.

996
01:10:09,103 --> 01:10:10,150
Lady, please.

997
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:13,794
- This is what you did to me.
- You don't need to do this in here.

998
01:10:14,472 --> 01:10:17,405
It's a little embarrassing.
Please put your sweater down.

999
01:10:17,477 --> 01:10:19,648
You don't have anything to say to me?

1000
01:10:19,717 --> 01:10:24,283
Yes, I do. Put your sweater down
or I'll have security take you out.

1001
01:10:27,162 --> 01:10:28,470
Fuck you.

1002
01:10:28,697 --> 01:10:31,150
- Ma'am, let's go.
- Goddamn you.

1003
01:10:31,223 --> 01:10:33,196
Fuck off! Goddamn you!

1004
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,816
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1005
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,028
That's not right.

1006
01:10:45,223 --> 01:10:47,230
- Sorry, sir.
- Excuse me.

1007
01:10:48,997 --> 01:10:50,884
We can make you look something...

1008
01:10:51,204 --> 01:10:52,954
like this.

1009
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:57,428
- No?
- Not really.

1010
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,457
It's nice,
but if you really want to stop the trains...

1011
01:11:03,446 --> 01:11:05,612
we can do something like that.

1012
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:10,541
Then, we would take your nipple...

1013
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,289
move it up to here.

1014
01:11:15,401 --> 01:11:17,440
It's hard to believe, right?

1015
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,935
She had an augmentation in '87.

1016
01:11:20,195 --> 01:11:22,911
I think if she'd gone bigger...

1017
01:11:22,977 --> 01:11:25,820
her career would be
in better shape today.

1018
01:11:29,275 --> 01:11:32,085
Half of Hollywood is wearing my breasts.

1019
01:11:32,182 --> 01:11:36,401
It's true: Pamela Anderson,
Dolly Parton, Cher.

1020
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:42,723
In fact, Victoria's real secret is that
everyone in that catalog are my patients.

1021
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,148
This is all off the record, of course.

1022
01:11:47,077 --> 01:11:51,232
They're fantasy in the flesh.
The perfect female form.

1023
01:11:51,299 --> 01:11:52,345
That's me!

1024
01:11:52,418 --> 01:11:55,828
Here's the man responsible
for this veritable Garden of Eden.

1025
01:11:55,932 --> 01:11:57,359
Meet Dr. Kevin Saunders.

1026
01:11:57,435 --> 01:12:01,174
I think if she'd gone bigger,
her career would be in better shape today.

1027
01:12:01,432 --> 01:12:04,081
One of the inventors
of the silicone breast implant...

1028
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:06,537
and one of the country's
most prolific breast men...

1029
01:12:06,612 --> 01:12:09,323
Dr. Saunders doesn't hesitate
to brag about his work.

1030
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:11,178
Victoria's real secret...

1031
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:13,738
is all the women in the catalog
are my patients.

1032
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:18,374
It's true, day after day,
I work with women's breasts.

1033
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:21,627
It's a terrible job,
but someone's got to do it.

1034
01:12:21,697 --> 01:12:24,215
While Dr. Saunders is laughing...

1035
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:29,039
thousands of women are suffering
from silicone-induced autoimmune disease.

1036
01:12:29,146 --> 01:12:32,972
Health eroded, hopes destroyed,
Jane went back into the operating room.

1037
01:12:33,271 --> 01:12:35,601
This is what came out of her body.

1038
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:38,437
I had...

1039
01:12:39,598 --> 01:12:43,688
leakage from my right breast
of a clear liquid.

1040
01:12:43,821 --> 01:12:45,280
Leakage from the nipple...

1041
01:12:45,353 --> 01:12:49,024
fever, pneumonia, chest pains.
I knew there was something very wrong.

1042
01:12:49,091 --> 01:12:53,147
Karen was diagnosed with a disease
of the immune system called lupus.

1043
01:12:53,217 --> 01:12:56,859
I was absolutely shocked
to find out it was silicone.

1044
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,843
It was leaking from me for two years.

1045
01:12:58,973 --> 01:13:02,643
Had I known these things could rupture,
I never would've had this done.

1046
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:05,195
I thought they would last a lifetime.

1047
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:08,937
What are you left with now?

1048
01:13:11,342 --> 01:13:16,038
Where's my fucking phone?
Get me my cellular! Goddamn it.

1049
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:25,144
tell people about
what's happened to me, but...

1050
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:27,515
You're not going to die.

1051
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:32,430
I know you're scared,
but it was just a TV show.

1052
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,300
Do you believe everything you see on TV?

1053
01:13:36,883 --> 01:13:39,399
I'm sorry. Could you hold on, please?

1054
01:13:39,567 --> 01:13:43,687
You have 36 cancellations this week
and two death threats, one sounds serious.

1055
01:13:43,756 --> 01:13:46,436
The Times, Tribune,
Post, and Sun want to speak with you.

1056
01:13:46,633 --> 01:13:51,133
Channels 2, 4, 5 and 11
all want you on the news tonight.

1057
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:55,483
They found three women
out of three million...

1058
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:57,590
and they put them on TV.

1059
01:13:57,853 --> 01:14:00,055
That's what you call reasonable journalism.

1060
01:14:00,123 --> 01:14:02,261
Hush up, we got a surprise for you.

1061
01:14:03,285 --> 01:14:06,315
All right. One, two, three.

1062
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:12,006
Will you listen to what I'm telling you?

1063
01:14:12,111 --> 01:14:13,671
Silicone is in everything.

1064
01:14:13,966 --> 01:14:17,058
It's in potato chips, it's in antacids.
Are you wearing lipstick?

1065
01:14:17,128 --> 01:14:19,361
What is this connective tissue disease?

1066
01:14:19,557 --> 01:14:23,264
I'm not sure these nice people
want to listen to that right now.

1067
01:14:23,331 --> 01:14:25,662
What are people doing today?
Where's the statistics?

1068
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:27,963
- Happy birthday.
- Isn't that great?

1069
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:30,739
Maybe you should think about this
in another way.

1070
01:14:30,809 --> 01:14:32,531
In the way of a balance.

1071
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,508
Nature has a balance...

1072
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:39,279
which you should explore the possibility
that you have, in a karmic sense, upset.

1073
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,022
A karmic sense?

1074
01:14:42,092 --> 01:14:45,765
20,000 lawsuits and Dow's lawyers
are talking about settling.

1075
01:14:45,832 --> 01:14:47,009
May I have the keys?

1076
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,894
They're frightened.
It'll cost more to fight even if they win.

1077
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:51,866
- The goddamn car keys!
- Economic realities.

1078
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:55,130
What do you need the car keys for?
Where are you going?

1079
01:14:55,518 --> 01:14:58,679
I'm guilty because of my karma?
Is that what you're saying?

1080
01:14:58,746 --> 01:15:02,193
You're gonna talk to me about my karma?
Go ahead.

1081
01:15:03,129 --> 01:15:04,884
You're fucked.

1082
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:08,046
You are really fucked, karmically.

1083
01:15:12,077 --> 01:15:13,124
Get out.

1084
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:15,465
- Damn bastards.
- I gotta get going.

1085
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:18,278
There's one or two more here.

1086
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:21,921
We'll have the last laugh
when the truth comes out.

1087
01:15:24,032 --> 01:15:26,617
20,000 court cases, but...

1088
01:15:27,455 --> 01:15:29,460
they got no evidence.

1089
01:15:39,153 --> 01:15:41,453
Do you want to see the evidence?

1090
01:15:42,574 --> 01:15:43,783
There.

1091
01:15:44,842 --> 01:15:47,229
Right there. Maria Stern.

1092
01:15:47,463 --> 01:15:48,641
38 years old.

1093
01:15:48,838 --> 01:15:51,291
Can't even get to church on Sunday.

1094
01:15:51,395 --> 01:15:53,184
I'm going on record right now...

1095
01:15:53,252 --> 01:15:56,412
and saying
that science can be bought today.

1096
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:58,042
Take a good look at that.

1097
01:15:58,107 --> 01:16:00,887
That's what an explanted
silicone implant looks like.

1098
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:04,780
Brought to you by the same people
who brought you Agent Orange.

1099
01:16:06,006 --> 01:16:08,525
Lawyers don't give a damn about women.

1100
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:13,475
Money comes in, they knock them
out of the way to get their 50 percent first.

1101
01:16:13,548 --> 01:16:16,327
I do blame Dr. Saunders
and I do blame Dr. Larson!

1102
01:16:16,393 --> 01:16:19,775
I think they made millions and they knew!

1103
01:16:20,712 --> 01:16:21,954
They knew...

1104
01:16:23,744 --> 01:16:26,197
that these things
were making women sick!

1105
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:27,284
I got one.

1106
01:16:27,645 --> 01:16:31,952
How many lawyers does it take
to kick a nun's teeth in for 50 cents?

1107
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:34,006
How many?

1108
01:16:35,063 --> 01:16:36,620
Hell, all of them!

1109
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,170
All of them.

1110
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:50,020
We, the jury, in the above-entitled action...

1111
01:16:50,245 --> 01:16:53,209
find the defendant,
Dow Corning Corporation...

1112
01:16:53,602 --> 01:16:58,333
guilty of willful misconduct
and award the plaintiff $200,000...

1113
01:16:58,653 --> 01:17:01,398
$840,000 in compensatory damages...

1114
01:17:02,169 --> 01:17:04,140
$6.5 million in punitive damage...

1115
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:07,821
$25 million, including punitive damages.

1116
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:13,102
There's no proven correlation
between the sick women and the implants.

1117
01:17:13,168 --> 01:17:15,463
Thank you. No more questions.

1118
01:17:16,617 --> 01:17:19,681
I've never seen a jury so flagrantly biased.

1119
01:17:20,326 --> 01:17:21,273
Shut up.

1120
01:17:21,349 --> 01:17:24,381
This isn't over yet, we'll appeal.
This judge is an idiot.

1121
01:17:24,452 --> 01:17:28,188
I've heard enough out of you.
I said I want you to shut up.

1122
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:31,598
Hello, Kevin.

1123
01:17:34,777 --> 01:17:36,716
Been golfing any lately?

1124
01:17:37,845 --> 01:17:38,826
No.

1125
01:17:40,688 --> 01:17:42,508
My game's gone to hell.

1126
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:46,016
Today, I'm requesting a moratorium...

1127
01:17:46,314 --> 01:17:51,068
on the further use
of all silicone gel breast implants.

1128
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:55,769
David Kessler should read the Mayo Clinic
and the Harvard Medical School studies.

1129
01:17:55,841 --> 01:17:58,652
The number of sick women with implants
is proportional...

1130
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:01,018
to the sick women
in the general population.

1131
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:05,361
You think anyone is gonna want
to introduce a new medical product...

1132
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,532
after what happened here?

1133
01:18:08,306 --> 01:18:11,206
You couldn't get aspirin approved
by the FDA today.

1134
01:18:11,471 --> 01:18:15,976
I don't doubt that these women
are genuinely sick and I feel sorry for them.

1135
01:18:16,045 --> 01:18:17,600
The question is, "Why?"

1136
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,544
The problem is that the majority...

1137
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,897
the women who are happy
with their implants...

1138
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:28,374
aren't gonna stand up
at their next town meeting and say:

1139
01:18:28,448 --> 01:18:33,197
"Excuse me, I have augmented breasts
and I'm pleased as Punch with them."

1140
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:35,889
We got a lottery mentality in this country.

1141
01:18:36,118 --> 01:18:39,377
It tells us, "Why work
when you can sue someone?"

1142
01:18:40,626 --> 01:18:43,305
If they're gonna ban anything...

1143
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:47,236
why don't they ban
the silicone penile implants?

1144
01:18:47,338 --> 01:18:48,764
Know why they don't?

1145
01:18:48,936 --> 01:18:51,038
Because half of Congress has them.

1146
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:53,726
And they're nothing but
a bunch of goddamn hypocrites!

1147
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:54,778
How do you explain...

1148
01:18:54,851 --> 01:18:59,101
the medical community's
own reluctance to support you?

1149
01:18:59,165 --> 01:19:03,317
You work hard all your life.

1150
01:19:04,633 --> 01:19:06,605
You are trying...

1151
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:10,471
to live a life that is decent and honest.

1152
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,807
You're trying to help people.

1153
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:15,435
You anticipate that...

1154
01:19:15,628 --> 01:19:18,115
one day you'll be told thank you.

1155
01:19:18,986 --> 01:19:21,118
But instead, you're attacked.

1156
01:19:21,636 --> 01:19:24,253
It's like the goddamn sky opened up...

1157
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:26,806
and you're assaulted with this...

1158
01:19:27,423 --> 01:19:30,717
vicious, mean-spirited...

1159
01:19:34,998 --> 01:19:38,704
Hell. I forgot, I don't know what it is.

1160
01:19:40,434 --> 01:19:41,579
I don't know.

1161
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:44,906
- We're gonna take a break...
- It's a bunch of bullshit.

1162
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:50,144
If you have silicone breast implants
and are experiencing these symptoms...

1163
01:19:50,216 --> 01:19:53,278
please call 1-800-RUPTURE.

1164
01:20:13,997 --> 01:20:17,061
- A lot of girls say they're getting sick.
- Did you talk to them?

1165
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:18,717
I'm not a doctor.

1166
01:20:18,793 --> 01:20:21,989
I know you're not a doctor.
Did you explain to them?

1167
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:26,423
- I didn't explain. All I know...
- Even if there's a leak, it gets trapped.

1168
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,819
There's a capsule of scar tissue.

1169
01:20:29,885 --> 01:20:32,272
The girls feel uncomfortable
when you're around.

1170
01:20:32,347 --> 01:20:34,713
- There's no risk involved.
- Go home.

1171
01:20:35,673 --> 01:20:37,643
Go home and don't come back.

1172
01:20:41,745 --> 01:20:43,118
Fuck you.

1173
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,784
The instant I saw them,
I knew I'd made a horrible mistake.

1174
01:21:18,856 --> 01:21:21,505
I was paranoid.
I felt like everyone would look at me...

1175
01:21:21,575 --> 01:21:24,093
and know that I was vain
and insecure and say:

1176
01:21:24,771 --> 01:21:27,137
"Jesus, who do you think you're fooling?"

1177
01:21:27,523 --> 01:21:31,193
- Why not have them removed?
- Like I need to have more explaining to do.

1178
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:37,614
You have sinus trouble? A little bit? Okay.

1179
01:21:37,847 --> 01:21:40,179
That shouldn't be a problem.

1180
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:44,042
I have to ask a few more questions.
Do you have Medicaid?

1181
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:45,516
Medicado?

1182
01:21:45,741 --> 01:21:48,292
I can try and strip them.

1183
01:21:50,794 --> 01:21:54,497
That's pretty expensive
and insurance won't cover it.

1184
01:21:57,568 --> 01:22:01,558
Why don't I just recommend
a good pair of support hose?

1185
01:22:15,022 --> 01:22:16,133
Hi.

1186
01:22:16,813 --> 01:22:17,795
How are you?

1187
01:22:21,126 --> 01:22:22,402
Not good.

1188
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:25,850
I've been sick.

1189
01:22:27,969 --> 01:22:29,463
What's the matter?

1190
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,442
What are your symptoms?

1191
01:22:36,984 --> 01:22:38,575
I'm tired.

1192
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:41,615
I'm tired all the time.

1193
01:22:43,794 --> 01:22:45,644
My mouth is dry.

1194
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,906
My eyes are dry.

1195
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:50,791
I have this...

1196
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:56,093
constant pain on the left side of my body.

1197
01:22:58,591 --> 01:23:01,337
The scariest part is...

1198
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:04,855
nobody can seem to tell me why.

1199
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:11,501
We're gonna do a complete workup on you.

1200
01:23:12,561 --> 01:23:15,624
Take some blood. Let me get the nurse.

1201
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,280
I just want them out.

1202
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:22,906
I figured that you put them in...

1203
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:26,079
so you'd know best
how to take them out.

1204
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,850
I just want them out.

1205
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:06,418
Doctor, I'm going to the ladies' room.

1206
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:31,290
I wouldn't think of it as a removal,
so to speak.

1207
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:34,486
You're actually acquiring
a new sense of well-being.

1208
01:24:34,746 --> 01:24:39,627
We'll explant the silicone implant, which
will be fully covered by your insurance.

1209
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:43,919
If you want to swap, I think you'll be
very happy with our new saline implants.

1210
01:24:43,984 --> 01:24:46,371
Of course, you'll have peace of mind.

1211
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:49,031
It's a personal choice. I know it's not easy.

1212
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,836
The point is to take away the worry
so you can focus on what really matters.

1213
01:24:52,902 --> 01:24:54,145
It's your body.

1214
01:24:54,213 --> 01:24:57,058
That's what is important,
that you feel comfortable.

1215
01:24:57,122 --> 01:25:01,177
I like to think of saline as a natural,
more organic procedure.

1216
01:25:01,246 --> 01:25:03,798
I'm sorry this whole thing
has made you depressed.

1217
01:25:03,869 --> 01:25:08,085
The point now is not to be depressed,
but to take positive action.

1218
01:25:08,182 --> 01:25:11,495
Perhaps trading up to a larger size
would be a pick-me-up.

1219
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:15,180
My original implant contained saline.
I told them from the start: saline.

1220
01:25:15,248 --> 01:25:18,592
You'll get two free visits
and a holistic mineral and relaxation kit.

1221
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:23,578
Tension and anxiety are the two
greatest causes of health problems.

1222
01:25:28,353 --> 01:25:32,820
Actually, you are making more
to take them out, aren't you?

1223
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:36,598
$7,000 to put them in.
You charge me again?

1224
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:40,175
You charge me again to take them out
and then...

1225
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:43,946
To put in the new ones, the safe ones...

1226
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:47,307
You're charging me again.

1227
01:25:48,717 --> 01:25:51,682
It costs more to take them out.

1228
01:25:52,489 --> 01:25:53,730
Insurance covers 80 percent.

1229
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:56,380
But you make more, actually.

1230
01:25:56,675 --> 01:25:59,160
$7,000 to put them in.

1231
01:25:59,391 --> 01:26:04,144
$4,800 to take them out,
another $2,000 for the saline.

1232
01:26:04,507 --> 01:26:06,808
Another $1,000 for the OR...

1233
01:26:09,557 --> 01:26:11,050
Okay, when do I schedule?

1234
01:26:11,123 --> 01:26:13,609
When can I schedule?

1235
01:26:15,407 --> 01:26:17,064
When could we schedule?

1236
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:19,300
You think we can put in a larger size?

1237
01:26:19,372 --> 01:26:22,499
Call Keddrick and tell him to fix it
or get it out.

1238
01:26:22,824 --> 01:26:26,364
It's too fucking hot, that's why.
And it's not herbal.

1239
01:26:26,818 --> 01:26:28,824
I paid for an herbal sauna.

1240
01:26:28,929 --> 01:26:32,603
He sends me this goddamn
Marquis de Sade sauna.

1241
01:26:32,702 --> 01:26:36,274
It smells like shit
and it scalds anyone who steps into it!

1242
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,908
Who else called?

1243
01:26:38,422 --> 01:26:41,290
Tell him I'll call him back.
I should be in soon.

1244
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:44,242
All right? So I'm right around the corner.

1245
01:26:49,323 --> 01:26:50,370
Fuck!

1246
01:27:25,637 --> 01:27:29,342
I've always had a strong image
of what kind of space I wanted to occupy.

1247
01:27:29,408 --> 01:27:30,716
This just isn't it.

1248
01:27:37,592 --> 01:27:39,151
I'm not ashamed about spending money.

1249
01:27:39,222 --> 01:27:41,587
You have a nice car,
you pay for its upkeep, right?

1250
01:27:49,613 --> 01:27:52,129
My mom's like this '60s hippie...

1251
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,743
who thinks breast implants are
part of some plot to control women.

1252
01:27:55,814 --> 01:27:58,430
People think only bimbos
and actresses get implants.

1253
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,041
Why do I have to have 18-year-old,
shoulder-level breasts, anyway?

1254
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:04,529
You can talk about beauty
being on the inside...

1255
01:28:04,603 --> 01:28:07,897
but no one's gonna come inside
unless you got curve appeal.

1256
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:10,195
I run my own company,
I've got a nice house...

1257
01:28:10,262 --> 01:28:13,008
I feel breasts are
the real basis of femininity.

1258
01:28:13,076 --> 01:28:16,584
- I can get my stomach flatter at the gym.
- It's not the same as a penis.

1259
01:28:16,655 --> 01:28:19,401
They have form and function
based on the concept of giving.

1260
01:28:19,499 --> 01:28:22,530
A penis isn't on display,
it doesn't have to fill a sweater.

1261
01:28:22,665 --> 01:28:25,445
You have glands and nipples.
Everything you need.

1262
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:28,535
Frankly to me,
all penises look pretty much the same.

1263
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:30,038
See how naturally they move?

1264
01:28:30,113 --> 01:28:31,637
My doctor is an artist.

1265
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:34,164
He has a vision of how
the female body should look.

1266
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:37,364
For women, breasts are the body part
that most profoundly...

1267
01:28:37,593 --> 01:28:39,763
It's my body, I've got to live with it.

1268
01:28:39,959 --> 01:28:44,263
After I got them, men who never
noticed me were dying to go out with me.

1269
01:28:44,497 --> 01:28:47,212
They aren't all that important, are they?

1270
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,212
Can I put my shirt back on now?
