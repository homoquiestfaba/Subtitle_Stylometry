1
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,276
What did they say?

2
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,685
Did you speak
to the real estate...

3
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,347
Where is she?

4
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,688
Well, well.
Where are her notes?

5
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,193
The notes we took with her.

6
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,127
I took the notes?

7
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,062
I don't think so.

8
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:58,035
No. We aren't going
to lose the house.

9
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,842
Look, I'm not minimizing it.

10
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,612
The easement?

11
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,047
Did she say easement?
What did she say?

12
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,051
Is it a term of art?

13
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,623
Are we bound by it?

14
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,127
I'm sorry. Are we...

15
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,130
Yes. Bound by it.

16
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,631
Look. Look.

17
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,135
Before the other side goes home,
all right?

18
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,034
A term of art.

19
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,141
Because. That's right.

20
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,804
The yard for the boy.
That's the whole...

21
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,110
I'll meet you there.
Is the realtor there?

22
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,343
Tell her to show you
the basement again.

23
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,650
Look at the...
I'm leaving in 10 or 15.

24
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:54,159
Yes. No, no.
I'll meet you at the new house.

25
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:58,220
That's a good...
If he thinks it's necessary.

26
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,266
You tell Jerry to meet,
all right?

27
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,931
No, we aren't going to lose
the deposit, all right?

28
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,271
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

29
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,742
I love you, too.

30
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,245
I love you, too.

31
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,713
I will.

32
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,782
All right.

33
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,718
What is a term of art?

34
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:26,647
- I'm sorry?
- What is a term of art?

35
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,292
Is that what
you want to talk about?

36
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,489
To talk about?

37
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,124
Let's take the mysticism
out of it, shall we, Carol?

38
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,963
Don't you think?
I'll tell you.

39
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,061
When you have some thing
which must be broached...

40
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,130
Don't I think? Did I...

41
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,142
Did I say something wrong?

42
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,644
No. I'm sorry. No.

43
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,147
You're right.
I'm somewhat rushed, as you see.

44
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,978
I'm very sorry. You're right.

45
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,984
What is a term of art?

46
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,818
It seems to mean a term which
has come through its use...

47
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,416
to mean something more specific
than the words would...

48
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,053
to someone not acquainted
with them, indicate.

49
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,824
That, I believe, is what
a term of art would mean.

50
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,330
You don't know what it means.

51
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,867
I'm not sure
I know what it means.

52
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,733
It's one of those things
that you look them up...

53
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,829
or have someone
explain them to you...

54
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,136
you say "Aha," and
then you immediately forget.

55
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,177
You don't do that.

56
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,178
- Forget things?
- Yes.

57
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,679
- Everybody does that.
- No, they don't.

58
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,181
- They don't?
- No.

59
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,615
- Everybody does that.
- Why would they do that?

60
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,550
I don't know.

61
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,747
Because
it doesn't interest them.

62
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,346
No.

63
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,857
I think so, though.

64
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,449
I'm sorry
that I was distracted.

65
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,926
You don't
have to say that to me.

66
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,623
You paid me the compliment,
or the obeisance...

67
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,995
of coming in here.

68
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,993
All right.
Sit down, please.

69
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,470
Carol, I find
that I am at a standstill.

70
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,979
- I find...
- What?

71
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,244
One moment.
In regard to your...

72
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,148
You're buying a new house.

73
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,416
- No, let's get on with it.
- Get on?

74
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,151
Believe me, I know how
potentially humiliating these...

75
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,184
I have no desire
other than to help you.

76
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,424
But... I won't even say but.

77
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,329
I'll say, as I go back...

78
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,494
- I'm just trying...
- No. It will not do.

79
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,368
- What will not do?
- Your work.

80
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,533
I sit in class. I take notes.

81
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,041
Yes, I understand.

82
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,476
What I'm trying to tell you
is that some basic...

83
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,946
One moment. Some basic
missed communication...

84
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,108
I'm doing what I'm told.
I bought your book.

85
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,412
No, I'm sure you...

86
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,477
I'm doing what I'm told.
It's difficult for me.

87
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,455
- Lots of the language...
- Please.

88
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,115
The language...
The things that you say.

89
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,422
I'm sorry, no.
I don't think that that's true.

90
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,985
It is true. Why would I...

91
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,496
I'll tell you why.

92
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,294
You're an incredibly
bright girl.

93
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,630
No! You're
an incredibly bright girl.

94
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,899
You have no problem with...
No. I'II...

95
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,963
Who's kidding who here?

96
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,475
I'll tell you why.

97
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,976
I think you're angry.

98
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,309
- Why would I...
- Wait one moment.

99
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,904
It is true. I have problems.

100
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,142
Everybody...

101
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,879
I come from a different social,
a different economic...

102
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,389
- When I came to this school...
- Yes, quite.

103
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,758
Does that mean nothing?

104
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,761
Look, look...
Here, please. Sit down.

105
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,226
Sit down.

106
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,318
"I think that the ideas
contained in this work...

107
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,877
"express the author's feelings
in a way that he intended...

108
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,718
"based on his results."

109
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,128
What can that mean?
Do you see?

110
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,629
The best that I...

111
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,255
I'm saying that perhaps
this course...

112
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,822
No, no, no, you can't.

113
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,062
- How? Carol!
- I have to pass it.

114
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,468
- I have to pass this course.
- Well, either...

115
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,872
Either the criteria for
judging progress in the class...

116
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,842
No, no, no!
I have to pass it.

117
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,173
Now, look,
I'm a human being...

118
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,507
I did what you told me.

119
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,105
I did everything.
I read your book.

120
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,047
You told me to buy your book
and read it.

121
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,313
Everything you say, I do.

122
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,820
- Look.
- Everything I'm told.

123
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,686
I'm not your father.

124
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:24,156
What?
Did I say you were my father?

125
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,926
- No.
- Why did you say that?

126
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,967
Why did you say that to me?

127
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,522
Hello. Yes. Jerry.

128
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,617
I know what time it is.

129
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:58,095
Yes, I'm trying to get
out of here, believe me.

130
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,224
Why do we need these notes?

131
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,305
You're right.
I'm going to find my notes.

132
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,111
I'll be there in ten minutes.

133
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,893
What is it you would have me do?

134
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,058
We are two people, all right?

135
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,399
Both of whom have subscribed
to certain arbitrary...

136
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,802
You have to help me.

137
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,035
Certain institutional forms.
That's right.

138
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,101
You may say
they are false or arbitrary.

139
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,703
- You have to help me.
- Excuse me one moment, please.

140
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,249
- You have to help me.
- Excuse me.

141
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,988
I've had a long day,
and it is not over yet.

142
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,580
That's not your problem.
I understand.

143
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,855
- You have to help me.
- What do you want me to do?

144
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,588
How can I go back
and tell them the grades...

145
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,928
I'm sorry for you. I am.

146
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,160
There is... you're right...

147
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,693
a harshness in
the methodology of grading.

148
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,707
But we have accepted it,
both of us.

149
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,969
And for better or worse...

150
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,672
we must abide by the system
which we have chosen...

151
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,714
don't you think?

152
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,717
I think so.
I thank you for coming in.

153
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,412
If you'd like to reschedule
an appointment...

154
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,783
with my office
for a future time...

155
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,550
I'd be happy to talk
with you then. Thank you.

156
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,830
What do you want me to do?

157
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,927
Teach me.
I want you to teach me.

158
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,472
- I tried to teach you.
- I read your book.

159
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,474
- You don't understand it.
- No.

160
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,100
Perhaps it's not well written.

161
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,737
No, no.
I want to understand it.

162
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,474
What don't you understand?

163
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,073
Any of it.

164
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,416
What you're trying to say
when you talk about...

165
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,819
Yes?

166
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,120
"Virtual warehousing
of the young."

167
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,251
Virtual warehousing
of the young.

168
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,922
If we artificially
prolong adolescence...

169
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,488
And about the curse
of modern education.

170
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:51,662
Look, it's just a course.
It's just a book.

171
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,762
No. There are people
out there...

172
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,535
people who came here to know
something they didn't know.

173
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,339
Who came here to be helped.

174
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,345
So someone
would help them...

175
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,643
to do something,
to know something.

176
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,514
What do they say?
To get on in the world.

177
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,019
How can I do that if I fail?

178
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,521
But I don't understand.

179
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,023
I don't understand
what anything means.

180
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,821
And I walk around
from morning till night...

181
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,226
with this one thought
in my head... I'm stupid.

182
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,729
No one thinks you're stupid.

183
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,029
- What am I, then?
- I think you're angry.

184
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,367
Many people are.

185
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,499
I have an appointment
I have to make...

186
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,668
an appointment
which is rather pressing.

187
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,336
Though I sympathize
with your concerns...

188
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,346
and though
I wish I had the time...

189
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,348
this was not
a previously scheduled meeting.

190
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,077
You think I'm nothing.

191
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,415
I have an appointment
with a realtor and my wife.

192
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,751
- You think I'm stupid.
- No, I certainly do not.

193
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,587
- You said it. You did.
- When? No, I never did.

194
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,093
Or never would say that
to a student.

195
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,994
You said,
"What can that mean?"

196
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,828
"What can that mean?"

197
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,162
What did that mean to you?

198
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,066
That I'm stupid
and I'll never learn.

199
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,934
That's what that meant,
and you're right.

200
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,939
But, then,
what am I doing here?

201
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,440
If you thought I...

202
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,500
Nobody wants me,
and nobody tells me anything.

203
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,842
And I sit there
in the corner in the back...

204
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,904
and everybody's talking
about this all the time...

205
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,315
and concepts and precepts and...

206
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,082
What in the world
are you talking about?

207
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,282
And I read your book...

208
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,688
and they said,
"Fine, go in that class"...

209
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,454
because you talked about
responsibility to the young.

210
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,190
I don't know what it means,
and I'm failing.

211
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,027
- Maybe...
- No, you're right.

212
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,567
I failed. Flunk me out.
It's garbage.

213
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,761
Everything I do...

214
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,667
"The ideas
contained in this work...

215
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,797
"express the author's feelings."

216
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,603
That's right.

217
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,735
I know I'm stupid.
I know what I am.

218
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,303
I know what I am, Professor.
You don't have to tell me.

219
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,008
It's pathetic, isn't it?

220
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,280
Uh-huh. Sit down.

221
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,786
Sit down, please?

222
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,287
Please, sit down.

223
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,291
- Why?
- I want to talk to you.

224
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,987
- Why?
- Just sit down, please.

225
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,494
Sit down!

226
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,531
Will you, please?

227
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,233
What?

228
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,169
I know what
you're talking about.

229
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,365
No, you don't.

230
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,408
- I think I do.
- How can you?

231
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,910
I'll tell you a story
about myself.

232
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,411
Do you mind?

233
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,005
I was raised
to think myself stupid.

234
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,515
What do you mean?

235
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,314
Just what I said.
I was brought up...

236
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,617
and my earliest and
most persistent memories...

237
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,919
are of being told
that I was stupid.

238
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,424
"You have such intelligence.

239
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,927
"Why must
you behave so stupidly?"

240
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,929
Or "Can't you understand?"

241
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,124
And I could not understand.

242
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,359
What?

243
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,766
The simplest problem
was beyond me.

244
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:38,996
It was a mystery.

245
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,529
- What was a mystery?
- How people learn.

246
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,041
How I could learn.

247
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,509
Which is what
I've been speaking of in class.

248
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,808
And, of course,
you can't hear it, Carol.

249
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,542
Of course you can't.

250
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,551
If you are told...
Listen to this...

251
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,555
If the young child is told
that he cannot understand...

252
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,490
then he takes it
as a description of himself.

253
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,992
What am I?

254
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,495
I am that
which cannot understand.

255
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,428
And I saw you back there...

256
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,795
when we were speaking
of the concept...

257
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,198
I can't understand any of them.

258
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,203
Then that's my fault.

259
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:16,207
That is not your fault.
And that is not verbiage.

260
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:20,211
That is what I firmly hold
to be the truth.

261
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,974
And I'm sorry.

262
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,143
And I owe you an apology.

263
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,515
Why?

264
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:31,647
I suppose I've had
some things on my mind.

265
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,918
We're buying a house...

266
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,256
People said
that you were stupid?

267
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,658
Yes.

268
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,253
Yes.

269
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,025
When?

270
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,431
I'll tell you when.
Through my life.

271
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,934
In my childhood.

272
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,164
Perhaps they stopped,
but I heard them continue.

273
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,728
And what did they say?

274
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,934
They said I was incompetent.
You see?

275
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,572
And when I am tested,
the feelings of my youth...

276
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,706
about the very subject
of learning come up...

277
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:02,618
and I feel
unworthy and unprepared...

278
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,317
- Yes.
- And I feel that I must fail.

279
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,383
But then you do fail.

280
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,428
You have to, don't you?

281
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,260
A pilot... flying a plane.

282
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,801
The pilot is flying the plane.

283
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,269
He thinks, "Oh, my God,
my mind's been drifting.

284
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,307
"Oh, my God, what kind of
a cursed imbecile am I...

285
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,537
"that I, with so precious
a cargo of life in my charge...

286
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,579
"would allow my attention
to wander?

287
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,204
"Why was I born?

288
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,749
"How deluded are those
who put their trust in me?"

289
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,513
Et cetera and so on.
And he crashes the plane.

290
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,646
- He could just...
- That's right.

291
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,020
"My attention
wandered for a moment."

292
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,288
"I had a thought
I did not like, but now..."

293
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,555
That's what I'm telling you.

294
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,859
"It's time
to put my attention..."

295
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,796
You see, it is not...

296
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,857
It is not magic.

297
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,836
I know in situations like these,
you will think...

298
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,839
"I must, but I can't."

299
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,034
And you will think,
"Why was I born...

300
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,667
"to be the laughingstock
of a world...

301
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,473
"in which everyone
is better than I...

302
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,241
"where I am
entitled to nothing...

303
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,043
"where I cannot learn?"

304
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,346
All right.

305
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,018
I'm never going
to get out of here today.

306
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,025
Is that what I have?

307
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,325
I don't know
if I'd put it that way.

308
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,390
Listen...

309
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,163
I'm talking to you...

310
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,137
as I would talk to my son...

311
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,140
because that's what I'd like
him to have that I never had.

312
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,144
I'm talking to you the way
I wish someone talked to me.

313
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,146
I don't know how to do it...

314
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,148
other than to be personal
with you, but...

315
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,911
Why would you want
to be personal with me?

316
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,383
You see,
that's what I'm saying.

317
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,647
We can only interpret
the behavior of others...

318
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,053
through the screen...

319
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,648
Oh, Lord.

320
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,693
...the screen we create.

321
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,089
Hello.

322
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,428
Excuse me a moment.
Hello.

323
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,933
No, I'm coming down.

324
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,936
I know I did. In a few...

325
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,869
Is he coming to the...

326
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,372
Yes, I talked to him.

327
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,375
We'll meet you at the...

328
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,877
No. I've been with a student.

329
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,879
It's going to be...

330
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,882
This is important, too.

331
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,818
Jerry's going to...
I've been with a student.

332
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,389
How can you say that?

333
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,256
I've... Look.

334
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,192
The sooner I get off,
the sooner I'll be down.

335
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,892
Isn't that evident?
I love you.

336
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,402
Listen... Listen.
I said I love you.

337
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,961
It's going to work out
with the house.

338
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,473
Because I feel that it is.

339
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,976
All right,
I'll be right down.

340
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,308
Yes, all right, I did.

341
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,577
I'm saying it yet again.
I'll be right...

342
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,278
It's going to take
as long as it takes!

343
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,822
What was that?

344
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,291
There are some problems,
as there usually are...

345
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,393
about the final agreements
for the new house.

346
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,405
You're buying a new house.

347
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,134
That's right.

348
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,076
Because of your promotion.

349
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,844
I suppose that's right.

350
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,680
Why did you stay here with me?

351
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:25,189
- Stay here?
- Yes. When you should have gone.

352
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,959
Because I like you.

353
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,963
- You like me?
- Yes.

354
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,464
Why?

355
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,830
Why?

356
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,363
Perhaps we're similar.

357
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,645
You said everyone has problems.

358
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,146
Everyone has problems.

359
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,273
- Do they?
- Certainly.

360
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,978
- You do.
- Yes.

361
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,781
What are they?

362
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,220
Well...

363
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,889
you are absolutely right.

364
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,899
I'm going to take off
the artificial stricture...

365
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,525
of teacher and student.

366
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,094
Why should my problems be any
more a mystery than your own?

367
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,944
Of course I have problems,
as you saw.

368
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,947
- With what?
- With my wife. With work.

369
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,539
Tell me.

370
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,014
Would you like a cup of tea?

371
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:13,891
As I was saying,
I came late to teaching.

372
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,433
And I found it artificial...

373
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,460
the notion of
"I know, and you do not."

374
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,099
I told you, I hated school.

375
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,006
I hated teachers.

376
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,409
I hated anyone who was
in a position of a boss...

377
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,915
because I knew...
I didn't think, mind you...

378
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,416
I knew I was going to fail.

379
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,181
Late in life,
when I got out from under...

380
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,587
when I worked my way out
of the need to fail...

381
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,319
How do you do that?

382
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,452
I'm going to tell you.

383
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,257
You have to look
at what you are...

384
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,060
and what you feel
and how you act.

385
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,694
And finally, you have to look at
how you act...

386
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,567
and say,
"If that's what I did...

387
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,072
"that must be what
I think of myself."

388
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,506
I don't understand.

389
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,840
If I fail all the time...

390
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,641
it must be that I think
of myself as a failure.

391
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,740
If I don't want to think
of myself as a failure...

392
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,945
perhaps I should begin
by succeeding now and again.

393
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,581
Look. The tests, you see...

394
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,922
which you encounter
in school...

395
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,087
in college, in life...

396
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,929
were designed for idiots
by idiots.

397
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,831
There's no need to fail at them.

398
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,426
They're not
a test of your worth.

399
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,165
They are a test of
your ability...

400
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,537
to retain and spout back
misinformation.

401
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,543
Of course you fail them.
They're nonsense.

402
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,977
No. No.

403
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,879
Yes. They're garbage.

404
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,075
They're a joke.

405
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,051
How can you say that?

406
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,054
Look at me.

407
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,555
The tenure committee.

408
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,559
The tenure committee
come to judge me.

409
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,595
The bad tenure committee.

410
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,687
The test. You see?

411
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,595
They put me to the test.

412
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,826
They had people
voting on me...

413
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,926
I wouldn't
employ to wax my car.

414
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,063
And yet I go before
the great tenure committee...

415
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,131
I have an urge to vomit...

416
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,407
to puke my badness
on the table... to show them.

417
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,608
I'm no good.
Why would you pick me?

418
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,310
They granted you tenure.

419
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,819
Oh, no. They announced it.

420
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,912
But they haven't signed.

421
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,787
You see? At any moment.

422
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,260
They might not sign.

423
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,991
The house might not go through.

424
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,698
They'll find out my dark secret.

425
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,930
What is it?

426
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,668
There isn't one.

427
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,677
But they'll find
an index of my badness.

428
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,942
- Index?
- A pointer.

429
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,813
A pointer. You see?

430
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,409
You see?

431
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:52,355
I understand you.
I know that feeling.

432
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,359
Am I entitled to my job
and my nice house...

433
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,658
and my wife, my family?
This is what I am saying.

434
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,290
That theory
of education which...

435
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,062
- I... I...
- What?

436
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,262
I want to know about my grade.

437
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,901
Of course you do.

438
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,573
- Is that bad?
- No.

439
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,742
- Is it bad that I asked you?
- No.

440
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,617
And I apologize.

441
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,852
Of course you want to know
about your grade.

442
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,951
Of course you can't
concentrate on any...

443
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,931
Wait a moment.

444
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,525
- I should go.
- I'll make you a deal.

445
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,536
You have to take the call.

446
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,037
Let it ring.
I'll make you a deal.

447
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,266
You stay here.

448
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,035
I'm going to say... Stay here.

449
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,044
I'm going to say
it was not you...

450
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,047
it was I who was
not paying attention.

451
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,583
We'll start
the whole course over.

452
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,717
Your grade is an "A."

453
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,454
Your final grade is an "A."

454
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,553
But the class is only half over.

455
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,565
Your grade for
the whole term is an "A"...

456
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,533
if you will come back
and meet with me...

457
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,399
a few more times.

458
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,734
Forget about the paper.
You didn't like it.

459
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,171
You didn't like writing it.

460
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,469
It's not important.

461
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,874
What's important is
that I awake your interest...

462
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,539
and that
I answer your questions.

463
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,912
- Let's start over.
- With what?

464
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,211
Say this is the beginning.

465
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,912
- Of what?
- The class.

466
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,581
- But we can't start over.
- I say we can.

467
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,284
- I say we can.
- But I don't believe it.

468
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,224
I know, but it's true.

469
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,592
What is the class,
but you and me?

470
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,255
There are rules.

471
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,799
Well...

472
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,331
- We'll break them.
- How can we?

473
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,734
We won't tell anybody.

474
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,238
Is that all right?

475
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,103
I say that it's fine.

476
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,370
Why would you do this for me?

477
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,105
I like you.

478
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,239
Is that so difficult
for you to...

479
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,216
There's nobody here
but you and me.

480
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,752
All right!

481
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:09,120
I did not understand
when you referred...

482
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,422
All right. Yes?

483
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,955
When you referred to "hazing."

484
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,263
You wrote in your book
about the comparative...

485
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,428
- Yes? Yes?
- The comparative...

486
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,698
- Are you checking your notes?
- Yes.

487
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,898
Tell me in your own words.

488
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,372
I want to make sure
I have it right.

489
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,669
Of course.
You want to be exact.

490
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,904
I want to know
everything that went on...

491
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,377
That's very good.

492
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,813
I was suggesting, many times
that which we wish to retain...

493
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:36,081
is retained oftentimes better
with less expenditure of effort.

494
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,384
Here it is.
You wrote of "hazing."

495
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,789
That's correct.
Now, I said "hazing."

496
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,590
It means ritualized annoyance.

497
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,757
We shove this book at you.
We say, read it.

498
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,632
You say you've read it.
I think you're lying.

499
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,931
I'll grill you.

500
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,733
And when I find out
you've lied...

501
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,207
you'll be disgraced,
and your life will be ruined.

502
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,870
It's a sick game.
Why do we do it?

503
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,971
Does it educate?
In no sense.

504
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,882
Well, then, tell me this...

505
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,885
what is higher education?

506
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,978
It is something other
than useful.

507
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,990
What is something
other than useful?

508
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,320
All right.
That's a good question.

509
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,917
It has become a ritual...

510
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,724
it has become
an article of faith...

511
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,560
that all must be subjected to.

512
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,259
Or to put it differently...

513
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,801
that all are entitled
to higher education.

514
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,633
- And my point...
- You disagree with that.

515
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,403
Let's address that.
What do you think?

516
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,307
I don't know.

517
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,710
What do you think, though?

518
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,381
I don't know.

519
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,909
I spoke of it in class.
Do you remember my example?

520
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,352
Justice.

521
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,289
Can you repeat it to me
without your notes?

522
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,620
I ask you as a favor to me...

523
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,958
so I can see
if my idea was interesting.

524
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,625
- You said justice.
- Yes...

525
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,136
That all are entitled to...

526
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,008
Yes. To a speedy trial.

527
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,373
To a fair trial.

528
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,641
But they needn't be given
a trial at all...

529
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,375
unless they stand accused.

530
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,440
Justice is their right.

531
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,179
Should they choose to avail
themselves of it...

532
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,380
they should have a fair trial.

533
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,889
It does not follow
of necessity...

534
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,687
that a person's life
is incomplete...

535
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,285
without a trial in it.
You see?

536
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:28,093
My point is,
a confusion between...

537
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,294
equity and utility arose.

538
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,861
So that we confound
the usefulness...

539
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,534
of higher education
with our granted right...

540
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,907
to equal access to the same.

541
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,913
We, in effect,
create a prejudice toward it...

542
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,414
completely independent of...

543
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,246
That it is prejudice
we should go to school?

544
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,946
- Exactly.
- How can you say that?

545
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,716
Good. That's right.

546
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,224
Speak up.
What is a prejudice?

547
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,261
An unreasoned belief.
We all are subject to it.

548
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,693
None of us is not.

549
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,628
When it is threatened
or opposed...

550
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,290
we feel anger.

551
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,530
And we feel, do we not,
as you do now?

552
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,367
- Do you not? Good.
- But how can you...

553
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,771
Yes. Let us examine. Good.

554
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,811
I believe that I'm speaking!

555
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,729
I...

556
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,975
I'm sorry
that I interrupted you.

557
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,603
- That's all right.
- You were saying?

558
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,170
I was saying...

559
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,681
I was saying...

560
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,684
how can you say
in a college class...

561
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,777
that college education
is prejudiced?

562
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,789
I said that
our predilection for it...

563
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,758
- Predilection?
- You know what that means?

564
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:05,125
- Does it mean liking?
- Yes.

565
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,131
But how can you say
that college is...

566
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,133
That's my job, don't you know?

567
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,431
- What is?
- To provoke you.

568
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,130
No.

569
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,002
Oh, yes, though.

570
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,508
- To provoke me?
- That's right.

571
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,567
- To make me mad?
- That's right.

572
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:24,081
- To force you...
- To make me mad is your job?

573
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,946
To force you to...

574
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,952
Listen...

575
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,510
Sit down.

576
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,959
When I was young,
somebody told me...

577
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,460
Are you ready?

578
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,463
The rich copulate
less often than the poor.

579
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,964
But when they do...

580
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,900
they take more of
their clothes off.

581
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,994
Years!

582
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,470
Years, mind you...

583
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,440
I would compare experiences
of my own to this dictum...

584
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,943
saying,
"Aha. This fits the norm."

585
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,003
Or "This is
a variation from it."

586
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,641
What did it mean? Nothing.

587
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,912
It was just some jerk thing
some school kid told me...

588
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,921
that took up room
inside my head.

589
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,854
Somebody told you...

590
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,917
and you hold it
as an article of faith...

591
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,122
that higher education
is an unassailable good.

592
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,630
This notion is so dear to you...

593
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,133
that when I question it,
you become angry.

594
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,192
Good, I say.

595
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,070
Are not those the very things
which we should question?

596
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,908
I say college education
since the war...

597
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,675
has become
so a matter of course...

598
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,716
and such
a fashionable necessity...

599
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,910
for those either of...

600
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,453
or aspiring to,
the new vast middle class...

601
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,319
that we espouse it
as a matter of right...

602
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,826
and have ceased to ask
what is it good for?

603
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,454
You see my point?

604
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,467
What might be some reasons for
the pursuit of higher education?

605
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,962
One... a love of learning.

606
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,305
Two... the wish for mastery
of a skill.

607
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:05,373
Three...
for economic betterment.

608
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,930
I'm keeping you.

609
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,938
One moment.
I have to make a note.

610
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,439
It's something that I said.

611
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,737
No. We're buying a house.

612
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,936
You're buying a new house?

613
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,072
To go with the tenure.
That's right.

614
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:41,448
Nice house.
Close to the private school.

615
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,953
We were speaking
of economic betterment...

616
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,786
and I was thinking
of the school tax.

617
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,052
School tax?

618
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,957
Where is it written...

619
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:56,263
that I have to send my child
to public school?

620
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,995
Is it a law...

621
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,402
that I must improve
the city's schools...

622
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:06,273
at the expense
of my own interest?

623
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,404
And is this not simply...

624
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,415
a case of...

625
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,417
quote...

626
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,478
the white man's burden?

627
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,820
End quotation.

628
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,653
Good.

629
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,299
Does this interest you?

630
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,702
No. I'm taking notes.

631
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:38,401
You don't have to take notes.
You can just listen.

632
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:42,378
I want to make sure
I remember it.

633
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,675
I'm not lecturing you.

634
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,410
I'm just telling you
some things that I think.

635
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,145
What do you think?

636
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,615
Should all kids go to college?
Why?

637
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,422
- To learn.
- But if he does not learn?

638
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,896
- Lf the child does not learn?
- Why is he in college?

639
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,966
Because he was told
it was his right?

640
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,934
Some might find college
instructive.

641
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,264
I would hope so.

642
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:09,534
How do they feel being told
they're wasting their time?

643
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,541
I don't think
I'm telling them that.

644
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,941
You said...

645
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:19,313
"Education was prolonged
and systematic hazing."

646
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,078
Yes, it can be so.

647
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,848
If education is so bad,
why do you do it?

648
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:27,049
I do it because I love it.

649
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,353
Let's...

650
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,588
I suggest...

651
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,823
you look at the demographics.

652
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,423
"Wage-earning capacity.

653
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:42,963
"College and noncollege-educated
men and women, 1855 to 1980."

654
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,975
Let's see if we can wring some
worth from these statistics...

655
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,977
- No.
- What?

656
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,570
I can't understand them...
the charts, the concepts.

657
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,876
Charts are simply a tool...

658
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,213
When I leave here...
No, I can't.

659
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,482
- You can, though.
- No, I don't understand.

660
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,318
- What?
- Any of it.

661
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,620
Any of it.
I'm smiling in class.

662
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,217
I'm smiling the whole time.
What are you talking about?

663
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,025
What is everyone talking about?
I don't understand.

664
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,430
I don't know
what it means to be here.

665
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,934
You tell me I'm intelligent...

666
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,163
then you tell me
I shouldn't be here.

667
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,568
- It's all right.
- I don't understand!

668
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,334
What do you mean?
Who should I listen to?

669
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,897
Easy!

670
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,360
I don't understand you.

671
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,465
I know. It's all right.

672
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,093
- I...
- What?

673
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,761
I...

674
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,362
- What? Tell me.
- I can't tell you.

675
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,738
- No. You must.
- I can't.

676
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,299
No. Tell me.

677
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,476
I'm bad!

678
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,182
Oh, God.

679
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,821
It's all right.

680
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm...

681
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,751
It's all right.

682
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,523
I can't talk about this.

683
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:15,930
It's all right. Tell me.

684
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,127
Why do you want to know this?

685
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,136
I don't want to know.
I want to know...

686
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,297
- I always...
- Good.

687
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,772
I always...

688
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,275
All of my life...

689
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:36,475
I have never told anyone this.

690
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:37,885
Go on.

691
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,786
Go on.

692
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,485
- All of my life...
- Yes?

693
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,470
I can't talk now.

694
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,511
What?

695
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,342
Wait a second.

696
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,644
I don't get it.

697
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,980
You talking about the realtor?

698
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,644
She said what?

699
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,956
Hold on.

700
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,431
What? She what?

701
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,492
She can't.

702
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,434
She said
the agreement is void.

703
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,941
How?
How is the agreement void?

704
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,444
That's our house.
I have the paper.

705
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,242
When we come down next week
with the payment and paper...

706
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,944
that house is...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

707
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,782
Did Jerry... Is Jerry there?

708
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,449
Is she there?
Does she have a lawyer?

709
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,688
How the hell?

710
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,958
It's a question, you said,
of the easement.

711
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,591
I don't understand.
It's not the whole agreement.

712
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,898
It's just the easement.
Why would she...

713
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,133
Put Jerry on.

714
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,911
Jerry, what the hell?

715
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,415
That's my house.
I'm not coming down.

716
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:16,044
Listen, screw her!

717
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,610
I want you to take Grace...

718
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,916
you get out of that house.

719
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,423
You leave her there,
her and her lawyer.

720
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,222
And you tell her
we'll see them in court next...

721
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,230
No, leave her there!
Leave her to stew in it.

722
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,198
You tell her
we're getting that house...

723
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,699
and we are going to...

724
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,963
No, I am not coming down.

725
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,528
I'll be damned
if I'll sit in the same...

726
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,939
You tell her next time
we see her is in court.

727
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:42,274
I... What?

728
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,813
What?

729
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,280
I don't understand.

730
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,684
What about the house?

731
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,855
There isn't any problem
with the hou...

732
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,462
No, that's all right.

733
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,466
I'II... All right.

734
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,367
Of course.

735
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,770
No. I will. Right away.

736
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,079
What is it?

737
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,357
It's a surprise party.

738
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,989
- It is?
- Yes.

739
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,725
A party for you?

740
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,495
Yes.

741
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,002
Is it your birthday?

742
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,506
- No.
- What is it?

743
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,134
The tenure announcement.

744
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,906
The tenure announcement?

745
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,345
They're throwing a party for us
in our new house.

746
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:54,213
- Your new house?
- The house that we're buying.

747
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,810
You have to go.

748
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,822
It seems that I do.

749
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,723
They're proud of you.

750
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,758
There are those who would say
it's a form of aggression.

751
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,596
What is?

752
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,727
A surprise.

753
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,492
You see, I love to teach.

754
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,587
And I flatter myself
I'm skilled at it.

755
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,962
And I love the aspect
of performance.

756
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,433
I think I must confess that.

757
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:28,596
When I found I love to teach...

758
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,663
I swore that
I would not become...

759
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,005
that cold, rigid automaton
of an instructor...

760
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,944
which I had encountered
as a child.

761
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,413
Now, I was not unconscious...

762
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,450
that it was given me
to err upon the other side.

763
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,418
And so I asked
and asked myself...

764
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,955
if I had engaged in heterodoxy...

765
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,957
I will not say gratuitously...

766
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,118
for I do not care
to posit orthodoxy...

767
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,128
as a given good...

768
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,762
But to the detriment
of my students.

769
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,631
Yes.

770
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,032
As I said...

771
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,408
when the possibility
of tenure opened...

772
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,142
and, of course,
I had long pursued it...

773
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:16,550
I was, of course,
happy and covetous of it.

774
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,584
I asked myself
if I was wrong to covet it...

775
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,926
and thought about it long
and, I hope, truthfully...

776
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,933
and saw in myself
several things...

777
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,561
in, I think,
no particular order...

778
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:37,437
and I would like
to share them with you.

779
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,342
That I would pursue it...

780
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,437
that I desired it...

781
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,449
that I was not pure of longing
for security...

782
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,884
and that perhaps
was not reprehensible in me.

783
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,251
That I had duties
beyond the school...

784
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,722
and that my duty to my home,
for instance...

785
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,589
was, or should be
if it were not...

786
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,287
of an equal weight.

787
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:03,026
That tenure and security
and, yes, and comfort...

788
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,364
were not of themselves
to be scorned...

789
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,894
and were even worthy
of honorable pursuit.

790
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,065
And that it was given me...

791
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,666
here in this place
which I enjoy...

792
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,645
and in which I find comfort
to assure myself...

793
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,911
of, as far as it rests
in the material...

794
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,419
a continuation
of that comfort and joy.

795
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,421
In exchange for what?

796
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,981
Teaching... which I love.

797
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,931
What was the price
of this security?

798
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,934
To obtain tenure,
which tenure...

799
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,061
the committee is in the process
of granting me...

800
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,537
and on the basis of which...

801
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:46,235
I contracted
to purchase a house.

802
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,946
Now.

803
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,983
As you don't have
your own family at this point...

804
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,951
you may not know
what that means...

805
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,453
but to me,
it is very important...

806
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:02,390
a home, a good home,
to raise my family.

807
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,393
Now, the tenure committee
will meet.

808
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,520
This is the process...

809
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,895
and a good process,
under which...

810
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,901
the school has functioned
for quite a long time.

811
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,904
They will meet
and hear your complaint...

812
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,906
which you have
the right to make...

813
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,874
and they will dismiss it.

814
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,376
They will dismiss
your complaint...

815
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,379
and in
the intervening period...

816
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,245
I will lose my house.

817
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,409
I will not be able
to close on my house.

818
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,419
I will lose my deposit.

819
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:34,423
And the home I picked out
for my wife and son...

820
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,959
will go by the boards.

821
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,962
I see that I have angered you.

822
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,930
I understand
your anger with teachers.

823
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,933
I was angry with mine.

824
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,561
I felt hurt
and humiliated by them...

825
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,037
which is one of the reasons
I went into education.

826
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,472
What do you want of me?

827
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,342
I was hurt when
I received the report...

828
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,811
of the tenure committee.

829
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,940
I was shocked and I was hurt.

830
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,383
Now...

831
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:06,081
I don't mean to subject you
to my weak sensibilities.

832
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,387
All right.
Finally, I did not understand.

833
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:10,892
And then I thought...

834
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,020
is it not always
at those points...

835
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,825
at which we reckon
ourselves unassailable...

836
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,298
that we are most vulnerable?

837
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,102
Yes. All right.

838
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,417
You find me pedantic.
Yes, I am.

839
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,976
By nature, by birth,
by profession.

840
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:40,683
I don't know. I'm always
looking for a paradigm.

841
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,021
I don't know
what a paradigm is.

842
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,253
It's a model.

843
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,728
Then why can't you use
that word?

844
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,433
If it is important to you, yes.

845
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,435
I was looking for a model.

846
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,961
To continue,
I feel that one point...

847
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,974
One second!

848
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,873
Upon which I am unassailable...

849
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:04,641
is my unflinching concern
for my students' dignity.

850
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,912
I have asked you here
in a spirit of investigation...

851
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,886
to ask you... to ask...

852
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,821
what have I done to you?

853
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,622
And, I suppose,
how can I make amends?

854
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,855
Can we not settle this now?

855
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,228
It's pointless, really.
And I want to know...

856
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,392
What you can do
to force me to retract.

857
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:25,799
That is not what I meant at all.

858
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,736
To bribe me,
to convince me to retract.

859
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,102
That is not what I meant at all.

860
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,697
I think you know that it is not.

861
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,538
That is not what I know.
I wish I...

862
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,804
You wish what?

863
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,903
No. You said
what amends you can make...

864
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,641
to force me to retract.

865
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:39,909
That is not what I said.

866
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,575
I have my notes.

867
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,678
Look. Look...

868
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,416
The stoics say...

869
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,014
The stoics?

870
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,683
The stoical philosophers say...

871
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,422
if you remove the phrase,
"I have been injured"...

872
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,464
you have removed the injury.

873
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,466
Now, think.
I know you're upset.

874
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,367
Just tell me, literally...

875
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,496
what wrong have I done you?

876
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,870
Whatever you have done to me...

877
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,604
to the extent
that you've done it to me...

878
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,168
rather than
to me as a student...

879
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,111
and so to the student body...

880
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,809
is contained in my report
to the tenure committee.

881
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,283
Well, all right.

882
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,486
Let's see.

883
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,919
Let's investigate this.

884
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,125
I find that I am sexist...

885
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,030
that I am elitist.

886
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,568
I'm not sure
I know what that means...

887
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,299
other than it's
a derogatory word meaning bad.

888
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:39,308
That I insist on wasting time...

889
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,402
in nonprescribed
and self-aggrandizing...

890
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,472
and theatrical diversions
from the prescribed text.

891
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,919
That these have taken both
sexist and pornographic forms.

892
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:55,925
Here we find listed instances.

893
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,621
Closeted with a student...

894
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:01,687
told a rambling,
sexually-explicit story...

895
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,926
in which the frequency
and attitudes of fornication...

896
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:09,029
of the poor and rich
are the central point.

897
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:12,439
"Moved to embrace said student."

898
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,468
That I used the phrase
"the white man's burden."

899
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,647
That I told you
how I'd asked you to my room...

900
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:23,777
because I "like you."

901
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,982
"He said he liked me,
that he liked being with me.

902
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,753
"He'd let me write
my examination paper over...

903
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:33,421
"if I could come back oftener
to see him in his office."

904
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,465
It's ludicrous.
Don't you know that?

905
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,965
It's not necessary.

906
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,867
It's going to humiliate you
and to cost me my house.

907
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,962
It's ludicrous?

908
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,600
"He told me he had problems
with his wife...

909
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,869
"and that he wanted
to take off...

910
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,275
"the artificial stricture
of teacher and student.

911
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,143
"He put his arms around..."

912
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,647
Do you deny it?

913
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,810
Can you deny it?
Don't you see?

914
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,012
You don't see, do you?

915
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,384
I don't see.

916
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,219
You think that you can deny
that these things happened...

917
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,282
or if they did...

918
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,453
that they meant
what you said they meant.

919
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,588
Don't you see?
You dragged me in here...

920
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:11,532
You drag us to listen to you
go on about this or that...

921
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,762
or we don't express
ourselves very well.

922
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,601
We don't say what we mean,
don't we?

923
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:17,970
We do say what we mean...

924
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,906
and you say
"I don't understand you" and...

925
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,841
Consult the report?
You see?

926
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,311
Do you see what I'm saying?

927
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,371
Can't you tell me
in your own words?

928
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,679
Those are my own words.

929
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,284
"He told me that if
I would stay alone with him...

930
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,119
"in his office, he would
change my grade to an "A."

931
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,456
What have I done to you?

932
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,893
Oh, my God!
Are you so hurt?

933
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,794
What I feel is irrelevant.

934
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,059
Do you know I tried to help you?

935
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,896
What I know I have reported.

936
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,459
I would like to help you now,
before this escalates.

937
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,834
I don't need your help.

938
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,202
I don't need anything
that you have.

939
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,470
- I feel...
- I don't care what you feel.

940
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,341
You can't do that anymore.
You do not have the power.

941
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,574
Did you misuse it?
Someone did.

942
00:51:58,648 --> 00:51:59,842
Are you part of that group?

943
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,474
Yes, you are.
You've done these things.

944
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,519
And to say, "Excuse me."

945
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,647
And to say, "Let me help
you with your problem..."

946
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,918
Yes, I understand.

947
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,823
You're hurt. You're angry.

948
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,919
I think your anger
is betraying you...

949
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,430
down a path
which helps no one.

950
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,433
I don't care what you think.

951
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,527
You don't?
But you talk of rights.

952
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:22,936
Don't you see?
I have rights, too.

953
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,440
I have a house,
part of the real world...

954
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,774
and the tenure committee.
Good men and true.

955
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,574
- Professor...
- Please.

956
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,582
Also part of that world.
You understand?

957
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,141
This is my life.
I'm not a boogie man.

958
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,516
I don't stand for something...

959
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,454
Professor,
I came here as a favor...

960
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:41,957
at your personal request.

961
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,458
Perhaps I should not
have done so...

962
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,963
but I did on my behalf
and on behalf of my group.

963
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,588
And you speak of
the tenure committee...

964
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,758
one of whose members
is a woman...

965
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,631
and though you might
call it good fun...

966
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,432
or an historical phrase
or an oversight...

967
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,872
to refer to the committee
as good men and true...

968
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,910
it is a demeaning remark.

969
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,410
It is a sexist remark...

970
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:05,414
and to overlook it is
to countenance continuation...

971
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,710
of that method of thought.

972
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,809
- It's a remark...
- Oh, come on!

973
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:13,287
Come on! Sufficient
to deprive a family...

974
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,516
Sufficient?

975
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,923
Sufficient, yes.
It is a fact.

976
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,927
And that story
which I quote...

977
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,929
is vile and classist
and manipulative...

978
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,624
and pornographic...

979
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,064
It's pornographic?

980
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,796
What gives you the right
to speak to a woman...

981
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,905
Yes, I'm sorry.

982
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,443
I'm sorry
you feel yourself empowered.

983
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,978
You say so yourself...

984
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,174
to strut, to posture,
to perform.

985
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:42,184
You say that higher education
is a joke...

986
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,947
and treat it as such.

987
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,648
You treat it as such
and confess to a taste...

988
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,624
to play the patriarch
in your class...

989
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,957
to grant this, to deny that...

990
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,495
to embrace your students.

991
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,464
How can you assert?
How can you stand there?

992
00:53:56,533 --> 00:54:00,765
How can you deny it?
You did it to me here.

993
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,270
You did. You confess.

994
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,772
You love the power...

995
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,400
to deviate, to invent,
to transgress...

996
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,968
to transgress whatever norms
have been established for us.

997
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:13,015
And you think it's charming
to question in yourself...

998
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,381
this taste to mock and destroy.

999
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:19,081
But to the aspirations
of your students...

1000
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,988
of hard-working students
who come here...

1001
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,889
who slave to come here...

1002
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,421
You have no idea what it cost me
to come to this school.

1003
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,933
You mock us.

1004
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,470
You call education hazing...

1005
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,472
and from your so-protected,
so-elitist seat...

1006
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,202
you hold our confusion
as a joke...

1007
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,302
and our hopes and efforts
with it.

1008
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,506
Then you sit there and say,
"What have I done?"

1009
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:48,950
And ask me to understand
that you have aspirations, too.

1010
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,510
But I tell you...

1011
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,920
I tell you that you are vile...

1012
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,686
and that you are exploitative...

1013
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,526
and if you possess one ounce
of that inner honesty...

1014
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,087
you describe in your book...

1015
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:06,602
you can look in yourself and
see those things that I see...

1016
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,162
and you can find revulsion
equal to my own. Good day.

1017
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,867
Wait a second, will you?
Just one moment.

1018
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,238
Nice day today.

1019
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,844
What?

1020
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,473
You said good day.

1021
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,017
I think that it is
a nice day today.

1022
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,110
- Is it?
- Yes, I think it is.

1023
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,552
Why is that important?

1024
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,487
Because...

1025
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,993
it's the essence
of all human communication.

1026
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,552
I say something conventional,
you respond...

1027
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,928
and the information we exchange
is not about the weather...

1028
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,933
but that we agree to converse.

1029
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,970
In effect, we agree
that we are both human.

1030
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,834
I am not an exploiter...

1031
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:46,933
and you are not a deranged,
what, revolutionary?

1032
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,444
That we may have positions...

1033
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,946
and that we may have desires
which are in conflict...

1034
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,949
but that we're just human...

1035
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,451
that means sometimes
we're imperfect.

1036
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,817
Often, we're in conflict.

1037
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,446
Much of what we do...
you're right...

1038
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,458
in the name of principles
is self-serving.

1039
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,494
Much of what we do
is conventional.

1040
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,052
You're right.

1041
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:11,567
You said you came into the class
to learn about education.

1042
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,625
I don't know that
I can teach you about education.

1043
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,968
But I know I can tell you
what I think about education...

1044
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,304
and then you decide.

1045
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,003
And you don't have
to fight with me.

1046
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,068
I'm not the subject.

1047
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,547
And where I am wrong...

1048
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:30,651
perhaps it's not your job
to fix me.

1049
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,381
I know I don't want to fix you.

1050
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,184
I would like to tell you
what I think...

1051
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,418
because that is my job...

1052
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:40,395
conventional though it is,
and flawed as I may be.

1053
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,561
And then...

1054
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,936
if you can show me
some better form...

1055
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,441
then we can proceed from there.

1056
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,673
But just like,
"Nice day, isn't it?"...

1057
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,941
I don't think we can proceed...

1058
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,712
until we accept
that each of us is human...

1059
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,651
and we can
still have difficulties.

1060
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,451
We will have them.
That's all right, too.

1061
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:08,991
- Now...
- Wait.

1062
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,894
Yes, I want to hear it.

1063
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,226
The...

1064
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,164
Yes, tell me frankly.

1065
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,394
My position...

1066
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,960
I want to hear it
in your own words...

1067
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,403
what you want, what you feel...

1068
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,964
My group.

1069
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,703
Your group?

1070
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:38,613
The people
I've been talking to, they...

1071
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,622
There's no shame in that.

1072
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,624
Everybody needs advisors.

1073
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,217
Everybody needs
to expose themselves...

1074
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,421
to various points of view.

1075
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,932
It's not wrong.
It's essential.

1076
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,466
Good.

1077
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:55,402
Good. Now.

1078
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,939
You and I...

1079
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,970
You and I.

1080
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,764
Hello?

1081
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:30,397
No. I know they do.

1082
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:34,500
I know she does.
Tell her that I...

1083
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,408
Can I call you back?

1084
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:40,415
No. Then tell her
I think it's going to be fine.

1085
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:43,919
Tell her just hold on, and I...

1086
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:46,421
Can I get back to you?

1087
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:47,820
Well, no, no, no.

1088
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,519
We're taking the house.
No, no, no.

1089
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,427
It's not a question
of refunding the deposit.

1090
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:57,660
Yes, I know the committee
is about to meet.

1091
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,168
I'm dealing with the complaint.

1092
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:04,434
Yes, right now.
Which is why I...

1093
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,941
Call Jerry.
And I can't talk now.

1094
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,240
Fine. Good-bye.

1095
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,955
I'm sorry
that we were interrupted.

1096
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,294
- One moment.
- I was saying...

1097
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,391
You said that we should agree
to talk about my complaint.

1098
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:35,266
- That's correct.
- But we are talking about it.

1099
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,774
That's correct, too.
This is the gist of education...

1100
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,241
We're talking about it
at the tenure committee hearing.

1101
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,539
Yes, but I'm saying...

1102
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,409
We can talk about it
now as easily...

1103
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,072
No. I think we should
stick to the process...

1104
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,343
Wait a minute.

1105
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,181
The conventional process,
as you said.

1106
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:54,622
And you're right.
I'm sorry if I was...

1107
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,682
If I was discourteous to you.
You're right.

1108
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,728
- Wait a moment.
- I really should go.

1109
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,923
Granted, I have an interest
in the status quo.

1110
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,727
All right. Everybody does.

1111
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,030
But what I'm saying
is that the committee...

1112
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,128
Professor, you're right.
Just don't impinge on me.

1113
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,298
- We'll take our differences...
- Look, you're going...

1114
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:12,705
I shouldn't have come here.
They told me...

1115
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,640
Wait one moment. No, no!

1116
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,202
There are norms here.
And there's no reason...

1117
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,804
I'm trying to save you...

1118
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,441
You're trying to save me?
Do me the courtesy...

1119
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,917
I am doing you the courtesy.
I'm talking straight to you.

1120
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,682
We can settle this now.

1121
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:28,280
- I want you to sit down.
- You must excuse me.

1122
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,656
No, just sit down!

1123
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:34,788
It seems each of us...
Wait one moment.

1124
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,126
- Let me go!
- Just do me the courtesy!

1125
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,723
Let me go!
Get your hands off me!

1126
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,427
What are you getting
so excited about?

1127
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:40,730
Will somebody help me please?

1128
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,828
Will you please?

1129
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,736
Would somebody help me,
please!

1130
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:51,371
Can I speak to you
for a moment, please?

1131
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,469
OK.

1132
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,657
Excuse me.

1133
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,993
Can you make
a large-sized poster?

1134
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,015
I... I...

1135
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,856
I have asked you here...

1136
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:23,092
I have asked you here
against my...

1137
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,100
I was most surprised
you asked me here.

1138
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,601
Against my better judgment.

1139
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:30,730
- I was most surprised.
- Yes, I'm sure.

1140
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,674
If you would like me to leave,
I'll go right now.

1141
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,769
Let us begin correctly.
May we? I feel...

1142
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,007
That is what I wish to do.
That's why I came here...

1143
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,776
but now perhaps
you'd like me to leave.

1144
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,944
I don't want you to leave!
I asked you to come.

1145
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,988
I didn't have to come here.

1146
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,455
No.

1147
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,048
Thank you.

1148
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,467
All right.

1149
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:04,438
Although I feel it profits...

1150
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,134
that it would
profit you something...

1151
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,269
- What I...
- lf you would hear me out!

1152
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,642
I came here to.

1153
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:13,011
The court officers
told me not to come.

1154
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,243
- The court officers?
- I'm shocked that you asked.

1155
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,685
But I did not come here
to hear what it profits me.

1156
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,450
- The court officers?
- Perhaps I should leave.

1157
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,652
- I shouldn't have...
- Wait! Wait a moment!

1158
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,160
Will you please?

1159
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:30,461
What is it you want?

1160
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,091
I would like you to stay.

1161
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:33,635
You want me to stay.

1162
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,136
- Yes.
- You do.

1163
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,866
I would like you to hear me out.
If you would.

1164
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,307
Would you? Please.

1165
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,868
If you would do that,
I would be in your debt.

1166
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:48,783
Thank you.

1167
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,954
What is it
you wish to tell me?

1168
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:55,957
I cannot...

1169
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:59,222
I cannot help but feel
you are owed an apology.

1170
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:04,090
I have read and reread
these accusations...

1171
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,565
What accusations?

1172
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:09,662
The tenure commit...
What other accusations?

1173
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,072
The tenure committee?
Those are not accusations.

1174
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,667
They have been proved.
They are facts.

1175
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,872
Those are not accusations.

1176
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:20,677
- Those?
- The committee has...

1177
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,617
Those are not accusations.
The tenure committee has...

1178
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,586
All right, all right!

1179
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:56,440
Hello. Yes.

1180
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,955
No, I'm here. Tell Mis...

1181
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,887
No, I have no time to...

1182
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,394
I'm sure he has,
but I'm fine.

1183
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,429
No, I have no time...

1184
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:10,488
Tell Mis... Tell Mister...

1185
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:15,435
Tell Jerry that I'm fine
and I'll call him right away.

1186
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,472
My wife. Yes.

1187
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,474
I'm sure she has. Yes.

1188
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:20,975
Thank you. Yes.

1189
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:22,977
I'll call her, too.

1190
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,343
I cannot talk to you now.

1191
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,432
All right.
It was good of you to come.

1192
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,934
Thank you.

1193
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,937
I have studied...

1194
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,940
I have spent some time
studying the indictment.

1195
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,670
You'll have to explain
that word to me.

1196
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,939
- An indictment?
- Yes.

1197
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,844
Is a bill of particulars...

1198
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:01,109
- All right. Yes.
- In which is alleged...

1199
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,651
No. I cannot allow that.

1200
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,586
Nothing is alleged.
Everything is proved.

1201
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:09,385
- Please, wait a second.
- I cannot allow that.

1202
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,653
If I may? From whatever
you feel is established...

1203
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,854
The issue here
is not what I feel.

1204
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,294
It is not my feelings...

1205
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,458
but the feelings of women
and men, your superiors...

1206
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,126
who have been polled...

1207
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,295
and have ruled
that you are negligent...

1208
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,636
that you are guilty and
are not to be given tenure...

1209
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,642
that you are to be disciplined.

1210
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,144
That is what
the tenure committee has said.

1211
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,978
That is what my lawyer said,
for what you did in class...

1212
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,915
for what you did in that office.

1213
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:38,419
They're going to discharge me.

1214
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,512
As full well they should!

1215
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,427
You don't understand. Fine.

1216
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,258
What has led you to this point?

1217
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,992
Not your sex, not your race,
not your class.

1218
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,126
Your own actions.
And you're angry.

1219
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,999
You ask me here.
What do you want?

1220
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:58,199
You want to charm me.
You want to convince me.

1221
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:01,437
You want me to recant.
I will not recant.

1222
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,943
Why should I?
What I say is right.

1223
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:06,948
You were going to tell me that
you have a wife and child...

1224
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,950
that you have a career...

1225
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,953
and that you've worked
for 20 years for this.

1226
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,955
Do you know
what you've worked for?

1227
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,959
Power! For power.
Do you understand?

1228
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:21,463
And you sit there and tell me
stories about your house...

1229
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,691
and all about private schools
and privilege...

1230
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:27,463
and how you are entitled
to buy, to spend...

1231
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:31,472
to mock, to summon.
All your stories.

1232
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,545
All your silly, weak guilt.

1233
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,915
It's all about privilege...

1234
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,318
and you won't know it.
Don't you see?

1235
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,221
You've worked twenty years
for the right to insult me.

1236
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,727
And you feel entitled
to be paid for it.

1237
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,228
Your home, your wife...

1238
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,230
your sweet deposit
on your house.

1239
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,528
Don't you have feelings?

1240
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,796
That's my point, you see...

1241
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,633
"Don't you have feelings?"

1242
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,138
Your final argument...

1243
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:07,403
I don't take your side,
you question if I'm human.

1244
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,841
Don't you have feelings?

1245
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,344
I have a responsibility...

1246
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:13,074
- To?
- This institution.

1247
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,980
To the students, to my group.

1248
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,540
- Your group?
- Yes.

1249
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:20,646
Because I speak, not for myself,
but for the group.

1250
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,918
For those who suffer
what I suffer...

1251
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,654
on behalf of whom,
even if I were inclined to...

1252
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:30,529
Forgive? Forget?
Overlook your...

1253
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,534
- My behavior?
- It would be wrong.

1254
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,229
Even if you were inclined
to forgive me?

1255
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,772
- It would be wrong.
- And what would transpire?

1256
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,034
- Transpire?
- Yes.

1257
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:40,769
- Happen?
- Yes.

1258
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,708
Then say it,
for Christ's sake!

1259
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,837
Who the hell
do you think that you are?

1260
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,212
You want a post...

1261
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,810
you want unlimited power
to do and say what you want...

1262
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:53,514
as it pleases you...
testing, questioning...

1263
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,022
- Flirting...
- I never...

1264
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,558
Excuse me one moment, will you?

1265
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:07,868
"The 12th.
Have a good day, dear."

1266
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:12,365
"The 15th.
Now, don't you look fetching."

1267
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:16,377
"April 17th. If you girls
would come over here..."

1268
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:18,913
I saw you.

1269
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:22,075
I saw you, Professor,
for the entire semester...

1270
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,743
sit there, stand there...

1271
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:27,084
and exploit
your paternal prerogative.

1272
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,216
And what is that but rape,
I swear to God?

1273
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:35,363
You asked me in here
to explain something to me...

1274
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,365
that I did not understand...

1275
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:40,027
but I came here to explain
something to you.

1276
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,036
You are not God.

1277
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,538
You ask me why I came?

1278
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,575
I came here to instruct you.

1279
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,636
And your book.

1280
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:53,546
You want to talk about
your book?

1281
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,585
You think you're going
to show me some light?

1282
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,516
You maverick,
outside of tradition.

1283
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,817
No, no...

1284
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:05,155
of that fine tradition
of inquiry...

1285
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,320
of polite skepticism.

1286
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:11,765
And you say you believe in
free intellectual discourse?

1287
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,734
You believe in nothing.

1288
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,895
You believe in nothing at all.

1289
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:18,405
I believe in freedom of thought.

1290
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,169
Isn't that fine? Do you?

1291
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,402
Yes, I do.

1292
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,342
Then why do you question
for one moment...

1293
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,937
the committee's decision
refusing your tenure?

1294
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,449
Why do you question
your suspension?

1295
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,577
You believe in what
you call freedom of thought...

1296
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:32,848
then fine.

1297
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,049
You believe in freedom
of thought and a home...

1298
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,356
and prerogatives
for your kid and tenure.

1299
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:40,656
And I'm going to tell you...

1300
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,890
that you believe not
in freedom of thought...

1301
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,398
but in an elitist...

1302
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,902
in a protected hierarchy
which rewards you.

1303
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,872
And for whom you are the clown.

1304
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:56,536
You mock and exploit the system
which pays your rent.

1305
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,102
You're wrong.

1306
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,647
I'm not wrong.

1307
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,750
You're wrong.

1308
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,253
You think
that I'm full of hatred.

1309
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,695
I know what you think I am.

1310
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:16,890
Do you?

1311
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,399
Of course I do.

1312
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:23,234
You think I'm a frightened,
repressed, confused...

1313
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:26,900
abandoned young thing of
some doubtful sexuality...

1314
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:29,876
who wants power and revenge,
don't you?

1315
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,313
Yes, I do.

1316
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:37,351
Isn't that better?

1317
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:40,354
And I feel that
that is the first moment...

1318
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:43,118
which you've treated me
with respect.

1319
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,626
For you told me the truth.

1320
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:49,596
I did not come here,
as you are assured, to gloat.

1321
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:50,927
Why would I want to gloat?

1322
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:54,628
I've profited nothing from,
as you say, your misfortune.

1323
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,762
I came here...

1324
01:12:56,839 --> 01:13:00,798
as you did me the honor
to ask me here.

1325
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,310
I came here
to tell you something...

1326
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,041
If I may...

1327
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,582
that I think...

1328
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:11,552
that I think you've been wrong.

1329
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,885
That I think
you've been terribly wrong.

1330
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,084
Do you hate me now?

1331
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:20,492
- Yes.
- Listen to me, Professor.

1332
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,996
It is the power
that you hate so deeply...

1333
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,364
that any atmosphere of
free discussion is impossible.

1334
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:29,370
It's not unlikely.
It's impossible, isn't it?

1335
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:32,532
- Isn't it?
- Yes, I suppose.

1336
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,542
Now the thing
which you find so cruel...

1337
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,805
is the self-same process
of selection...

1338
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:40,747
that I and my group go through
every day of our lives...

1339
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:41,942
in admittance to school...

1340
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:44,212
in our tests,
in our class rankings.

1341
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,925
You write that education
is just hazing.

1342
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,962
But we work
to get to this school...

1343
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:55,724
and some of us
overcame prejudices...

1344
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:59,234
economic, sexual...
you cannot begin to imagine...

1345
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:03,101
and endured humiliations that
I pray you and those you love...

1346
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,471
never will encounter
to gain admittance here...

1347
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:10,774
to pursue that same dream
of security you pursue...

1348
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:11,972
we, who are at any moment...

1349
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,982
in danger of
being deprived of it.

1350
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,176
By?

1351
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:18,981
By the administration,
by the teachers, by you.

1352
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:23,150
By one low grade that keeps us
out of graduate school.

1353
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:26,422
By one capricious or
inventive answer on our parts...

1354
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:28,759
which perhaps
you don't find amusing.

1355
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:32,323
I don't understand!

1356
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:34,961
My charges are not trivial.

1357
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:38,336
You see that in the haste
with which they were accepted.

1358
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,602
A joke you have told
with a sexist tinge.

1359
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,837
The language you use.

1360
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,778
A verbal or physical caress.
Yes, I know.

1361
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,112
You say it's meaningless.
I understand.

1362
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,912
I differ from you.

1363
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,953
To lay a hand
on someone's shoulder...

1364
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,147
It was devoid
of sexual content...

1365
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:57,818
I say it was not!

1366
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:00,327
Don't you begin to see,
to understand...

1367
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,193
that it is not for you to say.

1368
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,698
I take your point.

1369
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:07,701
I see there is much good
in what you refer to.

1370
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,031
Do you think so?

1371
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:12,540
But, not to say that I cannot
change in those things...

1372
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,200
where I am deficient, but...

1373
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,709
Do you hold yourself harmless...

1374
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,438
from the charge of
sexual exploitativeness?

1375
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,346
I have to tell you...

1376
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:24,351
as I said, I think
I am not too old to learn.

1377
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:25,852
And I can learn.

1378
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,354
Do you hold yourself innocent?

1379
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,050
Wait, wait, wait!
Let's go back...

1380
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,456
No! You fool!

1381
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,621
Who do you think I am,
to be taken in by a smile?

1382
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,961
You little yapping fool.
You think I want revenge?

1383
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,434
I don't want revenge.
I want understanding.

1384
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,494
- Do you?
- I do.

1385
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:48,102
What's the use? It's over.

1386
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,379
Is it? What is?

1387
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:56,977
My job.

1388
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:02,920
Your job.

1389
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:05,960
That's what
you want to talk about.

1390
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:36,223
All right.
What if it were possible...

1391
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,384
my group withdraws
its complaint?

1392
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,428
- What?
- That's right.

1393
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:43,558
Why?

1394
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:46,157
Let's say,
as an act of friendship.

1395
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,895
- An act of friendship?
- Yes.

1396
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,335
In exchange for what?

1397
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,167
Yes, but I don't think
an exchange...

1398
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,673
for what do we derive from it?

1399
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:54,868
- Derive?
- Yes.

1400
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,240
- Nothing.
- That's right.

1401
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:57,903
We derive nothing.
Do you see that?

1402
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,278
- Yes.
- That's a little word.

1403
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,442
"Yes-I-see-that,"
but you will.

1404
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,587
You might speak
to the committee?

1405
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,089
To the committee?

1406
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:11,022
Yes.

1407
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,823
Of course that's on your mind,
we might.

1408
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,055
If what?

1409
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,792
Given what?
That is more friendly.

1410
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,231
Given what?

1411
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,702
And, believe me,
I understand your rage.

1412
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:23,965
It's not that
I don't feel it...

1413
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,597
but I do not see
that it is deserved...

1414
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,666
so I do not resent it.

1415
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,439
All right. I have a list.

1416
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:31,945
A list.

1417
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:35,848
Here is a list of books
which we find questionable.

1418
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:40,418
What?

1419
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,753
- Is this so bizarre?
- I can't believe...

1420
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,758
It's not necessary
you believe it.

1421
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,590
- Academic freedom...
- Someone chooses the books.

1422
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,324
If you can choose them,
others can.

1423
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:52,094
- What are you, God?
- No. The dangerous...

1424
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,567
You have an agenda.
We have an agenda.

1425
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,433
I'm not interested
in your feelings...

1426
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,564
or your motivation,
but your actions.

1427
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,108
If you would like me to speak
to the tenure committee...

1428
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,438
here is my list.

1429
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,173
You are a free person.
You decide.

1430
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:13,214
I think you'll find...

1431
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:15,756
I'm capable of reading it,
thank you.

1432
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:17,655
We have a number of texts
we need reviewed.

1433
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,057
I see that.

1434
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,992
We're amenable
to anything that...

1435
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,361
- Let me look over...
- I think you should...

1436
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:26,924
I'm reading your demands,
all right?

1437
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,884
You want to ban my book.

1438
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,886
- We do not.
- It says here...

1439
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:47,251
We want it
removed from inclusion...

1440
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,950
as a representative example
of the university.

1441
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,151
Get out of here.

1442
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:52,523
If you put aside
the issue of personality...

1443
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:54,653
Get the fuck out of my office!

1444
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,027
I would reconsider.

1445
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,623
- You think that you can...
- We can, and we will.

1446
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,225
Do you want our support?
That is the only question.

1447
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:02,702
- To ban my book?
- That is correct.

1448
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:06,229
- This is a university.
- And we have a statement.

1449
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,434
We have a statement.

1450
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:11,036
No! It's out of the question!

1451
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,978
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1452
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:14,481
I don't know
what was I thinking of.

1453
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:15,811
I'll tell you something.

1454
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:18,478
I'm a teacher.

1455
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,521
It's my name on the door...

1456
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,489
and I teach the class.
That's what I do.

1457
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,855
I have a book
with my name on it...

1458
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:27,986
and my son will see
that book someday.

1459
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,894
And I have a respons...

1460
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,732
No. I'm sorry.
I have a responsibility...

1461
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:38,170
to myself, to my son,
to my profession.

1462
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,366
I haven't been home
for two days.

1463
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,705
You know that?
Thinking this out.

1464
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,142
You haven't?

1465
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:46,908
If it's of interest you,
I've been in a hotel thinking.

1466
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,916
You haven't been home.

1467
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,542
Thinking, you see?

1468
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,918
And I owe you a debt.
I see that now.

1469
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,217
You're dangerous.

1470
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,657
You're wrong and it is my job
to say no to you.

1471
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,922
And that is my job.
That's right.

1472
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:02,463
You're absolutely right.

1473
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,055
You want to ban my book?

1474
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,566
You can go to hell.

1475
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,263
And they can do to me
whatever they want.

1476
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:11,464
You haven't been home
in two days.

1477
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,064
I think I told you that.

1478
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:16,235
You better get that phone.

1479
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,209
I think that
you should pick up the phone.

1480
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,864
Yes.

1481
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:39,366
Yes.

1482
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:44,064
Well, I had to be...
Did you worry about me?

1483
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,707
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine, Jerry.

1484
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:50,472
I got a little bit mixed up...

1485
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,412
but I'm sitting here
and I got it figured out.

1486
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,381
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

1487
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,010
I got a little bit
turned around...

1488
01:20:58,086 --> 01:20:59,519
but I'm sitting here...

1489
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,523
and I'm not sure
it's not a blessing.

1490
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,183
Cost me my job, fine.

1491
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,988
Then the job
was not worth having.

1492
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:08,529
Tell Grace I'm coming home.
Everything's fine.

1493
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,335
What? What do you mean?

1494
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,669
Jerry...

1495
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,039
Jerry, they... Who? Who?

1496
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,237
What can they do?

1497
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,775
They can't do that.

1498
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:31,749
But how?

1499
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:36,451
She's... She's here with me.

1500
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,727
Jerry...

1501
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,565
Jerry, I don't underst...

1502
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,827
What does this mean?

1503
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:52,763
I thought you knew.

1504
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,639
What? What does it mean?

1505
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:01,715
You tried to rape me.

1506
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,808
According to the law.

1507
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:07,114
What?

1508
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,520
You tried to rape me.

1509
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,424
I was leaving this office.
You pressed yourself into me.

1510
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:14,428
You pressed your body into me.

1511
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:18,796
My group has told your lawyer
we may pursue criminal charges.

1512
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:21,335
Under the statute,
I'm told, it was battery.

1513
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,597
No.

1514
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:24,866
Yes. And attempted rape.
That's right.

1515
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:36,049
Get out.

1516
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:41,153
Of course, I thought you knew.

1517
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,253
I have to talk to my lawyer.

1518
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,693
Yes, perhaps you should.

1519
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:01,534
Hello. I...

1520
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,669
Hello. I...

1521
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,407
Yes, he just called.

1522
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,483
I can't talk now, baby.

1523
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:16,253
- Get out.
- Your wife?

1524
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:17,951
Who it is
is no concern of yours.

1525
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:19,391
Get out.

1526
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:23,894
I can't talk now, baby.

1527
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:29,801
No, no, no.
It's going to be fine.

1528
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:32,606
Get out of here!

1529
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,608
- I'm going.
- Good.

1530
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:36,803
And don't call your wife "baby."

1531
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:39,974
What?

1532
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:43,484
Don't call your wife "baby."
You heard what I said.

1533
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:45,678
You find that amusing?

1534
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:53,250
No!

1535
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:55,387
You vicious little bitch!

1536
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:57,294
Come here. Come here.

1537
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,297
Get...

1538
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:06,873
- Come here!
- No!

1539
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:10,433
You think that you can...

1540
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:13,379
destroy my life
after how I've treated you!

1541
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,143
Are you kidding me?

1542
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:20,788
Yes? Yes?

1543
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:24,822
Come here!

1544
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:32,065
Rape you?

1545
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:41,742
Rape you?
Are you kidding me?

1546
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:46,302
I wouldn't touch you
with a 10-foot...

1547
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:51,919
- You little cunt!
- Don't! Don't!

1548
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:23,143
Oh, my God.

1549
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,268
Oh, my God.

1550
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:49,877
Yes, that's right.
