1
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:14,236
That chick is so hot.

2
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,707
Yeah man.

3
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:38,693
You guys hungry??

4
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,225
Aw God, Bob.
What the hell is that smell?

5
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,593
- It wasn't me, I swear.
- What're you guys talking about?

6
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:07,347
Could you at least crack
a window or something?  God!

7
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,133
- Ooohl stop, stop, stop!
- What?!

8
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,262
Wow!

9
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:58,742
Shit...   Hey, what's happening?
You want a lift or something?

10
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,152
What's up?   I'm Jimmy.

11
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:49,408
Hi.

12
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:01,641
Hey. What's your name?

13
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:10,002
So uh...  What are you doing
all alone out there tonight, huh?

14
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,502
Are you okay?

15
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,628
What the hell?

16
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,584
Awwww... I can't believe this.

17
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:19,134
Well, you better believe it Jack,
'cause it took all damn day.

18
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,517
Ah. Looks like it was under water.

19
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:26,503
Another one from the quarry?

20
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,843
Yeah, the DEP, they cleaned that place out
and they threw everything back here.

21
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,861
I hope you can get
some parts out of this, Jack.

22
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:37,880
Well, let's haul it to the shop
and see what we can salvage.

23
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,506
Sounds good to me.

24
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:43,122
Doesn't look like you're going to
get anything off of this thing.

25
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,830
- Ugh, God!
- What the hell is that thing?

26
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:51,967
Uff!

27
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,186
You guys want to
stop by for some dinner?

28
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:01,461
Nah.

29
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,977
What do you want me
to do with the car?

30
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,273
Want me to get the tow truck?

31
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,182
Ah... leave it for a couple more days.
It's not going anywhere.

32
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,118
Alright, come get me when you need me...
if your truck can make it to my house.

33
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,236
Very funny, Earl.

34
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:21,946
Come on, Max. Let's go.

35
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,076
Well, I think I'm gonna run down
and take a look at that wreck

36
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:31,282
that Earl and I pulled
out of the swamp today.

37
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:34,816
Jack, you can't possibly have enough light
out there with just those barrels.

38
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:38,075
I know. I gotta string some power
down there one of these days.

39
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:39,685
Yeah you do.
- Mm.

40
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,276
And did you remember?
Rocker's coming to see us this weekend?

41
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,453
Ahh.  No... I completely forgot.

42
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,552
You know how
he loves his uncle Jack.

43
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:51,565
Mm, alright, alright, alright.  It'll wait
another day, that thing's going nowhere.

44
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,212
Good.   Good.

45
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:57,268
Ah-ah!  Take that stinky thing
out of here--on the porch!

46
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:01,266
And while you're at it, give Max
some food and a little bit of water.

47
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,777
Yes, dear. Good chow, honey.
Thanks.

48
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:14,247
Hey Max.  How you doing buddy?
I brought you out some water.

49
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:18,740
Thirsty, huh?
That a boy.  Have a drink.

50
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:19,983
No?  Alright.

51
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:23,079
Now, I'm just gonna
sit here with you a bit.

52
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,891
I'm not allowed to smoke
these stinkers in the house anymore.

53
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:38,139
Max!

54
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,056
Max!

55
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,639
Hell with ya.

56
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,544
Uh...

57
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,610
- Sorry, Ker.
- Thanks guys.

58
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,085
Oh. My ass...

59
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,981
I feel like I've been
trapped in a dorm room for ten years.

60
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:52,598
Yeah it's uh... charming.
Very rustic.

61
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:59,142
I gotta say, Veronica, now that l see it,
 I still don't get it!

62
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:00,421
Get what?

63
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:03,646
Why are we in East
Bumblefuck Connecticut for spring break

64
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,317
while everybody else I know is in Acapulco?

65
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:08,688
If you wanted to spend
the week with your frat boys

66
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,370
then why did you decide to come?

67
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,316
Because your life would be
boring without me.

68
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:16,862
- Right.
- And because you asked me to.

69
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,515
Yeah... right.

70
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:24,873
Still haven't given up, have you?

71
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:28,969
What can I say, man.
Life is all about the ass.

72
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,224
Covering it.

73
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,357
Kissing It.

74
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:34,611
And getting it!

75
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:36,071
Well said.

76
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:37,847
Thank you.

77
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:41,169
Doesn't seem to work much
as a pickup line, though.

78
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:46,972
Got bad news for you, buddy.
She'll never date you, let alone fuck you.

79
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:50,739
It's just gonna be you and your hand
in your  sleeping bag tonight, buddy.

80
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:56,945
I molested myself last night. I said 'no',
but I knew I really wanted it.

81
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,233
Come here!

82
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:01,843
Ahem!

83
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:05,128
Look, there's three kinds of guys.

84
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:08,316
There's guys you date,
guys you do, and then...

85
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,046
there's guys you wouldn't even touch.

86
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:14,722
Lake, I wouldn't touch him
with somebody else's body

87
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,693
Right... which is why you invited him.

88
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,614
Ah, Kerry!

89
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,599
Come on. For a stalker,
you could do worse.

90
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,195
Oh, sweety, no way.

91
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,897
Have you talked to that guy
since high school?   Ew!

92
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:29,704
What? I'm just saying he's...

93
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:33,551
...kind of funny and not
completely unfortunate looking.

94
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:35,210
He's all yours, Jenn.

95
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:38,546
'He's all yours, Jenn.'

96
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,284
Hurry up, kids.
Got to make it before sunset.

97
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,770
Hey guys.
Where's Chad and Lauren?

98
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,700
I don't see any other cars.
Are you sure this is the right place?

99
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:10,805
Somewhere around here.

100
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:14,314
Well, can you call Veronica or someone
and ask them where they are?

101
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,349
If that's what you want.

102
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:18,934
I thought the whole point
of us coming out here

103
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,259
was for me to
get to know your friends.

104
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:25,414
Listen, Chad.

105
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,620
we have days to
get to know my friends

106
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:32,149
so you can either
play with them tonight,

107
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:35,451
or you can
play with me.

108
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:38,475
I guess we can
see them tomorrow.

109
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,015
Oh yes.

110
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:06,097
Oh. Oh no.
- No! - No! - No!

111
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:10,357
Hey.

112
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,176
Where'd Thomas go?

113
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,464
Guys?

114
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,462
Guys!

115
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,085
Hello?

116
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:59,198
Ohh. What's that smell?

117
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:02,357
Yeah, Lake, what
crawled up your ass and died?

118
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,468
Have you been drinking
that skunked beer again?

119
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:06,892
As a matter of fact,

120
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,720
yeah, I had like two.

121
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:12,120
Hey but that smell's not me.

122
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:15,089
I would claim something that impressive.
For real.

123
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:21,517
What the hell
happened to our tent?

124
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:23,679
Where's Tom?

125
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:25,443
A bear ate him.

126
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:27,120
Yeah. Too bad it wasn't you.

127
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,896
Tom!
- Tom!

128
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:31,462
Hey, Tom! Where are you!

129
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:33,132
Thomas!
- Tom?

130
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:35,225
Tom! Where are you?!
- Tommy!

131
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,929
Dude, what the hell
happened to our tent?

132
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,828
What the fuck?

133
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:48,569
What?

134
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,391
What the hell is going on?

135
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,366
Tom?

136
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,721
- Anybody else parched, man?
- Lake, shut up.

137
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:56,522
- I'm thirsty!
- Shhh!

138
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,150
What are you doing?

139
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,459
Seriously, Tom,
what the fuck?!?

140
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:05,665
Okay.   I'm not crazy, right?

141
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,104
I mean everybody else saw
that that tent was fucked up?

142
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:09,152
Yes.

143
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:11,450
Alright, Tom.
This isn't funny anymore.

144
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,454
Funny?   This isn't a prank.

145
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:16,459
We're all just
loosing our minds!

146
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:18,807
Lake, do you always
have to be so contemptuous?

147
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:20,010
Contemptuous?

148
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,407
Just like old times.

149
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:24,208
- That's not even a word!
- Are you really that stupid?

150
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:25,963
Don't call me stupid, alright!

151
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:27,716
Will the two of you
just knock it off!

152
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:30,569
You know Tom,
sometimes I wonder why I'm--

153
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:33,423
Holy shit, the tent!

154
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,885
Oh my God!

155
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:41,805
No way!

156
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:44,559
Come on.
Everybody run. Run!

157
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,895
Run!

158
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,315
Wait!

159
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,539
Wait!

160
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:49,245
No! No-o!

161
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:56,192
I'm telling you
it's a God-damn Banshee!

162
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:57,839
I'm telling you you're crazy!

163
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:59,282
I'm not crazy!

164
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:02,593
I've been hearing the... the screams
and the wails in the woods.

165
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:04,550
This isn't Ireland, man!

166
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,219
The two of you guys need
to calm down

167
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,678
before you both end up
in the drunk tank for the night

168
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:11,085
What on Earth are you old coots
yapping about now?

169
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:12,704
Ah. It's no use, Jules.

170
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,933
This old man has got it in his head

171
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:17,080
that there's a
fucking Banshee in the woods!

172
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,020
It's true! I've heard it.

173
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,754
Someone's gonna die.

174
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,464
You've been hearing it.
Everybody knows you've been hearing it.

175
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:29,327
August 6th, 1970!
It killed my brother!

176
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:30,660
Oh, for Christ sakes!

177
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:31,770
Alan,

178
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:36,292
there is no Banshee up in the woods.
Your brother ran away.

179
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:51,661
Hello! Hello is there anybody in there?!

180
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:55,099
You actually thought
there was somebody living in there?

181
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,433
It was worth a shot.

182
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,102
Come on, lets go.

183
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:05,380
Wait, wait!
Wait.

184
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:06,752
What?

185
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:11,195
I'm sorry guys, but I got to piss.

186
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:15,175
Are you serious?

187
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,791
That's something you'd expect from Lake
at a time like this, not from you.

188
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:20,730
She's right, man.

189
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,015
- Hold it!
- I have been!

190
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:24,341
Go in your pants.

191
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,048
Yeah, man,
just piss yourself.

192
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,201
Fuck you guys!

193
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:31,926
Well hurry up!

194
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:41,910
Anything?

195
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:45,163
Figures.

196
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:54,969
Damn it.

197
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,425
He's probably taking a shit, too.

198
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:59,173
Ah-hh!

199
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:17,524
Oh Shit!

200
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:14,644
<i>Hey, Hoolahan the weatherman here.</i>

201
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,666
<i>If you're planning any
outdoor activities for tomorrow,</i>

202
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:19,896
<i> you may want to
think about cancelling them,</i>

203
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:23,609
<i>because the storm front that
we predicted would be moving south...</i>

204
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,293
<i>well it changed course and
is moving straight</i>

205
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,426
<i>towards the eastern
part of the state.</i>

206
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:31,717
<i>So, if you live
in any of the eastern counties,</i>

207
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:33,789
<i>stay indoors.</i>

208
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,777
<i>The thunderstorm will also bring
high winds and--</i>

209
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:39,197
I don't know how you
calmed those two down tonight.

210
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:44,117
Yeah, seriously,
I been trying for... 20 minutes.

211
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:48,274
Well, when they act like children
you just got to treat 'em like children.

212
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:50,846
Got to remember that.

213
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:53,050
Long day, huh?

214
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:55,443
Eh...
just boring.

215
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,893
What do you think got ole' Alan
going on tonight about that Banshee?

216
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,160
Your guess is as good as mine.

217
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:09,221
I don't even know
what he was talking about.

218
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:11,249
Some old Irish legend.

219
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:14,606
Supposed to hear it scream
before you die or something.

220
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,908
My grandfather used to
tell me about it when I was little.

221
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,396
Crazy old man.

222
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,115
Well, it's about time
we moved out, Jul.

223
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:27,109
- Alright, see you back at the station.
- Yup. See you later, guys.

224
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:30,691
Another one?

225
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:32,672
Actually...

226
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:36,029
give me a shot
of your finest whiskey.

227
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:45,586
To Banshees!

228
00:21:57,905 --> 00:21:59,596
Mm, that thing almost ate you.

229
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:00,935
Shut up.

230
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:03,736
Hey Corey,

231
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:06,050
so what's it like to be
a part of the food chain?

232
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:09,130
What's it like to be a coward
that runs away like a little girl?

233
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:11,020
Relax!   Calm down,

234
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,261
I'm just tryin'
to keep y'all in good spirits.

235
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:15,345
Lake, shut it!
- Yeah.

236
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:17,800
Don't you think
we're already scared enough?

237
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:20,238
What's that?

238
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,410
Come on.

239
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,714
I'm not trying
to die out here either.

240
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:50,961
Hey, I'm serious.

241
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:54,895
I want to grow old
and die peaceful in my sleep.

242
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,169
Like my granddad.

243
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:04,227
Not kicking and screaming like
the passengers in the back seat of his car!

244
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,316
What?
That was funny.

245
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:12,431
No no. That was not funny.

246
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:14,275
That shit was funny.

247
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:22,950
Not that I don't want you here
or anything, but...

248
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,960
don't you have
a job you should be doing?

249
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,586
Nobody moves!

250
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:46,109
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

251
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:48,104
We need help, man!
Our friends just got--

252
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:50,925
Hey!   Shut up.

253
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:53,745
I got you uncle Jack.

254
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,838
Alright, they're okay.

255
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,008
Alright, come on in here.
Let's go.

256
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,835
At least he'll have a phone.

257
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:19,622
Hey Corey, come on!

258
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:23,751
With pleasure.

259
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,404
Everybody in!   Hurry up!
Everybody in!

260
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:31,440
Hurry up!   Hurry up!
Come on,  get in!

261
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:35,872
Get in here, hurry up!   Help me get
this stuff in front of the door, come on!

262
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:44,477
Corey...

263
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,932
What--the fuck--is that?

264
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:56,028
What's up with Jack and his wife
out at the farm?

265
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,197
I haven't seen him
around town this week.

266
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,657
Ah, it's a trek for them.

267
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:01,926
That place is
keeping him busy up there.

268
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:05,468
They're just trying to stay afloat
like everyone else I guess.

269
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:06,695
I hear that.

270
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:10,313
I don't know, lady.
We've been fighting it for days!

271
00:25:16,454 --> 00:25:19,452
Do you know
he's blasting dynamite every day.

272
00:25:20,492 --> 00:25:22,100
Hard worker.

273
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:31,322
I know how you guys have
been struggling with those... cutbacks.

274
00:25:31,377 --> 00:25:34,402
Please!  I don't even
have a real patrol car.

275
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:37,289
Next thing you know
they'll be taking my gun away.

276
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:41,004
- Ah...
- Thanks Pete.   -Good night.

277
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:54,333
You're wasting your time.

278
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,109
 I've tried all over the
house.

279
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,099
Line's down.

280
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:08,067
I have no idea how
we even still have power.

281
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:17,836
Do you have one of those um...
radios, you know, that the truckers use?

282
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:19,596
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
we got one of those.  - Okay.

283
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,777
- Oh it's broken, though. We found
it in the basement earlier today.

284
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:25,640
Me and my uncle
tried to get it working, but ah...

285
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:28,680
...until then, we are just
entirely cut off.

286
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:41,508
So...

287
00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:45,877
what is that thing out there?

288
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:50,525
It's a mutated man-child.

289
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:57,333
A top secret government project
gone horribly wrong.

290
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,530
No way... Really?

291
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:05,270
No!
The fuck if I know what that is.

292
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:19,282
That thing sucked Corey dry!

293
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:21,888
Lake.

294
00:27:23,815 --> 00:27:25,113
Please.

295
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,697
Please!

296
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:43,518
<i>422 come in.</i>

297
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:48,276
<i>422 come in.</i>

298
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:53,450
<i>422 come in?</i>

299
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:56,965
<i>- 422 come in.</i>
- 422 here.

300
00:27:57,082 --> 00:27:59,613
<i>422 come in...
Bansley, do you copy?</i>

301
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:02,299
Piece of shit!
 422 here!

302
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,558
<i>Jul, we got another thirty-eight
at the Parker residence.</i>

303
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:10,103
Copy that.

304
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,637
Probably that daughter of hers again.
I'm on my way.

305
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:15,813
<i>Good luck!</i>

306
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,191
So this might be a really dumb question,
but... what are you doing?

307
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:42,464
Mrs. Parker please calm down.

308
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:46,221
Don't you tell me to calm down.
I'm telling you something's wrong.

309
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:50,386
My daughter's never like this,
she's very responsible.

310
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:53,602
<i>Bye Ma!
I'm going to the mall!</i>

311
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,490
<i>Oh. Fuck!</i>

312
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:02,820
Mrs. Parker, every time you phone us,
it's about your daughter.

313
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,336
What are you insinuating?

314
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:09,410
Nothing.   I'm sure she's just
out with her friends.

315
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:12,846
Well I'm sure she's being pursued
by some sexual deviant

316
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,582
on a dangerous camping trip

317
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,623
her father told her
she could go on!

318
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,768
Look,
I worry about her.

319
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:32,855
Does she have a cell phone?

320
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:36,987
Of course she has a cell phone.
Do I look stupid to you?

321
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,557
There's no service
that deep in the woods.

322
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:43,665
Could you just do your job
and find my daughter?

323
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,445
They don't pay me enough
for this shit!

324
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:21,290
For your ears.

325
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,115
- Hey Rocker.
- Yeah?

326
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,208
Who's blood is that in there?

327
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,887
My Aunt Rose's.

328
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:51,989
I'm really sorry.

329
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,719
Do you mind if I ask
how it happened?

330
00:30:57,824 --> 00:31:00,300
She didn't have these
in her ears.

331
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:01,853
Are you trying
to be an asshole

332
00:31:01,878 --> 00:31:03,779
or does it really
come that naturally, Lake?

333
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,935
I'm just saying, right?
Right.

334
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:12,680
I'm sorry.

335
00:31:16,046 --> 00:31:17,434
What happened?

336
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:23,512
Max!

337
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:36,699
Max!

338
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:40,075
Max! Max come on boy!

339
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,199
Max!  Max!
Here boy!

340
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,418
Max!

341
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,158
Oh no.   Aw Max!

342
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:02,438
Max...

343
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:13,768
Rose!

344
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:15,709
Fuck it.

345
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:26,927
Get off her you son of a bitch!

346
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,373
Die!

347
00:33:34,098 --> 00:33:35,383
Ahh!

348
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:17,154
Jennifer?

349
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,820
422 to dispatch.  Come in.

350
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,897
Uhhh!   422.  Over.

351
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,046
<i>Dispatch.  What's the trouble, Jul?</i>

352
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:44,601
I'm up at Old Mill Road
on a lead about that Parker girl.

353
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:47,469
I'm gonna go up to the tracks
and see if I can find her campsite.

354
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,325
Shut her damn mother up
for a change.

355
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:51,725
<i>If you need anything,
let me know.</i>

356
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:53,985
I'll check in in twenty.
- <i>Take care.</i>

357
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:56,778
If this damn radio works.

358
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:03,568
Great!
Great.

359
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:08,235
Yeah it's hot as hell
here too.

360
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,741
I haven't heard
from him today either.

361
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,245
Well, maybe the lightning
knocked out his line.

362
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:22,647
Alright.

363
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:25,890
No, that's a good idea.

364
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:27,763
Okay.

365
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:33,446
Alright, Earl.
Give me a call when you get back.

366
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,366
Okay. Goodbye.

367
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,127
I can't believe that
this is all really happening.

368
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:55,106
So then,
what's your story?

369
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:57,027
Story?

370
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,112
Yeah, how did you
end up here?

371
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:04,412
I was just up here for a nice weekend
with my aunt and uncle.

372
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:14,498
Aunt Rose!

373
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:21,789
Aunt Rose?

374
00:38:24,117 --> 00:38:25,724
What the fuck?!

375
00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:34,722
Uncle Jack! Uncle jack.

376
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:51,555
Uncle Jack.

377
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:55,208
Rose?!
It's Rose!

378
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:56,664
That's not her!

379
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:02,780
No!

380
00:39:05,782 --> 00:39:07,178
Explains the dead phone.

381
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,432
Yeah.  I wasn't exactly
aiming for the pole, dick.

382
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:27,409
Oh shit!

383
00:39:45,892 --> 00:39:47,390
Where's Rose?

384
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:50,425
I told you.
It wasn't her.

385
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:52,458
I thought...

386
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:53,828
Yeah.

387
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:56,389
Fucking airbags, huh?

388
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,592
Wow.

389
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:33,651
Come on, Rocker, grab that thing
and put it in front of the door.   Come on.

390
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,313
It took her.

391
00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:52,030
That poor man.

392
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:57,331
It's the first time
I've ever seen him cry.

393
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:00,200
Infrasound.

394
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,539
What?

395
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,129
Infrasound.

396
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:08,647
It's a sound too low for
humans to hear.

397
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:12,004
They use the same frequency
with seismographs.

398
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:13,929
How do you know that?

399
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:17,107
Honey, I'm a zoology major.

400
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,768
We've been friends for
four years you don't know that?

401
00:41:24,455 --> 00:41:27,774
Some animals use it
to communicate over long distances.

402
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:32,324
You see things that aren't there

403
00:41:32,394 --> 00:41:34,830
when the frequency
gets too close to your eyes.

404
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:38,752
When did you become smart?

405
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:40,544
Lake,

406
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,715
not everybody goes to college so they can
drink beer and pee on things.

407
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:49,728
Hey man, you got any beer or moonshine or
anything in this place?

408
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:55,207
Okay.
I'll just check for myself.

409
00:42:00,612 --> 00:42:01,841
You guys hungry?

410
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:03,696
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah. I'm starving.

411
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:52,427
Hey what are you doing here.

412
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:55,837
What are you lost sweetie?

413
00:42:58,145 --> 00:42:59,621
What are you doing?

414
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,907
Holy shit!

415
00:43:38,245 --> 00:43:40,289
422 to dispatch.  Come in.

416
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:43,989
422 dispatch, come in!

417
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,338
Jack, I hope you're home.

418
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,986
So...Rocker.

419
00:44:13,322 --> 00:44:15,046
That's not your real name,
is it?

420
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,605
And what makes you say that?

421
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:19,049
Come on.
That's nobody's name.

422
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,808
Well it's my nickname.

423
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:23,439
I got it as a kid.
It just kinda stuck.

424
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,191
Hmm.  So then,
what's your real name?

425
00:44:26,295 --> 00:44:27,646
Don't worry about it.

426
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:32,539
Come on.
I promise I won't tell anybody.

427
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,521
And Neither will I.

428
00:44:36,893 --> 00:44:40,589
So what are you?
Some kind of rock star or something?

429
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,477
Yeah.  Well, Freelance.

430
00:44:42,884 --> 00:44:44,181
Freelance?
- Yeah.

431
00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:47,086
 I got a band together
and we've played a couple of shows.

432
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,610
Nothing too big
or that even pays well.

433
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,369
What's your band called?

434
00:44:51,783 --> 00:44:53,584
'City Monster Death Squad.'

435
00:44:54,414 --> 00:44:56,610
Original.
Are you guys any good?

436
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:58,663
You don't even know.

437
00:45:00,424 --> 00:45:03,953
So then, why are you
still playing open mic night?

438
00:45:04,058 --> 00:45:05,281
Ooh.

439
00:45:06,468 --> 00:45:09,317
You know...
you're making this hard

440
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:11,549
for me
to impress you.

441
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,220
News flash flash, rock star,

442
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,810
you and your uncle are the
only reason I'm alive right now,

443
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:20,678
that any of us are alive.

444
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,753
You really don't
have to try much harder.

445
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,326
Are you and Lake seeing each other?

446
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:31,853
Lake might think so.
Uh...

447
00:45:32,618 --> 00:45:35,356
 It's kind of a long story.
I mean for the last few years,

448
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:36,757
he's just been--

449
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:39,467
Yeah, that's, it's,
I was just joking.

450
00:45:39,564 --> 00:45:40,564
Oh.

451
00:45:41,494 --> 00:45:43,881
I guess it is pretty funny,
I mean--

452
00:45:43,926 --> 00:45:45,342
Yeah I thought so.

453
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,308
Alright, well enough about me.
Let's hear some about you.

454
00:45:49,938 --> 00:45:50,944
Umm...

455
00:45:51,554 --> 00:45:53,361
There's really
not much to tell.

456
00:45:53,864 --> 00:45:54,864
Uh, I mean...

457
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,580
I'm senior at
a shitty state college.

458
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:03,038
I um, decided to spend the spring break
with my friends from home.

459
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:06,037
And it seems like we're all just

460
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:09,879
trying to ignore the
fact that every time we get together

461
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:13,461
we grow further and further apart.

462
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:17,522
So do you have a boyfriend?

463
00:46:18,397 --> 00:46:26,379
Beside my imaginary lover
and stalker since I was twelve?  Lake?  No.

464
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:30,991
Wow.  That's beautiful.
That is beautiful right there.

465
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:32,720
What do you want Lake?

466
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:35,431
Nothing really I am curious though,

467
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,221
why the hell have we
been listening to Rocker

468
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,084
and the old wise man
over there?

469
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:42,842
Why don't you cut us
some fucking slack... Lake.

470
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:45,991
Cause I'm not taking orders
from you anymore.

471
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:50,394
And... and... keep your
fucking cotton balls... what--

472
00:46:50,419 --> 00:46:52,788
It's all a bunch of bullshit.
I say we just get the hell out of here.

473
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:54,784
You have no idea
what you're talking about!

474
00:46:54,809 --> 00:46:58,402
Just knock it off, Veronica.
I'm so sick of this mess.

475
00:46:58,465 --> 00:46:59,654
You're sick of this mess.

476
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:02,555
Yes.
I've done everything for you!

477
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:06,719
I've followed you around
like a fucking lap dog since middle school!

478
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,338
And what has it gotten me?
- Hm.

479
00:47:09,776 --> 00:47:14,819
A broken heart, a migraine,
and a pair of blue bails

480
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:19,826
I cannot fucking believe
you're gonna pull this shit right now!

481
00:47:20,222 --> 00:47:22,472
After everything we have
been through today.

482
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:25,039
Do you not remember
what happened to Tom...

483
00:47:25,687 --> 00:47:26,715
to Mike...

484
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,335
to Jenn...
and to Corey!

485
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,780
- So we're just gonna wait here...
- Yes.

486
00:47:30,864 --> 00:47:33,492
and waste time before it eventually
comes  and kills us too?

487
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:35,163
That's the fucking plan?

488
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:38,253
Fuck that!

489
00:47:39,005 --> 00:47:41,385
I've had enough
of this horror show.

490
00:47:41,814 --> 00:47:43,473
I'm fucking out
of here.

491
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,715
Lake, stop!

492
00:47:46,134 --> 00:47:47,871
Nobody's going anywhere!

493
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:51,687
Listen folks.  I know we all
need to get a rest,

494
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:53,930
so why don't we go up in the living room
and take it easy

495
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,434
and hopefully by morning
I'll have that radio fixed

496
00:47:56,552 --> 00:47:58,555
so we can all
get the hell out of here.

497
00:47:58,688 --> 00:48:01,473
Does that sound good?
Perfect.   Come on.

498
00:48:09,003 --> 00:48:14,459
Listen up River, Puddle, Lake, whatever
it is the hell that your friends call you.

499
00:48:14,928 --> 00:48:17,970
If you do anything
to put us in harm's way,

500
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,110
I'm going
to truss you up like a turkey

501
00:48:20,301 --> 00:48:24,730
and throw you out the front door
so that monster can eat you all by himself.

502
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:27,834
Are we on the same page on this?

503
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:30,041
Okay.

504
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:32,314
Now, why don't we go upstairs and
you make nicey-nice

505
00:48:32,354 --> 00:48:33,383
with all the other folks

506
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:36,827
and maybe we'll get
to the prom this year, huh?  Good.

507
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:15,568
Who's out there?

508
00:49:18,575 --> 00:49:20,067
Show yourself!

509
00:50:04,865 --> 00:50:08,315
For once, Mrs. Parker,
you might be right.

510
00:52:24,578 --> 00:52:26,661
- What?
- That was fast

511
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:29,986
- Huh?
- I said: 'that was fast.'

512
00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:31,664
What was?

513
00:52:31,825 --> 00:52:34,050
What was?  Exactly...

514
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,174
...expect nothing less from a
guy named Lake.

515
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:10,428
Damn.  I always knew
you was a freak.

516
00:53:11,761 --> 00:53:13,141
What are you talking about?

517
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:16,291
You and Lake
just went upstairs, right?

518
00:53:16,372 --> 00:53:17,396
What?

519
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:19,374
Hey! What are you doin'?!
Ahhh!

520
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:24,773
- Uncle Jack! It's in the house!
- Kerry!

521
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:01,918
How the hell did this thing get in
without us even hearing it?

522
00:54:02,308 --> 00:54:04,926
Ah. It had cover noise
from the thunderstorm last night.

523
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:06,493
And the earplugs.

524
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:10,427
Alright, Uncle Jack, get some wood.
I'm gonna get some nails...

525
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,336
What's the point?

526
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:15,009
What do you mean
what's-what's the point?

527
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,335
You think a couple of more nails
is gonna keep that out of here?

528
00:54:18,515 --> 00:54:20,140
It's just keeping us around.

529
00:54:20,296 --> 00:54:22,764
Yeah, if it wanted to kill us,
it would have done it already.

530
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:25,810
It'll be back at chowtime.

531
00:54:26,278 --> 00:54:28,574
So what are we gonna do
are we just gonna give up?

532
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:32,601
Hell no we're not gonna give up!
We're gonna get serious.

533
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:34,234
We're gonna stay together

534
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:37,447
and we're gonna use our earplugs.
And that's key.

535
00:54:38,268 --> 00:54:43,015
And just maybe...
some of us will get very very lucky...

536
00:54:43,504 --> 00:54:45,987
and live to see
the sunrise tomorrow.

537
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:09,455
Lauren, wait.
Maybe we should go back into town..

538
00:55:09,924 --> 00:55:11,404
or try to find everyone else.

539
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,757
You're not scared are you?

540
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,049
- It's just that we're out here all alone--
- Shhhh.

541
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:32,616
I think there's someone out there.

542
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:36,435
You know, this will be
a lot easier if you don't think.

543
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:53,412
Oh... well that feels...
really... nice.

544
00:57:06,412 --> 00:57:07,538
Where you going?

545
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,282
Bathroom.

546
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,435
But I didn't even finish!

547
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:16,418
I did.
Hold tight.

548
00:57:19,386 --> 00:57:21,483
Aw, Come on!

549
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,265
Hey Chad!

550
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:31,752
Chad?

551
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:48,105
Oh Chad, thank God!

552
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:31,553
Someone's Gonna die!
Unhand me!

553
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:34,694
It's true! The Lord says unto
the mountains from the heavens,

554
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:36,939
it's the end of the world!

555
00:59:38,693 --> 00:59:40,457
What is it this time?

556
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:44,463
Public intoxication, verbal disturbance
- Eh.

557
00:59:44,698 --> 00:59:49,673
and... indecent exposure.
- Indecent exposure?    Oh!

558
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:53,749
Oh Alan. Feeling adventurous tonight, huh?

559
00:59:56,658 --> 01:00:01,427
They neither sow nor reap,
yet the Heavenly Father feeds them.

560
01:00:01,457 --> 01:00:03,279
I'll have to remember that.

561
01:00:03,388 --> 01:00:06,521
Listen Harry,
you can't keep him here tonight.

562
01:00:07,214 --> 01:00:08,585
Why not?

563
01:00:08,701 --> 01:00:14,023
Because... the sprinkler system
malfunctioned and flooded the cells.

564
01:00:14,131 --> 01:00:16,470
Well what the hell do you suggest
we're gonna do with him?

565
01:00:16,682 --> 01:00:20,127
Transfer him to Clinton Station.
- Ahh...

566
01:00:21,054 --> 01:00:22,054
Sorry.

567
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:24,029
Come on, Harry.

568
01:00:25,116 --> 01:00:26,741
Alan's starting to creep me out.

569
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:30,200
Oh and one more thing.

570
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:31,916
Yes.

571
01:00:32,201 --> 01:00:35,396
Jul isn't back yet,
and I can't get her on the radio.

572
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,842
When was the last time
you heard from her?

573
01:00:37,912 --> 01:00:42,059
She went to investigate some kids
camping off of Old Mill Road.

574
01:00:42,648 --> 01:00:46,482
- Do you guys have, like groupies?
- Why, you want to be one?

575
01:00:46,632 --> 01:00:48,431
I don't know... maybe.

576
01:00:49,456 --> 01:00:52,289
We always have an extra room
on the groupie bus.

577
01:00:52,727 --> 01:00:53,785
So what are you saying?

578
01:00:55,254 --> 01:00:57,357
Jack! Jack!   It's me Julie,
if you're there, you've got to let me in!

579
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:59,373
- Jul? Is that you?
- Yeah!

580
01:00:59,662 --> 01:01:01,648
- Back up!
- What?

581
01:01:01,816 --> 01:01:04,342
- Step back!
- Why?

582
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:08,613
If you want to come in,
you're gonna do as I say right now!

583
01:01:08,638 --> 01:01:09,984
Jack, ifs me.

584
01:01:10,017 --> 01:01:13,920
What are you... what are you doing?
She looks fine.   Get in.

585
01:01:17,865 --> 01:01:20,632
- Your radio working?
- No. I need to use your phone.

586
01:01:20,671 --> 01:01:21,923
It's dead.

587
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:25,677
You are not going to believe
the shit I've seen tonight.

588
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,346
Okay, Crazy Ralph,
keep your clothes on,

589
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:45,377
and your mouth shut.

590
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:58,192
Jul! Julianna! You out there?

591
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:08,791
Earl, what are you doing out here?

592
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:12,081
I'm on my way to Jack's house.
His telephone lines must be down.

593
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:14,862
You didn't happen to see Julianna
on the way up,  did you?

594
01:02:16,276 --> 01:02:17,607
Think you can fix it?

595
01:02:17,896 --> 01:02:21,330
Well the thing breaks all the time.
Usually I can get it up and running again.

596
01:02:21,464 --> 01:02:24,543
Hm. Hope you have better luck with that
than I had with this piece of shit.

597
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,296
Well I didn't have my tools there, though.

598
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:28,142
- Thank you.
- Not a problem.

599
01:02:29,085 --> 01:02:31,401
Well, let's give it a try.

600
01:02:34,499 --> 01:02:36,241
That's it!
You got it!

601
01:02:36,337 --> 01:02:38,384
Ahh...  hopefully
someone's listening out there.

602
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:42,525
   - 42-2
- <i>-ple- -ency</i>

603
01:02:43,996 --> 01:02:44,997
422.

604
01:02:45,024 --> 01:02:46,300
I haven't seen anybody!

605
01:02:46,325 --> 01:02:47,478
<i>Come in. This is an emergency!</i>

606
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:51,835
Badge 422. This is badge 90. What's your
emergency?

607
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:55,385
Oh, Harry, yes.   Thank God!
We're up at Jack Gorman's place.

608
01:02:55,415 --> 01:02:58,025
<i> ...end help...   elp...</i>

609
01:02:59,915 --> 01:03:02,478
- Oh shit!
- Think he heard you?

610
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:05,092
Who knows?
We have to assume not.

611
01:03:06,071 --> 01:03:09,017
- We need to come up with a plan.
- Fucking A.

612
01:03:18,258 --> 01:03:21,421
I told you!
I told you those cries were for real!

613
01:03:22,995 --> 01:03:24,889
Mh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

614
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:28,300
We need to come up
with a strategy

615
01:03:28,315 --> 01:03:29,756
to get the hell out of here
is what we need.

616
01:03:29,781 --> 01:03:31,261
Well, I made it here by foot.

617
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,456
We could go out to the road
and flag someone down.

618
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:35,167
- No no no!
- I don't recommend that.

619
01:03:36,827 --> 01:03:38,989
Jack, where's your truck?
- It's in the barn.

620
01:03:39,461 --> 01:03:43,231
- So we distract it and make a run for it.
- Ok. Yeah.

621
01:03:43,256 --> 01:03:45,109
I don't know.  It's been giving me
a lot of trouble lately

622
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:46,630
I don't even know if
it's gonna start!

623
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:48,756
- But it's worth a try, right?
- Yeah!

624
01:03:49,022 --> 01:03:51,758
Ahhh...  I suppose if we have
no other choice--

625
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:55,349
Oh. I've got an idea.

626
01:03:56,054 --> 01:03:57,156
Alright.

627
01:05:27,198 --> 01:05:28,198
Huhh!

628
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:31,209
- Oh shit!  Just what we needed.
- Perfect.

629
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:32,483
Huuh.

630
01:05:35,502 --> 01:05:37,961
Listen. I'm gonna run out
and kickstart that generator.

631
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,501
Get the power back here.

632
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:43,683
Uncle Jack, no.

633
01:05:44,495 --> 01:05:46,690
Listen, you're a
better shot than I am.

634
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:50,064
You're gonna cover me.
I'm making the run.

635
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:52,172
Hhhhh.

636
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:53,976
Alright. Sounds good.

637
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,544
Hurry up!

638
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:46,863
Hhhh!
Come on Rocker!

639
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:21,640
Hhh!  Uncle Jack!
You scared the fuck out of me!

640
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:01,287
Oh my God.

641
01:08:04,585 --> 01:08:05,587
Jul?

642
01:08:12,228 --> 01:08:13,530
- You alright?
- What happened?

643
01:08:13,643 --> 01:08:14,643
Huhh.

644
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:16,791
Where's Jack?

645
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:22,368
Jul, what's going on?

646
01:08:24,907 --> 01:08:25,907
Jul?

647
01:08:27,363 --> 01:08:28,496
- Hhh!
- Is he--

648
01:08:28,635 --> 01:08:29,836
They're here.

649
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:32,873
Jul?

650
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:35,681
What the hell?

651
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:38,843
Turn the sirens back on!

652
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:44,087
The sirens!
Turn the sirens back on!

653
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,727
Oh my Christ!

654
01:08:50,942 --> 01:08:52,577
Uh, Harry?

655
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,429
What do you suggest we do?
Arrest it?

656
01:08:54,471 --> 01:08:56,462
I suggest we just start shooting!

657
01:09:00,313 --> 01:09:02,500
What in the hell was that?

658
01:09:03,344 --> 01:09:04,544
It's a Banshee!

659
01:09:04,634 --> 01:09:05,687
<i>I told you so! I told you so!</i>
- Guys,

660
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,405
quick! In the house!
- <i>I told you so!</i>

661
01:09:07,451 --> 01:09:08,451
It's really me!

662
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:14,354
I knew you were real.
After all these years...  I'm not crazy!

663
01:09:14,469 --> 01:09:17,467
Alan, get your ass in the house!

664
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:25,933
I knew you were real!
Ha ha ha!   I'm not crazy!

665
01:09:25,986 --> 01:09:27,949
Alan, will you get back
in the God--

666
01:09:54,504 --> 01:09:56,846
You hold it right there
you son of a bitch!

667
01:10:07,657 --> 01:10:08,996
Damn it!

668
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:28,806
Oooo.  Ooo.

669
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,253
- Ok. I'm...
- Oh God!   Get it out!

670
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:34,857
Just take it out!

671
01:10:35,045 --> 01:10:36,112
- Please do it.
Uhh!

672
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:38,848
- No I'm--  Oh shit!
Okay.

673
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:41,309
- Hurry up!  Come on!
- No no no no!   Okay okay!

674
01:10:41,828 --> 01:10:44,804
Okay... okay, I'm gonna...
- Ow!

675
01:10:45,181 --> 01:10:46,381
I'll just... um...

676
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:47,955
Ow!  Ahh!

677
01:10:48,217 --> 01:10:50,548
Hold still okay?
-  Oh shit!  Mmm!

678
01:10:52,186 --> 01:10:54,718
Oh my God!
I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!

679
01:10:54,789 --> 01:10:57,349
- I just can't do this!
- Just take the fucking thing out already!

680
01:10:57,424 --> 01:10:59,290
No!  No really.
I just can't do that!  I'm sorry!

681
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:01,324
Maybe you could just leave it
in there for a couple of minutes...

682
01:11:01,379 --> 01:11:02,739
I'll go get Jack.
It'll be ok.

683
01:11:02,763 --> 01:11:04,622
Screw it! Screw it! Just screw it.

684
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,818
- You're seriously gonna--   - Ahh!
- Oh my God!

685
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:18,207
Oww!

686
01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:23,468
Oh my God.
Oh my God.  Oh my...

687
01:11:30,712 --> 01:11:33,242
Okay.  Okay.

688
01:11:37,245 --> 01:11:41,309
Okay, this is gonna hurt.  A lot.
Oh my God...

689
01:11:43,895 --> 01:11:45,196
Okay...

690
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,369
That's so gross.

691
01:11:58,123 --> 01:11:59,787
Julianna...   are you...

692
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:03,557
Julianna?

693
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:26,815
For when you wake up.

694
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:37,171
So, how is she?

695
01:12:37,548 --> 01:12:38,742
She's not good.

696
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:40,412
She passed out.

697
01:12:41,443 --> 01:12:43,541
Look, we have to
get to that truck now.

698
01:12:44,524 --> 01:12:45,959
Connelly's car.

699
01:12:46,122 --> 01:12:47,214
What about it?

700
01:12:47,392 --> 01:12:50,348
Well, we don't have to go to the barn,
 Connelly's car is right out front.

701
01:12:50,685 --> 01:12:53,639
- Where are the keys?
- In his pocket I guess.

702
01:12:55,441 --> 01:12:58,646
Alright. I'll make a run for it.
I'll bring the car right to the door.

703
01:13:00,847 --> 01:13:05,097
- Oh my God, what was that?
- Holy shit!

704
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,576
We got to get out of here now!
Come on!

705
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:09,385
Give me the keys, Jack.
- No.

706
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:11,429
No.   Ronnie I'm going.

707
01:13:11,507 --> 01:13:13,832
You got this whole badass,
independent woman thing going on

708
01:13:13,837 --> 01:13:16,515
and trust me,
it really does work for you.

709
01:13:16,879 --> 01:13:19,463
But I'm not going
to stand here and do nothing.

710
01:13:19,674 --> 01:13:22,356
I'm not going to sit
and watch my friends die.

711
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:26,789
I'm going...
I'm going.

712
01:13:30,813 --> 01:13:32,660
Alright.
This is it.

713
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,675
Let's rock.

714
01:14:02,003 --> 01:14:03,879
Rocker. Hit it!

715
01:14:07,029 --> 01:14:08,397
Kerry, now!

716
01:14:29,482 --> 01:14:30,983
Nice truck, Jack.

717
01:15:16,474 --> 01:15:19,409
Come on you piece of shit!
Please start.      Please start!

718
01:15:49,956 --> 01:15:50,962
Kerry...

719
01:15:53,504 --> 01:15:57,270
Oh! Ok. Ok great!

720
01:15:58,697 --> 01:16:02,054
- Fuck!
- No! NOOOO!

721
01:16:31,084 --> 01:16:32,697
They're all dead.

722
01:16:37,033 --> 01:16:38,829
I know how it feels.

723
01:16:42,018 --> 01:16:44,898
We're going to die here tonight.
Aren't we?

724
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,735
Chances are
we'll be dead by dawn.

725
01:16:58,552 --> 01:17:00,186
Is it out there?

726
01:17:02,175 --> 01:17:06,168
It's planning something.
I know it.

727
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:15,112
Listen.  if I don't get a chance
to tell you this later...

728
01:17:16,059 --> 01:17:21,900
I just... I want to say thank you.
For everything.

729
01:17:35,225 --> 01:17:37,337
Alright Uncle Jack,
what are our options?

730
01:17:39,217 --> 01:17:44,033
Simple.
We kill it before it kills us.

731
01:17:46,325 --> 01:17:48,699
Grab the rest of the gasoline
and the dynamite.

732
01:17:49,066 --> 01:17:50,929
We're going out that front door.

733
01:18:18,349 --> 01:18:22,182
Jul?  Jul.
Wake up.  Jul!

734
01:18:25,908 --> 01:18:27,377
You alright?

735
01:18:38,026 --> 01:18:40,714
Come and get it mother f-- Aah!

736
01:18:47,485 --> 01:18:49,352
Fuck!

737
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:32,910
Fucking die!

738
01:19:36,548 --> 01:19:38,113
Get down!

739
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,402
Here. You throw.
I'll shoot.

740
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:23,490
Hey everybody!   We are uh...
heading out to a concert tonight.

741
01:20:23,537 --> 01:20:26,799
Local group called
'City Monster Death Squad'.

742
01:20:26,924 --> 01:20:30,563
Haha.   The guy on the poster
looks like a complete fucking tool.

743
01:20:30,727 --> 01:20:32,075
It's gonna be hilarious.

744
01:20:32,421 --> 01:20:36,259
Do you have to bring that fucking camera
every time we go out?

745
01:20:36,528 --> 01:20:39,275
I mean does anyone
even watch your videos?

746
01:20:39,322 --> 01:20:42,383
Hey.    My videos get almost
as many hits as your mom.

747
01:20:44,018 --> 01:20:47,396
Yo, dude, you think Danielle Incarnato's
going to be there tonight?

748
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:49,346
What a piece of ass!

749
01:20:49,665 --> 01:20:51,054
If a girl like that gives you
the time of day,

750
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:52,365
you'd better
send a thank you card.

751
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:54,758
Oh oh oh.   Just tell her you're
like a fine wine, ok?

752
01:20:54,894 --> 01:20:55,936
Just hear me out.

753
01:20:56,098 --> 01:20:59,031
Full bodied,
but smooth and goes down easy.

754
01:20:59,302 --> 01:21:00,894
- That was awesome!
- Hey hey hey!   Watch the road,

755
01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:02,109
you're going all
outside the lines.

756
01:21:02,156 --> 01:21:03,669
Yeah. I always
sucked at coloring.

757
01:21:04,237 --> 01:21:05,341
What the fuck was that?!

758
01:21:05,447 --> 01:21:07,074
I don't know!
Did you see it on camera?

759
01:21:07,131 --> 01:21:08,213
No.   No it was too fast.

760
01:21:08,246 --> 01:21:11,254
- Oh.. shit.
- Shit.  God damn!

761
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:18,607
Shit!  Shit!

762
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:21,924
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Oh my God.

763
01:21:21,956 --> 01:21:23,761
- We got to get her to a hospital.
- Put the camera away!

764
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:24,716
What the fuck
did you do, man!

765
01:21:24,765 --> 01:21:27,329
Move over.  Let her in.
- It's alright.   It's alright.

766
01:21:29,059 --> 01:21:30,059
Okay.

767
01:21:30,308 --> 01:21:32,698
Hey. Uh...  are you okay?
Are you...  are you alright?

768
01:21:34,584 --> 01:21:36,166
What are you...
what are you looking at?

769
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:41,371
Is there somebody out there?
ls someone following you?

770
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:43,965
It's alright, it's alright.
Um...  What's--whats your name?

771
01:21:45,269 --> 01:21:46,757
Do you live around here?

772
01:21:47,322 --> 01:21:49,654
So what were you
doing out there all by yourself?

773
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:52,771
Hello?
