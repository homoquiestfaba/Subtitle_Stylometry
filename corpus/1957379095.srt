169
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,583
&gt;&gt; HEY. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN YOUR
HEART.

170
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,583
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

171
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,458
&gt;&gt; SWEETHEART, GO UP AND TAKE
CARE OF JACK.

172
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:34,792
MAKE SURE HE GETS HIS PAJAMAS
ON, WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

173
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,041
&gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO BE CAREFUL.

174
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,709
&gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

175
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,500
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

176
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:57,792
&gt;&gt; I WILL.

177
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,125
BUT I WON'T BE HAPPY...

178
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,500
UNTIL I SEE YOU AGAIN.

179
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:06,917
SOMETIMES I JUST GET SO
TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA

180
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,000
HAPPEN TO US.

181
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:13,417
I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULDN'T
CRY.

182
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,208
&gt;&gt; NOT TO WORRY, MY DARLING
WIFE.

183
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,875
I'LL GET THAT JOB, AND WE'LL BE
MOVING TO KANSAS CITY BEFORE YOU

184
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,041
KNOW IT.

185
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:27,000
I'M SORRY TO BE MISSING
CHRISTMAS, BUT...

186
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,709
BUT I'LL MAKE IT UP TO
EVERYBODY.

187
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:37,458
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU JUST GO ON NOW,
'CAUSE I CAN'T STAND THIS.

188
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,041
JUST REMEMBER THAT I LOVE YOU.

189
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,917
&gt;&gt; AND I LOVE YOU, ANNIE FEAGAN.

190
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,959
LOVE THE SMELL OF YA.

191
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,125
&gt;&gt; WHAT CAUSED THE DEPRESSION?

192
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,834
WHO HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT
THAT?

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,875
&gt;&gt; IT'S WHEN THE STOCK MARKET
WENT TOO HIGH AND THEN CRASHED.

194
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,834
&gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THE DUSTBOWL,
TOO--PEOPLE CAN'T FARM, AND THE

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
FARMERS HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY
ANYTHING.

196
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:47,333
AND THERE ISN'T ENOUGH FOOD TO
EAT, TO IT COSTS TOO MUCH.

197
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,792
&gt;&gt; AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE
OUT OF WORK, SO THEY CAN'T BUY

198
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,834
THINGS ANYMORE.

199
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,083
&gt;&gt; MY MOTHER SAYS THAT HOOVER
CAUSED THE DEPRESSION.

200
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,500
&gt;&gt; IT MIGHT BE MORE HELPFUL TO
THINK THAT HE'S DOING EVERYTHING

201
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,041
HE CAN TO END IT.

202
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,625
THERE YOU ARE, ANDREW.

203
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,291
YOUR REPORT WAS FINE AS FAR AS
IT WENT, BERNICE, IT JUST DIDN'T

204
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,667
GO FAR ENOUGH.

205
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,917
YOU RAN OUT OF STEAM BEFORE YOU
GOT TO THE END.

206
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,417
&gt;&gt; WHAT CAN THE PRESIDENT DO,
MISS KNIGHT?

207
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,667
HE'S JUST ONE PERSON.

208
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,166
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES IS THE MOST POWERFUL MAN

209
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,583
IN THE WORLD.

210
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,917
I WOULD THINK HE CAN DO
ANYTHING, IF HE DECIDES HE

211
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,083
WANTS TO.

212
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,834
&gt;&gt; ( bell rings )
&gt; DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER'S IN

213
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,542
KANSAS CITY YET?

214
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,041
&gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS.

215
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,333
HE SHOULD BE BY NOW.

216
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,625
&gt;&gt; MY FATHER SAYS THERE AREN'T
ANY JOBS ANYWHERE.

217
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,625
&gt;&gt; MY FATHER SAYS IT'S A SURE
THING.

218
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,750
&gt;&gt; I WISH WE HAD THAT CHICKEN IN

219
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,333
EVERY POT PRESIDENT HOOVER
PROMISED, THEN HE WOULDN'T

220
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,917
HAVE TO BE AWAY.

221
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:43,166
&gt;&gt; MY DAD SAYS HOOVER DOESN'T
KNOW HIS YOU-KNOW-WHAT FROM HIS

222
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,208
ELBOW.

223
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,291
&gt;&gt; HERBERT HOOVER IS THE
PRESIDENT.

224
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,875
HE CAN DO ANYTHING.

225
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,208
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU COME OVER TO MY HOUSE
LATER?

226
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,542
&gt;&gt; MAYBE I'LL ASK.

227
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,291
&gt;&gt; MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU.

228
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,000
BYE, BERNICE.

229
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,041
&gt;&gt; BYE.

230
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,667
&gt;&gt; ( woman): PLEASE, DON'T DO
THIS.

231
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,417
I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

232
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,291
&gt;&gt; ( man ): I'M SORRY, MRS.

233
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,000
RUMSEN, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN
DO.

234
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,875
&gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS MY HOME!

235
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:06,792
22 YEARS!

236
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,542
&gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE PAYMENTS.

237
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:09,458
THEY FORECLOSED.

238
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,166
&gt;&gt; GIVE ME MORE TIME. PLEASE!

239
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,125
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

240
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,041
WE'LL TAKE YOU TO THE SHELTER.

241
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,125
YOU CAN STAY THERE A WEEK.

242
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,125
&gt;&gt; SHELTER?

243
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,834
( sobbing )

244
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,166
&gt;&gt; ( whistle blowing )

245
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,083
&gt;&gt; PLEASE. PLEASE, SIR.

246
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,291
MY FAMILY'S GOING HUNGRY.

247
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,417
MY CHILD NEEDS MEDICINE.

248
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,750
&gt;&gt; SURE.

249
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:46,583
&gt;&gt; ( coins jingle )
&gt;&gt; I WISH IT COULD BE MORE.

250
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,542
&gt;&gt; BLESS YOU, SIR.

251
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,542
&gt;&gt; ( men talking )

252
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,291
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT LETTIN' ANYBODY

253
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,250
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT ABOUT THE JOBS?

254
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,583
I'M A SKILLED ELECTRICIAN.

255
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,458
&gt;&gt; WE'RE ALL SKILLED
ELECTRICIANS HERE, PAL.

256
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,583

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,250
&gt;&gt; STAY BACK! STAY BACK!

259
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,792
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN OUT HERE ALL NIGHT!

260
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,583
&gt;&gt; I WORKED NINE YEARS FOR THE
FORD MOTOR COMPANY!

261
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,458
I CAME ALL THE WAY FROM DETROIT!

262
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,667
&gt;&gt; NOBODY ASKED YOU TO.

263
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,583
I WANT YOU ALL TO GO HOME!

264
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,959
&gt;&gt; LOOK -- THERE'S AN AD!

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,792

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,125

00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,041
&gt;&gt; MY MOM SAID SO.

334
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,625
SHE HEARD IT ON THE STREETS.

335
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,667
&gt;&gt; WELL, SHE'S WRONG.

336
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,583
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CALLING MY MOM A
LIAR?

337
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,625
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE LIAR.

338
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,417
&gt;&gt; THEN WHY IS HE IN JAIL?

339
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,875
&gt;&gt; STOP PICKING ON HER,

340
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,625
CHARLENE.

341
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,792
&gt;&gt; HE'S NOT IN JAIL.

342
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,250
HE'S IN KANSAS CITY.

343
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,417
&gt;&gt; HE IS TOO IN JAIL.

344
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,208
YOUR FATHER IS A MURDERER.

345
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,083
BERNICE'S FATHER IS A MURDERER!

346
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,125
♪ BERNICE'S FATHER
♪ IS A MURDERER

347
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:41,792
&gt;&gt; HE IS NOT!

348
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:42,917
TAKE IT BACK!

349
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,208
MY FATHER IS NOT A MURDERER!

350
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:49,208
&gt;&gt; ( both yelling )
&gt;&gt; STOP IT!

351
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,834
CHARLENE, STOP IT!

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,333
&gt;&gt; BERNICE, STOP IT!

353
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,125
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU CHILDREN ALONE
FOR A MINUTE!

354
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,625
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
TROUBLE IT WAS FOR ME TO COME

355
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:04,875
DOWN HERE?

356
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,709
I HAD TO LEAVE MRS. FINCH'S
LAUNDRY AND NOW I'LL BE LATE

357
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,792
WITH IT.

358
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,917
WHAT POSSESSED YOU TO ATTACK
THAT GIRL?

359
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,500
&gt;&gt; SHE CALLED MY FATHER A
MURDERER.

360
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,959
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR
FIGHTING.

361
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,208
&gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

362
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,458
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUNG LADIES DON'T
FIGHT.

363
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,375
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DEAL
WITH PEOPLE.

364
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:18,125
&gt;&gt; I WON'T LET ANYONE CALL HIM A
MURDERER!

365
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,959
&gt;&gt; YOU WILL BEHAVE YOURSELF IS
WHAT YOU'LL DO, AND YOU WILL

366
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:21,959
LEAVE YOUR FATHER TO ME.

367
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:22,959
IS THAT CLEAR?

368
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,125
&gt;&gt; SHE CALLED MY FATHER A
MURDERER.

369
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,375
WHY ARE YOU SO MAD AT ME?

370
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:31,375
WHAT DID I DO THAT WAS SO
TERRIBLE?

371
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,291
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT MAD AT YOU, BERNICE.

372
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,125
&gt;&gt; YOU SURE SEEM LIKE IT
SOMETIMES.

373
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,291
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

374
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:47,041
( sighs )
I'M JUST MAD AT THE WORLD FOR

375
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,500
THIS LOUSY DEPRESSION.

376
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:53,125
AND I'M MAD AT THOSE PEOPLE IN
KANSAS CITY FOR WHAT THEY'VE

377
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,667
DONE TO YOUR FATHER, FOR NOT
LETTING HIM GO.

378
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:59,542
AND I'M MAD BECAUSE I'M HAVING
TROUBLE FINDING A LAWYER TO HELP

379
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:03,291
HIM, AND I'M MAD AT MYSELF FOR
NOT BEING STRONGER.

380
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,875
&gt;&gt; I'M MAD, TOO.

381
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,125
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU ARE.

382
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,750
AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE.

383
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:11,041
BUT YOU HAVE TO STAY OUT OF
TROUBLE AT SCHOOL, AND YOU HAVE

384
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,667
TO COME STRAIGHT HOME TO HELP
WITH YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER

385
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,542
UNTIL YOUR AUNT MARGARET GETS
HERE.

386
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,542
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP NOW.

387
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:21,208
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO HELP GET DADDY
HOME.

388
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,250
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU DO, SWEETHEART.

389
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:26,834
BUT LET MOMMY TAKE CARE OF THAT.

390
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,917
YOU'RE NOT TO WORRY.

391
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:33,041
&gt;&gt; "DEAR FATHER, I MISS YOU SO
MUCH.

392
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,959
TODAY AT SCHOOL CHARLENE SAID
YOU WERE A MURDERER AND WE HAD A

393
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,041
FIGHT.

394
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,917
I TRIED TO BE NICE, BUT I
COULDN'T.

395
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:44,166
I GOT IN A COUPLE OF GOOD
PUNCHES BEFORE MISS KNIGHT BROKE

396
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,750
US UP.

397
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,083
AS PUNISHMENT, I HAVE TO WRITE
AN EXTRA REPORT ON PRESIDENT

398
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,333
HOOVER.

399
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,250
HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS TO,
YOU KNOW.

400
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:54,208
I WISH HE COULD HELP YOU GET
HOME.

401
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,458
I NEED YOU HERE."

402
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,500
&gt;&gt; THAT CHARLENE THINKS SHE'S SO
IMPORTANT.

403
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,041
YOU GOT HER GOOD.

404
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,208
&gt;&gt; IT'S TRUE MY FATHER'S IN
JAIL -- BUT HE SHOULDN'T BE.

405
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,291
HE DIDN'T EVEN HIT THAT MAN.

406
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,667
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO
HIM?

407
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,583
&gt;&gt; HE'LL GET OUT AND HE'LL COME
HOME.

408
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,625
&gt;&gt; HOW?

409
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:20,625
&gt;&gt; THEY'LL FIND OUT HE DIDN'T DO
IT.

410
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,458
&gt;&gt; WHAT IF THEY DON'T FIND OUT?

411
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,792
LIKE, WHAT IF THEY KEEP ON
THINKING IT'S HIM AND THEY NEVER

412
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,667
LET HIM GO?

413
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,625
&gt;&gt; ( man ): WE'VE GOT AN
EYEWITNESS.

414
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,375
&gt;&gt; THE MAN WHO DID IT RAN AWAY.

415
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:33,041
&gt;&gt; Y OU RAN.

416
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,083
&gt;&gt; I WAS AFRAID.

417
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,083
&gt;&gt; OF BEING CAUGHT?

418
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,583
&gt;&gt; NO, I--JUST AFRAID.

419
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,917
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE STAYED--
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THE

420
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:39,750
NAME OF YOUR ACCOMPLICE.

421
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:40,542
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO ACCOMPLICE!

422
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:41,875
&gt;&gt; YOU DID IT ON YOUR OWN?

423
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,166
&gt;&gt; NO!

424
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,208
WHY WOULD I DO SOMETHING TO GET
MYSELF THROWN IN JAIL?

425
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,208
I HAVE A FAMILY.

426
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,041
LOOK.

427
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,208
LOOK!

428
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:53,500
THEY'RE NO SO DIFFERENT THAN
YOUR OWN.

429
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,542
&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO TAKE
CARE OF THEM.

430
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,875
WAIT! PLEASE!

431
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:06,792
&gt;&gt; I NEED A CHANCE HERE!

432
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,709
HEY!

433
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,333
&gt;&gt; PLEASE LET ME FIND A WAY
TO HELP DADDY.

434
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,458
MOMMY CAN'T FIND A LAWYER, AND
SHE NEEDS HIM HOME.

435
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:37,291
SO DO I--AND SO DOES LILLY AND
JACK.

436
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,417
I CAN'T LET HIM STAY IN JAIL.

437
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,166
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY.

438
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:55,208
&gt;&gt; I BETTER GO DOWNSTAIRS AND
START DINNER AFTER THIS ONE.

439
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,166
&gt;&gt; NO, ANNIE.

440
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,583
YOU'VE WORKED ALL DAY LONG.

441
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,709
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH IRONING.

442
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,709
LOOK, I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

443
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,542
THAT'S WHAT SISTERS ARE FOR.

444
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:08,125
LATER I'LL GET THE DINNER
AND YOU CAN STAY UP HERE AND

445
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,333
REST.

446
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,083
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA
DO, MAGGIE.

447
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,667
I'VE TRIED TO CALL HIM AGAIN,
AND THEY STILL WON'T LET ME TALK

448
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:16,709
TO HIM.

449
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:17,875
THEY WON'T EVEN TELL ME HOW HE
IS.

450
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,625
&gt;&gt; HE'S A STRONG MAN, HE'LL BE
ALL RIGHT.

451
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,709
&gt;&gt; BUT THE LAWYERS ALL WANT
THEIR MONEY UP FRONT.

452
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:29,834
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA HELP
ANGUS.

453
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:34,125
&gt;&gt; EAT YOUR MEAT, JACK, IT'LL
MAKE YOU BIG AND STRONG.

454
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,709
&gt;&gt; MAGIC DOG DOESN'T LIKE IT.

455
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,625
&gt;&gt; WELL, MAGIC DOG DOESN'T HAVE
TO EAT IT--YOU DO. GO AHEAD.

456
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,500
&gt;&gt; THAT TASTES YUCK.

457
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:46,250
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING IS YUCK RIGHT NOT,
BUT IT'LL GET BETTER.

458
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,500
&gt;&gt; I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN SAY
THAT, AUNT MARGARET.

459
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,291
NOT WHEN DADDY'S STILL IN JAIL.

460
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,250
&gt;&gt; I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN.

461
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,417
&gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH?

462
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,041
WHAT IF THEY DON'T LET HIM GO?

463
00:24:59,208 --> 00:24:59,750
WHAT THEN?

464
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,583
&gt;&gt; THEY'LL LET HIM GO.

465
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,083
I'LL FIND A LAWYER.

466
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,125
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

467
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,834
AND I WANT YOU TO STOP THIS
RIGHT NOW!

468
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,917
&gt;&gt; NOTHING WILL BE RIGHT UNTIL
HE'S HOME!

469
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,583
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA
DO WITH BERNICE.

470
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,041
&gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T MEAN HALF OF WHAT
SHE SAYS.

471
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,417
IT'S JUST A STAGE.

472
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,291
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, I KNOW.

473
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,667
SHE'S STILL GROWING UP.

474
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,583
AND I NEED MORE PATIENCE.

475
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,625
BUT SOMETIMES SHE CAN JUST BE SO
STUBBORN.

476
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:31,667
&gt;&gt; LIKE SOMEONE ELSE I KNOW.

477
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:35,041
GIVE HER TIME TO FIND HERSELF.

478
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,000
EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE ON WITH
ANGUS...

479
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:38,792
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

480
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,166
I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE,

481
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,500
MAGGIE.

482
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:48,875
I HAVE TO KNOW THAT HE'S ALL
RIGHT.

483
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,250
I'M GOING TO THE POLICE STATION.

484
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,667
AND SERGEANT ANDERSON IS GONNA
GET THE POLICE IN KANSAS CITY TO

485
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,166
LET ME TALK TO MY ANGUS.

486
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:00,083
AND I'M GONNA STAY THERE UNTIL
THEY DO, I SWEAR IT!

487
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,083
&gt;&gt; GO IN THE MORNING, ANNIE,
AFTER YOU'RE HAD SOME REST.

488
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,709
&gt;&gt; NO. NO, I'M GOING NOW.

489
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:09,750
THEY'RE NOT GONNA KEEP ME FROM
MY HUSBAND.

490
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,250
&gt;&gt; ( Hoover on radio ):
I PROMISED YOU A CHICKEN IN

491
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,875
EVERY POT, AND I INTEND TO KEEP
THAT PROMISE. BUT IT WILL

492
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,500
REQUIRE YOUR CONTINUED FAITH.

493
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:22,458
IT WILL TAKE TIME AND BELIEF IN
THE SOUNDNESS OF THE AMERICAN

494
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,250
WAY OF DOING THINGS.

495
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,000
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK HE CAN DO
ANYTHING?

496
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,041
&gt;&gt; I HOPE SO.

497
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,000
THERE'S SO MUCH THAT NEEDS

HE'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU
WANT.

HE'S A TYCOON, HE'S WORTH A
MILLION BUCKS.

00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,542
I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE HIM RIGHT
NOW.

601
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,875
&gt;&gt; I'M VERY HUNGRY.

00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,125
CAN WE GET SOMETHING TO EAT NOW,
BERNICE?

604
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,166

ENOUGH MONEY.

605
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,542
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED MONEY WHEN
YOU'RE TRAVELING WITH ME.

606
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:10,625
MY FATHER'S GOT AN ACCOUNT WITH
THIS RAILROAD.

609
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,417
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

610
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:28,834
&gt;&gt; YES. I PLAYED A WEE BIT OF
MOZART AND THEN I WENT UPSTAIRS

611
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,125
AND PEEKED IN ON THEM, AND THEY
WERE SLEEPING LIKE ANGELS.

612
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,250
&gt;&gt; I WAITED AND WAITED AT THE
POLICE STATION UNTIL THEY

613
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:38,917
FINALLY DECIDED TO CALL THE JAIL
IN KANSAS CITY, AND THE PEOPLE

614
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,166
THERE WOULDN'T EVEN PUT ANGUS ON
THE PHONE.

615
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,792
&gt;&gt; DID THEY TELL YOU ANYTHING?

616
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:45,583
&gt;&gt; THEY SAID HE WAS ALL RIGHT,
BUT I'LL FEEL BETTER WHEN I HEAR

617
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,667
IT FROM HIM.

618
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,500
I'LL HAVE TO GO LOOKING FOR A
LAWYER IN THE MORNING.

619
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,625
THAT FOREMAN IS STILL
UNCONSCIOUS, AND IF HE DIES,

620
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:54,125
THEY'LL BLAME ANGUS.

621
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:59,917
&gt;&gt; THEY'LL FIND OUT IT WASN'T
HIM AND THEY'LL LET HIM GO.

622
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:00,917
&gt;&gt; OHH...

623
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,417
&gt;&gt; IT'S LATE.

624
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:06,667
I'LL GO UP AND GET MY BAG, I
LEFT IT IN THE GIRLS' ROOM.

625
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:07,667
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

626
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:09,792
I'LL MAKE UP THE COUCH.

627
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:12,250
&gt;&gt; I'LL DO IT LATER, ANNIE.

628
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,959
&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL RIGHT.

629
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:17,959
&gt;&gt; ( chuckling )
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO

630
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,000
SHARE A BED?

631
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,291

TALKING?

632
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:25,959
&gt;&gt; YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU WOULDN'T,
BUT YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

633
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,709
GET US IN TROUBLE.

634

&gt;&gt; WE WERE GIRLS THEN, ANNIE.

635
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,458
&gt;&gt; SEEMS SO LONG AGO NOW,
MAGGIE.

636
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,000
ANOTHER LIFETIME.

637
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,917
&gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

638
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,709

HAS CONNECTIONS.

646
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:05,250
THE DINING ROOM IS CLOSED AND SO
IS THE KITCHEN, BUT THEY HAD TO

647
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,125
HELP ME OR I WOULD HAVE TURNED
IN THEIR NAMES.

648
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,709
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,750
&gt;&gt; NOT ME, THANKS, I'M FULL.

650

I HAD--THE WORKS.

651

00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,166
&gt;&gt; YES, I CAN, I HAVE TO.

665
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:56,458
I'M THEIR MOTHER.

666
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:59,041
&gt;&gt; I SPOKE TO A CLERK AT THE
TRAIN STATION, MA'AM.

667
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:03,709
HE SAID HE SAW THREE CHILDREN,
TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, BUT THAT HE

668
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,125
TOLD THEM TO GO HOME.

669
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:07,291
&gt;&gt; OH. WELL, THEY DIDN'T COME
HOME.

670
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,458
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

671
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,083
&gt;&gt; THE OLDEST ONE ASKED ABOUT A
TRAIN TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

672
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,250
HE TOLD HER TO TAKE THE 11:45 TO
COLUMBUS AND CHANGE THERE, BUT

673
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,959
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
FOR A TICKET.

674
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,709
THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF
RUNAWAYS OUT THERE, MRS. FEAGAN,

675
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:28,166
AND I CAN'T PROMISE THAT--
&gt;&gt; MY CHILDREN AREN'T RUNAWAYS.

676
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,917
THEY WENT TO HELP THEIR FATHER.

677
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:33,959
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, JUST
THROW YOUR HANDS UP AND SAY

678
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,250
NOTHING CAN WE DONE?

679
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:37,583
&gt;&gt; WE WILL DO OUR VERY BEST.

680
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,083
AND WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN
SOMETHING COMES UP.

681
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,959
NOW EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

682
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,417
&gt;&gt; MAGGIE, HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU
HAVE WITH YOU?

683
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,333
&gt;&gt; I HAVE SOME.

684
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,667
&gt;&gt; I'M GONNA NEED IT.

685
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,542
I'M GOING TO COLUMBUS AFTER
THEM.

686
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,417
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
THAT'S WHERE THEY WENT.

687
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,041
&gt;&gt; YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.

688
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,500
SHE ASKED ABOUT GOING TO
WASHINGTON.

689
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:05,458
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO,
BUT I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

690
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,583
WOULD YOU PLEASE STAY HERE IN
CASE THEY CALL?

691
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,625
&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD LEAVE THIS TO THE

692
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:09,750
POLICE, ANNIE.

693
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,125
&gt;&gt; THE POLICE DIDN'T DO VERY
WELL BY ANGUS, DID THEY?

694
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,166
I'LL FIND THEM MYSELF.

695
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,875
&gt;&gt; IT WAS VERY NICE MEETING YOU
ALL.

696
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,834
I HOPE THE PRESIDENT HELPS YOUR
FATHER.

697
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,542
&gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD VISIT
WITH YOUR FATHER.

698
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,083
&gt;&gt; ( woman ): THAT'S HIM!

699
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:27,959
COME ALONG, LEE.

700
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,917
&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HIM?

701
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,500
&gt;&gt; BACK TO THE ORPHANAGE
HE RAN AWAY FROM.

702
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,125
WHERE ARE YO UR PARENTS?

703
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,333
&gt;&gt; ON THE TRAIN.

704
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,208
&gt;&gt; DON'T TRUST ANYBODY, SEE?

705
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,667
KEEP ONE EYE ON WHERE YOU'RE
GOING AND THE OTHER ONE ON WHERE

706
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:44,500

707
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,291
&gt;&gt; ( conductor ):
HEY, YOU KIDS!

00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:51,625
&gt;&gt; STOP THOSE KIDS!

710
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:52,792
I WANT THOSE KIDS!

711
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,041
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TICKETS!

712
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:54,959
&gt;&gt; WATCH IT!

713
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:55,917
&gt;&gt; SORRY. SORRY.

714
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,583
MY FAULT. SORRY, SIR.

715
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,375
STOP THEM! STOP THEM!

716
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,458
&gt;&gt; HURRY!

717
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:12,166
&gt;&gt; I SAW THEM RUN THIS WAY.

718
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,291
THEY GOTTA BE AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE.

719
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,125
&gt;&gt; ARE THEY GONNA CATCH US?

720
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:18,959
&gt;&gt; NO.

721
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,542
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO HOME.

722
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:22,750
&gt;&gt; I WISH YOU WE RE HOME.

723
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,583
&gt;&gt; HUH. ONE THING I'LL TELL YA,
IF THEY'RE ON THE FREIGHT, THE

724
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,166
BULL WILL TAKE CARE OF 'EM.

725
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:31,250
HE'S THE MEANEST BULL IN THE
YARDS.

726
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:34,625
LET'S CHECK THE PASSENGER CAR.

727
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,417
&gt;&gt; ( panting )
&gt;&gt; COME ON.

728
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,750
&gt;&gt; COME ON.

729
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,792
THERE WE GO.

730
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:07,709
&gt;&gt; ( bat hitting wall )
&gt;&gt; QUIET. MAYBE HE WON'T

731
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:08,875
LOOK IN.

732
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:14,000
&gt;&gt; ( man ): OH,
HE'LL BE LOOKIN' IN HERE,

733
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:15,667
HE WILL.

734
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,792
YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

735
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,709
HE LIKES CHILDREN,
OLD BULL DOES.

736
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:33,458
HE EATS 'EM FOR BREAKFAST.

737
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,542
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANNA BE BREAKFAST.

738
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:36,875
&gt;&gt; HEH.

739
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:46,542
AND WHEN HE GETS DONE, HE PICKS
HIS TEETH WITH A STEEL SPIKE.

740
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,125
&gt;&gt; HA HA...

741
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,959
&gt;&gt; TOP OF THE MORNIN' TO YOU,
MORON.

742
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,500

A MAN ON THE HEAD WITH A

767
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,583
CROWBAR IN KANSAS CITY.

768
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,208
&gt;&gt; ( sighs )
THAT'S SERIOUS.

769
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:45,083

770
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,291
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,208
&gt;&gt; AMERICAN.

774
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,875
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU ON A FREIGHT
TRAIN?

775
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:01,166
&gt;&gt; I MIGHT ASK YOU THE SAME
QUESTION.

776
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,917
&gt;&gt; I ASKED YOU FIRST.

777
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:06,000
&gt;&gt; INDEED. HA HA!

778
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,583
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

I'M A MAN OF THE WORLD,

780
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:13,959
A WORLD TRAVELER.

781
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:19,834
HA HA! YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT
TO LOOK AT ME NOW, BUT ONCE UPON

782
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,542
A TIME, CHILDREN, THESE HANDS
HELD THE DESTINY OF MANKIND.

783
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,667
I WAS ON WALL STREET...

784
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:29,583
THE VERY PLAYPEN OF THE RICH.

785
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,625
AND I A MAKER OF FORTUNES,
HELD THE DESTINY OF MANKIND.

786
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:35,166
I WAS ON WALL STREET...

787
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,750
THE VERY PLAYPEN OF THE RICH.

788
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:40,041
AND I A MAKER OF FORTUNES,
A REGULAR WHEELER-DEALER,

789
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:45,041
A BIG-TIME CHARLIE, IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

790
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,291
THEN CAME THE CRASH.

791
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:50,041
WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF WORK,
YOU'RE OUT OF WORK.

792
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:53,250
AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY
DIFFERENCE WHAT KIND OF WORK IT

793
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,166
WAS.

794
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,542
&gt;&gt; OUR FATHER'S OUT OF WORK.

795
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:59,250
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS THIS TRAIN GOING?

796
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:04,458
&gt;&gt; WE'RE HEADED TO PARKERSBURG,

803
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,792
&gt;&gt; I WON'T DO IT.

804
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:03,291
I'LL GET DIRTY AND I'LL HURT
MYSELF.

805
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,792
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE DIRT NEVER HURT
ANYBODY.

806
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:10,667
&gt;&gt; I'M JUMPING, AND SO IS MAGIC
DOG.

807
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:13,166

00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,625
WE'RE NOT GOING.

809
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:18,166
&gt;&gt; THE BULLS IN PARKERSBURG ARE
BRUTAL.

810
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:24,875
&gt;&gt; ( sighs )
HOW DO I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU?

811
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,709
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T.

812
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:33,417
&gt;&gt; HOW DO WE GET OUT OF HERE?

813
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:39,125
&gt;&gt; BY BENDING YOUR KNEES AND
ROLLING WHEN YOU HIT, LIKE THIS.

814
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:47,750
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT,
BERNICE.

815
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:49,542
I'M DON'T WANT TO.

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,166
JUMP, LILLY, JUMP!

822
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,583
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT THE MAKINGS OF A
FIRST-RATE HOBO, BOY!

823
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,709
&gt;&gt; SO DO YOU.

824
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,375
WILL YOU TEACH ME HOW?

825
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:19,625
&gt;&gt; HA HA HA!

826
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:21,458
WHAT I CAN, WHAT I CAN.

827
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,667
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

828
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:24,583
&gt;&gt; NO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

829
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,500
&gt;&gt; I'M OKAY.

WHY IS CALLED HOOVERVILLE?

838
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,959

839
00:45:55,125 --> 00:46:00,208
&gt;&gt; ( owl hoots )
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT. I DON'T LIKE IT.

840
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,792
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST AN OWL.

841
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:04,458
&gt;&gt; ARE THEY POISON?

842
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:07,834
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, I NEVER ATE
ONE.

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,458

848
00:46:20,959 --> 00:46:22,375

861
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,542
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE HERE
ANYMORE.

862
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:52,500
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE ON MY TRAIN WITHOUT
TICKETS.

863
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:55,208
I CHASED THEM, BUT THEY GOT AWAY
FROM ME IN THE YARDS.

THERE WAS A FREIGHT FOR
PARKERSBURG THAT PULLED OUT JUST

865
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:58,792

PARKERSBURG MYSELF...

&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU CARE FOR HALF A
SANDWICH?

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

911
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,166
&gt;&gt; LOOK, LADY, I TOLD THE COPS,
I'LL TELL YOU.

912
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,792
WHEN THAT FREIGHT TRAIN PULLED
IN HERE, NOBODY WAS ON IT.

913
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:09,250
&gt;&gt; BUT THEY HAD TO BE ON IT.

914
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:12,166
&gt;&gt; NOT WHEN IT ARRIVED, NOT WHEN
IT LEFT.

915
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:16,250
WE GOT A THING ABOUT THAT IN

916
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:17,458
PARKERSBURG.

917
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:20,750
YOU OKAY, LADY?

918
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,083
YOU WANT SOMETHING?

919
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,959
&gt;&gt; I JUST HAVE TO THINK THIS
THROUGH.

920
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:27,625
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

921
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,083
RIGHT HERE.

922
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:37,208
&gt;&gt; SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY
ARE, I'LL HAVE TO GO WHERE

923
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,125
THEY'RE HEADED.

924
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,166
I HAVE TO FIND MY KIDS, MISTER.

925
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,458
WHEN IS THE NEXT TRAIN TO
WASHINGTON?

926
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,458
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT TILL TOMORROW,
MA'AM.

927
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,208
BUT I GOT A COUSIN WHO'S DRIVING
THAT WAY TODAY,

928
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,166
IF THAT'D BE A HELP.

929
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:57,500
&gt;&gt; YES. YES, IT WOULD.

930
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,792
&gt;&gt; IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO TAKE
ME ALL THIS WAY, MR. NEEDLES.

931
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,875
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU NEED A RIDE, AND I
WAS HEADING IN THE RIGHT

932
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,125
DIRECTION.

933
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:09,208
ANYWAY, I KIND OF GOT A SOFT
SPOT FOR KIDS.

934
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:13,083
&gt;&gt; BERNICE IS 12, LILLY'S 9, AND
JACK IS 6.

935
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,583
I HAVE A PICTURE.

936
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,000
THEY'RE VERY WELL BEHAVED,
AND THEY ALL GET GOOD GRADES IN

937
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:18,667
SCHOOL.

938
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:20,875
ANGUS AND I MAKE SURE THEY DO
EVERY BIT OF THEIR HOMEWORK.

939
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,333
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING BUNCH.

940
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:22,917
WHO'S THIS?

941
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,000
&gt;&gt; THAT'S LILLY.

942
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:26,000
SHE HAS AN EXCELLENT SINGING
VOICE.

943
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,625
AND JACK, HE'S A REAL DAREDEVIL.

944
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:31,709
HE'S FEARLESS..AND FUNNY.

945
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,250
&gt;&gt; IS THIS THE OLDEST?

946
00:51:33,417 --> 00:51:35,000
&gt;&gt; YES, THAT'S BERNICE.

947
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,583
SHE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL.

948
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:39,792
I WISH I TOLD HER.

949
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:41,500
I HOPE SHE KNOWS.

950
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:45,709
BUT I'VE HAD TO SPEND SO MUCH
TIME WITH LILLY AND JACK, AND

951
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:48,166
BERNICE IS GETTING SO GROWN UP.

952
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:52,583
WHEREVER THEY ARE, I'M SURE
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

953
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:07,125
&gt;&gt; WELL, THIS IS WHERE WE PART
COMPANY.

954

00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:49,250
AND TWO CARS IN EVERY GARAGE!

996
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:50,875
THAT'S MY MOTTO.

997
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:55,542
I'M BUSY RUNNING THE COUNTRY AT
THE MOMENT, SO I'VE ONLY GOT A

998
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:58,291
MINUTE, BUT I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE

999
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,333
SHOW.

1000
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:05,208
BUT FIRST, PUT YOUR PENNIES HERE
ON THE STAGE.

1001
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:08,875
HA HA HA!

1002
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:11,792
A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED.

1003
00:54:11,959 --> 00:54:13,750
&gt;&gt; WE CAN'T STAY LONG.

1004
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,959
&gt;&gt; IT'S A SHORT SHOW.

1005
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,250
&gt;&gt; OH!

1006
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:21,542
( imitates chicken squawking )
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT A CHICKEN IN

1007
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:22,458
EVERY POT?

1008
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:23,583
&gt;&gt; HA HA HA!

1009
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,166
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU COME FROM?

1010
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,458
&gt;&gt; FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

1011
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:30,625
&gt;&gt; WHY DID YOU CROSS THE STREET,
MR. CHICKEN?

1012
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:33,375
&gt;&gt; TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE,
MR. PRESIDENT.

1013
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:36,000
&gt;&gt; HA HA HA HA!

1014
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:37,917
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

1015
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:45,709
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR A
ROWBOAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

1016
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:47,500
OCEAN, LOOKIN' FOR 'EM LIKE
THIS.

1017
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:50,291
&gt;&gt; YOU'LL FIND 'EM.

1018
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:53,208
&gt;&gt; AT LEAST I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE
GOING.

1019
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:55,000
SO MANY CHILDREN ARE RUNNING

1020
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:59,709
AWAY FROM HOME THESE DAYS AND
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE.

1021
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:01,917
IT REALLY BREAKS YOUR HEART.

1022
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:03,875
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT A STICK?

1023
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,417
&gt;&gt; OH, NO, THANK YOU.

1024
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:07,500
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE--?

1025
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:08,834
OH, THAT LOOKS BAD.

1026
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,750
&gt;&gt; THAT LOOKS LIKE LILLY!

1027
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,500
OH, PLEASE, GOD, IT CAN'T BE
THEM!

1028
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:17,208
NO, IT CAN'T BE, IT CAN'T!

1029
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,500
WE SKIDDED, MUST HAVE HIT SOME
ICE.

1030
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,959
&gt;&gt; I'M JUST GLAD WE CAME ALONG.

1031
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,542
THERE YOU GO, DARLING.

1032
00:55:24,709 --> 00:55:26,959
YOU'LL BE GOOD AS NEW IN THE
MORNING.

1033
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:28,417
SHE LOOKS ALL RIGHT.

1034
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,583
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN SO FINE WITH HER.

1035
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,333
GOT ANY OF YOUR OWN?

1036
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,375
&gt;&gt; YES.

1037
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:36,500
&gt;&gt; BYE, MR. HANDY!

1038
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,458
&gt;&gt; CALL ME ANDY!

1039
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:43,333
AND DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER
FROM PRESIDENT HOOVER.

1040
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,125
BE BOLD!

1041
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,917
&gt;&gt; WE WILL.

1042
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:53,000
TIME FOR LUNCH, HORTENSE.

1043
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:57,375
&gt;&gt; ( neighs )
&gt;&gt; HERE YOU GO, MR. NEEDLES.

1044
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:58,917
&gt;&gt; OH, THANK YOU.

1045
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:00,667
THE OTHER ONE'S FOR YOU.

1046
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:02,208
&gt;&gt; OH, NO, I COULDN'T.

1047
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:05,125
&gt;&gt; WELL, I COULDN'T EAT IT,
OTHERWISE.

1048
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:08,625
LET'S POUR OUT A BIT OF THAT
COFFEE, WE'LL SHARE THAT, TOO.

1049
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:12,125
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

1050
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:32,208
&gt;&gt; IF MY SON SAW THAT HORSE AND
WAGON, HE'D GO AFTER IT LIKE A

1051
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:33,875
LOOSE NAIL TO A MAGNET.

1052
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,625
HELLO!

1053
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,000
&gt;&gt; ANDREW HANDY AND HIS MAGICAL
THEATER AT YOUR DISPOSAL!

1054
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:42,166
&gt;&gt; MY NAME IS ANNIE FEAGAN,
AND I'M LOOKING FOR MY THREE

1055
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,000
CHILDREN.

1056
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:45,000
&gt;&gt; WOULD THAT BE BERNICE, LILLY
AND JACK?

1057
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,709
&gt;&gt; OH! YOU SAW THEM!

1058
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,125
THEY WERE ALL RIGHT?

1059
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:49,834
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE A-NUMBER ONE!

1060
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,500
ON THEIR WAY TO WASHINGTON TO
SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

1061
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:54,375
STATES TO GET THEIR FATHER OUT
OF JAIL!

1062
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:56,041
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT!

1063
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,583
WHEN DID YOU SEE THEM?

1064
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,542
&gt;&gt; THEY WENT DOWN THE ROAD
ABOUT, OH, AN HOUR, MAYBE

1065
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:01,333
45 MINUTES AGO.

1066
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,291
&gt;&gt; OH, THANK YOU, MR. HANDY!

1067
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,208
&gt;&gt; CALL ME ANDY!

1068
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:07,166
&gt;&gt; BLESS YOU, ANDY!

1069
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,917
MR. NEEDLES, THEY WERE HERE!

1070
00:57:13,417 --> 00:57:16,709
THEY WERE JUST UP THE ROAD
A BIT.

1071
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:24,000
&gt;&gt; I'M COLD.

1072
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:26,000
WHERE ARE WE NOW?

1073
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:28,583
&gt;&gt; WE'RE RIGHT ABOUT...

1074
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,166
HERE.

1075
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:31,583
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOWHERE!

1076
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,667
THERE ISN'T EVEN A NAME!

1077
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:36,375
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

1078
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:37,041
WE'RE LOST.

1079
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:38,542
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOST.

1080
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,333
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US IF
WE DON'T GET ANOTHER RIDE?

1081
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,875
HOW WILL WE EVER GET HOME?

1082
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,792
&gt;&gt; LOOK! THERE'S A CAR!

1083
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:02,667
&gt;&gt; ( slurred ): HEY, HOP IN,
KIDS, THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM.

1084
00:58:02,834 --> 00:58:03,375
&gt;&gt; LILLY!

1085
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:05,166
&gt;&gt; IT'S NICE AND WARM.

1086
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,917
&gt;&gt; AAAH!

1087
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,375
LET ME GO!

1088
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:12,000
JACK, HELP ME!

1089
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,875
&gt;&gt; OWWW!

1090
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,625
COME ON, LILLY!

1091
00:58:19,709 --> 00:58:21,917
&gt;&gt; WAY TO GO, JACK!

1092
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,333
&gt;&gt; I'LL KILL YOU KIDS
IF I CATCH YOU!

1093
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:24,917
&gt;&gt; ( Jack ): IT WASN'T ME.

1094
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,500
MAGIC DOG BIT HIM.

1095
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:38,250
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

1096
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:40,125
&gt;&gt; A BARN, MAYBE.

1097
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:41,917
&gt;&gt; LET'S STAY HERE.

1098
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:42,792
IT'S WARM.

1099
00:58:42,959 --> 00:58:45,166
&gt;&gt; GO CHECK.

1100
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:50,125
&gt;&gt; COME ON.

1101
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:51,959
GOOD. WE CAN SLEEP HERE.

1102
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:56,166
WE'LL GET AN EARLY START
HITCHING IN THE MORNING.

1103
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:03,917
&gt;&gt; WELL, MAYBE THEY'LL GET THE
GUY AND LET YOUR HUSBAND GO.

1104
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,125
&gt;&gt; I'M COUNTING ON THAT,
MR. NEEDLES.

1105
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:07,667
&gt;&gt; RAYMOND.

1106
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:09,875
EVERYONE CALLS ME RAY.

1107
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:13,834
&gt;&gt; I REFUSE TO BELIEVE YOU CAN
BE LOCKED UP FOR SOMETHING YOU

1108
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
DIDN'T DO.

1109
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:19,458
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I'M STAYING AT MY
COUSIN'S TONIGHT...

1110
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:21,959
IF YOU NEED A PLACE.

1111
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,125
I COULD TAKE YOU ANOTHER
40 MILES IN THE MORNING.

1112
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:27,250
YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR KIDS IN THE
DARK, AND WE'LL BE UNDERWAY AT

1113
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:28,792
FIRST LIGHT.

1114
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:35,500
&gt;&gt; SINCE I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO
GO, I'LL ACCEPT YOUR OFFER.

1115
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:37,291
THANK YOU.

1116
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:40,917
I'LL TAKE THE CHANCE YOU'RE
A GENTLEMAN.

1117
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:43,250
YOU ARE, AREN'T YOU?

1118
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,041
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM.

1119
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,583
&gt;&gt; GOOD.

1120
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:08,458
&gt;&gt; ( crying )
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW, LILLY.

1121
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:09,917
&gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT!

1122
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:12,709
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE!

1123
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:18,500
( crying )
&gt;&gt; I MISS MOMMY.

1124
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,709
&gt;&gt; WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

1125
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:25,458
IT'S A LOT EASIER TO KEEP GOING
THAN IT IS TO GO BACK.

1126
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:28,083
MOMMY WILL COME GET US IN
WASHINGTON.

1127
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,291
I'M SURE PRESIDENT HOOVER WILL
LET US CALL HER.

1128
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:37,375
I BET HE GIVES US SOME GOOD
THINGS TO EAT, TOO.

1129
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:40,291
BIG PIECES OF CAKE, AND ICE
CREAM...

1130
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:42,834
ALL WE WANT.

1131
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,667
AND WHEN HE HEARS WHY WE'VE
COME, HE'LL JUST CALL THOSE

1132
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:50,291
PEOPLE IN KANSAS CITY AND TELL
THEM TO LET OUR FATHER GO.

1133
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:53,500
HE'LL BE BACK IN DETROIT FOR
CHRISTMAS.

1134
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:57,041
IT'LL BE THE BEST CHRISTMAS
WE'VE EVER HAD.

1135
01:00:57,208 --> 01:01:02,709
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WHEN
WE GET TO SEE THE PRESIDENT.

1136
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:19,417
&gt;&gt; BYE!

1137
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:21,917
&gt;&gt; IT WAS SO GOOD OF YOUR COUSIN
TO TAKE ME IN.

1138
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,166
SHE HAS A LOVELY FAMILY.

1139
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,417
&gt;&gt; SHE REALLY ENJOYED YOU.

1140
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:25,917
SHE DOESN'T GET MUCH COMPANY.

1141
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,417
MY COUSIN EDDIE'S HEADING OVER
TO FRONT ROYAL THIS MORNING,

1142
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:32,291
THAT'S IN VIRGINIA, AND HE'D BE
REAL HAPPY TO GIVE YOU A RIDE.

1143
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:33,667
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

1144
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:35,917
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GONNA MEET 'EM
OUTSIDE OF CLARKSBURG.

1145
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,583
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A LOT OF COUSINS,
MR. NEEDLES.

1146
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,417
&gt;&gt; I SURELY DO, MRS. FEAGAN.

1147
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,959
LOTS OF 'EM.

1148
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:45,667
OH, AND...IT'S RAY.

1149
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:48,625
&gt;&gt; RAY.

1150
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,083
IT'S ANNIE.

1151
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:56,500
&gt;&gt; ( bell ringing )
&gt;&gt; HO HO HO!

1152
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:57,834
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

1153
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,667
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

1154
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:03,583
THANKS FOR TAKING US ALL THIS
WAY.

1155
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,458
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE WELCOME.

1156
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:05,834
AND MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU.

1157
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,834
&gt;&gt; MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1158
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,041
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO TALK TO SANTA

01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:49,875
&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?

1183
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:50,750

1186
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:57,333
HOOVER GOES TO WALL STREET!

1187
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,458
&gt;&gt; AT A DANCE.

1188
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:04,041
MY COUSIN --
WELL, I HAVE THEM, TOO --

1189
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:05,041
MADE ME GO.

1190
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:06,792
WELL, ACTUALLY SHE DRAGGED ME.

1191
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:11,750
SHE SAID I'D NEVER MEET A MAN
STAYING AT HOME, AND I MET

1192
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:12,166
ANGUS.

1193
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:13,750
I WAS NINETEEN.

1194
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:17,417
HE WAS THE FIRST MAN I'D EVER
REALLY BEEN OUT WITH.

1195
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:22,000
WE WERE BOTH SHY AROUND OTHER
PEOPLE BUT NOT WITH EACH OTHER.

1196
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:23,166
HA HA HA!

1197
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,208
NEITHER ONE OF US COULD DANCE
VERY WELL.

1198
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,583
BUT WE SURE COULD TALK, RIGHT
FROM THE FIRST WORD.

1199
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:33,417
IT WAS LIKE WE HAD KNOWN EACH
OTHER OUR WHOLE LIVES.

1200
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,709
I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
ANOTHER MAN SINCE THAT NIGHT.

1201
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:40,792
HE'S LIKE THE OTHER HALF OF ME
THAT WAS MISSING.

1202
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:43,375
HE SAYS THE SAME ABOUT ME.

1203
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:46,625
I SHOULDN'T BE TALKING OF SUCH
THINGS...

1204
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:51,208
BUT IF WE COULD LIVE TOGETHER

1205
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:57,291
FOREVER, IT WOULDN'T BE LONG
ENOUGH.

1206
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,625
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO.

1207
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:05,917
&gt;&gt; LILLY, I HAVE PUT UP WITH

1208
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:07,333

01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,208
STOP WHINING AND GET US ON THAT
BUS TO WASHINGTON.

1210
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,166

1211

THE COUNTRY LOOKING FOR WORK?

1214
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:24,917
YOU'RE GOING TO SING FOR US,
LILLY.

1215
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,625
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE.

1216
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:28,417
YOU CAN DO IT, LILLY.

1217
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:30,333
YOU HAVE TO DO IT, LILLY.

1218

1316
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:05,834
FATHER OUT OF JAIL.

1317
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,750
&gt;&gt; WE WANT OUR FATHER TO COME
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.

YOUR FATHER OUT OF JAIL?

1320
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:17,375
&gt;&gt; WE ARE.

1321
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:20,000
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, AND I
KNOW THE PRESIDENT WOULD HELP

1322
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:20,625
HIM IF HE KNEW.

1323
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,375
&gt;&gt; WELL, WOULDN'T THAT BE
SOMETHING--MEETING WITH THE

1324
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:24,375
PRESIDENT.

1325
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:26,458
WISH I COULD DO THAT MYSELF.

1326
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:28,208
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN COME WITH US.

1327
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:30,959
&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T THINK I COULD GET

1328
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:34,750
PAST THE GATE, AND I'M A
LITTLE OLD FOR SNEAKIN'.

1329
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:38,291
BUT YOU THREE LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
UP TO THE GAME.

1330
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,834
&gt;&gt; WE REALLY NEED TO SEE HIM.

1331
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,166
CAN YOU HELP US?

1332
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:45,125
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A PRETTY TALL ORDER.

1333
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:48,041
BUT THEN, I'M A TALL FELLA.

1334
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,500
&gt;&gt; ( horn honks )

1335
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:57,417
&gt;&gt; ( Hiram ): WHEN THAT TRUCK
GETS THROUGH, WE'LL START.

1336
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:58,542
GET HER UP.

1337
01:10:58,709 --> 01:11:00,166
&gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO.

1338
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,041
BE CAREFUL.

1339
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:04,583
&gt;&gt; DON'T GO UNTIL WE TELL YA.

1340
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,208
&gt;&gt; I WON'T.

1341
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,208
THANK YOU.

1342
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:11,083
&gt;&gt; SAY HELLO TO HOOVER FOR ME.

1343
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:15,834
&gt;&gt; COME ON, BOYS!

1344
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,458
WE WANT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT!

1345
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,208
&gt;&gt; I'M A CITIZEN!

1346
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:22,333
&gt;&gt; WE GOT OUR RIGHTS!

1347
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,667
&gt;&gt; ( all shouting )

1348
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:30,041
&gt;&gt; HIRAM, THEY'RE IN.

1349
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,125
&gt;&gt; OKAY, BOYS!

1351
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:42,625
&gt;&gt; ( Bernice ):
SOMEONE'S COMING.

1352
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,458
FOLLOW ME.

1353
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,291
&gt;&gt; STAY HERE, I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

1354
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:27,625
&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME.

1355
01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:31,083
COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE THE
PRESIDENT IS?

1356
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,709
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE!

1357
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:36,542
&gt;&gt; I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

1358
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:38,625
&gt;&gt; MY AUNT FANNY.

1359
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:39,208
CORPORAL!

1360
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:41,166
KID, COME HERE.

1361
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:42,625
&gt;&gt; COME ON!

1362
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:45,834
&gt;&gt; SOME KID JUST GOT IN HERE!

1363
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:48,792
&gt;&gt; ( clatter )

1364
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:06,083
&gt;&gt; WOW! THIS PLACE IS HUGE!

1365
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,709
&gt;&gt; IT'S FANTASTIC!

1366
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,959
&gt;&gt; SO, WHERE'S THE PRESIDENT,
BERNICE?

1367
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:13,291
&gt;&gt; WE'LL FIND HIM.

1368
01:13:15,709 --> 01:13:18,333
&gt;&gt; BOY, THIS IS SURE A BIG
HOUSE.

1369
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,709
&gt;&gt; I WONDER WHERE HE IS?

1370
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:23,750
&gt;&gt; THE WORD ON WALL STREET IS
THAT IT'LL TAKE 50 YEARS FOR THE

1371
01:13:23,917 --> 01:13:25,208
MARKET TO RECOVER.

1372
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:31,959
YOU'D THINK I WAS PERSONALLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT...

1373
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:34,458
THE WAY THEY WRITE ABOUT ME.

1374
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:37,625
&gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW
YOU REALLY FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS,

1375
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:39,208
THE PERSONAL SIDE OF IT.

1376
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:44,125
&gt;&gt; WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS TO
HAVE FAITH IN THE IDEA THAT

1377
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:48,417
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND THE
EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WILL PUT

1378
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:51,333
THIS COUNTRY BACK ON ITS FEET.

1379
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,166
&gt;&gt; THEY MUST BE UP HERE.

1380
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:55,417
SOME KID JUST SNEAKED INTO THE
BASEMENT!

1381
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,291
SHE MAY HAVE COME UP HERE.

1382
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:59,000
LET'S CHECK THE BALLROOM.

1383
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:01,583
&gt;&gt; I HEARD SOMEBODY UP HERE.

1384
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:11,875
&gt;&gt; NOTHING. COME ON.

1385
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:14,250
&gt;&gt; NOTHING OVER HERE.

1386
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:19,417
&gt;&gt; ( Bernice ): ALL CLEAR.

1387
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,959
&gt;&gt; OH, BOY.

1388
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:29,542
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

1389
01:14:29,709 --> 01:14:31,375
THERE'S THREE OF THEM!

1390
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:33,542
&gt;&gt; LET'S GET THOSE KIDS!

1391
01:14:33,709 --> 01:14:36,291
&gt;&gt; ( Annie ): JACK! BERNICE!

1392
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,208
LILLY!

1393
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:39,000
&gt;&gt; LADY, ARE YOU THEIR MOTHER?

1394
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:40,166
&gt;&gt; YES.

1395
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,375
&gt;&gt; THE CHILDREN THAT WANTED TO
SEE HOOVER?

1396
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:43,542
TWO GIRLS AND A BOY?

1397
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:44,709
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?

1398
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,375
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?

1399
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:48,875
&gt;&gt; INDEED I DO, MADAM.

1400
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:50,208
THEY'RE IN THERE.

1401
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,959
TRYIN' TO SAVE THEIR FATHER.

1402
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,625
&gt;&gt; ( Bernice ): WAIT HERE.

1403
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,834
LILLY!

1404
01:15:08,959 --> 01:15:12,792
&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK YOU
HAVE TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO

1405
01:15:12,959 --> 01:15:14,125
APPEARANCES.

1406
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,750
IT IS PERCEPTION THAT COUNTS
TODAY, AND IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO

1407
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:20,250
THINK POSITIVE, YOU HAVE TO GIVE
THEM SOMETHING TO THINK

1408
01:15:20,417 --> 01:15:21,750
POSITIVE ABOUT.

1409
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:26,834
&gt;&gt; BACK IN IOWA WHERE I WAS
BORN, THE GROUND WAS COVERED

1410
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,875
WITH SNOW BY NOVEMBER,
SOMETIMES OCTOBER.

1411
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:34,959
HERE, IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS, AND
THERE'S NOT A SIGN OF IT.

1412
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:44,166
&gt;&gt; THAT'S LOCKED.

1413
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,500
THERE.

1414
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,125
&gt;&gt; COME ON, THIS WAY!

1415
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:57,834
&gt;&gt; THEY GOTTA BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

1416
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,291
&gt;&gt; WHERE'D THEY GO?

1417
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:01,542
&gt;&gt; I'LL GO THIS WAY!

1418
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:10,166
&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT, THOSE REPORTS
SHOULD BE READY NOW.

1419
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:14,834
&gt;&gt; ( Jack ): LOOK!

1420
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000

WINDBAG HOOVER!

1422
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,333
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS HE?

1423
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,250
WHERE?

1424
01:16:20,417 --> 01:16:21,625
I NEED TO TALK TO PRESIDENT
HOOVER!

1425
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:24,208
&gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?!

1426
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:26,834
&gt;&gt; PLEASE! I NEED TO TALK TO
HIM! PLEASE!

1427
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:27,792
&gt;&gt; CORPORAL!

01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,333
SEE THESE CHILDREN OUT OF HERE!

1429
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,542
AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY GOT
IN HERE!

1430
01:16:31,709 --> 01:16:32,875
IF THEY COULD, ANYBODY COULD!

1431
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:33,834
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR!

1432
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,125
&gt;&gt; A MINUTE, THAT'S ALL I NEED!

1433
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,792
&gt;&gt; NO FUNNY BUSINESS NOW!

1434
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,917
I'M GOING TO MARCH YOU OUT OF
HERE, AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

1435
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,709
SAY A WORD, YOU GOT THAT?

1436
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:42,166
NOW LET'S GO--MARCH!

1437
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:47,542
&gt;&gt; I ALREADY TOLD YOU--
THEY DIDN'T GET IN.

1438
01:16:47,709 --> 01:16:48,667
&gt;&gt; AND I'M TELLING YOU THEY DID.

1439
01:16:48,834 --> 01:16:49,625
THIS MAN HELPED THEM.

1440
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:51,083
&gt;&gt; IT WAS ME.

1441
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,959
I SNUCK 'EM OVER THE WALL
WHEN THAT DELIVERY TRUCK CAME

1442
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:54,000
IN.

1443
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:55,667
&gt;&gt; NOBODY GETS PAST HERE ON MY
WATCH.

1444
01:16:55,834 --> 01:16:55,875
NOW STAND BACK, BOTH OF YA.

1445
01:16:56,834 --> 01:16:57,834
NOW STAND BACK, BOTH OF YA.

1446
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,083
&gt;&gt; I WON'T STAND BACK.

1447
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,125
I WANT MY CHILDREN,
NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY

1448
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:02,208
AND LET ME PAST!

1449
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:02,458
BERNICE! LILLY! JACK!

1450
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:05,000
BERNICE! LILLY! JACK!

1451
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,000
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

1452
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:08,959
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME HOW YOU
SNUCK IN HERE.

1453
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,083
&gt;&gt; NO, WE'RE NOT.

1454
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,458
&gt;&gt; ALL WE WANT TO DO IS TALK TO
THE PRESIDENT.

1455
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,291
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

1456
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,083
&gt;&gt; YOU KIDS ARE OUT OF HERE.

1457
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,500
&gt;&gt; HANG ON TO HIM!

1458
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:21,125
GO SEE HIM, BERNICE!

1459
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:22,083
&gt;&gt; HEY!

1460
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:25,375
THERE THEY ARE!

1461
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:26,583
THAT'S THEM!

1462
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,500
THAT'S MY CHILDREN!

1463
01:17:28,667 --> 01:17:30,333
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT!

1464
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,750
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, LET HER IN.

1465
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,917
&gt;&gt; KID, WILL YA--

01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:38,083
OH!

01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:38,792
&gt;&gt; MOMMY!

1469
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,834
&gt;&gt; OH, MY DARLINGS!

01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:46,667
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

1472
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:48,166
YOU REALLY ARE!

1473
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:49,375
OH, MY BABIES!

1474
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,542
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT A BABY.

1475
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:55,792
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LOOKING
AT YOU!

1476
01:17:55,959 --> 01:17:57,458
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?

1477
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:59,208
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT HOOVER?

01:17:59,375 --> 01:17:59,834

01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:09,834
TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY, BECAUSE
MY TEACHER MISS KNIGHT SAID YOU

1483
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,291
COULD DO WHATEVER YOU WANTED TO.

1484
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:12,834
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT.

1485
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,875
&gt;&gt; I DID A REPORT ON YOU IN

1490
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:28,917
DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW WHERE YOU
ARE?

1491
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:30,542
&gt;&gt; MY MOTHER'S AT HOME.

1492
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:34,458
I KNOW SHE MUST BE WORRIED,
BUT I HAD TO COME.

1493
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:37,709
I WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU UNLESS IT
WAS EXTREMEL Y IMPORTANT.

1494
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:39,208
MY FATHER'S IN JAIL.

1495
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:41,208
BUT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

1496
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,834
AND I NEED YOU GO GET HIM HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS.

1497
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:45,542
&gt;&gt; BERNICE!

1498
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:47,709
&gt;&gt; MOMMY!

1499
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:48,583
MOMMY?

1500
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,959
&gt;&gt; OH, BERNICE!

1501
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:51,959
OH!

1502
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:56,291
I CHASED AFTER YOU THE WHOLE
WAY.

1503
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:58,709
&gt;&gt; OH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

1504
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:04,291
&gt;&gt; IF ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED TO
YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD

1505
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:05,417
HAVE DONE.

1506
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:09,417
&gt;&gt; ( Hoover clears throat )
&gt;&gt; OH. MY.

1507
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:10,959
PRESIDENT HOOVER.

1508
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:15,917
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

1509
01:19:16,917 --> 01:19:19,083
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1510
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,875
&gt;&gt; NOTHING NEED BE SAID,
MRS. FEAGAN.

1511
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:26,250
LET ME WELCOME YOU TO
THE WHITE HOUSE.

1512
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,166
AND YOU TOO, BERNICE.

1513
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:34,458
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU ALL SIT DOWN
SO YOU CAN TELL ME THE WHOLE

1514
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:35,208
STORY.

1515
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:40,625
AND YOU MUST BE LILLY AND JACK.

1516
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:45,333
WHY DON'T YOU COME ALONG AND SIT
BESIDE YOUR MOTHER.

1517
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,834
&gt;&gt; ( crying )I'M SO SORRY.

1518
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,250
IT'S JUST SEEING THEM AGAIN.

1519
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,333
&gt;&gt; THAT'S QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE.

1520
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,458
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

1521
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:04,125
&gt;&gt; IF THIS COUNTRY PULLED
TOGETHER THE WAY YOUR CHILDREN

1522
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:07,458
OBVIOUSLY HAVE, WE'D ALL BE A
LOT BETTER OFF.

1523
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:16,667
I THINK THE BEGINNING WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE TO START.

1524
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:18,208
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

1525
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,250
&gt;&gt; ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE
BEEN MADE.

1526
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:26,125
A CAR WILL MEET YOU AT THE
STATION IN DETROIT AND TAKE YOU

1527
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:26,667
HOME.

1528
01:20:26,834 --> 01:20:28,083
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

1529
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:30,792
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR LETTING US
SLEEP OVER, MR. PRESIDENT.

1530
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,458
&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE, JACK.

1531
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:35,875
&gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH YOU WON'T GIVE
SOMEONE THE SKINNY PORK CHOP,

1532
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:37,834
YOU'RE STILL MY BEST FRIEND.

1533
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,500
&gt;&gt; WHAT? HA HA!

1534
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:41,834
WHY, THANK YOU, JACK.

1535
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,458
I'M VERY LUCKY TO HAVE A FRIEND
LIKE YOU.

1536
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:46,000
AND LIKE ALL OF YOU.

1537
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:49,625
I PROMISE TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR
YOUR FATHER.

1538
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:51,417
MEANWHILE, YOU MIND YOUR MOTHER

1539
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:54,625
AND DON'T BE TAKING ANY MORE
TRIPS LIKE THIS ONE.

1540
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:55,792
&gt;&gt; YES, SIR.

1541
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:57,083
&gt;&gt; OH!

1542
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,917
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

1543
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:01,125
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO, KIDS.

1544
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:03,542
THANK YOU, SIR.

1545
01:21:03,709 --> 01:21:05,333
&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE.

1546
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:19,000
&gt;&gt; I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT WHAT IF
HE'S GUILTY?

1547
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:24,208
&gt;&gt; WOW!

1548
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:36,750
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS?

1549
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:38,291
&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S NICE!

1550
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:42,875
&gt;&gt; DO YOU REALLY THINK PRESIDENT
HOOVER WILL GET DADDY OUT OF

1551
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:43,667
JAIL?

1552
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:44,959
&gt;&gt; HE SAID HE WOULD.

1553
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:47,500
&gt;&gt; HE SAID HE'D TRY.

1554
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:58,375
&gt;&gt; I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
JUST BARGED RIGHT IN ON HIM!

1555
01:21:58,542 --> 01:22:01,959
&gt;&gt; I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
AND I WAS THERE.

1556
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,417
&gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.

1557
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:07,041
WITH ANGUS COMING HOME,
THIS IS GONNA BE SOME CHRISTMAS.

1558
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:10,166
&gt;&gt; THIS IS GONNA BE SOME TREE.

1559
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:11,709
&gt;&gt; THE BEST WE'VE EVER HAD.

1560
01:22:11,875 --> 01:22:14,583
&gt;&gt; WE'LL WAIT AND LET DADDY PUT
THE STAR ON TOP.

1561
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,417
&gt;&gt; AND HE'LL PUT THE PRESENTS

1562
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:17,166
OUT.

1563
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,625
&gt;&gt; AM I GETTING A DOG?

1564
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:21,875
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GETTING OUR FATHER HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS.

1565
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:26,041
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, BUT ARE WE GETTING
ANY REAL PRESENTS?

1566
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:30,417
&gt;&gt; ( all laugh )
&gt;&gt; ( phone rings )

1567
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:33,709
&gt;&gt; HELLO.

1568
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:35,625
OH, MY GOD!

1569
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:39,125
IS IT YOU, MY DEAR ANGUS?

1570
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:41,625
&gt;&gt; IT'S ME, ANNIE.

1571
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,709
IT'S ME!

1572
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,166
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1573
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:47,208
&gt;&gt; YES, I'M FINE.

1574
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,333
I CAN'T TALK LONG.

1575
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,375
ANNIE, THE MAN WHO GOT HIT,
HE'S GOING TO BE FINE, HE'S

1576
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:56,667
GOING TO LIVE.

1577
01:22:56,834 --> 01:22:58,291
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS!

1578
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,792
WHEN ARE THEY LETTING YOU OUT?

1579
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:08,959
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY SAY I--
I MAY ONLY GET A YEAR.

1580
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:09,959
&gt;&gt; NO!

1581
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:12,709
I WON'T LET THEM, ANGUS.

1582
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:15,625
&gt;&gt; IT'S ONLY A YEAR, ANNIE.

1583
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:16,583
&gt;&gt; NO!

1584
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,291
&gt;&gt; IT'LL GO QUICKLY.

1585
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:21,291
TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

1586
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:22,500
&gt;&gt; ( guard ): TIME'S UP, FEAGAN!

1587
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:24,417
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOTTA GO.

1588
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,667
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I CAN.

1589
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,917
I LOVE YOU, ANNIE.

1590
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,583
&gt;&gt; ( crying ) NO....

1591
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:57,208
&gt;&gt; ( Jack ): WHEN'S HE COMING
HOME?

1592
01:23:57,375 --> 01:24:01,709
&gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
HOW VERY PROUD HE IS OF YOU.

1593
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:07,208
AND THAT HE'S FINE, AND HE
MISSES YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

1594
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:10,500
&gt;&gt; WILL HE BE HOME FOR
CHRISTMAS?

1595
01:24:10,667 --> 01:24:14,792
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE THING IS--
&gt;&gt; IS HE GONNA BE HOME FOR

1596
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:15,500
CHRISTMAS?

1597
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:21,083
&gt;&gt; NO. HE ISN'T.

1598
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,583
&gt;&gt; BUT HE HAS TO!

1599
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:28,667
&gt;&gt; HE THINKS THEY'LL MAKE HIM
STAY A YEAR.

1600
01:24:28,834 --> 01:24:30,166
&gt;&gt; A YEAR?!

1601
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:33,959
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT?

1602
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:37,917
&gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T CALL, BERNICE.

1603
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:41,792
&gt;&gt; HE HAD TO CALL!

1604
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:44,333
HE SAID SO!

1605
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,000
&gt;&gt; ( sobbing )

1606
01:24:59,709 --> 01:25:01,208
&gt;&gt; HE LIED!

1607
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:05,125
HE SAID HE'D HELP, BUT HE LIED!

1608
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:09,083
I THOUGHT HE COULD GET DADDY
HOME.

1609
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,625
I WANT US TO BE A FAMILY AGAIN.

1610
01:25:12,792 --> 01:25:17,542
HE HAS TO BE HERE,
SO WE DON'T GET PUT OUT ON THE

1611
01:25:17,709 --> 01:25:18,709
STREET!

1612
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:23,709
HE HAS TO BE HERE BECAUSE YOU
NEED HIM, BECAUSE YOU'RE

1613
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:24,792
PREGNANT.

1614
01:25:24,959 --> 01:25:27,792
&gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU KNOW I
WAS PREGNANT?

1615
01:25:27,959 --> 01:25:30,750
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW.

1616
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,291
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT A CHILD.

1617
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:35,291
WHY WON'T YOU SEE THAT?

1618
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:39,834
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE NOT.

1619
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,667
YOU'RE NOT ANYMORE.

1620
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:48,667
OH, MY DARLING DAUGHTER,
YOU'VE GOT THE WEIGHT OF THE

1621
01:25:48,834 --> 01:25:51,583
WORLD ON YOU.

1622
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,333
I'M SORRY.

1623
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,250
I'M SO SORRY.

1624
01:25:56,417 --> 01:26:02,000
WHAT YOU DID TOOK SUCH COURAGE.

1625
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:02,875
YOU TRIED.

1626
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:05,083
YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD.

1627
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,709
&gt;&gt; IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

1628
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:08,458
&gt;&gt; IT WAS ENOUGH.

1629
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:10,834
IT HAS TO BE WHEN YOU CAN'T DO
MORE.

1630
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,792
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

1631
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,083
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE?

1632
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,250
&gt;&gt; YES, I AM.

1633
01:26:17,417 --> 01:26:20,333
AND YOU SHOULD BE, TOO.

1634
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:24,500
YOU'RE SUCH A VERY SPECIAL GIRL.

1635
01:26:24,667 --> 01:26:27,709
&gt;&gt; I WANTED SO MUCH TO HELP HIM.

1636
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:29,542
&gt;&gt; SO DID I.

1637
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:32,083
AND I COULDN'T, EITHER.

1638
01:26:37,667 --> 01:26:40,166
&gt;&gt; OH, WE'RE A PAIR, AREN'T WE?

1639
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:42,500
THE TWO OF US CRYING LIKE THIS.

1640
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:44,333
YOUR FATHER WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

1641
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,333
YOU KNOW, HE'D WANT US TO BE
STRONG.

1642
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,375
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM?

1643
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:52,333
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

1644
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:56,000
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS, WE'LL STAY
A FAMILY.

1645
01:26:56,166 --> 01:27:03,166
AND WHATEVER HAS TO BE DONE,
YOU AND I, WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

1646
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:04,542
ALL RIGHT?

1647
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:08,417
&gt;&gt; ANNIE!

1648
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:10,333
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH.

1649
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,667
&gt;&gt; I THINK I'LL WAIT FOR
BERNICE.

1650
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:15,250
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE TWO
LITTLE ONES ON AND SAVE US A

1651
01:27:15,417 --> 01:27:16,083
COUPLE OF PLACES, ALL RIGHT?

1652
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:16,792
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, ANNIE.

1653
01:27:16,959 --> 01:27:18,458
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

1654
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:25,000
&gt;&gt; THEY'VE LEFT.

1655
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:26,166
WE'LL HAVE TO HURRY.

1656
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:28,500
&gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD I GO TO CHURCH?

1657
01:27:28,667 --> 01:27:30,208
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

1658
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:33,542
I PRAYED, MY FATHER'S STILL NOT
HERE.

1659
01:27:33,709 --> 01:27:37,375
I ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO HELP,
HE DIDN'T.

1660
01:27:37,542 --> 01:27:41,792
&gt;&gt; AND YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE IN

1661
01:27:41,959 --> 01:27:42,500
ANYTHING?

1662
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:50,917
BUT YOU'LL GO TO CHURCH TO MAKE
YOUR MOTHER HAPPY.

1663
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:59,250
YOU FOUND YOUR FAITH WHEN YOU
NEEDED IT.

1664
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:02,917
IT'S WHAT GOT YOU TO WASHINGTON.

1665
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,667
YOU'LL FIND IT AGAIN.
