(Multicom Jingle)

00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:17,187
(horn blowing)

3
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:23,278
(piano music)
(chattering)

4
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:50,160
(car doors banging)

5
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,363
- Oh, hello sunshine.

6
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,730
- Bradley.

7
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,303
- Mr. Townsend asked
that we pay you a visit.

8
00:00:57,248 --> 00:00:58,443
- No.

9
00:00:58,443 --> 00:00:59,888
No.

10
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:02,388
(crying out)

11
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:10,873
- That's enough, you sadistic bastard.

12
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:12,706
Go and get the camera.

13
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:20,605
(gun firing)

14
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:28,794
(shutter clicking)

15
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:31,344
That's another one for Mr.
Townsend collection, eh?

16
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,933
Stay.

17
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:40,821
(upbeat rock music)

18
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,750
- David, when it comes to deals,

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,810
always remember where
the finance comes from,

20
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,213
including your own.

21
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:10,154
Got the passports?

22
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,580
We should be landing soon.

23
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,413
- Good.

24
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,563
- Hmm, interesting.

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,060
- Actually, he's one of the photographers

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,260
that we were discussing.

27
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,441
- Out of the window now.

28
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,440
Other way.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,930
That's perfect, that's good.

30
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,250
Now with your tongue out, lick your lips.

31
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,500
Lick you lips, that's it.

32
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:40,470
Come on, put some more sex into it.

33
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,851
Come on, you're supposed
to be a Victorian hooker.

34
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:44,132
- Oh.

35
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:44,965
(shutter clicking)

36
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:45,798
- Alright, that's one for me.

37
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,662
Now about the shoots for Vogue huh?

38
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:51,412
(dramatic music)

39
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:26,142
- [Woman] Coffee?

40
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:26,975
- Mmhmm.

41
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,100
Like the stuff?

42
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,700
- Smashing.

43
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,240
I think she's smiling too
much in this one though.

44
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,850
By the way we had an interesting
phone call this morning.

45
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,172
- I hope it was obscene.

46
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:44,170
- No, it was from the
office of Howard Townsend.

47
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,670
You know, the shipping tycoon.

48
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,733
- What does he want?

49
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,490
Snaps of his latest super tanker?

50
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,370
- He wanted to discuss an assignment.

51
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,100
He's left a number here
for me to ring him back

52
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,560
and arrange a time.

53
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,831
- Might be interesting.

54
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:57,040
- Let's ring him now and fix it.

55
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,370
- Oh give me a minute.

56
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,320
- No, now.

57
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,565
(phone whirring)

58
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:06,315
(dramatic music)

59
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,193
- My name's James Compton,
Mr. Townsend's expecting me.

60
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,780
- Yes sir, would you
drive straight through,

61
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,003
park your car and someone will
meet you at the front door.

62
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,699
- Jesus.

63
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,532
(engine rumbling)

64
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:47,807
(dramatic music)

65
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,570
- Mr. Compton do come in.

66
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,403
- Thank you.

67
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,619
(dramatic music)

68
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,147
(door bangs)

69
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,920
(clicking)

70
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,970
- One moment sir.

71
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,566
I shall inform Mr. Townsend's
secretary that you are here.

72
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,816
(clicking)

73
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:45,853
Mr. Compton is here.

74
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:48,103
(clicking)

75
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:56,394
Shan't be long sir, please take a seat.

76
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:58,644
(clicking)

77
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:04,840
(dramatic music)

78
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,050
- [Howard] Jacob if that
shipment is not in Beirut

79
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,680
by next Thursday I'll personally
hand you over to the--

80
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,656
- Mr. Compton?

81
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:11,489
- Mmhmm.

82
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:13,314
- This way please, Mr.
Townsend will see you now.

83
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:18,314
(clicking)
(dramatic music)

84
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,470
- [Howard] Mr. Compton it's my pleasure.

85
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,310
- Pleased to meet you.

86
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,009
- I've been looking forward
to meeting you for some time.

87
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,997
Sit down, drink?

88
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:31,040
- Ah, no thanks, to early for me.

89
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,052
- [Howard] Would you mind if I do?

90
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:33,931
- Not at all.

91
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:36,160
- You know photography
is an interest of mine,

92
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,240
I've been following
it's rise as an art form

93
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,193
for many years now.

94
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,610
Recently I saw your latest book.

95
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,730
I must say I was, I was very impressed.

96
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,563
- Thank you.

97
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:47,960
- You have a special talent

98
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,963
for photographing beautiful women.

99
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,573
Which brings me to why I asked you here.

100
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,470
- Yes, I was intrigued.

101
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,940
- I have a special friend named Simone,

102
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,950
I want some photos of her
like the ones in your book.

103
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,250
Actually I checked with
a number of photographers

104
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,170
but your work has impressed me the most,

105
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,780
it your individuality I suppose.

106
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,053
Are you interested?

107
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,390
- Could be.

108
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,140
I'll have to see the subject first.

109
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:18,604
- Of course.

110
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:26,278
Simone, will you come in here please?

111
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:29,730
I don't think you'll be disappointed.

112
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,290
I know that you're very expensive

113
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,110
but fortunately I'm a wealthy man.

114
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,100
I'll pay double your normal rates,

115
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,627
just send an invoice when you're through.

116
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:38,260
(door clicks)

117
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,093
Ah, Simone.

118
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,310
I want you to meet James Compton.

119
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,770
He's gonna take some photographs of you,

120
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,563
or at least we hope he will.

121
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,850
- How do you do Mr. Compton?

122
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,470
- Hello.

123
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,453
I've seen photos of you before, somewhere.

124
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,140
- You've got a good memory.

125
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,060
I did do some modeling, sometime ago

126
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,300
but I didn't stay at it long.

127
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,133
- [James] You shoulda.

128
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,223
You've got nice presence.

129
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:08,940
- Well, maybe I could start
doing some housewife ads.

130
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,290
- Ah you can't be that old.

131
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:13,053
- (scoffs) You'd be surprised.

132
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,990
- Alright Simone that'll be enough.

133
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,823
You can go now.

134
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:20,653
- My, that was quick.

135
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,270
Goodbye Mr. Compton.

136
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,103
- Goodbye.

137
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,309
(clicking)

138
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,450
- This Beirut deal has
really gone to his head.

139
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,420
Now he's talking about wanting

140
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,483
to finance a revolution in Africa.

141
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,690
- Yeah, he's had that idea for years.

142
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,840
Just the thought of it
makes him feel good.

143
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,280
- Well, I'm on to something
that just might bring him

144
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,940
back down to earth.

145
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,350
I have to check a few things first

146
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,300
but I just may possibly have something.

147
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,702
Ever hear of a photographer
called James Compton?

148
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,610
(dramatic chord)

149
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,130
- Well my dear, Mr. Compton
has agreed to photograph you.

150
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,800
I suggest you make your own arrangements

151
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,093
regarding appointments.

152
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,739
- Well do I go to his
studio or does he come here?

153
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:15,700
- Well not here, you know I don't allow

154
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,560
other people on these premises.

155
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,890
No, make arrangements
to use Compton's studio.

156
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,550
Charles will take you and
pick you up afterwards.

157
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,600
- As you wish Howard.

158
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,350
- I've always admired beauty

159
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,650
and envied those who can
capture it in some way.

160
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,460
All Mr. Compton has to do is to capture

161
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
what already exists.

162
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,680
(phone ringing)

163
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,513
Hello.

164
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,183
Hold on a moment.

165
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:44,370
Why don't you call Compton's studio,

166
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,370
make arrangements for the first session?

167
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:55,963
What is it?

168
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,890
How do they know?

169
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,770
Now listen only three people
knew that we were selling

170
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,770
to both sides yourself, myself and...

171
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,373
David, that double crossing bastard.

172
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,893
I'll handle it.

173
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:15,597
(phone clatters)

174
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:18,073
Get me an outside line.

175
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,490
(clattering)

176
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:25,722
(dramatic music)

177
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,834
(door bell ringing)

178
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:01,540
- Hello, you must be Miss--

179
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,010
- Simone.

180
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,810
- I'm Rhoda James's secretary.

181
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,643
Come on in.

182
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:09,535
- Oh thank you Charles,
I'll see you at seven.

183
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:10,440
- Thank you.

184
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,273
- This way.

185
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,200
Excuse the mess, we've
been working overtime.

186
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,430
Well here's the master.

187
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,170
- Hello.

188
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,003
How are you?

189
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,960
- Fine but a bit nervous.

190
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,600
- [James] Ah you'll be alright.

191
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,500
- Excuse me James I'll just
go and get those prints.

192
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,333
- [James] Fine.

193
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,068
Here let me take your bag.

194
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:36,808
- Oh, thank you.

195
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:39,180
- Well, make yourself at home.

196
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,280
Coffee?

197
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,113
- Oh yes please.

198
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:41,946
- Milk and sugar?

199
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:42,781
- Milk and no sugar.

200
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,364
(gentle music)

201
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,983
Thank you.

202
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,030
Does that really sail?

203
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,143
- Yes every Sunday.

204
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,690
Right, now I'm gonna go slow today

205
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,670
and give you time to warm
up in front of the camera

206
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,836
and give me a chance to see
you in a variety of costumes.

207
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:27,030
- Yes I am feeling a bit tense.

208
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,443
It seems ages since I've
done this sort of thing.

209
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,900
- Alright, take your time,

210
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,733
I'll be ready when you are.

211
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:36,687
- Oh thank you.

212
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,309
(dramatic music)

213
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,363
- Okay, here we go.

214
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,150
Right, sit up a bit, that's it, that's it.

215
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,669
Turn to your left.

216
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:22,652
Um, good.

217
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:24,410
(camera clicking)

218
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,577
Right, fingers through your hair.

219
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,764
- Like this?

220
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:29,742
- Mmhmm.

221
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:30,575
(camera clicking)

222
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,060
You mentioned that you modeled before.

223
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,130
- Oh yes I did but when
I was very much younger.

224
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,480
- [James] Tell me about it.

225
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,340
- Well, my father died when I was 17

226
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,610
and the family split up
and I had to get a job.

227
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,360
Modeling seemed the obvious answer.

228
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,260
It was quite fun at first,

229
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,090
all the bright lights and everything

230
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,760
and then it became quite unpleasant.

231
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,850
I started having awful rows with my agent

232
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,183
about the pettiest things.

233
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:56,884
- [James] Oh it's not always like that.

234
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:59,620
- No I know it's not but it
seemed like it at the time.

235
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,830
Anyway my photographs were
turning up in the strangest

236
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,770
places in obscure magazines in America

237
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,930
and all over the place

238
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,980
and I wasn't being paid for them

239
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,493
so, well I decided to get out.

240
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,516
- Okay no more chatter,
now turn to your right.

241
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:17,666
That's it, let's have
a profile, chin down.

242
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:19,779
(camera clicking)

243
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:20,953
Good, now onto me.

244
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:23,170
(camera clicking)

245
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,770
Fine that's enough sophistication
let's have a smile now.

246
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,770
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, that's it.

247
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:33,987
(camera clicking)

248
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,737
(dramatic music)

249
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:50,060
- Well I'm packing my things now.

250
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,952
Look--

251
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:51,785
(thuds)

252
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:52,618
Just a minute.

253
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,443
That's okay.

254
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,841
I tell you the plans perfect.

255
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,150
Now we really have him by the balls.

256
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,990
Look um, I'll meet you at eight o'clock

257
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,223
and we can discuss it in detail okay?

258
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:15,270
- [Man] Mind the roads won't you sunshine?

259
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,729
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.

260
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:19,605
(laughs)
(suspenseful music)

261
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:21,382
(crying out)

262
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:26,049
(whacking)
(crying out)

263
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,900
(screaming)
(dramatic music)

264
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:51,524
(ominous chord)

265
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:57,738
- Well I like this one,
this one with the umbrella

266
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,124
and this one I think.

267
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:00,463
- Oh I think I look silly in that.

268
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:03,810
- No I think it's got something
even if you don't think so.

269
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,670
Anyway I've got some ideas
how we can develop these

270
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,560
into something for another time.

271
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,520
- And talking of time, what time is it?

272
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,763
- Ah, 6:45.

273
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,950
- I've gotta go.

274
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,820
- Can I give you a lift?

275
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,060
- No thank you, it's not allowed.

276
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,060
It's the house rules that
the chauffeur takes me back.

277
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,880
- Okay but on Wednesday
we go to the south coast

278
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,740
in my car okay?

279
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,137
I want some shots by the ocean.

280
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:24,970
- Alright.

281
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:28,832
(dramatic music)

282
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,470
- Oh, not bad for an amateur.

283
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,930
- She's quite good.

284
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,960
She has a certain quality
of hidden vulnerability

285
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,310
that photographs very well.

286
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,797
- What's she doing with
someone like Townsend?

287
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:55,630
(camera clicking)

288
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,463
- That's a good one.

289
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,026
That's it, take it easy, relax.

290
00:20:59,026 --> 00:20:59,859
(camera clicking)

291
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,692
That's it.

292
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,830
(camera clicking)

293
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,663
Good one.

294
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,400
That's it, that's perfect.

295
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,906
That's a good one.

296
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:10,739
(camera clicking)

297
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:11,943
Okay, relax a bit now.

298
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,263
- I'm sorry I just feel so awkward.

299
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,790
It's all those people up
there, they bother me.

300
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,260
- [James] One of the
hazards of the profession.

301
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,950
- I just feel so self conscious.

302
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,470
- Okay, let's go further up there

303
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,243
possibly we'll find some seclusion there.

304
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:33,210
(gentle music)

305
00:22:50,422 --> 00:22:55,422
(chattering)
(dramatic music)

306
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,865
- You used to work in New York didn't you?

307
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:55,698
- That's right.

308
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:56,843
- Well what made you stay in London?

309
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:59,710
- Oh I guess I was in love
with the Queen or something.

310
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,050
No it's just that the states was getting

311
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,210
just to commercial.

312
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,420
- So you're around to capitalism?

313
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,290
- Oh no not at all.

314
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,311
After all I'm an independent
business man myself.

315
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:11,303
It's just that there, there are limits.

316
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,330
And you, how did you get
mixed up with Townsend?

317
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,297
Doesn't seem your type.

318
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:21,010
- Oh, well I first met
Howard about three years ago.

319
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,280
It was on a flight to the Middle East

320
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,540
he was a passenger and
I was the air hostess.

321
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,866
- Ah love at first sight.

322
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,283
- No, not at all.

323
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:31,560
We started going out and
one thing led to another.

324
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,393
- And?

325
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:34,220
- [Simone] And we now have a
very convenient relationship.

326
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,954
It was a contract really.

327
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:36,890
- Oh.

328
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,560
- Well look I'm his girlfriend alright?

329
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,940
His mistress.

330
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,990
I have been for three years

331
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,840
and I've been very well

332
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,213
and he's not too demanding.

333
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,990
I mean, when it's all over
as it inevitably will be

334
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,990
I should be financially stable for life.

335
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,497
We're very happy like that,

336
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:54,420
I'm mean, I'm not his first mistress

337
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,430
and I'd be silly to think
I'm going to be his last.

338
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,250
- Aside from collecting beautiful women

339
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,600
what else does Townsend do?

340
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:04,123
- I don't know really,
it's none of my concern.

341
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,120
- Oh it seems a bit suspect if you ask me.

342
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,600
- Well look, a man in his
position can't be completely

343
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,913
clean you know that.

344
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,590
Anyway Howard has tremendous style,

345
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,940
that's what I like about him.

346
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,540
So I just try and ignore
the other side of his life.

347
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,342
- [James] Good thinking.

348
00:25:22,342 --> 00:25:24,592
(clicking)

349
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:26,391
- Hi.

350
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,224
- Hi.

351
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,750
- How are things going with Miss Simone?

352
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,950
- Oh she's okay.

353
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,387
- I bet.

354
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:32,630
(phone ringing)

355
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,440
Compton Studios good morning.

356
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,010
- Rhoda my dear how are you?

357
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,160
- Oh hello Mr. Patterson
I'm fine thank you.

358
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,910
We haven't seen you for a long time.

359
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,010
- Been up to me eyes
in it lately old girl.

360
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,500
Is the dear boy around?

361
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,910
- Yes he is, hold on a
minute I'll just get him.

362
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,860
It's Ian Patterson.

363
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,220
- Ian how are ya?

364
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,150
And where you been hiding?

365
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,930
- I'm in great form dear boy.

366
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,750
Been charging around the
country putting together

367
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,087
this collection of mine.

368
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,200
- [James] How's it going?

369
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,230
- Well pretty well on the whole I think

370
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,760
which is why I'm calling you.

371
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,870
How's your diary?

372
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,770
Got any free time
reasonably soon old chap?

373
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,910
- Well I could always fit you in.

374
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,134
What have you in mind?

375
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,400
- Well I'm not quite sure
to tell you the truth.

376
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,770
I rather want to get some photos

377
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,143
of this collection of mine.

378
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,080
The way I see it is a set
of simple shots of each one

379
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,870
plus a shot showing them all together.

380
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,973
That's if you agree of course.

381
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:24,760
- Well your choice.

382
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,500
I'd like to take them out
under the trees I think.

383
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,140
- Anything you say.

384
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,121
How about placing some young
thing as an eye catcher?

385
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:32,860
- Oh you dirty old man.

386
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,700
Well it might liven them up a bit.

387
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,216
Give the picture some balance.

388
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:37,330
- [Ian] Balance.

389
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,450
- Yes, depth, color,
composition, that sort of thing.

390
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,920
Anyway that's my worry, it
needn't be your problem.

391
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,980
- Thank God for that.

392
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,030
Never could get to grips
with you artistic chaps

393
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,200
nothing concrete to get
hold of, all in the mind.

394
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,347
- That's nice, who lives there?

395
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:52,410
- It used to belong to my mechanic.

396
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,440
He was with me for years.

397
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,500
Pity, he departed this life last year.

398
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,950
I use it as a spare room now.

399
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,680
- Funny world dear boy, I'd
never had dreamed 20 years ago

400
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,830
that this line of work
would be so profitable.

401
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,570
Why I've made more in five
years of private practice

402
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,610
than my entire 25 years
with Scotland yard.

403
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,310
- But surly you miss your old mates hm?

404
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,490
- Oh they've all left or retired,

405
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,440
most have got cushy jobs
with large companies.

406
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,790
In fact one of my formal
colleagues is instrumental

407
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,743
in my securing a very
lucrative contract with CBM.

408
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,320
- Another lager for me and me mate.

409
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,070
So you're still in computer espionage hm?

410
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,170
- I most certainly am.

411
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:40,960
In my profession dear boy,

412
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,293
computer espionage is
the trend of the future.

413
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,850
- Okay, that's it, oh nice profile.

414
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,447
That's a girl.

415
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,740
Fine.

416
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,925
Well that's enough on that car.

417
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,592
(gentle music)

418
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,561
Okay well let's go in here,

419
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:04,679
now I want you to lie
back on the upholstery,

420
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,287
that's it, let's pretend it's 1936

421
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,100
and we're selling model T Fords

422
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,267
to the discriminating english gentry.

423
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:13,674
Excellent.

424
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:16,507
(dramatic music)

425
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:13,450
- They're nice I'm impressed.

426
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,033
- Thank you.

427
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:16,750
- It must be fun being a photographer,

428
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,450
meeting all different sorts of women.

429
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,070
- Oh it's not what you think.

430
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,180
- No?

431
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,960
- Well I suppose I'm
attracted to my models,

432
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,490
otherwise I wouldn't get good pictures.

433
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,850
If you get between them and the camera

434
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,750
sometimes the pictures suffer as a result.

435
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,583
- I see, oops.

436
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:34,560
(dramatic music)

437
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:35,583
(water rushing)

438
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:57,044
(eerie music)
(water running)

439
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:16,888
(birds chirping)

440
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,570
- [Howard] Hello.

441
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,217
- Hello, I didn't see you there.

442
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:29,040
- [Howard] Would you like a drink?

443
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,130
- No thank you.

444
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,360
- Anything wrong?

445
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,940
Got something on your mind?

446
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,840
- Wrong?

447
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,587
No what ever gave you that idea?

448
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,560
- Well you haven't been
yourself these past few days,

449
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,190
I thought perhaps
something was worrying you.

450
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,990
- No, nothing at all.

451
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,233
Yes I think I will have that drink.

452
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,500
- [Howard] Any problems
with the photographer?

453
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,623
- No it's going fine.

454
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,603
Look I'm sorry if I'm a bit
off, I don't mean to be.

455
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,620
- I'll tell you what,

456
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,220
let's go shopping, we haven't
done that for a long time.

457
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,000
I am celebrating a
successful business deal

458
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,707
and new clothes will put
the sparkle back into you.

459
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,917
- What a lovely idea, thank you.

460
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,498
(whimpering)

461
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:24,581
(suspenseful music)

462
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,427
- Well gentlemen I believe we
all understand one another,

463
00:33:45,427 --> 00:33:48,680
and know the basic reasons
for our being here tonight.

464
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,100
Mr. Mehet has been kind enough
to bring a short reel of film

465
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,907
with him for us to see, Mr. Mehet?

466
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:56,600
(film clicking)

467
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,190
- Gentlemen, this is the Essex 80 tank

468
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,180
manufactured by a
certain communist country

469
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,462
friendly to my government.

470
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:09,860
200 of these tanks have recently
been supplied to my country

471
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,150
and I must admit that we are most pleased

472
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,968
by their performance.

473
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:19,635
(film clicking)

474
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,850
- And gentle men it seems
that for a certain price

475
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,340
Mr. Mehet's government could
actually afford to lose

476
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,620
a dozen of these tanks
without much difficulty

477
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,023
or write them off as
having been lost in combat.

478
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,190
And I just happen to know
the commander in chief

479
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,870
of a black revolutionary army in Africa

480
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:47,150
who would be most happy to
purchase these lost tanks

481
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,300
for a price that will produce

482
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,720
a tidy little profit for
all parties involved.

483
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,350
Of course for political
reasons Mr. Mehet's government

484
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,940
can't deal directly with
the revolutionaries,

485
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,140
that's where we come in.

486
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,383
Well gentlemen, are we interested?

487
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,540
- Christ, last year we buy
wheat from the Americans

488
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,100
and sell it to the Russians,

489
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,930
this year we're buying
tanks from the Arabs

490
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,800
and selling them to the Africans.

491
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,460
My God what's this world coming too?

492
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,093
Yes of course I'm interested.

493
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,200
- I also am interested but
what about the details?

494
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,560
Such as what are the prices involved?

495
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,410
How are the goods to be shipped?

496
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,463
And most important, how are
the payments to be made?

497
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:31,281
(dramatic music)

498
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,120
- Well how'd it go?

499
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,510
- So so, disappointing at
first but it'll work out.

500
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,453
- Oh that's good.

501
00:35:45,171 --> 00:35:46,071
- And how are you?

502
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:50,680
- I'm fine but Howard I've got a headache.

503
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,513
- How untimely.

504
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:54,470
- Yes I know I'm sorry but
I'm just not in the mood.

505
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,930
- You haven't been in the mood all week.

506
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,200
Have you already forgotten this afternoon?

507
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,880
- Ouch, will you please be gentle with me?

508
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,570
(cries out)

509
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,590
Just because you've had a
bloody bad business meeting

510
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,060
doesn't mean you can take it out on me.

511
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,989
- You bitch.

512
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:08,341
(smacks)
(cries out)

513
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:13,174
(crying)
(dramatic music)

514
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:18,357
(squeaking)

515
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,143
- [James] That's enough.

516
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:24,547
- Oh it's lovely.

517
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,450
Can you pass me a rag?

518
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,790
Thank you, I have to go to a reception

519
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,270
and I mustn't look stodgy.

520
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,103
- Do you have to leave soon?

521
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:37,406
- Oh no, those things go on all night.

522
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:42,406
(chatting)
(gentle music)

523
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,307
- Well gentlemen I certainly
thank you for your visit

524
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:55,800
and wish you a pleasant journey home.

525
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,010
And no doubt I shall
hear from your embassy

526
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,060
about your decisions.

527
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,423
- Right, last one.

528
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
- Didn't you ever have an assistant?

529
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,720
- I usually hire photography students

530
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,813
but the last one just
went back to collage.

531
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,170
Why do you want the job?

532
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:15,792
- Hm, it's a thought.

533
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,483
- Excuse me.

534
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,790
Ed, I've got a job for you.

535
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,030
No there's no need to
meet now, just listen.

536
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,650
Simone has gone to Crompton's place.

537
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,893
I want you to go there.

538
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,480
- Right Mr. Townsend, we're on our way.

539
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,033
- James?

540
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,540
Howard's been acting very strange lately.

541
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,880
- You mean he suspects?

542
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,640
- Oh yes I'm certain of it.

543
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,670
And besides us there's been
some other strange goings on.

544
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,270
- Such as?

545
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,130
- Well first off all last
week Howard's business manager

546
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,323
committed suicide for no apparent reason.

547
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,580
And then he had a meeting
where he was showing a film

548
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,188
of tanks and guns and I don't know what.

549
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:04,938
(dramatic music)

550
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:32,170
(bangs)
(gasps)

551
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,623
- Stay put sunshine, don't
move, keep perfectly still.

552
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:39,984
- For Christ sake, what's all this about?

553
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,500
(whacks)

554
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,620
- You weren't listening were you sunshine?

555
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,900
Just be a good boy and
do what you're told.

556
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,900
- You, go get your gear and make it quick.

557
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,680
- [James] Who the hell are you?

558
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,800
What do you want?

559
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,879
- [Man] Alright sunshine, all
in good time, you'll find out.

560
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:59,796
(fingers snapping)

561
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:07,150
- [James] What you gonna do with her?

562
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,050
- She's coming with us, you're
going in another direction.

563
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,060
Keep her in there eh?

564
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,160
I'm gonna have a word with sunny Jim here.

565
00:39:19,744 --> 00:39:22,561
Now that's a bird with real form hey?

566
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,387
A shame to spoil it it, wouldn't it?

567
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:27,130
Now you listen carefully
cause I'm gonna explain

568
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,880
something to you and I do
hate having to repeat myself.

569
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,403
I want you to take this letter
and give it to Mr. Townsend.

570
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,080
Tell him that the lady with the form

571
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,793
has fallen into the wrong hands.

572
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,850
- You mean you're not from Townsend?

573
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,160
- Right.

574
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,470
Now you just do what you're
told, give him the letter,

575
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,490
tell him to read it carefully,

576
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,890
he will quickly get the message.

577
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,040
- He'll probably go
straight to the police.

578
00:39:54,537 --> 00:39:56,537
- No he won't do that, no if I know him.

579
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,710
He'll pay a great deal of
attention to the envelope

580
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,660
he might, he just might,
be more than a little upset

581
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,720
with you but the police never,

582
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,670
not if he wants to see her alive again.

583
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,040
- And what if he thinks
I'm involved with you?

584
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,380
- Well that's your problem isn't it?

585
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:19,120
If he finds out about this
little bit of beddy bies

586
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,040
we're going to have to find
ourselves a new messenger boy.

587
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,570
Mr. Townsend can be very
unpleasant when he's upset.

588
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,513
Believe me I know.

589
00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:30,590
- Look, I don't know
what's going on between you

590
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,930
and Townsend but if you lay
a finger on her I'll get you.

591
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,543
- I'll bare that in mind sunshine.

592
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:40,390
(door bangs)

593
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,490
This should keep you occupied for a while.

594
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,130
Nothings gonna happen to
the lady for the time being.

595
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,630
You'll be hearing from us
as to what happens next.

596
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:52,667
Mind the road sunshine.

597
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,602
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.

598
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:58,352
(dramatic chord)

599
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:02,260
(engine rumbling)

600
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:08,624
- [Ed] That'S his studio there.

601
00:41:08,624 --> 00:41:11,624
(suspenseful music)

602
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:32,906
(engine rumbling)

603
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,980
(crickets chirping)

604
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,239
- [James] I'll wait here for you.

605
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,239
(dramatic music)
(chattering)

606
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:03,730
- Now then Compton what
the hell's this all about?

607
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,450
- Look Mr. Townsend I'm a
photographer, not a clairvoyant.

608
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,130
All I know these heavies
come, they lay into me,

609
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,290
they take Simone and then they tell me

610
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,220
to give you this note.

611
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,340
- When did this happen?

612
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,030
- About an hour ago when we were working.

613
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,440
- You expect me to believe that?

614
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,100
You wouldn't be trying
to hustle me would you?

615
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,140
Most unwise Crompton, most unwise.

616
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,290
- Look I know it's incredible
but it's a fact, look.

617
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,520
- Did you notice anything about them?

618
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,630
- No it all happened so fast.

619
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,631
One was a big guy, bald
head, cockney accent.

620
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:33,893
- Well, well, so that's it.

621
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,500
200,000 well it's a nice round figure,

622
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,100
I suppose they will have
to be told that I will pay.

623
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,883
- Thank God for that.

624
00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:43,100
- Oh don't misunderstand me Mr. Crompton,

625
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,310
what I say and what I do are
two entirely different things.

626
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,340
- [James] I can't believe it,
it's like a bloody nightmare.

627
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,300
- [Harold] Well consider yourself lucky,

628
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,250
nightmares are things you wake up from.

629
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,950
First I want proof that Simone is alright.

630
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,380
A note from her plus a photograph.

631
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,230
Then tell them I'll be ready to deal.

632
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,590
If you have ever felt danger before,

633
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,680
remember it and feel it now.

634
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,180
I guarantee you have never
stood so close to oblivion.

635
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,460
If anything happens to Simone as a result

636
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,980
of anything you do wrong
there is not place anywhere

637
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,583
and I mean anywhere that
you can hide from me.

638
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,430
That is a promise.

639
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:23,430
(suspenseful music)
(engine rumbling)

640
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:29,369
(suspenseful music)

641
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,770
- This is where you'll stay.

642
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:00,050
There's magazines here and
there's a loo down the corridor.

643
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,280
Now there'll be someone
outside all the time

644
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,973
so don't try anything funny.

645
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:06,140
(thuds)

646
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,533
Oh yes the ah, the windows are bolted.

647
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,640
So have a good holiday eh?

648
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:28,790
- [Man] And I want someone
on Crompton from now on

649
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,603
24 hours a day.

650
00:44:30,603 --> 00:44:33,186
(upbeat music)

651
00:44:56,338 --> 00:44:59,005
(phone ringing)

652
00:45:00,561 --> 00:45:01,626
- Hello?

653
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:02,671
- [Man] Crompton?

654
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:03,530
- Yeah, yeah I'm here alone.

655
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,580
- [Man] What did Townsend say?

656
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,070
- Well besides being madder than hell,

657
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,850
he says he'll pay the cash

658
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,120
but first he wants some
proof that she's alright.

659
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,580
He wants a note in her hand
writing and some photographs.

660
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,355
- [Man] Alright we'll get them to you.

661
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:18,860
And with the instructions and
what to do with the money.

662
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,838
You'll be hearing from us.

663
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:22,921
(buzzes)

664
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:31,040
(door bangs)

665
00:45:36,946 --> 00:45:37,779
- For you.

666
00:45:49,626 --> 00:45:52,043
(door thuds)

667
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:04,560
(knocks)

668
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,393
- Yes?

669
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,330
- I'm just off down to the shops.

670
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,120
Do you want something?

671
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:17,007
- Oh, yes thank you, just a
minute I'll make you a list.

672
00:46:27,506 --> 00:46:30,256
(phone whirring)

673
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,533
- [Rhoda] Hello?

674
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:35,770
- Rhoda, it's James,

675
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,750
now look something important has happened.

676
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,180
Now I can't really tell you about it now

677
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,720
but we've got to cancel all appointments

678
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,794
for the rest of the week.

679
00:46:41,794 --> 00:46:42,723
- [Rhoda] What, you don't mean it?

680
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:44,073
- Yeah I'm afraid I do.

681
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,420
Tell every one I've got flu

682
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,760
and reschedule them for next week.

683
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,950
- [Rhoda] You're joking.

684
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,010
- Oh I wish I were, no this is for real.

685
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,310
Now I want you to phone
form your place and...

686
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:32,422
(dramatic chord)

687
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,140
- Hey you know I've been thinking.

688
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:36,973
- Yeah?

689
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:43,393
- We both worked for that
bastard Townsend for seven years?

690
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:48,203
Always doing the dirty work
while he jets around in style.

691
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,804
- So what else is new?

692
00:47:51,804 --> 00:47:55,370
- Well, we are getting
a nice chunk of his cash

693
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:59,800
as our just rewards but
there might be something else

694
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,110
we can do as revenge for our exploitation.

695
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:04,963
- Such as?

696
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,778
- Well, that is his mistress in there.

697
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:11,050
(ominous music)

698
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,563
All lonely and helpless and...

699
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,975
You know what I mean.

700
00:48:18,975 --> 00:48:23,975
- Yeah I know what you mean.

701
00:48:25,865 --> 00:48:26,943
(ominous music)

702
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:28,093
- What do you want?

703
00:48:29,928 --> 00:48:34,203
- Oh tell us a few things about Townsend,

704
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,373
like what's he like in bed?

705
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:42,411
What about yourself?

706
00:48:42,411 --> 00:48:46,990
I ah, bet your quite a
hot piece of crumpet.

707
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,928
Hey now, what's the matter baby?

708
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:57,555
(whacks)
(crying out)

709
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:10,100
(thudding)
(crying out)

710
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:10,933
- Come on.

711
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:15,087
Shut up.

712
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:20,087
(crying out)
(dramatic music)

713
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:28,394
Shut up you bitch.

714
00:49:28,394 --> 00:49:29,403
(crying out)

715
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:31,187
Could make it a lot easier on yourself

716
00:49:31,187 --> 00:49:32,263
if you don't resist.

717
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:38,347
(dramatic music)
(screaming)

718
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:44,570
(thuds)

719
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:45,403
- You bastards!

720
00:49:47,181 --> 00:49:49,186
Get the hell out of here!

721
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,536
This is not part of the
arrangement understand?

722
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:56,850
I'm sorry lady.

723
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,417
It won't happen again.

724
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,103
Get out!

725
00:50:04,821 --> 00:50:07,571
(dramatic chord)

726
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:20,976
(dramatic chord)

727
00:50:26,882 --> 00:50:29,799
(camera clicking)

728
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,460
- That's six, that should
be enough, shouldn't it?

729
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,560
- Yeah that's alright.

730
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:39,870
- Here, who's gonna
develop these pictures?

731
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,797
You don't trust them to Kodak do you?

732
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:45,530
- Who do you think Crompton
is genius, a plumber?

733
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:48,080
We'll send the film to him,
tell him to develop it.

734
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:52,287
Here's a pen, write a note to Mr. Townsend

735
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,052
and tell him you're okay.

736
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:54,885
(phone ringing)

737
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,718
- Here!

738
00:50:55,718 --> 00:50:56,551
What was that?

739
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:57,384
- Shut up.

740
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:01,785
(suspenseful music)

741
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,180
- [Man] Yes?

742
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,490
- [Man] Hello, Bishop's coal delivery.

743
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,820
Checking to see if you need anything

744
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,740
while I'm in the neighborhood.

745
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,630
Been a bit nippy this winter hasn't it?

746
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,290
- [Man] No we're okay.

747
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,213
We've got all the coal we need for now.

748
00:51:19,213 --> 00:51:20,810
- [Man] All right, here's me card,

749
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:21,960
give us a call if you need more.

750
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,710
- [Man] Right will do, now goodbye.

751
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,443
- [Man] Goodbye.

752
00:51:25,443 --> 00:51:28,488
(door thuds)

753
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:30,186
(camera snaps)

754
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:33,186
(suspenseful music)

755
00:51:51,882 --> 00:51:53,720
- Do you think he was legit?

756
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,663
- I dunno, he looks okay.

757
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,509
But just the same, we
better stay on our toes.

758
00:51:58,509 --> 00:51:59,742
- Yeah.

759
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:02,575
(engine rumbling)

760
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:09,338
(phone ringing)

761
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,770
- Hello?

762
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:21,803
- Hello sunshine.

763
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,200
Listen sunshine, in the
dust bin behind your place

764
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,400
you're gonna find a package.

765
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,980
Now in that package is
instruction on how to deliver

766
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,610
the money, there's a note from the lady

767
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,113
and there's a roll of film.

768
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,867
Now I want you to develop that film

769
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,423
and take the whole lot to Townsend.

770
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:46,590
(clicks)
(buzzes)

771
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:02,717
(suspenseful music)

772
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,440
- So you see how I got
myself into this position.

773
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,530
You're the only person I can trust.

774
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,220
- Steady on old chap.

775
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,720
Let's deal with one thing at a time,

776
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,320
you just relax for a moment
while I fix you a drink.

777
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,090
- I know I'm being tailed
but I don't know by whom.

778
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,970
Could be Townsend or the other heavies.

779
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,500
I suspect my phone's been tapped.

780
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,763
Christ knows what else.

781
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,070
Really it's not my scene at all.

782
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,290
- Try this.

783
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,100
Now let's take a look
at this license number

784
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,770
and see where that leads us.

785
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,360
- Can you trace the owner?

786
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,580
- Well that poses no
problem, come dear boy

787
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,760
let's take a look at how the
other half makes a living.

788
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,360
Might take your mind off things.

789
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:54,743
You see we use this and this.

790
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,090
It's like this dear boy,
hundreds of computers

791
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,650
in this country keep different files

792
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,610
on everything from Scotland
Yards most wanted criminals

793
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:06,263
to a list of people who subscribed punch.

794
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,400
Most of these computers are
accessed by computer terminals

795
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,130
which are then joined by
ordinary telephone lines.

796
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,690
Each terminal has it's own code

797
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:17,760
and each computer has
it's own phone number.

798
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,850
This black book contains
the telephone numbers

799
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,513
of most of the top secret
computers in this country.

800
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,970
- How did you acquire the black book?

801
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:29,440
- Well my dear boy, 25
years at Scotland Yard

802
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,193
has some compensations.

803
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,760
Actually licensed investigations
are the most common,

804
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,970
the computer files are kept for

805
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,940
the central processes in the Home Office.

806
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,675
I've just set the code and we
dial the computer like this.

807
00:54:41,675 --> 00:54:44,425
(phone whirring)

808
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,190
Now what was that number again?

809
00:55:00,822 --> 00:55:03,370
(clicking)

810
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,287
(electric beeping)

811
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,903
Mr. Harry Mosley eh?

812
00:55:14,903 --> 00:55:17,430
I'll have one of my men check him out,

813
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,000
if he's not involved at least
he should be able to lead us

814
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,163
to the house, let's meet here tomorrow.

815
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:29,341
(dramatic chord)

816
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:33,881
(suspenseful music)

817
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,930
- They want the money on Thursday night.

818
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,420
They're only giving us 30 minutes notice

819
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,840
as to where we'll meet.

820
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,673
- Bastards.

821
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:44,303
That gives me just two days.

822
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,170
Okay I'll have the cash
by Thursday afternoon.

823
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
- And another thing.

824
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,540
Would you mind telling me what
the hell this is all about?

825
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,386
- I'm still not convinced that
you're not involved Crompton.

826
00:56:02,386 --> 00:56:03,920
But just let's just say
the nature of my business

827
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,740
causes some people to
bear grudges against me.

828
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,180
Now if those people are
also politically orientated

829
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,380
then one has to be very
sure of ones footing

830
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,783
before making reprisals.

831
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:18,335
(knocking)

832
00:56:22,861 --> 00:56:23,694
- You up?

833
00:56:24,642 --> 00:56:25,975
Everything okay?

834
00:56:30,031 --> 00:56:34,202
60 hours from now you
are gonna be a free bird.

835
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:35,673
At least from us you will be.

836
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,380
- You don't really think
you're gonna get away

837
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,230
with this do you?

838
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,050
You must be joking,

839
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,450
between Howard's men and the police

840
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,460
you don't stand a chance.

841
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,293
- The police?

842
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:48,361
(chuckles)

843
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:51,180
Lady you don't know your
Mr. Townsend very well.

844
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,840
He is up to his neck in so much

845
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,483
that there is no way he is
going to go to the police.

846
00:56:58,876 --> 00:57:00,993
Here, I'm gonna show you something.

847
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,883
Alright, this is last weeks evening paper.

848
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,673
I collect these.

849
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,460
Now who do you think originated the idea

850
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,447
of David Green taking a leap, hm?

851
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,270
I could also list 10 other people

852
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,270
who owe their fate to your Mr. Townsend.

853
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,650
And I can guarantee you
that there is not a chance

854
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:32,750
of it happening to me.

855
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,240
However, if I were a
gambling man and I am not,

856
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,700
but if I were I would
bet that the next name

857
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,850
on Mr. Townsend's obituary list

858
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,153
would be that of Mr. James Compton.

859
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:50,541
(dramatic chord)

860
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:53,374
(engine rumbling)

861
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:09,607
(suspenseful music)
(engine rumbling)

862
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,410
- We found the house,
it's in Hertfordshire.

863
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:46,470
- Should we go there?

864
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,920
- Yes, but first I want
you to hear something.

865
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,223
Some recordings I've made.

866
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,347
This should amuse you.

867
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:01,470
- Hello, hello Mr. Townsend it's Ed.

868
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:03,220
We've follow Crompton back to his studio

869
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,555
he's there now, came
directly from your place.

870
00:59:06,555 --> 00:59:08,916
However before he went to you he visited

871
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:11,247
a strange looking place in Soho,

872
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,065
looked like a betting office.

873
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:14,015
- [Ian] Betting office?

874
00:59:14,015 --> 00:59:15,182
What nonsense.

875
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,690
- [Crompton] Nice guy
I've got us involved with.

876
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,410
- From what we've been able
to observe the girl is held in

877
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,473
an upstairs room and three men
stay in the house with her.

878
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,120
- Suppose we made some
sort of a diversion,

879
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,840
something that would momentarily
move them away from her?

880
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,970
And if we could get away with her

881
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,210
without being seen ourselves

882
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,740
all the evidence would point
to Townsend wouldn't it?

883
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,893
- That would put the
cat among the pigeons.

884
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,240
- Especially if they saw our car

885
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,320
which just happened to be a Rover 2000.

886
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:56,918
(knocking)

887
00:59:56,918 --> 00:59:58,170
- Shirley.

888
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,076
- Yes sir?

889
00:59:59,076 --> 01:00:00,930
- Put on a mini skirt and heavy makeup,

890
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,734
we've got a special assignment for you.

891
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:03,571
- Okay.

892
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:05,321
- That's a good girl.

893
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,690
Rover 2000 did you say?

894
01:00:10,536 --> 01:00:13,119
(upbeat music)

895
01:01:24,016 --> 01:01:25,489
Now it's our turn.

896
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:28,322
(dramatic music)

897
01:03:03,452 --> 01:03:08,452
(dramatic music)
(engine rumbling)

898
01:03:09,196 --> 01:03:11,946
(dramatic music)

899
01:03:37,992 --> 01:03:40,825
(engine rumbling)

900
01:03:45,028 --> 01:03:47,861
(dramatic music)

901
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:51,665
- Bastard.

902
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:54,498
(dramatic music)

903
01:03:57,557 --> 01:03:59,470
- You sure you want to
go through with this?

904
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,190
We could just let Townsend pay the ransom.

905
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,190
- Christ I'd rather she
stayed with the kidnappers

906
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:05,290
than went back to him.

907
01:04:15,712 --> 01:04:17,213
- I'm pretty sure it
wouldn't go over there.

908
01:04:17,213 --> 01:04:19,522
- Alright, don't fucking tell me.

909
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,689
(snoring)

910
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:29,374
(engine rumbling)

911
01:04:41,049 --> 01:04:42,216
- Here we are.

912
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:55,917
- That's it.

913
01:04:56,863 --> 01:04:58,430
- What time is blast off?

914
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,193
- How about one a.m. alright?

915
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,333
- Yeah, okay.

916
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,320
Well let's get going.

917
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,153
- Just a second.

918
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,840
You almost forgot something.

919
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,273
- [James] Is this necessary?

920
01:05:12,273 --> 01:05:15,890
- I think so, and remember
James, no fancy heroics.

921
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:19,000
I'm still not convinced
the lady's worth it.

922
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:25,579
(suspenseful music)

923
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,845
(thuds)
- Stick.

924
01:07:24,845 --> 01:07:27,845
(suspenseful music)

925
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,660
(booms)

926
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:48,266
(window shatters)

927
01:07:48,266 --> 01:07:49,266
- Oh my God.

928
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:52,522
- Come on.

929
01:07:52,522 --> 01:07:55,040
(fire crackling)

930
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,775
- [Man] Come on, move.

931
01:07:56,775 --> 01:07:57,608
The girl!

932
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:02,822
(cries out)

933
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:05,655
- [James] Ah that's it, that's it.

934
01:08:09,274 --> 01:08:11,191
- Go, I'll follow them.

935
01:08:12,449 --> 01:08:13,282
- [James] This way.

936
01:08:13,282 --> 01:08:18,282
(dramatic music)
(fire crackling)

937
01:08:40,436 --> 01:08:45,436
(guns firing)
(dramatic music)

938
01:09:55,618 --> 01:09:56,911
(cries out)

939
01:09:56,911 --> 01:09:57,744
Go!

940
01:09:57,744 --> 01:10:00,577
(engine rumbling)

941
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,667
(gun firing)

942
01:10:12,135 --> 01:10:12,968
- Shit.

943
01:10:15,855 --> 01:10:20,203
Hey that was one of
Townsend's cars, wasn't it?

944
01:10:20,203 --> 01:10:22,187
- And then one night I
over heard them talking.

945
01:10:22,187 --> 01:10:23,350
They all used to work for Howard,

946
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,619
that's how they knew his operation.

947
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:27,505
- You mean there's no
political connection?

948
01:10:27,505 --> 01:10:28,338
- Political?

949
01:10:28,338 --> 01:10:30,938
No, they're just ordinary
gangsters after the money.

950
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:35,273
Hey where are we going?

951
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,823
- Well we can't go to my
place, it's being watched.

952
01:10:40,773 --> 01:10:43,356
(gentle music)

953
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:11,910
We could stay here for a few days,

954
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:14,600
take it easy, decide what we're gonna do.

955
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,040
- I wish I had a needle and thread.

956
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,993
- Oh I'll get supplies
when the shops open.

957
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,490
- James I can't stay here.

958
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:24,323
- [James] Hm?

959
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:25,381
- It wouldn't work.

960
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,893
- [James] What won't work?

961
01:11:26,893 --> 01:11:29,187
- Look I'm scared, if
Howard finds out about us

962
01:11:29,187 --> 01:11:30,787
I don't know what he's gonna do.

963
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,710
I've got to go today.

964
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,480
- You're kidding, you
wouldn't go back to him now,

965
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,780
not after what's happened.

966
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,840
- Look I don't know, I
don't know anything anymore,

967
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,190
all I know is that I must go today

968
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:44,780
and it's for your safety as well.

969
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,410
- [James] Bullshit.

970
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:48,170
- Look try and understand,

971
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:51,130
I got us into this mess and
I know I can get us out.

972
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:52,570
- That's bullshit and you know it.

973
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:54,003
- It's not and you know it.

974
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:58,110
Please be patient.

975
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,560
Staying with you now is
not gonna solve anything.

976
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,060
It'll all work out.

977
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,193
- Oh Christ.

978
01:12:08,005 --> 01:12:13,005
- I'll phone you.

979
01:12:14,126 --> 01:12:16,959
(engine rumbling)

980
01:12:25,563 --> 01:12:28,396
(dramatic music)

981
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,114
- You'll have to stop at the gates.

982
01:14:10,114 --> 01:14:12,947
(engine rumbling)

983
01:14:18,468 --> 01:14:20,059
That's odd.

984
01:14:20,059 --> 01:14:21,642
He's usually there.

985
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,151
Oh, do drive on.

986
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,984
(engine rumbling)

987
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:58,969
(ominous chord)

988
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:01,469
(eerie music)

989
01:15:18,563 --> 01:15:21,563
(suspenseful music)

990
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:45,482
(screams)

991
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:57,993
- Thank God.

992
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,763
- What happened?

993
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:05,093
- They came here, Bradley.

994
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,737
Phone an ambulance.

995
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:17,421
(eerie music)

996
01:16:28,936 --> 01:16:31,686
(phone whirring)

997
01:16:37,805 --> 01:16:40,388
(eerie music)

998
01:16:45,788 --> 01:16:46,621
- [Howard Voiceover] You bitch.

999
01:16:46,621 --> 01:16:48,116
(smacks)

1000
01:16:48,116 --> 01:16:50,441
(eerie music)

1001
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:55,358
(gun fires)
(eerie music)

1002
01:16:57,919 --> 01:17:00,752
(dramatic music)

1003
01:18:03,086 --> 01:18:06,003
(Multicom Jingle)
