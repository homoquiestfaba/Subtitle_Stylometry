1
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,051
Is it popping yet?

2
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,280
Yeah!
- All right.

3
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,118
By the way, I got a line on that
apartment I told you about.

4
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,421
It's beautiful, man. You
should check it out.

5
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,896
Where is it at?
- On Ninth Street, between B and C.

6
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,058
Carlos, can I see you a minute?

7
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,370
I've been going
over your drawings.

8
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,568
What do you think?
- Good.

9
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,611
They remind me a little
of Tommy Cashman.

10
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,477
Tommy Cashman? Holy fuck. That
dude draws some slick shit.

11
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,413
How long have you been
working on these?

12
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,577
About a year. Can you show these
to your friend at Gotham Comics?

13
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:44,419
I can... but I'm not going to.

14
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,788
But you just said they were good.

15
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,089
So is 'The Hulk,' but I
don't have to like it.

16
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,062
Your drawings are
technically fine,

17
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,930
but it just shows that you can copy
well, and they've got no soul.

18
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,629
I've known you for two years,

19
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,231
we've had a hundred
conversations... about comics.

20
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,639
You are a passionate
dude with deep ideas,

21
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,077
so I'm looking at this and thinking,
'Is this all you've got to say?'

22
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,583
Aliens from Jupiter want to
enslave the women of the Earth?

23
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,321
Yep!

24
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,178
You dumb motherfucker.

25
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,912
Cans go in the blue,
green is for paper.

26
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:53,218
What's going on?
- I ain't touching those hands.

27
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,786
How did it go this morning?

28
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,923
David totally dug my shit, man.

29
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,832
He might send something
over to Gotham Comics.

30
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,961
That's excellent.

31
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:09,064
Check it out. It's the
Brunswick Monster.

32
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,134
How much did you pay for that?
- What does it matter?

33
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,146
I predict this ball is gonna
add 15 points to my game.

34
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,192
Now all I got to do
is get to Vegas.

35
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,528
Vegas?

36
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,591
The Amateur World Classic is next
month, it costs 3,000 to enter,

37
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,570
but get this... the purse
is a hundred grand.

38
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,437
I don't know,
Mick... three grand?

39
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,537
Gracias, mi amor.

40
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,549
Hey, mi amor!

41
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,021
When you're finished playing with
the kids, come play with me.

42
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,321
Where is the car?

43
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,224
I got a guy tuning
her up in Yonkers.

44
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,990
Going out to the
track next weekend.

45
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,226
I'm ready for Le Mans.

46
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,758
You ready to come with
me? Take a chance?

47
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,035
I can't leave the kid by himself.
- Excuses, excuses.

48
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,702
You're just fooling around
with that register.

49
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,406
I have to pay you back, right?
- That's right.

50
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,059
Good morning!

51
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,099
The light, Mag. I'm
trying to finish this.

52
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:59,103
Good morning to you, too.
- Hey, hey, muñeca.

53
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,469
Buen día.

54
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,985
What is it with
these space chicks

55
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,489
and the hugest tetas I've
ever seen in my life?

56
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,650
What happened to the eggs?

57
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,422
The eggs I asked you to bring
home last night? Those eggs?

58
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:27,398
I guess they're at the bodega.
- I guess so.

59
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,697
Why don't we go out for breakfast?
We haven't done that in a month.

60
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,364
I've got to work.
- I thought you were hungry.

61
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,432
I am, but-- hey, why
don't you get the eggs?

62
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,740
I've got to pick up
beads for the dress.

63
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,905
You can't do me a favor?

64
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,608
I got that part for
your sewing machine.

65
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,776
So? You said you were
gonna do that for a month.

66
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,877
And then, you finally did
it. Ha ha. Big favor.

67
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,413
See you later.
- Hey, Mag, wait.

68
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,052
Maggie, wait. I don't want you
to leave like this, all angry.

69
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,029
I'm not angry, I just want
to know what's up with you.

70
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,191
It's just that I...

71
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,428
I don't know what I'm
doing with my drawings.

72
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,266
David said some shit,
yesterday... you know what, babe?

73
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,240
You know what? I'll
get the eggs, okay?

74
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,333
Okay?
- Really?

75
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,742
Yeah.

76
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,338
I'll scramble them real
nice, like you like them...

77
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,145
with spinach in
them... mm-mmm.

78
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,277
Okay?
- Okay.

79
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,414
I'll even get the beads.

80
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,470
Benny Moré?

81
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,511
Sí.

82
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,641
No hay problema.

83
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,999
Viejo, you know she ain't
gonna pay you, right?

84
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,560
What do you care? I mean
she's been coming in here

85
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,936
for 12 years.

86
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,841
If you divide 98 by 12,

87
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,403
it makes $8 a year
for her loyalty.

88
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,282
Then throw in Señora Rodríguez,
Señora Salcedo, Señora García...

89
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:37,186
Son, we have to have the
sense of the community.

90
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,588
That's very important.

91
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,786
Tito understands that, right?
- Claro.

92
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,353
Tito understands everything.

93
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,097
You're a day late!

94
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,003
Hey, Miss Mercedes.
Miss Mercedes!

95
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,941
I need you at the other building.

96
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,607
Can I clean up first?
- Later.

97
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,185
What's the fucking rush?

98
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,348
I told you we have to get these
windows in by the end of the month.

99
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,983
Why are these cans in
with the newspapers?

100
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,220
Didn't we have this
conversation before?

101
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,695
I posted notices on every floor.
- That's not enough.

102
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,495
At the end of the day, you're
responsible, not the tenant.

103
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,614
My man! What's
happening?

104
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,784
Maggie, my buddy Mickey.
- What's up?

105
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,987
Mickey... and Daisy.
- Fuck you...!

106
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,223
Daisy, what's happening?

107
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,562
This is Berna. She
draws comics, too.

108
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,965
Hi, it's called
'Little Coffin Annie.'

109
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,402
It's Victorian
necrophilia pornography.

110
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,235
I've got to go to the girls' room.
- I'll come with you.

111
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,176
Where do we go?
- Negotiating hostages in there?

112
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,612
Fuck it. I ain't waiting
in this line, come on.

113
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,014
We have to wait.
- I ain't waiting. I've got to pee.

114
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,951
You're not gonna pee in the sink?
- No?

115
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,319
Oh, God. You're so crazy.
- I've got to pee.

116
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,586
That's what Mickey says.

117
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,767
You know, people are
fucking weird here, okay?

118
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,009
Did I tell you I got
a callback at Gotham?

119
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,569
That's great!
- They're interested in my strip.

120
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,944
That's good for you, man.

121
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:48,213
He's got this comic where this guy
gets shrunk to the size of an atom.

122
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,552
It's a quark, man.

123
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,819
It's a quark. A
subatomic particle.

124
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,125
How's your thing going? You
were gonna show it to David.

125
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,392
Oh... he likes it a lot.

126
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,299
Yeah?
- What's it about?

127
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,032
I'm kind of reworking it.
- It's fucking awesome.

128
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,540
Mickey! You haven't
seen it yet, dude.

129
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,940
You told me about it.

130
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,174
Did you check out that
apartment I told you about?

131
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:19,115
Yeah man, it's the shit. Maggie,
you got to see this place,

132
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,812
it's a railroad flat on
Ninth Street and Avenue C.

133
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,082
Ninth Street?
- Yeah, baby, it's great.

134
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,283
I'm not moving down there.

135
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,927
It's already rented out.
- I don't care if it's rented out.

136
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,124
I felt like a little
pendejita sitting there.

137
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,033
I asked Danny 'cause it was an
idea, and he looked into it.

138
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,128
You even went to go see it.

139
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,038
It was beautiful, a gorgeous
place with a lot of sunlight.

140
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,542
I felt like I could breathe
for once in my life.

141
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,375
Really? Well, maybe you should
go breathe by yourself.

142
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,608
I can't be without
you. Don't you get it?

143
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,243
No, I don't, because you
don't talk to me anymore.

144
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,982
I don't know what you're doing.
- I was thinking about both of us.

145
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,581
You sewing in the back and
me drawing in the front,

146
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,820
like we dreamed. Like
we talked about.

147
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,023
We've been here
our whole lives.

148
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,330
Our whole fucking lives.

149
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,719
Okay, good night.
- Good night.

150
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,801
Show me the safe.

151
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,180
I take the money every afternoon...
- Show me the safe or I'll shoot.

152
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,345
I don't have a safe.
- Show me the safe!

153
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,717
Don't shoot me, because it's
gonna be worse for you.

154
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,283
Show me the fucking safe!
- The rest of your fucking life...

155
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,857
See here?

156
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,231
The bullet shattered your
father's vertebrae right there.

157
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,362
It severed the spinal
cord. And my guess...

158
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,067
is that the gun was
fired at close range.

159
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,633
He's lucky to be alive.
- So...?

160
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:04,580
He'll never walk again. He's
paralyzed from the waist down.

161
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,392
Viejo?

162
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,765
Viejo?

163
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:34,074
Soy yo. Soy
yo, Carlos.

164
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,742
When you're working
in a bodega,

165
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,256
there's this unwritten rule that
when some crazy motherfucker

166
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,315
walks into the store to rob you,
you treat him like he's king,

167
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:25,295
like he has God-given permission
to own that fucking bodega.

168
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,231
You chill and you smile and
you hand him the money,

169
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,292
then you throw in a pack of Camels,
for the road, on the house.

170
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,669
What are you saying?
- I'll bet you that the old man...

171
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,968
talked trash with the
asshole who shot him.

172
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,739
Baby, that guy was a nutcase!
- He never saw the safe, babe.

173
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,871
Okay.

174
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,610
The police said the
safe was locked.

175
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,778
The old man held out
on the fucking guy.

176
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,414
As plain as day.

177
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,755
Carlos, you want
another helping?

178
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,061
Carlos?

179
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,095
Carlos?

180
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,142
You want more ham?
- Oh no, I'm fine. Thank you.

181
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,083
See you in a couple of days.

182
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,993
Mickey, wait.

183
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,227
Carlos, there's someone I
want you to see. Let's go.

184
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,166
Come on, help
me clean up.

185
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,434
Six months ago he came to
me and asked for a loan,

186
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,842
to stay afloat.

187
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,971
He shouldn't have been
in that position.

188
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,846
I shouldn't have
given it to him.

189
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,613
The thing is, this
is not a small loan,

190
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,656
25 grand.

191
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,658
Yeah.

192
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,922
Come on.

193
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,868
There's a bodega on every
corner of the Heights, Carlos.

194
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,029
What makes Eddie's profitable?

195
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,198
Eddie!

196
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,438
Why is Eddie in
debt? Eddie.

197
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,845
If he sells the place,
I get my money back,

198
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:01,215
and I'm not forced to
have this conversation.

199
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,811
We both know he
ain't gonna sell it.

200
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:08,258
We both know he ain't gonna be able
to work it for quite some time...

201
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,591
if ever!

202
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,187
The way I see out of
this, for all of us...

203
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,234
is you take over.

204
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,738
The bodega, it's
a cash cow.

205
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,502
You're his kin.

206
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,305
People would keep coming in,

207
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,870
'cause they associate
you with your old man.

208
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:58,074
Maybe you should hang
with las viejas on 190th.

209
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,271
Why are you looking
at me like that?

210
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,816
Doctor says you're
getting out of here soon.

211
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,857
They set you up with a daytime
nurse for a couple of months.

212
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,984
I spoke to the insurance lady.

213
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,029
I put a little extra in to get
you through the next few weeks.

214
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,533
Gracias.
- You've got a real gift, Carlos.

215
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,936
Don't let go of that.

216
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,736
Put me down, carajo!
- I got you.

217
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,006
Put me down, coño!
- I got you.

218
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,323
Nice! Let's get
some light in here.

219
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,600
Better, right?

220
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:07,761
You have some nice plants here,
Mr. Eddie. Let me knot it for you.

221
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,036
They could use some water.

222
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,905
Let's take this jug.

223
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,750
Turn it, dude. You're
gonna break the window.

224
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,916
Stop fucking bitching.
- What did I tell you?

225
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,756
You'll hit the walls.
- Shit. It's fucking heavy.

226
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,558
Why don't you leave it here?
You'll be back in two weeks.

227
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,997
Don't you dare, I'll
beat your ass up.

228
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:42,468
All right, Mr. Eddie...
I will see you mañana.

229
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,237
Yes? Around 7:00?

230
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,505
You forgot the Yankees
cup at the hospital,

231
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,513
so bring it back, tomorrow.

232
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,607
I forgot your Yankees cup?
- Yes, you did. Bring it tomorrow.

233
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,653
All right, you two have
a good night. Take care.

234
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,814
See you later.
- I like her.

235
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,674
Carlos?

236
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,217
Carlos!

237
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,399
What's up?

238
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,897
I shit myself.
- What?

239
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:26,971
I said, I shit myself.

240
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,273
Throw that shit
away. He ain't dead.

241
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,680
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey kids, kids!

242
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,694
Kids, take it outside
with the water.

243
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,459
Take it outside with
the water! Hello?

244
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:31,263
Go. Hey, take it
outside with the water.

245
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,808
'Regular.'
- Okay, 'Regular.'

246
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,580
Ay, no. Dame
'Lights.'

247
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,679
'Lights.'

248
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,885
You still need 30¢.

249
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,228
I'll pay you back.
- Ah, señora, sorry.

250
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,393
No more loans.
- But Eddie said...

251
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,599
Forget Eddie, doña. No
money. No loans. Entiende?

252
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,373
Have a good day!

253
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,687
Why don't you clean up
the back or something?

254
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,385
Okay, 'Boss'!

255
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,358
Ay, coño!

256
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,896
She's crazy!
- Let's take him back up, guys.

257
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,135
You see, she's
speaking in tongues!

258
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,009
Cuidado, coño! Cuidado,
carajo! Let's go!

259
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,548
Anybody listening to me?
- Let's go. To the left.

260
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,016
That's it. Yeah!

261
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,179
You did a good job on
the building, son.

262
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,348
You know the tournament?

263
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,552
You know the bowling
tournament in Vegas?

264
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,289
Not that again.

265
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,059
It's an investment.

266
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,330
No. It's not an investment,
it's a $5,000 vacation.

267
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:16,237
It's for the tournament.
It costs 3,000 to enter,

268
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,935
I've got to have some
money to fly out there...

269
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,604
for food and a hotel.

270
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,512
It's not like on five Gs I'm
gonna be able to get fancy.

271
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:28,143
You know, this bowling
thing of yours...

272
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,710
it's making you
look like a sucker.

273
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:34,849
What kills me is... there's no one
even trying to talk you into it.

274
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,486
It's just you.

275
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,799
Excuse me, excuse me.

276
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,597
Look, here. Somebody take your
boy... take your son and gone.

277
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,796
Take your father and him gone.
- What?!

278
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:51,330
What happened?
- Some boys took your father...

279
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,969
and I don't know
where he went.

280
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,843
Coño! Tito, take care of the
register, I'll be right back.

281
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,383
It's not my fault. I
don't know where he is.

282
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,942
'Santa María, Madre de Dios...

283
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:32,847
ruega por nosotros,
pecadores...'

284
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,159
You're funny.

285
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:46,588
I swear you think about Mom more
now than when she was alive.

286
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,626
She understands.

287
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,566
That's what you're looking
for? Understanding?

288
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,233
Tell it to someone else,
'cause she ain't listening.

289
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,943
She is listening,
believe me.

290
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,779
She's listening.

291
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,916
Mamá...

292
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,985
Eddie is still fucking every
woman he can get his hands on,

293
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,826
except now, he has given
them all his money too.

294
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,728
You used to sing
that song to Mamá.

295
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,059
Carlos, put me to bed.

296
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,510
I think it looks cute.
- Red...

297
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,646
red, red...
- Looks kind of cute, right?

298
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,190
I think so.
- Oh my God!

299
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,749
There!
- You look like an angel.

300
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,091
That looks pretty good, right?
- Yeah.

301
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,428
As long as I don't eat a piece of
food for a month, I'll be fine.

302
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,798
Yeah, I thought you said
you wore a size six.

303
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,599
She was a size six. Like
12 years ago, right?

304
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:44,437
Hey... yo, that ain't funny. Shit.
- I'm sorry.

305
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,840
Don't be like that. You
know you look gorgeous.

306
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,972
You do, you're beautiful.

307
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,949
Hey, Carlos.
- Hi, baby!

308
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,257
I said, uh!

309
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,560
The bitch is four feet tall. And
her man is supposed to have...

310
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,968
Here you go.
- ...a 10-inch dick!

311
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,097
Baby?

312
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,302
You're sure?
- No.

313
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,214
Do you want some
of this, Carlos?

314
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,842
No. I'm not into that shit.

315
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,510
What are you into?

316
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,682
Are you sure?

317
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:37,524
I'm out of here.
- Carlos? Where are you going?

318
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,756
Out.
- But...

319
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,732
Carlos, wait!
What's up with you?

320
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,203
I'll catch you
tomorrow, all right?

321
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,937
If you told me a month ago

322
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,449
I'd be running my pop's bodega,
I'd say you were smoking crack.

323
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,041
If you had told me when
we were in high school

324
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,178
that I'd be the super
of our building...

325
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,691
I'd told you that you were having
some kind of psychotic episode.

326
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,785
That shit is not even funny, man.

327
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,626
And you know what
the thing of it is?

328
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,723
What?
- I'm a pretty good super.

329
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,962
Don't take this the wrong way,
but it ain't that hard, man.

330
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,631
It can be hard,
you dumb fuck!

331
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,834
You've got to have all sorts of
different management skills,

332
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,072
you've got to know how to deal with
all sorts of different people,

333
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:05,809
you got to know your
accounting, and I recycle.

334
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,250
Don't forget:
'Always recycle.'

335
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,051
'Blue goes with cans.
Green goes with paper.'

336
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,525
Don't mix it with the fucking
plastic. Don't forget.

337
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,654
Oh, shit!
- My ball!

338
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,893
Come here.
- Oh, thank you.

339
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,027
Oh, you stupid fucker!

340
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,133
On weekends,

341
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,007
me and Daisy got this thing,
where she calls me...

342
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,171
to fix stuff in her apartment,

343
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,842
and I go up, and
we have sex.

344
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,442
I mean, if her mother's
not home, you know?

345
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:48,288
But, who else gets paid to fuck?
- Ho's.

346
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,838
People, watch my shit.

347
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,686
Everybody on the floor!

348
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,485
Hey, bruja!

349
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,018
You better not be drinking
out of the bottle,

350
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,155
you know how
Carlos hates that.

351
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,825
Carlos? That
nigga ain't here.

352
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,902
Which one of your hooker
friends is this one for?

353
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,169
You should let me know, so I
could roll up and fuck her.

354
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:42,235
Sometimes I wonder how we come
from the same two people.

355
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,874
Get the fuck outta here. We both
got a talent for merchandising.

356
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,783
Merchandising? Is that what
you're calling it? Merchandising?

357
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,117
Why don't you let a
nigga set you up?

358
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,588
Set you up with a little shop.
We can keep all your shit there.

359
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,626
Because I can take care of all
my shit right here in my house.

360
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,754
It's all right, hermanita.

361
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,355
One day, I'm gonna
open you up a store,

362
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,560
when you come back
with me to the D.R.,

363
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,865
en la Calle del Sol,

364
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,235
we could call it 'Maggie's.'

365
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,070
Yeah? Give it to Darlene.

366
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,805
Are you trippin'?

367
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,347
You know Carlos ain't gonna
take care of your ass.

368
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,747
Like everybody else in
this motherfucker...

369
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,445
out for himself.

370
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,421
You know what, hermanito?

371
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:30,119
Why don't you support your
kids... y déjame de joder?

372
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:34,062
I was looking out for
my little sister.

373
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,365
This place is starting
to look like a dump.

374
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,241
Why don't you take some boxes away?
- Okay, boss.

375
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:50,474
Don't call me that.

376
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,482
Where do you guys
get this from?

377
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,580
It's beautiful.

378
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,852
You know that can of paint
up front, the white one?

379
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,393
Yes.

380
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,929
Why don't you go get it
and paint over that shit?

381
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,364
Everybody gonna like this.

382
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:13,301
It gives some cultural
stuff to the store

383
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,134
and the kids love that.

384
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:23,335
I drew that.
Eight years ago.

385
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,473
My mom used to watch
me every afternoon.

386
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,211
Altogether, it took
about... a month.

387
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,789
Why you want to
take it down?

388
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:37,021
'Cause it's bullshit.
- It's beautiful.

389
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,654
You said your mom liked
it, I'm sure your dad...

390
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,960
Why don't you cover that shit?

391
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,159
You put a part of yourself
into the store...

392
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,533
What are you...?

393
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,663
I did that shit for my father,

394
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,368
he covered that shit and
now you want to uncover it?

395
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,640
When I come back, this
shit better be gone.

396
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,848
Stop!

397
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:36,047
Yo! Ten cuidado, coño.
- Watch where you're going.

398
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,670
Right, right. Okay.

399
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,373
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, chau.

400
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,745
Hey.
- Hey.

401
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,716
What's up, Carlos?

402
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,311
He's coming along.
- Yeah?

403
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,583
Yeah.

404
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,698
Oye, those are selling fantastic, bro'!

405
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,067
Good.
- You want it?

406
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:31,301
I'll take those.
- Okay.

407
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,843
Carlos, are you still here?

408
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,973
I got to be downtown.

409
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,019
No, you've got to be at Hunt's Point
at 9:00 in the morning, Carlos.

410
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,487
I can't go, viejo.
- You have to go.

411
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:04,516
Take! We're still sharing the
truck with Pancho en la 173.

412
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,053
Viejo, I can't go.
- You have to go, Carlos.

413
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,157
You can ruin your life
with your muñequita,

414
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,465
but you're not gonna
ruin my bodega!

415
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,933
You have to go, take the keys.

416
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,592
So I worked on a new
color for this guy.

417
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,160
That's a great color.

418
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,468
I've got to show you something.

419
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,768
I just finished these panels,

420
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,439
I wanted to know
what you thought.

421
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,415
Jenny, go work on this.
We'll talk about this, okay?

422
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,510
You all right?
How you've been?

423
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,147
Hey, Carlos? How
have you been?

424
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,282
You all right?
- I'm fine. Fine.

425
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,849
All right, what
do you got here?

426
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,160
So, what do you think?

427
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,933
It's good!

428
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,031
Good. Good.

429
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,540
I based that one on the old man.
- How is he?

430
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,673
He's fine.
Listen...

431
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,240
can you show these to your
friend at Gotham Comics?

432
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,514
Who, Raquel?

433
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,557
Yeah.
- Are you sure you're ready?

434
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:44,025
'Cause you only get one chance
with her, you know that.

435
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,618
These are good.

436
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,462
...which I assume is how
you got the idea for this.

437
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,233
They're based on the Dominicans
who fought for La Independencia.

438
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,298
Los Gavilleros?
- Yeah.

439
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,834
They fought the US with a
guerilla waftare for four years.

440
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,780
For me, it's just another
way of talking about sugar.

441
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,874
That's what the Gavilleros
were fighting over...

442
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:11,318
foreign companies buying property
from people who don't even own it,

443
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,413
then kicking the
campesinos off their land.

444
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,688
Anyway, that's how I got
the concept for 'Europa.'

445
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,589
Carlos...

446
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,659
I've got to be honest with you.

447
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,536
I really like what you did.

448
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,007
Really?
- I love it!

449
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,340
And it couldn't come in
a more peftect time,

450
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,472
because I just lost a series.
The artist was brilliant,

451
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:42,211
but he was terribly depressed
and he could never work.

452
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,483
And I had to find something to
fill the book in our slate.

453
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:49,184
Okay!
- Great! How soon can you finish?

454
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:32,228
You never gonna believe it.
- What?

455
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:36,329
You've got to guess.
- I don't know. You won the lotto?

456
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,398
I asked Daisy to marry me.
- Get the fuck outta here!

457
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,535
I asked her to marry
me and she said yes.

458
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,512
I am high as a
motheftucker right now.

459
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,708
Dude, do you know
what you're doing?

460
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,843
Of course I know. I know
I say shit sometimes,

461
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,321
but that's just me being stupid.
I'm getting fucking married, bro'.

462
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,860
All right then, well,
shit! We should celebrate.

463
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,988
I have no champagne, so here...

464
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,862
this will have to do.

465
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,097
Here you go.
Drink away, man!

466
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:11,205
When is the big day?

467
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:13,640
All right. You know
that I like...

468
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,111
there's this bowling tournament
in Las Vegas, I wanted to go to,

469
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,648
so I figure...

470
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:21,775
I'll just take care of
everything at once.

471
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,548
Like, I got a thousand
dollars saved up already,

472
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,885
all I need is like...

473
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,949
4,000 more dollars.

474
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,620
Please, don't ask
me for money, bro'.

475
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,599
Not from you, from the store.
- I can't do it, man.

476
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,828
You told me the other day how
much you're taking in a week.

477
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,962
You don't understand.
- I'll pay you back.

478
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,098
It's not that.
- Then, what?

479
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,632
There's some shit you don't know.
- What? What I don't know?

480
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,612
Right now, for all
intents and purposes,

481
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,740
your father owns la bodega.

482
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,843
Get the fuck out of here!
- Mickey, I ain't fucking around.

483
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,979
Why do you think I
took over the store?

484
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,889
You think I want to run this?
- No, but your papá...

485
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:06,054
Yo, listen man. Your father
told me I had no choice,

486
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:09,189
Eddie's into him for
25 fucking grand.

487
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,704
How is he gonna give
your father 25 grand,

488
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,073
and he's not gonna give me
nothing? What the fuck!

489
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,806
Look, chill, man.

490
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,690
Here... it's not much... a couple
of hundred. Why don't you take?

491
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,054
Take it.
- It's okay.

492
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:46,000
It's okay, man.
I'll figure it out.

493
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,795
Mickey!

494
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,852
Remember when you were talking
about moving downtown?

495
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:45,053
Um-hmm.
- Maybe we should do that.

496
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,586
Say what?
- I mean, after Eddie gets better...

497
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,463
and things straighten out with Sean.
- That could take some time.

498
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:58,270
We're like a team, right?
- Yeah.

499
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,775
Like Paul and Belkis.

500
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,209
Yeah.

501
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:05,180
Yeah. About me?

502
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,739
What, Darlene? You learned
that word yesterday?

503
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,842
Fuck you, Darlene,
all right?

504
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,946
What's up, Angel?
- Pon la luz aquí también.

505
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,287
Deja la luz.
- This bitch, bro'.

506
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,020
Trying to convince me she
wasn't with some other nigga...

507
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,925
Can't this wait until later?
- No, it can't wait!

508
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,861
That bitch is trying to
take money out of my fist.

509
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,160
That's it!
Out. Get out!

510
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,258
Wait. Darlene's busting
you for child's support?

511
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:28,395
She's trying to tell me this
Chinese-eyed motherfucker is my kid.

512
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,531
That's bullshit!
- Un plato, and that's it.

513
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,668
Shitty day, man.

514
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,542
How is your kid in
Santo Domingo doing?

515
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,639
What, Junior?
My real kid?

516
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,015
Good, man. I can't
wait. Save my money,

517
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:46,112
soon as I get my 60 Gs,
getting the fuck outta here.

518
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,749
Go back to the D.R., live
with him and Carmen.

519
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,726
I'm gonna open
me a bike shop.

520
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:53,854
Stay with my tío in Baitoa,

521
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,989
just till I get hooked up.

522
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,796
He got a farm, and when
you're done working all day,

523
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,029
you go lay on this
hammock, next to the pond.

524
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:04,232
You just lay there, bro'. You
let the breeze hit your face.

525
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,639
You're chillin' with
your boxers off,

526
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,940
and the wind kissing
your balls...

527
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,015
Darlene is only asking
for 600 a month.

528
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,647
Guess how much she's
getting? Zero dollars.

529
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,954
The thing of it is,
that bitch rats me out,

530
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,153
I'm as good as
back in lockup.

531
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,459
That's why I don't
trust nobody.

532
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,624
That's why I don't get
no mail at my house,

533
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,295
I ain't got money in no bank.
- He's got over 40 grand hidden.

534
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,863
Maggie, what the fuck?!
- Why don't you give Carlos money?

535
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,910
¿Tú estás loca?
- As a loan to get back the bodega.

536
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,946
Maggie!
- This could be a way out of here.

537
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,572
You heard what he said,
he needs that money.

538
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,810
You were gonna give me that
money to open my own space.

539
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:49,818
Shut the fuck up,
you're family.

540
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,946
Carlos isn't family?
He'll pay you back.

541
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,922
It's my business, I can
take care of it, okay?

542
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,228
People buggin' out around
me today. Later, bro'.

543
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,532
You got a big fucking mouth,
and I ain't got no money.

544
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,830
Where did you put them?
Where'd you put them?

545
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,734
I'm tired of your fucking
bullshit game, viejo.

546
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,739
Where are my fucking drawings?

547
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,437
Carlos...

548
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,037
I should be the one

549
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,982
that would be making
the questions here.

550
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,722
How many gallons of milk
did you deliver today?

551
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,816
How many cases of
aguacate? Yuca?

552
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,123
Plátanos? Café?
- I don't fucking know.

553
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,391
That's what you should
be worrying about.

554
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,832
Where are my drawings, man?

555
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,836
Maybe I burned them.

556
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,033
Maybe I threw them
in the Hudson.

557
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:23,804
Maybe I broke them
in pieces like this.

558
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,175
What are you gonna
do about it, huh?

559
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,379
What are you going
to do about it?

560
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:40,486
You're wasting your time, Carlos.

561
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:45,728
The gringos are not going to
print your fucking drawings!

562
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,963
I want you to tell
me what you see.

563
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,597
I can't see, Carlos. I
don't have my glasses.

564
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:55,132
You can see. You don't want
to see. Tell me what you see!

565
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,744
What else?

566
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,916
He has a kind of a uniform on.

567
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,325
What else can you tell
me about this drawing?

568
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:13,987
Look at the details.
Look, look!

569
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,122
What can you tell me
about this drawing?

570
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,190
The details, what can you tell me?

571
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,633
That's it?
- Yeah. What else... ?

572
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:27,039
You have nothing else to say?
- What else do you want me to say?

573
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,079
I want you to look at this drawing
and tell me that you like it.

574
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,671
Tell me that you like it, Pa.

575
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:36,276
Your mother liked them.
Isn't that enough for you?

576
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,684
Where the fuck do you get
off bringing up Mamá?

577
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,952
Your name and hers don't belong
in the fucking same sentence.

578
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:46,018
Fuck you! She
was my wife.

579
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,461
She was your mother, okay?

580
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:51,022
Then why the fuck did you
fuck everybody on the corner?

581
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,398
And when we own a fucking
bodega, doing the fucking girls!

582
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,938
She forgave me.
- You fucking animal!

583
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,473
You fucking cocksucker!
- She knew me.

584
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,805
For me, your mother was
everything, you motherfucker!

585
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:05,041
For me, your mother was God.
She was everything for me.

586
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:08,641
I loved her, and
I still love her.

587
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,155
And she forgave
me, all the time.

588
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,959
She forgave me all the time.

589
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,398
Your drawings are...

590
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,339
inside the closet.

591
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,708
Very nice.

592
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,509
This is gorgeous! It's
gorgeous. Listen...

593
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,278
my boss gave me the authority...

594
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,377
to cut a check if this
met with my approval.

595
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,082
Holy... Raq, yeah!

596
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,826
It's gonna be a few weeks
before you get it, so...

597
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,092
A toast to Carlito!

598
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:58,190
It's all thanks to this man.

599
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,327
You did the work.
- You inspired me.

600
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,679
Well, it's not much,
but it's home.

601
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,814
It's nice.

602
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,552
We broke up a month ago.

603
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,685
That's cool.

604
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,787
Yeah?

605
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,458
Yeah.

606
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,529
Viejo...

607
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:45,733
when did Mamá first know
you were cheating on her?

608
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,605
Since the beginning.

609
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,274
I tried to play
the wise guy,

610
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,374
and say that I had
to go to the bodega,

611
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,045
or go downtown...

612
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:01,852
but she always knew.

613
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:06,156
From the peftume. And
you know what I did?

614
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:10,757
I bought a bottle of 'Colonia 1800'...

615
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:15,429
de Crusellas, la colonia cubana
to cover this... the peftume...

616
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,565
and she knew.

617
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,973
She always knew.

618
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:29,946
Are you cheating on Maggie?
- No.

619
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:40,786
Is she beautiful?
- Yeah.

620
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,862
No.

621
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,230
Hey, what would you do?

622
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,879
What would I do?

623
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,476
You know what I'd do.

624
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,218
But it doesn't mean that
that's what you have to do,

625
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,658
but that's what I'd do.

626
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:29,172
Super!

627
01:02:29,845 --> 01:02:32,305
Super!

628
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,139
What the...?

629
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:44,147
Oh, shit...

630
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,493
You look beautiful!

631
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,199
Check the ring!

632
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:11,103
Your creation!
- Thank you!

633
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,795
Do you think they got
merengue bands in Vegas?

634
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,030
Are you going?

635
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,602
Good luck, mamá.
- Stay warm.

636
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:39,868
Okay.
- See you later.

637
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:45,073
So, what did you think
of Belkis' dress?

638
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,173
It was nice.
Real nice.

639
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,156
How come you didn't
dance with me?

640
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,488
I don't know. I
wasn't in the mood.

641
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,585
I don't know.

642
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,792
Look, Maggie, maybe
this whole thing...

643
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,202
something is off.

644
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:14,037
I feel like I'm not
connecting with you lately.

645
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:17,375
Well, finally I get an
honest statement from you.

646
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,745
Ever since I was eight years old,
all I wanted to do was draw comics.

647
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:24,149
That's it! If you understand
that, you would support me, babe.

648
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,348
Support you? What are you
talking about, 'support' you?

649
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,017
What about supporting me, huh?

650
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:50,067
You think just because
you're some kind of artist,

651
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:53,775
you're better than everybody else?
Well, you're not an artist, okay?

652
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:57,808
You're just somebody whose
father owns a bodega.

653
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:02,373
Sean?

654
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:05,943
Señora Rodríguez?
Hello, Doña Marquez?

655
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:10,391
Martín? Hi, it's
Carlos. Hello?

656
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,518
I'm having a get-together
for my father tonight.

657
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,825
Can you bring some sopita
that you made last time?

658
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,956
He really likes that.

659
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,092
Beautiful!

660
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,832
Hello?

661
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,931
Hey, Mickey.
What's up, man?

662
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,135
Okay.

663
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,269
Sure. I'll
be there.

664
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,204
What's up? What's
the hurry?

665
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,847
Open it!

666
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,491
Where did you get this?

667
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,958
It doesn't matter. Now you
can pay back my father.

668
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,499
Please, tell me you didn't
take this from Angel.

669
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,228
I know you've been
working over there.

670
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,896
Please tell me you didn't
take this from Angel.

671
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:59,338
He had it hidden in some
records. I only took 30 Gs.

672
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,603
There was more. You
wouldn't believe it.

673
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:02,939
Stupid fuck, man!

674
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,946
Me and Daisy, we're moving to
Vegas. She's meeting me in an hour.

675
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,451
You're not using your brain.
Angel needs that money.

676
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,611
He finds out you took
it, he's gonna kill you.

677
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:13,882
He ain't gonna do
shit, all right?

678
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:16,481
Mickey, there's niggas in Baitoa
who'll kill you for a bean pie, man.

679
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:20,188
This ain't the island, man. He's
practically a brother-in-law.

680
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,560
He'd probably give it to you himself.

681
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:25,930
Actually, he wouldn't.

682
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:30,571
Just take it, all right?

683
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:34,666
I'm getting paid, man.
For 'Europa,' my comic.

684
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:37,303
I'll have the money, and
I'll pay back your father.

685
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:39,847
You couldn't use another
$25 Gs? Come on, man.

686
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,679
After you pay back my dad,
what are you gonna live on?

687
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,151
How are you gonna find
time to draw another one?

688
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:48,156
I'll go back to
Azteca, okay?

689
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:50,249
Fuck!

690
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:53,056
Don't tell me I did
this for nothing.

691
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,223
I did this for you, man. I
can't take this back now.

692
01:08:56,298 --> 01:09:00,166
You don't realize, this is the best
thing that could happen to us.

693
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:03,569
My father, he thinks we're all about
the Heights, but he's fucked up.

694
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,005
He don't realize we're
better than this.

695
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,134
You don't think he'd rather
be at the track all day,

696
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,235
than busting his ass up
here in some building?

697
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,303
This is our chance, man.

698
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,872
Mickey? Open the door!
- Oh, fuck!

699
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,249
The bag, the
bag. All right!

700
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:24,519
Mickey!
- All right. One sec!

701
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,458
What's going on in here?

702
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:35,800
Nothing.
- Why aren't you at the store?

703
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,068
I asked him to help me bring
down the oven from 4C.

704
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:42,042
Am I supposed to put every
single window in myself?

705
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,545
You should get back to
the store. Come on.

706
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:47,104
I've got to use the can.

707
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:52,052
Jesus H. Christ! You're
slower than your mother.

708
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:55,147
We'll see you later.
- Okay.

709
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:59,390
Lock up after me.

710
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,453
Tell Daisy I'll meet her
at the store in an hour.

711
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,744
Angel?

712
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,053
What are you doing here?

713
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,598
I used to live here.
What are you doing here?

714
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,526
I had to return
something I borrowed.

715
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:50,470
I've got to go.

716
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:01,441
'And Mickey Kilpatrick...

717
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,315
throws a final strike
for a peftect game,

718
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,946
and the tournament!'

719
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,531
I'm just being stupid.

720
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:30,478
Did you ever really bowl one?

721
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,845
What? A perfect game?
- Yeah.

722
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:37,215
Three times.

723
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,652
Really?

724
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,796
Oh, Juanito!

725
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:43,016
I wanna see my kingdom here.

726
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,496
Good work, son.

727
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,212
What the fuck?

728
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:24,616
What the fuck!

729
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,118
Where is the other five?
- What?

730
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,255
Don't fuck around with
me. Where's my five Gs?

731
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,855
I don't know.
- Oyeme!

732
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:34,391
Where the fuck is my money?
- I don't know Angel, stop it.

733
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,836
You gave it to him?
- No!

734
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,874
I fucking trusted you, you fucker!

735
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,846
Hey... hello, hello! Can I
get your attention, please?

736
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:58,120
Cállense!
- I wanna make a quick toast.

737
01:14:58,193 --> 01:15:02,186
Where's Mickey?
- He's coming, relax.

738
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:05,597
I took care of everything.
I wanna make a quick toast.

739
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,501
Today... today's a happy day.
My pop is getting better.

740
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:11,835
Doctor says if he
keeps making progress,

741
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:14,705
he'll be back to work
in a few months.

742
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:19,972
You know, it
hasn't been easy,

743
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:23,506
but we nearly killed each
other a couple of times.

744
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,045
But, we're here.
We're here!

745
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:31,722
It's his day. So,
un toast to Eddie.

746
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,900
Hi, how are
you? Surprised?

747
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:44,336
I wanna thank everybody for
staying loyal to la bodega.

748
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,738
Come on, you make it sound
like you're leaving.

749
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,346
Sí, me voy.

750
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,907
As a matter of fact, it
is my last week here.

751
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:01,752
I sold some of my drawings.

752
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,348
I got this company
publishing my comics, man.

753
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:07,418
Can you believe that?
- Oh, Carlos!

754
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:11,296
Yeah, yeah. I want to ask
Tito to take over the bodega

755
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:14,233
until the old man can
come back full time.

756
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,498
Está bien.
- Yeah.

757
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,144
I took the money back. You
have nothing to worry about.

758
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:30,548
Did Angel see you?
- No, it's all good, man.

759
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,849
No, it ain't all good. I
kept five grand for myself.

760
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,116
Aw, fuck! Fuck!

761
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,215
How do you think I got plane tickets
and the fee for the tournament?

762
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:40,261
I had to wire that this morning.
- We've got to get you outta here.

763
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,593
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

764
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,890
Give me my fucking money!

765
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,766
Chill, chill!
- Do you think I'm stupid?

766
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,032
I took it!

767
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:58,137
Stop it!

768
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:01,376
You stupid! Where the fuck is
my money? Stupid motherfucker!

769
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:05,078
Where's my money? You already
spent my fucking money!

770
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:06,848
I don't want to see
you again here.

771
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,482
Get the fuck out of here!

772
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:12,254
This ain't over
between you and me.

773
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,862
No! Mickey!

774
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,775
You saw him rush me.

775
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:37,045
He rushed me. What
was I gonna do?

776
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,816
Maggie, llama a una ambulancia, ve
a buscar una ambulancia, por favor.

777
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:43,390
Please.

778
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,619
Mickey, don't go.
¿ Tú me oyes papi?

779
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:48,821
Mickey? Mickey,
stay with me.

780
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,367
You know, when I
first came here,

781
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,531
I thought that was America?

782
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,508
Then I found out it
was only New Jersey.

783
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:47,880
Immigrants are some
ignorant motherfuckers, eh?

784
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:40,199
Juanito?
- Sí?

785
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,878
I'm closing shop.

786
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:34,080
What are you drawing?
- It's a new strip.

787
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:37,283
More Azucareros?
- Nah.

788
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:41,990
This shit's for real.

789
01:21:52,295 --> 01:21:58,990
