1
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:17,683
... chronic pain.

2
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,019
...to alleviate their
sufferings, and we

3
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,653
already mentioned
one breathing,

4
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,756
and people have to
reach a book to get

5
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:28,094
all the other very helpful
steps. What would you like...

6
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:31,064
anyone dealing with pain
to learn and take away...

7
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,699
... after they read your book.

8
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,301
That's a great question!

9
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:38,571
I think that the lesson
that I learned over,

10
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:41,642
you know, almost 15 years
of practice and working with

11
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:44,512
thousands and thousands
of people... is...

12
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:50,151
we are our own best healers.
And, the best tool, you know,

13
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:52,219
the strongest medicine,
or the best procedure,

14
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:55,122
the greatest technology
that we have is really

15
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:57,592
within ourselves.
And once we...

16
00:00:57,594 --> 00:01:01,029
we realize how to utilize
what's inside of us...

17
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:05,434
and to heal, you know,
what's been damaged

18
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:08,236
or broken. Once we...
we embrace that

19
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:11,573
and we take charge of the
power of our lives...

20
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:14,177
as opposed to giving all
the control away to

21
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:16,412
the doctors, and the ma-

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,665
- Take... can you get that end?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,471
Okay.

24
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,506
- You got it?
- A little light.

25
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:52,750
We're making
really good time.

26
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,192
You're amazing at this.

27
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:03,395
Really fantastic.

28
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,565
- I've never moved...
- What have you...

29
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,534
I don't...

30
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:17,776
- The pink... desk.
- What desk?

31
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:35,795
Ew, this is stained.
Let's switch it.

32
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:37,265
How did that get there?

33
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,900
I don't know!
How did it get there?

34
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,794
Hey, Jen. Have you seen
my Little Dorrit anywhere?

35
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:07,729
Your what?

36
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:09,599
Little Dorrit... ha-

37
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:16,773
Have you seen
my copy of Little Dorrit?

38
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:20,977
Yes. No.
Which one?

39
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:25,649
Uh, it was on my desk.
It's not in my bag.

40
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,486
It's probably in
one of the boxes.

41
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:30,921
Yeah...

42
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,425
Yeah, I guess.

43
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:36,694
Do you know where we
packed the can opener?

44
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:40,798
Um... no...

45
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,234
I'm not sure.

46
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,856
Are we cooking?

47
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:06,592
Are you kidding?
India Palace!

48
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:08,461
Cool.

49
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,604
Leave Charlie
a message.

50
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:21,708
Hey, Charlie. Jen and I
are going...

51
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,245
to Palace. If you're around
and feel like coming,

52
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:29,616
um, you could meet us there
or you can... uh...

53
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:34,956
Disregard. Cancel that.
I'll talk to you later.

54
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,458
- What?
- Couple time.

55
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,862
We just moved in.
It's couple time.

56
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:44,365
You can have your play date
with Charlie tomorrow.

57
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:55,477
I am officially exhausted.

58
00:04:56,446 --> 00:05:00,049
I feel like I'm pregnant
with a litter of Samosas.

59
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,953
You know they invented zero?

60
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,656
- Hmm?
- India. Indians.

61
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:09,759
They invented zero.

62
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:13,797
Roman numerals don't have
a separate sign for zero.

63
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:17,000
The Europeans got it from
the Indians.

64
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:19,402
It's essential to all
modern math. You can't even

65
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,671
do algebra without it.

66
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,908
But when the first...

67
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,311
crew from the
British East India company

68
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:31,315
heard about it, they thought
that it disproved the existence

69
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:35,820
of God. And they went
on this crazy rampage,

70
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,824
of rape and murder,
and so...

71
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:40,826
The Captain,

72
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:43,095
of that expedition...

73
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:44,730
No, I'm just trying
to remember.

74
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:46,898
Um, right...
He...

75
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,967
He was the one
who decided

76
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:51,403
that no one was
to ever know about it.

77
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:53,106
And so it was like, 80 years,

78
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:57,910
before it ever made it's way
back up to Europe.

79
00:05:57,912 --> 00:05:59,946
80 years.

80
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:02,014
Why you laughing?

81
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:05,418
No, it's an incredible story.

82
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,623
I didn't know it before.
I just...

83
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,392
That's incredible.

84
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,961
You are so smart.

85
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:16,130
Yeah.

86
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:18,766
How much of that one
was actually true?

87
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,834
- All of it.
- Mm.

88
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:24,371
Essentially. Well...
More or less.

89
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:25,639
You are such a liar.

90
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:32,113
I can't believe I'm shacking up
with a dishonest man.

91
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,516
You know who
I'm really gonna miss?

92
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:37,685
- Nancy.
- Nancy! Sadly.

93
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:40,088
It's really
tearing me up inside.

94
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,489
Poor Paul.

95
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,826
Do you think that
in order to ease the transition

96
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:47,563
you could, blast Prokofiev
at 3 a.m. and...

97
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,865
leave your toenail clippings
all over the coffee table

98
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,167
for days and days?

99
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,136
Oh Paul, I'll even leave
my used tampons

100
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:55,571
floating in the toilet.

101
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:59,509
It'll be like
she's in the next room.

102
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:00,410
You'd do that?

103
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,682
I like you, Jen.

104
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:09,653
I like you too, Paul.

105
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:45,224
For the people
that this was written for,

106
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:47,226
there was no question,
like that.

107
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:51,798
Fate was, by definition,

108
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,568
that which
could not be avoided.

109
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,707
And if it is... a really
shitty fate, like Oedipus',

110
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:05,112
Well, that just...
That sucks for him.

111
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,216
So, what do you guys think?

112
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:13,120
I mean, is it... fair to...

113
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:16,190
punish someone
for something that

114
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:19,126
is pre-ordained
for them to do?

115
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,732
Ah, Sophia!

116
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:26,034
What's your policy
on "incompletes?"

117
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,704
Wow, that is just
really encouraging.

118
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:31,540
Um...

119
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,509
It's nice to hear everyone's
keeping their options open.

120
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:38,881
Okay, my policy
on incompletes is that

121
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:42,852
I'm kind of a dick about 'em.
I'll give you one, if you have

122
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:45,021
an airtight excuse, but...

123
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:48,558
your story has to be
pretty impressive.

124
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,193
Okay?

125
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:52,562
Alright.

126
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:54,298
That's it, we're out of time.

127
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,935
See you guys on Friday.

128
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,771
Paul...

129
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,807
I am sure I cannot
express to you how tired

130
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,577
I am of having
this conversation.

131
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,181
Did you or did you not
march in here four weeks ago

132
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,017
and announced that you had
turned a corner?

133
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,719
I did.

134
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,287
And?

135
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:19,724
And it's fine...
I'm just...

136
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,726
Um, it's slow going.

137
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,996
Evidently, you have not
taken the substance

138
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,199
of our conversations
to heart.

139
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,136
Let me see if you
know the words.

140
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,673
What do I say next?

141
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,809
Come on.

142
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:38,711
You come on.

143
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,879
What comes next?

144
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,257
First you disarm me by telling
me how much you admire the

145
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,693
work I did as
an under-graduate.

146
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:54,995
Correct.

147
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:55,962
Then?

148
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:57,831
And then...

149
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,835
You remind me sternly
that I...

150
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:02,937
I've been through
with my coursework

151
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,873
for nearly two years,
and that if I don't

152
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,809
turn in some chapters soon...
- By Christmas.

153
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:11,779
By... by Christmas!

154
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:16,985
That... um. You will
have to seriously consider...

155
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:20,722
I will almost certainly.

156
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:23,859
That you... alright, that you
will almost certainly...

157
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:28,997
recommend that I, um,
be asked to withdraw

158
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,732
from the program.

159
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,335
Very good.

160
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:36,973
Apparently you were paying
closer attention than ya let on.

161
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,075
Paul?

162
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:13,311
What are you doing babe?

163
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,115
Sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you.

164
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,217
What's the matter?

165
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:21,387
I can't sleep.

166
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,758
Come back to bed.

167
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:31,130
Come on.

168
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,313
What's the matter?

169
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,219
You have work tomorrow.

170
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,854
Tomorrow morning.

171
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:56,124
Don't worry about it.

172
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,293
Just tell me what's the matter.

173
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:07,034
Just...

174
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:12,508
Do you want me to tell
you about the Dark Crystal?

175
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,512
Or Ladyhawk?

176
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:22,084
Ladyhawk.

177
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,019
Okay.

178
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:27,957
Close your eyes...

179
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:34,564
In medieval France,

180
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:39,402
there once lived a young man
and a mouse.

181
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:43,206
The mouse was a thief.

182
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,177
He was about to be executed.

183
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:32,826
Nancy! Hi, it's Paul.

184
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:36,096
Listen, sorry to bother you,
but um, I'm calling cause

185
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,498
I think... I prob-

186
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,568
pretty sure I left a book
in the apartment

187
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,071
of my hardcover copy
of Little Dorrit.

188
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,839
Charles Dickens?
Um...

189
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,574
I probably left it
in the living room,

190
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:51,446
on the table, but it...
it might be...

191
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:53,448
...on the floor in my old room.

192
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,585
Anyway, um, I really need it,
so if you could let me know

193
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,287
when would be convenient
to come by and get it

194
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,524
that'd be great! Um...
Give me a call. Thanks a lot.

195
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:26,283
Nancy, hey, it's Paul again.

196
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:29,119
I'm sorry to bombard you
with messages, but I...

197
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:32,355
don't know if I mentioned
the uh, Little Dorrit

198
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:34,958
the book I left,
is pretty urgent.

199
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,296
I actually need it
for my dissertation.

200
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:41,632
So, it's not like
a regular book.

201
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:45,069
Let me know, uh, when would
be a good time to come by ...

202
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,977
It is incontestable,

203
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:26,446
that the fragments of a work
that have found their way

204
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:28,315
into the popular memory,

205
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:30,584
are not jewels
of realist description.

206
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:33,721
Realist description being,
of course,

207
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:36,156
what Elliot is most noted for.

208
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:40,361
But general humanist
observations such as

209
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:42,563
the much beloved remark
about what lies

210
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:44,265
on the other side of silence.

211
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,235
This much is no surprise,

212
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,207
jewels of realist description
can hardly be expected

213
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:56,111
to retain any sense outside
their supporting context.

214
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,513
Indeed...

215
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:01,584
The relentless particularity
of realism,

216
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:05,221
the constraint implied
by that very particularity,

217
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:08,457
is one of its most
defining characteristics.

218
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:14,530
Bannister's looking
very elegant tonight.

219
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:18,068
- Very... delicate.
- Mmm.

220
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:19,403
Makes you want

221
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:22,205
to sprinkle butterfly kisses
all over her stomach.

222
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:23,473
Until she falls asleep.

223
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,110
You know, what I'd really
like to do is dribble

224
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,179
some champagne
down her naked leg

225
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,448
and drink it from between
her toes while having

226
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,716
a jacuzzi with her.

227
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,254
I want to have a contest,

228
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,556
to see who can kiss
the softest.

229
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:42,560
So um, why aren't you
hovering over there

230
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:45,096
with the rest of
the ass-kissers?

231
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:47,365
Bannister
is displeased with me.

232
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,102
I'm way behind.

233
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:52,738
Tonight I am
to be seen, but not heard.

234
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,574
Hmm.
I understand that.

235
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,644
Hey did um...
Did Margaret

236
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:00,312
stop by after class today?

237
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,181
Yeah.

238
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:05,717
Nice. She talk about
her calves again?

239
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:09,389
- She mentioned her calves.
- That is so hot.

240
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:12,792
Why don't girls in my class
just want to sleep

241
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:14,327
with the other undergrads?

242
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:18,731
Charlie, I left Little Dorrit
at the old apartment.

243
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:19,599
W-wait, are we not talking

244
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:21,401
about Margaret's calves
anymore?

245
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,704
No, I left my Little Dorrit
at Nancy's.

246
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:24,505
So?

247
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,408
It's my study copy,
my hardcover,

248
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,443
I left it behind
during the move.

249
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:31,112
So buy another one.

250
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,847
This wine is piss.

251
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:33,781
I can't!

252
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:37,485
It had all my notes in it.

253
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:41,256
- Important annotations...
- What do you mean?

254
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:42,290
You wrote in the book?

255
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,625
Yeah.

256
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,527
- All of your notes?
- No!

257
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,663
Of course not all my notes,
but... uh...

258
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:51,399
It has a lot of...
I...

259
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:54,803
...crucial new material.
New, important material

260
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:57,573
in there, and I decided
to re-arrange things

261
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,276
in a certain way that is
going to affect the entire

262
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,645
...the whole!

263
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,313
So you wrote an outline?

264
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,315
- So do it again.
- No. It's not just an outline.

265
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:07,416
It's important.

266
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:10,520
- Call Nancy.
- I called her three times today.

267
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,756
- Maybe she's really busy.
- Busy?!

268
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,192
Doing what?
Huffing Scotchguard?

269
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,428
Taking naps? She's the least
busy person on the planet.

270
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,696
You don't have to
freak out about it.

271
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,298
How am I freaking out,
I'm not freaking out.

272
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,135
- What I mean is...
- Ah! Hold on, might be her.

273
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,640
No. Text from Jen.

274
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,910
She's going to Donovan's.

275
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,580
Feel like getting a real drink?

276
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,383
Are you fucking kidding me?

277
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,555
Get a room!

278
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,265
Who takes a bath
in the morning?

279
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,000
It's unnatural.

280
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:29,537
I feel like
utter dog shit.

281
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:33,909
I might barf in the tub.

282
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:36,778
At least you don't have to collate
epidemiological studies all day.

283
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,381
Why are you even up?

284
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:41,817
I need my book.

285
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:45,487
Paul, it's okay.
You'll get your book.

286
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:48,657
Why hasn't she called?

287
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:49,925
It's only been two days.

288
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:51,728
Try to relax.

289
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,365
But... I can't do anything
without the notes.

290
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:59,602
The new... argument.
The new material.

291
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,404
Why didn't you type them out?

292
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,873
I didn't need to.
I had everything down.

293
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:08,512
Besides, hand writing
has a certain...

294
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:11,982
...ineffable...

295
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:13,517
Fuck, I don't know.

296
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,620
Oh, I need you to call
CLP and uh,

297
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,355
switch the name
on the electric bill today, ok?

298
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:19,490
Will you do that?

299
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:22,760
Yeah.

300
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:39,545
Get it! Get it!

301
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:41,547
- Mmm.
- Ge...

302
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,055
Hello, Nancy?
Nancy?

303
00:20:49,556 --> 00:20:51,624
Shit!

304
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:54,427
Cold, cold, cold.

305
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,364
It was her. It was her.

306
00:20:57,366 --> 00:21:00,033
- I need you to relax, ok Paul?
- Voicemail!

307
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:07,007
Hey Paul, I got your message
and yeah, the book's here.

308
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:09,910
So, I don't know,
just call me I guess.

309
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,545
- Whatever.
- She has the book.

310
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,816
Very good. Problem solved.

311
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:32,101
Nancy, hello. It's Paul.
I got your message.

312
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:35,904
Uh, thank you so much.
That is so great. I can...

313
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:39,942
...come and get it,
anytime today or this evening.

314
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:43,879
Just give me a call.
Thank you. Bye.

315
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:21,146
Nancy?

316
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:46,840
We've got squirrels
living in the walls.

317
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:48,075
The walls are teeming

318
00:24:48,077 --> 00:24:50,878
with rabid, bloodthirsty
squirrels.

319
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,012
You're a squirrel.

320
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:55,316
I'm not kidding.

321
00:24:56,885 --> 00:24:58,786
They're nesting in the walls.

322
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:01,990
- I heard them.
- Squirrels, huh?

323
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:07,128
I called her four times today.

324
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:10,031
- I left messages. I texted.
- And?

325
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,633
And nothing.

326
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,136
So, finally... I got on the bus
and went over there.

327
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,238
- You went to Nancy's?
- I rang the doorbell,

328
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,910
I knocked, no answer.
But I'm sure I saw movement

329
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:23,245
in that house.
I know she was home.

330
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:25,948
Why didn't she
answer the door?

331
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,717
I have no idea.

332
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,685
To torture me,
I guess.

333
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:32,922
Aw. Nobody's torturing
anybody.

334
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,026
Nancy's kooky,
but she's not malicious.

335
00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:39,162
She's worse than Hitler.

336
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:43,867
Fucking hillbilly.

337
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:45,369
Ah!

338
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:46,970
- What?
- Ah... ow.

339
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:49,206
- What?
- I grated my finger.

340
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,674
Oh god.

341
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,744
I got blood in the cheese.

342
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:58,082
Listen, how about this:

343
00:25:58,084 --> 00:26:00,385
When does Nancy
work at the restaurant?

344
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:02,053
Tuesday through Friday.

345
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:04,155
And Sunday.

346
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:05,356
Sometimes Saturday.

347
00:26:05,358 --> 00:26:06,824
She works every day?

348
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,127
Not Monday.

349
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:09,895
Jeez.

350
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:11,997
Well, why don't you just
text Nancy to bring the book

351
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,799
tomorrow, and I'll pick it up
on my break.

352
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:17,036
- Really?
- Sure.

353
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:19,204
But I mean, I don't...
need you to...

354
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:22,141
fight my battles for me.

355
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,210
I'm fighting them with you.

356
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:27,847
Good.

357
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:30,316
Problem solved.

358
00:26:57,747 --> 00:26:59,247
Nancy?

359
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:01,483
Jen?

360
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:04,453
How's it going?

361
00:27:06,155 --> 00:27:07,956
What are you doing here?

362
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:08,957
Bitch.

363
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,233
I don't understand, is she
 gonna give it back or what?

364
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:14,230
I have no idea. She was being
a super vague, defensive cunt.

365
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:16,099
God it's cold.

366
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,969
Uh, did you impress upon her
how important this is to me?

367
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,772
I really don't think she cares
how important it is to you.

368
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:26,109
Well, what am I supposed
to do? She's never going

369
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,945
call me again. Do I
go to the restaurant?

370
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,013
don't think that's a good idea.

371
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,982
She's already all pissed off
that I showed up.

372
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,484
She's just fucking with us
at this point.

373
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,353
Were you being really mean
to her or something?

374
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,356
What? Jesus Christ! No,
it's not my fault that she's

375
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,892
being so mean.
Don't put this on me!

376
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,060
Well I ...

377
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,063
I don't know what to do.

378
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,099
I mean, they're just notes,
right?

379
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,502
I mean, I'm sure
you'll be able to...

380
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:52,403
reconstruct them
if you tried.

381
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:55,273
That's not the point.

382
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:57,776
The point is, it's my book.

383
00:27:57,778 --> 00:27:58,877
Mine!

384
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,411
I've been
eminently reasonable

385
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,380
but at this point
it amounts to stealing.

386
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:04,049
She is stealing from me!

387
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,952
Of course it's your book,
nobody's disputing that.

388
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:09,255
But it seems as if Nancy's
gonna be as big a bitch

389
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:11,090
about this as she possibly can.

390
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:13,392
And what's right, isn't
necessarily what's best.

391
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:16,395
Wouldn't you say?

392
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:15,158
Break her thumbs.

393
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,492
How long has it been?

394
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:18,094
Seven and a half days.

395
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:20,330
Seriously, break her thumbs.

396
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:22,165
I'm not breaking
Nancy's thumbs.

397
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:22,899
Fag.

398
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:24,567
I'm serious.
What do I do about this?

399
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,971
One would one reasonably do
in this situation?

400
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,406
Well for starters you could
stop being such a baby.

401
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:32,343
Intimidate her, man.

402
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:34,245
Just tell her you're going
to punch her in the vagina.

403
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:36,180
She's a freaking little
elf woman.

404
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:37,848
Just put the pressure on her.

405
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,851
Won't work. Nancy is
insanely stubborn.

406
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:43,922
This one time, we'd only been
living together a few months,

407
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:46,224
I told her that if she didn't
was her dishes I was gonna

408
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:48,026
throw them all out
into the street.

409
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:51,496
They'd been sitting there
for like a week, stinking,

410
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,399
I was mostly... joking.
You know?

411
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:56,868
She gets up...

412
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,506
...collects a bunch of plates,
out the sink that belong to her,

413
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:04,076
she walks outside, and
smashes them in the street.

414
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:07,446
One at a time. Slowly.
Then she comes back in,

415
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:10,316
and never says
another word about it.

416
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:13,352
- That's insane.
- Yes.

417
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,188
Nancy's insane.
She actually did that?

418
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,189
More or less.

419
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:19,660
I mean, to be fair,
wasn't that cut and dry, but...

420
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:23,430
Fuck that! No. Fuckin' bluffing
paper-tiger diva bullshit!

421
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,367
You still have the keys
to her place?

422
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:28,068
No.

423
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,970
Alright, we're gonna go
get this fuckin' thing.

424
00:30:30,406 --> 00:30:31,072
What?

425
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:33,308
We're gonna go get
this fuckin' book right now.

426
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,575
This is stupid, come on.

427
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:35,910
No, what if she isn't home?

428
00:30:35,912 --> 00:30:39,247
Then we have a relaxing drive
around sunny New Haven.

429
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:41,215
Come on!

430
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:43,051
It's a little late to go...

431
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:45,720
Better remorse, than regret,
my friend.

432
00:30:54,497 --> 00:30:55,731
You're ok to drive, right?

433
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:07,010
Takes money to make money.

434
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:09,079
I'm gonna roll by.

435
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:19,690
She's home! She's home!

436
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,560
Wh- Pull over!

437
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:34,238
- Turn off the lights?
- What?

438
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,241
- Why?
- So she can't see us.

439
00:31:36,243 --> 00:31:38,710
- We want her to see us.
- Just for a second!

440
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,579
Why are you whispering?

441
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:41,747
I'm not.

442
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:51,056
I see her, look!
Oh... I'm gonna call her.

443
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,768
She's never gonna answer.

444
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,236
- Hello?
- Hey!

445
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:05,605
- Who is this?
- It's Paul.

446
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,174
- Oh.
- Hey...

447
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,443
Listen, I'm sorry to bother you,

448
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:11,078
but I'm right in
the neighborhood,

449
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,447
could I stop by real quick
and get my book?

450
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:16,450
- It's 11:22.
- I know...

451
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,352
- I'm uh...
- P.M!

452
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:21,321
Yes, I understand
what time it is.

453
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:23,524
But like I said I'm just
right nearby so if I cou-

454
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,226
I'm not really at home
right now.

455
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:28,263
What do you mean that
you're not really at home?

456
00:32:28,265 --> 00:32:30,331
It means I'm not available!

457
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,733
Really?

458
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:34,402
That's strange, because it
looks like your lights are on.

459
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:35,603
- What?!
- Listen,

460
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:38,073
Hey, no... Why don't you
just grab the book,

461
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:40,375
and I'm coming to the door
in about 30 seconds.

462
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,578
You're looking in my
windows?! Oh my God,

463
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,646
- you fucking freak!
- Uh, I'm not looking

464
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:45,314
in your windows. I'm parked
at the curb. This is-

465
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:48,184
This is the last time
you fucking spy on me, man.

466
00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:51,053
a fucking restraining order,
your fucki-

467
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:54,390
Hey, Nancy.. n-
Go- Damnit!

468
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:55,091
What the fuck?

469
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:56,459
She's freaking out man!

470
00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:58,295
Shit!

471
00:32:58,297 --> 00:33:00,363
- What the fuck?
- Ahhh!

472
00:33:00,365 --> 00:33:02,065
Agh!

473
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,401
Right, this isn't good.

474
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,605
Nah! She's not
going to answer.

475
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:11,208
She's not ans-

476
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,610
Nancy! Nanc- ...

477
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:20,184
Nancy, just give me my book.
Throw it out the window!

478
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:23,154
- I just want...
- Give him his fucking book!

479
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,823
Nancy!

480
00:33:25,825 --> 00:33:27,625
Be reasonable!

481
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,328
Just give me my book!

482
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,630
Just go bang on the
fucking door, man.

483
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:32,698
Don't take this shit!

484
00:33:36,836 --> 00:33:38,737
Why are you just standing there?!

485
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:46,879
I heard the squirrels last night.

486
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:49,549
Told you.

487
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:51,618
It's pretty annoying.

488
00:33:53,821 --> 00:33:56,289
Will you call the landlord?

489
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:59,792
No... but you can.

490
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:03,296
And you can also call
CLP today and get the

491
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:04,865
electric bill switched, okay?

492
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:13,874
Jen?

493
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:16,844
Uh...

494
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:20,615
Last night...

495
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:24,152
um, Charlie and I...

496
00:34:24,154 --> 00:34:26,321
dropped by Nancy's place.

497
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:27,289
When?

498
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:30,192
11:22 p.m.

499
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:33,762
- And?
- Uh, didn't really...

500
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,166
You know,
we drove over,

501
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,936
and saw that she was home
and I called and asked

502
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:42,605
if I could get the book, and...

503
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:44,807
Well...

504
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:51,380
In a nutshell she freaked out
and called me a psycho and...

505
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:52,515
hung up.

506
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:55,219
Huh.

507
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:56,787
Wow.

508
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:01,258
That was ... kinda stupid.

509
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:06,730
Well I guess that's it then.
I'm really sorry.

510
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:08,365
Right?

511
00:35:11,837 --> 00:35:13,838
I have to blow my nose.

512
00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:18,243
Right?!

513
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:21,279
Right what?

514
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:22,947
That's it, right?

515
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:24,782
I mean,
you shouldn't have done that.

516
00:35:26,886 --> 00:35:29,421
In retrospect it was
a bad idea, but,

517
00:35:29,423 --> 00:35:30,856
that has nothing to do
with anything,

518
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:31,724
it's still my book.

519
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:34,627
She's probably tearing it
into little pieces right now.

520
00:35:34,629 --> 00:35:36,362
I'm sorry but you have to
let this go, it's done!

521
00:35:36,364 --> 00:35:38,831
Dropping by on someone
unannounced is impolite,

522
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,500
I guess, but it's not on a par
with stealing.

523
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:42,702
Jesus Christ, if you
and Charlie showed up

524
00:35:42,704 --> 00:35:44,404
on my doorstep drunk
in the middle of the night,

525
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:45,472
I'd be pissed off too!

526
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:46,906
That has nothing to do
with the fact that she

527
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:49,776
still has my property!
If she doesn't cooperate

528
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:51,311
then I'm gonna go
and talk to the cops.

529
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:52,712
Paul this has gone too far.

530
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:55,282
I can't support this anymore.

531
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:56,616
I withdraw my support.

532
00:35:58,319 --> 00:35:59,687
Fine. Um...

533
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:03,958
You won't hear
another word about it.

534
00:37:55,511 --> 00:37:58,413
Un, deux, trois...

535
00:38:11,694 --> 00:38:12,494
What the fuck...?

536
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:29,078
Paul!

537
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,846
- Hey!
- How ya doing?

538
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:30,880
Jim Pehosky.

539
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:32,515
Paul Brawley.
Pleased to meet you.

540
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,783
Please have a seat.

541
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:36,719
So you go to school
with my nephew?

542
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:39,088
Yeah, Charlie and I,
we're in the same program

543
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,657
at Yale over there.
- Right.

544
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:41,825
How's that treatin' ya?

545
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:46,130
Oh, fine. Um...
Charlie's a really bright guy.

546
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:47,998
- He does great work.
- So...

547
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,835
I hear you're having some
trouble with your roommate.

548
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:53,170
Former roommate, that's right.
Um...

549
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:55,706
What happened is, uh...

550
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,441
I moved out a couple
of weeks ago,

551
00:38:57,443 --> 00:38:59,945
and I left something behind
in the old apartment.

552
00:38:59,947 --> 00:39:00,912
What'd you forget?

553
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:03,748
- Um, a book.
- A rare book?

554
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,718
No. The book itself
is easily replaceable,

555
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,620
but I had some notes
written in it.

556
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:11,156
- Personal stuff?
- No, for my dissertation.

557
00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:14,726
Um, called, uh...

558
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,963
"No Innocent Men:
Structures and Theories

559
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:19,232
of Penology and Government
in Charle's Dickens'

560
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,466
'Little Dorrit.'

561
00:39:20,468 --> 00:39:23,169
And...you don't need
to know that, but...

562
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,204
- I guess uh...
- Notes, huh?

563
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,541
They're pretty critical.

564
00:39:28,543 --> 00:39:29,876
Why won't your roommate
give it back?

565
00:39:29,878 --> 00:39:31,244
Does, does he need it
for something?

566
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:36,116
She, no. She could not
possibly need it for anything.

567
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:40,254
She's... I think she's just
keeping it out of spite.

568
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,589
What's she got
to be spiteful about?

569
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:44,658
I've no idea... um...

570
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:46,293
She's just a...

571
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:49,898
...preacher of hate,
I think.

572
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,499
This is an ex-girlfriend
of yours?

573
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:53,067
Not at all.
Just a roommate.

574
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:57,171
Well, to be honest...

575
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:58,940
There's nothing much
I can do here.

576
00:39:58,942 --> 00:40:00,708
You just have to try
to reason with her.

577
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,144
But she won't allow that.
She won't talk to me. I'm...

578
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:05,881
Isn't this stealing?
Isn't this illegal?

579
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:07,650
Did she say she wouldn't
give you the book back?

580
00:40:08,018 --> 00:40:11,120
- No she said I could have it.
- Well, then...

581
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:14,823
- But you have to understand.
- Paul! The only question here

582
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:17,259
under the law is, "What can
you prove?" and at this point

583
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,928
all that you can prove is that
she's dickin' you around.

584
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,729
- That's not illegal!
- No, but...

585
00:40:21,832 --> 00:40:24,034
But it's like she's
holding me hostage.

586
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:27,037
I need this book
to finish my thesis.

587
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:30,006
She is singlehandedly
destroying

588
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,775
my academic career!
That's wrong!

589
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,343
What she's doing is wrong!

590
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:36,212
Isn't it?

591
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,550
Sure.

592
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:40,217
It's wrong.

593
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:43,287
Does that make you
fell better?

594
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,202
...the result of choices...

595
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,570
...piece of shit!

596
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:00,939
You're stupid.

597
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:05,177
You will...
you will die alone.

598
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,685
What?

599
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:15,922
What?

600
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,992
- What are you doing?
- I'm eating.

601
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:25,632
Did you call CLP and get
the electric bill switched?

602
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:26,165
No.

603
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,036
So what did you do today?

604
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:31,271
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

605
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:32,339
Nothing.

606
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:34,341
So how long is this
nothing gonna go on for?

607
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:36,377
I don't know.

608
00:41:37,278 --> 00:41:39,647
- Paul we had a deal.
- What?

609
00:41:40,148 --> 00:41:42,883
I'm not working in the hospital
every day because I like it.

610
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:44,719
I'm just trying to
eat my dinner.

611
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,121
Your funding runs out
in seven months!

612
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:47,656
Seven and a half.

613
00:41:47,658 --> 00:41:49,391
Paul, you can't just stop!

614
00:41:49,393 --> 00:41:52,193
- I know that.
- You gonna work tomorrow?

615
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:56,031
Difficult to say.

616
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:11,778
Hey.

617
00:43:13,414 --> 00:43:15,014
I said hey, Nancy.

618
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,485
What do you think
I'm going to do?

619
00:43:18,487 --> 00:43:20,086
I just want the book.

620
00:43:20,088 --> 00:43:22,223
Why don't you just go away?

621
00:43:22,924 --> 00:43:25,760
Listen, I'm sorry
about the other night.

622
00:43:25,762 --> 00:43:27,394
I didn't mean to scare you.

623
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,996
You didn't scare me.

624
00:43:28,998 --> 00:43:30,931
I just need my book, okay?

625
00:43:30,933 --> 00:43:32,933
I told you to go away.

626
00:43:32,935 --> 00:43:36,170
'll wait on the steps, I'll wait
across the street if you want

627
00:43:36,172 --> 00:43:38,440
me to, just go inside,
get the book,

628
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:39,741
throw it out the window,

629
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,009
and you'll never see me again!

630
00:43:43,147 --> 00:43:44,980
Why are you
dragging this out like this?

631
00:43:44,982 --> 00:43:46,414
Why don't you just end it?

632
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,983
Why are you
dragging it out like this?

633
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:49,151
Why don't you just end it?!

634
00:43:49,153 --> 00:43:50,786
I... What ar... ?!

635
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:55,124
Look, come on. Um...
Here, I'm gonna stand...

636
00:43:56,059 --> 00:43:59,195
right here while you go in,
and get the book.

637
00:43:59,197 --> 00:44:01,798
How do you know
I haven't thrown it away?

638
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,833
Have you?

639
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:07,837
Nancy!

640
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:14,545
I want you to know
that I despise you.

641
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:17,414
I disliked you the first time
I met you, because

642
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,883
your hair is stringy,
and you smell weird.

643
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:21,819
But the more I got
to know you,

644
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:23,320
the more I came
to understand

645
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:26,423
that there is something
willfully hostile about the way

646
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:28,193
that you interact with people.

647
00:44:28,195 --> 00:44:30,829
And that all the things that
make you unattractive,

648
00:44:30,831 --> 00:44:33,798
and grating, are the result
of deliberate choices,

649
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,500
and that you make
those choices because you

650
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:37,902
are a worthless,
despicable shit!

651
00:44:37,904 --> 00:44:40,471
You're stupid and obnoxious!

652
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:41,940
You're gonna die alone.

653
00:44:57,791 --> 00:45:00,260
Somebody put a dead bird
in my mailbox yesterday.

654
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:02,162
What?

655
00:45:02,964 --> 00:45:04,130
A dead sparrow.

656
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:05,465
Pink ribbon around its neck.

657
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,368
In my mailbox.

658
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,270
- Why?
- Fucked if I know.

659
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:12,405
Stupid asshole
neighborhood kids

660
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:14,574
hopped up on Meth.
Fuckers!

661
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:17,245
Everything's coming apart.

662
00:45:19,848 --> 00:45:21,182
I'm all out of ideas.

663
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:28,155
- Nancy isn't gon-
- Shh. Stop.

664
00:45:28,157 --> 00:45:30,157
You... ok.
Just listen to me.

665
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:33,095
You've been going about
this whole thing

666
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,463
totally the wrong way.

667
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,298
Nancy's a fuckin'
fruit cake!

668
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,567
You can't approach her
like she's a reasonable

669
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,003
human being.
You have to understand

670
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:42,371
You can reason
with somebody,

671
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:44,339
who is un...
...reasonable.

672
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,375
You can be as rational,
as reasonable,

673
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:49,011
as right as you wanna be,
none of that counts for shit

674
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:52,248
against crazy. You could be
a fuckin' supreme master

675
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,251
of logic and rhetoric,
but crazy bitches...

676
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,452
They don't give a fuck!

677
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,289
Yeah?

678
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:02,058
I mean, what are you...
What are you saying?

679
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,093
I'm saying it's time
to make a choice.

680
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:06,463
Choice one:

681
00:46:06,465 --> 00:46:09,934
Accept the book is gone,
smooth things over with Jen,

682
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:11,568
move on with your life.

683
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,637
And choice two?

684
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,240
Stop dicking around.
Take your book back.

685
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,509
What do you think
I've been trying to do?

686
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:20,611
No, no. Take...
your book back.

687
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:23,615
You've been asking
for it... I'm saying:

688
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,951
you show up
on Nancy's doorstep,

689
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:28,053
with a fuckin' crowbar.

690
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:29,621
- Are you kidding me?
- Listen to me.

691
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:32,190
Do you want your book back?
Or do you want Nancy to win?

692
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:34,459
I want my book back.

693
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:38,029
Then it's time to graduate
to Nancy's level.

694
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:41,100
Degenerate
to Nancy's level.

695
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,570
Semantics.

696
00:47:24,346 --> 00:47:25,613
I found the key.

697
00:47:25,615 --> 00:47:26,614
What?

698
00:47:26,616 --> 00:47:29,551
I found a key to Nancy's.

699
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:31,086
Why are you whispering?

700
00:47:31,454 --> 00:47:33,489
Because I don't want
to wake up Jen. Listen,

701
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:35,758
I found a key to Nancy's.
I gave one to Jen

702
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,659
a million years ago
but she never used it

703
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:40,462
because Nancy would always freak out,
but she's still got it!

704
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:44,634
Fan-fucking-tastic,
man. Problem solved.

705
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:45,502
Let yourself in.

706
00:47:45,504 --> 00:47:49,339
Should I? I- I-
I mean...

707
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:50,640
What are you
talking about?

708
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:52,108
Of course you should.

709
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:55,078
But it, it'd still kind of be
breaking and entering.

710
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,212
It's not breaking
and entering.

711
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:57,247
You're not breaking anything.

712
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,116
What about trespassing?

713
00:48:00,118 --> 00:48:02,186
For fuck's sake,
you have a key!

714
00:48:02,188 --> 00:48:04,388
You lived there
for three years!

715
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:07,224
Go there, get your shit,
and stop whining about it.

716
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:09,393
- Yeah. I should?
- Yes! Do it.

717
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:12,063
Alright. I'm gonna do it.

718
00:48:12,065 --> 00:48:15,433
Just two minutes.
In and out.

719
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:16,467
I'm proud
of you buddy.

720
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,546
I'm meeting Charlie
for a drink later.

721
00:48:29,148 --> 00:48:31,249
Sounds pretty incredible.

722
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,188
Can I take the car?

723
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,155
Sure.

724
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,326
Try to stay
out of trouble, alright?

725
00:52:51,728 --> 00:52:54,695
Stop! No! No!

726
00:52:56,499 --> 00:52:57,699
Hello?

727
00:52:57,701 --> 00:53:00,769
Hello?
I need your help please.

728
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:02,704
There's an intruder
in my house.

729
00:53:02,706 --> 00:53:04,473
There's an intruder

730
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:06,441
in my house!

731
00:53:06,443 --> 00:53:08,377
I need the police.

732
00:53:08,379 --> 00:53:10,078
I need the police now!

733
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,783
He's in my house
right fucking now!

734
00:53:13,785 --> 00:53:15,518
I don't know!

735
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,620
I don't know!

736
00:53:17,622 --> 00:53:19,922
Get a cop here now!

737
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:37,301
So how's Jen
handling it?

738
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,972
She's expressing
her support

739
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:43,975
via icy silence and
frequent door-slamming.

740
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:48,246
How's your class?

741
00:55:48,248 --> 00:55:51,683
Sick leave last week.
"Sick..."

742
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:54,319
I start again tomorrow.

743
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:58,324
So wh- what have
you been doing?

744
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:01,127
Writing my thesis.

745
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,263
What have you
really been doing?

746
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:09,302
Daydreaming about
mutilating Nancy.

747
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:14,608
Like what?

748
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:19,680
There was one where
she was sitting in a chair

749
00:56:19,682 --> 00:56:22,649
staring at a circular saw...

750
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:26,219
The saw is on a high speed,
and she's hypnotized

751
00:56:26,221 --> 00:56:29,289
by the blade. Her face
is just inches from it.

752
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:32,627
And I walk up to her,
all casual...

753
00:56:32,629 --> 00:56:35,163
And nudge the back
of her head,

754
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:36,764
almost like
an accident.

755
00:56:36,766 --> 00:56:39,300
Her face bounces off
the blade and she falls

756
00:56:39,302 --> 00:56:43,304
onto the floor with
a giant gash. Pukes up blood

757
00:56:43,306 --> 00:56:46,175
all over the place.
Just rivers of it.

758
00:56:46,177 --> 00:56:49,678
And she's not screaming,
cause she can't.

759
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,047
Because of course,
she's choking on the blood

760
00:56:52,049 --> 00:56:54,383
but she would be, if she could.

761
00:57:00,757 --> 00:57:01,857
Wake up.

762
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,127
Paul, wake up!

763
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:17,874
What?

764
00:57:18,877 --> 00:57:21,078
I made some good.
You should eat something.

765
00:57:23,782 --> 00:57:25,216
I'm not hungry.

766
00:57:25,218 --> 00:57:26,317
You have to eat.

767
00:57:28,587 --> 00:57:30,121
What time is it?

768
00:57:30,123 --> 00:57:32,156
4:30 p.m.

769
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,825
I missed my class.

770
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:36,328
Did she know it was you?

771
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:38,030
What?

772
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:42,000
You said that she knew
it was you in her apartment.

773
00:57:42,935 --> 00:57:43,869
How do you know?

774
00:57:44,704 --> 00:57:45,704
I know.

775
00:57:45,706 --> 00:57:47,105
Did she say your name?

776
00:57:47,107 --> 00:57:48,840
Did you identify yourself?

777
00:57:48,842 --> 00:57:50,976
She knows what I look like.

778
00:57:52,246 --> 00:57:54,347
You said she called
the cops.

779
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:56,716
- She did.
- Then why aren't they here?

780
00:57:57,351 --> 00:57:59,886
If she knew it was you,
they'd be here.

781
00:58:08,763 --> 00:58:10,698
Eat some food.
It's just soup.

782
00:58:35,257 --> 00:58:36,725
I'm in the tub.

783
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:45,101
Come in.

784
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:52,074
Woah, oh!

785
00:58:57,749 --> 00:58:58,815
What are you doing here?

786
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:01,384
I was in the neighborhood.

787
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:07,524
Where's Jen?

788
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:11,428
I don't keep track of Jen.

789
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:16,768
Want a cigarette?

790
00:59:18,036 --> 00:59:19,137
Sure.

791
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:48,535
What's in the bag?

792
00:59:50,437 --> 00:59:52,272
I ran into a couple
of little girls playing

793
00:59:52,274 --> 00:59:54,574
in the street
on my way over.

794
00:59:57,178 --> 00:59:59,179
Collected their kidneys.

795
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:01,581
Kidneys?

796
01:00:03,885 --> 01:00:05,419
I'm gonna eat them later.

797
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,256
Oh.

798
01:00:12,761 --> 01:00:13,594
Are you ready?

799
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:20,368
Can I finish
my cigarette first?

800
01:00:22,805 --> 01:00:24,105
I'm afraid not.

801
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:27,375
Okay.

802
01:01:07,518 --> 01:01:10,188
So did anybody
read The Aeneid?

803
01:01:12,391 --> 01:01:15,493
Anybody got anything
to say about Virgil?

804
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:23,201
Russ?

805
01:01:24,904 --> 01:01:27,172
What happened
to your face?

806
01:01:30,076 --> 01:01:32,044
That's okay Russ.

807
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:34,380
I don't have anything
to say about Virgil either.

808
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:37,616
Class dismissed.

809
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:46,092
Class dismissed!

810
01:01:46,094 --> 01:01:48,161
That means "go home."

811
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,963
I'll see you Friday.

812
01:02:18,928 --> 01:02:21,463
Hey I'm gonna go out
with Rachel for a little bit.

813
01:02:21,465 --> 01:02:23,465
I'm gonna take the car,
unless you need it?

814
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,300
No.

815
01:02:29,673 --> 01:02:31,441
Okay,
I'll be back later.

816
01:03:31,505 --> 01:03:33,739
I got you, you bastard.

817
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,606
I'm back!

818
01:04:36,608 --> 01:04:38,575
Shit!

819
01:04:55,394 --> 01:04:58,362
What in God's name
are you doing now?

820
01:04:58,364 --> 01:05:01,800
What? I'm in the bathroom.

821
01:05:01,802 --> 01:05:03,869
I think I might have
eaten something...

822
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:22,155
Hey.

823
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:25,291
Hey.

824
01:05:27,828 --> 01:05:29,495
Got you something.

825
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:34,401
What's this?

826
01:05:37,706 --> 01:05:39,606
- What's this?
- Open it.

827
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:19,815
Kind of expected
there to be more notes.

828
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,954
How did you get this?

829
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:29,259
Doesn't matter.

830
01:06:30,628 --> 01:06:31,695
How did you get this?

831
01:06:33,664 --> 01:06:36,399
I went to Nancy's,
and I let myself in.

832
01:06:37,936 --> 01:06:40,638
You went to Nancy's?
You went in to her house?

833
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,641
God, Jen...

834
01:06:43,643 --> 01:06:45,343
That was so...

835
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:48,746
Stupid!

836
01:06:48,748 --> 01:06:50,748
- Paul.
- What if she had been there?

837
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,250
She wasn't there.

838
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:54,486
And I got your book
and now you have it.

839
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:56,655
She could have been.
You didn't know.

840
01:06:56,657 --> 01:06:58,924
She is capable
of anything.

841
01:06:58,926 --> 01:07:01,526
I called the restaurant.
She was at work.

842
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:03,929
I don't know why
you didn't do the same thing.

843
01:07:05,498 --> 01:07:06,431
I...

844
01:07:08,301 --> 01:07:10,303
I...

845
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:20,813
- Where are you going?
- Running.

846
01:07:21,749 --> 01:07:22,615
Paul...

847
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:25,952
Sit down.

848
01:07:35,664 --> 01:07:37,698
I can...

849
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,566
understand why
you're angry.

850
01:07:40,635 --> 01:07:43,438
But you can't
continue like this.

851
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,674
Yes Nancy hurt you.

852
01:07:45,676 --> 01:07:47,609
But you did break
into her apartment.

853
01:07:47,611 --> 01:07:49,010
- I didn't break in.
- But it's over now.

854
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:51,046
You have your book.

855
01:07:52,848 --> 01:07:55,417
You have to let this go.

856
01:07:59,323 --> 01:08:00,956
But what about Nancy?

857
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:06,395
What about Nancy?!
Forget about Nancy.

858
01:08:06,397 --> 01:08:08,431
Nancy's done.
There is nothing

859
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:09,965
you or I could do
to even the score.

860
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:12,668
It's over! So now you can
stop being insane!

861
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:14,937
There was only one thing
to be done, and I did it.

862
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:16,473
Problem solved!

863
01:08:16,475 --> 01:08:17,908
You think that
this is about the book?

864
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:20,310
We are so far
beyond that now.

865
01:08:20,312 --> 01:08:21,745
I'm sorry, did you just
actually say that

866
01:08:21,747 --> 01:08:22,579
we're so far beyond that?

867
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:24,348
- You're missing the point!
- What is the point?

868
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,583
I got you your fucking book,
what more do you want?!

869
01:08:30,988 --> 01:08:32,757
I want you
to be on my side.

870
01:08:34,293 --> 01:08:35,893
I am on your side.

871
01:08:36,929 --> 01:08:38,830
No...

872
01:08:38,832 --> 01:08:40,398
No you're not.

873
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:47,705
I wanna help you.

874
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:48,941
How can I do that?

875
01:08:50,477 --> 01:08:51,944
I don't want your help.

876
01:08:51,946 --> 01:08:55,481
I don't want you to fix me.
I want you to see my position.

877
01:08:55,483 --> 01:08:57,416
I can see your position.

878
01:08:57,418 --> 01:08:58,650
- But...
- No "buts."

879
01:08:58,652 --> 01:09:00,719
Say "I understand."

880
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:02,621
I do understand.

881
01:09:02,623 --> 01:09:04,390
- But...
- 30 seconds!

882
01:09:04,392 --> 01:09:08,027
30 seconds of unqualified
empathy is all I want.

883
01:09:08,963 --> 01:09:12,165
If I give you 30 seconds, will
you stop all this nonsense?

884
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:14,567
I'll give you an hour.

885
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:16,970
Shit, I'll give you a day. Does
that make you feel better?

886
01:09:17,538 --> 01:09:19,105
All I want is 30 seconds.

887
01:09:20,374 --> 01:09:21,542
Can you do it?

888
01:09:22,978 --> 01:09:23,811
Fine.

889
01:09:24,646 --> 01:09:25,546
Okay.

890
01:09:28,116 --> 01:09:28,949
Go.

891
01:09:35,924 --> 01:09:40,529
Five, six, seven, ei...

892
01:09:40,531 --> 01:09:41,997
Jesus Christ,
this is ridiculous.

893
01:09:41,999 --> 01:09:43,031
I'm not gonna
do this anymore.

894
01:09:55,546 --> 01:09:58,781
God... You look
just awful.

895
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:02,051
What's going on?

896
01:10:04,922 --> 01:10:06,789
Mmm, I don't know.

897
01:10:07,891 --> 01:10:10,092
I haven't been
sleeping well.

898
01:10:12,397 --> 01:10:14,965
Well, do you
have anything for me?

899
01:10:17,602 --> 01:10:19,636
It's not...

900
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:21,472
organized properly.

901
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:25,509
Paul, what is
happening to you?

902
01:10:26,946 --> 01:10:29,614
I've been having...

903
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:31,649
...complications.

904
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:35,687
Well, I just need
a little bit more time.

905
01:10:37,122 --> 01:10:38,756
It happens.

906
01:10:38,758 --> 01:10:40,825
I mean it happens
to everyone.

907
01:10:42,027 --> 01:10:44,563
If you do not have
your completed chapters,

908
01:10:44,565 --> 01:10:46,999
go home and gather
what you do have.

909
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:49,735
Your notes, your drafts,
whatever you've got...

910
01:10:50,136 --> 01:10:53,005
and then come back
this afternoon and we will...

911
01:10:53,007 --> 01:10:56,575
figure out a way to dig you
out of this hole.

912
01:10:56,577 --> 01:10:57,977
But what do you mean?

913
01:10:57,979 --> 01:11:01,848
Go get your materials,
bring them back to me,

914
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:05,218
and we will figure
a way forward.

915
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:09,189
- I am here to help you.
- Um...

916
01:11:11,759 --> 01:11:13,660
Like I said, I'm...

917
01:11:13,662 --> 01:11:16,564
They're, I- I don't...

918
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:21,235
They're not
properly organized.

919
01:11:21,237 --> 01:11:23,738
So... I don't...

920
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:27,141
Paul.

921
01:11:30,145 --> 01:11:32,915
What have you been doing
these last two years?

922
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:39,321
Working.

923
01:11:44,694 --> 01:11:47,629
Okay...

924
01:11:47,631 --> 01:11:50,800
That's it. I have...
done my best.

925
01:11:53,203 --> 01:11:55,305
I will take this up
with the committee.

926
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,608
I had high hopes
for you, Paul.

927
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,345
But you're a waste
of my time.

928
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:17,161
Are you working?

929
01:12:17,163 --> 01:12:20,230
Uh, I was, but...
Um, you know.

930
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:21,700
I can take a break
for a minute.

931
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:24,603
Do you want, um,
want something to drink?

932
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:26,638
I've got, um...

933
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,207
water, and um...

934
01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:32,177
and I've got... water.
Do you want water?

935
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:34,312
No, I'm just gonna
stay a minute.

936
01:12:36,549 --> 01:12:37,849
Sure. Um...

937
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:40,953
Well the offer stands.

938
01:12:44,725 --> 01:12:46,292
Do you uh...

939
01:12:48,228 --> 01:12:49,962
Do you want to sit down?

940
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:53,065
Uhhhh, yeah. Alright.

941
01:12:57,605 --> 01:12:59,206
So what's going on?

942
01:13:01,709 --> 01:13:03,377
I think Jen
is gonna leave me.

943
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,678
What makes you think that?

944
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,746
Um...

945
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:09,883
Things have been pretty bad.
And uh...

946
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,754
I'm wondering if I haven't
made a mistake...

947
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:14,956
Did she say something,
or something?

948
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,825
Well not exactly,
but we've...

949
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:20,862
I dunno.

950
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,664
Bannister is dropping me.

951
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:25,366
Did I tell you that? I might
get kicked out of the program.

952
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:27,670
Wait... What?
Bannister's dropping you?

953
01:13:27,672 --> 01:13:28,737
What do you mean
she's dropping you?

954
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:31,807
Well she said that I'm
a waste of her time.

955
01:13:31,809 --> 01:13:33,442
That she's not
working with me anymore.

956
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,344
That's not good Paul.

957
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,280
That's really, really,
really not good.

958
01:13:38,282 --> 01:13:39,882
- I know that.
- Jesus Christ.

959
01:13:39,884 --> 01:13:41,216
But you know
what this means?

960
01:13:42,285 --> 01:13:44,187
Nancy wins again.

961
01:13:44,189 --> 01:13:47,857
Destroys my relationship,
my career, with total impunity.

962
01:13:47,859 --> 01:13:49,959
Jesus Christ. Paul, I-
I can't...

963
01:13:49,961 --> 01:13:51,294
I can't sit here and listen
to another monologue

964
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:53,296
about Nancy right now.
Okay? I've got...

965
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:54,964
I've got a deadline
in two days, and I've got

966
01:13:54,966 --> 01:13:55,899
my own advisor
to worry about.

967
01:13:55,901 --> 01:13:59,002
How could somebody
so stupid, be so brilliant?

968
01:13:59,004 --> 01:14:00,304
- I can't understand it.
- For fuck's sake!

969
01:14:00,306 --> 01:14:03,741
Paul, Nancy is not some kind
of evil super genius!

970
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:04,842
The only reason she's winning

971
01:14:04,844 --> 01:14:06,944
is because you won't
take responsibility!

972
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:09,714
Sack up man! Take some
fucking responsibility!

973
01:14:09,716 --> 01:14:11,849
I'm, I... I can't
listen to this anymore!

974
01:14:11,851 --> 01:14:12,249
I've...

975
01:14:12,251 --> 01:14:15,019
You've got a Nancy problem,
you've gotta deal with it.

976
01:14:15,021 --> 01:14:18,390
I've got enough shit to do.
I've got work to do, bro.

977
01:14:18,392 --> 01:14:21,727
Work! I can't listen to this
over and over again.

978
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:23,095
You're gonna have to
deal with this on your own.

979
01:14:25,398 --> 01:14:26,231
What?

980
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:31,336
I'm sorry I had
to yell at you.

981
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:33,906
Just...

982
01:14:35,409 --> 01:14:38,878
Relax for a while. Go,
tak- take some time.

983
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,980
Let things assimilate.

984
01:14:40,982 --> 01:14:42,081
Relax.

985
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:45,218
Go home.

986
01:14:53,895 --> 01:14:55,896
- Talk later?
- What? Yes.

987
01:14:55,898 --> 01:14:58,165
- Okay.
- Goodnight.

988
01:15:16,352 --> 01:15:17,452
Marco Polo.

989
01:15:17,454 --> 01:15:21,823
Hi, is Nancy Hobby
working today?

990
01:15:59,898 --> 01:16:01,933
Your server will be
with you in a moment.

991
01:16:02,367 --> 01:16:03,267
Thank you.

992
01:16:28,796 --> 01:16:30,563
- Hey Nancy.
- What do you want?

993
01:16:31,899 --> 01:16:34,167
I was thinking
about a cheeseburger.

994
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:37,904
Oh, don't you usually take
the beverage order first?

995
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:38,638
What are you
doing here Paul?

996
01:16:40,374 --> 01:16:42,275
I want to talk to you.

997
01:16:42,277 --> 01:16:43,343
What about?

998
01:16:45,914 --> 01:16:47,448
I want to talk to you.

999
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:49,483
- So you keep saying.
- Two minutes.

1000
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:50,851
That's all I ask.

1001
01:16:50,853 --> 01:16:52,519
We don't have anything
to talk about, Paul.

1002
01:16:52,521 --> 01:16:55,155
- Oh fuck you.
- Alright.

1003
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:56,257
I'm getting
the manager now.

1004
01:16:56,259 --> 01:16:57,391
No, wait, wait, wait.

1005
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:59,126
- What?
- I ...

1006
01:16:59,394 --> 01:17:01,563
...wanted to give you...

1007
01:17:01,565 --> 01:17:06,668
One hundred dollars
for two minutes of your time.

1008
01:17:08,905 --> 01:17:10,472
Then you'll
never see me again.

1009
01:17:14,477 --> 01:17:15,443
Okay.

1010
01:17:15,445 --> 01:17:16,912
- Give me the money.
- No.

1011
01:17:17,614 --> 01:17:19,415
We have to talk first.

1012
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,919
- Half up front.
- Fine.

1013
01:17:24,421 --> 01:17:26,522
Let's go outside.

1014
01:17:49,314 --> 01:17:51,082
Can I have my money
now, please?

1015
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,667
Jen and I are splitting up
I think. Did you know that?

1016
01:18:11,037 --> 01:18:12,638
And I'm getting kicked out
of school.

1017
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,441
That sucks.

1018
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:18,143
Yes, it does.

1019
01:18:23,084 --> 01:18:27,053
Okay. Well, if that's it, can I
have my other 50 now please?

1020
01:18:27,055 --> 01:18:28,254
You've destroyed everything,
Nancy.

1021
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:30,023
Everything.

1022
01:18:30,391 --> 01:18:32,192
Are you happy?

1023
01:18:32,927 --> 01:18:33,793
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1024
01:18:33,795 --> 01:18:36,129
My life is shit!

1025
01:18:36,131 --> 01:18:37,397
Is that what you wanted?

1026
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:40,134
It's not my fault
that your girlfriend

1027
01:18:40,136 --> 01:18:42,737
broke up with you, and that
you lost your job.

1028
01:18:42,739 --> 01:18:44,405
Yes! Yes it is!

1029
01:18:45,073 --> 01:18:46,974
Why didn't you give me
my book back?

1030
01:18:46,976 --> 01:18:48,609
Your girlfriend
broke up with you

1031
01:18:48,611 --> 01:18:50,011
because you didn't have
a book?!

1032
01:18:50,013 --> 01:18:54,215
I can't, I...
What you did was wrong!

1033
01:18:54,217 --> 01:18:55,483
Fuck you!

1034
01:18:56,419 --> 01:18:58,653
You think your life got all
fucked up because

1035
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:00,022
I didn't give you
some book?!

1036
01:19:00,723 --> 01:19:02,457
I'm busy, man!

1037
01:19:02,459 --> 01:19:05,694
I'm working 60 hours
a week, at this shithole

1038
01:19:05,696 --> 01:19:08,764
and you know full well
my mom's still in the hospital.

1039
01:19:09,298 --> 01:19:12,335
You think I like spending
all my money on fucking

1040
01:19:12,337 --> 01:19:14,270
medical bills for that bitch?!

1041
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:16,706
I do not...

1042
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:20,443
So look, I feel real terrible
that your copy of fucking

1043
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:23,079
Little Dorrit wasn't my
number one priority.

1044
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:30,120
You beat me
with a baseball bat!

1045
01:19:30,122 --> 01:19:32,823
Nancy, don't you think
that was a little excessive?

1046
01:19:35,193 --> 01:19:36,060
Okay...

1047
01:19:37,062 --> 01:19:39,129
Your two minutes are up.

1048
01:19:39,131 --> 01:19:40,497
Give me the other $50.

1049
01:19:40,499 --> 01:19:43,767
Admit it. Admit your guilt.
Tell me you were wrong.

1050
01:19:43,769 --> 01:19:46,137
I'll admit it for another $100.

1051
01:19:50,043 --> 01:19:52,077
Ow! Jesus!

1052
01:19:55,381 --> 01:19:59,784
Ah!

1053
01:19:59,786 --> 01:20:03,155
I'm not gonna take any shit
from you, or anybody!

1054
01:20:03,157 --> 01:20:04,757
You think I'm stupid?

1055
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:07,827
Somebody attacks me,
I'm gonna defend myself.

1056
01:20:08,395 --> 01:20:09,528
Somebody breaks
into my house,

1057
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:10,830
I'm gonna defend myself!

1058
01:20:10,832 --> 01:20:13,332
I'm sick of you Paul!

1059
01:20:14,802 --> 01:20:16,635
Give me the other $50.

1060
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:31,751
This was way longer
than two minutes.

1061
01:20:31,753 --> 01:20:34,188
I deserve more.
Give me your jacket.

1062
01:20:34,723 --> 01:20:35,823
What?

1063
01:20:35,825 --> 01:20:37,825
Your jacket.
Give it to me.

1064
01:20:39,394 --> 01:20:41,596
- Why?
- Because I want it.

1065
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:57,346
Nancy! Wait!

1066
01:20:57,348 --> 01:20:58,714
Nancy!

1067
01:21:01,618 --> 01:21:04,553
All I wanted
was my book back.

1068
01:21:04,555 --> 01:21:07,123
How can you not
be to blame?

1069
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:08,758
It doesn't make sense.

1070
01:21:09,727 --> 01:21:10,827
Admit it.

1071
01:21:11,762 --> 01:21:13,463
You're the one
who's wrong.

1072
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:16,699
Please.

1073
01:21:18,135 --> 01:21:20,403
Tell me you were wrong.

1074
01:21:23,508 --> 01:21:24,675
Okay Paul.

1075
01:21:26,411 --> 01:21:27,511
I was wrong.

1076
01:21:28,313 --> 01:21:29,747
I shouldn't have done
what I did.

1077
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:33,217
Does that make
you feel better?
