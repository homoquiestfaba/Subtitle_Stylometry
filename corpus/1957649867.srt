 Yes.

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,418
 Time to rock and roll.

10
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,667
Major Cheung, I trust
you had a pleasant trip.

00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,668
 Major.

12
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,702
MAJOR CHEUNG: The
nerve gas has been

13
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,137
enhanced to our specifications?

14
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,271
COLONEL DIAZ: That is correct.

15
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,706
 The kill cycle
has been increased

17
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,910
 Mr. Mercier, you
realize that the ship

18
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,747
must leave by 0700 hours if
we are to avoid alerting NATO?

19
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,782
 Yes, I do.

20
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:49,950
And there won't be
any problem, Major.

21
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,318
The ship will leave
right on time.

Colonel Diaz.

23
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,620

 Mama?

00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,956

husband got drunk again.

He was arrested last night.

 I believe you have a

 I've got the best
guards money can buy.

 Forgive me if I
appear skeptical.

 We've got to leave
before the MIG arrives.

Sergei.

00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,641
 It was Messier.

00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,109
I was stupid.

116
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,979
 No, it wasn't your
fault, little brother.

117
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:11,050
Come, I'll take you home now.

118
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,118

Come on.

122
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,739
Finish her.

123
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,040
 She's just a child.

124
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,309
 I don't care if she's
your own daughter.

No witnesses.

Never disobey my order.

- Give me a kiss.
- OK.

You kids have all
the fun, don't you?

159
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,214
 Well, I wouldn't say that.

160
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,849
 Hey, how about if we
have a barbecue tonight?

161
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,084
I'll go get some chicken.

162
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,619
 Hamburgers, too.

163
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,421
 There are too many hamburgers
in your life, young lady.

164
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,423
 I have a budget
meeting tonight.

165
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,826
You guys know what
pot luck means, right?

166
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,628
 I guess it's just you
and me tonight, kid.

167
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,198
 Unless pot luck means
hamburgers, only you, Dad.

168
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,233
- Will you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

169
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,468
 Will you go to the
cleaners and pick

170
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,971
up my cheerleading uniform?

171
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,305
 Honey, I know
you're my biggest fan,

172
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,207
but let's not overdo it, OK?

173
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,809
 It's for my reunion.

174
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,477
I have $100 riding on it.

Whoever can still fit in their
cheerleading uniform wins.

 Good morning, everyone.

 We do have a front
door, you know.

where you keep the food.

Besides, it's my day off.

new job going?

185
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,901
 That's a little bit too much
information if you don't mind.

00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,436
Where'd you get that jersey?

187
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,272
 Oh, I went out with that
hockey player again last night.

188
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,407
 How'd it go?

189
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,410
 Can you say double overtime?

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,246
 I know you're talking
about boys when you do that.

191
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,848
 Oh, you're a smarty.

192
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,251
Come on, time for school.

193
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,285
 Hi five, babe.

194
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,690
AMANDA: Love you.
- Love you, too.

195
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,524
 Love you, honey.

196
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,462
That was my banana.

197
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,079
 Dad, Mom never
picks me up this late.

198
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,280
GREG: Yeah, but--

199
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,682
AMANDA: No buts, Dad.

200
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,551
GREG: --Mom doesn't
have Monster Mashers.

201
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,852
 No way.

202
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,987
Hey, Dad, thanks.

203
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:48,921
 You're welcome.

204
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,856
 Can we stop for a Coke?

205
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,492
 Oh, honey, you know what
your mom says about that.

206
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:58,831
 Fathers and daughters
need to have some secrets.

207
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,865
 Deal.

208
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,766
 Deal.

209
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,735
[music playing]

210
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,725
 I'll be right back.

211
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,590
 They're here.

212
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,958
 Can you get rid of them?

213
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,426
 Oh, I can get rid of them.

214
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,061
Question is for how long.

215
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,662
They're resilient
little bastards.

216
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,998
You know, in your lean times,
a cockroach will eat one

217
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,166
of his own limbs to survive.

218
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,501
Now, would you do that?

219
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,002
 I don't think so.

220
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,437
 Great.

221
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,372
 Oh, for God's sake sir,
please keep your voice down.

222
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,074
You're scaring
away my customers.

223
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,009
Now just get rid of them.

224
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,079
 God I love the sound of
that crunch when you pulverize

225
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,380
one of those little fuckers.

226
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,717
 Please, sir,
just do it quietly.

227
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,794
CLERK: Will that be all, sir?

228
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,862
 Yes.

229
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,830
No, actually.

230
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,298
Do you carry Forbes
Magazine here?

231
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,666
 Yes, you'll find
that right in the back.

232
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,801
[clatter]

233
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,436
 Oh no.

234
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,745
 The whole thing, yeah.

235
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,849
Whoa.
I'm all right.

236
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:57,783
I'm all right.

237
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,219
 You all right?

238
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,153
 Leave me alone.

239
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,054
I'm on level four.

240
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,889
 Full tank, dude.

241
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,891
 This is a little bigger
job than I thought.

242
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,826
 Please, quietly, sir.

243
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,960
 I'm gonna have
to go out the van.

244
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,862
Get the big guns.

245
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:10,663
 Let's go.

246
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,669
 I am gonna make a
fortune on this job.

247
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,314
[tires squealing]

248
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,315
 Amanda.

249
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,115
Call the police!

250
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:45,898
 Whoa.

251
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:46,799
What the hell?

252
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,710
What the hell you think
you're doing, buddy?

253
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,677
Don't you know it's
a federal offense

254
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,945
messing with a bug buster?

255
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,146
You better pull this
van over right now.

256
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:01,981
 They got my daughter.

257
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,784
 Yeah!

258
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,453
 Chop shop will give
us plenty for this baby.

259
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:11,023
THIEF: Yeah, it will.

260
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,992
[shouting]

261
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,059
There's a kid back here.

262
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,894
 Shit!

263
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,901
THIEF: Pick it up, man.

264
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,802
It's the bug guy.

265
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,752
 Now I got you.

266
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,886
You give up now, I'll tell
them to go easy on you.

267
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,661
That smarts.

268
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,369
All right, sir, you have
the right to remain silent.

269
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,570
Anything you say
can and will be used

270
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,738
against you in a court of law.

271
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,773
Now, do you understand
these rights

272
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,473
as I've explained them to you?

273
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,107
 Shut up!

274
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:07,680
 I got it.

275
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,089
[laughing]

276
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,660
[crashing]

277
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,039
 Oh God.

278
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,030
 Oh boy.

279
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,292
 Won't let us by
your truck, huh?

280
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,028
 Why don't you step out
of the car, tough guy?

281
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,601
 Come on.

282
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,885
[screaming]

283
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,272
Amanda.

284
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,640
Are you okay?

285
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,643
 Whoa, Dad, how did you?

286
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,411
Whoa, Dad.

287
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,648
 Listen, honey, I don't want
mommy to get upset, so let's

288
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,049
just keep this between us, OK?

289
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,517
- OK.
- All right, come on let's go.

290
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,452
Come on.

291
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,419
 Wait, Dad?

292
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,353
 Yeah?

293
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,556
 Did you get the Cokes?

294
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,958
[laughter]

295
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,626
GREG: OK, get in the car.

296
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,401
REPORTER (ON TV):
Unfortunately, the home

297
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,869
video footage was
unable to catch

298
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,671
the license number of the car.

299
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,906
Police are asking
anyone with information

300
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,275
about the unknown crime
fighter to call the crime

301
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,746
tipsters at 800-555-3698.

302
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,749
However, I do have with
me Mr. Wally Gorch,

303
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,852
a partial witness to
today's activities

304
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,453
here in this neighborhood.

305
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,656
Mr. Gorch, what can you tell us
about what happened here today?

306
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,791
WALLY: Well, Suzy.

307
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,125
I can call you Suzy?

308
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,127
Yeah, there must have
been nine or 10 of them.

309
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:13,866
Now, I fought them off as best
I could with the karate moves.

310
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,667
That's about when this
other fella shows up.

311
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,170
Now, he helps me mop
up the last couple.

312
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,206
And then I believe that's
when your video guy showed up.

313
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,308
You know, after I'd
already done my thing.

314
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,620
 Hey, handsome.

315
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,189
 Hi.

316
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,223
 How was your day?

317
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,057
 The usual.

318
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,062
 Is Amanda in bed?

319
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,666
 Yeah, she's out like a light.

320
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,903
Hey, why don't you take
a nice, hot shower.

321
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,572
And maybe I'll give
you a massage later.

322
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:57,809
 Well, that sounds great,
but I've got to get some food.

323
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,345
 Can I talk you out
of these clothes first?

324
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,280
 Tell you what.

325
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,881
I'll compromise.

326
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:06,451
A turkey sandwich first and
the massage right after.

327
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,520
 Turkey sandwich first.

328
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,589
Can I talk you out of it.

329
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,225
 Lettuce and tomato
on white, please.

330
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,059
GREG: OK.

331
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,800
REPORTER (ON TV): Not everyone--

332
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,702
GREG: Come on, honey,
don't turn on the TV.

333
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,836
 It's just the news.

334
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:25,904
REPORTER (ON TV):
City Councilman

335
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,005
Earl Chambers is
at the forefront

336
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,941
to stop the new sports arena.

337
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,376
 We don't need a stadium
built on public lands.

338
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:35,514
What we need is more
housing, more police,

339
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,884
better schools, and more park.

340
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,719
 You know, I agree
with Chambers.

341
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,120
If they're gonna
get rid of the park,

342
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,889
they should at least sell
it for a lot of money.

343
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,190
REPORTER (ON TV):
Police are still

344
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,159
unable to identify the
mysterious stranger

345
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,061
who beat up the two hoodlums.

346
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,129
Now, I know it's blurry,
Fred, but can you run

347
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,497
that videotape again, please?

348
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,932
 Your sandwich is done.

349
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,435
 Oh, that's service.

350
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,769
Hey, check it out.

351
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,506
This guy's pulling the
kung fu on these guys.

352
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,008
[screaming]

353
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,746
Hey, Greg, that
guy looks like you.

354
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,515
 Lucky guy.

355
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,416
 That's our car.

356
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,820
 Sandwich?

357
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,431
Why didn't you call the police?

358
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,899
Why didn't you call me?

359
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,135
 Maybe I should have
called you, but Amanda's OK.

360
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:33,071
We don't need a bunch of police
reporters descending on us.

361
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,041
 What do you think I was gonna
do, run down to channel nine?

362
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,110
 Look, honey, these guys
might have been in a gang.

363
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,578
I mean, you read the newspapers.

364
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,513
The less said, the better.

365
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,316
Amanda's all right, that's
really all that matters.

366
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,884
 You had no right
keeping this to yourself.

367
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,185
I deserve to know.

368
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,820
I am her mother, in case
you haven't noticed.

369
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,760
 I'm sorry.

370
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,728
I was just trying to spare you.

371
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,063
I was wrong.

372
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,464
 Where'd you learn
all that stuff anyway?

373
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,103
 In the army.

374
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,239
 I thought you said
you were a cook.

375
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,374
 I was.

376
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,711
But with my cooking, you had to
learn how to defend yourself.

377
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,179
 That's not funny.

378
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,847
 Well, it was a little funny.

379
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:16,782
 I'm serious, Greg.

380
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,250
I was really scared.

381
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,319
 I'm never gonna let anything
happen to you or Amanda.

382
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,220
Come here.

383
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,562
REPORTER (ON RADIO): If
you're thinking of getting

384
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,830
on the 405 south, don't.

385
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,432
And if you're already
sitting in it--

386
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:37,335
 How does one person go through
18 pairs of socks in one week?

387
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,704
 I'm sorry, did
you say something?

388
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,038
REPORTER (ON RADIO):
Thanks, Bill.

389
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,506
Police are still looking
for the vigilante who

390
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,709
made short work yesterday
of a couple of car thieves

391
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:44,910
in the Valley.

392
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,411
Witnesses gave
differing descriptions.

393
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,512
 Enough of that.

394
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,881
 Thank you.

395
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,349
[phone ringing]

396
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,819
Hello?

397
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,320
STRELKIN (ON PHONE):
Your tickets are ready.

398
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,254
 I'm sorry.

399
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,589
I think you have
the wrong number.

400
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,726
Moscow Circus is in town.

401
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,861
Perhaps you've
forgotten, Mr. Wallace.

402
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,437
[phone ringing]

403
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:19,511
 Mr. Wallace, you have to
pay for your reservations.

404
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,113
 I don't know what
you're talking about.

405
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,752
 Remember what I
told you, Gregori.

406
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:30,856
Never disobey an order.

407
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,524
Hilton lobby.

408
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:33,959
One hour.

409
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,827
Be there.

410
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,130
 I left the service
11 years ago.

411
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,298
ALEXI: You never
leave the service.

412
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,007
 So you are determined
to use Gregori?

413
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,742
 I can't do it.

414
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,445
You certainly can't do it.

415
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,680
Want to keep this operation
as subtle as possible.

416
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,719
The less people who know
about our history, the better.

417
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:04,122
Besides, he's the best.

418
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,691
 Mercier and Diaz,
they meet this week.

419
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,226
 Relax, comrade.

420
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:12,197
I'll make him an
offer he can't refuse.

421
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:15,066
You just keep an
eye on Chambers.

422
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,936
People are starting
to listen to him.

423
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,972
 Don't worry, I'll
take care of it.

424
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:42,994
[knocking]

425
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:43,995
VALET: Sir?

426
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,265
Thanks.

427
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:10,155
[chattering]

428
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,933
 Gregori, it's good to see you.

429
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:22,767
Sit, please.

430
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,808
[speaking russian]

431
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:33,845
 I'm an American now,
and I speak only English.

432
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,513
 I've missed you, Gregori.

433
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,882
I'm sorry.

434
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:37,916
Greg.

435
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,184
 How did you find me?

436
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:42,254
Was it that-- that
little piece on the TV?

437
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,956
 Yes, I saw you, but we
always knew where you were.

438
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,892
 Excuse me, sir, can
I offer you a drink?

439
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:47,826
GREG: No, thank you.

440
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:48,627
 Thank you.

441
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,131
I'm in real estate now.

442
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,067
It's tough for some,
but Americans, they're

443
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,602
soft like Tootsie Rolls.

444
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:01,706
We Soviets, we
thrive on hardship.

445
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,341
 The Soviet Union is gone.

446
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,944
 Yes, but the
loyalties still remain.

447
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,847
You forget, I brought you here.

448
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,382
If not for me, you
would be rotting

449
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,618
in some Ukrainian prison, along
with all those other fools

450
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,886
who stayed behind.

451
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,289
You knew that the payback
would have to come on day.

452
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,657
Well, that day is here.

453
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:19,824
 What is it you want?

454
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,228
 I have a problem.

455
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,430
I am being threatened
with exposure.

456
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,432
 As you say, you
have a problem.

457
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:31,369
 If I have a problem, Gregori
Ilyanov, you have a problem.

458
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,539
We did some terrible things, no?

459
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:39,678
Does your wife know
about your previous life?

460
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,112
 No, of course not.

461
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,949
 What do you think she
would say if she knew

462
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,251
that you were a trained killer?

463
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,788
If we are revealed
everything changes.

464
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,590
You know, in some ways, you
have more to lose than I do.

465
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,092
You made a beautiful
family here.

466
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,627
I envy you.

467
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,028
Why ruin it?

468
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:02,067
If you cooperate,
I promise you I

469
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,202
will call my friends in Moscow.

470
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,871
They will erase
your combat file.

471
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:11,276
The Gregory Ilyanov I
know will cease to exist.

472
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,578
 What exactly do
you want me to do?

473
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,647
 Cheer up.

474
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:19,451
There is something
in it for you too.

475
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,719
I think you remember this man.

476
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:28,293
You should.

477
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,562
He killed your brother.

478
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,831
[music playing]

479
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,688
[laughter]

480
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,190
 Excuse me, sir,
you forgot your key.

481
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,794
 What?

482
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:03,628
 Your key.

483
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,217
 Gregori.

484
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,788
 I thought I
recognized your voice.

485
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:30,688
 Follow me.

486
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,165
 Come here.

487
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,566
Come here.

488
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,769
Strelkin has already done
the prep work for you.

489
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,304
He's still my aide.

490
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,373
 I'm here only for Mercier.

491
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,975
 Sit down, please.

492
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,377
Give him the file.

493
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,613
This is the current
information on Mercier.

494
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,249
 And this one is for Diaz.

495
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,484
 Mercier's stooge?

496
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,219
 He moved up in this world.

497
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,322
He now handles all
Mercier's arms deals.

498
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,757
 What about Mercier?

499
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,659
 Moved into drugs.

500
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,463
 Mercier has a criminal
indictment pending.

501
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,565
He's looking to make a deal.

502
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:18,303
He's trying to peddle
information on me.

503
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:20,705
 What exactly do you
want me to do about it?

504
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,942
 What you do so well, kill him.

505
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,247
 That's not me anymore.

506
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,516
I've got a family now.

507
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,685
I haven't held a
gun in 11 years.

508
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,386
ALEXI: But you have the skill.

509
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:40,458
Remember, we saw
you a few days ago.

510
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,528
 I only did that because
my daughter was in danger.

511
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,363
Get him to do it.

512
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,365
 Look at his hand.

513
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:51,102
 I can still kill,
if I'm close enough.

514
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:55,840
 We're handing Mercier to
you on a silver platter.

515
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,041
 When?

516
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,979
 The two of you will
travel to Detroit tomorrow.

517
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,814
 Tomorrow?

518
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,183
I have plans with
my wife tomorrow.

519
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:08,486
 She can go to the
reunion by herself.

520
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,321
We do our homework.

521
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,258
 And since we are
all capitalists here,

522
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:17,428
there's $50,000 in it for you.

523
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,364
No strings attached.

524
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,933
 You can keep your money.

525
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:27,138
All I want is your word of honor
that this will be the only hit.

526
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,072
 You have my word.

527
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,717
 Hey, you look great.

528
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:16,120
 Why do you have
a suitcase packed?

529
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,390
 Because I have to go
to Detroit this weekend.

530
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,059
 You've got to be joking.

531
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,727
What about my reunion?

532
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,461
 I know.

533
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,796
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,798
They didn't give me any notice.

535
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:30,101
There's some kind of a problem
with the McKendry account.

536
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,437
 I thought you were off
the McKendry account?

537
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,672
 I was.

538
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:39,110
But some problems with the
stock options not going through.

539
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,981
If I don't go this weekend,
we're gonna lose the account.

540
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,917
 So when were you planning
on telling me all of this?

541
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,485
 After Amanda went
to bed tonight.

542
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,590
 Greg, I'm not mad.

543
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,860
I know it's not your fault.
I'm just disappointed.

544
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,963
You know how long I've been
looking forward to this.

545
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:03,568
I wanted to show you off
to all my old friends.

546
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,870
 I'm really sorry, honey.

547
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,306
Look, you just give
me this weekend,

548
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:10,041
and I promise I'll
make it up to you.

549
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,718
 Wow, look at that
pretty picture.

550
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,854
 It's gonna be a
mommy killer whale.

551
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:23,588
 Really?

552
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,689
Should've known.

553
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,271
 Hey, I just saw Greg
leaving with a suitcase.

554
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,540
Where is he going?

555
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,675
 Detroit.

556
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:44,842
 Honey, what
about your reunion?

557
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,815
Let me guess, business trip?

558
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,749
Mhm.

559
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,484
 Yeah.

560
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,720
 Remember Bill, my
first ex-husband?

561
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,122
He used to go on a
lot of business trips.

562
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,292
One day he came home, I
checked his briefcase.

563
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,427
Guess what?

564
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,761
Completely empty.

565
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,299
 Not Greg.

566
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,567
 No, not Greg.

567
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,402
He's one of the best.

568
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:15,540
I'm just once bitten, twice shy.

569
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,442
 Shy?

570
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,644
 Not exactly.

571
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,645
Hey, you got any coffee?

572
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,125
[music playing]

573
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,787
 Diaz has the guns now.

574
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:05,957
Mercier has raised
his usual price,

575
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,492
but they think the
deal with Cubans

576
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,727
will go down tonight anyway.

577
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,095
 Where's Mercier?

578
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,365
 No sign of him yet,
but he'll be there.

579
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,268
He doesn't trust Diaz that much.

580
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,270
 It's just a few guards.

581
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,805
 Diaz has gotten lazy.

582
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:24,275
Living in America
does that to you, huh?

583
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:28,546
But don't you worry, there will
be plenty of security tonight.

584
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,480
 Precision hit.

585
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,816
Limited access.

586
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,951
It's not gonna be easy.

587
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,186
 You'll have to get close.

588
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,501
 Hi, honey, it's me.

589
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,270
I didn't want to bother
you at the office.

590
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,071
I just wanted to tell
you that I'm sorry.

591
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,308
And if there was any way I could
have been there for you today,

592
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,277
I would've.

593
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,478
My appointments here.

594
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:02,080
I'll call you from the airport.

595
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,016
Love you.

596
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:05,883
You got it?

597
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,191
STRELKIN: Six shot .38, custom
silencer, and three clips.

598
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,827
Black Talons.

599
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:18,429
GREG: I asked for a Beretta.

600
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,531
 That's Alexi's choice.

601
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,134
 Then let Alexi do it.

602
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,770
Next time I ask for something,
you deliver exactly that,

603
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,472
or I take the next plane home.

604
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:29,607
 Are you forgetting something?

605
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,810
You work for us.

606
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,979
You do as we say.

607
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,787
[phone ringing]

608
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,559
Yes?

609
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,496
I'll be there.

610
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:54,332
Diaz has arrived.

611
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:58,569
And Merc may be in town already.

612
00:43:58,569 --> 00:43:59,670
I'll be back in an hour.

613
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,075
This is not over.

614
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,653
[music playing]

615
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,447
 Cold out here tonight.

616
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:49,420
 Here they come.

617
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:32,196
 Cubans are here.

618
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,899
 Okay, gentlemen, time
to make some money.

619
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,403
Keep your eyes open.

620
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,871
I don't trust these guys.

621
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,250
[music playing]

622
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,823
[speaking spanish]

623
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,960
 I trust that you
brought the money.

624
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,329
 In bearer bonds,
as you requested.

625
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,367
Where's your boss, Mercier?

626
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:48,105
 He got stuck in L.A.
[speaking spanish] Business.

627
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:52,310
But when you deal with
me, you deal with him.

628
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,778
 I don't deal with
flunkies, all right?

629
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:55,579
You get your goddamn
boss down here

630
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,314
right now before I get angry.

631
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:00,518
I'm just kidding.

632
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:01,619
Hey, just relax guys.

633
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:02,853
Relax.

634
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:03,888
I always wanted to
say that, you know?

635
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,623
Just like on the television.

636
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:07,491
 Messier isn't here.

637
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,360
Only Diaz.

638
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,227
 Where are the guns?

639
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,099
 Send them.

640
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,609
CUSTOMER: What the
hell is this, huh?

641
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,645
Going on a field trip?

642
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:28,979
To the zoo, maybe?

643
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,816
 Cops check trucks.

644
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:32,616
Not buses.

645
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,628
STRELKIN: Gregori, do Diaz now.

646
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,931
 I'm here only for Mercier.

647
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,666
 So he couldn't make it.

648
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,534
Kill Diaz.

649
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,903
 You're a smart guy, Diaz.

650
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,073
Gonna send you guys
some Cuban cigars.

651
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,008
They're illegal here, you know.

652
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,377
Makes them taste
better don't you think?

653
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,547
 State of the art.

654
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,149
 This is bullshit.

655
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:06,751
Mercier's supposed to be here.

656
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:09,787
 Well, he isn't Do it.

657
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:11,889
DIAZ: 30 cases,
ready for shipment.

658
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,761
 Our deal was for 40 cases.

659
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:20,164
 Yes, but customs is
cracking down on us right now.

660
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:23,400
 When we say 40 cases,
we mean 40 cases.

661
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,870
STRELKIN: Gregori, you have
to [inaudible] him, damn it.

662
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,438
 This time, I am not joking.

663
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:28,439
 Set up!

664
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:31,342
[gunshots]

665
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,410
 Save him!

00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:37,768
 Sorry.

 Slower cars move to the right!

671
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,802
Wanna play with the big boys?

672
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,203
Come on.

675
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,224
Shit.

682
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,293
 Nice driving.

683
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,564
You cut it close.

684
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,265
 Too close.

685
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,333
Come on, go, go!

686
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:12,456
You're home early.

687
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,560
 My lunch meeting canceled.

688
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,603
 Maybe we can get
Stephanie to babysit Amanda.

689
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,272
We could go to
dinner tonight, huh?

690
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,711
So you were gone when
I got up this morning.

691
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,948
 I had an early conference
with John and Tracy.

692
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,349
AMANDA: Daddy.

693
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,219
Daddy, come see.

694
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,253
 I'll be right back.

695
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:54,565
OK, let's see.

696
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,415
All right, that was good.

697
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,266
She's fine.

698
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,667
She really loves her new toys.

699
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:34,905
So how did the reunion go?

700
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:37,040
 I didn't go.

701
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,244
 Why not?

702
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:41,712
 Because I didn't
want to go without you.

703
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,783
[phone ringing]

704
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,618
 I'm sorry, honey.

705
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,019
I know how much it meant to you.

706
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,425
 Hello?

707
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:58,929
It's for you.

708
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:06,570
 Hello.

709
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,339
ALEXI (ON PHONE):
Congratulations, Diaz is dead.

710
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,841
A little messier than
I would have liked,

711
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:14,278
but you can't make an omelet
without breaking some eggs.

712
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:16,446
 Look, you got what you wanted.

713
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:17,648
I'm done.

714
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,516
ALEXI (ON PHONE):
Not yet, Gregori.

715
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,185
Mercier still breathes.

716
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:22,486
 I don't care.

717
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,821
I want out.

718
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,556
ALEXI (ON PHONE): That
is not our arrangement.

719
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:29,660
Be at the hotel in one
hour, and don't be late.

720
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:36,166
 I did the job in Detroit.

721
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,634
Diaz is dead.

722
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,737
The fact that Mercier wasn't
there is not my fault.

723
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:46,009
 May not be your fault,
but it is your problem.

724
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,578
What do you think the
media would do if they

725
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,646
found those photographs?

726
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,548
Why should Mercier
have all the fun?

727
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,283
Drugs, women, you name it.

728
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,785
While your life
is falling apart,

729
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:58,088
and your brother, Sergei, is
rotting in a Spanish grave

730
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:58,889
unavenged.

731
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,662
 You gave me your word.

732
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,764
Doesn't that mean
anything to you anymore?

733
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,334
 Not since I moved
to L.A. Now, it

734
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:13,337
so happens that
Mercier has developed

735
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,639
an unhealthy heroin habit.

736
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:19,076
He's having a party this
afternoon to which you, posing

737
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:21,545
as a drug dealer, will attend.

738
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,413
One of his party girls
will be waiting for you.

739
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:27,985
She will get you into the party,

740
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:28,986
 This afternoon?

741
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:29,820
 Yeah.

742
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:35,359
 All right.

743
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,828
[music playing]

744
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:14,998
Katherine?

745
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:18,769
Honey?

746
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:26,843
Amanda?

747
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,115
Katherine?

748
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,821
Honey?

749
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:38,722
Damn it.

750
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,809
Katherine!

751
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,477
 What?

752
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,611
 Didn't you hear me?

753
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,513
What the hell have
you been doing?

754
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:04,448
 Gardening.

755
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:05,849
What's it look like?

756
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:08,418
 The front door is open,
and the window is broken.

757
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,753
What is going on?

758
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:11,121
 I locked myself out.

759
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:12,956
I had to break the window
to get in the house.

760
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,125
Then I left the
door open, sorry.

761
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,293
 Where's Amanda?

762
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:17,260
 Greg, it's Tuesday.

763
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,096
She's at dance class.

764
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:20,597
 Right.

765
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,499
OK, that's it.

766
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,900
 What's it?

767
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,236
 I'm under a lot of
pressure at work right now.

768
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,705
I want you to take Amanda and
go stay at Stephanie's dad's

769
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,140
cabin in Arrowhead for a while.

770
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,274
Will you do that?

771
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,442
 What are you talking about?

772
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,677
We're not going anywhere.

773
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,312
 Do me a favor, will you?

774
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:37,347
Listen to me, just this once.

775
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,015
 No, would you do me a favor?

776
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,752
If you want to clear us out
to turn our home into a love

777

nest with another
woman, don't give me

778
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:46,857
some lame ass excuse
about work and pressure

779
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:47,891
and all that garbage.

780
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,596
 Another woman.

781
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:54,331
What are you talking about?

782
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:55,565
 I know why you
went to Detroit.

783
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:56,800
 Oh you do, do you?

784
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,368
 But if you're gonna
ruin what we have,

785
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,405
I wish you'd at least have guts
enough to do it to my face.

786
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:04,641
 OK, I will.

787
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:08,245
I have kept some
things from you.

788
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:09,946
I was in the army.

789
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,715
 What does that
have to do with it?

790
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:14,217
 It wasn't the American army.

791
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,852
It was the Russian army.

792
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:16,787
 What?

793
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:19,022
 There are some
men from my past.

794
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,792
They want me to do
something for them.

795
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:24,428
If they don't get what they
want, they might hurt you.

796
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:27,397
They might even hurt Amanda.

797
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,100
The police can't stop them.

798
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,735
There's really only
one thing that can.

799
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,908
If there was ever a time
I needed you to believe

800
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,777
in me, honey, it's now.

801
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:45,916
 I trust you, Greg.

802
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,018
But if anything happens
to our daughter--

803
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:51,521
 I'm not gonna let anything
happen to either one of you.

804
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,690
Now, please, go pack your bags.

805
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,559
I'll call Stephanie.

806
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,995
I'll have her pick
you up after work.

807
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,198
 OK, but you have
a lot of explaining

808
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:05,135
to do when you get back.

money to [inaudible] when

811
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:26,556
she introduces you to Mercier.

812
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,958
 What about the weapon?

813
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:31,261
 I'm sure there will be
plenty of metal detectors.

814
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:32,796
You are the weapon.

815
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,716
Meet Fawn, old friend of mine.

816
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:53,884
 Hi, I'm Nick.

817
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,151
 Nice to meet you, Nick.

818
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:02,025
 Fawn is a regular
at Mercier's parties.

819
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,761
You will go in as
a her new supplier.

820
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,731
 So I get you in, and
then I get the money.

821
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,533
That's all I have to do, right?

822
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,501
 That's all.

823
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,904
 You like partying, Nick?

824
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:16,540
 I'm married, thanks.

825
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,374
 Who isn't?

826
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,296
Hey, Frankie.

Did you miss me?

829
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,649
GREG: So are these
all Mercier's friends?

830
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,352
 Guys like Mercier
don't have friends.

831
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:03,987
They have associates.

832
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:06,356
You either have something
that he wants to buy,

833
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:09,893
or you want to buy
something he's got to sell.

834
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,862
 And where do you
fit in on that plan?

835
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:15,832
 Don't judge me, Nick.

836
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:19,970
I've got something
all men want to buy.

837
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:23,440
I get you into this party,
you give me the money.

838
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,342
We're associates.

839
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:26,876
 Fair enough.

so where's my money?

844
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:44,294
 Look, he's around someplace.

845
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:46,262
He's always around.

846
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,432
 Yeah, well I need
an introduction.

847

 You see, there you go
changing our relationship, Nick.

848
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,571
We had a deal.

849
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:57,607
 No, your deal
was with Strelkin.

850
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,443
No Mercier, no money.

851
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,947
 Well, then maybe we
should look upstairs.

852
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:04,948
 Good choice.

853
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,470
 Well, he should
be here somewhere.

854
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,638
 Hey, how you doing, Fawn?

855
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,706
 Hey.

856
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:30,974
 Who's your friend?

857
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,175
 Oh, this is Nick.

858
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,343
You better be nice to him.

859
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:35,345
He's one of Colonel
Diaz's friends.

860
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:39,482
This is Dominic,
Mercier's associate.

861
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,450
 I want a drink.

862
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,885
Make yourself useful, huh?

863
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:43,420
 Sure.

864
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,990
 So you're a friend
of Colonel Diaz, huh?

865
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,792
 That's right.

866
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:51,695
 How come I've never
seen you with him?

867
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:55,565
 Well, I like to
keep a low profile.

868
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,800
 Diaz does too.

869
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,769
About six feet low.

870
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:02,806
 Well, Mercier
won't mind if I take

871
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:05,408
care of deliveries from now on.

872
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,243
 We'll see Come with me.

873
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,090
 So where's the boss?

874
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,091
 He'll want a sample.

875
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:22,125
 Show me the money.

876
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,631
 You know who the hell
you're dealing with?

877
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,401
 You better be a hell of
a lot faster than you look.

[shouting]

879
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:42,879
 Dominic.

880
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:43,980
That's enough, Dominic.

881
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:48,952
 Take a hike.

882
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,355
 Later.

883
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,803
 I hear you got
some private stock.

884
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:08,037
 It's expensive.

885
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,577
 I think I can afford it

886
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,446
 Pure heroin.

887
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:18,481
None better.

888
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:19,282
MERCIER: Pure heroin.

Pure horse shit.

01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:29,926
What are you trying to pull?

891
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,227
 I don't understand.

892
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,763
My brother, he said
it was the real stuff.

893
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,731
 You brother?

01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:36,933
Well, screw your brother.

895
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,602
 You already
screwed my brother.

896

bad at the last minute?

915
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,225
Down to the water.

916
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,360
Heading into the park.

917
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,336
Let's split up.

918
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,350
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

919
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:08,384
 Well, keep looking.

920
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:41,617
[music playing]

921
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:08,511
HENCHMAN: Hold him up.

922
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:42,311
 Freeze, asshole.

923
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,313
I don't now who the
hell you think you are.

924
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,115
You think you can come
in to our party, huh?

925
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,284
Screw with me, kill
my boss, then what?

926
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,119
Run over here and
play in the park?

927
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,421
Well, screw you, asshole.

928
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,531
 Hurry, police are on the way.

929
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:15,838
[music playing]

930
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,011
 Where are they?

931
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:55,878
 Your family is fine.

932
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,584
 I could kill you now
and then find Strelkin.

933
01:12:01,584 --> 01:12:02,718
 You know me better than that.

934
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:03,920
If you hurt me, they will die.

935
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,426
That's better.

936
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,698
[speaking russian]

937
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:21,704
 If you hurt them in any way--

938
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:25,107
 Gregori, to hurt them now
would be not only stupid,

939
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:28,110
but it would be un-American.

940
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,679
I have one more task for you.

941
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:36,385
One measly little task for you.

942
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,821
 We don't need a stadium
built on public lands.

943
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:45,094
What we need is more housing,
better schools, and more parks.

944
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:48,197
 Chambers will be in
Clarion Park tomorrow at noon

945
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:52,468
before the rally to prepare
for his media circus.

946
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:53,769
It's 200 yards.

947
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:56,639
It's difficult. But
for you, piece of cake.

948
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:59,675
You know, I love that
American vernacular.

949
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,210
 Chambers is not a drug dealer.

950
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,413
You don't have
any past with him.

951
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:07,550
 Did I say I did?

952
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,486
 This is not about
exposure, is it?

953
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:13,489
This is about the state.

954
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,692
 Welcome to reality, Gregori.

955
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:21,297
I now own the lion's share of
a professional football team.

956
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:23,966
We need a stadium
for them to play in.

957
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,835
It's as simple as that.

958
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:29,405
 Mercier never, ever threatened
you with exposure then, did he?

959
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,439
 No.

960
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,341
 You were a gunrunner with him.

961
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:36,045
That's how you made the money to
pay for the stadium, isn't it?

962
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:39,482
That's why you wanted him
killed, just in case somebody

963
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:44,120
like Chambers might
look into your past.

964
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,756
 That's good, Greg.

965
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:47,890
Good.

966
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,359
You do not succeed in
this country in business

967
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:52,228
unless you step on some toes.

968
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:54,664
Oh, don't look so shocked.

969
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:55,698
That's what I'm doing.

970
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:57,767
I'm living the American dream.

971
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,636
 I don't think too many CEOs
have murder on their resume.

972
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,973
 I have sunk $10 million
dollars into that stadium.

973
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:05,041
Into that team.

974
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,610
I think that's very
American, don't you?

975
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,578
Now you think I'm
going to see that all

976
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,048
lost because of some
loudmouth politician who's

977
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:12,782
looking for votes?

978
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,351
No, I don't think so.

979
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:18,754
And you are going to ensure
that that does not happen.

980
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,361
KATHERINE (ON PHONE):
Honey, we're OK so far,

981
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,595
but please do what he says.

982
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:27,930
AMANDA (ON PHONE):
Daddy, help us.

983
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:28,731
I'm so scared.

984
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:37,540
 One condition.

985
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,475
 I'm listening.

986
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,078
 I see my family
before I do the hit.

987
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:43,179
 You'll see them.

988
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:46,048
 And the moment I do
it, you release them.

989
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:46,982
Agreed?

990
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:50,052
 Why not?

991
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:52,288
Strelkin will be
waiting for you at four

992
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:55,157
this afternoon in the park.

993
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,058
Don't keep him waiting.

994
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,568
Go get some rest.

995
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:30,393
 What's our position?

996
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:32,661
 Brownfield Plaza Hotel.

997
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,264
Our cover, elevator repairmen.

998
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,266
Security is a joke there.

999
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,468
Virtually doesn't exist.

1000
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,503
 What am I using?

1001
01:15:40,503 --> 01:15:44,306
 Remington with Leupold scope.

1002
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,308
Subsonic ammunition.

1003
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:50,146
Personally, the radio bomb
would have done it for me.

1004
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:55,151
 And kill maybe 100 innocent
people instead of one?

1005
01:15:58,487 --> 01:15:59,755
 What's the difference?

1006
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,026
GREG: This thing is too rushed.

1007
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:04,927
I don't like it.

1008
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,362
There's going to be mistakes.

1009
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:07,863
STRELKIN: It's going to be fine.

1010
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:10,433
GREG: Is that what
you told my family?

1011
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:12,435
STRELKIN: It's only 200 yards.

1012
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:13,869
I saw you do a mile.

1013
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,404
GREG: Not like this.

1014
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,373
I had more time.

1015
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,809
STRELKIN: His car will arrive
two hours before the rally

1016
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:22,645
at approximately 1100 hours.

1017
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:27,817
He'll go to the stage to
check the preparations.

1018
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:32,321
The best shot will be before
he reaches the podium.

1019
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:35,291
 That's my department.

1020
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:38,394
What happens afterwards?

1021
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:40,362
 A car will be waiting for us.

1022
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,332
 Then what?

1023
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,134
 That's my department.

1024
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,373
All right.

1025
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:53,342
 It's gonna be okay honey.

1026
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,678
 Mom, where's Stephanie?

1027
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,780
 She's in heaven.

1028
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,781
 I'm so scared.

1029
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:02,852
 It's gonna be OK.

1030
01:17:02,852 --> 01:17:06,255
Daddy's gonna help us.

1031
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:08,691
[music playing]

1032
01:17:16,432 --> 01:17:17,800
 Little wind.

1033
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,336
Low humidity.

1034
01:17:20,336 --> 01:17:23,239
Conditions are good, Gregori.

1035
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,040
 Where's my family?

1036
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:25,875
 Nearby.

1037
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:31,981
Base?

1038
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,082
ALEXI (ON RADIO): Copy.

1039
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:34,350
 Condition red.

1040
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:36,285
ALEXI (ON RADIO):
Understood, vanguard.

1041
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:37,119
Running red.

1042
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:48,130
 So in 10 minutes your problems
will be over, unless you miss.

1043
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:57,306
 For our good and the
betterment of all our families.

1044
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:59,909
Isn't that laying it
on a little thick?

1045
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,777
 So far you've been
getting great press

1046
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,245
on the nightly news.

1047
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,314
People are looking
for anything to take

1048
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:08,384
the blame for their
problems, television,

1049
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:11,053
guns, movies, sports stadiums.

1050
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,961
 It'll get you votes.

1051
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:22,231
 OK, I'll say it.

1052
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:23,832
ALEXI (ON RADIO): Three
minutes, vanguard.

1053
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,011
 I want to see my family.

1054
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:42,551

1055
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,552
ALEXI (ON RADIO): Copy.

1056
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,920
 Daddy wants to say hi.

1057
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,988
ALEXI (ON RADIO): Put him on.

1058
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:51,794
 Where are they?

1059
01:18:51,794 --> 01:18:52,962
ALEXI (ON RADIO): Safe.

1060
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:55,331
 All right, no
more messing around.

1061
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:59,201
I see my family now
or I walk, Alexi.

1062
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,836
ALEXI (ON RADIO): Fair enough.

1063
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,605
The side of the building.

1064
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,673
Look down.

1065
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,375
You'll see a blue van.

1066
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:24,126
 What about Amanda?

1067
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:28,397
 Dad.

1068
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:30,499
 Amanda are you all right?

1069
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,800
AMANDA (ON RADIO): I guess so.

1070
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,136
Mom says we'll be all right.

1071
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:38,073
 And they will be, too, as
long as you follow instructions.

1072
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,608
 I want to see her now.

1073
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,444
 No, no, no, I do not show
you both at the same time.

1074
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,445
I need to protect myself.

1075
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,591
AMANDA: Mommy.

1076
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:57,726
 Here, come here.

1077
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:58,927
Are you OK?

1078
01:19:58,927 --> 01:19:59,928
 I'm fine.

1079
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:00,996
 Daddy's up there.

1080
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:15,110
 Hello, good to see you.

1081
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,779
Thank you for being here.
Thank you so much.

1082
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:17,713
 It's a pleasure.

1083
01:20:17,713 --> 01:20:18,714
 Good to see you.

1084
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:20,816
 Hello, how are you?

1085
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,884
 This is never gonna happen.

1086
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:27,589
 Here he is.

1087
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:35,931
Not a worry in the world.

1088
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,900
CHAMBERS: Oh, thank you.

1089
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,802
Thank you for coming.
- Go get them.

1090
01:20:39,802 --> 01:20:41,904
 Thank you for
being here, buddy.

1091
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:43,872
Can't do it without
you, you know that.

1132
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,509
 They took Amanda.

1133
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:02,678

1166
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:13,802
You leave.

1167
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:14,770
You get away.

doing, Gregori.

right angle from there.

01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,324
You need a rifle, not a pistol.

Now, put the weapon down.

think about it,

1182
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:45,434
I put my hand over
her nose and mouth.

1183
01:26:45,434 --> 01:26:47,936
Would that help to
speed up the process?
