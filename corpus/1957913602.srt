Why would they bother you
with that?

557
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,864
Maybe because I promised them
that I would do it.

It was always important to Mark.

- About Mark?

figured it out already.

as telling him.

anything out about you.

he wanted to see my work.

00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:58,095
By the time I was 12 or 13, I
was clearing and pouring beers.

678
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:01,858

- A different time.

680
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:06,983
And my mom died
when I was just a kid,

681
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:11,628
so, um, the bar just...

682
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,192
always felt like home, you know?

683
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:17,114
I'm sorry.

684
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:19,076

685
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:21,879
this feels like
where my family is.

686
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:25,208
Mm.

687
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,215
You didn't ever wanna do
anything else?

688
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:31,808
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a dinosaur.

689
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:33,690
And then an astronaut.

690
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:35,220
But, um, before I had any time

691
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:38,219
to put any real sincere thought
into my future,

692
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,898
uh, the path with the bar
was already laid out for me.

693
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:44,621
Uh, it feels really good
to get out of my little world

694
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:46,231

you can be honest with me, too.

- Hm.

703

really dumb with me tomorrow?

00:48:22,168 --> 00:48:24,164
Ignoring the right things.

1017
00:48:24,165 --> 00:48:25,722
But, uh, you think
it's something

1018
00:48:25,723 --> 00:48:27,171
that could end you two?

1019
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:33,570
I mean, I, I hadn't been
thinking that, but, uh, maybe.

1020
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:36,178
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

1021
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,177
I would actually really
appreciate that right now.

1022
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:42,180
Drag it out
until the season's over.

1023
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:44,101
I don't care if you mess up
your relationship.

1024
00:48:44,102 --> 00:48:46,189
It wouldn't be the first time.

1025
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,907
But don't mess up this season.
We're too close.

1026
00:48:51,669 --> 00:48:54,196
Thank you, Uncle Pat,
for your kind words

1027
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,074
of comfort and support.

1028
00:48:57,075 --> 00:48:59,036
That's what uncles are for.

1029
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,211
- I wanted to...
- Jj-jj! Unh!

1030
00:49:11,212 --> 00:49:12,889
I haven't exactly figured...

1031
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,215
- Jess. Jess.
- What?

1032
00:49:15,216 --> 00:49:18,220
What is it exactly
that I'm looking at here?

1033
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,858
- Ah...
- [cell phone chimes]

1034
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:24,224
- Um...
- Mm.

1035
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:28,625
I, I, I haven't exactly
figured out

1036
00:49:28,626 --> 00:49:29,826
what I wanna say.

1037
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:32,236
- Well, that much is clear.
- But...

1038
00:49:32,237 --> 00:49:34,871
I promise you,
I am going to buckle down.

1039
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,793
I-I feel a breakthrough coming.

1040
00:49:36,794 --> 00:49:39,035
- Uh-huh? Really?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1041
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:41,243
- Oh, great. Wonderful.
- [cell phone chimes]

1042
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:44,244
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1043
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:48,044
You know, I saw a familiar face
puckering up

1044
00:49:48,045 --> 00:49:50,087
on the, uh, local news
this morning.

1045
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:52,256
[chuckles] I mean, you seem
to have become a big hit

1046
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:53,891
in this town.

1047
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:58,015
I'm not laughing.

1048
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:03,981
It is nothing, okay?
Really, Sonja, it's nothing.

1049
00:50:06,272 --> 00:50:10,271
Dating is not nothing for you,
Jess. It's a big deal.

1050
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:13,190
I-I'm aware of that.
And I'm proud of you.

1051
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:15,280
And that's your friend Sonja
talking. Hm?

1052
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:18,282
The gallery owner who has
invested a great deal of time

1053
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:20,717
and resources into you
is gonna talk now.

1054
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:24,283
I do not represent artists
who aren't focused,

1055
00:50:24,284 --> 00:50:26,290
who miss shows,
who don't take opportunities

1056
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:28,290
sitting right in front of them
seriously.

1057
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:32,297
- Are you dropping me right now?
- No! No, no, no!

1058
00:50:32,298 --> 00:50:34,971
Most certainly not.
Well, not right now anyway.

1059
00:50:34,972 --> 00:50:37,303
But, look,
I need you to know this.

1060
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:42,219
Your friend Sonja
will always be here. Understand?

1061
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,782
- Understood.
- Okay.

1062
00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:48,225
Yes, well, I-I-I-I... Yeah.

1063
00:50:48,226 --> 00:50:50,316
Well, I'll-I'll just leave you
to it. Yeah?

1064
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:53,111
Whatever that is.

1065
00:50:55,321 --> 00:50:56,874
[clears throat]
Hm.

1066
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,882
- Hello? It's fine.
- Hey. How's work?

1067
00:51:05,883 --> 00:51:07,330
[Danny] Uh, can I get you
anything? Uh...

1068
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:10,329
A coffee or a gingerbread latte
or something?

1069
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,329
No. Um, thanks, though.

1070
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:14,340
It would just be another way
to procrastinate.

1071
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:16,052
[Danny]<i>Oh. Got it. Okay.</i>
<i>Well...</i>

1072
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:17,814
I was just calling
to, uh, to see what time

1073
00:51:17,815 --> 00:51:19,776
you wanted me to pick you
up, the-the game starts at 7:00.

1074
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,342
<i>Didn't know if you wanted
to get dinner first...</i>

1075
00:51:21,343 --> 00:51:23,343
Oh, Danny.

1076
00:51:23,344 --> 00:51:26,943
I can't tonight.
I-I-I have so much work to do.

1077
00:51:26,944 --> 00:51:30,267
Oh, okay. Uh, okay. Thought we,
thought we had a plan.

1078
00:51:30,268 --> 00:51:32,069
[Jess]<i>I know, we did,</i>
<i>and I'm sorry.</i>

1079
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,751
But I just really, really need
to pull my show together.

1080
00:51:34,752 --> 00:51:36,357
Uh, are you sure, maybe just

1081
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:37,954
if you wanna come
for the third period?

1082
00:51:37,955 --> 00:51:39,363
<i>Just a little distraction
for you.</i>

1083
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:42,279
[chuckling] See?
Distraction is the problem.

1084
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,201
I can't go to every game. Okay?

1085
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:47,164
I can't... I can't take on
that kind of pressure.

1086
00:51:47,165 --> 00:51:50,247
Yeah, no, totally.
Um, I get that.

1087
00:51:50,248 --> 00:51:51,968
- I hope so.
- [Danny]<i>Okay.</i>

1088
00:51:51,969 --> 00:51:53,970
I'm so sorry.

1089
00:51:53,971 --> 00:51:55,293
[Jess]<i>Call me later.</i>

1090
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:05,262
- Hi. What's all this?
- Where's Jess?

1091
00:52:05,263 --> 00:52:07,393
- She's working.
- What? No!

1092
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:11,948
I told you about your shootout
costume-fitting at the party.

1093
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:14,191
At least I think I did. Did I?

1094
00:52:14,192 --> 00:52:16,402
- Uh...
- Arms out, please.

1095
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:18,195
We-we can reschedule with Jess.

1096
00:52:18,196 --> 00:52:19,402
There's still time
before the shootout.

1097
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:21,037
Where is she?
We'll just go to her next.

1098
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:22,799
- No, you will not.
- Danny-boy!

1099
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,881
- There is a schedule here.
- Well, what can I say?

1100
00:52:24,882 --> 00:52:27,410
She's busy.
We'll-we'll-we'll figure it out.

1101
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:31,288
You know, if your Aunt Laurie
and I had the opportunity

1102
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:34,417
to dress up like
big, kissing lips...

1103
00:52:35,213 --> 00:52:37,294

[cell phone chimes]

1105
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:42,339
You know, we went
as Barbra Streisand

1106
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,427
and Kris Kristofferson
for Halloween one year.

1107
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,429
What? Why are you
telling me this?

1108
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,947
I'm just saying. Got pretty
steamy when we got home.

1109
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:54,311
Your aunt looked pretty sexy
with that beard.

1110

[cell phone chimes]

1111
00:53:02,443 --> 00:53:05,001
- Oh, no.
- I can see it.

1112
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:07,884
I don't like it,
but, but I see it.

1113
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,367
Can't unsee it.

Hello? Oh. Danny.

1116
00:53:22,468 --> 00:53:25,902
Hey. Oh. I-I, I guess Pat did
tell you about the fitting.

1117
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,305
- You call this an emergency?
- Wait, what?

1118
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:30,474
Wait, I said I was
on a deadline. I'm painting.

1119
00:53:30,475 --> 00:53:32,472
- No, I-I thought you were.
- Well...

1120
00:53:32,473 --> 00:53:34,474
Wait, did you trick me
to get me here?

1121
00:53:34,475 --> 00:53:36,476
[Danny] Whoa! What? No...
W-what are you talking about?

1122
00:53:36,477 --> 00:53:39,478
Um, I... Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Please. Can you just...

1123
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:41,037
Yeah. Not-not right now.
Thank you.

1124
00:53:41,038 --> 00:53:43,481
Look, okay, Danny,
I'm sorry, but I, I can't.

1125
00:53:43,482 --> 00:53:45,962
I can't risk my career
over a superstition.

1126
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:48,365
I can't do the shootout,
I can't do the games.

1127
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:50,207
I'm not a mascot. I'm sorry.

1128
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,493
No, I-I get that. I-I'm sorry.

1129
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:55,052
Um, but I-I-I promise
that I didn't...

- Technically, uh...

1192

1193

1194
00:58:49,227 --> 00:58:50,791

1195
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:55,593

I'm really glad you told me.

1203
00:59:26,384 --> 00:59:29,306

- What?

1206
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:37,842
Look, I realize
it's not fair to you

1207
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:39,836
for me to pretend
like I'm single

1208
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:41,839

the first clue

from him.

1211

that's the honest truth of it.

1212
00:59:49,527 --> 00:59:52,851
But you don't have
to separate yourself.

She knows that I know, but
she doesn't know that I knew,

1220
01:00:36,903 --> 01:00:39,904

Yes, yesterday
I told you about Mark.

1243
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:03,380
I didn't tell you
about this place.

1244

No, but, um...

- What, you, like, looked it up?

That was
the worst year of my life. Uh...

1250
01:02:20,758 --> 01:02:22,005
When did you find out
about this?

1251
01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:24,003
How long have you known
about it, about Mark?

1252
01:02:24,004 --> 01:02:28,485
[sighs]
Uh, I knew, okay?

1253
01:02:28,486 --> 01:02:30,727
I got curious. I felt
that was a natural reaction.

1254

I, but I knew it wasn't my place
to bring it up.

1255

No, it wasn't. It wasn't your
place. This is not your place.

No, I know.
I know it's not my place.

1257
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,021
That's what I'm trying to say.

1258
01:02:37,022 --> 01:02:38,535
Let's see, what else?

1259
01:02:38,536 --> 01:02:40,021
What else
did you find out about?

1260
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,459
- Oh, the lakes, okay.
- No, Let's-let's not do this.

1261
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:45,542
- Um, his businesses.
- I tried to ask you about it.

1262
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:47,027
Get you to tell me
that you, you...

1263
01:02:47,028 --> 01:02:48,866

at all.

and you used it.

She's gone and I'm in here,

uh, four years ago,
and I gave it back to you.

1672
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:57,874
- Wait, wait. Shh.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

1673
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,956
[Danny] Don't tell me
what you want for Christmas.

1674
01:24:59,957 --> 01:25:01,367
I'm just gonna get you
another plaid shirt.

1675
01:25:01,368 --> 01:25:05,122
I know you don't need another...
What-what are you...

1676
01:25:05,123 --> 01:25:06,843
What's going on?
Why aren't you people drinking?

1677
01:25:06,844 --> 01:25:09,372
We all wanted to get you
something real special

1678
01:25:09,373 --> 01:25:11,928
for Christmas this year,
and, uh,

1679
01:25:11,929 --> 01:25:14,971
Jess came up
with a perfect idea.

1680
01:25:14,972 --> 01:25:16,853
I hope you like it.
Okay, everybody, ready?

1681
01:25:16,854 --> 01:25:19,257
One, two...

1682
01:25:20,057 --> 01:25:22,259
three!

1683
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,385
Oh, it's just a mock-up,
the real one is gonna be here

1684
01:25:24,386 --> 01:25:27,391
in a couple of weeks. Oh.

1685
01:25:27,392 --> 01:25:28,393
And these.

1686
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:32,829
[all] Merry Christmas, Danny!

1687
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:34,791
Oh, my gosh!

1688
01:25:34,792 --> 01:25:38,835
This is only the coolest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

1689
01:25:38,836 --> 01:25:41,079
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1690
01:25:41,879 --> 01:25:43,409
[both laughing]

1691
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:45,202
[all] Aww!

1692
01:25:45,203 --> 01:25:48,285
Yeah. Okay. Now we can drink!

1693
01:25:48,286 --> 01:25:51,415
- [all cheering]
- [Pat] Hurray! Yes!

1694
01:25:51,416 --> 01:25:53,412
[indistinct chatter]

1695
01:25:53,413 --> 01:25:55,892
[Pat] Belly-up.

1696
01:25:55,893 --> 01:25:58,418
All right, pour the whiskey
and shake 'em.

1697
01:26:03,861 --> 01:26:06,103
[man 1]<i>Stevo,</i>
<i>it's your day, baby. Whoo!</i>

1698
01:26:06,104 --> 01:26:08,305
<i>Look at him, that's some
lettuce right there, baby.</i>

1699
01:26:08,306 --> 01:26:10,347
<i>That's a salad
coming out of that helmet.</i>

1700
01:26:10,348 --> 01:26:13,270
<i>Oh! Oh! Great!
She wants to play six on four.</i>

1701
01:26:13,271 --> 01:26:15,031
<i>Awesome. Why don't you just
hand him the dummy?</i>

1702
01:26:15,032 --> 01:26:16,873
<i>Let's gift-wrap it.
Let's throw a party!</i>

1703
01:26:16,874 --> 01:26:18,436
<i>We'll have nice picnic basket,</i>

1704
01:26:18,437 --> 01:26:20,357
<i>we'll put the win
into a picnic basket,</i>

1705
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:22,159
<i>we'll get a blanket,
we'll go to a park...</i>

1706
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:25,446
<i>I'm gonna vomit. I'm gonna
vomit on these people.</i>

1707
01:26:25,447 --> 01:26:28,448
<i>This is like playing backgammon
with my sister's kids.</i>

1708
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:33,454
I will eat my foam finger for
an actual referee. Argh! Argh!

1709
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:35,455
[man 2]<i>I'd sell some of that</i>
<i>hair, but it looks too good.</i>

1710
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:37,174
[man chuckles]

1711
01:26:37,175 --> 01:26:39,462
<i>Hey, it really does.
I love the show here.</i>

1712
01:26:39,463 --> 01:26:41,464
<i>Great flow back here,
tell you what, I-I don't know</i>

1713
01:26:41,465 --> 01:26:43,461
<i>whether to watch the game
or, or this match.</i>

1714
01:26:43,462 --> 01:26:45,466
[men laughing]

1715
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:49,946
<i>What, what's the product
in there? Little Aqua Net?</i>

1716
01:26:49,947 --> 01:26:52,389
[man 1]<i>I know your grandma,</i>

1717
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:55,193
[indistinct yelling]

1718
01:26:56,114 --> 01:26:58,235
[man chuckling]

1719
01:26:58,236 --> 01:27:00,117
[woman]<i>This is gonna be</i>

1720
01:27:00,118 --> 01:27:02,482
[woman chuckles]

1721
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:05,487
