I  was studied psychology and
criminal psychology so I thought ...

47
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:25,502
what a amazing opportunity to
actually follow a team of ghost hunters ...

48
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,000

You know I'm not for a good time
you know, carrying the camera around.

51
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,400
Whether we really specific evidence
kind hard to say.

52
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,300
We get evidence, but really reliable
paranormal activity is hard to say.

put in you root chakras.

166
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,700
Your pocket is close enough.
It is right here, at about 2 inches.

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm not sure here.
- Okay.

168
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,500
Lena, come here.
- What is it?

169
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,700
My God, what is that?
- I do not know, it looks like ...

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,700
a shadow.

171
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:17,701
Hey guys, we have something up here.

172
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,700
Do you have something in the basement?
- No.

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come on, guys.

174
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,000
Look at there.
See that glow right there?

175
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,000
It like as a shadow person right
in there.Did you See that?

176
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,985
Yes.
- It's amazing.

177
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,100
Oh my God, I see it.
- That's pretty cool.

178
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,700
What ever it is ...

179
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,100
This may be evidence.

180
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
Who has the K2?
Do you have the K2?

181
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,040
Did you have the K2 here?
No one have the K2 here?

182
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,541
Why we don't have the K2 here?

183
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,300
He should always be manned.

184
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:00,700
We had a slamming door
blood and down.

185
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Guys.
- I know...I know

186
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,500
I watching the monitor,
I saw it. It's okay.

187
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I think we are cool.
- Paul, I give you the same.

188
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,600
Mike, keep doing what you doing.
keep on going

189
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,600
You guys will check whether there is a
defect is in this camera.

190
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,800
We go down and we look at it right now,
we find out for sure.

191
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,500
Stay here, guys.
- Lena, if you want to stay,
You can stay, Lena.

192
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,000
No, I gotta go.
- Stay here, we look at some readings.

193
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,600
Bring that K2 back up will ya.
- Okay. Jessus

194
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:04,400
so..I..you know..I'm thinking everybody
getting excited over nothing here.

195
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,365
Really I think this is very simply can
be explained because ...

196
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:13,500
The amount of light that comming thru
from the other room is ...

197
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,500
simply overdrive in the camera.
- No.. I think you're probably right.

198
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:20,180
The other's meaning too It.. I mean look out
..wash out, that's it could be anything.

199
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:26,899
Exactly, that's what I'm saying. What you guys
saw upstairs..in the monitor of the camera ...

200
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,800
is completely different from what I saw down here.

201
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,820
And I think that's it. I think it could
be explained by the light.

202
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:36,000
Could be right.We did get..
We did ...

203
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
When we were comming through the other room
came, we got ...

204
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,825
a really temperature change, but that
was in a completely different room..right

205
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,000
So ...
- So ...you know

206
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:46,500
in this particular case I think it is easy
enough to explain this phenomenon.

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,500
So you saying it's just a light bulb?

208
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I think so. I think it's worth to looking
into.

209
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,000
Was there a problem with the camera? or...
- Well ...

210
00:15:57,001 --> 00:16:00,000
What he thinking is he just saying
if the wattage was too high ...

211
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,500
the light is too bright.
These are infrared cameras.

212
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,500
All I know is that I felt something.
- I know.

213
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,000
You know I just think we go back through
and hit the process again ...

214
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,500
and hey, maybe we'll catch something.
That would be great.

215
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:20,500
Are you okay with that?
We look at it again?

216
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,100
God, I mean, it's your show.

217
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:26,200
I think we can
explain,this one.. you know?

218
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,100
Even if we don't debunk it
someone else will do it.

219
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,500
May be something going on,
but we got to explore every angle.

220
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,200
Absolutely.. Alright, that's we will do.
Excelent

221
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:45,000
In the land where lungs are not breathing,
Locilaf, take your son and go.

222
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:47,600
Find the clown that we seek ...

223
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,000
John Wayne Gacy Jr.,
who prayed on the meek.

224
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,000
Daniel, Randolph, Michael, Sam ...

225
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Find the clown we are seek ...

226
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:02,200
John Wayne Gacy Jr.,
who prayed on meek.

227
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
In the land where lungs are not breathing,
Locilaf, take your son and go.

228
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,200
Find the clown that we are seek ...

229
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,800
John Wayne Gacy Jr.,
who prayed on meek.

230
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,000
Daniel, Randolph, Michael, Sam ...

231
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,200
No, we did ..
- Guys ...

232
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,500
Everyone who helped us to
tonight, we thank you.

233
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:41,435
Just leave it.
- Yeah..I got it.

234
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:46,500
Leave it. Just go. You too, go.
- Come on, we go down.

235
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:51,000
I think the above is not fun anymore.
- Let's go.

236
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,800
Careful, it's dark.

237
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,330
I didn't turned the lights off.
did you turned the lights off?

238
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:58,000
No.
- Windshield.

239
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,800
Who turned the light out?

240
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:02,200
Lena, Franklin.

241
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,510
Be careful, watch your head man.

242
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:06,899
Watch out, your'e in my back
in my back

243
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,400
Careful.
- Lena, Franklin.

244
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,500
Give me some light, alright?
Jessus

245
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,800
Hey who turned the light out?

246
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,301
Get downstair, come on..come on

247
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,500
Okay, you're  get this stuff, right?

248
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
I have not again
imposed before I left.

249
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,400
No you didn't?
- Did you?

250
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,000
No, I didn't do it.
- Roby?

251
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,500
I bet it's Lou.

252
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,001
Getting the light

253
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:44,002
I mean..what..

254
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,000
It could be a spirit, it could be Gacy,
it could be Loki. I do not know.

255
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,500
My heart raising.
Is your heart raising right now?

256
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,500
With me everything is fine.
- My brain hard knocks.

257
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,800
This feels good, guys.
We have a great stuff.

258
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,700
We all get kick ass shits where
I'm standing..

259
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:09,000
There is no real evidence at this time ...

260
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,000
Any kind of supernatural happening here.

261
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm telling you, there is
something really bizzare going on here ...

262
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,100
and I'm stoked.

263
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,500
It is just getting ridiculous. Mike try to
freaks us all and makes us believe ...

264
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:24,300
that there is Gacy ghost bullshit..

265
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,900
I am a logical person and I was
think you have to be skeptical because ...

266
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,400
you had to explore every possibilities,
but I being ...

267
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,900
little bit worried that
maybe this is not a good idea.

268
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,000
There is noisey and creep sounds around the
house and everyone is going hysterical ...

269
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,500
this is not the way where I
I signup for.

270
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:47,500
We catch some great images in the film ...

271
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,720
as we now only those psychic
activity could film ...

272
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:56,100
We getting this evidence 
we getting some stuff and it's all contaminated ...

273
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,600
people getting scared and messy.

274
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,639
This investigation is gonna continues ...

275
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,500
and with any of luck, we gonna able to
put these rumors to rest...

276
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,400
Once and for all.

277
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,500
So where is the ...
- Come on, guys.

278
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,300
The K2 is down here.

279
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:33,000
Remember that and carry them in your pocket.

280
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,200
So where is this crawl space?

281
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Crawl space?
- Yeah.

282
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,200
Hot spot baby right there.
- Where?

283
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,410
Behind you.
- How far spot they go?

284
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,800
It goes very far underneath the house.

285
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,200
Hold on.
- Is that go through the whole house?

286
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,000
It goes through and under, I really
not know, we have not explored it yet.

287
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,800
Do you know anything?
- Nothing, nothing on this thing.

288
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,300
So..what are we looking at man?

289
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,700
We will ask a few questions,
because there is something going on.

290
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Yeah? Seriously?
- Seriously.

291
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,800
How does this all work?
- It's gonna work like this.

292
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Gacy, are you down here?

293
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,500
Gacy, are you with us?

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,500
John Wayne Gacy?

295
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If you are with us, make it noise
or move something.

296
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,900
Let us know you're present here.

297
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,800
Have you committed any crimes in this basement?

298
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Come on.

299
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Are there any dead boys in the crawl space?

300
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,500
John Wayne Gacy Jr. ...

301
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,000
are you here with us right now?

302
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,200
If you are here with us, say something.

303
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,000
If you're here with us make
something move.

304
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,500
Damn it, Gacy!

305
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,000
I think it ...
- How frank should I have to be with you?

306
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
To get personal?

307
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,100
Show your presence.

308
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,000
Are there any crimes committed in this basement?

309
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,300
Are there children buried in that crawl space?

310
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,400
So, Roby ...
- Yeap?

311
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,800
What do you think?

312
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
You know..I..
- I think we had to change all bulb

313
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
I really do.

314
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,700
I don't think we can take a chance ...

315
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I think the 'reading' is ...is
it's misleadings us.

316
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,801
Alright.

317
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:07,000
I think we got change our mind.
- Do you mind?

318
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:09,500
No..I go do sweet.
- I appreciate it.

319
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,800
That it's.

320
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,101
I start on the first floor.

321
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,500
What was that?

322
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,500
Gary?

323
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
Gary?

324
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,600
What a mess stuff.

325
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,500
Is anyone out here?

326
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Sure I left that open ...

327
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,500
I see a light bulb.
This bulb was fine.

328
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It is open.

329
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,000
Mike, you had opened the window?

330
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,800
What?

331
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,000
Let's see here ...

332
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
No!

333
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Roby, what's up man?

334
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,500
you jumpy don't you?
- Yeap,

335
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,902
Jumpy all the night?

336
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,580
Yeap.

337
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,200
How are you feeling?
- Just little bit shock dude.

338
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,800
Yeah, it hurts.

339
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:04,500
It hurt for just a second,
Get it going..get the blood flowing.

340
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:07,500
Yes, that's I was looking at.

341
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,500
Im sorry it nothing big. You can surely
stay tonight right?

342
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes.
- You can't be pussy about this thing.

343
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,500
Need a bandage?

344
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,000
Are you cool?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

345
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,500
Mike!

346
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I think I got something.

347
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,500
So Mike, let me show what I
did to you okay.

348
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,200
The audio feed that we recorded earlier
I have split in three base...

349
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,500
there split in three bandwidth
I could split it into more, but ...

350
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,500
I think you need to look at this.

351
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,500
Basiclly you can see here is nothing.
There is no damm thing there.

352
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,500
there is nothing. this is just noise, 
this is not significant at all

353
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Hang on just one second.

354
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Yeah.

355
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,600
I want you listen to this.

356
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,000
Put them on the speakers.

357
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,500
Ready?
- I'm ready.

358
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,500
Play that one more time.

359
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,000
Ready?
- Yeah I'm ready

360
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,700
It sounded like he said:
"Kick my ass."

361
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,700
Alright..Hey Guys, come here. Listen.
come here

362
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,500
Are you ready?
- Yeah we ready dude..just play

363
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,900
And what's is this start over here?

364
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,500
Is this nothing?

365
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,500
This is all noise, we can split
further...

366
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,300
This is from the cell.

367
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
It's awsome but it is not.

368
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:15,500
He is against our calling.
- he.s not gonna stop it.

369
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:18,800
Is it dangerous?

370
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,500
Yes, it is, because while I was down there...

371
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,000
I did two rooms cast's...

372
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
The first thing I asked ...

373
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,500
Is John Wayne Gacy Jr. Present?

374
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,200
What came out was:
"Sigel" ...

375
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,500
And it was pointing away from me,
it pointing towards him ...

376
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,100
or the presence and what it means is:
Ultimate power, Ego.

377
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,500
Then I cast again
and asked, "what's gonna happen to us now?

378
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,500
What should we do?

379
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,500
And came up, "Ryda" ...

380
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,000
Which combined with bad wounds means:
twist of faith.

381
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,500
"Bad path', do not move foward.

382
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
That is actually is an invitation
for us to stay.

383
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,500
No...no..no

384
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,200
I know what to do.
- Guys listen up real quick.

385
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:10,300
Guys..het...listen I'm in charge this operations 
and I telling to you

386
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,200
You guys are all paranoid.
Roby's on board.

387
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,800
I think we should focus all our energy
and our efforts on ...

388
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,000
in the cellar, in the basement
and crawl space.

389
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,500
This EPP ...
He is cannot harm us guys.

390
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,700
It's just a form an energy ...

391
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Hey Mike ...
there really is something crazy to hand down.

392
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm just saying ...
- That's why we 're here for.

393
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,400
We must not run away, we
can make good recordings.

394
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Everyone listen up.. hey..

395
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,326
Listen. real quick.
I'm in charge of this.

396
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,000
I want this to put together.
right,

397
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:51,000
We have only a few hours until daylight.
Is't right

398
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
We were getting close. almost over

399
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
We got some great shots.
We have the EPP right there...

400
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,500
"Kick my ass"
that's what he said ...

401
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,500
his last words were "kick my ass",
Before he was put to death.

402
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,500
So guys i think this is exciting.

403
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,900
This could make our career...

404
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We are this close.

405
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,800
I don't think we should walk away now,
but I think we should very.. very careful.

406
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't think normal people
see ghosts.

407
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,500
We stay here tonight.

408
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,800
John Wayne Gacy Jr. ...
Come with us tonight ..

409
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,000
"Nine" ... We will not
find you ...

410
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
"Two" ...

411
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,800
"Eight" ...

412
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,800
"Nine" ...

413
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,500
I'm not got anything ...

414
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,500
Nothing read about it or something?
- Nothing.

415
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,800
We will record anything
because he has not done anything here.

416
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,200
I do not think that something is.

417
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,000
Alright.

418
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:56,718
Guys, this is obviously not work with all
this stuff.

419
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:01,000
She has just pronounced a spell ...

420
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:06,500
and most of the people are here.

421
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,500
It's  all good.

422
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:25,500
You must climb higher.
- It's all right, do not worry.

423
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,500
She is as curious as I am.
- She is.

424
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,500
She sits in it.

425
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,100
Are we here?

426
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,500
No, when you're done then
we continue.

427
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Mike, let's let her down here.
She makes sure.

428
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,500
Give Gary your camera.

429
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,800
Should I stay here?
- Yes.

430
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,200
Is not that bad?
- Nope.

431
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,800
Really?

432
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:08,500
You are the only down here.

433
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,200
You two stay down here
with your camera ...

434
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,100
We go upstairs, just get everything
setup.

435
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,500
Do you have any questions?
- No, it's good.

436
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,500
I promise you that if
something happens ...

437
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,500
I got em..I got emm.
It'll be okay.

438
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:32,000
So everything is cool.
- Yes.

439
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,500
Alright, this, this..this ...

440
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,000
I think it that's pretty normal.

441
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,500
Not much activity here.
I cannot ...

442
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Damn.
- What is wrong?

443
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,300
This..the bedroom camera
I keep losing it, there got to be...

444
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,000
there got to be some kind of connection..
there got to be bad..i'm go out and check it

445
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,500
What, the upstairs bedroom?

446
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah, the same camera ..the same before.
In the same bedroom.

447
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,700
I'll take care.
I'll got it.

448
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
Thank you, Roby.

449
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,000
It got to be a bad connection.
Maybe the cables are bad.

450
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I'm sure the cables are bad, Franklin.
I'm all over that,

451
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,500
The rest looks pretty good.
We got pretty sharp here.

452
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,600
Locky, make me feel fear tonight.

453
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It not say which way we go.

454
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,100
Focus, okay?

455
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,200
I try it this way.

456
00:36:06,553 --> 00:36:10,812
Pure vanity, which spirit drive.

457
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:15,200
Clown, you're not alive.

458
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:19,200
"Locky", make me just here tonight.

459
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,500
the underworld returned him right.

460
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,500
I'm just not feeling anything.
- Focus, okay?

461
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
To be honest, I kind of lied before
when I said that this room is "charge".

462
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,000
That the energy of the 'Isa "was present.

463
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:48,200
Technically
straightline 'Isa'.

464
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,000
I am sorry.. ? I mean
I don't know.

465
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Maybe if I walk like Frankenstein..
you know..

466
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,000
And pretend I'm the monster.

467
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,200
If I am the monster, then
it all just work.. you know

468
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,100
Are you okay?

469
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Janina, hey..hey..hey..get up..come on
- Let me go.

470
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,500
What happened?
You felt something?

471
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,900
Come on..come on..come on

472
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,500
Let me know what happened.
Are you alright? jessus

473
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,800
Janina..hey..Are you okay?

474
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,100
What the matters?
- I don't know.

475
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
What is going on?
- She dropped.

476
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,500
Talk to me. Is that blood.
- Shut up.

477
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:40,500
Give her towell..something
give her something...go get towell

478
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
We're going to get help.

479
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,200
Oh my god
-I just did a spell ...

480
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,100
to banish him, not him
to call.

481
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
I disobey you, I'm sorry.

482
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,500
No, not..don't.

483
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,000
I guess he got bad.
- don't be sorry..don't be sorry

484
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
You got that, Franklin?

485
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:33,700
it's loose.
- That's weird.

486
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,800
Hey.

487
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,800
I just want to say sorry
for earlier ...

488
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,800
something just freaking
me out.. you know.

489
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,855
Alright..It's being a long evening.
- What are you doing?

490
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,500
I don't know about to do anything in this room,
It's kind freak me out.

491
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,000
It is the only room without a camera.

492
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,700
You know..You're kind an idiot but,
for some reason...

493
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,800
I know ..
It's what they say about I'm idiot.

494
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,800
What going on?
- Something very odds.

495
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
What happened in there?

496
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,900
I can honestly think ...

497
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,900
that the room exploded, everyone was shocked.

498
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,700
It's something you guys got
have a story ...

499
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,200
the ghostbuster, Casco.

500
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,200
You were still able to do.

501
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,300
oh..dude.

502
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,500
So, Tessa.

503

Okay, are you ready?

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,800

568
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,801

Mike?..Mike?

570
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,300

573
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,200
It's just sugar.

574
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,500
Why?
because this you can also find at the grocer.

575
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,800
Your blood pressure is very low.
- My blood pressure? - Yes.

576
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,400
What has happened there, Gary?

577
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,200
I do not know  man...

578
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,500
 I Just ... it just came out of 
nowhere, dude.

579
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,300
It hit me in the face.

580
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,400
I think you a little ...

581
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,800

582
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,500
You scratched me with your bat.

583
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,300
What are you talking about?

584
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:55,500
My back hurt really bad.

585
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,800
Let me take a look.

586
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,000
When did this happen?

587
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,400
I guess ... just upstair, I felling it.
It really hurt.

588
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,300
What is it?
What the hell..she got scratched?

589
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,800
You scratched me.
- No.

590
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,801
I did not scratched you. I can't scratched you
I do not know what you're talking about.

591
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,500
What happened?

592
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,800
If it you didn't, then who did?
- Come here.

593
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,200
Where were you?

594
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,400
It hurts.
- Turn around, let me see.

595
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,300
Let me see your nails, now.

596
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,301
Now.

597
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,200
Who was upstair with you guys?
- Nobody.

598
00:47:47,202 --> 00:47:49,500
And then I ran downstairs.

599
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,300
Turn towards me, honey.

600
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,800
Can we go home yet?
Is this proof?

601
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,200
Is this prove there is something in this house?

602
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,400
Can we go home now?

603
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Lena, show your back. - No, we cannot
go home. It's almost over.

604
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,500
Look at her back.

605
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,800
She gonna live.

606
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,000
Mike, here is the problem ...

607
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,400
the problem is not that there is a
demon scratched her back but ...

608
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,800
we are overly tired and we being doing this
far too long ...

609
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,700
and we have a good night's sleep.
- We are overly tired?

610
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,200
This happens because I'm overly tired?

611
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:18,500
No, I'm just saying ...

612
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,400
I just wanna go home.

613
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,900
Do We have enough proof yet.
I want to fucking go home.

614
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:29,200
Yes, but you need to calm down before you gonna
down the road.I cannot let you drive like this.

615
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,800
Somebody just grab me.

616
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,200
Nothing grab you.
There is nothing in here.

617
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,000
I just not fall by my own, okay?

618
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,200
It's okay.
- I'm going out.

619
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:48,500
I really not appreciate
what ever your people do ...

620
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
but I'm going home. Now.
- Lena.

621
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,000
Document everything.

622
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
Lena, wait it up.

623
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:06,200
No, I can not do this anymore, okay?

624
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,000
We need to go...
we need to go

625
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,200
I know...
I know

626
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,000
I know, something is going on.
I know

627
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:15,500
I hear it, okay?

628
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,804
Can we go?
- I know that is weird

629
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,300
We can just take the van..you and me
We just take the van, we can leave

630
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,500
We cannot leave anyone here.
We cannot do it okay? Alright

631
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,500
You can just stay outside.
Just relax a while.

632
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,800
Say it to me that you're ready
to go.

633
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,300
What?
- Please.

634
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:42,500
Listen, hold on we just need
calm down for a just a momment, okay?

635
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,500
Think rationally about this.

636
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:48,000
Janina said you were scratched by demon

637
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:52,000
We were out of the house for a second.
Breathe that good fresh air.

638
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,550
And I dont think you were not
scratched by a demon.

639
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,800
Just me. I know something
going on tonight ...

640
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,800
I do not know what it is, but I
want to stay to find out.

641
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,800
And you didn't think it is the demons ...
but what about that chair?

642
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,797
I do not know. I'm saying..I feel like we are
all tired and something weird is going on.

643
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:14,798
okay?

644
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,701
Okay..But I think the thing best to do is
stay with it to see what it is.

645
00:50:20,702 --> 00:50:21,702
Alright?

646
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,200
I can't go back in there.

647
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,000
I just can't.
I do not know what is in there, but ...

648
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,800
You do not have to come back, alright?
I want you chill out in the truck ...

649
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,500
while we sort out this matters.

650
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,500
We seen..we seen some very strange phenomena.

651
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,000
That is the only word that I have for
right now.

652
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,600
We catch the best footages.
I think ...

653
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,601
if we just get that appreciation...

654
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,900
I think may be this is what we came for.
Is this not what we wanted?

655
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,200
I mean Lena is just left this place ...

656
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,028
and I have no conclude how she got that
scratches on her back.

657
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:20,000
It seams we having some unexplainable
phenomena happening.

658
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,300
I dont know.. I don't think this is something
that we have to mess with.

659
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,500
I do not know..I do not know
what is going on.

660
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:50,300
Yeah, this is a strange phenomenon.
here we go.

661
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,900
What is this?

662
00:52:05,201 --> 00:52:07,700
Are you sure you got shot Roby?

663
00:52:07,801 --> 00:52:09,200
Yes.
- What is this?

664
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't know.

665
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,800
Is this ectoplasm?

666
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,800
That is polar.

667
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,100
This is almost the same, right?

668
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:25,800
Is it here when you were ...

669
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,500
I didn't seen it.
- It's always been here.

670
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:30,800
That? That is it always been here?

671
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,800
See?

672
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,268
This is the area Mike said
that he got the strongest reading from.

673
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,500
That's what we have to look out ...

674
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,324
I do not know what happen down there.
This is just before the camera went out.

675
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,000
Something hit that camera, you see?

676
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,900
This is what I'm talking about...

677
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,500
The stuff is just keeps going down.

678
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
We got to get this stuff running
or we are not gonna able to find anything.

679
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,000
Gary, do me a favor.
go down there ...

680
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:03,800
Pull the cable off this camera ...

681
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:07,200
because we know that these were working
before this camera fell over.

682
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,201
And pull those cables and bring in up here ...

683
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,831
let's switch out this, that is the only
I can think up to do.

684
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:15,140
We got the stuff to running up or we are dead
we dead, I mean it.

685
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,700
Are you kidding me?
Are you serious?

686
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,200
Do you want me to go downstairs?

687
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:25,945
It takes you only 20 seconds that it's. 
straight down bring..pull the camera, 

688
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:26,946
pull them right of it from
the camera and bring them up

689
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,600
Franklin, I have experienced all this shit
tonight.

690
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,000
Can I relaxs?

691
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,000
You're the only person I can trust
to do this right now.

692
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,001
You're the only one I got.

693
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,300
Alright..I feel so much better now that
I'm no longer in that house.

694
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I couldn't take it anymore ...

695
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,000
I don't know if anything I
saw or felt was real, but ...

696
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,246
I can acctualy really breathe
outside of that house.

697
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000

698
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,300

What is going on up here?
-What is happening?

739
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,300
There was someone or something in the basement.
- Okay.

740
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,000
Listen..god damn it.. listen to me.

741
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:12,400
Somebody in the basement, right?

742
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,400
It flew through through it.

743
01:00:15,401 --> 01:00:18,800
It flew right through it.
I ran upstair as fast as I could.

744
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,700
And then..and then every singgle
door slamed.

745
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:26,200
Look at me..Your high energy making

01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,300

749
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:40,700
Okay, can we please

01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,700
What the fuck?

752
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:52,294
Stay calm and quiet.
It's just a fuse.

753
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,400
Calm? What are you talking about dude?
You're the one who freaking out.

Come on
- Calm down now.

755
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,100
It is a fuse.

756
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,700
It is not a fuse.
There is more going on tonight.

757
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:09,500

759
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,800

- In old houses, this happens quite often.

760
01:01:19,925 --> 01:01:22,801
Everything will be fine.

761
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,200

776
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,900

You know the camera was crash, it was down there.

01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:15,200
And... I looked up and something whiss

01:03:15,201 --> 01:03:18,200
So there is something whiss across the room?
No, I ran up the stairs ...

798
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,500
I am sick and tired Mike.

799
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,901
It's been a long trip, man.

800
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:25,327
Yes, one more night before we
call it a set ...

801
01:04:25,627 --> 01:04:28,092
Just one night with these guys here.

802
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,101
Where the hell is the fuse box,
did you see anything?

803
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:38,500
No.

804
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,400
I wonder what he
made so scared.

805
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,401
The windows are left open,
it is an old house.

806
01:04:45,501 --> 01:04:47,501
Watch your head

807
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,105
I mean something scare gary.

808
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,778
There are some interesting
temperature change, we got that.

809
01:04:58,078 --> 01:05:01,568
There must be a wire run,
follow the wire, did you see anything?

810
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,000
Let's go check over..,
up there again

811
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,000
We have some stuff earlier.
We just need get out the data ...

812
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,800
take it back, and analyz it.

813
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,703
I mean Something happens, it's interesting,
but I do not know what it is.

814
01:05:19,803 --> 01:05:21,703
And we have it or heaven't.

815
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,000
The fuse box is right here.

816
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,220
Here, you can get up here.
- Let's see what is up there.

817
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,906
I was pretty sure that the
activity start at this area.

818
01:05:48,006 --> 01:05:50,006
But there is little.

819
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,000
I do not know why the fuse box is not
in the second floor.

820
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,335
Hey.. I tell you what,
these houses are crazy.

821
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,000
Look at that

822
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,800
Alright, I got it.

823
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,800
I mean, I grew up in the house like this.

824
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,320
But In these old houses,
it's blow all of the times

825
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Same thing like those gusts,
big house, drafty...

826
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Alright, we good?

827
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,540
I'll go look ...

828
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,601
Yeap.

829
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:41,300
That it's?
- We are good.

830
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,100
Michael?
Michael, take a look at that.

831
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,500
What do you think of that?
This is what we got on a video

832
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,000
Do you believe me now?
Mike, look at that.

833
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,000
I am looking at it.

834
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,300
You know it could be a moth or ...

835
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
Are you retarded ...

836
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,200
Mike, you are retarded ..

837
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,000
No, it just could be anything ...

838
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,200
something getting in the way of light.

839
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,600
Right, it's certainly not deformative.

840
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,900
The video that we
have is not deformative.

841
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,700
I think we need to go on.
- No, I agree ...

842
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,370
I think we should once,
swept this place, okay?

843
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,400
Let's make another sweeps
 through the entire house.

844
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,400
Someone need to go the attic first of all.

845
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,650
Is there anybody already been
I don't think so.

846
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,600
I think we're done.

847

One more sweep for the entire house, that's it.
-fine, fine, fine

868
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,100
I understand that you have been scared
- It's okay, it's okay ...

869
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,300
We're done.

870
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:46,929
Some things that we
have seen here, ...

871
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:52,100
I do not know,
it is positively disturbing ...

872
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:57,900
I'm now trying very..very hard to keep
good attitude...

873
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:00,900
keep a scientific mind,

874
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,100
We have seen somethings, 
somethings that I really ...

875
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:06,750
I can tell you I'm lost to explain.

876
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:11,970
I do not know, I do not know what the fuck
to believe what is real and what is bullshit.

877
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,250
There are weired things,
maybe Micheal is right ...

878
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:22,600
this spook like in investigation,
stuff maybe it's real.

879
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,450
I do not know what the fuck,
to expect anymore...

880
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:33,416
This is a really good a bunch of people
I'm working on this...

881
01:09:33,512 --> 01:09:39,066
with me here,I really feel bad if 
something would happen to them.

882
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,400
This does not feel good, I don't know.
Something is weird.

883
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,200
I don't know, I don't want it anymore.
I don't give a shit about ghosts.

884
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,000
I do not care for this stupid trip.

885
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,215
I promise..I will never..never again to
do anything like this on the weekend.

886
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,500

889
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,700

891
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,500
Ghosts or no ghosts,

896
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,800
As the professor says,
Document everything, alright.

897
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,045
The word of the craziest.
- Yes, I don't know.

898
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,384
Can we make this fast?
- Hurry up.

899
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:21,500
Here you go.
- Can you stop complaining?

900
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,649
Can I stop complaining?

901
01:11:23,749 --> 01:11:26,600
Like you've been here with this fucking shit.

902
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:31,875
Shut up, yes.
So we all go home, Gary.

903
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,300
I'm lighting a candle,
okay, what I'm doing here is ...

904
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:24,150
Okay, guys, I've set all this stuff.
- When did you do setup this stuff?

905
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,700
and get to started.

906
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,101
I just finished with engraving his name
in the candle ...

907
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:29,600
Have you purchased over the Internet?

908
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:34,900
Yes, I did and I keep it in my mojo bag
I have several bones ...

909
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,500
This is fucking joke, stay calm.

910
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,150
What I doing here is fireing wall of
protection, spell ...

911
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,800
because his spirits can follow us.

912
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,200
Even when we are gone from this house ...

913
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,850
So we need to protect ourself against him.
This is his candle ...

914
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:32,000
We don't have black candle,
so I wrapped with black tape.

915
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,100
How to ...

916
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,620
His name is in paper nine times

917
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
You know ...

918
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:49,100
note to myself,
do not hire physics ever again.

919
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,600
Hello?

920
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:55,600
No...no...no

921
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,155
I think I'm going to quit.

922
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,350
Okay, I'm get myself outta here.

923
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:16,700
I think it's might be a good time
to go pack this things...

924
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,050
and may be even consider 
comming back in diffrent time.

925
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:24,850
I think that's I'm gonna do. I think that's a
 decision I made now.. I  think I may go ahead

926
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:28,300
We gonna pack it, let's give this shit down

927
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:30,390
I will let this shit down.

928
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,685
Concentrate on your root chakra ...

929
01:15:32,785 --> 01:15:35,901
that is the chakra at the
base of your spine.

930
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:39,231
Your feet are connected to this wood,
and remember ...

931
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,735
This wood is charged with energy ...

932
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,300
feel the energy of your body
flows into this wood.

933
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,800
You gonna push..push..push
through your root chakra.

934
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,043
You gonna say:

935
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:59,600
"Let his evil self,
be his own undoing. "

936
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:03,095
"Let his evil self,
be his own undoing. "

937
01:16:03,296 --> 01:16:04,796
Tessa.

938
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,800
"Let his evil self,
be his own undoing. "

939
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:14,400
"Let his evil self,
be his own undoing. "

940
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:27,697
"Let his evil self,
be his own undoing. "

941
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,515
Janina, Janina.
What are you doing?

942
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:42,100
Janina, what happens?

943
01:17:33,222 --> 01:17:44,800

be his own undoing. "
