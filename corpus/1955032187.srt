the crazy thing.</i>

<i>Invisibility is everywhere.</i>

3
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:24,052
<i>I mean, sure, people tend to
focus on the things we can see.</i>

4
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:27,513
<i>Like matter, living things.</i>

5
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:30,516
<i>But there's also all this stuff
that we can't see.</i>

6
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:33,519
<i>Like sound waves or gasses.</i>

7
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:35,356
<i> And a few things we miss</i>

8
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:37,522
<i> because they're hidden
in plain sight.</i>

9
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:42,527
<i>Like I said,
invisibility is all around us.</i>

10
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:46,532
<i> Even in the most obvious
and familiar places.</i>

11
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:50,535
<i> These opposites exist
side by side.</i>

12
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:54,249
<i> The seen...</i>

13
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:55,667

- ( music stops )
- Mr. Perkins.

35
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:09,613
Fancy seeing you here.

36
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,615
Well, I really hope
you were meditating

37
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,744
on the marvels of science
and not rocking out

38
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,619
to Fitz and the Tantrums again.

39
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,622
Oh, well, actually
it is The Hives today,

40
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,624
in honor
of those skinny jeans

41
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:23,627
you are only slightly too old
to pull off.

42
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,631
GIRL: Ah, look at that.

43
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:32,636
Not so fast.

44
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:35,639
Yeah, I got your pitch
for the semester project.

45
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,642
Really? Turning a papaya
into a battery?

46
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:41,645
I've already got seven other
kids turning vegetables
into batteries.

47
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,647
In my defense,
papaya's a fruit.

48
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:47,650
Mm. Well, your proposal
is officially rejected.

49
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,653
( scoffs )
George gets all A's

50
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:51,781
and you're letting him study
how a guinea pig reacts

51
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,656
to an all-ice cream diet.

52
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:55,658
- It gives them terrible gas.
- Yeah, thanks, George.

53
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,661
Make sure you put that
in your report, okay?

54
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:58,661
(guinea pig passes gas )

55
00:02:58,661 --> 00:02:59,663
That's it, Mr. Whiskers,

56
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,664
no more Rocky Road for you.

57
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:04,667
I want to see you challenge
yourself. Do something relevant.

58
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,380
Maybe something to do
with transformation.

59
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,674
This is the same matter
in two distinct forms.

60
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,676
One state is dense, dull--

61
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,677
Much like this conversation.

62
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:17,680
The other is transparent.

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,101
Brilliant. I'm assigning you
a new experiment.

64
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,686
Figure out what that
substance is,

65
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:25,688
then transform it
into its crystal state.

66
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,691
And how am I supposed
to do that?

67
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,692
Build a homemade
spectrometer.

68
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,694
Yeah. You're gonna have
to do this little thing

69
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:34,696
we in the science community
like call science.

70
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,699
You think The Hives
became The Hives

71
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,120
by shutting out the world
and listening to their
headphones all day?

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,704
No. They got out there.

73
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:44,707
All right, my point is you never
know what you can accomplish

74
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:47,709
unless you engage the world
a little bit.

75
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:50,712
And as an added incentive,

76
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:53,675
I've decided as of right now,

77
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:55,677
this is worth
half your class grade.

78
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:57,720
- What?
- Mm-hmm. Check out
whatever gear you need.

79
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
You've got till Monday.

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,723
( scoffs )

81
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:07,729
He wants me to make mystery gunk
into a crystal.

82
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,731
That's impossible.

83
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:11,733
It's not technically impossible.

84
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,736
It's not like
"time-travel impossible,"

85
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:15,737
or "speed-of-light
impossible".

86
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:17,739
It's just... hard.

87
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,576
George, why are you
wearing clown pants?

88
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,743
These are
vintage lounge slacks.

89
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:23,288
They're all the rage
in Budapest,

90
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,040
which is the new Paris,
by the way.

91
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,748
Girls dig these pants.

92
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:29,751
At least six girls
have noticed them.

93
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:30,878
Okay. One girl noticed them.

94
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:34,715
And that girl was you.
Just now.

95
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,762
( indistinct chatter )

96
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:44,766
Whoa!
Nice vampire outfit, freakshow.

97
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:47,061
But Halloween's
not till tomorrow.

98
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:50,315
Really? "Vampire outfit?"
Is that all you got?

99
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:53,317
Is it because of my cape
and my pointy teeth?

100
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:55,736
Code red, code red!

101
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:57,613
C-Dog approaching.
11 o'clock. Be cool!

102
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:58,905
- What?
- Hey, Cleo!

103
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:03,784
Carter, my man.
What's the ups?

104
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,787
Lay the good news on me.

105
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,795
- How's it going?
- Good.

106
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:16,797
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to study together

107
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:19,800
- for Perkins' next quiz?
- BOY: Who is that?

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,929
- ALL: ( laugh )
- No idea.

109
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:28,809
Yeah! Yeah, totally.
We could be a cliché, how fun.

110
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,646
I'm sorry, cliché?

111
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:34,233
The sports guy, asking the nerdy
girl for help with his homework.

112
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,818
No. I just thought we could,
you know, join forces.

113
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,824
Uh... okay. I'm going to be in
the lab for study hall tomorrow.

114
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:48,829
If you have a change of heart,
stop by.

115
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,833
Your epic crush
just asked you out on a date,

116
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,835
and you shut him down.

117
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:56,837
That wasn't a date, George.

118
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:59,840
That was just a crafty jock
trying to weasel his way

119
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,843
out of doing any actual
thinking. No thanks.

120
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:05,846
I'll leave the mindless flirting
to my sister.

121
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:07,848
"Awesome city! So the bomb!"

122
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:10,851
MOLLY: Cleo!

123
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,854
Speak of the devil.

124
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:16,856
Hello, car full
of beautiful women.

125
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:19,859
School's done.
You know what that means.

126
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,862
Fro-yo. YOLO.
Oh, no. Let's go! Yeah!

127
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,864
ALL: ( whooping )

128
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:27,577
- You wanna come with?
- Yes!

129
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:28,868
No, thanks. I'll pass.

130
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:29,869
Darn.

131
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,871
Come on.

132
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,873
It'll be awesome city,
totally the bomb.

133
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:36,001
( scoffs )
Thanks, I'll pass.

134
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:39,879
It's Thursday! They're gonna
have salted caramel!

135
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,881
Come on! Yeah.
Your buddy can come too.

136
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:46,886
This is George, Coug.
You've met him 400 times.

137
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:49,890
Sorry, small dude. My bad!

138
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,310
Still a pass.

139
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:56,896
Catch you later then, sis.

140
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:00,900
- GIRL: All right, let's go!
- ALL: ( whooping )

141
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,902
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.

142
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,903
I've got
the big scooter today.

143
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,905
I made a few modifications
to it.

144
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:08,909
Really souped it up.

145
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:15,914
All right! Give The Coug a paw!

146
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:17,209
( chuckles )

147
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,918
Aw, yes!

148
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,919
( trolley bell dings )

149
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:28,927
( scooter engine sputters )

150
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,932
( backfiring )

151
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,935
( engine dies )

152
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,937
( engine grinding )

153
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:47,946
- MAN: Honey!
- WOMAN: Yes?

154
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:48,948
MAN: Did you pack my charger?!

155
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,948
It's in your dopp kit.

156
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,951
And I printed
the boarding passes.

157
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,953
MAN: ( laughs )
There it is!

158
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:56,955
- It was in my dopp kit!
- WOMAN: Yeah.

159
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,956
( pulls zipper )

160
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,959
Do they even know you're
here yet?

161
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,961
Give them a second.

162
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,964
Oh. Hi. We were afraid we were
going to miss you.

163
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:08,967
- Hey, George.
- Hey, Cleo's Dad.

164
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:10,804
I'm gonna get Whiskers
all settled in.

165
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:11,969
I'll see you inside.

166
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:13,972
Okay, remember,
set the alarm on at night.

167
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:16,975
Don't touch the thermostats.
And there are protein shakes
if you run out of food.

168
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:19,977
Honey, I am so sorry we're gonna
miss the big lacrosse game.

169
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,980
No worries, Dad.
There'll be others.

170
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,399
But the first game always
sets the tone for the season.

171
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,983
- The college scouts
will be there.
- Ohh!

172
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:28,986
- Just remember,
keep that stick up.
- Stay loose.

173
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,988
Keep that middle line open and
cross if they double team you.

174
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,990
- ( playful growl )
- BOTH: ( chuckle )

175
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,993
And you...

176
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:38,996
Stay loose, you know,
with your studies and stuff.

177
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll be sure to do
some rigorous stretching

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,002
before I tackle my homework.

179
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:48,005
- MOM: Okay.
- Okay. Bring it in, team.

180
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,006
- One, two, three, family!
- ALL: Family!

181
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,007
MOM: ( whoops ) Bye, girls.

182
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:54,010
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.

183
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:58,015
- CLEO: Bye!
- MOLLY: Bye, guys!

184
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:04,021
Oh, I forgot to mention,

185
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,023
I'm having some people
over for dinner tonight.

186
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:10,026
Molly, you can't. I have to
focus on my science project.

187
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,738
Who's coming over?

188
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:14,031
Just a few girls from
the lacrosse team.

189
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:17,035
The whole team.
And their boyfriends.

190
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:20,036
And anybody else
who wanted to come.

191
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,041
( sighs )

192
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:29,045
- ( loud music )
- ( excited chatter )

193
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:31,047
ALL: ( chanting)
Hoo! Hoo! Sad but true!

194
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,049
The Fightin' Owls
are hunting for you!

195
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,344
Does anyone know
what goes in meatballs?

196
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:39,055
- Meat, babe.
- Huh.

197
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:41,057
( playful screams )

198
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:48,064
( squeaks )

199
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:50,066
( muffled music thumping )

200
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:57,073
( computer beeps )

201
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:58,200
( scoffs ) This is hopeless.

202
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,077
I can't even get light
to pass through it.

203
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:02,077
Did you try diluting it?

204
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:04,080
- Yes.
- ( splashing in pool )

205
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,084
I can't believe I've been exiled
out of my own house.

206
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:12,087
I don't think you were exiled
so much as "gently displaced."

207
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:15,050
You know what I suggest?

208
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,093
A break. We head inside,
sample some meatballs,

209
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:21,096
see if maybe one
of your sister's teammates

210
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:23,098
has a penchant for shorter,
less athletic,

211
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:26,101
but very intelligent, men.

212
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,063
You should go, George.

213
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:30,106
Go get some food.
I'll still be working.

214
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:33,108
You're a good person.

215
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:35,111
( passes gas )

216
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,120
( up-temp pop song plays )

217
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,124
♪ Trick or treat
Feeling kinda creepy ♪

218
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:52,128
I don't mean to brag, but I'm
a bit of an athlete myself.

219
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:55,549
I was one of the top
lawn bowlers at math camp
last summer.

220
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:58,677
You know they call lawn bowling
the "gentleman's polo".

221
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:00,261
- I like horses.
- Me too!

222
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:03,138
I love horses!
Love them!

223
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:06,267
What are your thoughts
on guinea pigs?

224
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:10,144
CLEO: Let's see what happens
if I turn up the heat.

225
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,106
( typing on keyboard )

226
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,149
( computer beeps )

227
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,151
Now we're getting somewhere.

228
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:18,152
Sucrose.

229
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,280
<i>How sweet of  Señor  Perkins.</i>

230
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,157
He gave me sugar.
( chuckles )

231
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:26,160
Shoo! Get out of here.

232
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:51,728
Ahh!

233
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:55,024
Ahh! Oh!

234
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,197
( grunts )

235
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,202
Uh...

236
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:10,203
Move!

237
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:12,749
Damn! ( panting )

238
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,168
( grunts )

239
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,335
( alarm beeping )

240
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:19,213
Had a little oven-temperature
misfire, but all good now!

241
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,222
CLEO: Coming through!

242
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,224
Excuse me
for just one second.

243
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:34,227
Hey, what's going on?

244
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:37,230
George, I made a moth disappear!

245
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:40,233
Ooh! Ooh!

246
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,362
- What?!
- I know this sounds impossible,
but it's true.

247
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,244
I don't see it!
Where is it?

248
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:53,246
- Do you see that?
- Uh... not really.

249
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:56,249
Thanks for coming, guys.
Get some rest.

250
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,252
We have a big day
tomorrow.

251
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,254
No!

252
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:04,257
No, no, no!

253
00:13:05,258 --> 00:13:07,259
No!

254
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:14,267
( panting )

255
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,277
Bye, guys.

256
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:33,287
On the bright side,
the lacrosse girls dug me.

257
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,288
I got a bunch of digits.

258
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:37,289
You got no digits.

259
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,291
I got no digits.

260
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,293
But I did enter my number

261
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:43,295
into Nikki's phone
while she wasn't looking.

262
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,297
That's something.

263
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,299
BOTH: ( chuckle )

264
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:49,301
I made a moth invisible.

265
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:52,304
You believe me, right?

266
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:55,307
I believe... you probably
should get to sleep.

267
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:57,436
I'll see you tomorrow.

268
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:16,387
Ugh.

269
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:53,423
( alarm beeping )

270
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,484
Ahhhh!

271
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:56,485
Molly?

272
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:59,488
Molly, are you okay?

273
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:01,490
MOLLY: Where am I?!

274
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,492
Uh, you're in the bathroom.

275
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:06,495
MOLLY: No, I'm not. I'm gone.

276
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:08,497
What do you mean, you're gone?

277
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:19,508
Um... Molly?

278
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,509
- Molly, where did you go--
- MOLLY: Exactly!

279
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,930
- ( startled gasp )
- MOLLY: Where did I go?
I don't know!

280
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,514
I don't know where I went!

281
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,519
- Cleo!
- Ahh!

282
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,063
I'm not in the toilet!

283
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,522
( whimpering )

284
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:36,525
MOLLY: This is just a bad dream.

285
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,237
Wake up, Molly! Wake up!

286
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,824
Okay. There.

287
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:46,661
Now, I'm going to
remove this towel

288
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:51,539
and be awake and everything
will be totally normal.

289
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,541
MOLLY: Ahhhh!

290
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,543
Ahhh!

291
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:04,552
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help!

292
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,554
And what are you
going to tell them, Molly?

293
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:08,556
I don't know!
That I've disappeared?

294
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,559
I'm invisible?
I can't see myself?

295
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,561
( sighs ) You're right.

296
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,563
They're gonna think
I'm a crazy person.

297
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,565
Okay. This is going
to sound insane,

298
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:19,567
but I think my experiment
spread to you.

299
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,568
What are you talking about?!

300
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,571
I made a moth invisible
last night.

301
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:26,573
- You what?!
- I was working
on a sugar solution

302
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,576
and then I just spilled a bunch
of chemicals into the mixture

303
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,580
and then a moth flew
through steam and it
became invisible.

304
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,583
Did it land on you or touch
or did you swallow it?

305
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:39,880
You're asking me if I swallowed
an invisible moth?

306
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,591
Actually, there was something.

307
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:46,594
Something in the bathroom
in my water.

308
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,595
It was really weird.

309
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,891
It was sorta bug-like. Gross.

310
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:54,602
The bathroom window was open?

311
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:56,603
Yeah. I think so.

312
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,607
Okay, so what if the moth was
attracted to the light

313
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,610
and then it flew into the room
and then fell into your water?

314
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,612
Where I accidentally drank it?

315
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:09,158
Are you kidding me?!
I accidentally drank your
invisible science project moth

316
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:11,618
- and now I'm invisible too?!
- ( knocking )

317
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,619
THE COUG: Hello?

318
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,624
Happy Halloween, everyone!

319
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,626
- ( stomach growls )
- Oh, man!

320
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,629
Yo, next time The Coug says he's
gonna eat 26 meatballs,

321
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,631
you tell him
that's too many meatballs.

322
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,632
Oh, no. Your boyfriend's here.

323
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,635
Oh. Hey, Cleo.

324
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:32,639
Hi, Coug.
You're... a bear.

325
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,640
Sure am. Didn't Molly tell you?

326
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,937
We're all going as a big
Wizard of Oz team costume.

327
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:39,645
I'm the Cowardly Bear.

328
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,648
- It's a lion.
- What's a lion?

329
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,650
The Cowardly...? Never mind.

330
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,194
Uh, is Molly ready to roll?

331
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:46,653
Um, no, she is sick.

332
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,365
And she's in the bathroom.

333
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:49,656
And you can't see her.

334
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,658
Oh, no. Was it the meatballs?

335
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,661
Molls? Babe?
Are you okay?

336
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,662
MOLLY: ( muffled )
Oh, not really.

337
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,664
Cleo's right.
I'm really sick.

338
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,667
You're our Dorothy!
Let me take a look at you--

339
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:05,671
No! I'm very contagious!
Nobody can see me.

340
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,798
Literally.

341
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,968
Go, Coug.
Save yourself.

342
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:10,676
Quick! Go!

343
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,803
- Quick!
- ( gasps )

344
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:13,679
- Bye!
- Bye.

345
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,681
- I guess.
- Bye.

346
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,977
( exhales )

347
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,688
Wow, Molly,
your boyfriend.

348
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,691
Two words:
"Cowardly Bear."

349
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,694
MOLLY: ( sighs ) Can we maybe
not mock my boyfriend right now

350
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,696
and instead focus
on the crisis at hand?

351
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,533
Okay. You're invisible.

352
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,701
How and why are you invisible?

353
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,702
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

354
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,704
If it spread
through your body this fast,

355
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,707
it's extremely soluble.

356
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,251
It should only take a few hours.

357
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:45,253
A few hours?!

358
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:47,712
I think. I hope.

359
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:49,715
Okay, listen, Molly,
I have to get to school

360
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,717
and figure this whole thing out.

361
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,678
And what am I supposed to do?

362
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:55,720
Just lay low. Call in sick.

363
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,723
I can't!
I can't miss school today!

364
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:02,562
Wait. It's Halloween.

365
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:16,033
Really, Molly? I think your
friends can survive Halloween

366
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,742
without Dorothy.

367
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:20,745
You don't understand. Today is
the first game of the season.

368
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:23,748
If I don't go to all my classes,
I can't play.

369
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,750
This is what you're
concerned about, lacrosse?

370
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,753
College scouts
will be at that game.

371
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:32,592
This is my only chance
for them to see me.

372
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,758
And my teammates
are counting on me.

373
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:37,472
I can't let them down.

374
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:38,763
I can work with this.

375
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,766
Maybe with a little make-up
and some gloves.

376
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:48,772
Cleo!

377
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,776
The invisibility must... spread.

378
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:55,739
So I anything that I touch will
gradually become invisible too?!

379
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:56,781
I don't know, Molly.
Yes?

380
00:21:56,781 --> 00:22:01,785
So there's absolutely no way
I can un-invisible myself?

381
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:11,338
- I have an idea.
- What?

382
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:17,801
Yup. We're the same height,
we sound the same,

383
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,929
we'd have the same skin tone
if you ever learn to moisturize.

384
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,807
This could totally work.

385
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,646
This is insane.

386
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:32,816
There is no way I'm going to
pull off pretending to be you.

387
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:34,817
I'll be there coaching you.

388
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:37,820
( scoffs ) Come on, Molly. Even
with the hair and the makeup,

389
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,824
I'm still me.

390
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:50,543
A mask, really?
Dorothy didn't wear a mask.

391
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:53,546
We're in New Orleans. Just say
you're Mardi Gras Dorothy.

392
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:54,838
Mardi Gras Dorothy?

393
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:57,841
Yeah. From a big
Munchkin Town parade float,

394
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,843
with Munchkins
giving beads and stuff.

395
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:04,140
Look, I've gotta
go to school today.

396
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,849
So you've gotta get me
through this.

397
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:07,850
Get your science gear

398
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,854
and do whatever it is you
need to do to figure this out.

399
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:13,274
Just please help me
get through my day

400
00:23:13,274 --> 00:23:15,276
until I can
be seen again, okay?

401
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,987
Besides, you look totally cute.

402
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:21,864
- Fine. Give me your car keys.
- What?

403
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:23,866
Molly, you're invisible.
You can't drive.

404
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:27,870
Well, you can't drive either.
You don't have a license!

405
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:36,879
( car engine starts )

406
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:42,010
This is crazy.
What if we get pulled over?
How do we explain this?

407
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,887
MOLLY: Relax.
It's going to be fine.

408
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:49,892
Sorry. Just talking
to my invisible sister.

409
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:53,730
She's a really amazing driver.

410
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:58,900
MOLLY: See? She probably thought

411
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,904
this was one of those
self-driving cars.

412
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:04,906
( boat blows horn )

413
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:06,908
( up-tempo pop song )

414
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:11,913
♪ If you could see
inside of me ♪

415
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:19,921
♪ Everything that I could be ♪

416
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,923
♪ Yeah ♪

417
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:23,925
This is never going to work.

418
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:26,928
Dorothy should've made
better life choices.

419
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:28,930
"Oh, there's a tornado coming.

420
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,933
I'm gonna go
put on my party clothes."

421
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,935
Come on, you'll be fine.

422
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:36,063
( grunts )

423
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:42,943
Don't walk like you.
Walk like me. Stand up straight.

424
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:45,946
Look more cheerful. Wave.

425
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:49,951
- GIRL 1: Hi, molly.
- GIRL 2: Hey, Molly.

426
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:51,953
- GIRL 3: Hey, Molly.
- MOLLY: See?

427
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:53,954
- This is totally working.
- GROUP: Hi, Molly!

428
00:24:53,954 --> 00:24:57,959
Okay, here's the real test. If
Nikki buys this, everyone will.

429
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,961
Okay, act natural.

430
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:02,964
But... act like me.

431
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:06,384
Act like natural me.

432
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:08,512
Molly?

433
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:09,970
Yes.

434
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:14,975
Oh, Molls! I'm so glad you're
here! I thought you were sick.

435
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,977
Uh, yeah,

436
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:18,814
- I am still very sick.
- Oh.

437
00:25:18,814 --> 00:25:20,399
But I'm a bit better

438
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,983
and I'm still quite pale
and my voice is a bit different.

439
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:24,985
But, you know, Nikki,
it's okay.

440
00:25:24,985 --> 00:25:26,530
Awesome city, right?

441
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,988
I love the mask.

442
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:29,115
The mask. Uh, right.

443
00:25:29,115 --> 00:25:30,991
Well, I am
Mardi Gras Dorothy.

444
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:32,993
Hmm, cute.

445
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:34,995
Molls, I'm totally freaking out.

446
00:25:34,995 --> 00:25:36,997
Arianna Burmeister is
also out sick,

447
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:39,834
so that means
I'm totally in charge
of Romp the Swamp tonight.

448
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,003
And I don't know what to do or
if we have enough decorations.

449
00:25:42,003 --> 00:25:45,005
Please, just tell me
everything's gonna be okay.

450
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:47,007
That actually
sounds awful Nikki,

451
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,009
but I would just cancel.

452
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:51,010
- ( gasps )
- Are you okay?

453
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,013
Uh, I am fine. I just have a
little neck twitch this morning,

454
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,015
- but it is okay.
- (laughs softly )

455
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:59,018
Molls, you're here.
But I thought you were sick.

456
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:02,021
- She got better.
- Hey, that's great!

457
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:04,023
- Give the Coug some sugar.
- No. No, that is eww.

458
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:07,026
Um, I am very contagious.
So I will see you around. Bye.

459
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:09,322
Molls?
Did I do something wrong?

460
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:14,034
Um, no, no.
It's-It's my disease.

461
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:20,039
( cell phone rings )

462
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:23,042
Hey, George.

463
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:24,043
<i> GEORGE: You're not at school?</i>

464
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:26,756
No. I'm-I'm really sick.

465
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:28,047
Your sister's here.

466
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:32,051
She's like some freaky carnival
milkmaid Zorro.

467
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:33,052
Hey, Molly!

468
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:38,600
Uh, yeah. Yep.
She is Mardi Gras Dorothy.

469
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,060
She looks totally smokin'.

470
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,062
What? Eww. ( scoffs )

471
00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:46,064
George, can you please
just cover for me today
in Perkins' class?

472
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,067
You got it.

473
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:51,069
CLEO: All right, Molly, we have
to go get to the lab.

474
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,072
No. First period is starting.

475
00:26:53,072 --> 00:26:55,074
I can't be late.

476
00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:58,495
And what class is it, Molly?
Intro to Conformity?

477
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:02,791
Intro to Geometry, room 42.
Come on.

478
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,088
C-minus?

479
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:17,095
Molly, if you needed help
with line segments,
you could've just asked.

480
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:20,098
Right, because
you're always so...

481
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:23,395
warm and supportive.

482
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,107
Okay. I have to go
get to study hall

483
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,109
so I can get a big
compound microscope

484
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,111
so I can figure
this whole thing out.

485
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,113
Actually,
I'll grab it for you.

486
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,115
You have to get
to Pep Circle.

487
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:39,117
Pep what?

488
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,119
( awkward laugh )

489
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,121
BOTH: (laugh softly)

490
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,124
That was weird.

491
00:27:45,124 --> 00:27:47,125
A thing we do on game days.

492
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,127
Just bonding and trust-building.

493
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,128
It's a pre-game ritual...

494
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,550
that you are leading.

495
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,134
- ( applause )
- (cheers )

496
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,136
ALL: ( chanting ) Trust!
Teamwork! Fellowship! Pride!

497
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:02,139
A team united can't be denied!
Whoo!

498
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,142
Who puts the pep
in Pep Circle?

499
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,144
ALL: We do!

500
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,144
Please don't make me do this.

501
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,147
Molly! You made it!

502
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,149
ALL: Molly!

503
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,150
I've warmed us up. We're totally
ready for you to take over.

504
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,153
Oh, well, that's just great.

505
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,157
Um, so let's just go straight
into the first thing then

506
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:23,160
- which is the...
- Group hug!

507
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,162
Or we can skip the first thing!
Okay...

508
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,707
Oh. Oh. ( grunts )

509
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,165
Next thing on the agenda.

510
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,168
The circle of trust.

511
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,169
Right.

512
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,172
So let's circle up
and do some trust.

513
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,468
NIKKI: You can have the bunny.

514
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,177
The bunny?

515
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,179
The bunny of truth.

516
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,181
Well, the bunny of truth.

517
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:48,185
Um, Nikki, could you
please remind us all

518
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,187
what the rules are
of truth bunnying?

519
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,189
Whoever holds the bunny
gets to safely say

520
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:56,193
something true and meaningful to
clear the air before the game.

521
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,195
( soft laugh )

522
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,197
Well, then Nikki
should start us off.

523
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,198
Oh, okay.

524
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,200
Um...

525
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,203
Okay, I'm so grateful
to be on a team with all of you.

526
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:11,208
If I am strong, it's only
because I'm surrounded
by such strong women.

527
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,209
And I'm especially grateful
for Molls.

528
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:17,214
She's always there. No matter
how crazy my life gets,

529
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,216
she gives me the friendship
and support I need.

530
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:23,054
She's an amazing friend
and captain.

531
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,221
- ALL: Yeah!
- Thank you.

532
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,641
I also want to say one more
quick bunny truth,

533
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:31,227
and that is that
I'm really mad at the people
who invented weather apps

534
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,229
because don't you wanna wake up
every morning

535
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,232
and be surprised
at what the weather is?!

536
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,235
ALL: ( laugh ) Yeah.

537
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,236
Your turn.

538
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,240
Well, my truth is

539
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,241
that I am so grateful
to be sitting down

540
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:50,246
because this dress
is a serious chaffing hazard.

541
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,247
ALL: ( murmur )

542
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:56,252
Okay. Now for your...
emotional truth.

543
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:03,259
My emotional truth. That would
probably have to be that

544
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,262
I am fine. I am great.

545
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,264
Thank you, Nikki.

546
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,267
Molly, this is your safe place.

547
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,268
You can trust us.
We love you.

548
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:16,271
ALL: ( agreeing )

549
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:33,288
My truth would be...

550
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,294
I'm not the girl that

551
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,296
everybody thinks I am.

552
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:45,135
I'm not
the beautiful shining star

553
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,303
that everybody suspects.

554
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:55,310
I'm actually more of the person

555
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,313
that nobody notices,

556
00:30:58,313 --> 00:31:00,315
or nobody pays attention to.

557
00:31:02,316 --> 00:31:03,318
But...

558
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:09,324
this is probably why
I'm so uncomfortable here.

559
00:31:09,324 --> 00:31:11,326
( uncomfortable laugh )

560
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:13,621
But, guys,

561
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,331
this is- this is all in my head.

562
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:18,332
Right?
Because I'm awesome city Molly.

563
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:21,295
I mean, the bomb.

564
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,337
Anyway, that's my truth,

565
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:28,342
which is actually,
weirdly, true.

566
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:33,348
( indistinct chatter )

567
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:35,309
( door opens )

568
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:40,354
I think that deserves
another group hug!

569
00:31:40,354 --> 00:31:42,356
Um, okay.

570
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:45,359
All right. Yep, yep.
Love you too, okay.

571
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:48,363
( squeaks, then passes gas )

572
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:02,375
GEORGE: Carter. My hombre.

573
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,378
- How's the guinea pig?
- Still farting like a chainsaw.

574
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:07,090
I can't figure out why.

575
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,383
Because there's talmitic acid
in the ice cream.

576
00:32:09,383 --> 00:32:11,677
It's reacting with ascorbic acid
and turning it into a fat.

577
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:14,388
Ascorbyl palmitate. They can't
metabolize the fat,

578
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:18,351
- so you end up
with the flatulence.
- How'd you know that?

579
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:20,394
I was a Governor's Scholar
in Chemistry last year.

580
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:22,396
GEORGE: Really? A Governor's
Scholar in Chemistry?

581
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:26,399
- That's, like, crazy amazing.
- How about
we keep it between us?

582
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,401
You know, it's not
really something
I like to advertise.

583
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:30,404
Hey. Do you know if Cleo was
planning on showing up?

584
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:34,242
I'm sorry, man.
She's actually sick today.

585
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:37,410
But I know she might've
maybe wanted to be here, maybe.

586
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:44,417
Can I ask you something?
What's Cleo's deal?

587
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,420
Whenever I talk to her,
it's like,

588
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,965
you know...
and she's kind of...

589
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,429
Never mind. It's cool. Uh,
good luck with the guinea pig.

590
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:27,460
( indistinct chatter and sighs )

591
00:33:30,463 --> 00:33:33,466
This is actually amazing.

592
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:35,303
Oh! Okay!

593
00:33:35,303 --> 00:33:37,469
- Gotta go, guys. Bye.
- GIRL: Molly?

594
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:39,471
ALL: ( murmuring )

595
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:42,893
What are you doing?
Did you get the microscope?

596
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:45,477
Forget about that!
Some really cute guy

597
00:33:45,477 --> 00:33:46,479
in the science lab
was asking for you!

598
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,480
Oh, that's just Carter.

599
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,194
"Just Carter?" He's super cute
and totally into you!

600
00:33:53,194 --> 00:33:56,488
No, Molly.

601
00:33:56,488 --> 00:33:58,909
I'm not the kind of girl that...

602
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:02,493
guys like Carter
are ever actually into.

603
00:34:03,495 --> 00:34:04,496
Come on.

604
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:06,498
There's only one way
to find out.

605
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:08,500
No. Don't you think
we have bigger things

606
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,045
to worry about right now?

607
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:12,504
I'm not going
to go meet Carter, okay?

608
00:34:12,504 --> 00:34:13,504
That's final.
Now if you'll excuse me,

609
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:16,508
I have
a massage circle to lead.

610
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:20,512
Aah! Meatballs! Meatballs!

611
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:22,514
- ( stomach gurgles loudly )
- Ohh, coming through!

612
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:25,517
Coming through!

613
00:34:30,522 --> 00:34:33,485
Coming through! Mayday!
Meatballs!

614
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,362
- ( gurgling continues )
- Lots of meatballs!

615
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:39,531
( grunting ) Why did I eat
so many meatballs?!

616
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,829
Watch my fur, dudes.

617
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,538
( stall door shuts )

618
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,543
( exhales )

619
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:53,544
Here goes nothing.

620
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:56,547
You can do this, Molly.

621
00:34:56,547 --> 00:35:00,551
Just hold your breath,
get in and get out.

622
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:02,552
Gross.

623
00:35:02,552 --> 00:35:04,555
Uh... is there a chick in here?

624
00:35:04,555 --> 00:35:09,560
MOLLY: ( deep voice ) No.
It's me, a dude.

625
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,397
In the stall.
Doing my dude things.

626
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:15,400
- Mmm.
- ( door closes )

627
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:21,114
- MOLLY: Carter!
- Uh, yes?

628
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:23,573
It's me! Cleo!

629
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:24,993
- Sorry, who? You're--
- I'm Cleo!

630
00:35:24,993 --> 00:35:28,997
- Cleo! You showed?
- Yep! Sure did!

631
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:33,584
- I thought you were---
- MOLLY: Sick? Yes. I was.

632
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:35,878
But now I'm
feeling much better.

633
00:35:35,878 --> 00:35:39,589
And you're in costume.
You hate costumes.

634
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:43,593
Yeah, I know,
but I'm working
on this thing

635
00:35:43,593 --> 00:35:47,597
where I'm trying to relax more
and be less judgmental
and uptight.

636
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:49,434
GEORGE: Are you sure
you're okay?

637
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:50,600
You don't really
seem like yourself.

638
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,602
Those pants
look ridiculous on you.

639
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:55,315
There's the Cleo
I know and love.

640
00:35:55,315 --> 00:36:00,610
So, hi. We're hanging out.

641
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,612
Yeah, I guess we are.

642
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:04,614
This is great.
I'm really psyched.

643
00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:07,617
- You are?
- I know.

644
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:09,619
I've probably been
confusing in the past.

645
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:12,622
A little grouchy, right?
Mean, even.

646
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:14,624
But let's just
put all that behind us.

647
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:17,627
Focus on the now.
Maybe get to know each other.

648
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,629
Tell me about yourself.

649
00:36:19,629 --> 00:36:22,632
What kind of stuff
does Carter groove to?

650
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,634
( gasps ) Oh, no.

651
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:28,638
Oh. Uh...
Actually, I have to run.

652
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:33,185
But maybe we could
go out sometime,
like in a non-study setting.

653
00:36:33,185 --> 00:36:34,643
Like a real date.

654
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:36,646
Wait a second, I--

655
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:39,648
I'm not sure I'm hearing you
correctly in that suit.

656
00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:40,649
Are you asking me out?

657
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,652
Yeah. I am.
What? Is that weird?

658
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:46,656
Honestly, coming from you,
a little.

659
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:49,659
- A lot, actually.
- What are you doing tonight?

660
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:52,661
Tonight? Um, I'm volunteering
at the school fundraiser.

661
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:55,664
Romp the Swamp? That's
my favorite event of the year!

662
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:58,667
I'll see you there tonight.
It's a date.

663
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:05,674
- BOTH: ( grunt )
- Coug!
Watch where you're going!

664
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:08,220
It's not The Coug!

665
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:11,680
Molly? What are you doing?

666
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,683
So, you didn't miss your study
date with Carter after all.

667
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:16,978
- What?
- I figured out a way
to pretend to be you.

668
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,688
- You what?!
- Yeah.

669
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:21,689
The bear costume
was thick enough,
so it didn't turn invisible.

670
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,692
Well, at least,
not right away.

671
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,694
Anyways,
I got you a real date.

672
00:37:25,694 --> 00:37:28,239
He's working
at Romp the Swamp tonight.

673
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,697
At least,
I think it's a date.

674
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,995
Honestly, it was
a little hard to communicate,

675
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:35,704
being in the bear suit.

676
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:41,710
Oh my!
Bear. With no head.

677
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,254
- Headless bear.
- Oh, no.

678
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:44,712
Molly? What's happening?

679
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,715
I'm Cleo.

680
00:37:46,715 --> 00:37:47,715
No. You're Molly.

681
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:48,716
No. That's Molly.

682
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:51,137
No. That's a headless bear.

683
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:53,681
Or an armless bear?

684
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:54,723
Torso-less bear?

685
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:57,726
Okay, I'm kind of
losing my mind right now.

686
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:00,020
George, calm down.

687
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,273
Remember how I made a moth
invisible last night?

688
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:04,733
- Yeah.
- CLEO: Well, it flew
into Molly's drink

689
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:08,571
and now she's invisible.

690
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:10,738
- Say something.
- MOLLY: Hi, George.

691
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:12,740
How are you?

692
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,868
Fine. Are you okay, Molly?

693
00:38:14,868 --> 00:38:16,744
MOLLY: I'm good.

694
00:38:17,746 --> 00:38:20,748
This is amazing.

695
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:21,748
And very scary.

696
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:23,751
THE COUG: Who stole
my bear costume?

697
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,045
MOLLY: Oh, gotta hide!

698
00:38:26,753 --> 00:38:29,756
Molly! Wow, you are
a sight for sore eyes.

699
00:38:29,756 --> 00:38:32,595
- Oh, hey, little guy.
- George.

700
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:35,763
Of course.
Someone stole my bear costume.

701
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:38,601
Just right out of the bathroom.
Any of you guys seen it?

702
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:40,767
Um, no. Nope, Coug.
I haven't seen a thing.

703
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:43,771
But it was so great
talking to you. Awesome city.

704
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:45,772
Um, I have to leave.

705
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,774
( stammers )

706
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:56,783
So do you think, in exchange for
me being cool and keeping all
this a secret,

707
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:58,785
you might put in a good word
for me with your friend Nikki?

708
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:02,332
MOLLY: You like Nikki?!
That's so adorable!

709
00:39:02,332 --> 00:39:04,791
Nikki's a sweetheart.
She likes nice guys.

710
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,504
Just be yourself around her.

711
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:10,757
Yeah, I find the whole
"being myself" approach

712
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:11,798
never really works out for me.

713
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:14,801
Just give her a chance.
She might surprise you.

714
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:21,807
Molly Eastman?

715
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:26,647
- Yep, that's me.
- Yeah, I'm Mr. Perkins.

716
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:27,814
Your sister's
in my science class.

717
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:30,817
Oh. Well, I have
heard a lot about you.

718
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:33,112
Uh, can I talk to you
for a minute?

719
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:34,820
Sure.

720
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,242
Yeah, uh, listen, I know your
sister stayed home sick today.

721
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:41,828
Yeah, she's really,
really sick, Mr. Perkins.

722
00:39:41,828 --> 00:39:44,831
- She has to stay home.
- Yeah. The, uh, thing is,

723
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:47,833
I went all angry teacher
on her yesterday

724
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,836
and I told her, well,
she'd fail my class

725
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:51,837
if she didn't deliver
on her science project.

726
00:39:51,837 --> 00:39:54,841
I just want to make sure
that she's okay.

727
00:39:54,841 --> 00:39:57,844
That the science project isn't
the reason she's staying home.

728
00:39:58,844 --> 00:40:00,846
She's okay. Yeah.

729
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:03,975
She is actually doing a lot more
than you expected.

730
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:05,852
A lot more.

731
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:07,853
I'm pretty sure she's gonna
blow you mind.

732
00:40:07,853 --> 00:40:09,855
Okay, that is great to hear.
See, I knew she had it in her.

733
00:40:09,855 --> 00:40:12,858
- Thanks.
- Your sister is one of
the brightest kids

734
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:15,987
that's ever sat in my class.
She's got this potential
inside her.

735
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:19,865
You know, I think she could do
great things in this world
if she wanted to.

736
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:22,868
If she would just get out
of her own way.

737
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,871
Yeah.

738
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:28,874
Um, if she were here,

739
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:31,877
she would want me
to tell you that

740
00:40:31,877 --> 00:40:34,879
She really doesn't want
to disappoint you.

741
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:37,882
Well,
tell her to feel better.

742
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:39,884
It was good
talking to you.

743
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:46,892
Come on.

744
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:53,898
- ( gasps ) Yes!
- ( bell rings )

745
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:56,901
- ( up-tempo pop song plays )
- ( excited chatter )

746
00:41:00,615 --> 00:41:03,908
MOLLY: Cleo, shouldn't I
have at least started
turning visible by now?

747
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,911
CLEO: ( sighs ) Yes.

748
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:07,913
Which is exactly why
we need to go home

749
00:41:07,913 --> 00:41:09,915
so we can figure
this whole thing out.

750
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:13,918
MOLLY: Wait.
We're not going home now.

751
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:15,920
But school's over.

752
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,922
MOLLY: And the most important
part of the day is starting.

753
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:19,924
- Which is?
- MOLLY: Lacrosse.

754
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:22,927
Making me visible
is gonna have to wait.

755
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,929
I... ( groans )

756
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:27,932
<i>- ALL: ( cheering )
- MALE ANNOUNCER:
All right, everyone.</i>

757
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:29,933
<i>Five minutes until game time.</i>

758
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:31,937
<i>Don't forget to buy your
Go Fighting Owls T-shirts.</i>

759
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:33,938
I think I'm gonna
sit this one out.

760
00:41:33,938 --> 00:41:35,940
- I don't think so.
- Molly, I cannot do this.

761
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,941
I am going
to get creamed out there.

762
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:38,943
You'll be fine.

763
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,944
That's easy
for you to say.

764
00:41:40,944 --> 00:41:42,946
What? You think
this is easy for me?

765
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:44,950
I'm terrified every game.

766
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,951
I can hardly sleep
the night before.

767
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:49,954
I have to drink ginger fizz
just to untie the knots
in my stomach.

768
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:52,957
Well, then why do you do it?

769
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:56,960
Well...
I like being on a team.

770
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,964
When everyone's around me,
my nerves settle.
I don't feel alone.

771
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:05,094
It's like, when I'm part of
something bigger than myself,

772
00:42:05,094 --> 00:42:08,682
- it makes me better.
- Hmm.

773
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:17,981
Hey. You can do this.

774
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:20,984
I'll be there with you,
telling you exactly what to do.

775
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:23,987
( panting ) You ready to rumble,
Molls?

776
00:42:23,987 --> 00:42:24,988
We've gotta rock it,
today.

777
00:42:24,988 --> 00:42:26,408
Uh, yeah, rock it!

778
00:42:26,408 --> 00:42:27,992
Totally.

779
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:29,992
Okay, bring it in! Bring it in!

780
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:30,995
WOMAN: Bring it in, ladies!

781
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:33,997
All right, everyone.
Go Fighting Owls!

00:42:33,997 --> 00:42:35,999

00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:40,004
<i> Okay, high school sports fans.</i>

785
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:43,005
<i>It's the moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

786
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:45,008
<i> It's game time!</i>

787
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:49,011
ALL: ( chanting ) Owls!
Owls! Owls! Owls!

788
00:42:50,014 --> 00:42:52,015
MOLLY: Your stick's upside down.

789
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:54,016
Duly noted.

790
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:02,024
Molly, move up!

791
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:05,571
You're running the wrong way!

792
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,031
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on!

793
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:10,032
Yes!

794
00:43:15,037 --> 00:43:17,039

ALL: ( groan )

00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:33,055
<i>Wow, slow and painful start
for the Fighting Owls.</i>

797
00:43:33,055 --> 00:43:35,058
<i> - Let's see
if they can recover.
- It's okay, it's okay.</i>

798
00:43:35,058 --> 00:43:38,059
Should somebody
call an ambulance?

799
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:42,064
( panting ) You okay?

800
00:43:42,064 --> 00:43:46,067
That hurt more than anything
in my entire life has hurt.

801
00:43:46,067 --> 00:43:50,072
- All right, come on. Get up.
- Sure, just let me try
and start breathing first.

802
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:55,077
Molly, what's wrong
with you? It's like you've never
held a stick before!

803
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:57,078
Uh, it must just be my cold.

804
00:43:57,078 --> 00:43:59,080
( coughs )

805
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,042
Hey, listen to me.

806
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,377
This is my whole life, here.

807
00:44:02,377 --> 00:44:05,086
Those college scouts are
my future. I can't lose today.

( up-tempo pop song plays )

809
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:11,093
I've got an idea.

Thanks.

840
00:46:15,214 --> 00:46:18,217
You know, there's some
really complicated physics
in lacrosse.

841
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:21,220
I'm available for
a one-on-one consultation
anytime.

I can't play.
I just can't.

I can't even feel
my legs.

all or nothing.

This is my future, Cleo.

851
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:52,252

Okay, bye.

Okay, guys, I know
you are exhausted.

856
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:08,102
I'm exhausted
and in pain.

857
00:47:08,102 --> 00:47:09,268
A lot of pain.

858
00:47:09,268 --> 00:47:11,270

of pain.</i>

( laughter )

860
00:47:12,271 --> 00:47:16,275
But there is this thing
I always say,

861
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:19,277
which is when you're part
of something

862
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:22,281
bigger than yourself,
it makes you better.

863
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:24,826
That's what
a team means.

864
00:47:24,826 --> 00:47:28,705
So let's get out there
and have each others'
backs, okay?

865
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:30,581
ALL: Yeah!

866
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,290
You guys,
we can do this.

867
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,292
- Right?
- ALL: Yeah!

868
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,294
All right, all in.

869
00:47:36,294 --> 00:47:39,297
- One, two, three...
- ALL: Owls!

870
00:47:41,299 --> 00:47:43,301
Nice job.

871
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:45,303
I don't know how
you do this every week.

872
00:47:47,305 --> 00:47:50,308
<i>ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
What an absolute classic.</i>

873
00:47:50,308 --> 00:47:52,436
<i> We're all tied up,
30 seconds left.</i>

874
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,311
<i> Time for one more play.</i>

875
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:56,023
CROWD: Owls! Owls! Owls...

876
00:48:07,324 --> 00:48:09,327
<i>ANNOUNCER:
What a pass by the Owls!</i>

877
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:12,329
I can't get to the goal, Cleo.
It's all you, you got this.

878
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:13,330
Go, Molly!

879
00:48:20,337 --> 00:48:23,341
CROWD: Molly! Molly! Molly...

880
00:48:26,343 --> 00:48:29,346
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Molly Eastman is now
one on one with the keeper.</i>

881
00:48:55,372 --> 00:48:56,666
( whistle blows )

882
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,375
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Goal!</i>

883
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,378
<i>-  Molly Eastwood scores!
-  She did it!</i>

884
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:03,672
<i>ANNOUNCER:
And the Fighting Owls win 8-7!</i>

885
00:49:03,672 --> 00:49:06,383
You did it!

886
00:49:06,383 --> 00:49:09,386
( all cheering )

887
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:15,391
CROWD:
Molly! Molly! Molly...

888
00:49:32,408 --> 00:49:33,410
CLEO:
Hold the slide steady
so I can figure out

889
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,411
what's going on
with your cells.

890
00:49:38,414 --> 00:49:43,712
Okay, getting focused here.

891
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:45,421
There's a nuclear membrane.

892
00:49:45,421 --> 00:49:48,424
- Wait.
- MOLLY: Wait what?

893
00:49:48,424 --> 00:49:50,426
Is that a good wait
or a bad wait?

894
00:49:50,426 --> 00:49:51,427
Your body, your cells,

895
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:53,555
they aren't metabolizing
the compound.

896
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:55,431
That sounds like
a bad wait.

897
00:49:55,431 --> 00:49:57,432
Why is this even happening?

898
00:49:57,432 --> 00:49:59,435
The original sugar
solution

899
00:49:59,435 --> 00:50:00,979
must be turning
into a fat

900
00:50:00,979 --> 00:50:01,981
and getting stuck
in her cells.

901
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:03,439
So what does that mean?

902
00:50:03,439 --> 00:50:05,440
We have to figure out how
to neutralize the solution

903
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,442
before her body could
fully absorb it, or--

904
00:50:07,442 --> 00:50:09,863
Or the invisibility will
become permanent.

905
00:50:09,863 --> 00:50:12,448
What?

906
00:50:12,448 --> 00:50:14,450
I thought you said
this was temporary.

907
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,453
It takes the human body
24 hours to fully digest
something.

908
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:18,453
Right.

909
00:50:18,453 --> 00:50:19,455
Okay, so when did you
swallow the moth?

910
00:50:19,455 --> 00:50:21,456
Last night at midnight.

911
00:50:21,456 --> 00:50:24,459
GEORGE: That means we have
until midnight to find
an antidote.

912
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:26,461
Or she becomes
invisible forever.

913
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:28,463
But where do we start?

914
00:50:28,463 --> 00:50:30,466
I don't even remember
what I spilled

915
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:31,466
into the last solution.

916
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:33,469
So that's what
we do first.

917
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:35,470
We redo your experiment.

918
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,472
Someplace where we can
fully analyze it.

919
00:50:37,472 --> 00:50:38,599
A real lab.

920
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:40,475
Like the one at school.

921
00:50:40,475 --> 00:50:43,188
Okay, we'll start with
a basic sugar solution

922
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:45,480
and keep adding chemicals
until we get the right
combination.

923
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,024
Exactly. We'll know
we got it right

924
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:48,483
when the moth vanishes.

925
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:50,195
We'll catch a moth.
You head to school

926
00:50:50,195 --> 00:50:51,486
and start setting up
the lab.

927
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:54,488
Go, Fighting Owls!

928
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:57,491
Yeah, this probably wasn't
the right context for that.

929
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:04,499
MOLLY:
Where are we going
to find a moth before midnight?

930
00:51:04,499 --> 00:51:07,501
CLEO:
Come on.
I know the perfect place.

931
00:51:09,504 --> 00:51:12,507
Cool. A cemetery
on Halloween!

932
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:14,509
Great.

933
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:16,510
The key to catching
a moth

934
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,514
is to be
in the darkest place...

935
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:21,515
( strikes match )

936
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:23,517
...with the brightest light.

937
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:34,528
Moth...

938
00:51:38,533 --> 00:51:39,533
CLEO:
This is crazy.

939
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:42,536
Where are all the moths?

940
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:44,538
MOLLY:
Here, mothy.

941
00:51:44,538 --> 00:51:46,540
Here, mothy mothy mothy.

942
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,542
CLEO:
They're not cats, Molly.

943
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:50,086
MOLLY:
Whatever.

944
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:53,507
Cleo?

945
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:56,550
It's no big deal, moths.

946
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,552
Must have just been
the wind.

947
00:51:58,552 --> 00:52:00,554
I can get this back on
in no time.

948
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,561
Cleo!

949
00:52:13,566 --> 00:52:15,403
Can you see me?

950
00:52:15,403 --> 00:52:18,531
Yeah. It's nice to
almost see your face again.

951
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:19,573
Am I getting better?

952
00:52:21,574 --> 00:52:23,703
No, you're not.

953
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:27,582
It's just the night mist
glistening in the moonlight.

954
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:30,584
I'm scared, Cleo.

955
00:52:30,584 --> 00:52:32,585
Me too.

956
00:52:33,587 --> 00:52:35,588
But it's gonna be okay.

957
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:40,594
MOLLY: Look!

958
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:02,614
MOLLY: I got this.

959
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:05,617
Molly, I don't think
this is a good idea.

960
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:07,620
We don't have a choice,
Cleo.

961
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,622
This moth may be
my only hope.

962
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:13,625
Please be careful, Molly.

963
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,627
I'm getting closer.

964
00:53:15,627 --> 00:53:17,630
Come on, moth!

965
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,632
Almost got it. Almost there.

966
00:53:19,632 --> 00:53:21,633
- Hold on!
- Come on, moth!

967
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:22,635
Ohh! I lost it!

968
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:24,636
( both scream )

969
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,641
( coughs )

970
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:33,606
Molly, are you okay?

971
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,484
( Molly grunting )

972
00:53:37,484 --> 00:53:40,070
<i>No! I am  not  okay!</i>

973
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,654
I am very much not okay.

974
00:53:42,654 --> 00:53:45,657
I am in a cemetery,
at night, soaking wet,

975
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:49,621
covered in swamp ooze,
and now I'm gonna
be invisible forever.

976
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:51,663
- We still have time.
- Just forget about it.

977
00:53:51,663 --> 00:53:54,666
We can't.
We can't forget about it.
We can't give up.

978
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,794
Maybe we should just go home,
leave all the lights on,

979
00:53:56,794 --> 00:53:59,671
- and try to draw a moth in.
- And then what?

980
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:00,798
You can reverse
the invisibility?

981
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:03,675
For sure? Because
as far as I can tell,

982
00:54:03,675 --> 00:54:06,678
you really have no idea what's
actually happening to me.

983
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:10,516
I'm done.
I'm done with your science

984
00:54:10,516 --> 00:54:13,684
and your judgments
and your sarcasm.

985
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,229
I'm done with all of it.

986
00:54:15,229 --> 00:54:18,689
Come on, Molly.
This isn't you.

987
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:20,692
You're supposed to be
the positive one.

988
00:54:20,692 --> 00:54:22,694
Just leave me alone.

989
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:25,406
If I'm gonna be
invisible forever

990
00:54:25,406 --> 00:54:27,699
and have my life
completely ruined,

991
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,700
I want to face it alone.

992
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,996
You of all people
can relate to that.

993
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,708
Come on, Molly.

994
00:54:39,127 --> 00:54:41,713
Molly?

995
00:54:41,713 --> 00:54:44,715
Molly! Come on!
Come back! Molly!

996
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:51,848
Molly?

997
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:56,727
I don't know if you can hear me
or not, but if you can...

998
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:02,733
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
about the sarcasm.

999
00:55:04,028 --> 00:55:06,737
I'm sorry about everything.

1000
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:12,743
It's just not easy...
being your sister.

1001
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:31,761
You've got this thing...

1002
00:55:34,057 --> 00:55:36,767
this light.

1003
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:40,770
Everyone is drawn to you.

1004
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:46,069
And it's hard sometimes...

1005
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:51,741
because...

1006
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:53,783
the truth is...

1007
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,788
that I've always
wanted to have that.

1008
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,505
And when...I didn't...

1009
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:12,802
it was much easier...

1010
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:16,806
to blame you...for feeling...

1011
00:56:18,807 --> 00:56:20,810
...invisible.

1012
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,813
So...

1013
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:32,821
I pushed you away...

1014
00:56:32,821 --> 00:56:36,826
and...everything...

1015
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,829
everything away.

1016
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,837
I should have come for froyo.

1017
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:56,554
MOLLY:
You can come for froyo
next time.

1018
00:56:59,848 --> 00:57:00,849
Molly, you're here.

1019
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:02,851
I'm here, sis.

1020
00:57:06,855 --> 00:57:07,856
He never saw me comin'.

1021
00:57:26,874 --> 00:57:30,879
It's almost nine.
We only have a few hours
until midnight.

1022
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,880
Hopefully George has gotten
everything set up in the lab.

1023
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,426
MOLLY:
That would be great.

1024
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:40,888
Oh. Oh! Ohh. Ohh.

1025
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:43,891
( streetcar bell dings )

1026
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,902
Did you mean
what you said back there?

1027
00:57:54,902 --> 00:57:56,904
About always
feeling invisible?

1028
00:57:59,907 --> 00:58:01,909
I'm sorry.

1029
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:04,912
I had no idea.

1030
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:08,916
I get now how rough
that would have been.

1031
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,919
<i>he funny thing is,
've always been envious of  you.</i>

1032
00:58:11,919 --> 00:58:14,922
- Me?
- Because you're a genius.

1033
00:58:14,922 --> 00:58:16,924
You get straight A's
with your eyes closed.

1034
00:58:16,924 --> 00:58:19,927
I kill myself
and barely pass.

1035
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:21,928
You have other things
going for you.

1036
00:58:21,928 --> 00:58:23,931
Like what?

1037
00:58:23,931 --> 00:58:27,227
Lacrosse?
Popularity?

1038
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:30,938
Both are pretty useless
after high school.

1039
00:58:30,938 --> 00:58:33,941
Molly...

1040
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:35,943
that light I was talking about,

1041
00:58:35,943 --> 00:58:37,944
it isn't because you're friendly

1042
00:58:37,944 --> 00:58:41,949
or pretty or a good athlete,

1043
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:45,495
it's because...

1044
00:58:45,495 --> 00:58:47,954
you make those around you happy.

1045
00:58:49,957 --> 00:58:53,960
You see what they need,
and you make them better.

1046
00:58:56,964 --> 00:58:59,966
It's like
the best kind of smart.

1047
00:58:59,966 --> 00:59:01,968
You really think so?

1048
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,973
I know so.

1049
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:07,974
I've been you all day.

1050
00:59:12,979 --> 00:59:15,982
Okay, there's just enough time
to go home and get changed

1051
00:59:15,982 --> 00:59:17,984
before we meet George at school.

1052
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:24,992
Finally! Where have
you guys been?

1053
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:26,992
The building's locked.

1054
00:59:26,992 --> 00:59:28,995
I don't know how we're
gonna get inside.

1055
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,003
Leave it to me.
I have an idea.

1056
00:59:37,003 --> 00:59:41,006
That is why I do kung fu.

1057
00:59:41,006 --> 00:59:43,008
I'm a black belt.

1058
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:45,304
Well, a brown belt.

1059
00:59:45,304 --> 00:59:48,013
Oh, okay,
I'm a yellow belt.

1060
00:59:48,013 --> 00:59:51,016
But I am a very advanced
yellow belt.

1061
00:59:51,016 --> 00:59:52,017
( knock on door )

1062
00:59:52,017 --> 00:59:55,021
Let me call you back.

1063
01:00:03,028 --> 01:00:06,033
Hello?

1064
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:08,033
Anybody out here?

1065
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:36,061
( whoosh )

1066
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:27,111
Huh?

1067
01:01:40,124 --> 01:01:41,250
MOLLY:
Boo!

1068
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,126
Aah...

1069
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:49,132
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1070
01:02:00,143 --> 01:02:02,981
Let's add a little
more sodium...

1071
01:02:09,152 --> 01:02:10,864
Okay, we got it.

1072
01:02:10,864 --> 01:02:12,155
Good.
Let's analyze it

1073
01:02:12,155 --> 01:02:14,158
so we can figure out
how to make an antidote.

1074
01:02:18,161 --> 01:02:20,163
I don't understand.

1075
01:02:20,163 --> 01:02:23,126
The solution's complex.

1076
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:29,172
This is heavy
organic chemistry.

1077
01:02:30,591 --> 01:02:32,175
So now what?

1078
01:02:32,175 --> 01:02:34,177
We have to find someone
who can sort through this.

1079
01:02:34,177 --> 01:02:36,179
Someone who knows
what all that means.

1080
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:38,180
Who?
A governor scholar
at chemistry.

1081
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,183
Believe it or not,
it's Carter.

1082
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:42,185
- What?
- It's true.

1083
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:44,897
I heard him talk about
a bunch of crazy science stuff
with George.

1084
01:02:44,897 --> 01:02:47,190
Trust me, if anyone
can help us, it's him.

1085
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,191
And I know just where
to find him.

1086
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:53,196
( dance music playing )

1087
01:02:53,196 --> 01:02:55,198
♪ Shake that body
show me that la la ♪

1088
01:02:55,198 --> 01:02:57,200
♪ Shake that body... ♪

1089
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,203

1090
01:03:00,203 --> 01:03:02,204
MOLLY: Carter said
he's volunteering tonight.

1091
01:03:02,204 --> 01:03:04,206
He's gotta be
in there somewhere.

1092
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:06,626
What's wrong.

1093
01:03:06,626 --> 01:03:08,210
If I go in there,

1094
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,212
then Carter's going to know
I like him.

1095
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:12,633
And I do.

1096
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:14,217
And he likes you too.

1097
01:03:14,217 --> 01:03:15,217
We don't know that,
Molly.

1098
01:03:15,217 --> 01:03:18,220
If a girl like me lets on
she likes a guy like him,

1099
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,516
then he usually ends up
laughing in her face.

1100
01:03:20,516 --> 01:03:23,225
If he did that,
he'd miss out

1101
01:03:23,225 --> 01:03:24,226

1106
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:37,239
No outside food or drinks

1107
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:38,239
School rules still apply.

1108
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,368
What are you thinking?

1109
01:03:40,368 --> 01:03:41,368
COUG: Cleo?

1110
01:03:41,368 --> 01:03:43,538
Oh, no.

1111
01:03:43,538 --> 01:03:45,247
Um, hi, Coug.

1112
01:03:45,247 --> 01:03:47,249
- Is your sister around?
- No, she's not,

1113
01:03:47,249 --> 01:03:49,250
but we really have to go.

1114
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,252
Wait, wait.
I just really need to know.

1115
01:03:50,252 --> 01:03:51,252
Is Molly dumping me?

1116
01:03:51,252 --> 01:03:54,255
No, no, she's just
really busy.

1117
01:03:54,255 --> 01:03:56,258
You don't have to
protect me, Cleo.

1118
01:03:56,258 --> 01:03:58,260
She's avoiding me.

1119
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,261
I mean, she loves
Romp the Swamp.

1120
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:03,265
She'd never miss it.

1121
01:04:03,265 --> 01:04:04,265
Would you just tell her
one thing?

1122
01:04:04,265 --> 01:04:07,268
Tell her I just want her
to be happy.

1123
01:04:07,268 --> 01:04:09,271
That's all I've
ever wanted.

1124
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:11,272
And if she's happier
without me,

1125
01:04:11,272 --> 01:04:14,276
then I can learn
to live with that.

1126
01:04:14,276 --> 01:04:17,278
Somehow.

1127
01:04:17,278 --> 01:04:19,280
( sobbing )

1128
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,284
The Coug's okay.
He's not crying.

1129
01:04:23,284 --> 01:04:27,288
( Coug sobbing )

1130
01:04:27,288 --> 01:04:30,290
Coug...

1131
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,293
I've never been
the biggest fan of yours,

1132
01:04:32,293 --> 01:04:34,295
but I was wrong.

1133
01:04:34,295 --> 01:04:35,296
Hmm?

1134
01:04:35,296 --> 01:04:37,258
Molly's really lucky
to have you.

1135
01:04:37,258 --> 01:04:39,300
And if you'll just
give me a second,

1136
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,301
she'll be back.

1137
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:42,303
I just miss her
so badly.

1138
01:04:42,303 --> 01:04:44,305
MOLLY:
I miss you too, Coug.

1139
01:04:44,305 --> 01:04:46,306
Molly?

1140
01:04:46,306 --> 01:04:47,308
I'm not breaking up
with you.

1141
01:04:47,308 --> 01:04:50,311
I'm right here.
I'm just invisible.

1142
01:04:50,311 --> 01:04:52,313
Like you can't be hurt?

1143
01:04:52,313 --> 01:04:55,316
No, that's "invincible",
babe.

1144
01:04:55,316 --> 01:04:57,317
I'm "invisible".
I can't be seen.

1145
01:04:57,317 --> 01:05:00,320
This is very confusing.

1146
01:05:01,322 --> 01:05:03,324
Oh... Oh!

1147
01:05:03,324 --> 01:05:05,325
Molly, it is you!

1148
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:07,327
Oh, I missed you too.

1149
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,330
Thank you for not
dumping me.

1150
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,331
Whoa, whoa, wait.
You're invisible?

1151
01:05:11,331 --> 01:05:14,335
Wait, what?
How?

1152
01:05:14,335 --> 01:05:15,335
This is completely crazy!

1153
01:05:15,335 --> 01:05:17,337
Coug, I'll explain later,

1154
01:05:17,337 --> 01:05:18,338
but if we don't
find Carter now

1155
01:05:18,338 --> 01:05:21,341
and make Molly visible
in less than an hour,

1156
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:23,343
you're going to go to prom
with an invisible girlfriend.

1157
01:05:23,343 --> 01:05:25,345
Which won't make for
great couples pictures.

1158
01:05:25,345 --> 01:05:27,057
Right?
Right.

1159
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:28,348
Okay, let's split up.

1160
01:05:28,348 --> 01:05:29,349
I'm gonna go to the yard,

1161
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:30,350
and you go into the house,

1162
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:32,352
and we'll meet in the barn
at the end, okay?

1163
01:05:32,352 --> 01:05:33,353
Okay, yeah.
Let's go.

1164
01:05:34,354 --> 01:05:39,359
( thunder, screams playing )

1165
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,362
Have you seen Carter
anywhere?

1166
01:05:52,372 --> 01:05:53,374
Have you seen a guy
named Carter?

1167
01:05:53,374 --> 01:05:56,376
Uh-uh.

1168
01:05:58,378 --> 01:05:59,922
You go in there.
I'm gonna go this way.

1169
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:03,092
Oh, uh, excuse me,
do you know where
Carter is?

1170
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:06,386
Soccer player,
about this tall,
luscious curls?

1171
01:06:07,513 --> 01:06:09,389
George, have you seen Molly?

1172
01:06:09,389 --> 01:06:12,391
Uh, "seeing" is really
the tricky word there.

1173
01:06:12,391 --> 01:06:15,394
We're out of snacks,
the bowl of fake eyeballs
turned mushy,

1174
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:18,397
the smoke machine
ran out of whatever
makes it make smoke.

1175
01:06:18,397 --> 01:06:19,398
Molly is supposed
to be here.

1176
01:06:19,398 --> 01:06:21,400
This is a complete
disaster.

1177
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,402
Nikki?
Yeah?

1178
01:06:23,402 --> 01:06:25,404
It's not a disaster.

1179
01:06:25,404 --> 01:06:29,243
This is the greatest
haunted house fundraiser ever.

1180
01:06:29,243 --> 01:06:30,702
Really?

1181
01:06:30,702 --> 01:06:33,412
Definitely.

1182
01:06:33,412 --> 01:06:34,413
Oh, are you having
a good time?

1183
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:42,130
See? She's happy,
and she doesn't even
have a head.

1184
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,422
You're doing a great job.

1185
01:06:43,422 --> 01:06:45,424
Thanks.
You're a really...

1186
01:06:45,424 --> 01:06:47,426
really nice guy,
George.

1187
01:06:47,426 --> 01:06:50,429
Thanks.
You're nice too.

1188
01:06:50,429 --> 01:06:53,432
Maybe we could
hang out sometime?

1189
01:06:53,432 --> 01:06:55,434
I'd like that.

1190
01:06:55,434 --> 01:06:57,435
Uh, great.

1191
01:06:57,435 --> 01:07:00,438
To be continued.
See you soon.

1192
01:07:07,445 --> 01:07:08,446
Carter!

1193
01:07:08,446 --> 01:07:10,448
( sighs )

1194
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:12,450
Can you guys
give us a sec?

1195
01:07:14,453 --> 01:07:16,454
Hey... you're here.

1196
01:07:16,454 --> 01:07:19,457
You're late, but here.

1197
01:07:19,457 --> 01:07:21,294
And you're not
in costume.

1198
01:07:21,294 --> 01:07:24,462
Um, no.
Costume?

1199
01:07:24,462 --> 01:07:25,881
Your bear costume?

1200
01:07:27,758 --> 01:07:30,468
Um... No.

1201
01:07:30,468 --> 01:07:31,469
Can I ask you something?

1202
01:07:31,469 --> 01:07:33,471
What's up with you?

1203
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:37,475
I mean, generally,
you're kind of standoffish.

1204
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:40,478
Today you're actually
nice to me,

1205
01:07:40,478 --> 01:07:42,480
and now you barely even
bother to show up.

1206
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,485
Carter, I'm so sorry
about the weirdness.

1207
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:52,032
The truth is...

1208
01:07:52,032 --> 01:07:54,491
I have always wanted
to hang out with you.

1209
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:57,205
And I never thought
that you would want

1210
01:07:57,205 --> 01:07:59,790
to ever hang out
with me.

1211
01:08:06,504 --> 01:08:08,505
What are you wearing?

1212
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:11,509
Uh, I'm--
I'm honey.

1213
01:08:11,509 --> 01:08:13,510
Honey?

1214
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,512
Yeah, you know,
I thought, 'cause, you know,

1215
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:18,515
with your bear costume,
I'd-- I'd be honey.

1216
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:21,518
'Cause, you know,
bears and honey are--

1217
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:24,940
they're kind of a...
thing.

1218
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:28,525
I-- I literally spent
all afternoon gluing felt.

1219
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:30,528
But, you know, since
you're not in costume,

1220
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:35,075
I-- I may have
overthought this
a little bit.

1221
01:08:35,075 --> 01:08:38,535
I really want to talk
to you about this,

1222
01:08:38,535 --> 01:08:41,538
and I want to talk to you
about a lot of things.

1223
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:45,835
But right now,
I really need your help.

1224
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:47,544
What is it?

1225
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:51,548
You should just not
see for yourself.

1226
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:54,550
It's just over here
in the barn.

1227
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:56,553
Isn't the barn
off-limits?

1228
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:00,099
Carter.

1229
01:09:00,099 --> 01:09:02,558
Hey. Hello.

1230
01:09:02,558 --> 01:09:04,561
What's going on?

1231
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,563
Okay, here we go.

1232
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:11,568
Hey, Carter.

1233
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:14,571
Whoa, Carter,
Carter, Carter...

1234
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:18,574
Wow, this is
a sophisticated solution.

1235
01:09:18,574 --> 01:09:20,576
But I think I can
work out an antidote.

1236
01:09:20,576 --> 01:09:23,579
The problem is we only
have 45 minutes.

1237
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:26,583
'Cause at midnight,
we're toast.

1238
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:29,585
The tricky part is
after we create the antidote,

1239
01:09:29,585 --> 01:09:32,588
we need to distill
its steam.
Of course.

1240
01:09:32,588 --> 01:09:33,590
The steam is what
turned the moth invisible,

1241
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,591
so that's what Molly needs
to drink.

1242
01:09:35,591 --> 01:09:37,593
But how? We don't have time
to get to the lab.

1243
01:09:37,593 --> 01:09:40,431
We can make a homemade still.

1244
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:42,598
All we need are a few
simple components.

1245
01:09:43,599 --> 01:09:46,602
Hey, sorry, fire code
violation, gotta take this.

1246
01:09:46,602 --> 01:09:48,604
CLEO:
A heat source...

1247
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:56,612
some tubing...

1248
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:58,614
Sounds better
without these notes.

1249
01:10:03,619 --> 01:10:05,620
CLEO:
... and a funnel
of some kind.

1250
01:10:11,627 --> 01:10:15,630
CARTER:
Ok, so now that we've
created the antidote,

1251
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:18,633
all we need to do
is boil it...

1252
01:10:21,636 --> 01:10:22,638
then distill its steam...

1253
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:29,644
so that Molly can drink it
before midnight.

1254
01:10:39,654 --> 01:10:41,656
Okay, here we go.

1255
01:10:41,656 --> 01:10:43,658
It's almost midnight.
We've got 40 seconds.

1256
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:44,659
MOLLY:
Is it working?

1257
01:10:44,659 --> 01:10:45,660
Just one drop...

1258
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,661
and another one.

1259
01:10:46,661 --> 01:10:48,663
This is gonna take forever.

1260
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:52,667
30 seconds.

1261
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:54,668
Oh, come on, boil faster!

1262
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:56,671
PERKINS (banging on door):
Hey! Open the door, people.

1263
01:10:56,671 --> 01:10:59,674
- It's Perkins.
- Ignore him.

1264
01:10:59,674 --> 01:11:01,676
PERKINS:
Whoever's in there
better come out,

1265
01:11:01,676 --> 01:11:02,676
or you're gonna meet
my good friend,

1266
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,679
Mr. Detention!

1267
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:07,224
Less than 20 seconds.

1268
01:11:07,224 --> 01:11:08,682
Come on, work,
you stupid machine.

1269
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:12,687
PERKINS:
Come on.
What's going on in there?

1270
01:11:15,649 --> 01:11:17,109
( clock chiming )

1271
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:18,692
Okay, Molly,
this should be enough.

1272
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,112
Drink it.

1273
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:22,697
PERKINS:
Seriously, open up!

1274
01:11:22,697 --> 01:11:25,700
People, your actions
have consequences.

1275
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,701
MOLLY:
I have to do something
for you first.

1276
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:30,122
What are you doing?

1277
01:11:30,122 --> 01:11:32,706
MOLLY:
It'll just take a second.

1278
01:11:34,668 --> 01:11:36,710
You kids are in
some serious trouble!

1279
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,712
Mr. Perkins, it's Molly.

1280
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:41,716
Cleo turned me invisible
for her science project.

1281
01:11:41,716 --> 01:11:43,718
You have to know
how special she is.

1282
01:11:43,718 --> 01:11:45,719
( clock chiming )

1283
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:51,725
Oh, no.

1284
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,743
Molly, what did you do?

1285
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:14,748
MOLLY:
I had to make sure
Mr. Perkins knew, Cleo.

1286
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:17,751
You did something amazing
the world had to see.

1287
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,753
We missed the deadline.

1288
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:22,756
MOLLY:
It was a risk I was
willing to take for you.

1289
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:25,759
Molly, I'll never see
your beautiful face again?

1290
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:28,762
That's okay, we can still
have a life together.

1291
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:31,764
Maybe even with little
half-invisible kids someday.

1292
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,769
So you actually did this?

1293
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:39,732
You really turned
your sister invisible.

1294
01:12:39,732 --> 01:12:43,776
I-- I-- Okay,
I can't get my mind
around-- around this.

1295
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,195
Uh...

1296
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,780
No, no, we can't give up.

1297
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,782
There has to be something else
that we can do.

1298
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,493
Your calculations were
conservative.

1299
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:52,912
There should have been
enough time, it should
have worked.

1300
01:12:52,912 --> 01:12:55,498
Well, then, there's
something we're missing.

1301
01:12:55,498 --> 01:12:57,789
Molly, did you eat
anything weird last night?

1302
01:12:57,789 --> 01:12:59,085
Meatballs.

1303
01:12:59,085 --> 01:13:01,629
Huh? The meatballs.

1304
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:06,799
Wait, you had a game
the next day.

1305
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,801
You were nervous.
Ginger fizz.

1306
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:09,802
MOLLY:
I drank some
with the moth.

1307
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,804
Then that's what
we're missing.

1308
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,807
Its acidity must have
impacted the solution
somehow.

1309
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,808
Do you have any on you?

1310
01:13:16,808 --> 01:13:19,812
MOLLY:
I never leave the house
without it.

01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:33,826
Drink it.

MOLLY:
Hey, no matter
what happens,

1314
01:13:35,827 --> 01:13:38,831
I really liked spending
the day with you.

1315
