to have this guy just stop by just to say hi
and say what's up to Cincinnati.

you doing some big things there, man.

00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,455
What's actually going on?
What's bringing you back to Cincinnati?

11
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,217
You know, this is my place of origination,

12
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,853
so the first thing you want to do
if you make any success,

13
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,989
is you want to go back to where it started,

14
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,998
and you want to try
to put something back there.

15
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:26,094
And I'm not really interested in whatever
political issues are involved with that.

16
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,369
My concern is, you know...
First of all, let me say

17
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,705
that I do want to respect
other people's opinion

18
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,405
and what they're doing
in a very serious situation.

19
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,005
So I don't take the boycotters lightly at all.

20
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,482
On the other hand, I am a public official.

21
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,144
I am beholden to the public,

22
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:45,315
and I view my job
as seriously as a fireman does his job.

23
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,020
So a fireman goes where the fire is and tries
to put out the fires. That's what he does.

24
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,561
I'm a comedian. I make people laugh,

25
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,131
and the best people to make laugh
are the people that are hurting.

26
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,565
So I go where people are hurting,
and I stand on the stage,

27
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,136
and I make people laugh
for an hour and a half, two hours.

28
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,729
Now, if you think that that's so serious,

29
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,605
you feel like that's something
that shouldn't be done by me,

30
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,043
then I'm sorry.
We just have a difference of opinion.

31
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,547
That's good. That's a good thing,
and, you know, I applaud you for that,

32
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,742
especially remembering home.

33
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,183
A lot of people don't.

34
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,414
They kind of leave
where they say they're from,

35
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,285
and then they never want to come back
and give back,

36
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,426
which is good 'cause you bringing in
some healing, 'cause l...

off my mind, I go to a comedy show.

I can put a little salve on it for a second.

I know y'all want to know.
I'm going to tell you.

00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,353
I saw a nigga with spinner hubcaps.

Them motherfuckers
didn't even spin on they own.

That nigga had to get out of the car
and spin them bitches manually.

185
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:32,442
I come to Cincinnati and I hear

186
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,605
that the Cincinnati government
want to honor a nigga.

187
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,340
Now, automatically, I am caught off guard,

188
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,018
for I know this must be
some sort of a government type of setup.

189
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,615
I know a nigga must have a warrant
he overlooked or something.

190
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,456
I'm expecting, at any moment,

191
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,625

They were very vague.

They didn't tell me what the fuck that means.

What that mean?

That mean that weed is legal in my vehicle?

Street niggas don't know nothing
about boycotts.

about what the opposite of boycott is.

hungry enough to eat up
everything in your house.

337
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:08,084
That's the side effects.
Hungry, happy, sleepy. That's it.

338
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,255
I don't know.

339
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,157
What I don't know
is why they ain't made weed into a pill.

340
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,369
They can clone sheep.

341
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,404
They can make a baby without the mama.

342
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,972
Remember the cell phone?

343
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,339
When that motherfucker came out,
was it not this goddamn big?

344
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,509
Came in a suitcase with a shoulder strap.

345
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,307
Now the cell phone is so small
that by next year

346
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,715
it's just gonna be
a chip on a nigga's tongue.

347
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,545
You just gonna be smoking
a cigarette, yeah...

348
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,655
(lMlTATlNG CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)

349
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,387
"Hello?

350
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,584
"No, nigga, I got you on the tongue phone.

351
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:42,953
"Hold on. I got another call.

352
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,358
(CLlCKlNG TONGUE) "Hello?"

353
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,734
You gotta be careful, though.
Got to be careful.

354
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,904
You have to pay attention to your schedule.

355
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,974
I had to have a meeting
with all the weed salesmen in Cincinnati

356
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:06,609
and explain to these niggas
that I need regular weed.

357
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,645
I have shit to do. I have an agenda.

358
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,783
I don't want shit with a nickname.

359
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,349
Not Thriller, Killer, Salmonella,
none of that shit.

360
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,996
I want it to say, right on the bag,
"Regular Weed".

361
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,194
Regular weed, you get the munchies,
and you can live your life.

362
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,797
This nigga in Cincinnati two days ago
sold me some shit

363
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,932
had me looking
at the refrigerator for four hours.

364
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,904
I'm just in the kitchen on the stove, just...

365
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,780
"l bet you, ain't shit in there.
I bet you, there's shit in..."

366
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,689
You know the weed is too good
when you hit it and look at it. Just...

367
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,164
"Ah, nigga, there's something in here.
There's something in here. That..."

368
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,035
Something...

369
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,898
You just...

370
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:09,245
You just gotta do everything in moderation.

371
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,480
'Cause I thought
that all weed smokers were created equal,

372
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,387
but that's not the case, not the case at all.

373
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,289
I live in Los Angeles now,

374
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,521
and I was hanging out with Snoop Dogg.

375
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:30,295
Now, this nigga
is a professional weed smoker.

376
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:34,133
There is not an amateur bone
in this nigga's body.

377
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,070
I was not prepared.

378
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,377
We was doing The Tracy Morgan Show.
He did an episode.

379
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,241
The nigga said, "Katt,

380
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,780
"when we take a break,
we gonna hit some weed."

381
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,879
Now I took out of that conversation,
two words,

382
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,920
"Hit". "Some weed".

383
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,420
Now, I can do that.
I know the rules and regulations.

384
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:58,155
-I know I get the blunt, puff, puff...
-AUDlENCE: Pass.

385
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,460
I see you are aware
of the regulations as well.

386
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,566
So I'm feeling like everything
is gonna be okay.

387
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,401
I'm gonna smoke enough weed
to be sociable,

388
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,310
go back to my room and learn my lines.

389
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:19,310
Now, I need to explain to you that it's,
in this room, only me,

390
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,785
Snoop and his two partners.

391
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:28,025
We are in a circle.
I watch him roll one and light it

392
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,387
and put it in rotation.

393
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,997
And it starts to go in rotation.

394
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,598
After about four and three-quarter minutes,

395
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,403
I start noticing
that I am higher than I have ever been

396
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,544
my entire life.

397
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,648
I mean, I am high, high.

398
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,846
Like I'm up on the world,
looking down at the planets and stars.

399
00:25:56,154 --> 00:26:00,488
Just satellites and my mama house
where I grew up in Avondale.

400
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,322
Just all of it. I can see it.

401
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:08,528
And I'm thinking,
"How in the hell could I be this high

402
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,667
"off one blunt?"

403
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,472
I look up and notice
these niggas have lit six blunts,

404
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,270
and they are all in rotation at the same time.

405
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,774
We look like an Olympic track meet
in that bitch.

406
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,487
It's bullshit.

407
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,293
That's why you just gotta live your life.

408
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,602
'Cause other people's life,
it may look better than yours,

409
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,968
but that does not mean that's the way it is.

410
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:52,007
I live in LA now. I'm finding out
that most of that shit that I thought was real

411
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,372
was bullshit.

412
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:58,678
I met DMX two months ago.
This nigga is the same size as me.

413
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,520
I don't know why I thought
that nigga was 6'12" or something.

414
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,959
That nigga is two inches taller than me,

415
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,120
and he talk like that for real.

416
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,898
We in a restaurant, he, "Hey, yo, bitch.

417
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,902
"Let me get some water and some lemon."

418
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,371
"Now, nigga, why are you hollering?
We in a restaurant.

419
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,739
"Don't nobody holler like that
in no restaurant."

420
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,577
You know, that nigga wasn't shit in school.
He couldn't cheat at all.

421
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:34,174
"Hey, yo, bitch.
What's the answer to number seven?"

422
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,809
(BARKlNG)

423
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,387
"Nigga, you need to be in a special class.
What the..."

424
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,092
I'm out there in LA.

425
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,899
I've been making friends
with basketball players.

426
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,434
Just niggas I've been watching
for a long time.

427
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:55,063
People like Ruben Patterson
from the Portland Trail Blazers

428
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,970
and Shaquille O'Neal.

429
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,203
Just big six-foot, eight-foot niggas.

430
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,447
I found out I can't even really be friends
with these niggas in public

431
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,649
'cause they too fucking tall.

432
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,354
I'm trying to congratulate you on the game.

433
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,619
You got your dick
all around my forehead region.

434
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,316
This is bullshit.

435
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,229
"Nigga, good game, good game."

436
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,242
Just saying you got to live your life.

437
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:41,079
See, I notice a lot of this shit
'cause I have a disease.

438
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,953
I'm allergic to stupid shit.

439
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,284
Now, some of y'all
might have that same disease,

440
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:52,354
but, if you have the disease,
you know for a fact

441
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,566
that it does not start when you an adult.
It starts when you a child.

442
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:00,104
I can remember as a child
being allergic to stupid shit.

443
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,407
I can remember being in class.
The teacher said, "Katt, stand up."

444
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,842
"Bitch, I am standing up."

445
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,787
I hate her so much. I really do.

446
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,683
She says, "Spell 'kitchen'."

447
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,823
So, I sounded it out,
as I had been instructed to do.

448
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,458
"Kit-chen. Kit-chen."

449
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:35,336
"K-l-T... Ch... Ch... C-H-E-N."

450
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,337
She said, "Very good. Very good.
Spell 'knife'."

451
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,368
Now, once again, church,
I sounded this motherfucker out.

452
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,473
(SLOWLY) "Knife."

453
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,285
"Knife."

454
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,949
"N-l-F-E. Knife."

455
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:58,221
She said, "No, no, I'm sorry. It's K-N-l-F-E."

456
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,224
This bitch is stupid, she really is.

457
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,869
"Uh, yes, that would be ka-nife. Ka-nife."

458
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,300
This is what she told me
in front of the whole class.

459
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,470
She said the "k" is silent.

460
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,374
I said, "Then take
that quiet motherfucker out, then,

461
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,211
"'cause it's confusing me."

462
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,752
Right after class,
I cut that bitch with a ka-spoon.

463
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,314
Just what the fuck are you talking about?

464
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,763
Now, just in case you think I'm tripping,

465
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,094
we are all adults now.

466
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,795
Can you please tell me
the purpose of the silent letter?

467
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,871
Have you ever been able
to use one in your own personal life?

468
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,704
"My name is Bob. That's B-K-O-B."

469
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,973
"No, nigga, your name is Bkob.
It's right there, Bkob."

470
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,988
Math. Math was my favorite subject,

471
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,755
because everything that had been said,
I could verify.

472
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,028
She said, "Two and two is four."

473
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,300
Damn sure is.
All the time, nigga. All the time.

474
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,898
Then one day this bitch
just flipped the script.

475
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,871
"Three X plus Y equals what?"

476
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:26,506
This bitch is still teaching.
Do you see this shit?

477
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,186
"Did you notice some of them was letters?

478
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,483
"Yes, bitch, that's for words and sentences."

479
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,488
Now, that was just the shit
they told us when we were little.

480
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,164
Now that we grown,
these motherfuckers still think we stupid.

481
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,672
They got commercials on television
where they lie

482
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,540
and tell the truth at the same time.

483
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,575
Now, how fucking stupid do I have to be

484
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:01,345
for you to lie
and tell the truth at the same time?

485
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,546
They got commercials say
you can get a brand-new Expedition.

486
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:09,423
No credit, bad credit, bankrupt,
divorce, parole violation,

487
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,554
whatever your problem is,
on approved credit.

488
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:25,338
Did you say no credit,
bad credit, on approved credit?

489
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,006
That's like you go to the club

490
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,842
and a girl tell you,
"I'm gonna give you some pussy. Never."

491
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,283
But that's not the same, then. That's...

492
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,054
Then they got commercials for medication
where the side effect

493
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,490
is worse than the shit that they're curing.

494
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,965
And I didn't think
nobody was noticing but me.

495
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,202
All I'm saying,
if I'm taking something for asthma,

496
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,139
I don't need the side effect
to be shortness of breath.

497
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,776
That's what the fuck I came to you for!

498
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,280
They got some shit called Xenical.
Now, Xenical is a fat blocker.

499
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,383
And if weight is heavy on your mind,

500
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,686
you got to be excited about
something called a fat blocker,

501
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,452
because you might not necessarily
wanna stop eating,

502
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,195
but you wouldn't mind something
blocking the fat every now and again.

503
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,804
They show you the lady.
She's a little overweight. She's unhappy.

504
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,306
Three seconds later,
she's in a bikini running through flowers,

505
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:37,609
and you think,
"l want to run through some flowers, too."

506
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:43,147
Because you envision a pill in your throat
all day just blocking fat. Just...

507
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,595
Then they say possible side effects

508
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,563
are gas with an oily discharge,

509
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,994
diarrhea and the inability to stop it.

510
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,797
What the fuck?

511
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,731
Gas with an oily...

512
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,176
It's already embarrassing
to fart in church as it is.

513
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,839
Now you got to ruin your clothes?
You just...

(RAZZlNG)

515
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,315
That ain't never coming out, lady.

516
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,718
No, nigga, that's oil. That's oil.

517
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,919
Just gotta make your own decisions.

518
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,427
They tell you
you should not smoke cigarettes

519
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,626
because it will stunt your growth.

520
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,374
And when you a kid they tell you,
"Drink all your milk,

521
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,868
"eat your vegetables,

522
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,249
"so that you can grow up big and strong."

523
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,913
And I remember as a child

524
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,914
drinking milk every day.

525
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,322
"Just bring a cow in and let me
get up under him and drink

526
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,690
"some fresh milk

527
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,530
"so I can be big and strong.

528
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,531
"Broccoli. Give me all the broccoli,
and greens and spinach."

529
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,970
Let me show y'all some shit
y'all not gonna believe.

530
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,540
Would my mother and father
please stand up in the audience right now?

531
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,844
I'm looking around.

532
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,643
Now, look up there at my parents
up at the top.

533
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,587
My daddy 5'5" and my mama 5'3".

534
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,316
What the fuck was I drinking milk for?

535
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,724
Shit!

536
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,859
I could have been eating Lemonheads
and baked beans all day.

537
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,462
Y'all don't know. It ain't no fun.

538
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,905
Cincinnati right now worried about
black and white prejudice.

539
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:47,137
That ain't shit compared to the prejudice
of being short

540
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,840
in American society.

541
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,812
This is bullshit.

542
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,544
You don't know how I had to overcome.

543
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,921
Ain't no parades. Ain't no marches.
Jesse Jackson don't show up.

544
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,887
All the shit y'all take for granted,

545
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,393
Iike that little thing
your mama put by the door

546
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,429
to mark your size every year.

547
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,557
We just had one dark-ass line.

548
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,101
My mama wrote
"Forget about it" on the top of it.

549
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,330
Just one dark...

550
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,702
Then you grow up and be the same size.

551
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,241
You got to be a pimp.

552
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,206
You can't just be no regular nigga this size.

553
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:30,080
I can't even go to an amusement park.

I can't ride this goddamn ride?

I'm a grown-ass man!

Spent $100,
I gotta ride in a teacup with little kids. Just...

559
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,203
This is bullshit.

560
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:53,744
When we get out this motherfucker,
I am gonna kick your motherfucking ass.

We be wanting to do better so bad.

565
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,724
You got to be happy
with however your life is right now.

but you gotta be happy
with whatever you got right now.

stop talking shit about your raggedy car.

you don't have to have
that raggedy car conversation.

Now, we all know
the raggedy car conversation.

you gotta look at the nigga in the Escalade

between 24 and 28, nigga.

670
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,443
That nigga don't want to be left out.
"Twenty-six!"

671
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,038
Thought we were doing bingo in this bitch.
That's E 26.

672
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,980
That's so long. I can't even...

673
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,883
Shit!

674
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,013
Twenty-four,

675
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,592
twenty-six, twenty-eight years.

676
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,328
Just... Goddamn, that's beautiful.

677
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,954
Just day after day after day

678
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,726
of the same motherfucker.

679
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,028
Just every time you wake up...

680
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,366
Just, "Shit! You again!

681
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:58,368
"Why don't you all go on a vacation
or some shit?"

682
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,736
That's some beautiful shit.

683
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,814
If you done found somebody
to walk with you every day... See...

684
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,381
See, a month, a month and half, see...

685
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,521
Sometimes, y'all still have arguments
and disagreements,

686
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,216
but at 24, 26 and 28,

687
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,852
these motherfuckers don't even talk
to each other no motherfucking more.

688
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,929
Sometimes she just be looking at him.

689
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,055
"Just look at this nasty-ass nigga.

690
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,801
"He gonna smell that shirt.
It smell like yesterday, motherfucker!

691
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,770
"Put it on! I don't give a shit.
I don't give a shit."

692
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,038
Sometime he be looking at her like,

693
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,805
"She gonna ask me,
does this dress make her look fat?

694
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,940
"l ought to just go on and tell her,
'l see you naked!

695
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,175
"'Stop blaming it on the dress!"'

696
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,988
But that's some beautiful shit,

697
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:50,686
if you done found somebody to walk
with you every goddamn day.

698
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,762
Now, let me show you something,

699
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,397
if you don't mind.

700
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,399
Single people,
make some motherfucking noise.

701
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,469
Now did you hear...

702
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,810
Did you hear how exciting that sounded?

703
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,317
I know that a month, a month and a half,
had a flashback

704
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,387
to when you, too,
was happier than a motherfucker. Just...

705
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,957
(SCREAMlNG)

706
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:25,357
'Cause as single people,
we always act like we the shit.

707
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,193
And we are. We really are.

708
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,894
We the shit as long as we out.

709
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,603
We quick to tell a motherfucker,
"When you going home?"

710
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,504
"When the fuck I want to go home.

711
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,806
"I'm single, free to motherfucking mingle."

712
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,507
That is till you get home
in that lonely-ass kitchen.

713
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,541
You just in the kitchen...

714
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,683
"Why won't you send me somebody, Jesus?"

715
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,354
I'm just saying, whatever you got in your life,

716
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,763
be happy with what you got.

717
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,065
Now, this next thing I'm gonna say
is just for the fellows.

718
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,806
If this don't apply to you,
just forget I even said it.

719
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,675
If you got a crazy-ass baby mama...

720
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,214
This nigga's testifying in the back. Just...

721
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:38,161
First of all, if your baby mama is that crazy...

722
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,532
Uh-huh.

723
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,736
(MAN YELLlNG)

724
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,410
I done say something about babies' mamas

725
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,849
and triggered this nigga's
Tourette's syndrome.

726
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,012
This nigga just calling out area codes.

727
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,350
Just, "513!

728
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:00,718
"404!

729
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,052
"213!

730
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,816
"686!"

731
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:08,787
If your baby mama is that crazy,
the first rule you need to remember

732
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:12,164
is keep your hands
to your motherfucking self,

733
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,067
because these police do not give a shit

734
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,673
about niggas
if they have to come to the house.

735
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,975
Oh, they don't give a shit.

736
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:23,774
You can be laying on the ground
with both of your eyes black

737
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,371
and your arm broke,

738
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:29,509
and she gonna be on the couch,
laughing her motherfucking ass off.

739
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,614
Policeman come. "Ma'am, did he hit you?"

740
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,749
"Hell no.
I knocked his motherfucking ass out!"

741
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,785
"Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

742
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,954
"But as you were knocking him out,
as he was falling back,

743
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,657
"did he clutch at you?
Did he clutch at you?"

744
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:46,434
"He damn sure did.
I half forgot all about that.

745
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,767
"Y'all say bye to your daddy,

746
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:53,075
"'cause he had clutched at me,
and I forgot in the shock of the moment."

747
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,572
So rule number one

748
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,778
is keep your hands to yourself.

749
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,443
Rule number two

750
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,852
is if you got a crazy-ass baby mama,

751
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:09,551
just try and work with her ass if you can,

752
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,151
'cause you might not want
her motherfucking job.

753
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,661
That's all I'm gonna say.

754
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,891
I'm a single father. My son is nine.

755
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,194
I done have him
since he was nine months old.

756
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,362
All I'm saying is it's a job
raising these motherfuckers.

757
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:25,134
We do not give women enough credit
for this single-parent shit.

758
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,640
You can stop clapping.
Some of y'all ain't even good mothers.

759
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,238
Ain't good mothers at all.

760
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,375
Your baby at home right now alone.

761
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:40,318
Your baby sleepy and crying,
just waking up to...

762
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:45,418
"l don't want to watch cartoons no more!"

763
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,365
All I'm saying is there's more
to raising these motherfuckers

764
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:54,369
than being at the mall dressed alike, fellas.
That's all I'm saying.

765
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:56,598
It's a job raising these motherfuckers.

766
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,642
First of all, if you a parent,
you gonna be tired.

767
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,643
It ain't shit you can do about it.

768
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:05,237
My son wake up at 5:30
every motherfucking morning.

769
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,250
He don't give a shit about
weekends, weekdays,

770
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,219
national holidays, Katt Williams Day,

771
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,050
what time Daddy got home.

772
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,091
At 5:30 every morning, he is up.

773
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:19,162
And not only is he up at an ungodly hour,

774
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,289
he ain't got no job. He ain't got no bills.

775
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,798
He ain't got no stress.

776
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,302
So not only is he up
before Jesus and the Mexicans,

777
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,304
he is happy.

778
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:33,064
He is happier than a motherfucker
for no apparent reason.

779
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,942
Just every morning at 5:30 he just,
"Good morning, Daddy!

780
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,447
"Time for some cereal."

781
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,647
This is bullshit.

782
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,845
I could put that nigga to bed at 5:28.

783
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,549
At 5:30 he just, "Good morning, Daddy!

784
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,755
"Time for some cereal."

785
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,458
Shit!

786
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,495
If you've got young kids, just take my advice

787
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:01,067
and be happy
at whatever level your child is on.

788
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:06,374
Because as parents we always want our kids
to be doing some shit they ain't doing.

789
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,004
Like when my son couldn't talk,

790
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:13,616
all the fuck I wanted him to do was to talk.

791
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:18,044
Didn't nobody tell me that once
this nigga started talking,

792
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,816
he would be qualified to ask me
500 motherfucking questions

793
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:27,392
back to motherfucking back,
while we wait at a stoplight.

794
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,227
This nigga just in the car, just...

795
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,739
"Why is the McDonald's sign yellow, Daddy?

796
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,708
"What part of the chicken
is a chicken nugget, Daddy?

797
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,645
"What's the difference between
barbecue sauce and hot sauce?

798
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:48,479
"ls barbecue sauce just sweet and tangy
and hot sauce ain't tangy?

799
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,783
"What is tangy, Daddy?
Is that kind of like sour but it ain't sour?

800
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,391
"Why you crying, Daddy? Why you crying?"

801
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,925
"l don't know shit!"

802
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,525
That's my motherfucking nigga, though.

803
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,799
You just gotta figure your kids out.

804
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,133
You got to figure your kids out.

805
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,470
I know some of y'all
been letting your kids stress you.

806
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,976
Do not let your kids stress you.

807
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:19,208
You gotta understand the world
is against you and your baby.

808
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,313
The world is about money,

809
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,709
making money.

810
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,720
They don't give a fuck
about you raising your children.

811
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,220
Commercials are 30 to 60 seconds long.

812
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,887
Your child's attention span
is 30 to 60 seconds long.

813
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,494
That's why they want everything.

814
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,003
You can go to the store and buy your child
everything in the toy store on aisle 7.

815
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,105
I swear before God,
he'll get to aisle number 8 and be like,

816
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,368
"But, Daddy, this wasn't even in there."

817
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,670
You just gotta figure out
how to deal with your kids.

818
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,578
I tell my son the truth.

819
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,710
I agree with whatever can be agreed with.

820
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:59,482
I know that nigga want everything,
but I understand he just want me to know.

821
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,783
He don't expect it.

822
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,883
This is him for an hour, watching TV, just...

823
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:07,059
"l love that bicycle, Daddy.
You see that bicycle?

824
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,600
"lt got a bell and everything. I like bells.
I might as well just ring it.

825
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,601
"Ding, ding. You'd know I'm in
the driveway when I ring it.

826
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,672
"That movie come out Friday, Daddy.
We gonna be here Friday.

827
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,866
"We might as well see the movie Friday.

828
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,272
"l love Pokemon, Daddy.

"Tomorrow, nigga, you never know.

835
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,679
"Yep. Yep."

836
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,817
At the end of the hour, I ain't bought shit.
He ain't got shit.

837
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,091
We both happier than a motherfucker,
sitting on the couch.

838
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:45,490
I'm just saying,
do not let your kids stress you out.

839
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,036
See, I don't know

840
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,770
how you raise your kids.

841
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,397
We all raise our kids different,

842
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,942
and I know a lot of comics
mess with white people

843
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,740
and tell white people
they need to beat their kids.

844
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,274
But let me tell you something.

845
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,674
It ain't that.

846
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:05,277
It ain't like niggas got it all down pat
when it come to raising kids.

847
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:08,255
We all got problems.
We just got different problems.

848
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:13,022
It would seem like white people
are a little bit too lenient on their children

849
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,165
and niggas are a bit too harsh on ours.

850
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,733
All I'm saying is at the white family's house,

851
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:22,202
you can get time out
for setting the family dog on fire.

852
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,708
At the nigga household,
you can get beat half to death

853
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,176
for forgetting to feed the family dog.

854
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,712
Now, that's the same goddamn dog.

855
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,074
We just do shit differently.

856
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,675
But white people,
please take this back to your community.

857
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:41,318
Please stop putting your children

858
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,652
on them goddamn leashes.

859
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,890
That is just entertainment for niggas.

860
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:51,027
We... Oh, we can't wait to see
that shit in the store.

861
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,897
We get right by the register, just...

862
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,968
That's why white little kids wake up
and grow up

863
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,633
to be twenty-six
and kill everybody in the family,

864
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,837
'cause you done had them
on the leash like a dog.

865
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:04,379
They just in the toy store, just,

866
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,108
"l want it. I want it. I..."

867
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,258
Now, black people laughing
like we got the shit down pat.

868
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,794
We ain't no good, neither.

869
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:23,593
You got to stop beating your motherfucking
kids in the goddamn grocery store.

870
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,258
You just in the checkout line,

871
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,268
soon as your baby touch the Skittles, you...

872
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,429
"Didn't I tell you not..."

873
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,941
"Just... Ma'am, that baby is a toddler.

874
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,637
"You can't beat that..."

875
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,811
Just saying, don't let your kids

876
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,413
stress you out.

877
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,017
I don't know how you raise your kids,
but I'm a pimp.

878
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,985
Not because I put women on the street.

879
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,326
I think pimp, therefore I am.

880
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:58,401
I see some niggas writing it down.
Feel free. Feel free.

881
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,004
So,

882
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,669
the first rule of pimping is you don't lie.

883
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,865
So I don't lie to my son about nothing.

884
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:10,469
He's nine. He ain't never
believed in Santa Claus. I'm sorry.

885
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,413
I cannot afford for him
to walk around thinking there's a white man

886
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,178
going though the ghetto,
giving niggas PlayStations.

887
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:20,313
"No, no. Daddy bought
that with his weed money, baby.

888
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,984
"Can you say 'sacrifice'?"

889
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,456
Sacrifice.

890
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,330
We have real conversations.

891
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:31,728
That nigga came to me

892
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,761
a few months ago. He said,

893
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,362
"Daddy, I want an Xbox."

894
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,442
I said, "Sit right here, pimpin.

895
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,510
"Let Daddy holler at you.

896
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,612
"Now, the first thing I need you
to understand is the Xbox

897
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,911
"is $199.99.

898
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:52,154
"Now, Daddy can do this all day, every day.
No problem.

899
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,155
"But I need you to understand
it only comes with one controller.

900
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:58,225
"That mean Daddy can't play with you.
Your friends can't play with you.

901
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,727
"It's just you.

902
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,821
"That mean I gotta buy
another controller at $34.95.

903
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:06,163
"Now, Daddy can do this all day,
every day. No problem.

904
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:09,261
"But I need you to understand
it only come with two demo games.

905
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,364
"You gonna be through
with them motherfuckers tonight.

906
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:16,839
"That mean I got to buy four or five
other games at $45 to $55 apiece.

907
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:20,211
"Now, Daddy can do this all day,
every day. No problem.

908
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:24,419
"Or I can look in the newspaper
under the classified section

909
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:28,457
"and I can get you what's known as
a Nintendo 64.

910
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,891
"Now, it's not gonna be new.

911
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,286
"So it's gonna come with, like, 20 games

912
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:38,490
"that other kids have already opened
and played with to make sure it's fun.

913
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,835
"Then me and you got, like, $300 left over.

914
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,636
"We can go all across
the country stopping ice-cream trucks.

915
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,371
"Buy six nuggets. Don't eat six. Eat three.

916
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:50,969
"Throw the other three out the window,

917
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,447
"'cause we don't give a fuck,
'cause we got money like that."

918
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,713
And that nigga sit right there,
make a pimp decision.

919
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,516
He's just, "You say 20 games?

920
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,584
"Well, we're just going to get
the Nintendo, then, Daddy."

921
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,752
That's my motherfucking nigga!

922
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,523
Make a pimp decision!

923
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,101
When the new Jordans come out,

924
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:19,137
I take that nigga to the Foot Locker
with the rest of the children,

925
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,170
and let him try them on.

926
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,705
"No, they tight. They tight.

927
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,248
"All right, I want you to do me a favor.

928
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,319
"l want you to run down this aisle real quick.
I'm gonna time you.

929
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,746
"On your mark,

930
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:36,121
"get set, go!

931
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,816
"Five seconds! Five seconds!

932
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,828
"That was good. That was good.
Take them off. Put them off.

933
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,031
"Come with Daddy to Payless.
I want to show you something.

934
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,396
"l want to show you something.

935
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:49,095
"Now, put the Batmans on.
Put the Batmans on.

936
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,072
"Make sure the Velcro is tight.
Make sure the Velcro is tight.

937
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:57,009
"On your mark, get set, go!

938
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:01,249
"Three seconds!
All I'm saying is you're faster in the Batmans.

939
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,818
"Now, sit right here, pimpin.
Let Daddy holler at you.

940
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:09,616
"Now, if you want the Jordans,

941
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:14,023
"Daddy gonna get you the Jordans
all day, every day. No problem.

942
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,198
"But for the same price as the Jordans,

943
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:20,963
"you can get the Batmans, the Robins,
the Pokemons, the Digimons,

944
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,605
"You can get... These don't have no name,
but they light up every time you walk.

945
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,470
"Just every step you take."

946
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,374
And that nigga bling-bling out the store.
He just...

947
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,315
Just saying,
don't let your kids fuck with you.

948
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,857
I learned my lesson.

949
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:49,062
Some of y'all do all your Christmas shit,

950
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,226
don't get around paying the bills till October.

951
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:59,234
October 19, you still paying off shit
from last Christmas,

952
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,768
'cause you trying to keep up
with white people. Fuck that.

953
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,314
Keep up with your budget.

954
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,441
You ain't got to spend all that money.
These is children.

955
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,950
You know, the same kids that play
with sticks and bricks?

956
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:15,047
Yes, the same motherfucking kids.

957
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,184
You done spent $1,300 dollars on Christmas.

958
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,393
Them motherfuckers don't even play with it
after the batteries run out.

959
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:23,890
This is bullshit.

960
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,198
You need to go to the 99-cent store
and buy them 100 toys.

961
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:34,134
They ain't gonna be name brand,
and they gonna tear up in a week,

962
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:38,044
but any child got to be happy
about 99 motherfucking toys.

963
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:42,379
My son was all under the tree, just,
"Daddy! Daddy!"

964
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,926
Nigga didn't even open them.
He just went to sleep. Just...

965
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,229
"l know my daddy love me.
I know my daddy love me.

966
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,365
"l know my daddy love me."

967
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,868
Just saying, life is short.

968
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:11,936
Gotta work on your relationships.
If you in a bad relationship right now,

969
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,316
you can end that motherfucker tonight.

970
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,208
End it tonight.

971
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,653
Life is too short
for you to be in a fucked-up relationship.

972
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,021
Just tonight, when the show is over,

973
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,289
just walk right past your vehicle
and keep on going.

974
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,864
Just, "No, I'm done. I'm done. Thank you."

975
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,500
Go right on down Fifth. Just...

976
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,361
'Cause life is too short.

977
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,695
Women, I know...

978
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,674
I know you all been
talking about niggas ain't shit.

979
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,675
I know you been saying it.
I been hearing you.

980
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,876
That's not the case.
On behalf of all niggas here this evening,

981
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:51,820
I want you to know
it's just been a misunderstanding.

982
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,316
Y'all just don't understand us. We are simple.

983
00:59:56,492 --> 01:00:00,553
Women, y'all think too much,
put too much pressure on yourself,

984
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:03,188
pay attention to too many magazines.

985
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:07,463
Niggas don't give a shit about most
of that stuff y'all be worried about.

986
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,971
"Oh, I think I'm gaining some weight,
and I got to get..." Every...

987
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,975
Every magazine a woman reads
say that you ain't shit.

988
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:18,479
Just every one. "You still wearing them
shoes? Bitch, you ain't shit. You ain't shit.

989
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:21,206
"ls that the makeup you're still wearing?
Bitch, you ain't shit."

990
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,046
I think I can speak for all niggas

991
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,620
when I say we don't give a fuck
about most of that shit.

992
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,247
It ain't a nigga in here
that ever been ready to fuck a woman

993
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:31,452
and then change his mind 'cause
she had on the wrong toenail polish.

994
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:35,053
It has never happened
in the history of mankind. Just,

995
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:38,463
"Oh, hell no. Is that plum?
No, that's plum, bitch.

996
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:41,594
"No, not plum and red.
I can't do that. I can't."

997
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,001
Women, you just gotta remember,
men are simple. We are simple.

998
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,842

01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,536
and I know that that makes
the bitch nigga think

1161
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:50,578
that maybe you don't have to do it.

1162
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,341
But, see, it's that type of thinking right there

1163
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:57,283
that qualifies you to be
a bitch nigga in the first place.

1164
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:01,180
Yeah, see, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I...

1165
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:08,019
See, real niggas know something
that bitch niggas have never ever found out.

1166
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:12,932
Oh, it's so quiet right now,
you could hear a bitch nigga drop, ain't it?

1167
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:21,506
See, real niggas know
I'm not eating the pussy for you.

1168
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,479
Oh, no. No, no.

Holler it out, then.

1171
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,740
If you understand what I'm saying.

1172
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:33,447
I'm not eating the pussy for you.
I'm eating the pussy for me.

1173
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:37,288
See, I don't need the pussy.
I know for a fact you already came twice.

1174
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,384
I felt you when you
clenched up on the motherfucker

1175
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,793
and damn near suffocated me.

1176
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:46,891
Now I have the rare opportunity
of surprising you with the dick.

1177
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,468
You forgot all about the dick. You just...

1178
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:52,864
"You brought dick, too?

1179
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:56,106
"Oh, my God, girl.
This nigga brought dick, too."

1180
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,074
Pay attention to me,

1181
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,674
if you would, bitch nigga.

a pain in your side

Iike you been exercising.

1187
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:23,066
Now, I know that this is ordinarily where
the bitch nigga just go on and call it a day,

1188
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,332
but if you can manage
to fuck through the pain...

1189
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,744
See, she don't know you in pain.

1190
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:34,111
She think you a genius
and are hitting it from the side.

1191
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:35,740
So continue to hit

1192
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,991

So every time you hear
he coming to your city,

1213
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:18,875
you need to buy tickets.

1214
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,016
If you don't buy tickets,
you gonna hear about it.

1215
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:24,258
We loved the show. It was great.
Everything was wonderful.

1216
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,991
And plus, you're a beautiful woman,
so that made us love it more.

It was all good.

1219
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:34,769
Oh, the show was outstanding, man.
We'll come back anytime. Had a great time.

Had a good time tonight, me and my family.

1223
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:45,536
We had a wonderful time at the comedy spot.

1224
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,079
God bless you, my nigga.
Keep doing the work.

1225
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,217
Thought the show was hilarious, Katt.

1226
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:56,385
Everybody else that performed tonight,
it was real, you know, real entertaining.

1227

It was good. It was good. He was real good.
He was really good.

1229
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:06,729
He was very, very funny.
He's different from the movies.

1230
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:10,637
He's gonna be an up-and-rising
big-star comedian. He's good. Very good.

1231
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:14,704
Most definitely the best comic view
I done seen in a minute.

1232
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,671
He tricked me.
'cause I didn't know he was that good.

1233
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,145
The man is excellent.
Everybody check him out for sure.

1234
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:23,343
It was wonderful.
I really did enjoy myself, you know.

1235
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:26,046
I had a few Budweisers,
had to keep coming in and out.

1236
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,452
but every time I made it back in,
I was always laughing.

1237
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,047
You know what I'm saying?

1238
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,719
It was a good show. He looked good,
had on... Was it the A1s?

1239
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:34,818
A1s?

1240
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,693
No, they weren't the A1s.
Those were the Als. It was...

1241
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:39,631
Them was the Jordans.
Yeah, the special editions, the XlXs.

The show was great. You couldn't...

1244
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:46,467
You know, you gotta see it.
They were really, really good.

1245
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:52,037
Everything was original. It was great.
It was really, really great.

1246

1247
01:15:56,451 --> 01:16:00,182
Right, yeah, it was real good.
Yeah, I had a good time. I enjoyed myself.

1248
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,083
It felt good to see
somebody from Cincinnati coming back

1249
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:06,354
and give us something back, yeah.
And I am from Avondale, too, so...

1250
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,053
It felt good to see somebody
making a comeback.

1251
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,865
Here's where I was born.

1252
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,964
Christ Hospital. Right here.

Yeah. Nineteen hours.

1254
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:22,138
That's how long my mama was in labor.
Nineteen hours.

1255
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,245
And I still didn't come out.

1256
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,914
I had a twin brother,
and me and him was fighting.

1257
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:32,216
It was a fight till death
and I choked him with my umbilical cord.

1258
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:33,579
That's what I thought.

1259
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,953
Later on I found out
I was born without an umbilical cord,

1260
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:38,618
so I can't really tell you
what I choked him with.

1261
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:41,092
But I will tell you he died a painful death.

1262

will tell you, whether they like me or not,

your favorite comedian probably is,

This is where it all happened.
I can remember this.

1269
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,679
I was here since I was five months,

1270
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,375
so, you know, the memories
are flooding in on me right now.

1271
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,114
I believe I stood right here as a baby.
I think I fell right...

Hold on. Hold on. It's coming to me now.

So you know you're moving up.

1276
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,992
When you come here,
you got heat and water from the beginning.

1277

A baby is not supposed to eat chili.

01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:16,600
It was in Tampa, Florida, and, um,

1321
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:18,943
I was, like,
the only black guy in the whole town.

1322
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:21,345
It was right outside of Tampa
in a place called Ruskin.

1323
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:23,349
And so I just did five minutes talking about

1324
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:25,681
me being the only member
of the black community.

1325
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,550
That the whole black community was me.

1326
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,955
And that people would drive by
and show their friends the black community.

1327
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:33,492
So... But I only had five minutes,
and I only needed five minutes.

1328
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:34,994
So it worked out well.

1329
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,189
Well, there's only one way. I mean, you...

1330
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:39,859
Obviously, you have to think
that you are funny going in,

1331
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:41,628
but the audience is the judge.

1332
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,135
It's not hard to become a comedian at all.

1333
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:46,069
You can walk on stage
and get booed off stage,

1334
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:47,573
and still call yourself a comic.

1335
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,769
What's hard is becoming
one of the great ones.

1336
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:53,211
So, I already knew
that we were facing a touchy situation.

1337
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:56,281
On the other hand, you know,
I'm not affiliated with the government.

1338
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:59,751
I get to come in
as an innocent bystander in the whole thing.

1339
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:03,916
I'm not... I'm not crossing your line.
I'm not crossing this line.

1340
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,751
Billy Cunningham.
My guest for the next segment

1341
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,591
is the honorable
actor/comedian Katt Williams,

1342
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:12,531
starring in a comedy special in Cincinnati,
September 25, to be filmed

1343
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,396
for TV and DVD.

1344
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:17,037
Katt Williams,
welcome to the Bill Cunningham show.

1345
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,332
Thank you, sir. 700 WLW.

1346
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:23,204
I understand you were born in Cincinnati,
and now I'm holding a proclamation.

1347
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,006
-This is unbelievable.
-ls that unbelievable?

1348
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:27,581
-I don't have my own day, but you do.
-Yes.

1349
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:32,517
"The mayor of the City of Cincinnati does
hereby declare September 24, which is today,

1350
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:34,186
"as Katt Williams Day."

1351
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:35,847
What did you do to get this, if anything?

1352
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:39,984
...he was down here and I promised him
the next time he comes back to the city

1353
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:43,258
that I was going to make sure
that I give him a key.

1354
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:48,399
Well, unfortunately, the city ran out of keys,
but, as I promised your assistant,

1355
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:52,372
that when they come in
I am going to mail them.

1356
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:57,071
But since we can't give you a key,
what we have done is decided

1357
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:58,941
-to give you a proclamation.
-Much better.

1358
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:02,710
And we're going to proclaim this your day.

1359
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:05,043
BlLLY: What does it mean
when you get a day? What does this mean?

1360
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,747
You get to speed? You get to pick up girls?

1361
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,551
What does this exactly mean?

1362
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,649
KATT: Well, I was doing those
on the other days,

1363
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,284
so I was hoping that it still continues.

1364
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:14,487
BlLLY: This is something special, then?

1365
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:17,030
I'm gonna read a couple of lines.

1366
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,728
I'll put on my glasses in case I tear up.

1367
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:24,896
Exactly. Can we have
a napkin, please? Tissue.

1368
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:30,475
"Whereas Katt Williams was born
in Cincinnati, Ohio on September 2."

1369
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:34,982
That's a... September 2.
I share the same month.

1370
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,847
My birthday is on Sunday,
so I'm going to be celebrating,

1371
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,352
bringing your birthday in.

1372
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:41,388
And I know Jill's birthday is tomorrow,

1373
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,253
so it's great to have
many September birthdays this month.

1374
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:46,390
"Do hereby proclaim

1375
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:50,394
-"that in Cincinnati, September 24...
-That's right.

1376
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:55,299
"...and on behalf of the Mayor
and its over 300,000 citizens,

1377
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:59,638
"do hereby proclaim Katt Williams Day."

1378
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,902
(CROWD CHEERlNG AND APPLAUDlNG)

1379
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:12,148
That's beautiful. See that? Look at that.

1380
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,120
Oh, I'm so proud right now. This is my day.

1381
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,087
I'm gonna be doing some...

1382
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:19,717
Misdemeanors is happening today.

1383
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,525
(CROWD CHEERlNG)

1384
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:26,489
That is such an honor, really,
for him to come here today. It is.

1385
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,432
But, you know, I always try to look

1386
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,629
at the positive things
and not the negative things.

1387
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:33,469
And it's truly an honor
to have him here today

1388
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:37,067
and really try and overlook...
And moving forward

1389
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,372
to the new and improved Cincinnati.

1390
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:41,073
Bye. See you later.

1391
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:44,975
CHRlS: You know, I applaud you for that,

1392
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,179
especially remembering home.

1393
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:48,585
A lot of people don't.

1394
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:50,914
They kind of leave
where they say they're from,

1395
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,789
and then they never want to come back
and give back,

1396
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:55,419
which is good 'cause you bringing in
some healing, 'cause I...

1397
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:56,895
Comedy is healing to me.

1398
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,263
You know, when I want to go get something
off my mind, I go to a comedy show.

1399
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:01,960
-KATT: Right.
-You know, 'cause it makes you laugh.

1400
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:04,663
For you to come here
and bring some healing, that's, like, wow.

1401
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:07,241
-You should be applauded for that.
-I appreciate that.

1402
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,967
Yeah, I mean, I can't fix the problems.

1403
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:12,410
I just got some Bactine and some Band-Aids.
That's my job.

1404
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:14,505
I can't heal you,

1405
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:17,608
but I can put a little...
I can put a little salve on it for a second.
