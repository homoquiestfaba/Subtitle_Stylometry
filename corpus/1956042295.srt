HOLLIS:
<i>My name is a real place.</i>

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,090
<i>It's where they found me
when I was a baby.</i>

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,110
<i>I used to imagine
it was the beautiful woods,</i>

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,599
<i>surrounded by bright,
colorful flowers,</i>

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,599
<i>singing birds
and a lush, green landscape.</i>

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>Truth was, it was
a street corner in Queens.</i>

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,609
<i>That's where I was left,
one hour old.</i>

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,110
<i>With nothing but a scrap
of paper that said,</i>

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,619
<i>"Call her Hollis Woods."</i>

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,120
<i>By the time I was 12, I had
been in five foster homes.</i>

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,120
<i>And when I'd finally thought
I'd found a family of my own,</i>

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,135
<i>I went and messed it all up.</i>

13
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:46,129
<i>I was always trouble
for somebody.</i>

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,630
<i>From the very beginning.</i>

WOMAN:
<i>I want you to think of this</i>

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,639
as a brand new start.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
You're turning over
a new leaf, Hollis Woods.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,149
She's a very nice woman.

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,150
Plus she's an art teacher.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,670
Mr. Regan wanted you
to keep up your art.

22
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,659
I don't care.

23
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,159
Well, I suggest you start.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,669
I'm a social worker,
not a magician.

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,669
We're running out
of options for you,

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,670
you know?

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,680
You need to make this work.

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
(car horn honking)

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,199
Oh!

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,700
There you are.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,709
You're finally here.

32
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,709
You must be...

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,709
Hollis Woods.

34
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,209
Hollis, this
is Ms. Cahill.

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,710
Hello, Hollis.

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,719
I don't bite, Hollis, I promise.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,219
I don't, but he does.

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,719
You'll have to excuse him.

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,229
He's got very bad manners,
haven't you, Henry?

40
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,230
Out you go.

41
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,229
Josie, it's good to see you.

42
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,739
It's been a long time.
It has.

43
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,239
We so appreciate
what you're doing.

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
It's my pleasure.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Won't you come in

46
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,740
for some tea or
coffee, lemonade?

47
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,250
I'll just let Hollis

48
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:44,260
get settled in.

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,250
I'm settled.

50
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,249
Oh, so she does have
a voice after all.

51
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,249
Oh, she has a voice, all right.

52
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,750
I'll come pick you up on Monday,
take you to school.

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,270
Get you introduced to all
the kids around here.

54
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:58,759
You and Ms. Cahill, take care.

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,259
(whispers):
Call me if there's
any problems.

56
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,260
Oh, there won't be.

57
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,780
Good-bye.
Bye.

58
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,769
I've taken care of quite a few
girls for Edna over the years.

59
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,279
You can call me Josie.

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,279
The last name
is spelled C-A-H-I-L-L.

61
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,279
But it's pronounced "Kale"
like the vegetable.

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,779
What should I call you--
Holly or Hollis?

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,289
Not Holly.

64
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,289
Oh, well, then, Hollis.

65
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,789
Just drop your bag anywhere.

66
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,789
This is my place.

67
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,290
I've lived here since
they invented the spoon.

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,799
Who invented the spoon?

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I don't know. The knife
and fork people, I guess.

70
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,320
And this is my studio.

71
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,319
Are these real people?

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Some of them.

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,820
What about her?

74
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,840
That's my cousin Beatrice.

75
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,829
I could make one of you,
you know.

76
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,329
We'd have to find

77
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,830
the right piece of wood first.

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,839
It all starts with the wood.

79
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,839
Ooh, let's see.

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,339
Oh, this might do...
Hmm, maybe not.

81
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,839
How about this?

82
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,340
No.

83
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,849
You know, these carvings
take a long time.

84
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,349
I can't start one unless
you decide to stay.

85
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,850
I'll tell you what.

86
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,859
If you'll stay,

87
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,859
I'll see to it that Henry here
is on his best behavior.

88
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,359
Do you hear that, Henry?

89
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,860
We're putting it all on you.

90
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,869
If you are an naughty kitty,
young Hollis here

91
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,369
just might

92
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,370
skedaddle out the front door.

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
What was I doing?

94
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,379
The right piece of wood?

95
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,380
Yes.
It all starts with the wood.

96
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,889
Here it is.

97
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,889
I found the perfect piece.

98
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,390
If that doesn't have
Hollis Woods

99
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,899
written all over it,
I don't know what does.

100
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,400
Oh, that is just right.

101
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
<i>Do you mind setting the table?</i>

102
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,409
The place mats are
in that top drawer.

103
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,410
Okay.

104
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,410
I hope you're going
to stay a while.

105
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,930
Some of my girls have
stayed for years.

106
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
That little girl...

107
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,420
she stayed the longest.

108
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,429
I still get letters from her.

109
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,930
What's her name?

110
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,430
I'm terrible with names.

111
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,440
It says...

112
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,940
"To Josie, love, Jenny."

113
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,950
Guess that's it then.

114
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
(knocking)

115
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
Yoo-hoo.

116
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,459
All settled in?

117
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,969
Oh, did you draw those?

118
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,969
Edna told me you were an artist.

119
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,970
Who's that?

120
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,969
Nobody.

121
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,979
I like to paint the ocean,
and the flowers I grow.

122
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,480
What do you like to draw?

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,980
Things that happen.

124
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,989
Well, maybe
you'll show me sometime?

125
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,489
Here's some towels.

126
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,989
And if you need anything...

127
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,490
I'm right down the hall.

128
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,510
Good night.

129
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,499
HOLLIS:
<i>Even if I wanted to,</i>

130
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,499
<i>I couldn't bring myself
to tell Josie</i>

131
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,509
<i>about that drawing or what
happened earlier that summer.</i>

132
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,009
Oh, Edna.

133
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,010
Well, our little
girl here is ready

134
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,010
for her big adventure.

135
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,019
Well, bye, Hollis.

136
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,020
Have a wonderful summer.

137
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,040
Get on the bus.

138
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,029
Did you see that?

139
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,030
She's having a tough time.

140
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,540
(indistinct talking)

141
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,540
All right.

142
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,060
You're going to have
a great summer.

143
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,549
Let me guess.

144
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,050
She doesn't want me back.

145
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,550
I'll find you another
placement in September.

146
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,559
Look, Hollis, this family
is willing to take you on

147
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,559
for a few months
and give you an experience

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,059
you've never had before.

149
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Out in the country.

150
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,080
Yeah, out in the boonies.

151
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:06,070
Just try to enjoy it.

152
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,569
Try to make the most of it.

153
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,570
Just try, Hollis.

Yeah, an adult.

Oh, great. Well, uh,
then we're all set.

Let's go.

180
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,679
You should offer
to take her bag.

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,189
Otherwise I would have offered.

184
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,189
Hey, how about I drive?
Ha.

185
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,689
Yeah. How about
you get in the back?

186
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,189
What?
I already drive the truck.

187
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,690
Yeah, you're learning,

188
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,699
and only at the cabin.

189
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Come on, Dad.

190
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:17,700
In, in, Steven. In.

191
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,200
So this is just our summer
home, Hollis.

192
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,720
It's nothing fancy or anything.

193
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:26,209
Yeah, nothing fancy.

194
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,710
Like nothing... at all.

195
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,709
I didn't know what
you liked to eat,

196
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,710
so I have, um, turkey,

197
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,210
ham or peanut butter.

198
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,210
Any of those sound good?

199
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,219
Turkey's okay.

200
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,720
Great. Sold.

201
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,720
You know, we might as well
break it to her, Dad,

202
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,719
It's not like
she won't find out.

203
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,219
No TV,

204
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,229
no DVD's, no video games,

205
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,229
and no Internet,
not even dial-up,

206
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,729
because there's not a phone.

207
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,730
It's a break from
distractions, from stress.

208
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,745
And we love it, Hollis,

209
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,239
and we hope you do, too.

210
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
(mild snoring)

211
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,239
Steven.
Don't worry,

212
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,739
we're gonna have
a wonderful summer.

213
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,740
(talking, laughing)

214
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,289
(birds chirping)

215
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,790
(river running)

216
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,790
You hear that river, Hollis?

217
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,290
My favorite sound in the world
to go to sleep to.

218
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,300
This is the old folks.

219
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,320
Um... I'm up in the loft.

220
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,810
And...

221
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,310
And this is you.

222
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,320
My mom's going
through a green phase.

223
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,820
It used to be blue.

224
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
It was gonna be
my brother's room.

225
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,329
What happened to him?

226
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,329
He died.

227
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,829
Oh.

228
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,830
Last year.

229
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:31,829
He was a baby.

230
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,330
Steven, your dad needs
a hand unloading.

231
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,839
STEVEN:
Oh, Mom...

232
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Tough life, kid.

233
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Don't forget
to bring in your books.

234
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
I won't.

235
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,839
I think Steven's excited to have
a new friend for the summer.

236
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840
We usually send him
part of the time

237
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,849
to camp, but, um,
we want the whole family

238
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,850
to be together this year.

239
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,859
We've never done this before,
hosted a child,

240
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,859
so anything you need--
anything-- you just ask, okay?

241
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,860
We really want you to enjoy
your stay here, Hollis.

242
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,370
<i>Adults are always hopeful
about new beginnings.</i>

243
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,390
JOSIE:
<i>Time to go, Hollis.</i>

244
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,380
I'm coming!

245
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,880
<i>Later that year,
Josie was hopeful, too.</i>

246
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,889
But not me.

247
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,890
(car horn honking)

248
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,890
Morning, Linda!

249
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,390
Edna.
Edna!

250
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:31,889
Good morning!

251
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,890
Oh!

252
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,910
Hold your horses.
Hollis...

253
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,899
I packed you a lunch.

254
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
There.

255
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,399
Have a fun day at school.

256
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Yeah, like that'll happen.

257
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,909
Anything could happen.

258
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,409
We could win a million dollars.

259
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,409
Or get hit by an asteroid.

260
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,409
Well, let's hope
for the million dollars.

261
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,420
(mouthing)

262
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,929
(school bell ringing)

263
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,930
(indistinct conversation)

264
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
Okay. Everything's
all set. You're in.

265
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,439
They don't want me here.

266
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Yes, they do. Come on.

267
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,949
Your homeroom is 113.

268
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,450
I know. I've done
the new-school routine

269
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,950
about a hundred times.

270
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,449
Okay, what's your
bus route home?

271
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,950
Number seven.

272
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,465
I get off at Roland Road.

273
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:35,960
The bus lady's
Mrs. Puzo.

274
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
I'm not an idiot.

275
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,959
No one has ever
accused you of that.

276
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,459
Hollis...

277
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,460
if you want friends,
you have to make friends.

278
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,475
What's the point?

279
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:46,470
I probably won't even
be here in a month.

280
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,470
(school bell ringing)

281
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,490
We have a new student
joining us today.

282
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
Please stand up and tell
the class your name.

283
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Don't be shy.

284
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,989
My name's Hollis.

285
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,489
Hollis Woods.

286
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,490
(class tittering)

287
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,989
Hollywood.

288
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,499
No. <i>Hollis... Woods.</i>

289
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,499
"Holl-iss. Wood-ss."

290
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,999
All right, all right.

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Settle down.

292
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,999
Hollis, is there
anything about yourself

293
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,499
you'd like to share
with the class?

294
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,010
No, ma'am.
Oh, I'm sure
there's something.

295
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,509
When did your family
first move here?

296
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,509
They didn't.

297
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,510
I'm just visiting.

298
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,025
It says here that

299
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:36,519
you're enrolled for the year.

300
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,519
Are they traveling?

301
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,519
No.

302
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,020
They're not traveling?
No.

303
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,029
All right.

304
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,030
Well, regardless.

305
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,530
We're all very
happy to meet you.

306
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,060
(door closing)

307
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:22,059
Good morning.

308
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,060
Hey, Josie.

309
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,080
Do you have anything hidden away

310
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,570
that I can take for lunch?

311
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,569
How about a can of soup?

312
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,569
Cream of, um...

313
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,069
What is it?

314
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,570
Those little, uh, brown things.

315
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,579
Cream of mushroom?

316
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
That's it.

317
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,580
I don't like that stuff.

318
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,080
I told you that--
like, a week ago.

319
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,090
Have you been here
a week already?

320
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,589
Oh, well, I am flattered.

321
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,590
Henry, are you flattered?

322
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,090
What should we do to celebrate?

323
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,599
Oh, I know!

324
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,599
I'm gonna take you
one of my favorite places.

325
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,099
What time is it? 8:30. Good.

326
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
The light'll be perfect.

327
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Wait a minute.

328
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Is it a school day?

329
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,119
No.

330
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,620
No, there's no school today.

331
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,130
There's a...

332
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:25,640
There's a teachers conference.

333
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,129
Oh.

334
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,129
Good.

335
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,630
Better bundle up because we're
taking the Silver Bullet,

336
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,640
(engine struggling)

337
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,650
(engine starts)

338
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,159
Don't blink or you'll miss town.

339
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,660
Sweet, isn't it?

340
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,669
I moved up here about
a hundred years ago

341
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,669
to live with my cousin Beatrice.

342
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,670
That's her movie theater.

343
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,169
You like the movies?

344
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,669
We get in free.

345
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,170
(chuckles)

346
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Josie...

347
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
Oh, for heaven sake.

348
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
I missed my turn.

349
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
(car horn honking)

350
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:23,180
Go around!

351
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,700
There's other cars
on the road, lady!
(horns honking)

352
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:27,189
Seat belt. Good idea.

353
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,190
I should have warned you.

354
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,690
Next time, I will.

355
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,689
Next time, you won't have to.

356
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,190
Stick around,
I'll teach you to drive.

357
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,209
JOSIE:
<i>Ah...</i>

358
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,210
I love this ocean.

359
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,730
I like the river.

360
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
Well, there's saltwater people

361
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
and there are freshwater people

362
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,220
and there are people

363
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,720
who don't like either one--

364
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,720
but they're not us.

365
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,229
You weren't born here?

366
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,730
No. I moved here to
live with my cousin Bea

367
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,729
when I was about your age.

368
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,739
You'll meet her
one of these days.

369
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,239
When you do, you better
keep you hands in your pockets.

370
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,739
Why?

371
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,239
You know what she did,
the first time I ever met her?

372
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,749
She said, "If we're
gonna share a room,

373
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,749
"you're either gonna be my
mortal enemy or my best friend.

374
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,249
Which is it gonna be?"

375
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,249
Then she grabbed my finger,
stuck it with a pin,

376
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,749
and made me a blood sister.

377
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,250
(laughing)

378
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,259
Crazy Bea.

379
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,259
Why did you have to live
with her anyway?

380
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,759
My parents died.

381
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,770
I had nowhere else to go.

382
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,290
You have a wonderful eye.

383
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,299
You have a wonderful eye.

384
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,799
We have four wonderful eyes.

385
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
(both laugh)

386
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,819
HOLLIS:
<i>Dear Miss Hornsby,</i>

387
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,319
<i>Please excuse Hollis for being
absent from school yesterday.</i>

388
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,820
<i>Hollis had a severe rash.</i>

389
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,329
<i>We learned that she's
allergic to tomatoes.</i>

390
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,829
<i>Pity, she really enjoys them.</i>

391
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,329
<i>Yours sincerely,
Ms. Josie Cahill.</i>

392
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,839
This penmanship is excellent.

393
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,839
Did you know
that Ms. Cahill

394
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
taught here for many years.

395
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,339
Here?

396
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,840
And for someone who
could draw so beautifully,

397
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,360
her handwriting was awful.

398
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:07,349
Oh.

399
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,349
Take this to the
Principal's office.

400
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,850
Nice try.
(kids laugh)

401
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,870
Busted.

402
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
(both laughing)

403
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,360
No way!

404
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,380
Oh, yes, Henry chased
that dog right up the tree.

405
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,369
You're gonna make
milk come out my nose.

406
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,370
I hate when that happens.

407
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
You're, you're making
my arms so long.

408
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,379
Those are your giving arms.

409
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,879
Arms of generosity.

410
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,379
(phone ringing)

411
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,380
Oh, I'll get that.

412
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,410
Ms. Cahill's residence.

413
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:58,899
EDNA:
Hollis? Hollis, is that you?

414
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,399
Oh, hi, Edna.

415
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,900
Why aren't you at school?

416
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,909
(coughs)
No, but I am sick.

417
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,409
Um...

418
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,909
Go get in bed.

419
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,409
All right.

420
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,410
Drink lots of liquids.
And rest.

421
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,430
Yeah. I will, I promise.

422
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,919
Let me talk to Josie.

423
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,919
Actually, she's kind of...

424
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,419
(coughs)

425
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,919
she's kind of busy right now,

426
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,929
but I'll tell her
to call you back. Bye.

427
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,429
Make sure you tell her...

428
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,929
Who was that?

429
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,930
Wrong number.

430
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,930
Oh.

431
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,439
Um, I think we're good on candy.

432
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,939
Oh, okay.

433
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,440
Tomato soup.

434
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,460
Our cart's full of soup.

435
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,949
What we don't have
is milk, sandwich stuff

436
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,950
and food for Henry.

437
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,950
Oh, good thinking.

438
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,450
Okay, I'll get the bread
and the cat food.

439
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,470
You get the milk.

440
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:57,960
Okay, done.

441
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,990
♪ ♪

442
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,520
♪ ♪

443
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
♪ ♪

444
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,059
Josie, you left your purse
where anyone could take it.

445
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Oh.

446
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,070
The milk's back there.

447
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,569
Oh, the milk.

448
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,070
I swear, they move things
around so much here

449
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,090
I can't find anything.

450
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,600
How long does this
have to last us?

451
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:09,089
Oh, a couple of weeks, I guess.

452
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,089
I think we ought to budget.

453
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,089
I had one of those
when I was little.

454
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,099
Bright green and yellow.

455
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,099
Flew out the window one day.

456
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,599
Never saw it again.

457
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,100
Budgies... hate to be kept
in cages.

458
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,609
I said "budget."

459
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,609
Budget, as in

460
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,610
planning how
to spend your money.

461
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,119
What's left of it, anyway.

462
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
(softly):
Budget...

463
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Josie?

464
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:45,629
Do I have a treat for you.

465
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,629
We're going to the movies.

466
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,129
What do we do for money?

467
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,130
(splutters):
Who needs money

468
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,130
when you got Beatrice
for a cousin?

469
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,149
This is yours...
to keep...

470
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,650
even when you leave.

471
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,159
Who says I'll leave?

472
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Well, you didn't say you'd stay.

473
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,160
I'm thinking I should.

474
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,180
Well, I better congratulate
Henry then, hadn't I?

475
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,670
Don't tarry, Hollis.

476
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,679
<i>The future was starting to look
bright again with Josie...</i>

477
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,180
<i>if I could just stop
thinking about the past.</i>

478
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
STEVEN:
That's three words.

479
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,189
Is it a book, a song...?

480
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,689
I did this.
Yeah, I know

481
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,690
you did that-- what's
it supposed to be?

482
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,189
It's a song.
A song? Dad--

483
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,689
this is a song.
Okay, all right,
guys,

484
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,690
come on, just play the game.

485
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,699
Hollis, do you want to play?

486
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,699
No, she'd rather draw Dad

487
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,199
making a total fool of himself.

488
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
IZZY:
All right, ease up.

489
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,699
This is supposed to be fun.

490
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
First word.

491
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,709
Oh, yeah, Mom,
this is so much fun.

492
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,210
You're an ape.
I don't, I don't...

493
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,229
Oh, sorry.

494
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,229
I was just, uh, I was clearing
out your drawers

495
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,729
so you can make
yourself at home.

496
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,229
It's okay, I...

497
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,230
like to keep my stuff together.

498
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,250
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I get it.

499
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,739
Night.

500
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,240
You have a lovely way
about you, Hollis.

501
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,249
I'm glad you're here.

502
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,749
Night.

503
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,250
Night.

504
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
Morning, Hollis.

505
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,759
Wow.

506
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,269
That's really good.
Have you taken lessons?

507
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,769
No.

508
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,270
You mind if I...?

509
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
You have talent.

510
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:20,280
(truck engine starts)

511
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,290
(irritated):
Stop.

512
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,290
Dad, I was just showing Hollis.

513
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,790
Showing off
for Hollis, you mean.

514
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,799
Am I in the truck with you?

515
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,300
No, but you're under
ten yards away.

516
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,299
Doesn't matter
if I'm ten inches away.

517
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
You don't drive

518
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:43,800
unless I'm in the cab with you.

519
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,810
Okay, I'll put it back.

520
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:46,315
No, you won't put it back

521
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:47,809
because that would be driving

522
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,310
without me in the cab.

523
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,319
Why don't you take
Hollis fishing?

524
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,819
She's been waiting.

525
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,320
IZZY:
I think that's
a great idea.

526
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,820
Come on, Hollis.

527
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:04,320
Come on.

528
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,339
Okay, they almost fit you.

529
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,839
Let's see.

530
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,340
That's not too bad.

531
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Sunscreen.

532
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
How about oxygen tanks?

533
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,849
Ha-ha. Did you
get bug spray?
Nope.

534
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,350
Okay, be careful.

535
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,869
Here you go.

536
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,369
Try not to move.

537
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,369
These fish
are super intelligent.

538
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,370
I think they're mutants.

539
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,379
Okay, cast like this.

540
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
Watch and listen.

541
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,380
All right, you go.

542
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,890
I got one!

543
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,890
No way!

544
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:14,390
Okay, come on!
Lift the rod up!

545
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,410
Don't put it down.
Come on. Lift it up!

546
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:19,899
Okay, don't jerk it!

547
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,899
Easy, now.

548
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Okay, keep the rod up.

549
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,410
Oh, come on!
Don't drop the rod!

550
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,409
Come on!
Keep it up!

551
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,410
Don't drop the rod.
Keep it up!

552
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,420
A little more.
Got him! Got him!

553
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,420
Okay, you got him.
Let's go.

554
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,429
I thought about
letting you drown,

555
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,429
but my parents would disown me.

556
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,439
Are you grilling that fish
or you smoking it, Dad?

557
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,939
Hollis, this
is the largest trout

558
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,939
I've ever seen
taken out of that river.

559
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,939
I hate you already.

560
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,449
This is fun, huh?

561
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,449
Aren't you glad you came out
into the country

562
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,450
with us, Hollis?

563
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,949
Don't worry the mosquitoes.

564
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,450
Dad will smoke them out.

565
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,460
What's that?

566
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
What?

567
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,959
HOLLIS:
That.

568
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,460
You see that?

569
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,969
Fireflies?

570
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,470
You've never seen
fireflies before?

571
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,980
Yep. The mosquitoes out
here have headlights.

572
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,519
Morning, kids.

573
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,019
What are you reading, Hollis?

574
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,019
<i>The Call of the Wild,</i>

575
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,519
by Jack London.

576
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Hey, that's a good book.

577
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,529
But isn't that
on <i>your reading list?</i>

578
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,030
Um... yeah, but I'm reading
some other book.

579
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,540
What?

580
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,040
Okay, uh, well,

581
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,039
we're going to go
get some groceries.

582
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,539
Hollis, is there anything
special you want?

583
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,540
All right, well,
while we're gone,

584
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,549
why don't you read
that <i>other book?</i>

585
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,550
Okay, okay.

586
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,550
Bye, kids.

587
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,559
I didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

588
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
That's okay.

589
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,560
Hey, now that they're
gone... come on.

590
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,080
Third! Put it in third!
Where's third?

591
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,070
This is so cool!

592
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,579
I can't believe
I'm driving a truck!

593
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,079
(laughing)

594
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,579
<i>There are some people
who live life</i>

595
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,089
<i>with a sense of fun
and adventure, like Steven.</i>

596
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,089
<i>Later that fall,
when Josie took me</i>

597
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,590
<i>to meet Bea for the first time,
I found another.</i>

598
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,099
Well, look who's here!

599
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,599
Hollis, this is

600
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Beatrice Gilchrist,

601
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,099
my cousin and best
lifelong friend.

602
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Not counting Henry, of course.

603
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,620
Josie's told me all about you.

604
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:50,109
You are quite
the artist, I hear.

605
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,109
I'm coming over
and seeing your work

606
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,609
before I leave town.

607
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,619
You're not leaving for ages!

608
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,119
Beatrice is going to New Mexico.

609
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,619
She's going to paint
the desert, lucky thing.

610
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,119
Just take your pick
of seats, ladies.

611
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
School nights are always slow.

612
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,140
Thanks.

613
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,130
Ladies, I'll take your tickets
right over here.

614
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
Popcorn, ladies?
Oh, yes.

615
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,139
It's a special recipe
we dreamed up years ago.

616
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,149
Fresh butter with, uh...

617
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,150
Parsley and chives.

618
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,649
I used to sell popcorn here
on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

619
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,150
help Beatrice run the place.

620
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,659
Did you get

621
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,659
to watch the movies?

622
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,159
Well, of course she
watched the movies!

623
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,160
You think I paid her?

624
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,669
Excuse me while
I start the projector.

625
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,670
Crazy Bea.

626
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,179
WOMAN (in movie):
Oh, Adam, I've tried so hard.

627
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,179
That poor little heart of yours.

628
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,679
Beatrice lives upstairs.

629
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
It's like a bowling
alley up there.

630
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,700
Can you imagine?

631
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:07,690
MAN:
Shh! Lady!

632
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,720
Josie?

633
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,730
Josie?

634
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,230
Josie, where are you?

635
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,250
I'm out here!

636
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,739
What smells so good?

637
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,240
I hope you're not cooking

638
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,260
because Beatrice
is bringing dinner.

639
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:10,250
It's those, uh...

640
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,249
Oh, you know.
Those little, uh...

641
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,259
Oh, what is it? Shoot!

642
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,259
It's, uh...
Delicious?

643
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,759
Oh, you know.
Those little, uh...

644
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Pasta? Pizza?

645
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,769
Sounds like...

646
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,769
I don't know,
but it'll be delicious.

647
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,269
BEA:
Yoo-hoo!

648
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,270
There she is!

649
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,770
Supper's here!

650
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,279
Chinese food!

651
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,779
Of course.

652
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,779
That's what we always have.

653
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,779
The first time I ever
laid eyes on Bea,

654
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,789
she looked at me and said,

655
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,789
"If I have to share
a room with you,

656
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,289
"you'll be my mortal enemy
or my best friend.

657
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,789
Which is it
going to be?"

658
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,289
Oh, I did not.

659
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,790
Don't believe a word
of this, Hollis.

660
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,299
I was scared to death of you.

661
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,799
She scared me to death.

662
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,299
I said, "I'll be your friend.

663
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,799
I'll be
your friend."

664
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
And then she grabbed

665
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,309
my finger,
and pricked me with a pin!

666
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,809
Oh, I was 14, going
through my dramatic stage.

667
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,310
Then she poked her own finger,

668
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,309
pressed it to mine, and said,

669
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,820
"There. We're blood sisters
from here on out."

670
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,819
Well, it stuck, didn't it?

671
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,320
It stuck, all right.

672
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,320
Enough dilly-dallying.

673
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,840
I came here to see some art.

674
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,830
Show her, Hollis.

675
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,349
Josie,

676
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,849
you lied to me.

677
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,350
This girl is not good.

678
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,360
She's amazing!

679
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,360
This gesture here.

680
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,869
Revelation!

681
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,869
Through a detail like that,

682
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,370
that is the sign of an artist.

683
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,879
Interesting choice...

684
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,380
Well, this is <i>my favorite.
Of course.</i>

685
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,890
(doorbell ringing)

686
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,900
Where's the phone?

687
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I can't find the phone!

688
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,909
Josie, it's the door.

689
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,410
Oh.

690
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,419
Oh, wait! Josie, don't answer.

691
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,419
Oh, hello.

692
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,919
Hello.

693
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
What a surprise.

694
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:03,919
Well, I bet it is.

695
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,929
Hollis, is there any reason
you aren't at school again?

696
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,930
School?

697
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,930
I guess we overslept.

698
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:15,430
Oh, it's my fault.

699
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,445
I kept her up late last night
watching old movies.

700
00:39:18,446 --> 00:39:19,939
I thought it was
your tomato allergy

701
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,439
acting up.

702
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
You poor thing.

703
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:24,440
Why didn't you tell me?

704
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,460
I've been feeding her tomatoes
up to the eyebrows.

705
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,449
You didn't even tell her I rang

706
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,449
the other day, either, did you?

707
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,949
Can I make you some tea?

708
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,950
No tea, thank you.

709
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,460
You have two minutes to get
dressed and ready for school.

710
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,959
Which is where she's supposed
to be, Josie, every day,

711
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,959
unless she's got
a legitimate excuse.

712
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,969
These are envelopes.
They are addressed to me.

713
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,969
They don't need any postage.

714
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,969
Every week, Hollis needs
to give you a completed

715
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,469
attendance card.
And every week,

716
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,970
you need to get those cards
to me without fail.

717
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,990
Oh, okay. Without fail.

718
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Hurry.

719
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,480
It's my fault.

720
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,989
I told Josie it was

721
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,989
a school holiday.

722
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,489
Oh.

723
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,990
Oh, I thought that was
last week.

724
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,490
Okay.

725
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Come on.

726
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,020
I'm not sure this
is working out.

727
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,020
But I like it here.

728
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,029
I'll go to school.

729
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,529
Every day.

730
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,029
I'll get good grades.

731
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,030
You'll see.

732
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Okay.

733
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,540
I guess we will.

734
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
(dishes clank)

735
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,110
(door closes)

736
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,619
You need to work on
your spelling, Craig.

737
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,620
Okay.

738
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,640
You didn't read
the assignment, did you?

739
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:29,129
Uh, I started to...

740
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,630
And, Hollis?

741
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,630
Nice work.

742
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,640
<i>If I really tried,
I could make things work.</i>

743
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,649
<i>It was such a cool feeling.</i>

744
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,649
<i>I hadn't felt that way
since summertime.</i>

745
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,150
Be careful climbing up.

746
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,160
This is my favorite spot.

747
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,170
Hmm...

748
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,670
wonder if I should give you half

749
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,170
or eat it all myself?

750
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,669
You should give me
the whole thing.

751
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,170
I deserve it.

752
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,179
That's what Dad would say.

753
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,179
You guys fight a lot, huh?

754
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,679
Yeah.

755
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,180
He's getting worse.

756
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,200
Doesn't want me to do
anything on my own.

757
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,190
Big or little?

758
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,700
Which hand?
That one.

759
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Little.

760
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,210
(giggles)

761
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
(laughing)

762
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:59,719
Yeah, that was a good one, Mom.

763
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,219
It was hilarious.

764
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,220
(laughing)

765
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,229
Hey.

766
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,729
Hey... I found this

767
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,230
in old box of
some things of mine.

768
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,250
I want you to have it.

769
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,740
Izzy...

770
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,740
Yeah?

771
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,760
I'm gonna go fix
that old screen door.

772
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:28,249
Ah, you're my hero.

773
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,249
Steven, why don't
you come with me?

774
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,750
Do I have to?
Come on, buddy.

775
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,250
Let's go.

776
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,769
Hey, Steven, here-- hold this.

777
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:56,280
(laughter, indistinct talking)

778
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,319
It's not quite finished yet.

779
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,819
Well, it's already beautiful.

780
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,319
I've still got a lot to do.

781
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,330
I've never had so many colors
to work with.

782
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,329
You know,

783
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,330
my mother gave me that drawing
kit for my tenth birthday.

784
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,339
I could draw killer spaceships.

785
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,840
But never people.

786
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
Beautiful.

787
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,850
<i>With Steven and Mr. Regan,
I never knew what to expect.</i>

788
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,849
<i>Months later, the same was true
with Josie and Bea.</i>

789
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,850
Yoo-hoo! Honey!

790
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,849
JOSIE:
Bea.

791
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,859
Josie, I need your
mega-size suitcase.

792
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,359
I sat on mine,
tried to force it.

793
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Broke the zipper.

794
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,360
(chuckling):
Oh, no.

795
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,860
Uh, Hollis...

796
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,369
could you get the suitcase?

797
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,869
Where is it?

798
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,870
Uh...

799
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,879
Is it in the closet?

800
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,880
Oh.

801
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,400
Holy cow, Josie.

802
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:49,390
You need to clean this out.

803
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,890
(clattering)

804
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,390
(laughs)

805
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,899
Got it.

806
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,399
Where are you off to?

807
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,900
Are you kidding?

808
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,900
New Mexico

809
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,409
to paint the desert.

810
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,409
We've been talking
about it for ages.

811
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,910
Oh... right.

812
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,930
Are you all right?

813
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,420
I'm fine.

814
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,919
Josie, if you're not
all right, I'll postpone.

815
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,420
Beatrice, I'm fine.

816
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:27,429
You sure?

817
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,930
Of course I'm sure.

818
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,929
What more do you want me to say?

819
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,429
Okay.

820
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:35,430
You can always call me

821
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,445
if there's a problem.
Exactly.

822
00:47:37,446 --> 00:47:38,939
I'll write down my cell.

823
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,439
Beatrice, I know your number.

824
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,940
You've had the same one forever.

825
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,449
Have fun.

826
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,449
And say hello to
Georgia O'Keefe for me.

827
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,449
Oh, you are all right,
you silly thing.

828
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,950
Of course I am.
Just ask Henry.

829
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,959
Call me if you need anything.

830
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,960
We will.

831
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:03,960
Hollis.

832
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,469
<i>Adios...</i>

833
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,470
<i>amigas.</i>

834
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,990
Crazy Bea.

835
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,480
(heavy object scraping floor)

836
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,490
(rustling)

837
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,520
What are you doing?

838
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,030
Cleaning the closet.

839
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,029
Can you... help me...

840
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:16,030
move this?

841
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,039
Everything looks
pretty good, Josie.

842
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,540
I think you've done it.

843
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,549
For now.

844
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,550
I have an idea.

845
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:35,550
How about we go to bed?

846
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,560
Good idea.

847
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,560
I'll tuck you in.

848
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,070
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

849
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,080
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

850
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,080
Merry Christmas.

851
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,579
See you next year.

852
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,080
Next year?

853
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,089
Oh, yeah, next year.

854
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,590
Merry Christmas.

855
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,610
Hollis.

856
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,120
I was in school.

857
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,629
I just got off the bus.
You can check.

858
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,129
Linda and I were just
visiting over tea.

859
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,629
(mouthing "Edna")

860
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,130
Edna.

861
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,650
And you'll never guess
what I did.

862
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:00,139
You know those...

863
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,639
forms I was supposed to mail?

864
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,140
To Edna...

865
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,650
Well, I mailed
the gas payment instead.

866
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,150
(chuckles)

867
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,660
Have you ever heard
of anything so dumb?

868
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,159
The gas company
is probably reading

869
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,160
your attendance record
right now.

870
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,180
It's not a big deal.

871
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,169
It was just the wrong envelope.
That could happen to anyone.

872
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,170
I know. I know.

873
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,679
Hollis,

874
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,679
Josie and I were just talking,

875
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,680
and we both agree that maybe
it's time for a change.

876
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,690
What do you mean?

877
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,710
Don't you want me anymore?

878
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,210
Is Hollis leaving?

879
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,710
That's what we were
just talking about.

880
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,219
I'd like to talk to Hollis
outside for a moment.

881
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,719
Josie, thanks again for the tea.

882
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,720
It was delicious.

883
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,739
Why didn't you tell me
what was going on here?

884
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,240
What?

885
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,760
You know what I'm talking about.

886
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,750
I'm not going.

887
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,250
Hollis...

888
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,270
Ms. Cahill is supposed
to be taking care of you.

889
00:52:58,271 --> 00:53:00,259
She is.

890
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,759
She just forgets
stuff sometimes.

891
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,260
You don't know Josie.

892
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,769
I've known her for 20 years.

893
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,270
This is something more
than just forgetfulness.

894
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,269
She has a serious problem.

895
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,270
It's only going
to get worse, sweetie.

896
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,790
(sobbing)

897
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,279
Ms. Cahill cannot be
responsible for you anymore.

898
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,780
I finally found a place I like,

899
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:27,300
and now you're just
dragging me away.

900
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,790
I'm not dragging you.

901
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,289
You'll have time
to say good-bye tonight.

902
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,299
I'll come for you
in the morning, okay?

903
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,299
To go where?

904
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,300
You'll go to the shelter,

905
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,800
until we can find you
another placement.

906
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,809
I am so sorry this
didn't work out.

907
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,810
I promise you can
come and visit.

908
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,819
I'll come and get you
at 9:00 in the morning.

909
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,319
Have your bag packed.

910
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,820
Come on.
Get in the house.

911
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,340
No.

912
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,349
Josie, we have
to get out of here.

913
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,350
We have to pack.

we want you in our family.

1096
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,539
I mean, we think
of you as part of
our family already.

1097
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,040
And we want

1098
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,549
to make it official.

1099
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,549
We love you, Holly.

1100
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,550
(sobbing)

1101
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,560
(sighs):
I knew there would be crying.

1102
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:21,059
So...

1103
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,560
what do you say?

1104
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:30,570
Well, say yes already!

1105
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:32,570
We have cake and ice cream.

1106
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,590
(softly):
Yes.

1107
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,579
Oh! (laughs)

1108
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,580
That's great.

1109
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,580
Come over here.

1110
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,089
Well?

1111
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,589
Sis.

1112
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:56,090
<i>When people say they feel
like they're floating,</i>

1113
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,099
<i>I know what they mean.</i>

1114
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,599
<i>That's the way I'd felt
that day.</i>

1115
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,600
<i>Now it was only a memory.</i>

1116
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,610
Wake up, Josie.
We're here now.

1117
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,109
Oh... okay.

1118
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:19,120
Oh, come on... Henry.

1119
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,620
Come on.

1120
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:36,630
Where's Bea?

1121
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,639
She's my best lifelong
friend, you know.

1122
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,639
Not counting Henry.

1123
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,640
(laughs):
Not counting Henry.

1124
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,660
You hear that, Henry?

1125
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,659
Come on. It's cold.

1126
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,160
(owl hooting)

1127
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,190
Where are we?

1128
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,180
This is where I used to live...

1129
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:29,700
before I messed everything up.

1130
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,199
When's Bea coming with supper?

1131
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,699
I'm, I'm hungry.

1132
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,709
She should be here.

1133
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:52,709
I'm looking for something
for us to eat right now!

1134
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:55,209
How old were we...?

1135
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,210
Josie, there's no food here.

1136
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,220
(door opens and shuts)

1137
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:10,230
(humming)

1138
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:22,239
Josie, those are wading boots.

1139
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,240
These?

1140
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,240
Those are for fishing.

1141
01:09:24,241 --> 01:09:26,740
They're not for walking.

1142
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,249
I think they're very stylish.

1143
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:30,750
(chuckles)

1144
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,270
Don't say it.

1145
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:51,769
I look like

1146
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,269
the abominable snowman.

1147
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,270
(chuckles)

1148
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:58,279
I'm going to catch us a fish.

1149
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,280
You like fish.

1150
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:03,280
Goldfish. I had one in a bowl.

1151
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:08,289
I think.

1152
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:10,289
But I couldn't trust Henry.

1153
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:14,290
To eat, I mean. For us.

1154
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,299
I'd never eat a goldfish.

1155
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,299
Stay here.

1156
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,300
Please?

1157
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,340
Come on, fishy.

1158
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:50,829
Be nice.

1159
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,330
Take a little bite.

1160
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,839
<i>I stood alone
in that river thinking,</i>

1161
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,349
<i>if only I had gone fishing
with Steven that day.</i>

1162
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,349
So, come with me.

1163
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,849
You like hiking,
so come with me.

1164
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,850
Oh, yeah, an hour of walking

1165
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,870
followed by a day
of watching you draw?

1166
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:20,859
It's our last day here.

1167
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,359
I've got stuff to finish.

1168
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,860
Okay, be that way.

1169
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,360
(mock sobs):
So I guess, this...

1170
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:28,869
this is good-bye?

1171
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:30,369
Shut up.

1172
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,369
Okay, whatever you do,

1173
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,370
be back by 3:00.

1174
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,869
Folks are taking us
into civilization.

1175
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,379
If I'm late, just
come pick me up.

1176
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,380
Yeah, right.

1177
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,899

I was only kidding.

Whatever you do, don't tell
Dad about the truck, okay?

1198
01:13:59,031 --> 01:14:00,520
He'll freak.

Josie, I didn't catch anything.

How's Steven?

1223
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,149
Steven Regan?

1224
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,649
How is he?
It's going
to be okay, honey.

1225
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,150
Just relax.
He's going to be fine.

1226
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,170
Let's get a full CT
with contrast.

1227
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,670
How's Steven?

1228
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:36,670
How are you feeling, huh?

1229
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,179
Where is he?

1230
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,679
Um, they're just...

1231
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,680
they're keeping a real
close eye on him.

1232
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:49,700
Please tell Mr. Regan not
to be mad at him.

1233
01:16:49,701 --> 01:16:51,189
It wasn't his fault,

1234
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,689
it was mine--
it was all because of me.

1235
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:56,690
I was late. I told him
to bring the truck.

1236
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,199
Nobody... nobody's blaming
anybody, okay?

1237
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,199
Nobody.

1238
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,699
Okay, you lay your head
back down.

1239
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,700
You try to get some
rest, all right?

1240
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,210
You're okay.

1241
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,260
Ma'am, I just found this.

1242
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:08,769
Thank you.

1243
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,769

EDNA:
<i>Every time I see her,
she asks about your son.</i>

1254
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,845
Hollis so clearly belongs
in your family,

1255
01:19:19,846 --> 01:19:22,340
but I've got to warn you,
she's on the run emotionally

1256
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,840
and I've had a hard
time reaching her.

1257
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,860
Holly.

1258
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:36,850
Mr. Regan drove all the way
from Hancock to see you.

1259
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,860
Steven is coming home soon.

1260
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,860
He's going to be okay.

1261
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:51,870
He and Izzy send their love.

1262
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,880
Oh, and I brought you
something that's yours.

1263

Here's your pictures
and your pencils.

1264

Look, Hollis...

1265
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,889
I need you to
understand something.

1266
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,399
No one blames you
for what happened.

1267
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,400
Okay?

1268
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,899
You're part of our family

1269
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,410

1270
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,410
You see?

1271
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:35,910
See that?

1272
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,919
That's where you belong.

1273
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,420
We want you to come back home.

1274
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:52,430
I think I'll stay here.

1275
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,439
What, what is going on
in your mind, Holly?

1276
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,440
Believe me, whatever it is,

1277
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,440
we can all work through it
together.

1278
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:29,980
We love you, Holly.

1279
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,479
I don't know what to say.

1280
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,479
Well, will you stay
in touch with us

1281
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,479
and let us know how she's doing?

1282
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,480
Yeah.

1283
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:50,500
Maybe she'll change her mind.

1284
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:12,509
I have had sympathy
for you, Hollis Woods.

1285
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:16,010
I realize that you have had
some hard knocks early on,

1286
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,020
but I am going to tell you
the truth, my dear.

1287
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,519
Are you listening?

1288
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,520
You're a coward.

1289
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,529
When things aren't
perfect, you run.

1290
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:30,029
Where did you get the idea

1291
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:32,030
that families are supposed
to be perfect?

1292
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:35,030
That's real.

1293
01:22:35,031 --> 01:22:37,530
Let me tell you something
that I do know.

1294
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,550
And trust me,
I know it for sure.

1295
01:22:39,551 --> 01:22:42,540
You got to take
a chance, Hollis.

1296
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,539
You got to be willing to risk.

1297
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,040
Don't think that
I don't see you.

1298
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:51,049
I know you.

1299
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:53,549
I have known you a long time.

1300
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,549
I know that you try
to play it safe.

1301
01:22:55,550 --> 01:23:00,559
If you don't risk anything,
you won't lose anything.

1302
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,559
Look at me.

1303
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:07,060
Hollis, here's the hard fact.

1304
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:11,080
Every one of us will eventually
lose everyone we love.

1305
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,570
So there's no time to waste.

1306
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:21,579
<i>Edna was right,
I had lost the Regans.</i>

1307
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:25,580
<i>That day in the woods, I didn't
want to lose Josie, too.</i>

1308
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:32,089
(humming)

1309
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:35,589
Look, I found us
a Christmas tree.

1310
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:37,090
Let's go decorate it.

1311
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,110
(hums)

1312
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:51,609
This goes on top.

1313
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,109
Oh, look at this.

1314
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:54,110
Isn't it ugly?

1315
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,109
(laughs)

1316
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,110
HOLLIS:
Ooh, I like this.

1317
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,130
Holly for my Hollis.

1318
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,620
You know how I got my name?

1319
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,129
It's... it's, uh...

1320
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:12,629
a real place...

1321
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:15,629
in Queens.

1322
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:17,630
That's where they found me.

1323
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,650
Just an hour old.

1324
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,640
And look at you now.

1325
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:24,140
Oh! Oh.

1326
01:24:24,141 --> 01:24:28,649
Sit down and close your eyes.

1327
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:30,650
Close them.

1328
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:35,650
No peeking.

1329
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,160
Okay?

1330
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,160
Okay.

1331
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:54,169
It's from Santa.

1332
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:56,670
Oh.

1333
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:03,680
It's beautiful.

1334
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,179
She has your long giving arms

1335
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,690
and your beautiful wild hair.

1336
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,190
You think she looks like you?

1337
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,210
She's not as tough.

1338
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,700
Wish you could see
yourself the way I do.

1339
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:29,709
Oh, you close your eyes now.

1340
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,710
Oh...

1341
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:34,710
They're closed.

1342
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,220
Okay.

1343
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:45,720
Open.

1344
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,229
Oh...

1345
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:56,730
That's you and Bea.

1346
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:02,739
You've made us look
so young and glamorous.

1347
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,740
Oh, I miss Bea.

1348
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,240
I know.

1349
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:09,250
She remembers things for me.

1350
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:19,270
I forget things, Hollis.

1351
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:27,260
Sometimes things seem
so clear and then...

1352
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:34,770
I'm scared.

1353
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:38,270
Never been sick
a day in my life.

1354
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,279
You're not sick.

1355
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,780
Everyone forgets stuff
sometimes.

1356
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,290
It's more than forgetting.

1357
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:59,300
I don't think I can
take care of you anymore.

1358
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,800
But I love you.

1359
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,810
I love you, too.

1360
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:16,310
But I need to go home.

1361
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:25,820
The river's nice,
but I need my ocean.

1362
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:30,340
Okay.

1363
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:36,830
We'll go home tomorrow.

1364
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,359
Ready to go?

1365
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,360
Almost.

1366
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:04,860
Josie?

1367
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,860
What?

1368
01:28:05,861 --> 01:28:09,869
Did you...

1369
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:11,869
did you board that up?

1370
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:14,870
No.

1371
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:19,879
That was...

1372
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,379
uh...

1373
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,879
that was a friend.

1374
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,379
What friend?

1375
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,379
Oh, you just missed him.

1376
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:28,380
Oh. Uh...

1377
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:32,889
Oh, he... he left...
he left you something.

1378
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,390
A candy bar.

1379
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,399
Steven!

1380
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,900
Wait!

1381
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:51,909
Why are you running away?

1382
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,409
Why didn't you let me
know you were here?

1383
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:55,909
I didn't want to scare you off.

1384
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:58,410
Last time you saw Dad,
you told him to take

1385
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:59,919
a flying hike.

1386
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,919
I messed up everything.

1387
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,419
For you and Izzy and John.

1388
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:07,920
Hollis, you are so thick
sometimes.

1389
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:10,440
How did you know I was here?

1390
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:12,930
Ms. Reilly called us.

1391
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:15,930
Edna.

1392
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:17,430
She said you were
a missing person.

1393
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,445
She was hoping we'd
know where you were.

1394
01:29:20,446 --> 01:29:22,939
I told Dad you'd be right here
at the cabin.

1395
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:26,439
Did he listen? No.

1396
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,949
He went to Long Island
with Edna to find you.

1397
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:31,950
Edna and John are out
looking for me?

1398
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:35,449
I missed you, Holly.

1399
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:39,459
I missed you, too.

1400
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,459
I missed all of you.

1401
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,460
Well, then can we let the folks
know what's going on?

1402
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:49,969
Are you ready for this?

1403
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:51,970
She's gonna freak.

1404
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:56,969
IZZY:
Hello?

1405
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:57,970
Hey, Mom, it's me.

1406
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,990
Can you drive out
to the cabin right away?

1407
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,979
The cabin?
What's going on at the cabin?

1408
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,479
Are you okay?
No, no, Mom, Mom.

1409
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:04,480
I'm fine.

1410
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,480
Is the cabin okay?

1411
01:30:05,481 --> 01:30:06,980
Yes, the cabin's fine, too.

1412
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:09,989
So is Hollis.

1413
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,990
(loud):
Oh, my gosh!

1414
01:30:10,991 --> 01:30:12,989
Hollis? You're with Hollis?
Is she okay?

1415
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,490
(giggling)

1416
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,000
Holly.

1417
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,499
I'm really sorry.
I know I should've asked...

1418
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,000
No, no, no, no.

1419
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:30,009
It's okay.

1420
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:33,010
Everything's okay now.

1421
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:37,009
Is it all right if I come home?

1422
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:39,519
Are you kidding me?

1423
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,520
Of course you're coming home.

1424
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,020
I'd like you to meet
my best friend.

1425
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,019
Okay.

1426
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:48,020
She's inside.

1427
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:53,529
So you're gonna be here
and Hollis and who else?

1428
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,529
Um, Steven and my husband John.

1429
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:58,030
I told you about John.
Edna, you know Edna.

1430
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,550
JOSIE:
So we'll all
be here together

1431
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,040
and it should be lovely.

1432
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:02,539
That's right, we'll
have a little party.

1433
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,539
I don't know why
I don't do this more often.

1434
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,540
Ms. Reilly and Dad are here.

1435
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:09,055
Oh, great, that's my husband

1436
01:31:09,056 --> 01:31:11,050
I told you about
and Edna.
Oh, yes. And Edna.

1437
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:21,559
Hey.

1438
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,560
Oh, Hollis.
I missed you so much.

1439
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:32,569
I have something
I want to say to Edna.

1440
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,570
Okay.

1441
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:51,090
Thank you.

1442
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,100
(indistinct conversation)

1443
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:13,609
Henry's been my buddy
for a long time.

1444
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:16,109
Nice fire, Dad.
Haven't you, Henry?

1445
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:18,110
Your eyes match.

1446
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,619
Oh, that's awesome.

1447
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:22,619
Hey, could you make one of me?

1448
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:25,619
Oh, well, these things
take time, you know.

1449
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:28,120
I love this tree.
Me, too.

1450
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:29,640
(cell phone rings)
Oh, hang on.

1451
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:32,630
Excuse me.

1452
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:33,630
(ringing continues)

1453
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:37,630
Hello?

1454
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,640
BEA:
Hey, is Josie there?

1455
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,139
Yes, she is right here.

1456
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,139
They both are, and they're fine.

1457
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,639
Good.
May I talk to her?

1458
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,139
Josie...

1459
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:49,650
I have someone here who
wants to talk to you.

1460
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:53,149
Oh, well, thank you.

1461
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,649
Hello?

1462
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:56,649
The whole world's been
looking for you.

1463
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:57,650
Beatrice?

1464
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,159
Where are you?

1465
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:00,160
I'm on my way.

1466
01:33:00,161 --> 01:33:03,659
And I think it's time
we lived together again,

1467
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:05,159
like we did when we were kids.

1468
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,659
That sounds nice.

1469
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:09,669
Only this time we each get
our own rooms.

1470
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:10,670
Crazy Bea.

1471
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:12,669
Who's with you now?

1472
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,669
Oh, I'm with Hollis and, uh...

1473
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:16,670
let's see, uh...

1474
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:20,179
Oh, I don't know, Bea, but they
seem like very nice people.

1475
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,180
How's your Christmas?

1476
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,180
Oh, we had a good Christmas.

1477
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,680
But Henry and I are ready
to come home now.

1478
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,179
Well, I can't wait.
I'll see you tonight.

1479
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:28,180
Okay, Bea.

1480
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:29,689
Good-bye.

1481
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:33,189
It's Beatrice.
Was it?

1482
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,690
That was Beatrice.

1483
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:42,699
<i>Josie went home to Bea and
I went home with the Regans.</i>

1484
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,199
<i>It was a very merry Christmas.</i>

1485
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,199
(laughing)

1486
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,709
<i>I have a new last name now--</i>

1487
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:51,709
<i>Hollis Woods Regan--</i>

1488
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:54,709
<i>and I love the sound of it.</i>

1489
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:58,710
<i>I still visit Josie Cahill.</i>

1490
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,719
<i>She doesn't exactly
remember who I am,</i>

1491
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:06,219
<i>but sometimes I see recognition
in her eyes.</i>

1492
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,220
<i>"Hollis," she says,</i>

1493
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:10,229
<i>"you saved my life."</i>

1494
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:16,230
<i>And I always tell her
it was the other way around.</i>
