1
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:52,796
Let me tell you something?

2
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,842
New York is the greatest fucking
city in the world. My city.

3
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:58,889
I was a kid in these streets,

4
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:02,348
I started in a fucking gutter
and made it to the top.

5
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:04,942
This life ends one of two ways

6
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:08,711
dead or in jail. I did both.

7
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:27,099
I made my bones doing a piece
of work for Don Carlo Gambino.

8
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:30,769
I don't need to tell you
what happened. You know.

9
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:33,022
But the Commission is moving.

10
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:37,818
The families will not allow
this type of crime to go unchecked.

11
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:40,145
I mean Carlo,
he paid the kidnappers

12
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:43,449
he complied with every demand.
And how did they respond?

13
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:46,092
By leaving the kid
in a fucking dumpster.

14
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:50,775
Now, each of the families
is organizing a team

15
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,083
to head the hunt for the kidnappers.

16
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:56,299
But as far as I'm concerned,
this is the Gambino matter.

17
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:59,673
And we will not fucking stand down,
this is our responsibility.

18
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:04,261
So John, I want you to
head the Gambino team.

19
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:08,432
We are not only doing this for Carlo,
we're doing this for the whole family.

20
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,709
I understand.

21
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:13,544
I want you to take
care of this for me.

22
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,973
It would be an honor.

23
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,800
Consider it done.

24
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:35,960
Oh Jesus Christ.
Look at these fucking bums.

25
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:39,737
- Missy, hit me again, will ya?
- Whiskey nib, coming right up.

26
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:06,222
James McBratney?
You're under arrest.

27
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:14,939
I guess somebody better
call the cops now huh?

28
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:27,243
Let's go.

29
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:32,446
Come on, don't fuck up! Hey!

30
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,518
Down, not a word.

31
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,104
After I had a successful
hit on my belt

32
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:41,609
Carlo Gambino opened up the books
for the first time since 1957.

33
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:44,635
And like that I became the made man.

34
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,749
Can you believe the way
they bring me in here?

35
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,770
Like I'm Hannibal the fucking
cannibal or something.

36
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:22,149
I got the trifecta. I got
jaw, neck and throat.

37
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:26,570
They took my tit and put it on my face.
I do one-armed push-ups.

38
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,607
Cause the took the whole chest muscle out.

39
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,176
Fucking butchers.

40
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,496
My body betray me John,
but not my mind.

41
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,540
And not my heart.
That will never happen.

42
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:42,944
I'm still here, John. I'm still
motherfucking these guys at every turn.

43
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,717
So,

44
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:50,302
what's up?

45
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:54,366
You ordered me a visit. I thought at
least I would make me get a phone call,

46
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,190
but the judge insisted
I get the visit.

47
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,479
John, they didn't do it inside
the kindness of the heart.

48
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:04,423
So, I'm gonna ask you again. What's up?

49
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:14,350
I am thinking about taking a plea.

50
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:19,564
A plea?

51
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:26,589
And are their expectations
of you and this plea?

52
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:32,887
- Five and a half to seven years.
- Five and a half or seven, which is it?

53
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:36,557
Look, I don't want you should stay in
prison one motherfucking more day.

54
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:40,019
I'd rather have this cancer
that you'd have a cold.

55
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:42,423
But I'm telling you if I robbed a church,

56
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:43,984
and I had the stipple sticking

57
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:45,733
out of my ass, I would deny it.

58
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:46,942
I know, daddy.

59
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:52,263
OK, so I'm telling you as a father,
not as a boss, but as a father

60
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:56,202
if you say you're
innocent, I believe you.

61
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,967
So why would you stand up in
front of these motherfuckers

62
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:01,248
and say that you guilty.
Why would you do that?

63
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:03,637
Because if I take this plea, it's over.

64
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:06,921
They are not gonna keep coming after me,
or more charges.

65
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:11,884
- I'll get closure.
- Closure?

66
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:14,949
Let me make sure, I heard that straight?
Closure?

67
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:17,598
What kind of a
milli-mouthed word is that?

68
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:20,893
This is a word for

69
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:24,326
over educated,
under intelligent motherfuckers.

70
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:27,358
This is not a word
that's in my vocabulary.

71
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:29,575
My boys are still young kids, dad.

72
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,572
If I take this plea, I'm back with
them before they are teenagers.

73
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:36,145
If I lose at trial, I'm doing 20 years.

74
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:37,993
Like they never had a father.

75
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:39,273
She's a nice woman.

76
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:42,540
She's a nice woman now,
cause she's dying in cancer.

77
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:45,256
Two weeks ago, everybody hated her.

78
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,504
Now she is Miss Popularity.
I'm just saying.

79
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:50,808
- When is Halloween?
- Next week.

80
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:52,916
Next week, this week, what do I know?

81
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,136
Everyday is Halloween in this place.
What are you going to be?

82
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,975
Officer Mike down the block is gonna lend
me his police dress. I'm going as a cop.

83
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,198
What's the matter with you?

84
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,046
- What me?
- What are doing with my son?

85
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,432
Oh now, it's your son alone.
Cause of you, I'm a lonely.

86
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:08,512
Let me tell you something.

87
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,524
No kid of mine is going to
be a cop for Halloween,

88
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,766
and that's it.
That's not gonna happen.

89
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,990
He's just a kid, today he wants to
be a cop, tomorrow an astronaut.

90
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:18,613
If I ever hear that you let
my son or any of my kids,

91
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:21,954
and you for that matter,
talk to that cop or any cop, I'll kill you.

92
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:26,709
- Relax. He's just being nice to your son.
- Don't make me repeat myself Victoria.

93
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:30,581
And you, you don't dress like a cop.
You don't act like a cop.

94
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:32,488
You don't talk like a
cop, you understand me?

95
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:38,226
- What's the matter with you?
- Me? What's the matter with you?

96
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,575
Don't star Victoria OK?
I'm not in the mood.

97
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,196
Don't talk to me like that.

98
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,469
You think you're such a tough guy. Do you
know, what you're doing to this family?

99
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,792
You are gonna kill me?
I'd like to see you try.

100
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:50,660
Don't get smart with me. Now...
look, what you wanna be?

101
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:53,360
Would you ask him, what he wants
to be instead? What do you wanna be?

102
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:54,902
A baseball player?

103
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,363
No, no, you don't wanna
be a baseball payer.

104
00:08:56,387 --> 00:09:00,162
Why don't you be Casper the ghost?
You put a sheet over.

105
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:01,619
"Casper is for five years old."

106
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:03,517
What was you?
Who was you last year? You were a

107
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,858
princess last year. Right?
And what was you... You was...

108
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:07,294
Time is out, Gotti.

109
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,526
Ah! Gotta go.

110
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,671
- I love you.
- Love you too!

111
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:17,384
After being IDed by the barman,
they sent me to Green Haven Penitentiary

112
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:20,912
where I served 2 years
of the 4 years sentence.

113
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:45,655
With the guards on my back pocket,

114
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,024
I was able to get medical payroll
to see the family dentist.

115
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:04,997
Not a cavity inside, Mr. Gotti.
We'll see you next time.

116
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,306
And while I was at it, I was able to clean
up some unfinished McBratney business.

117
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,194
Remember what I used
to tell you as guys

118
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:33,938
it was me, Angelo and Frankie.

119
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:37,450
We said we was going out of town,
and we'd have a construction job

120
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:40,694
we was gonna build this big wall,
that was gonna take 2 years.

121
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:43,971
Do you remember?

122
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:49,370
John, I want what's best
for you and your family.

123
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:53,666
Then the idea, just one day you'll
be in a prison, made me sick.

124
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,174
But I don't know what makes me sicker,
you being in prison

125
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:58,735
or you bowing to these
pieces of shit.

126
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,463
What bowing?

127
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,333
There is no bowing.
It's a compromise.

128
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:03,759
They get their pint of flush,
I get my peace of mind.

129
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,554
The peace of mind that one day,

130
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:08,973
I'll be there for my family when I need it.
That's what this is.

131
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:11,223
How can you be so naive?
Once they get

132
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:14,478
you laid, you will never be free again.
Do you understand?

133
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,477
They say you win this time,
but next time, they'll

134
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,566
- make sure that you don't.
- There won't be a next time.

135
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,316
I have always felt in my
heart that the day would come

136
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,654
when my family and I
get separated by prison.

137
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:28,409
I am just thankful that it isn't for life.
And this plea will ensure that.

138
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:33,122
I had high hopes for Johnny boy. Me, I
was born with 4 fucking sis to my name.

139
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:35,916
Now I got a kid, going to the
New York military academy.

140
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,797
Johnny boy. Come on.
Let's go, we ain't got all day.

141
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,799
What's the matter? You
guys look like your

142
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,926
brother's going to electric chair.
Cheer up.

143
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,305
Why don't you go get some ice cream?
Pizzas!

144
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,464
- I don't like ice cream.
- You love fuzz sticks, get that.

145
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:53,698
I do not like pizza either.

146
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:56,133
How about the movies,
what's that movie you like

147
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,711
so much?
About spaghetti, meatballs or something.

148
00:12:58,735 --> 00:12:59,481
Go see that.

149
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:02,718
Come on, we ain't got whole day.

150
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,911
Alright, guys, come here.

151
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:10,196
Alright, you guys better not get
into any trouble while I'm gone.

152
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,827
Look out for your
brother, alright?

153
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:14,421
Alright, enough, enough!
Let's go.

154
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:17,458
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Ma! Ma! I gotta go!

155
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:18,797
Hey

156
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,004
Please I gotta go.

157
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:22,838
I made you a Tunasandwich,
for the road.

158
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:26,491
You know what? You're gonna
see him this weekend.

159
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:37,346
At my house, more often or
not, was Angelo Ruggiero.

160
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,605
My best friend
since we was kids.

161
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:40,746
Hey, Ang.

162
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,151
Hey. He up yet? You talk
to him, I have tried.

163
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,367
Hey, uncle Ang.

164
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,143
Hey! Whoa! You know
what's good for you?

165
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:50,247
You don't let your
dad see the cop car.

166
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,309
Come on, you fucking prick.

167
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:56,145
Look at this. Come on.

168
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:57,938
Oh, motherfucker!

169
00:13:58,273 --> 00:13:59,667
You know what fucking time it is?

170
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:01,293
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

171
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,337
I got 6 tons of Buffalo,
they killing us. 10 to nothing.

172
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:06,572
I put 6 dimes on the winger,
they killing us.

173
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,699
I put 6 dimes on the
Chicago, they are losing.

174
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,839
And now I put 3 dimes on
Kansas city, they are

175
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:13,431
winning. But they'll fucking
blow it, motherfucker!

176
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,926
Maybe you should hang yourself,
leave all your troubles behind.

177
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,185
Smart ass. Listen, you wouldn't believe
how much I lost last week.

178
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,604
- I don't wanna believe. Don't wanna know.
- Just once...

179
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:23,922
I would give my fucking life, just to have
The Redskins win once.

180
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:25,853
I got a Redskin named Willi boy in the car.

181
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:29,262
I gotta clean up. Motherfuckers!

182
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,307
- Uncle Angelo, look.
- What do you got there Frankie?

183
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,185
Oh! No you didn't?
You straight A's?

184
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,730
You straight A's? I never
seen anything like this.

185
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:41,649
Hey Frankie boy, did you show
Uncle Angelo your report card?

186
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:43,836
Can you believe that? My
son is a goddamn genius.

187
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,839
My Frank is gonna be a rocket scientist.
What do you think about that Ang?

188
00:14:46,863 --> 00:14:48,199
Let's go. I won't be home for dinner.

189
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:49,884
What are you talking about?
It is Sunday night...

190
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:52,178
What? I gotta repeat myself? I'm
not coming home for dinner.

191
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:54,787
- Johnny it's family night?
- I'll make it up to this.

192
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:59,500
Manhattan's Garment District has
long been the central to the

193
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:01,231
Mafia portfolio of lucrative rackets,

194
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:04,588
and a hugely profitable adjunct
to the mob's historic stranglehold

195
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:07,008
on trucking and laboring unions.

196
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:11,095
Authorities believe that, this
man, John Gotti, a feared captain

197
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,407
in the Gambino family
is the mobster primarily in control of the

198
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:18,018
extortion, corruption
and robbery

199
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,938
with in the multi-million dollar New York
fashion industry.

200
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:23,323
Gotti, is perceived as
the up incomer in the

201
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,878
Mafia, organized crime
family considered...

202
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:28,862
Johnny boy was tough.
He knew how to handle himself.

203
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:31,170
I told him to tell
anybody who had a balls

204
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:33,594
to ask what his father
did for a living,

205
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,748
that I was a 24 hours 7
days a week street guy.

206
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:37,830
Who the fucking god think he is?

207
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:40,457
He is Greek. He doesn't
have his head screwed up.

208
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,417
He has got off the boat yesterday.

209
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:45,504
Who gave him permission to
run pock in Howard Beach?

210
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:48,340
- I told him.
- What did you tell him?

211
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:50,759
How the fuck does he have
a phone talking about me?

212
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,053
My name!

213
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:56,349
He says he's with the Greek Mafia, the
smoke is so full of shit, it ain't funny.

214
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,975
Miss Luzio, hold up, hold up.

215
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:01,186
Lou... Louie... Go help her.

216
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:02,331
I'll take care of it.

217
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:05,066
Take that shit off your face.
He looks like a hippie.

218
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,484
Why don't you grab 50 % of this?

219
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:09,653
Look, I want this shut
down yesterday.

220
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:13,324
This guy is a nobody, even if he
was a somebody, I don't give a fuck!

221
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,451
- You understood me?
- Okay.

222
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:19,348
Mr. Gotti.

223
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,749
- How are you?
- You still working out?

224
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,436
- Not that much any more.
- Come on, what's the matter?

225
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,463
- He was a quite hope.
- They just fucking closed on Tully's.

226
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:30,234
Tully's an institution? How
long Tully's been around?

227
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:32,843
I have been walking by
Tully's for 40 years.

228
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:35,155
- What happened? What the fuck happened?
- I don't know.

229
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:38,307
The rent's gone up, they got sited for
some code violation or something.

230
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:41,561
Don't you worry. It will
be back in business.

231
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:43,855
How's your father?
How is his liver?

232
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:47,108
He is still here.
He is still here.

233
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,944
You tell him hello
from me, alright?

234
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:52,780
Mr. Gotti. Thank you.

235
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:56,700
I don't give a fuck who it is.

236
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,535
He is using my name on the phone.

237
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:02,873
So you tell this cocksucker, that if
he ever deals another card in Queens,

238
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:05,167
or ever he whispers my name again,

239
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:07,002
I, me, John Gotti,

240
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:09,463
will sever his motherfucking head off.

241
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:15,303
- Put on the ice.
- Ma, I'm good. Ma!

242
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:17,513
OK.
I will fix you something to eat.

243
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,768
Get your feet off the couch.

244
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,437
Get up.

245
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,652
You got suspended, huh?

246
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:33,797
What do you think you're doing?

247
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:37,231
These local kids jumped a couple of our
guys. We was just handling our business.

248
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:39,452
You were handling your business?

249
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:42,496
- I guess.
- You guess?

250
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,123
You show up?

251
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,168
Yeah. I would say so.

252
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:51,338
Attaboy.

253
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:54,216
You stood your ground.
You didn't back off.

254
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:57,260
You never back off.
You always stand up. You fight,

255
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:58,971
till you can't fight no more,

256
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:01,473
never take backward step ever.

257
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:04,602
Dad, I'm thinking maybe I don't wanna
try for West Point anymore.

258
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:08,147
- Maybe, I could take a year off.
- Take a year off?

259
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:10,483
Drop by to school, not
go to college,

260
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,110
become a bum on the street...

261
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:13,253
which one?

262
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:19,408
What are you thinking?

263
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:24,371
You wanna hang out with me?

264
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:26,039
Is that what you're thinking?

265
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,667
Jesus Christ...

266
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,506
Booch, I'm hungry!

267
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:44,467
They get it, if they are good.

268
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:47,812
Well, they get what they get paid.
A lot of them are bummers.

269
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:49,563
That's for sure.

270
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:55,611
The Lucchese is here.

271
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:00,115
I don't like that guy.

272
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,492
Which one?

273
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:04,203
His name is Gas pipe.

274
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:05,954
Yeah, I heard him.

275
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:07,247
He is trouble.

276
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:11,168
He is up in Angelo's face
at the apartment of the 59th street.

277
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:13,086
He is real sick of him.

278
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:16,256
Look at him, this is making sure

279
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:18,383
all families know his name.

280
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:19,843
Prick.

281
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:22,013
Relax. He is not our business.

282
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:25,104
Sweetheart,
could we get another round here please?

283
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:26,170
You got it.

284
00:19:26,194 --> 00:19:29,686
Let me ask you something.
What do you think the Genovese

285
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,813
think of their boss?

286
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:33,523
What are you talking about?

287
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:36,318
I can understand the
whole insanity pleading.

288
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,229
Come on, running around
town in a fucking

289
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:40,138
pajamas, give me a
fucking break...

290
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:43,617
Vincent THE CHIN Gigante,
according to the government,

291
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:46,495
the powerful boss of the
Genovese crime family.

292
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:48,288
To me, he was a rival.

293
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,540
Chin is a very smart guy.

294
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:54,337
He runs his family as he sees fit.
I can tell you this,

295
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:56,342
you'll never see Chin
and his girl in a

296
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,233
place like this. That's
for fucking sure.

297
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:01,658
Well, talking about bosses who hide.

298
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,178
- Don't start.
- Just telling...

299
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,013
He is never here.

300
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:08,684
How can you run a family
if you're not on the ground with them?

301
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,313
Johnny. You got to shut the fuck up.
Paul is your boss.

302
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:14,398
End of fucking story.

303
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:18,944
Who is that guy with Frankie?

304
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:20,570
What's his name again?

305
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:22,280
It's Sammy Bull.

306
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:24,116
That's Sammy. Why Bull?

307
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:27,787
- The bulls hit dead man.
- I know about him.

308
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:29,348
You don't like anybody here tonight.

309
00:20:29,372 --> 00:20:31,234
I just don't like what
I hear about him.

310
00:20:31,258 --> 00:20:32,684
OK? That's all I'm saying.

311
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,001
He is a good earner.
And he's Frankie's guy.

312
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,188
He never done time.

313
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:39,256
I don't trust anybody, who never done time.

314
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,007
He's our friend now.

315
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:43,385
Hey listen, you trust
Frankie, don't you?

316
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:46,571
Frankie would vouch to the fucking oomph
for this kid. We gotta give him a chance.

317
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:47,256
Here they come.

318
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,516
Hey boys.

319
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:51,268
How you doing tonight?
Hey, Johnny.

320
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:52,371
How you doing, Neil?

321
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,645
How are you, Sammy?

322
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:55,022
Hey, Frank.

323
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,334
Sammy, I would like to meet,

324
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:59,568
a good friend of ours and
a dear friend of mine,

325
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:00,945
John Gotti.

326
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:04,824
How you doing John?
Heard a lot about you from Frankie.

327
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:06,385
Good to finally meet.

328
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,011
- Well, good, I hope.
- Of course it's good.

329
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:09,346
I'm gonna talk about my brother.

330
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,580
Let me tell you something.
Time with Lewisburg

331
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:13,999
will make a man out of you.
OK. Am I right Frankie?

332
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,794
You come out of the Tick N the Tips.

333
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,380
Brother Johnny.

334
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:22,215
Let's raise a glass
to our new friend.

335
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:24,009
- Salud.
- Salud.

336
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:25,886
Neil...

337
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,304
Frankie...

338
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,311
You trust this kid?

339
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,693
Thank you.

340
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:47,324
We walked together and
we fall together.

341
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:48,993
This is the life.

342
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:51,953
I chose my side over
40 years ago.

343
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:53,450
The hardest thing in
this world for me to do

344
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:55,029
would be to have to say
goodbye be to my kids.

345
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:56,569
- I can't do it.
- I don't want you to,

346
00:21:56,593 --> 00:21:58,604
I don't want you have
to lie to your kids.

347
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:00,939
And you tell them you are out
on some construction job.

348
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:03,424
You and me, job, we never
had to lie to each other.

349
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:05,800
But it's the lies that
you tell yourself,

350
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:07,678
these are the lies you gotta live with.

351
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:13,058
You are missing your kids?
You think that's bad?

352
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:15,102
Do I really have to say it?

353
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:17,146
Do I?

354
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,028
Frankie...

355
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:27,155
No, leave the light on.

356
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:30,409
- Frankie, we are just down.
- Oh, leave the light on. Kids

357
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:31,952
are scared of the dark.

358
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:34,330
- This till John gets back?
- Till John gets back.

359
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:38,583
Good night, Frankie. Love you.

360
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,503
- See you tomorrow.
- I love you.

361
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:58,986
Oh God, no, Frankie, Frankie.

362
00:23:58,998 --> 00:24:01,667
- I did not see him.
- Frankie.

363
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:05,061
Mommy is here.
Oh, Frankie. Mommy's here.

364
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:09,717
The sun has blinded.

365
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:11,969
Mommy's here. Stay wake.

366
00:25:44,437 --> 00:25:47,314
Johnny boy, it was an accident.

367
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:50,025
It was an accident. It happened.

368
00:25:50,443 --> 00:25:51,735
He is gone.

369
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:54,446
But he will always
be your brother.

370
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:55,738
Now, you listen to me.

371
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:58,032
I want you to be strong, okay?

372
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,742
I'm proud of you.

373
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:02,370
We gotta do this for your mother.
Go ahead.

374
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:04,123
Come on.

375
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,504
Come here.

376
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:12,047
Come here.

377
00:26:13,257 --> 00:26:14,507
Come here.

378
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:16,260
Come here.

379
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:26,907
Come on, I'm late.
What the hell are you waiting for?

380
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:37,840
- What are you doing?
- Frankie is cold.

381
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:40,761
- He needs a blanket. No!
- Come here.

382
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:42,846
Come here.

383
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:46,225
It will be fine. Come here.

384
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,227
It will be fine.

385
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:53,439
Calm down, Vicky. Calm down.

386
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,485
I need to go. I must.

387
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,571
Listen to me, listen to me.

388
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:01,406
I need to go.

389
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:03,783
I have to bring him a blanket.

390
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,494
He is cold!

391
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:24,971
What happened? Is Vicky OK?

392
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:26,681
This piece of shit Favara.

393
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:28,892
She smacked him around with a baseball bat.

394
00:28:29,018 --> 00:28:30,476
She's gonna be alright.

395
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,228
He's a stupid fucking asshole, John!

396
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:34,272
He never fixed the dent in a car!

397
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:37,860
He leaves it there even in the driveway,
day after day for Vicky to see.

398
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:40,904
John, we can't know why

399
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,697
God lets these things happen,

400
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:45,200
but there has to be a reason.

401
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:46,743
A reason?

402
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:48,453
For these things?

403
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:51,873
He was 12 years old. He didn't
have a hair in his prink.

404
00:28:51,874 --> 00:28:54,751
There ain't no fucking reason.
There ain't no fucking God.

405
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:57,087
Don't say another word.

406
00:29:02,134 --> 00:29:05,679
I'mma take Vicky down to
Florida to see her family.

407
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:08,264
I think, it will be good for us.

408
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:09,850
Clear our heads.

409
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:25,114
On March 12, 1980,

410
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:28,201
12 year old Frank Gotti was riding
his mini bike on this street,

411
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:31,371
157th Avenue,
just 3 blocks from his home,

412
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:35,416
John Favara's car hit 12 year
old Frank Gotti and killed him.

413
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:39,587
The people who know the Gotti they never
came to terms with young Frank's death.

414
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:41,024
Police however believed someone,

415
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:43,341
did come to terms with John Favara.

416
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:46,761
On July 28th, Favara left his job and

417
00:29:46,762 --> 00:29:49,532
walked to his car which was parked
next door at the Capitol Diner.

418
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:52,141
The Diner's owner told Police he saw 3 men

419
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:54,394
clubbed Favara and
shoved him into a van.

420
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:57,438
The best witness Police had
in the abduction of John Favara

421
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:59,941
was Leon Papon, the man who
owned the diner,

422
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:03,362
he had seen the whole thing,
he told that to Nassau County police.

423
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:06,739
But then the assailants returned
to the diner, several days later.

424
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,616
They reportedly ordered coffee

425
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:11,285
and as they Sept it,
they stared at Papon.

426
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:15,666
Right after that, Papon stopped
cooperating with Nassau County Detectives.

427
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,834
His memory of the incident faded.

428
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:20,504
He sold the
diner and moved away.

429
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:29,888
OK, that's it. That's it.

430
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:31,681
That's it.

431
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:32,933
That's it.

432
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:35,602
Vicky...

433
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:37,163
Enough.

434
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:39,647
I love you, but we
got four other kids.

435
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:42,900
We'll never let go of Frankie,
do you understand me? Never.

436
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:44,945
He is in our hearts forever.

437
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,864
For ever. Till the day we die.

438
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:50,575
We are gonna always live like
we are seven.

439
00:30:52,536 --> 00:30:54,413
I'm gonna make you some coffee.

440
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:09,136
Alright.

441
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:11,096
No problem. Merry Christmas.

442
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:17,467
Look at him. That
lousy bastard father

443
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:20,415
turns out to be a good grandpa.

444
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,482
- Who knew?
- You never know...

445
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:25,526
Tell you something,
maybe if we didn't have such crappy parents

446
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:28,154
we would have so much in common.
You understand?

447
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:31,741
Yeah. I would be living in Flat bush
married to a dentist.

448
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:34,702
What are you talking about?
You get a bad tooth

449
00:31:34,703 --> 00:31:37,372
I will happy to knock that
right out of your mouth.

450
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:41,168
There is my smile, there is my girl.

451
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,329
You didn't think you'd be used to having
hundred people around this house, huh?

452
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:48,258
Yeah. One night a
year, I can handle it.

453
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:50,468
Can you believe it?

454
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:53,471
We used to barely have
enough for the two of us.

455
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:55,973
But we had each other.
That's what it matters.

456
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:57,850
That's all it matters.

457
00:31:57,851 --> 00:32:00,561
You and me, we get through this together.

458
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:02,397
We get through anything.

459
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:07,861
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

460
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:12,491
Let me ask you, who is that
guy sitting in my chair?

461
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,695
You've been meaning to ask?

462
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,180
That guy has been in your chair every
Christmas for the last 15 years.

463
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:18,705
For 15 years.

464
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:24,460
Let me get you a drink.

465
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:26,963
- How about a cigar?
- Let's do it.

466
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:28,297
Sammy Gravano told me

467
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:29,317
something.

468
00:32:29,341 --> 00:32:30,925
What did Sammy Gravano say?

469
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:32,448
You was over at
Paul's house just now.

470
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:34,760
Yeah, I was at
Paul's house just now.

471
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:38,850
- Did you see Sammy there?
- No. I just stopped by for 2 minutes.

472
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:43,021
He tells Paul, he says I wanna go see
Neil, wish him a merry Christmas.

473
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:46,649
- Why do I give a shit about all this?
- Paul said:

474
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,545
What the hell you wanna do that for?
You are on our side.

475
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:50,129
And what did Sammy say to that?

476
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:52,572
He said "We are all a family, ain't we?"

477
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:57,243
Sammy told you that?

478
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:58,745
Sammy told me.

479
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:19,975
You need a woman.

480
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:41,245
- Now I know.
- I can not believe.

481
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:42,747
Paul...

482
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:45,333
Paul Castellano was a
fucking fish in the desert.

483
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,168
A fish out of the water.

484
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,128
I never respected Paul.

485
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:51,339
Neil was much more of a boss

486
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,882
that Paul ever was.

487
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:56,010
- Give my regards to Victoria.
- I will, thanks.

488
00:33:56,011 --> 00:33:57,846
She will be glad to hear it.

489
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:18,804
I'm just saying, if Paul goes
to prison for them indictments

490
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:20,929
they're gonna make Tommy
Bilorti the street boss.

491
00:34:20,953 --> 00:34:23,914
Happy days! We're gonna have
hold it to wig business.

492
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:26,540
Neil, what's going on here?

493
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,501
Keeping Paul

494
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:30,563
He's not concerned making the deal with
those other families than his own.

495
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:32,588
He's the boss. End
of fucking story.

496
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,257
Time Magazine says,
you, the boss.

497
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:37,828
Shows you what a disreputable
fucking profession that is.

498
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:40,721
- You know why.
- I tell you why.

499
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:43,474
Because we have never been under
this kind of scrutiny before.

500
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:45,393
They can see you, Neil.

501
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:47,436
- Yeah. Too fucking much.
- No, no, no!

502
00:34:47,437 --> 00:34:51,107
You could see, he could talk man to
man with you. Know what I'm saying?

503
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:54,110
What's Paul's contribution to
society, fucking his

504
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:55,444
Portuguese maid?

505
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:57,655
As long as it keeps him off my back...

506
00:34:57,656 --> 00:35:01,826
Yeah but, 35 years, in the same house
as his wife. I mean, that ain't right.

507
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:06,122
I guess you gotta give him credit.

508
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:08,833
For what? His penile implant?

509
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:10,835
You got his house bugged? Do you?

510
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:13,898
Yeah, I defeated that 50 thousand dollar
security system with my good looks.

511
00:35:13,922 --> 00:35:16,340
That Portuguese maid
was crazy about me.

512
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:19,593
She is Guatemalan.

513
00:35:19,594 --> 00:35:22,615
So, you have seen it? What ever country
she is from they probably made her leave.

514
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,891
I would not fuck her with your dick.

515
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:28,436
Listen. Paul has got diabetes.

516
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:33,107
It's not a subject I feel
comfortable discussing.

517
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:35,060
What the fuck is so fucking funny?

518
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,474
It's hysterical,
we're gonna get a fucking accident.

519
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,954
Oh, look at this place.
What a dump!

520
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:48,539
What are we doing here?

521
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,102
We get a couple of drinks get the fuck
outta here, go get something to eat.

522
00:35:51,126 --> 00:35:54,879
Let's go to "Little Pete", it's got that
shrimp in there. I mean you like this.

523
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,065
It's a cop zone.

524
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:57,734
It's fucking Garry and
his fucking shrimp...

525
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:58,818
How about a little shot, it's on me.

526
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:01,320
- No, we are good. Thanks.
- What the fuck you guys are talking about?

527
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:02,928
I went there the other week.

528
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,555
It's not filled with cops.

529
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:07,166
Do me a favor, take a walk, you
and your fucking mustache.

530
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:09,185
Five cops, last week, heading...

531
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:12,314
- Three shots for me and my boys here.
- We're good, thank you.

532
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:14,904
Hey, you're too good to
have a shot with me?

533
00:36:15,776 --> 00:36:17,652
I said take a fucking walk.

534
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:39,549
Stay down motherfucker!

535
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:44,721
- Connard!
- Fucker!

536
00:36:45,222 --> 00:36:47,014
You motherfucking piece of shit!

537
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:48,475
Little shit!

538
00:36:51,603 --> 00:36:53,563
John, come on! Come on!

539
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:55,982
Fuck!

540
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,410
I didn't give a fuck,
when he came in, I

541
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:07,386
grabbed the ball stool,
I grabbed 2 ball stools

542
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,846
I was going over, I don't give a fuck.
I just kept going.

543
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,349
Oh my God, I was swinging I didn't
know who the fuck I was hitting.

544
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:12,884
You swinged at the wrong guy 3 times.

545
00:37:12,908 --> 00:37:14,185
- No I didn't.
- You kidding me?

546
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:17,128
You hit the wrong kid. He
wasn't even with them.

547
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:25,845
You little motherfucker!

548
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:28,598
Did you have a fight tonight?
Did you?

549
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:32,351
Someone got killed!
Did you know that? Did you?

550
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:35,229
- No I did not know that!
- You shut the fuck up.

551
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,940
You cocksuckers! You
gonna ruin your future!

552
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:39,400
Don't you understand?

553
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:42,445
It's gonna follow you for the
rest of your fucking... life!

554
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:50,620
- Someone got killed?
- Not when I was there.

555
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,083
Proudest moment of his life was watching
you graduate from military school.

556
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:58,044
And now this. You father is crushed.

557
00:37:58,253 --> 00:37:59,879
- You know that?
- I know.

558
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,298
- No! You do not know anything!
- Dad...

559
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:04,466
Now shut up. I will talk to you later.

560
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,926
The sharks are circling.

561
00:38:05,927 --> 00:38:08,554
The cops are gonna shake him down.
And that man's gonna,

562
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:10,222
pay to protect you.

563
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:13,351
I didn't kill the guy!
I will answer for it, anything!

564
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:15,895
- We didn't kill anybody.
- I know that.

565
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,813
But it doesn't fucking matter.

566
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:20,024
You two stupid motherfuckers.

567
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:23,528
You brought a lot of fucking hate down
on this family.

568
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:27,740
Actually, it was Angelo
who put the heat down on the family

569
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:30,826
when the government
released what would become known as

570
00:38:30,827 --> 00:38:33,329
the "Angelo Ruggiero tapes".

571
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,539
They picked up Ang on a wire tap.

572
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,416
Taking about various activities that

573
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:40,836
neither Paul or the
government would've sanctioned.

574
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:42,379
Fucking Ang.

575
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,131
This is ridiculous!

576
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:45,507
You got popped Ang.

577
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,468
Let me just ask you one question.

578
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:50,095
Are you bad mouthing Paul on them tapes?
Are you?

579
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,283
- I don't know, there's hundreds of hours.
- Oh come on!

580
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:55,267
- What? You don't know nothing?
- They bugged my daughters'.

581
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:56,787
What were you saying on the tapes?

582
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:58,951
I said a lot of things
that could get a lot of

583
00:38:58,975 --> 00:39:01,232
people in a lot of
trouble. It's what I said.

584
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,150
My friends are on those tapes.

585
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:04,587
Our friends are on those tapes.

586
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:06,779
Neil... OK...

587
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:11,159
If Angelo decides that he's gonna turn
these tapes over to Paul? What happens?

588
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:12,701
- Is that it?
- No.

589
00:39:12,702 --> 00:39:15,288
That is most definitely not fucking it.

590
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:19,291
If Paul wants the tapes,
we gotta get him the tapes.

591
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:22,712
He's the boss. Boss is the boss is
the boss, that's the Cosa Nostra.

592
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,673
Tell me I don't know
something about it, please!

593
00:39:25,674 --> 00:39:28,175
If it was just some fucking asshole,

594
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:30,613
getting called out of some Joe,
he know I would authorize the

595
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:32,805
handover in a second.

596
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:35,641
- But this is our friends.
- Look...

597
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:37,935
If the government has a case,

598
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:40,396
Paul will find out when it comes to trial,

599
00:39:40,397 --> 00:39:43,408
because it will be matter of public record.
You are fucked either way.

600
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:45,276
We are fucked.

601
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:48,112
OK. We are fucked either way.

602
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:00,875
No no, that's not gonna happen. Get
it out of your head right now.

603
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:07,673
Listen...

604
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:11,802
You know, Paul doesn't give
2 fucks about me or you,

605
00:40:11,803 --> 00:40:13,721
He shit picks over his fucking case.

606
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:15,116
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about?

607
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,308
Ang, just shut the fuck up, will you?

608
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,435
You got us into this mess.

609
00:40:19,436 --> 00:40:22,647
- Please.
- Get the fuck out of here, Ang. Go on.

610
00:40:33,783 --> 00:40:35,577
Christ almighty...

611
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:38,662
I ain't saying you're wrong.

612
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:40,790
But what do you want me to tell Paul?

613
00:40:40,915 --> 00:40:45,127
Ang is saying to the boss, "Fuck you! I
don't wanna handover those fucking tapes!"

614
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:47,714
I've been trying to make
this thing go away, but...

615
00:40:48,256 --> 00:40:50,133
Paul keeps bringing it up.

616
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:53,678
Unless I say it to him, Fuck you!
Go fuck yourself!

617
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:56,430
And then, you know,
we gotta do then...

618
00:40:56,431 --> 00:40:58,640
We roll a mother, we go to war.

619
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:02,645
That's right. We gotta do what we gotta do.
We strike him before he gets to us.

620
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:07,649
What?

621
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:09,943
- What's the matter, you OK?
- Yeah.. no.

622
00:41:09,944 --> 00:41:12,822
- What do you need?
- It will pass.

623
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,574
It's funny.

624
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:18,744
All these fucking tapes
and trials...

625
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:20,496
We spend all these time trying

626
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:23,290
to stay one step
ahead of the game...

627
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,668
But this fucking cancer...

628
00:41:26,878 --> 00:41:29,213
And it's the ultimate fuck you.

629
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:39,432
I'm really not painted.

630
00:41:47,524 --> 00:41:49,400
You got something for me?

631
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:51,462
You see this kid here?

632
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:53,714
Used to give him 5 dollars,
he went to candy store.

633
00:41:53,738 --> 00:41:56,741
Now look at him, he's a fucking earner.

634
00:41:57,575 --> 00:42:00,244
Here.
Buy yourself a nice sports jacket.

635
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:03,288
Because we are going to Binge tonight.

636
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:04,707
Tonight, tonight.

637
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,970
I'mma tell you something
about your old man.

638
00:42:09,546 --> 00:42:12,215
When he was sent off to Green
Haven on the McBratney thing,

639
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,174
which you probably know about

640
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:16,636
Carlo Gambino was so
grateful to your father

641
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:19,305
for his service to him...

642
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,600
He got him Roy
Cohn to defend him.

643
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:26,729
Roy Conh, the biggest fucking
lawyer in the country.

644
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:30,149
Your dad wasn't even a
main man at that time.

645
00:42:30,275 --> 00:42:32,401
Cohn, he makes a deal into plea...

646
00:42:32,402 --> 00:42:35,404
He gets it reduced to involuntary
manslaughter. And your dad's

647
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:36,549
out in four.

648
00:42:36,573 --> 00:42:39,283
One of our people who know about this,

649
00:42:39,284 --> 00:42:42,078
how your dad going to
arrested in the first place.

650
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:44,746
Your dad was lying low,
in the wind,

651
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:47,117
he has to have this problem
with the Genovese family.

652
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,394
He showed up.

653
00:42:48,418 --> 00:42:51,879
He receded up my behalf at a seat down
near here in Maspeth.

654
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:55,800
And the FBI picket him up on
a tip-off as he was leaving.

655
00:42:57,594 --> 00:42:59,428
Loyalty cuts both ways for them.

656
00:42:59,429 --> 00:43:00,971
Your honor,

657
00:43:00,972 --> 00:43:03,515
the prosecution contains that Mr. Gotti

658
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:05,767
is a clear and continuing
danger to the community.

659
00:43:05,768 --> 00:43:08,356
And in lieu of potential
life sentence in this case

660
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,647
it would be imprudent
to grant him bail.

661
00:43:10,648 --> 00:43:11,750
Thank you, Miss Giacalone,

662
00:43:11,774 --> 00:43:14,736
but you have not convinced me
that Mr Gotti is a flight risk.

663
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,155
Court grants bail on the
amount of one million dollars.

664
00:43:18,156 --> 00:43:21,215
Your honor, as the court has
granted bail for Mr Gotti

665
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:23,012
we also request that there be set

666
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:24,995
at a reasonable amount for Mr.
Johnson.

667
00:43:24,996 --> 00:43:27,290
Your honor, we have strong
reasons to believe

668
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:29,560
that the defendant's life
will be in serious jeopardy

669
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:32,545
- if he is granted bail.
- And why would that be?

670
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:48,102
Because Wilfred Johnson
has been a confidential informant

671
00:43:48,144 --> 00:43:50,396
for the FBI for the past 19 years.

672
00:43:51,189 --> 00:43:53,482
- Order!
- Liar!

673
00:43:53,483 --> 00:43:55,943
- She is lying! I'll fucking kill you!
- Order!

674
00:43:56,903 --> 00:43:59,404
- You're going to kill me!
- You will have order.

675
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:01,574
Counsel, restrain your client.

676
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:07,205
In light of that information if confirmed,
bail is denied on Johnson.

677
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,794
I stand strong...

678
00:44:13,753 --> 00:44:17,840
I refuse to testify
and we win...

679
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:21,803
Can I get a pass? I beg of you.

680
00:44:22,804 --> 00:44:24,472
Swear it.

681
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,641
Swear it on your kid's grave.

682
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:29,602
You won't kill me.

683
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,439
How am I gonna kill a ghost?

684
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:45,576
Me and Willy Boy Johnson
beat the case

685
00:44:45,618 --> 00:44:48,138
due to the lack of credibility
of the government's witness.

686
00:44:48,162 --> 00:44:53,042
Find the defendants John Joseph
Gotti and Wilfred Johnson not guilty.

687
00:44:54,294 --> 00:44:57,630
As for Willy Boy
it's another story.

688
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:02,467
Dominic always took
charge of the fireworks.

689
00:45:02,468 --> 00:45:04,219
He's not kidding.

690
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,681
It's my gift to that.
You do the fireworks the way I like you.

691
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:09,642
That's not what I...

692
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:15,063
- Look.
- I can not believe...

693
00:45:15,064 --> 00:45:17,817
- You would have some fun?
- Let's go have some fun.

694
00:45:19,944 --> 00:45:21,320
Is there a problem here?

695
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:24,174
We are shutting it down Gotti.
This is an un-permitted street gathering.

696
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:25,968
And illegal fireworks at this premises.

697
00:45:25,992 --> 00:45:29,411
What are you talking about?
We've been doing this for 20 years.

698
00:45:29,412 --> 00:45:31,816
Let me ask you something.
You gonna put these good people in jail

699
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,267
because they are
proud of their country?

700
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,667
Is that right? You got
my lawyer on the phone?

701
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:37,479
- He is standing by.
- You got bail money?

702
00:45:37,503 --> 00:45:38,795
With interests.

703
00:45:38,796 --> 00:45:40,298
Send them up!

704
00:45:56,481 --> 00:45:58,691
This is your turf, John.

705
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:08,951
Look at this. I'm good at my deal.

706
00:46:09,452 --> 00:46:10,870
Go ahead, taste.

707
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,709
It's not bad. I know.

708
00:46:20,254 --> 00:46:21,714
Hey. Excuse me.

709
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:24,675
I don't normally do this, but
I saw you walking over.

710
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:28,720
I'd hate myself the rest of my life
if I don't come and talk to you.

711
00:46:28,721 --> 00:46:30,331
Stop it, Johnny, you're not funny.

712
00:46:31,182 --> 00:46:33,369
- Wait, do we know each other?
- What? You lose your memory

713
00:46:33,393 --> 00:46:35,394
at the military academy or something?

714
00:46:36,813 --> 00:46:38,814
It's me. Kim.

715
00:46:39,273 --> 00:46:41,734
Come on John! Joey Rugs' daughter!

716
00:46:42,944 --> 00:46:44,236
I'm sorry. It's just...

717
00:46:44,237 --> 00:46:46,697
You looked different.

718
00:46:47,115 --> 00:46:48,699
Guess I grew up.

719
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:50,743
I guess you did.

720
00:46:54,038 --> 00:46:55,831
You wanna get a beer or something?

721
00:46:56,332 --> 00:46:58,250
John, I'm 16.

722
00:47:00,253 --> 00:47:02,213
You wanna get a soda?

723
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:03,965
Yeah, that sounds nice.

724
00:47:04,298 --> 00:47:05,758
Alright. Let's go.

725
00:47:07,802 --> 00:47:09,345
See you.

726
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:11,555
Joey Rugs...

727
00:47:12,557 --> 00:47:15,601
Paul wants to see you.
And I hold him back as long as I can.

728
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,979
The fucking Angelo Tapes again?

729
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,522
It's got nothing to do with Angelo.

730
00:47:20,523 --> 00:47:22,274
Paul has decided to break up

731
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,567
your crew.

732
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:28,572
He's gonna break up the crew?
The fuck does that mean?

733
00:47:28,573 --> 00:47:29,906
If Paul goes to prison,

734
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:32,637
he wants to make sure
that everybody knows he's still the boss.

735
00:47:32,785 --> 00:47:35,495
It's like Carlo fucking
Gambino all over again.

736
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:37,914
Everyone knows that it
should have been you.

737
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:40,959
What you want and what we get
are 2 different things.

738
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,450
Well, he wants reassurance. Forget
about it. No, he will get it.

739
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:46,150
You better fucking agree with him.
Or at least look like you do.

740
00:47:46,174 --> 00:47:47,591
He doesn't deserve it, Neil!

741
00:47:47,592 --> 00:47:50,677
Look, you gotta earn yours
like we did.

742
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:53,722
- What world are you living in?
- All fucking Paul is

743
00:47:53,723 --> 00:47:55,617
about his money.
That's his get off. That's it.

744
00:47:55,641 --> 00:47:59,383
- Coming from a fucking degenerate gambler.
- You are goddamn right.

745
00:47:59,384 --> 00:48:00,695
Can't take it with you.

746
00:48:07,403 --> 00:48:08,922
If Paul makes a move on Angelo...

747
00:48:08,946 --> 00:48:12,158
You'll live with it.
If he gives you that choice.

748
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:15,244
There is no choice.
There is only what you do.

749
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:18,330
Listen to me.
You kill the boss's boss...

750
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:19,790
I will defend my position.

751
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:22,186
- You will bring down hellfire.
- I'll do what I gotta do.

752
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,754
Not as long as I'm alive.

753
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:29,383
Jesus...

754
00:48:29,926 --> 00:48:33,387
I can't get over Willy Boy.

755
00:48:35,973 --> 00:48:38,309
Shows that life is full of surprises.

756
00:48:39,143 --> 00:48:42,271
He's been with you since
Fulton Rockaway boys huh?

757
00:48:42,939 --> 00:48:45,190
A bunch of punk kids

758
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:47,252
who had the balls to take
on one of my poker game.

759
00:48:47,276 --> 00:48:48,944
You never know.

760
00:48:48,945 --> 00:48:50,779
He broke my fucking heart.

761
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,364
You gave him a pass?

762
00:48:55,451 --> 00:48:58,370
Attack from the outside,
you can deal with.

763
00:48:58,371 --> 00:49:01,791
But attack from the inside...
you're history.

764
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:06,002
Once you take that first step,
there is no turning back.

765
00:49:06,003 --> 00:49:09,965
You either succeed, or you
are lost in enemy territory.

766
00:49:09,966 --> 00:49:12,593
And if you miss, you die.

767
00:49:13,261 --> 00:49:15,346
And all your friends will die.

768
00:49:16,722 --> 00:49:18,933
So you will need DeCicco.

769
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,578
If he is on board, then
Joe Piney would join you.

770
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:25,731
He will take care of the old timers.
And Gallo will go along.

771
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:32,279
"The Lord is my shepherd."

772
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,534
He maketh me to lie down
in the green grass...

773
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:39,953
He leadeth me beside the still waters

774
00:49:39,954 --> 00:49:42,289
he restoreth my soul.

775
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,292
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness

776
00:49:45,293 --> 00:49:47,085
for his name sake.

777
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:51,090
Either I walk through the
valley of shadow of death,

778
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:53,134
I will fear no evil,

779
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:55,636
for thou art with me.

780
00:50:02,226 --> 00:50:04,103
In the presence of my enemies.

781
00:50:22,455 --> 00:50:23,825
In the name of the Father...

782
00:50:24,832 --> 00:50:27,585
Obviously Paul couldn't make it, but
he sends his prayers.

783
00:50:44,644 --> 00:50:46,227
Let me tell you something.

784
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:49,773
Neil could have taken the family
from Paul anytime he wanted.

785
00:50:50,149 --> 00:50:51,442
Everybody knows that.

786
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:54,069
Paul, up on there, the hill.

787
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:57,072
We gotta kiss his ring
like he was the pope.

788
00:50:57,073 --> 00:50:58,365
Fuck pope.

789
00:51:00,076 --> 00:51:03,120
I hear you. I am with you.

790
00:51:14,298 --> 00:51:16,258
You will need DeCicco.

791
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:18,737
If he is on board then
Joe Piney will join you.

792
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:20,846
He will take care of the old timers.

793
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:24,391
And Gallo would go along.

794
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:27,522
D.B. is important he was through
that all the rough ventures and

795
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:30,332
make sure that everybody knows
it's only business we are talking.

796
00:51:30,356 --> 00:51:33,692
But you are gonna need the approval
of the other families.

797
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:37,297
Franck and Sammy Bull
will represent Brooklyn.

798
00:51:37,321 --> 00:51:40,824
The Lucchese won't be a problem.
You got Pescuchi on your side,

799
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:43,618
so the Bonnanos, we
are not worried about.

800
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,037
Leave the Colombos to Angelo.

801
00:51:46,038 --> 00:51:49,583
He will fill the pause with
Freddy DeVico and Benny Cans.

802
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:51,752
And that leaves The Chin.

803
00:51:52,003 --> 00:51:53,295
Chin...

804
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:56,215
Do you think I am
stickler for the rules?

805
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,425
Chin will not be happy no matter what.

806
00:51:58,509 --> 00:52:00,385
But he will be outnumbered so...

807
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:03,304
We could have a peaceful transition
he will just have to accept.

808
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:06,057
I dunno.
Paul and Chin are pretty tight.

809
00:52:06,058 --> 00:52:07,411
They got lot of money on the street.

810
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:09,144
You'll take care of that after.

811
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:11,771
You use D.B. for that...
Now listen,

812
00:52:11,772 --> 00:52:14,607
No body has gotten in on Chin's act.

813
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:17,569
On the contrary, with Paul out of the way,
with Chins

814
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,922
free and clear

815
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:21,656
I have no doubt that the other
families will back you.

816
00:52:21,657 --> 00:52:24,118
But only if you have support
of all five bureaus.

817
00:52:24,368 --> 00:52:27,162
Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan,

818
00:52:27,163 --> 00:52:29,748
Staten Island, the Bronx.

819
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,252
Ain't that a fist?

820
00:52:40,009 --> 00:52:42,010
So it comes down to:

821
00:52:42,011 --> 00:52:43,344
is what you wanna be?

822
00:52:43,345 --> 00:52:47,932
You wanna be on the boss?

823
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,644
Because we are gonna do this thing.
We are gonna do it right.

824
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:53,981
It's gonna be Cosa Nostra,
the Cosa Nostra till I die.

825
00:52:54,732 --> 00:52:56,233
Atta-boys, John.

826
00:52:58,486 --> 00:53:01,322
Paul has set up a
dinner next Thursday.

827
00:53:01,405 --> 00:53:03,032
Friends only.

828
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,536
To discuss the reorganization
of the family.

829
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:17,504
December 16, 1985

830
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,257
We are on a piece of work.

831
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:24,094
It's a big job. There
is no 2 ways about it.

832
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,887
It's gotta be done.

833
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:27,639
Get them their coats and hats.

834
00:53:31,018 --> 00:53:33,186
Hats is all anyone's gonna remember seeing.

835
00:53:33,187 --> 00:53:34,873
We are on the corner
from the United Nations.

836
00:53:34,897 --> 00:53:36,625
They will take the fucking
Russians are coming.

837
00:53:36,649 --> 00:53:39,068
Listen up. Pay attention.

838
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:41,487
We are hitting Paul.

839
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:50,971
And anyone else is in the car with him.

840
00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:04,134
It's gonna take place
at Sparks Steak House.

841
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,476
That's up on 46th, between 2nd and 3rd.

842
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:17,499
He has a 6 o'clock reservation.

843
00:54:17,523 --> 00:54:18,773
At 18 o'clock.

844
00:54:22,361 --> 00:54:23,695
There is gonna be a lot of

845
00:54:23,696 --> 00:54:26,865
Christmas shoppers,
but that's perfect for us.

846
00:54:30,202 --> 00:54:31,972
We are gonna get in and out in a zing,

847
00:54:31,996 --> 00:54:33,997
like the Pittsburgh Steelers.

848
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,876
It's to kill or be killed.

849
00:54:37,877 --> 00:54:39,336
Let's go.

850
00:55:12,036 --> 00:55:13,829
- How you doing?
- Good.

851
00:55:15,748 --> 00:55:17,665
A whiskey and ice please.

852
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,959
So, Franck...

853
00:55:20,085 --> 00:55:22,546
this business with the Gotti's crew..

854
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:25,424
It's very troublesome to Paul.

855
00:55:36,977 --> 00:55:38,854
I know you like John.

856
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:40,813
Hell, I like to.

857
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:42,375
Now that Neil's out of the picture,

858
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:44,026
Paul just wants to...

859
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,904
shake the whole registration.

860
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:01,386
And he wants you to be comfortable with it.

861
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:06,840
Paul is late.

862
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:12,553
Paul is here.

863
00:56:14,556 --> 00:56:16,975
He's not gonna make dinner.

864
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,859
We gotta go.

865
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,177
This assassination of Paul Castellano,

866
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:57,140
has local and federal officials looking for
the men who did it and for the motive.

867
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,907
Finding either are both
extremely difficult,

868
00:56:59,931 --> 00:57:02,080
given the secrecy
of organized crime.

869
00:57:02,104 --> 00:57:05,023
We may never know why
Castellano was killed.

870
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:07,567
Louis Young is standing
by in Staten Island,

871
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:09,361
at the Castellano home.

872
00:57:10,279 --> 00:57:13,323
Mafia kingpin Paul
"Big" Paul Castellano,

873
00:57:13,324 --> 00:57:16,993
was gunned down gangland style
in midtown, Manhattan.

874
00:57:16,994 --> 00:57:19,071
The 70 year old, reputed,
head of the largest and

875
00:57:19,095 --> 00:57:21,206
the most powerful crime
family in the country,

876
00:57:21,248 --> 00:57:22,707
the Gambino family.

877
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:23,893
Uncle Ang?

878
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:25,020
Where is my father?

879
00:57:25,044 --> 00:57:26,980
- He's gonna be here soon.
- Is everything OK?

880
00:57:27,004 --> 00:57:28,421
He is OK.

881
00:57:28,422 --> 00:57:30,132
I learned for Paul.

882
00:57:31,759 --> 00:57:34,260
It would be a terrible
mistake to think that

883
00:57:34,261 --> 00:57:37,889
this is a good time going
around and shooting up people.

884
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,640
He is on a jet,
he's over Iceland

885
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:43,312
and the stewardess comes up and she says:
"My name is Pussy Galore".

886
00:57:43,812 --> 00:57:46,064
He says: "I must be dreaming."

887
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:54,031
Fellas...

888
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,161
We don't know who killed Paul and Tommy.

889
00:57:59,536 --> 00:58:01,163
But we are gonna find out.

890
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,706
Conduct our investigation,

891
00:58:03,707 --> 00:58:05,542
get to the bottom of this.

892
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:07,961
That being said...

893
00:58:09,088 --> 00:58:12,466
our job is now to maintain continuity.

894
00:58:14,176 --> 00:58:17,762
Make sure nobody thinks
family is falling apart here.

895
00:58:17,763 --> 00:58:19,056
So...

896
00:58:20,724 --> 00:58:22,351
I nominate...

897
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,978
John Gotti.

898
00:58:32,611 --> 00:58:34,112
I second the motion.

899
00:58:51,964 --> 00:58:53,214
To the new boss!

900
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,243
Here he is.

901
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:23,912
Congratulations, John.

902
00:59:30,961 --> 00:59:32,421
How does it feel?

903
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:35,882
Feels like times have changed.
It's good.

904
00:59:35,966 --> 00:59:38,050
I mean how does it feel to be here?

905
00:59:38,051 --> 00:59:40,011
This was Neil's joint.

906
00:59:40,012 --> 00:59:41,197
It feels right.

907
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:43,973
It feels like it's what
he would have wanted.

908
00:59:43,974 --> 00:59:46,351
It feels...

909
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:49,521
Wherever he is, he is watching us.

910
00:59:52,232 --> 00:59:53,858
Yeah. And he ain't the only one.

911
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:55,309
I'll talk to you about that...

912
00:59:55,819 --> 00:59:59,030
Nick Vilante's widow lives
upstairs.

913
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:01,365
We can't take her out on the street,

914
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:04,118
but if we have a serious conversation

915
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:07,747
or she whining or it's annoying, we give
a little something,

916
01:00:07,748 --> 01:00:10,208
she vacates the premise for 20 minutes

917
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:12,627
and then we take care of it.

918
01:00:15,923 --> 01:00:18,675
I would like some
to clear the floor.

919
01:00:20,928 --> 01:00:23,597
Let them know.
Let everybody know.

920
01:00:24,848 --> 01:00:27,934
Now, everybody comes to me.
They come to me.

921
01:00:34,525 --> 01:00:35,817
"The new godfather"

922
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:40,655
John Gotti has been the most
note-worthy figure

923
01:00:40,656 --> 01:00:42,073
in the last 50 years.

924
01:00:44,868 --> 01:00:47,995
The head of the Gambino crime
family, a real life godfather.

925
01:00:47,996 --> 01:00:49,872
Shots fired here before the Steak house,

926
01:00:49,873 --> 01:00:51,875
were heard around the world.

927
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:56,921
People shout at me from cars:

928
01:00:56,922 --> 01:00:59,632
"Say hello to John!"

929
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:01,926
The most powerful crime boss in America.

930
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:05,297
Does he glorify the Mafia? Yeah. He's
glorified the Mafia. He's the headhunter.

931
01:01:11,645 --> 01:01:13,461
If I have to go to
another fucking wedding

932
01:01:13,485 --> 01:01:15,464
I think I'd rather go
back to Lewisberg.

933
01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:18,670
Jesus, everybody

934
01:01:18,694 --> 01:01:22,238
have been there. There was good-fellas,
there was non good-fellas.

935
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:24,490
My brother Pete clocked, 75 guys

936
01:01:24,491 --> 01:01:25,783
come up to me.

937
01:01:25,784 --> 01:01:27,994
Those 75 guys come up to talk to me

938
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:30,204
but they got nothing to offer me.

939
01:01:30,205 --> 01:01:32,074
Conversation, if
conversation is the cow it'd

940
01:01:32,098 --> 01:01:34,042
be the fattest fucking guy in in the world.

941
01:01:36,461 --> 01:01:37,796
Jesus...

942
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,263
Rudy?

943
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,865
Can I talk to you a minute?

944
01:01:47,889 --> 01:01:49,182
Yeah, John.

945
01:01:57,482 --> 01:02:00,192
You deliver the envelope
to Dominic's wife yesterday?

946
01:02:00,193 --> 01:02:01,944
Yeah, just like you told me.

947
01:02:01,945 --> 01:02:04,071
No. Not just like I told you.

948
01:02:04,072 --> 01:02:06,532
- I dropped it off.
- Who did you bring with you?

949
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:08,284
Well, I was gonna bring my niece...

950
01:02:08,285 --> 01:02:10,369
But you didn't. You didn't.
One simple rule.

951
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,414
Don't you ever go to a guy's
house while he's away

952
01:02:13,415 --> 01:02:14,915
and see his wife alone.

953
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:16,584
And if you ever do this again,

954
01:02:16,585 --> 01:02:19,879
I'll perk a bus upon your
ass fucking sideways!

955
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,130
You understand that?

956
01:02:21,173 --> 01:02:22,465
Yeah, John.

957
01:02:24,384 --> 01:02:25,844
Sorry, John.

958
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,013
Sorry.

959
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,448
Stay seated.

960
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,494
John's getting too much press.

961
01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:53,496
Ought to learn to duck.

962
01:02:53,497 --> 01:02:55,956
He's got too much pride to duck.

963
01:02:55,957 --> 01:02:58,527
If he don't give a fuck
he's gonna die in jail, the gutter.

964
01:03:00,295 --> 01:03:01,880
Making us look bad.

965
01:03:02,255 --> 01:03:03,924
Then this DeCicco...

966
01:03:04,132 --> 01:03:06,760
We know he arranged the hit on Paul.

967
01:03:07,594 --> 01:03:09,179
That can't go unchecked.

968
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:13,683
Otherwise, we got capos working their
left N right in home.

969
01:03:13,892 --> 01:03:15,852
Not now, not ever.

970
01:03:42,129 --> 01:03:43,505
Frankie!

971
01:03:48,385 --> 01:03:50,345
Frank! Frankie!

972
01:03:59,688 --> 01:04:00,981
Whore!

973
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:12,325
It was meant for you.

974
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:14,077
What are you talking about?

975
01:04:14,286 --> 01:04:17,413
I am telling you it was,
you know who did it.

976
01:04:17,414 --> 01:04:19,666
I heard it on good authority.

977
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:23,711
He and Gas pipe Casso are like
two piece in a fucking pie.

978
01:04:23,712 --> 01:04:26,362
Who heard... You heard! Your ears
are bigger than your mouth.

979
01:04:26,673 --> 01:04:29,091
OK first of all, I'm friends with Chin.

980
01:04:29,092 --> 01:04:31,427
Sam and Pipe go way back, am I right Sam?

981
01:04:31,428 --> 01:04:32,887
Am I right Sam?

982
01:04:32,888 --> 01:04:36,138
What? And they are all grieving about Paul?
Why would they grieve about Paul?

983
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:39,518
Look, whoever killed Paul

984
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:41,562
did everybody a fucking favor.

985
01:04:41,563 --> 01:04:44,500
Maybe it was the cops, yeah, you know.
They put us against each other.

986
01:04:44,524 --> 01:04:47,152
That's what they want us to believe.
Am I right?

987
01:04:47,486 --> 01:04:49,361
Let's take care of business.

988
01:04:49,362 --> 01:04:52,032
Angelo tried to take matters
into his own hands.

989
01:04:52,073 --> 01:04:55,075
With an unsanctioned hit
on Gas pipe Casso.

990
01:04:55,076 --> 01:04:57,120
That didn't workout too well for nobody.

991
01:04:59,706 --> 01:05:01,666
- Gas pipe?
- Who the fuck are you?

992
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,915
Good guys, bad guys,

993
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:45,877
come in many different colors.
New York's finest

994
01:05:45,919 --> 01:05:48,546
serving 2 masters.

995
01:06:19,286 --> 01:06:20,995
I got all day.

996
01:06:22,455 --> 01:06:23,998
I got whole week.

997
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,834
My man, it's just me and you.

998
01:06:26,835 --> 01:06:29,796
We are just, hanging out in the basement.

999
01:06:30,505 --> 01:06:31,881
Just give me a name.

1000
01:06:33,508 --> 01:06:35,176
Tell me who it was.

1001
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:45,478
That hurts, doesn't it?

1002
01:06:48,189 --> 01:06:49,941
I can make it stop.

1003
01:06:51,192 --> 01:06:53,153
I can make it all go away.

1004
01:06:55,405 --> 01:06:56,990
Give me a name.

1005
01:06:57,741 --> 01:06:59,325
Angelo Ruggierio.

1006
01:07:00,744 --> 01:07:02,537
Angelo Ruggierio.

1007
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:03,872
Thank you.

1008
01:07:04,205 --> 01:07:05,665
Thank you very much.

1009
01:07:12,088 --> 01:07:13,590
You handle it,

1010
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,717
Angelo try to whack another
main guy without permission?

1011
01:07:16,718 --> 01:07:18,302
You got no proof of that.

1012
01:07:18,303 --> 01:07:20,262
The shooter need a little encouragement,

1013
01:07:20,263 --> 01:07:23,098
but he told Gas pipe,
he named Angelo.

1014
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:25,517
And there is no reason to disbelief it.

1015
01:07:25,518 --> 01:07:27,603
Do I believe everything I hear?
No!

1016
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:29,897
So I'm gonna do my own
investigation in this.

1017
01:07:29,898 --> 01:07:31,232
Oh yeah?

1018
01:07:31,566 --> 01:07:33,943
How's the other investigation going?

1019
01:07:33,944 --> 01:07:35,838
Heard anything about the
Sparks Steak House?

1020
01:07:35,862 --> 01:07:39,282
Yeah. Their Caesar salad
is to die for.

1021
01:07:40,742 --> 01:07:44,370
Angelo has been asking for this a long
time. There is no dispute about that.

1022
01:07:44,371 --> 01:07:46,080
Let me tell you something Chin.

1023
01:07:46,081 --> 01:07:49,541
Nobody touches Angelo. Nobody.

1024
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:52,086
If it's true that he acted
without my approval,

1025
01:07:52,087 --> 01:07:54,881
I'll put him on a fucking shelf like that.

1026
01:07:54,923 --> 01:07:58,592
I know Angelo's more than a brother to you.
But Angelo went off the record.

1027
01:07:58,593 --> 01:08:00,237
- This was unsanctioned.
- OK. But let me tell you something.

1028
01:08:00,261 --> 01:08:04,014
Life means more than anything to Angelo.

1029
01:08:04,015 --> 01:08:05,391
OK. He is a war horse.

1030
01:08:05,392 --> 01:08:08,228
It means more than it does to you or to me.

1031
01:08:08,687 --> 01:08:10,998
He wakes up thinking about it,
he goes to bed thinking about it.

1032
01:08:11,022 --> 01:08:14,149
If I put him on a shelf for life
it's worse than putting a fucking

1033
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:16,069
bullet through his heart.

1034
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,114
Then I vow to close this matter.

1035
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:22,825
The matter is closed.

1036
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:24,261
The last time

1037
01:08:24,285 --> 01:08:27,413
they moved me John, do you know
the only thing I took with me?

1038
01:08:29,624 --> 01:08:31,750
Your indictment. That was it.

1039
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:35,713
And do you know why I brought it? Because
I don't give a fuck about my cancer.

1040
01:08:35,714 --> 01:08:39,425
I don't care what they do to me in here.
My concerns are you.

1041
01:08:40,218 --> 01:08:41,404
I know that.

1042
01:08:41,428 --> 01:08:44,514
I must have read it 50 times
and I tell you I don't see it.

1043
01:08:45,098 --> 01:08:47,600
I told you once I would
follow you over at cliff.

1044
01:08:47,642 --> 01:08:50,102
And I meant it.
But I am thinking about my family now.

1045
01:08:50,103 --> 01:08:53,731
Your family? What family are you talking
about? You talking about your 400

1046
01:08:53,732 --> 01:08:55,400
brothers, cousins and uncles?

1047
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:59,320
Being a man is not being some guy
who is looking for closure, John.

1048
01:08:59,487 --> 01:09:01,280
My freedom and my life

1049
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:03,366
take a back seat to my duty
and manhood.

1050
01:09:04,034 --> 01:09:05,952
These are my standards, John.

1051
01:09:06,286 --> 01:09:08,829
OK, now listen up. This is important.

1052
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:11,165
Never do anyone a small injury.

1053
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:12,666
You wanna hurt someone,

1054
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:15,836
hurt him so bad
he will never come back at you.

1055
01:09:15,837 --> 01:09:19,340
Neil used to say to me:
"The boss is the boss is the boss."

1056
01:09:20,133 --> 01:09:22,301
It ain't titles that honor men.

1057
01:09:22,302 --> 01:09:24,512
It's men that honor titles.

1058
01:09:47,702 --> 01:09:49,537
What did you do?

1059
01:09:55,835 --> 01:09:59,922
I did what I thought was best for you.

1060
01:10:02,467 --> 01:10:04,135
I save your life Ang.

1061
01:10:04,219 --> 01:10:05,887
I all I can do.

1062
01:10:07,097 --> 01:10:08,514
Son of a bitch killed Frank!

1063
01:10:11,476 --> 01:10:12,976
I am not going to war

1064
01:10:12,977 --> 01:10:15,813
with the Chin for the sake
of Gas pipe fucking Casso.

1065
01:10:16,022 --> 01:10:17,523
I ain't doing it.

1066
01:10:17,941 --> 01:10:19,566
Now listen to you

1067
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:21,930
Just 10 kinds of
shitstorms coming down

1068
01:10:21,954 --> 01:10:24,340
on us and you know
what I had to do?

1069
01:10:24,364 --> 01:10:26,907
We had to have a meeting
with the Commission.

1070
01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:29,827
Why? Because of you. Because of you!

1071
01:10:32,831 --> 01:10:36,000
Every boss wanted you dead.

1072
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:37,543
Everyone.

1073
01:10:39,671 --> 01:10:41,672
You're on the shelf for life.

1074
01:10:41,673 --> 01:10:42,965
That's it.

1075
01:10:43,174 --> 01:10:44,424
Go.

1076
01:11:46,029 --> 01:11:47,047
Get out of here.

1077
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:49,198
Uncle Ang, he needs you.

1078
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:50,843
He made a big fucking mistake.

1079
01:11:50,867 --> 01:11:53,827
Don't say another word. Don't you say
one word against your father.

1080
01:11:53,828 --> 01:11:55,371
You hear me?

1081
01:11:59,209 --> 01:12:00,501
You hear me?

1082
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:15,534
I was forced.

1083
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:18,269
I can not treat him
differently than others.

1084
01:12:18,394 --> 01:12:21,688
If I let you violate my rules,

1085
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:24,859
the very principles that we live by,

1086
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:28,029
it weakens me and that weakens you.

1087
01:12:28,363 --> 01:12:31,491
Now, one day, you may be the shot caller,
you may be the one,

1088
01:12:31,532 --> 01:12:34,146
there is making the rules,
and then you would be responsible

1089
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:37,079
for enforcing those rules.
You know what I'm saying?

1090
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,956
You give me my middle name Angelo.

1091
01:12:38,957 --> 01:12:41,209
How do you expect me to
turn my back on him?

1092
01:12:43,253 --> 01:12:46,923
You pray that I don't know about it.

1093
01:12:49,634 --> 01:12:51,052
I love him too.

1094
01:12:52,387 --> 01:12:53,679
Go to bed.

1095
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,981
Who cares if he goes to see Angelo?

1096
01:13:03,982 --> 01:13:06,233
It's not like John's a part of that life.

1097
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:08,027
Victoria, please...

1098
01:13:08,069 --> 01:13:09,403
Don't start. OK?

1099
01:13:31,843 --> 01:13:33,761
Will the defendant please rise?

1100
01:13:36,889 --> 01:13:38,849
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1101
01:13:41,644 --> 01:13:43,520
"We, the jurors, in the above case"

1102
01:13:43,521 --> 01:13:47,316
"find the defendant, John
Joseph Gotti, not guilty."

1103
01:13:47,734 --> 01:13:50,152
I won this trial
fair and square.

1104
01:13:50,153 --> 01:13:52,863
Thanks to little down payment
to one of the jurors.

1105
01:13:53,072 --> 01:13:56,284
But by 3rd victory over the government,
the media nicknamed me

1106
01:13:56,326 --> 01:13:57,951
"The Teflon God".

1107
01:13:57,952 --> 01:13:58,911
I guess it stuck.

1108
01:13:58,912 --> 01:14:00,537
Mr Gotti, are you the head of the

1109
01:14:00,538 --> 01:14:02,706
- Gambino crime family?
- I'm head of my family.

1110
01:14:02,707 --> 01:14:04,560
Ms Gotti, do you know what your
husband does for a living?

1111
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:06,210
He provides.

1112
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:42,913
- Do you know why we're here?
- No.

1113
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:48,012
- Do you know everybody in this room?
- Yes.

1114
01:14:50,505 --> 01:14:52,256
This is a society of brothers.

1115
01:14:52,632 --> 01:14:54,300
The Cosa Nostra.

1116
01:14:54,342 --> 01:14:56,051
You are now about to be inducted as

1117
01:14:56,052 --> 01:14:58,137
a member of the Gambino family.

1118
01:14:58,763 --> 01:15:01,139
Honor this oath. If you divulge

1119
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:03,850
any secret of
this family, your soul

1120
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:05,268
will burn like this saint.

1121
01:15:05,269 --> 01:15:09,106
Never raise your hands made man.
Or quote with the made man's wife

1122
01:15:09,107 --> 01:15:10,959
you will be killed.
You don't fuck with bums,

1123
01:15:10,983 --> 01:15:13,318
engage the civilians.

1124
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:15,737
Use of drugs, prohibited.
Lastly,

1125
01:15:15,738 --> 01:15:17,490
most importantly
we don't like rats.

1126
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,326
We kill rats.

1127
01:15:21,577 --> 01:15:24,787
You are questioned by law enforcement?
You tell them to go fuck themselves.

1128
01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:27,999
You are now reborn.

1129
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,627
This is your baptism.

1130
01:15:30,086 --> 01:15:31,671
And we are your family.

1131
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:35,383
Come here.

1132
01:16:01,701 --> 01:16:04,077
I would like you to meet your new soldier.

1133
01:16:04,078 --> 01:16:05,579
This is your boss. Your chief.

1134
01:16:09,709 --> 01:16:11,669
This is the proudest moment of my life.

1135
01:16:15,423 --> 01:16:17,675
I am so fucking proud of you.

1136
01:16:22,263 --> 01:16:23,513
Look at us!

1137
01:16:23,556 --> 01:16:24,974
Look at us!

1138
01:16:30,813 --> 01:16:32,064
Hey.

1139
01:16:33,816 --> 01:16:35,359
Come on.

1140
01:16:37,069 --> 01:16:38,362
Hi Elisa...

1141
01:16:45,328 --> 01:16:46,870
Johnny.

1142
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:49,789
Like I said, it's getting tougher.
It's not getting easier.

1143
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:53,418
You look around you. You got a
few good soldiers, am I right?

1144
01:16:53,419 --> 01:16:55,147
- Yeah dad, I think you are right.
- OK.

1145
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:59,007
But this is not the time to make 20 bucks.
You know what kind of guys I need?

1146
01:16:59,008 --> 01:17:01,760
I need guys
that do more than just kill

1147
01:17:01,761 --> 01:17:04,554
I need guys whose hearts
beat the same,

1148
01:17:04,555 --> 01:17:05,931
otherwise, this won't work.

1149
01:17:05,932 --> 01:17:08,934
And the law is coming down hard on us.
You know that.

1150
01:17:08,935 --> 01:17:10,188
Of course, if it comes to worse,

1151
01:17:10,212 --> 01:17:12,164
we could find you a safe house,
get you out of the country.

1152
01:17:12,188 --> 01:17:14,022
I don't run.

1153
01:17:14,023 --> 01:17:15,941
And I don't hide in shadows either.

1154
01:17:15,942 --> 01:17:19,069
You know what I need?
I need one year on the street uninterrupted

1155
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:22,072
and I will build something
that nobody can destroy,

1156
01:17:22,073 --> 01:17:26,535
100 years from now, we are both dead but it
will be and continue to be a good thing.

1157
01:17:27,328 --> 01:17:29,246
Being one hell of a legacy to leave.

1158
01:17:29,247 --> 01:17:32,208
A legacy. Be it
an hour from now, be it tonight

1159
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:35,669
be it a 100 years from now, when we're
gone, it will be the Cosa Nostra.

1160
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:38,232
And I'm not talking about the gangs,
I'm not talking about clans.

1161
01:17:38,256 --> 01:17:42,218
I'm talking about New York, far to
the fucking west coast and back.

1162
01:17:42,343 --> 01:17:44,720
It's gonna be the way
I say it's gonna be.

1163
01:17:48,266 --> 01:17:50,684
About a year after I put him on a shelf

1164
01:17:50,685 --> 01:17:53,395
Angelo Ruggierio died of cancer.

1165
01:17:53,396 --> 01:17:56,356
Ang... I know I hurt you.

1166
01:17:56,357 --> 01:17:58,024
But you've fucked up.

1167
01:17:58,025 --> 01:18:01,570
And I had to do
what was best for the family.

1168
01:18:04,448 --> 01:18:05,740
Frankly,

1169
01:18:05,741 --> 01:18:08,035
I think he died of a broken heart.

1170
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:17,794
By the way, I almost forgot...

1171
01:18:17,795 --> 01:18:21,549
Sammy thinks that you should
be running your own crew now.

1172
01:18:21,924 --> 01:18:24,926
Your credit to your father..

1173
01:18:24,927 --> 01:18:28,764
Normally I don't show you no favor, but
this time, I'mma help you out.

1174
01:18:28,806 --> 01:18:30,974
I'mma hand pick your crew.

1175
01:18:30,975 --> 01:18:34,103
I'mma give you Bobby.
Because I trust him with my life.

1176
01:18:34,437 --> 01:18:36,438
And I trust him with your life.

1177
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:38,815
- Is that okay with Bobby?
- Go ask.

1178
01:18:38,816 --> 01:18:41,484
What? Be under a little punk like you?

1179
01:18:41,485 --> 01:18:43,696
Holy Virgin... never in life.

1180
01:18:44,155 --> 01:18:45,906
It's you, the boss, now.

1181
01:18:46,032 --> 01:18:47,949
You say the word, I will go for a...

1182
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:50,240
You are already hurt, you're
getting married today.

1183
01:18:57,877 --> 01:18:59,336
Yeah. Where is Victoria?

1184
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,302
Hey. Good to see you.

1185
01:19:07,345 --> 01:19:08,637
Congratulations.

1186
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:10,723
Congratulations.

1187
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,933
Nice work, John. Nice work.

1188
01:19:15,102 --> 01:19:16,395
Vic?

1189
01:19:17,146 --> 01:19:18,731
Hello. How is it going?

1190
01:19:19,023 --> 01:19:21,191
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1191
01:21:36,827 --> 01:21:40,873
"Neil used to say:
This life of ours is a wonderful life."

1192
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:45,210
"If we can get away with it."

1193
01:21:45,878 --> 01:21:49,839
The man some people consider to be
organized crime's boss of all bosses,

1194
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,092
John Gotti, was indicted today for
the 4th time in 5 years.

1195
01:21:53,093 --> 01:21:55,261
Gotti is charged with the 1985 murder

1196
01:21:55,262 --> 01:21:59,390
of the mob boss Paul Castellano.
The prosecutors hopes their best testimony,

1197
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:01,851
this time will come from
Gotti's own mouth.

1198
01:22:01,852 --> 01:22:04,771
You look at me like I don't know who I am.
I am the new boss.

1199
01:22:04,772 --> 01:22:08,067
I do whatever the fuck I want, without
stepping all the bounds.

1200
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:10,693
Now I'm telling you.
If something happens to me,

1201
01:22:10,694 --> 01:22:13,696
and I end up in a can,
I want Sammy to be the acting boss.

1202
01:22:13,697 --> 01:22:15,198
- Is that clear?
- Clear.

1203
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,449
These are my wishes.

1204
01:22:16,575 --> 01:22:19,494
I would be a billionaire
if I was looking to be poor.

1205
01:22:19,495 --> 01:22:21,496
All I want is this sandwich.

1206
01:22:21,497 --> 01:22:24,999
Every time I fucking turn around,
there is a new company.

1207
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,502
Every time we got a partner
or the boss to fuck with us.

1208
01:22:27,503 --> 01:22:29,213
We kill them...

1209
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,510
- He's a yellow dot.
- I took your word for, Sam.

1210
01:22:33,801 --> 01:22:35,636
I allowed it to be done.

1211
01:23:07,126 --> 01:23:09,377
Yeah he probably won't.
He is not gonna be here

1212
01:23:09,378 --> 01:23:11,964
for breakfast.
They took him away the last night.

1213
01:23:17,136 --> 01:23:18,553
Please give your name.

1214
01:23:18,554 --> 01:23:20,179
Salvatore Gravano.

1215
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,515
Do they call you Salvatore?

1216
01:23:22,933 --> 01:23:24,309
Sammy.

1217
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:27,000
Mr Gravano, could you please
speak in through the microphone.

1218
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,730
Sure.

1219
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:32,276
I didn't follow my own advice.

1220
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,778
Never trust anyone who

1221
01:23:35,779 --> 01:23:37,488
hasn't done time.

1222
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:39,866
That's where men are made.

1223
01:23:39,867 --> 01:23:42,869
Sammy the bull became Sammy the rat.

1224
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:46,331
The government cut him a deal after
admitting in his part in

1225
01:23:46,332 --> 01:23:48,542
19 murders and
testifying against me.

1226
01:23:50,294 --> 01:23:54,047
John Joseph Gotti,
you have been convicted on all counts of

1227
01:23:54,048 --> 01:23:57,175
criminal racketeering, murder, and
conspiracy.

1228
01:23:57,176 --> 01:24:01,346
You are hereby remanded to serve a
term of no less than 5 life sentences.

1229
01:24:01,722 --> 01:24:04,933
You will also be assessed
to 50 dollar court fee.

1230
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:06,851
Do you have anything to say?

1231
01:24:06,852 --> 01:24:08,353
Yeah, your honor.

1232
01:24:08,354 --> 01:24:10,605
The 5 life time bids, that's okay,

1233
01:24:10,606 --> 01:24:14,568
but the 50 dollars surcharge...
You are a tough guy.

1234
01:24:16,028 --> 01:24:19,197
Today... another milestone in the
fight against organized crime.

1235
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:21,115
The Teflon is gone

1236
01:24:21,116 --> 01:24:25,370
the don is covered with Velcro
and every charge in the indictment stuck.

1237
01:24:27,581 --> 01:24:29,100
Mayhem outside Brooklyn's
federal court house

1238
01:24:29,124 --> 01:24:31,626
as John Gotti gets life.

1239
01:24:31,627 --> 01:24:32,997
And his supporters cry foul.

1240
01:24:35,381 --> 01:24:38,217
Demanding a retrial
they rushed police line...

1241
01:24:38,467 --> 01:24:41,886
They pulled a lot of dirty tricks.
I don't believe there are witness.

1242
01:24:41,887 --> 01:24:44,722
Then tried to break into the
court to free the mafia boss.

1243
01:24:44,723 --> 01:24:47,684
He's a good guy.
He does a lot for the community, you know?

1244
01:24:47,685 --> 01:24:48,935
Put him away for nothing.

1245
01:24:49,311 --> 01:24:51,604
After today's arrest his supporters smashed

1246
01:24:51,605 --> 01:24:54,232
and overturned cars.
The verdict on John Gotti

1247
01:24:54,233 --> 01:24:56,068
is less likely to be overturned.

1248
01:24:56,735 --> 01:24:58,246
Law enforcement officials
fear that a violent

1249
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:59,756
power struggle may happen
within Gotti's family.

1250
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,782
May happen within Gotti's family.

1251
01:25:01,865 --> 01:25:05,618
And ironically, the only
one who may be able to keep the peace

1252
01:25:05,619 --> 01:25:06,869
is John Gotti.

1253
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:10,749
My loyal crewman, Eddie Lino

1254
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,542
was the first to go down.

1255
01:25:21,385 --> 01:25:24,805
Bobby Boriello, my closest
friend and my son's right arm

1256
01:25:24,847 --> 01:25:26,139
was next.

1257
01:25:29,101 --> 01:25:31,478
That's the life.
They understood that.

1258
01:25:43,073 --> 01:25:44,490
What's going on?

1259
01:25:44,491 --> 01:25:47,953
There is a contract out on me
and the rest of Sammy's crew.

1260
01:25:48,746 --> 01:25:51,873
- Who's behind it?
- Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti.

1261
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:55,794
Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti...

1262
01:25:58,714 --> 01:26:00,382
They are after you too Johnny.

1263
01:26:04,595 --> 01:26:08,056
"Like father, like son".

1264
01:26:09,767 --> 01:26:13,770
- Why are you pissed off?
- I had to read about it!

1265
01:26:13,771 --> 01:26:15,396
It's on the cover of the paper!

1266
01:26:15,397 --> 01:26:18,316
- What papers?
- Our son is a target!

1267
01:26:18,317 --> 01:26:22,612
- The Daily News? The fucking post?
- Yeah the Daily News and the Post.

1268
01:26:22,613 --> 01:26:24,489
I already buried a son.

1269
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:27,992
You want me to bury another
then you will bury me too.

1270
01:26:27,993 --> 01:26:31,412
You swore to me in our own bed,

1271
01:26:31,413 --> 01:26:34,332
you promised that you would not
bring him into that world.

1272
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:36,542
What world? What world
are you talking about?

1273
01:26:36,543 --> 01:26:38,544
Tell me the world you're talking about!

1274
01:26:38,545 --> 01:26:41,798
I brought him into this world,
you brought him into the life.

1275
01:26:42,257 --> 01:26:44,926
Ah come on, shut the fuck up!
You don't know what...

1276
01:26:45,677 --> 01:26:47,471
Where are you going? Get back here!

1277
01:26:48,013 --> 01:26:49,263
Fuck!

1278
01:27:26,885 --> 01:27:30,555
I am not gonna beat around the bush.
I am gonna ask you a question.

1279
01:27:30,597 --> 01:27:33,057
According to your answer, one
of us is gonna stand down.

1280
01:27:33,058 --> 01:27:36,811
The chief ordered this?
No. So don't play dumb with me.

1281
01:27:36,812 --> 01:27:38,873
This fucking nonsense about
Sammy's and his crew

1282
01:27:38,897 --> 01:27:40,732
you telling me it came from my father?

1283
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,985
Then I suggest you stand down my friend.

1284
01:27:43,986 --> 01:27:45,421
Oh, you're prepared to defend these guys?

1285
01:27:45,445 --> 01:27:48,865
No. I am prepared to defend my father.
Whatever he says goes. Period.

1286
01:28:05,424 --> 01:28:07,008
Okay.

1287
01:28:13,932 --> 01:28:18,561
Five organized crime families
are in a state of a

1288
01:28:18,562 --> 01:28:22,398
New people are moving up taking the place
of the older ones who are now in prison

1289
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:24,025
or who ever killed.

1290
01:28:29,156 --> 01:28:32,575
Locked up, or held under indictment,
virtually, every

1291
01:28:32,576 --> 01:28:37,205
boss of every family in New York city
and throughout the US.

1292
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,902
You can't be fucking kidding me...

1293
01:29:07,277 --> 01:29:08,567
What the hell is going on?

1294
01:29:08,695 --> 01:29:11,185
What the hell is going on?
What do you think is going on?

1295
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,532
Jesus...

1296
01:29:13,492 --> 01:29:15,076
Kids, come to daddy. Come here.

1297
01:29:16,286 --> 01:29:19,122
I will be gone for a little while.

1298
01:29:19,623 --> 01:29:20,999
Come here.

1299
01:30:05,294 --> 01:30:08,338
Don't worry about daddy.
I will be back in a little while.

1300
01:30:25,105 --> 01:30:26,814
We are today

1301
01:30:26,815 --> 01:30:30,360
4 federal indictments
charging a total of 40 defenses

1302
01:30:30,402 --> 01:30:33,738
with a wide spread pattern of
racketeering and other crimes

1303
01:30:33,905 --> 01:30:37,033
including multiple extortion,
murder conspiracy,

1304
01:30:37,034 --> 01:30:39,661
telecommunication fraud, illegal gambling,

1305
01:30:39,703 --> 01:30:41,371
money laundering...

1306
01:30:42,289 --> 01:30:46,500
Defendant's charge include, John A.
Gotti, also known as "Junior",

1307
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:49,086
who was alleged to have exercise

1308
01:30:49,087 --> 01:30:52,673
supervisor control over the Gambino family

1309
01:30:52,674 --> 01:30:55,468
since his father John J.
Gotti was convicted

1310
01:30:55,469 --> 01:30:59,096
of federal racketeering charges in 1992.

1311
01:30:59,097 --> 01:31:00,765
These are just bullshit charges.

1312
01:31:01,183 --> 01:31:02,683
John, there's no way

1313
01:31:02,684 --> 01:31:04,842
that they can tie you to
any of those specific crimes.

1314
01:31:04,866 --> 01:31:05,955
They don't have to.

1315
01:31:05,979 --> 01:31:07,905
It's the recoil conspiracy,
that's the problem.

1316
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:10,209
They just have to prove I'm
a member of the enterprise.

1317
01:31:10,233 --> 01:31:11,836
- We can beat them.
- And then what?

1318
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:15,154
They just throw more charges at
me, like they did with my father.

1319
01:31:15,155 --> 01:31:16,656
I've had enough.

1320
01:31:16,948 --> 01:31:20,159
I have been pulling back.
I am ready to move on with my life.

1321
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,170
Are you saying what I'm
think you're saying?

1322
01:31:27,626 --> 01:31:28,876
Alright.

1323
01:31:37,969 --> 01:31:41,931
John, if that's what you want to do, if
you're ready to walk away from this life,

1324
01:31:42,432 --> 01:31:43,493
I am happy for you.

1325
01:31:43,517 --> 01:31:48,437
Just understand there are potential
consequences to that decision.

1326
01:31:48,438 --> 01:31:51,357
And there gonna be people out there
who are gonna be very unhappy

1327
01:31:51,358 --> 01:31:52,502
with the decision you make.

1328
01:31:52,526 --> 01:31:56,321
That's why Charlie, you need to arrange
for me a meeting with my father.

1329
01:31:56,863 --> 01:31:59,491
And he's is to come for me directly.
He is dying.

1330
01:31:59,825 --> 01:32:01,534
He was my cause.

1331
01:32:02,786 --> 01:32:05,789
Now it's time to move on.
I want closure.

1332
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:11,141
John, I got no cancer in my brain
and I got no cancer in my heart.

1333
01:32:11,378 --> 01:32:15,423
But what I wouldn't do, to have one
more time to go into that court room

1334
01:32:15,424 --> 01:32:18,218
and show them what a man
is, break their holes.

1335
01:32:18,343 --> 01:32:20,428
You show them what a man in.

1336
01:32:20,429 --> 01:32:22,597
You show them what it takes to have this.

1337
01:32:28,562 --> 01:32:31,272
Now, we only got 5 minutes left.

1338
01:32:32,274 --> 01:32:35,777
I don't know when or if
I will ever see you again.

1339
01:32:36,194 --> 01:32:39,822
And I don't know if I got through
to you or not, but I know,

1340
01:32:39,823 --> 01:32:41,908
you got a lot of thinking to do.

1341
01:32:43,201 --> 01:32:44,577
I know.

1342
01:32:47,456 --> 01:32:49,623
I miss seeing you, John.

1343
01:32:49,624 --> 01:32:51,918
You have no idea how
much I miss seeing you.

1344
01:32:52,419 --> 01:32:53,479
You know,

1345
01:32:53,503 --> 01:32:55,338
this meeting, today,

1346
01:32:55,714 --> 01:32:58,842
was worth 55 years
hanging upside down.

1347
01:32:59,342 --> 01:33:01,760
Because now you know how I feel.

1348
01:33:01,761 --> 01:33:04,305
I love you and I adore you...

1349
01:33:04,764 --> 01:33:06,182
I know.

1350
01:33:07,058 --> 01:33:08,518
So...

1351
01:33:12,522 --> 01:33:15,525
You do what you have to do.

1352
01:33:15,567 --> 01:33:17,234
And don't worry about me.

1353
01:33:17,235 --> 01:33:19,279
It doesn't make sense.

1354
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,865
What will be will be.

1355
01:33:22,699 --> 01:33:25,869
You stand up strong, put your head up.

1356
01:33:27,579 --> 01:33:28,997
Don't Cry.

1357
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:31,040
Don't let this have this satisfaction.

1358
01:33:32,292 --> 01:33:33,585
Come on.

1359
01:34:02,405 --> 01:34:05,366
PLEA AGREEMENT

1360
01:34:17,003 --> 01:34:18,105
Scissors.

1361
01:34:18,129 --> 01:34:19,422
Here sir.

1362
01:34:20,382 --> 01:34:24,344
What are you looking at me for?
You are gonna be here when I'm 82.

1363
01:34:34,062 --> 01:34:36,147
- You are beautiful.
- Thanks Gotti.

1364
01:34:36,314 --> 01:34:38,775
You ever met my wife much?

1365
01:34:40,735 --> 01:34:42,528
Why you fighting so hard?

1366
01:34:42,529 --> 01:34:45,448
If you keep this, they are just
gonna send you back to solitary.

1367
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,950
Every day I am alive

1368
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:50,619
is to fuck your government.

1369
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:51,913
You understand?

1370
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:57,669
My son Peter was at my bed
side till the very end.

1371
01:34:57,961 --> 01:35:00,171
I didn't want Vicky or
girls to see me like that.

1372
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:03,966
I made Vicky promise
and she respected my wishes.

1373
01:35:03,967 --> 01:35:05,593
He is in a lot of pain.

1374
01:35:07,178 --> 01:35:09,138
I know that Morphine's no longer working.

1375
01:35:09,139 --> 01:35:11,307
Now, we can give him Ativan.

1376
01:35:11,308 --> 01:35:13,392
It will induce a coma.

1377
01:35:13,393 --> 01:35:16,145
He will be alive, but
he won't feel the pain.

1378
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:23,903
Think about this, Peter.

1379
01:35:24,237 --> 01:35:25,697
It's your call.

1380
01:35:32,579 --> 01:35:34,539
You keep your head up...

1381
01:35:35,206 --> 01:35:36,916
and be strong.

1382
01:35:38,543 --> 01:35:39,836
Okay?

1383
01:35:40,462 --> 01:35:42,129
Promise me.

1384
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:43,423
I promise.

1385
01:35:44,424 --> 01:35:45,758
Alright.

1386
01:35:49,846 --> 01:35:52,348
Hey yo J! Check it out!

1387
01:36:02,484 --> 01:36:05,944
One of the high profile
mobsters of recent times,

1388
01:36:05,945 --> 01:36:09,448
John Gotti, died today
in a prison hospital in Missouri,

1389
01:36:09,449 --> 01:36:11,533
after a battle with throat cancer.

1390
01:36:11,534 --> 01:36:13,952
Gotti was known as "The
Teflon Don"

1391
01:36:13,953 --> 01:36:17,039
or "the deper don,
nickname due to his taste"

1392
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,584
for wearing fancy double breasted suits.

1393
01:36:20,585 --> 01:36:22,878
Gotti was acquitted
a number of times

1394
01:36:22,879 --> 01:36:26,548
prior to being sentenced to
5 consecutive life terms

1395
01:36:26,549 --> 01:36:27,966
in 1992.

1396
01:36:27,967 --> 01:36:29,969
John Gotti dead today

1397
01:36:30,095 --> 01:36:31,721
at age 61.

1398
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:03,043
Everybody here knows
that he was a great man.

1399
01:37:03,044 --> 01:37:06,023
Look he might have been in jail, but you
know something, nobody is the saint.

1400
01:37:06,047 --> 01:37:08,549
He didn't go around killing civilians,

1401
01:37:08,758 --> 01:37:11,177
normal people of the street
or anything like that.

1402
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:12,928
He killed his own kind.

1403
01:37:12,929 --> 01:37:14,931
"John Gotti forever"

1404
01:37:22,731 --> 01:37:25,524
When he went to prison,
the crime rate

1405
01:37:25,525 --> 01:37:27,503
started going up.
The street wants to taken over.

1406
01:37:27,527 --> 01:37:30,989
It was a lot cleaner neighborhood
when Mr Gotti was around.

1407
01:37:47,797 --> 01:37:51,551
"John Gotti will live forever"

1408
01:38:03,313 --> 01:38:06,482
How could you be so naive?
Once they get you in,

1409
01:38:06,483 --> 01:38:07,941
you will never be free again.

1410
01:38:07,942 --> 01:38:11,404
They say you win this time but next time
they will make sure that you're gone.

1411
01:38:23,124 --> 01:38:24,792
This is bullshit!

1412
01:38:24,793 --> 01:38:27,005
A hundred more fucking years?
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1413
01:38:27,029 --> 01:38:27,730
John! Calm Down!

1414
01:38:27,754 --> 01:38:30,173
No! My father told me they
would never let me go!

1415
01:38:30,215 --> 01:38:33,926
He told me that. They wanna
fight the legacy of John Gotti?

1416
01:38:34,093 --> 01:38:36,554
Well, let them fight John Gotti!

1417
01:38:40,433 --> 01:38:41,683
We would like to believe

1418
01:38:41,726 --> 01:38:45,855
that a trial in its purest form
is a search for the truth.

1419
01:38:46,064 --> 01:38:49,858
But search for the truth requires
willingness to see the truth.

1420
01:38:49,859 --> 01:38:54,112
Yesterday, the prosecutor
spoke to you about what he perceived to be,

1421
01:38:54,113 --> 01:38:55,907
the courage of his witnesses.

1422
01:38:56,074 --> 01:38:59,201
Well the truth is,
speaking up behind someone

1423
01:38:59,202 --> 01:39:02,580
and shooting them in the
head is not an act of courage.

1424
01:39:02,747 --> 01:39:06,500
It's an act of deception,
it's a display of treachery,

1425
01:39:06,501 --> 01:39:10,170
and it's a demonstration of
a cold blooded willingness

1426
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:11,923
to put their own interests

1427
01:39:12,006 --> 01:39:13,799
above that of anyone else,

1428
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,884
regardless of the consequences.

1429
01:39:15,885 --> 01:39:19,096
Contrast that with the
courage required of John,

1430
01:39:19,097 --> 01:39:21,724
who admittedly was in that life,

1431
01:39:22,433 --> 01:39:25,645
but who paid for his
crimes with many years in prison.

1432
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:28,981
But John had the courage
to walk away from that life.

1433
01:39:29,065 --> 01:39:32,610
The courage to tell
his dying father,

1434
01:39:32,652 --> 01:39:34,570
to whom the life was everything,

1435
01:39:34,696 --> 01:39:37,364
that his obligations were to his family,

1436
01:39:37,365 --> 01:39:39,033
not to a crime family.

1437
01:39:39,117 --> 01:39:42,036
But reality is John left the life
on his terms.

1438
01:39:42,328 --> 01:39:45,373
Cooperation in return
for a reduced sentence?

1439
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:47,434
No thanks.

1440
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:51,379
He said, "I will do my own
time for my own crimes."

1441
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:54,047
In 11 years,

1442
01:39:54,048 --> 01:39:57,092
since then the government has spent
millions of taxpayer dollars

1443
01:39:57,093 --> 01:39:59,303
in five prosecutions.

1444
01:39:59,304 --> 01:40:03,682
They shift John all across the country
under the most horrible conditions

1445
01:40:03,683 --> 01:40:07,561
and what they jokingly refer
to is "diesel therapy".

1446
01:40:07,562 --> 01:40:11,690
But in the end, they could not provide

1447
01:40:11,691 --> 01:40:16,320
even a single credible allegation
of any contact

1448
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:19,282
between John and the enterprise.

1449
01:40:20,825 --> 01:40:24,704
Once again, the government just
refuses to see the truth.

1450
01:40:25,288 --> 01:40:27,873
When the government goes off the rails

1451
01:40:27,874 --> 01:40:30,667
driven by ego and obsession,

1452
01:40:30,668 --> 01:40:35,797
it's incumbent upon its citizens to
guide the government back on course.

1453
01:40:35,798 --> 01:40:38,425
In this system, in this courtroom,

1454
01:40:38,426 --> 01:40:42,138
you, the jury, are the
conscience of the government.

1455
01:40:42,805 --> 01:40:45,391
It's time to do the right thing.

1456
01:40:46,309 --> 01:40:48,019
Send him home.

1457
01:40:48,394 --> 01:40:50,313
Send him home to his wife and his kids.

1458
01:40:52,398 --> 01:40:55,943
Send him home to live the
life he chose to live.

1459
01:40:56,736 --> 01:40:58,029
He's earned it.

1460
01:41:07,246 --> 01:41:09,665
The government tried hard
to break Johnny boy,

1461
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:11,583
but my son took him to task.

1462
01:41:11,584 --> 01:41:13,919
5 trials in 37 months,

1463
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,297
and the government
walked away with nothing.

1464
01:41:40,363 --> 01:41:43,198
Listen to me. And listen to me.

1465
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,701
You are never gonna see
another guy like me

1466
01:41:45,702 --> 01:41:48,079
if you live to be 5 thousand.
