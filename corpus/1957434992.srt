00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:03,938
(dramatic ambient music)

2
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:14,228
(ominous electronic music)

3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,450
- The disease begins at
the navel, and it trickles

4
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,860
its little way into the immune system.

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,630
It starts with dark
circles around the eyes,

6
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,200
stiff straw-like hair.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,200
By stage two of the disease, confusion.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,273
Paranoia set in.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,510
By stage three, deliria.

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,780
Baby Lewis, son of
Molly and Randolph Lewis

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,600
is the first victim of the Apollo Plague.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,533
Baby Lewis, we're all
pullin' for ya buddy.

13
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,671

(playful orchestral music)

32
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,179
- Softballs, pancakes, chocolate cake.

33
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:16,171
- [Grandma] Shut up!

34
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:17,445
- Get outta bed, aunt 'kay?

35
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:18,863
- [Grandma] Where's Bob?

36
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:21,150
I've had him for 60 years,

37
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,653
what did you do with him!
- He's not here.

38
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:23,930
- [Grandma] Open this door.

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,133
Arrogant little brat!
- He's not in here.

40
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,140
- Every day it gets crazier in here.

41
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,604
Where is he?

42
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:32,833
- He's mine, grandma.

43
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,793
- He's mine!
- He's mine!

44
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:37,206
(gasps) You put holes in him.

45
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:38,368
What've you done?

46
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,118
You put holes in him.

47
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:44,653
Oh you outrageous brat!

48
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:49,131
- No!
- Whoa, yes, yes, yes.

49
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:49,964
And this?

50
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:51,148
- Grandma no, I promise.

51
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:53,126
Remember, I did the dishes?

52
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:55,970
- Yes, you did 'em terribly,
had to do them over again.

53
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,070
There's more to dishes
than soap and water.

54
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,927
- I'll do them better
from now on, I promise.

55
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:01,740
McGillicutty Bob is mine, he's mine!

56
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,657
- He's mine, he's mine.

57
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,308
Oh, see this, see this?

58
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,343
- Grandma, no!
- See it?

59
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:09,557
- No!

60
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,360
- You always got the door locked.

61
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
What're you doing in here?

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,023
Scheming?

63
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,233
Dancing?

64
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,095
Sick child, open your mouth.

65
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:22,020
(Grandma yells)

66
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,936
Colorful tongue, rotten teeth.

67
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,840
(Grandma yells)

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,153
Your whole life is abhorrent.

69
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:33,413
You can keep this one.

70
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:36,136
It reminds me of your personality.

71
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,110
60 years.

72
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,130
- I think you'll be able
to easily fix him, grandma.

73
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,190
I mean I didn't think--

74
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,550
- He'll never be fixed.

75
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,790
Never, never, never,
never, never, never, never.

76
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:49,892
Never, never!

77
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,652
(sobs) Never.

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,027
(ominous music)

79
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:11,841
- Aimy, I think you've
taken it too far this time.

80
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,140
Why don't you go apologize to her, huh?

81
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,740
- She'll cool off sooner or later,

82
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,620
she always does.

83
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,070
- Aimy, I need you to stop
being so crazy for one minute.

84
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,323
- I'm not crazy.

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,533
- Okay.

86
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,400
For some reason, this is how you've chosen

87
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,287
to interact with people,
but really do you think

88
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,413
you could be that way when you're 35, 45?

89
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,530
Really?

90
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,933
You think you can get a job
like that in the real world?

91
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,770
I think if you go and sincerely...

92
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,040
But I think if you go
and sincerely apologize

93
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,520
to her right now.

94
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,260
Are you even listening to me?

95
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,430
Here, let me give you some life advice.

96
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,368
Respect your elders.

97
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:52,972
(alligator roars)

98
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:54,253
Oh, God.

99
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,420
What did I do?

100
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:57,228
You know what?

101
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,540
I've got more important
things to do than meeting

102
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,490
at a tiff between you
and your grandmother.

103
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,520
I've got a doctorate thesis.

104
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,170
An undergraduate advisory.

105
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,530
Right now you can't even
trust your own brain.

106
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,572
No, no.

107
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,660
Aimy, Aimy this is not funny.

108
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,741
Aimy this is not a joke.
- It's very funny.

109
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,226
- Stay away, animal.

110
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,732
- [Aimy] Come back you ass!

111
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,149
(Aimy yells)

112
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,790
- What business do you have touching

113
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,660
your grandmother's possessions?

114
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,090
What entitles you, child?

115
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,971
- I had to let him out.

116
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,450
For some air!

117
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,240
- What entitles you to decide
when it's let out for air?

118
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,890
And stop poking your food and eat.

119
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,380
- How much longer do you
think we'll put up with this?

120
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,360
It gets worse everyday.

121
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,682
- There isn't a meaning behind it, mother.

122
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:42,970
- That's right.

123
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,580
- Nor a purpose.

124
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,054
- I think that sometimes that she just

125
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,920
acts without thinking.

126
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,840
Ow, ow.

127
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,515
- Why can't you all just
accept me for who I am?

128
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,603
- Get your hands outta the candy jar!

129
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
- [Father] Sit down!

130
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,430
- Just continue on, continue on.

131
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,663
Just ignore her.

132
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,073
(knocking)

133
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:10,656
(Aimy giggles)

134
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,159
- Now Aimy.

135
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:20,485
I don't exactly know what's
happened here with this doll,

136
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,920
but I can see by the way
it's been torn in half,

137
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,135
and by the way--

138
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:26,968
- Mr. Bohringer, she tore my paintings

139
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:28,370
into a million pieces.

140
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,823
- Do not talk, Aimy.

141
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,920
And I want you to sit down in that chair.

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,680
We're gonna get something figured out,

143
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,310
so everybody's happy and you can grow up

144
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,310
to be the nice, sweet,
lovely girl that you are.

145
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:43,428
- 60 years.

146
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,599
I had him for 60 years.

147
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,501
- Actually, you've committed a felony.

148
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,010
If this were my court,
I could imprison you.

149
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,090
- I would've stealed after the first day.

150
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,325
I'll steal all the loot.

151
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:02,521
(Aimy laughs)

152
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:05,608
- Her voice, I can't take it anymore!

153
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:06,890
Get down this instance!

154
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,416
I know what you're doing
all day, locked up in there.

155
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,011
- [Father] Order in the court!

156
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:12,867
- I'll fly away.

157
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,551
- Stop spinning!

158
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:16,439
Stop spinning this instant.

159
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,743
- No!
- It's outrageous.

160
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:19,484
- Off with yourself!

161
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:20,703
- Off with his head!

162
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:23,266
- Oh no.

163
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,985
Aimy, you need to stop spinning.

164
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,721
- I must spin.

165
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:30,138

00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:24,760
- Good morning!

182
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,593
- Where's Grandma?

183
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:27,920
- I am Commander Douglass
Harrington Lopchocks.

184
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,000
I heard about you all morning
long over tea and biscuits.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,210
- Am I under arrest?

186
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,640
- Your grandmother makes
the most delicious biscuits.

187
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,380
- She is a biscuit.

188
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,080
- She's trying to get on
your good side, commander.

189
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,340
Don't listen to a word.

190
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,930
And it's all because of these paintings.

191
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,560
I should just burn them all.

192
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,061
- Shoot her, shoot her!

193
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,980
(thunder rumbling)

194
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,710
- Where are the secret paintings?

195
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,280
- If you knew about it,
it wouldn't be a secret.

196
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,268
- I believe she's hidden some paintings

197
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:59,360
underneath her mattress.

198
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,640
- Oh!

199
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,473
Get up Aimy.

200
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:02,840
Get up right now!

201
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,460
Or we send you to jail,
isn't that right commander?

202
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,823
- Only a phone call away.

203
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,120
In my early years, I
used to overlook a ward

204
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,420
of a the criminally insane.

205
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,920
These pictures?

206
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,852
They would fit right in.

207
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,204
- [Grandma] Why do you think that is?

208
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,520
- Look at the lines...
- Yes.

209
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,370
- The abstractions.

210
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,110
In my view, these
pictures relate to someone

211
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,230
who is completely unstable.

212
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,210
An unsound mind of startling proportions.

213
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,277
The doctors are busy
at this time, but yes.

214
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:37,253
- Oh wait!
(clock rings)

215
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,540
- Why are you sitting there like that?

216
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,373
Speak child, say words.

217
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,477
- [Grandma] She doesn't want surgery.

218
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,995
- I'm sure she'd rather rein goats!

219
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:53,060
But we can't always get what we want.

220
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,070
- Hey grandma, grandma I'm
really sorry about yesterday.

221
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,250
Daddy, it'll kill me.

222
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,648
- Of course it's going to kill you.

223
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:05,034
It's gonna kill the old Aimy.

224
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:07,540
The one who destroys my mother's things,

225
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,450
and only apologizes when
she wants something.

226
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,370
- I've been thinking a
lot about how much I need

227
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,680
to work on myself, and
grandma if you delay

228
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,120
the operation I'll make it up to you

229
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,600
for the rest of my life!

230
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,000
- She's been vying for sympathy all day.

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,293
This is not how the world works, Aimy.

232
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:26,473
- But I'm the world too.

233
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,000
- Maybe.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,830
We're being a little bit
too hard on her right now.

235
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,541
Maybe she needs to rest, and
think, and contemplate some--

236
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,275
- I want to paint!

237
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:39,670
- [Grandma] Who would
ever pay you to paint?

238
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,110
- [Bohringer] Painting fences.

239
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,946
That's the way to get paid for painting.

240
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:44,090
- Hey Grandma.

241
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,371
- This must be a real
nightmare for you, Aimy.

242
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,038
- It is a nightmare.

243
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,273
No one's on my side.

244
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:55,660
- I'm on your side Aimy.

245
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,360
- Grandma wants me to get surgery.

246
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,650
- I'll make sure, with all of my power,

247
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,150
that I will not let you
get any kind of surgery.

248
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,830
You don't need it, it's not necessary.

249
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,707
- Tell them that.

250
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:10,340
Tell them that, Mr. Bohringer.

251
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,270
Tell 'em I don't need surgery.

252
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,530
- I promise.

253
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,200
I'll do everything I can to make sure

254
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,580
you don't get that surgery.

255
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,053
Don't worry about it.

256
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,543
You'll be okay.

257
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,250
- I've been staying up past
my bedtime, and talking back.

258
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,184
I've been watching too much TV and stuff,

259
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:31,944
and seeing things and
shows that I know I'm not

260
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:33,100
allowed to because it
would make grandma mad.

261
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,130
- [Nurse] She loved grandma.

262
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,640
- [Aimy] Yes, I love her so much.

263
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,450
- [Nurse] You say you
hate her all the time.

264
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,750
We've found your notebook.

265
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,040
- No, no, no.

266
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,940
I'm so grateful for
everything she does for me.

267
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,990
I know that not a lot of
grandmas would put up with me.

268
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,640
I know that if I was with any other family

269
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,250
they would've put me out on
the street a long time ago!

270
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,220
- [Nurse] It's really good
that you recognize this.

271
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,726
It's going to be very
helpful after the surgery.

272
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:52,559
- Wait everyone, please!

273
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,392
Cancel the surgery!

274
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,980
Pack up your things and go
home before morning traffic.

275
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,300
It's not even breakfast
yet, so it's not too late.

276
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,997
I'm sure the insurance
companies will still pay you

277
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:01,520
for all the trouble you've gone through.

278
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,301
- [Nurse] Grandma says
you have no friends.

279
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:04,350
- I know that I don't have any friends,

280
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,917
but that's because I can't control myself.

281
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,023
But that doesn't mean I have to be

282
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:09,530
that way to my own family.

283
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,320
Dr. Issie, I realize that.

284
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,470
- [Dr. Issie] Give yourself
more credit than that.

285
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,900
- I'm being honest.

286
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,282
That's why I'll take pills!

287
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:17,008
I'll take 50 pills if you tell me.

288
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:18,488
But since I'm being so honest with you,

289
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,563
I don't even need surgery!

290
00:12:19,563 --> 00:12:22,920
If I was crazy, then I
wouldn't know that I was crazy.

291
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,240
- [Dr. Issie] Nobody said you're crazy,

292
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,567
don't torture yourself.

293
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,579
- What's that noise?

294
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,386
Dr. Issie, I'm scared.

295
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:31,520
Why can't we do it tomorrow?

296
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,970
Can't we just do it tomorrow?

297
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,364
Where's Steve?

298
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:39,367
- [Dr. Issie] Prepare 50 milligrams--

299
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,431
- Mr. Bohringer said
that I didn't have to.

300
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:42,264
- Liar!

301
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,598
- Grandma, I'm gonna get you for this!

302
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,118
If you thought I was
bad before, just wait!

303
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,285
I'm gonna ruin everything!

(light piano music)

329
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,770
- If you see someone with skin peeling,

330
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,930
they might not have
just gone to the beach.

331
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,460
They might have the Apollo Plague.

332
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,293
What do you do?

333
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,510
You want the Apollo strain in your school?

334
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,560
- Baby Lewis' first words
were neither mommy, nor daddy.

335
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,020
In fact, he never uttered a word at all.

336
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,210
- Amy, look up!

337
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,760
- You want it in the meat that you eat?

338
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,800
That you pack in the
lunches for your child?

339
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,733
This is the kind of plague
that creeps in silently,

340
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,743
while you sleep,

341
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,783
while you dream.

342
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,030
- I have ordered the most
delightful chardonnay.

343
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,443
I was hoping it would get here
before my face creams, alas--

344
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:49,593
- Oh boy!
- Oh, Steve.

345
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,306
You are so wonderful.

346
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:57,013
It's great to have a mathematician around.

347
00:14:57,013 --> 00:15:00,147
Would you like me to show you how to knit?

348
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:01,360
- Everybody lift your bed up!

349
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,060
- You would probably be wonderful.

350
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:06,835
Tomorrow let's have a knitting lesson.

351
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,034
(plate shatters)

352
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,024
(frantic instrumental music)

353
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:11,927
Steve?

354
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:14,118
Can you hear me with those things on?

355
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:15,561
- On the ceiling!

356
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,502
- What a sweet boy you are.

357
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:18,669
- Their noses!

358
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,753
(Aimy yells)

359
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,600
- Only yours is real.
- Watch out for the pelicans.

360
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,603
- I bet you'll be very good at this,

361
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:33,584
you'll be very lovely, Steve.

362
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,334
- Heel storm violent!

363
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:41,236
(Aimy screaming)

364
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:46,920
- Are you all right, sweetie?

365
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,484
- [Aimy] Grandma!

366
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:55,494
Where are you?

367
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,392
(soft bell music)

368
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,127
- My students, they've been
coming up to me and saying,

369
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:09,010
"Mr. Debinshire, are we all in danger?"

370
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,770
So heartbreaking.

371
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,280
That they're instilling all this fear

372
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,820
into these children.
- I agree, exactly.

373
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,560
- I mean just look at the
statistics that these researchers

374
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,970
who dedicate their entire lives--

375
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,546
- Stupid scientists.

376
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,379
- You can just tell it's going nowhere,

377
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,617
this Apollo virus.

378
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:24,044
- That's right.
- Exactly.

379
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,260
- The amount of TV exposure it has.

380
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,330
You think it was already here.

381
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,806
- Oh, look who's coming.

382
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,472
- It's Aimy.
- Hello.

383
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:33,570
- Aimy, Aimy!

384
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,603
You know what century we're in, darling?

385
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:39,684
- Come here next to me.

386
00:16:39,684 --> 00:16:41,940
- [Grandma] You were so
funny at the surgery.

387
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,720
You had us all laughing.

388
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,415
Wasn't she hysterical?

389
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,515
- She was a hoot.
- Oh, it was priceless.

390
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,867
- Hands off the head.
- Being so melodramatic.

391
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,730
- Really means a lot
how supportive you are.

392
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,490
- Well that was positive.
- A supportive family!

393
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,590
- [Aimy] I'm absolutely normal now.

394
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,490
- [Father] I'd say the surgery
was a complete success.

395
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,797
- I feel it's time for a bath, huh?

396
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,557
Aimy, now open.

397
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:09,243
- Aimy, I see you're a
very wise investment.

398
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:11,146
- Open your mouth.

399
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:13,146
- You're so intelligent.

400
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,010
- I don't even have a desire to put

401
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,633
holes in grandma's dolls.

402
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,520
Hands off the head!

403
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,400
- [Grandma] You put a hole
in my dolls and now I put

404
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,196
a hole in yours!

405
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:30,928
- Yes, she has a juvenile
streak we're trying to milk out.

406
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:34,300
- It's time for you to grow
up, that's why I'm here.

407
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:36,196
- Look at that appetite.

408
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:38,463
That's the appetite of a sane person.

409
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:40,511
- This Apollo virsus?

410
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,250
Where do they come up
with these names anyway?

411
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,360
- Oh, it's like hurricanes, you know.

412
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,603
- Because it has extra cheese.

413
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:47,936
- [Mother] Aimy!

414
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,802
- Yeah, dairy has a lot of calcium.

415
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:53,463
- [Grandma] There she goes, goo.

416
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:57,030
- Aimy, how about...
- I think she said good.

417
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,041
She was expressing her delight.

418
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,458
(dinner guests chatting)

419
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:07,000
- Elena, I put peas in there.

420
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,717
Have some nutrients.

421
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,679
(Aimy yells)

422
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,762
- [Grandma] Good evening!

423
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:18,579
- [Father] Well my dear,
were those hunger pangs?

424
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,053
(Aimy yells)

425
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:22,143
- Hands off the head!

426
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,966
- [Grandma] What I worry about
is when she's 30-years-old

427
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:27,432
and she's still playing with her crayons

428
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:28,384
and seeing her friends.

429
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:29,341
- [Mother] I will make sure

430
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,310
that she's well married and pregnant.

431
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,422
Well hopefully by the time--

432
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:35,839
(Aimy yells)

433
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:38,940
(Steve laughs)

434
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,571
- Cheers to modern medicine.

435
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:41,936
- Cheers, cheers.

436
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:44,360
- That surgery was a complete success.

00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:23,806
- I'm going to make this
noise until we watch TV!

452
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:26,056
(groaning)

453
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:34,910
- Aimy, I told you to stay.
- I am staying.

454
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,578
- No, I saw you moving forward.

455
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:37,578
- I'm still sitting.

456
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,563
- Don't--

457
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:42,420
Hey, stop scooting forward.

458
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,483
Scoot southward.

459
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,173
- You're a doll in a dress.

460
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:47,246
- You're a doll in a dress.

461
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:48,079
- You're a doll in a dress.

462
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:48,913
- You're a doll in a dress.

463
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:51,771
- You're a doll in a dress!

464
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:53,873
- I'm taking away your doll.

465
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,383
Are you enjoying this conversation?

466
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,890
No, you are scooting more forward.

467
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,723
Scoot south, scoot south!

468
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:00,791
- I want to watch TV.

469
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,624
- No watching TV.

470
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:04,210
Everything on TV nowadays is talking about

471
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,478
that stupid Apollo Plague.

472
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:08,561
(bright organ music)

473
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:15,950
- My whole house is full of
the most gorgeous antiques.

474
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,247
This is from the sands of Aruba.

475
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:22,639
And this is from the deserts of Somalia.

476
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,389
- Sit down, sit down!

477
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:27,370
- This is my granddaughter.

478
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,620
Come on in Aimy.

479
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,000
- Hey, do not touch me
with your grimy hands.

480
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,270
- Hi, I'm Aimy Micry.

481
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,311
- Nice to meet you.

482
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:36,426
- She's going to be just a little doll.

483
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:39,238
(Aimy yells)

484
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,821
(light instrumental music)

485
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:49,440
- The Apollo strain is so
powerful, we don't know

486
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,940
what's in our food.

487
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,260
We don't know what we're eating.

488
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,440
- Then, you don't believe, she
has been coming onto Claude,

489
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,273
dancing with him.

490
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,150
Thinks I don't notice.

491
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,780
She thinks I don't notice?

492
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,050
I know what the little
tart has in her mind.

493
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,190
- We have to learn to be
aware, first and foremost.

494
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,253
We have to be aware of our surroundings.

495
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:13,615
(soft orchestral music)

496
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,040
- Do you have any friends?

497
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,253
- They stab me in the back.

498
00:21:24,253 --> 00:21:26,490
- What do you care about your back?

499
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,663
You sleep on the floor.

500
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,480
- Did you go through Wolwëurth?

501
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,313
- No.

502
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,320
Do you believe in any
of this Apollo stuff?

503
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,734
- I don't believe it for a second.

504
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:39,340
- Me neither.

505
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,360
- [Newscaster] Baby Lewis,
the first infant stricken

506
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,633
with the Apollo virus, is now showing new

507
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:44,504
brain wave activity--
- Baby Lewis!

508
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:45,805
No more baby Lewis!

509
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,430
- [Newscaster] Shown on baby Lewis' brain.

510
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,934
Full report after the
program, we now return.

511
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,517
(wacky instrumental music)

512
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,380
- Why don't you let me pick you up

513
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,170
a cheesecake for tomorrow?

514
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,260
- It's absolutely unnecessary, Jackie.

515
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,833
I'm baking, you know.

516
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,610
- I just think it'd maybe
be presumptuous of me

517
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,850
to not at least bring a cod.

518
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,320
- Look at her.

519
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,103
Get that spoon off your face!

520
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,670
- I worry, you know,
that Claude doesn't have

521
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,820
what it takes to make you happy.

522
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,583
He's years your junior.

523
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,233
- He has the biggest heart
of any man I've ever met.

524
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,515
You're gonna be a diabetic.

525
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,120
- Diabetic!

526
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,910
- We love you, honey.

527
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,550
- The main course for
tomorrow, I know just the one

528
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,667
to make the most delicious--

529
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:37,787
- I'm a sugar monster!

530
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:39,630
- Get off the table this moment!

531
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,530
We have company!

532
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,777
- No, you get up here!

533
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,870
You want everyone to think I'm crazy,

534
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,160
but you're just exaggerating
everything I ever did.

535
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,860
- You're trying to prove to
everybody that you're normal?

536
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,660
You could be a diplomat,
you could be a judge

537
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,790
on the Supreme Court.

538
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,090
- I want to be a snake charmer.

539
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,537
(light sitar music)

540
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:02,143
- Go to your room.

541
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:08,050
(Aimy yells)

542
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,408
Oh Jackie, I'm so embarrassed.

543
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:12,510
Will you accept my dearest apologies?

544
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:17,680
- [Jackie] Please don't be
embarrassed, absolutely I accept.

545
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,240
- Oh, you're just the best friend a girl

546
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,643
could ever have, and I appreciate that.

547
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,989
Get up, bitch!

548
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:27,406
(light orchestral music)

549
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:40,562
- Aimy.

550
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:42,669
I told you.

551
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,507
I told that you're gonna
battle for your mouth.

552
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:52,048
You just listen.

553
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:56,052
I told you that you had to be careful

554
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:58,469
and you did not listen to me.

555
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:03,654
Your grandmother is
reaching into your head,

556
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:09,350
and she's taking out every
bit of your brain cell

557
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,865
and she's putting it
her own head to get in

558
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:14,915
and it hurts you.

559
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:18,865
And I don't want that to happen to you.

560
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:20,198
I don't want it.

561
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:26,112
If you tell me your secrets,
you tell me what you need.

562
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:31,280
You tell me what you want.

563
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:35,130
- [Grandma] Claude, may I speak with Aimy?

564
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,943
- I think you've got to do something.

565
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,790
Aimy, she's been saying
things that aren't true.

566
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,800
If she's gonna keep doing
that, I'm gonna go be

567
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,050
in the bathtub and we're
gonna sign that paper

568
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,710
that we were talking about.

569
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,170
You talk to Aimy, you get it straight

570
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,270
in her mind right now.

571
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:04,236
- Aimy?

572
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,779
Hello?

573
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:08,665
Hello!

574
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:11,435
(Aimy screams)

575
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:12,827
- Help me!

576
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:13,660
- Shut up!

577
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,111

00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:17,021

(laughing)

588
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:51,560
- Sculpt it in a circle, Aimy.

589
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,800
- But it'll mess up the family.

590
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,173
- I said a circle, do you hear me?

591
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:58,000
I said you've been
vacuuming the same place

592
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,173
for half an hour!

593
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,593
Chin up!

594
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,950
Arch your back!

595
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,570
Eye contact!

596
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,590
Introduce yourself!

597
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,730
- I'm Aimy.

598
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,563
- Chin up!

599
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:11,160
You're gonna be the death of me.

600
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,893
Oh, McGillicutty Bob.

601
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:13,960
Arch your back!

602
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,530
Eye contact!

603
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,120
Introduce yourself!

604
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,230
- I'm Aimy.

605
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,280
I still see dirt.

606
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,120
- There is no dirt there.

607
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,670
No dirt, no dirt whatsoever.

608
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,363
The dirt is in your brain.

609
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,380
Introduce yourself!

610
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,213
- I'm Aimy.

611
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,720
- Are you gonna sit there and do the same

612
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,950
spot over, and over, and over?

613
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,783
- Grandma!

614
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,148
- I have been vacuuming for 60 years!

615
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:45,900
Stop it, stop it!

616
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,673
I want you to do the whole room!

617
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,923
- Ugh, she's been on the phone for hours.

618
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:52,102
Aimy.

619
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:54,020
- Oh Aimy, that won't do.

620
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,478
Turn around, try another.

621
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:58,060
- Oh Aimy, you look so pretty.

622
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,893
She looks so pretty.

623
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:00,650
- No honey, that won't do, but thank you

624
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,950
for putting in the effort.

625
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,683
- Oh my God.

626
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:06,421
- Absolutely not.

627
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,763
Let me get that stupid
helmet off your head.

628
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,790
- Eleanor, let me help you.

629
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,730
- No.

630
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,563
- Eleanor.

631
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:15,396
- Yes?

632
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,250
- I'll help you, I'll help you.

633
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,489
Lay on the bed, darling.
- No!

634
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:23,147
- Do you think I want you
wearing that stupid thing?

635
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,730
(Aimy screams)

636
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:29,952
There, there.

637
00:27:29,952 --> 00:27:32,260
Okay, it's off now.

638
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,360
Stop it, stop your crying this instant!

639
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,627
Do you hear me Aimy?

640
00:27:38,627 --> 00:27:40,183
Aimy, can you hear me?

641
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,572
- [Reporter] Whether we speak on it

642
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:45,424
in terms of a rising healthcare crisis

643
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:47,250
or an emerging disease

644
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,150
does not negate the danger
of the Apollo Plague.

645
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,650
It burrows under all conscious thought

646
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,330
and infects its host.

647
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,900
Delirium follows in later stages,

648
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,137
as well as breakdown of the muscle tissue.

- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

659
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:49,137
- Aimy, why don't you stand up

660
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:50,787
and wish Claude a happy birthday?

661
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,873
- Grandma was raised by nuns.

662
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:57,910
- Tell this wild one to sit down already.

663
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,083
- [Father] She does not
need you to reprimand her.

664
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,240
- You do not speak for me.

665
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,663
- She has so much energy,
she needs to get it all out.

666
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,270
- No more sweets, Aimy.

667
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,690
- Yes, more sweets.

668
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,720
- We are worried about your nutrition.

669
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,180
- How about that Apollo, huh?

670
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,184
I mean...

671
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,670
- Apollo is a lot of trumped up nonsense.

672
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,063
We've seen at least 50
apocalypses that have never--

673
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:21,120
- We have billions of people, coming in,

674
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,380
knocking on the door.

675
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,087
I would be taking myself, I'd
be standing outside of it,

676
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:27,635
I'd be protectin' my woman, Eleanor.

677
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:30,630
- Execute them on the
spot with blindfolds.

678
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,460
- Sit down already you disgusting brat!

679
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,982
- Will you stop telling her to sit down!

680
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,217
- Don't talk to me, don't talk to me.

681
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:41,500
- You know, it's all about the sugar.

682
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,580
It's the root to all of her problems.

683
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,609
- At least my teeth won't rot.

684
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:48,321
My teeth are fake, I can't make calcium.

685
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:49,154
(dinging)

686
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,720
- Okay, your teeth are
very impressive, Aimy,

687
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,330
but we were kinda having an
intellectual conversation here.

688
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,193
Can we please get back to that?

689
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,993
- Eleanor my love, the sugar--

690
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:59,440
- What I've read about the
Apollo is that there's no way

691
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,230
you can even test for it.

692
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,914
It can lay in someone's body for weeks.

693
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:07,489
- That would explain my irritable bowels.

694
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:10,989
(soft instrumental music)

695
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,313
- [Girl Voiceover] I think
you're acting this way

696
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,003
because you have no friends.

697
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,033
But that's okay.

698
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,203
I know that must be a really
hard way to go through life.

699
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,887
I can be your friend, Aimy.

700
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:26,887
If you want.

701
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,450
- Eleanor, of course I...

702
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:47,280
I want to get married as well.

703
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,463
Just need you to sign that paper.

704
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,890
- I'll do it after we get married.

705
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,760
- Then let's do it right now.

706
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,650
- No, no Claude, after.

707
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,780
- We can go away, we can get married.

708
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,807
- Why can't we get married first?

709
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:03,270
- 'Cause I need you to
sign this paper first.

710
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,920
- I told I would after we get married.

711
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,383
- All right, Eleanor.

712
00:31:08,587 --> 00:31:11,490
If you don't sign this
paper, I'm gonna walk

713
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,847
right out this door and
I'm gonna not come back.

714
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:16,387
You gonna sign this paper?

715
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:17,220
- No.

716
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,627
- Bye Eleanor.

717
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,727
- Oh Claude!

718
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:21,414
Come back, come back!

719
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:24,764
(Grandma sobs)

720
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:27,431
Oh McGillicutty Bob, I love you.

721
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,837
I love you.

722
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,993
I love you, I need you now.

723
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,303
Oh why did you leave me?

724
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,150
- I wish we could eat all food like this.

725
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,040
- Aimy, we're trying
to have a intellectual

726
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,210
conversation here, please.

727
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,914
- So am I.

728
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:51,747
- Aimy.

729
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,920
- Grandma was raised by nuns.

730
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,997
This is how they spanked her.

731
00:31:57,997 --> 00:31:59,030
- [Jackie] Okay...

732
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:03,100
- They beat her over and over
again on her stinkin' ass!

733
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, did Mr. Bohringer propose yet?

734
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,160
Oh he didn't?

735
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,870
Well it looks like he's not going to.

736
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,700
I guess you're gonna die alone, Grandma.

737
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,390
- Go to your room and start a written

738
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,850
apology to your grandmother.

739
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,130
- A written apology?
- Yeah.

740
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,240
- With what exactly?

741
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,590
You took away all my pens and paper.

742
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,517
- Oh, she's ruined my night.

743
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:20,350
- Fuck you!

744
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,460
- Oh yeah?

745
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,040
Yes.
- Aimy, get out.

746
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,410
- I have an announcement to make.

747
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,250
Little Aimy is adopted.

748
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,270
And do you know what else?

749
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,930
- I have the Apollo Plague!

750
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,810
- Your parents were dope addicts.

751
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:33,700
You know what else about her?

752
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,540
- I don't care, tell them.

753
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,887
We keep no secrets here
between you and me.

754
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:39,550
- She was a dumpster baby.

755
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,780
Her parents threw her in the garbage.

756
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,970
And it was the worst
thing in my whole life

757
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,780
that anyone ever found her.

758
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,930
She's the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

759
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,870
The worst thing that ever
could happen to a grandmother.

760
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,080
She's a cancer in my life, a cancer.

761
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,300
Get out!

762
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,210
Get out, Aimy!

763
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,659
- I don't wanna be here anyway.

764
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:58,492
- Good!

765
00:32:58,492 --> 00:32:59,360
- I'm leaving forever!

766
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,370
- Go!

767
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,203
- [Grandma] You're a cancer, get out!

768
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,970
- Everyone please, just calm down!

769
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,530
We have crabs!

770
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,072

A vitally important process.

781
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:06,413
- Well, how is Grandma's wild child?

782
00:34:07,593 --> 00:34:09,713
Look baby, I brought you some soup.

Look at you, tied up like a lamb.

786
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,310
At last I have a lady.

787
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,440
Her head is up, she's sitting up straight,

788
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,150
her feet are on the ground.

790
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:32,700
And you're not throwing things.

791
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,217

800
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,185
- You have nothing left to take from me.

801
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,465

802
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:07,006

883
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,560

884
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,190

885
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,797

00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,800
- You're all getting wiped
off the face of the planet.

895
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,170
- I can't even hear myself think.

896
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,260
- Stupid old lady, you're not my grandma.

897
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,390
- You killed her off.

898
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,590
Insect.

899
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,060
- Oh, and abusing little old ladies.

900
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,220
That is a new low for you, Aimy.

901
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,473
- Like I care.

902
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:23,535
Oh no!

903
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:26,488
- You know, that reminds me.

904
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:28,697
I'm gonna ask you a question
for scientific purposes.

905
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:29,530
- [Kelly] Here we go.

906
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,130
- Do you realize just how insane you are?

907
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:32,963
- Get out.

908
00:41:32,963 --> 00:41:33,796
Get out!

909
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:36,110
- Steve, you're not helping.

910
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,610
- Hey go on, eat it up.

911
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,443
Eat it up!

912
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:41,060
- Not eating a thing
out of psycho's hands.

913
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,650
- We've lost the entire
staff at my courthouse.

914
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,550
We had to let all the prisoners free.

915
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,009
- She only wants candy.

916
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:47,850
- Only wants candy?

917
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,683
Let me try.

918
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,933
You ready?

919
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,950
Oh, oh!

920
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,295
Oh, I'm so sorry.

921
00:41:56,295 --> 00:41:58,781
- Oh, that's so funny.

922
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:00,308
You're so funny!

923
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:03,135
That's so hilarious, you
guys are all so funny!

924
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,257
(laughing)

925
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:05,090
- Quiet.

926
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,673
(Aimy screams)

927
00:42:08,718 --> 00:42:10,801
- Keep going, keep going.

928
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,467
(light ambient music)

929
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,296
- Hey!

930
00:42:33,913 --> 00:42:36,120
- Mr. Bohringer, what're you doing here?

931
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,620
- [Claude] I wanted to know
somethin' from you, Aimy.

932
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,000
- It's been so long since anybody's

933
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,073
wanted to talk to me.

934
00:42:42,353 --> 00:42:45,370
- [Claude] I just need
to know, your grandmother

935
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,420
had some pieces of paper that she probably

936
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,360
needs to put in special places.

937
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,413
Where might those special places be?

938
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
- Is that all you wanted to talk about?

939
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,840
- [Claude] I just want to find out

940
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,910
about those pieces of paper.

941
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,770
I'll untie you and we can have a nice

942
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:15,660
little conversation about
atoms and quantum physics,

943
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,960
dinosaurs, and all those things that you

944
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,913
must be really interested in.

945
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,643
- You'll untie me?

946
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:24,650
- [Claude] Yeah, I just need
to know where that piece

947
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,103
of paper might be.

948
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,450
- You're not afraid
that I'm gonna run wild

949
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,970
and stab everyone?

950
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,380
- [Claude] I don't care
what the hell you do,

951
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,620
I just want to know about
those pieces of paper,

952
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,533
and then I'll untie you,
but you gotta tell me now.

953
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:41,210
- What else are we gonna talk about?

954
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:46,210
- [Claude] Dogs, cats, animals,
eyelashes, ducks, geese,

955
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,940
whatever the hell you wanna talk about.

956
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,863
Just tell me about those pieces of paper.

957
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:51,613
- You promise?
- Yes.

958
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:55,796
- Promise you'll untie me?
- Yes.

959
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,579
- I don't know for sure, but sometimes

960
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:06,510
I would see Grandma hiding things

961
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:11,383
where she used to keep McGillicutty Bob.

962
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:15,728
Mr. Bohringer, are we gonna talk?

963
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:19,964
(somber violin music)

964
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,210
- Are you ready to eat?

965
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,210
- I'm not gonna eat anything from you.

966
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:49,983
- Why not?

967
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,100
- I don't want to eat
anything from any of you.

968
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,463
- We're worried about you, Aimy.

969
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,796
You have to eat.

970
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,827
- Then I'll starve myself.

971
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,410
- That doesn't sound
like a very good idea.

972
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:14,100
If you don't eat, I'm
gonna pry your mouth open

973
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,017
and force it down your
throat like a foie gras.

974
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,150
- [Newscaster] Curfew's set for 6 pm.

975
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,940
All violators will be arrested

976
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,591
with one year minimum sentencing.

977
00:45:38,591 --> 00:45:40,160
(static hissing)

978
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,357
- I have to go home now.

979
00:45:42,357 --> 00:45:43,293
No, no!

980
00:45:43,293 --> 00:45:45,043
- Calm down!
- No, no!

981
00:45:47,031 --> 00:45:48,673
- Let me go!

982
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:49,506
Let me go!

983
00:45:51,896 --> 00:45:53,343
- Kelly, calm--

984
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:54,406
Everything's fine.

985
00:45:54,406 --> 00:45:55,685
Everything's gonna be fine.

986
00:45:55,685 --> 00:45:59,018
(discordant drum music)

987
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,833
- You okay?

988
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,150
I can feed her, no problem.

989
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,470
- She has to learn from me.

990
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,937
- Yes, but you need
sleep, look at yourself.

991
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:31,910
What're you gonna need this for?

992
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,580
You don't need this kind of stuff.

993
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,863
I can help feed her.

994
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,640
She's asleep.

995
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,473
- She's faking it.

996
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:43,320
- I don't know about that.

997
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,793
Listen, I don't care about her.

998
00:46:46,793 --> 00:46:49,610
I only care about you getting your sleep.

999
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,860
- I'll never let you guys sleep.

1000
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,190
- Aimy, just give me a second!

1001
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,450
- You're gonna have to gag
me if you ever want to sleep.

1002
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,958
I'll never let you sleep, none of you!

1003
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:59,737
- Ignore her, ignore her.

1004
00:46:59,737 --> 00:47:02,450
She's just in no state for this.

1005
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,323
(Aimy screams)

1006
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:05,460
- Stop it!

1007
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,210
Please stop it!

1008
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,377
Why won't you?

1009
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,748
- I'm never gonna eat
anything from you, you robot!

1010
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:14,287
I'm never gonna eat anything.

1011
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:17,037
(both screaming)

1012
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,910
- Hey, hey, hey.

1013
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,533
Knock it off already.

1014
00:47:26,533 --> 00:47:27,366
- Four days!

1015
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:28,910
She hasn't eaten in four days.

1016
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,013
- I'll never eat anything.

1017
00:47:31,013 --> 00:47:31,846
I'll never eat.

1018
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:34,883
I swear to God I'll starve
myself if you don't untie me.

1019
00:47:34,883 --> 00:47:36,350
- Well go right ahead, it's not like

1020
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,747
we're getting fed either.

1021
00:47:37,747 --> 00:47:40,647
- I'll kill myself if you don't untie me.

1022
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:42,064
- Go right ahead!

1023
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,647
What's up with that?

1024
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:46,800
Everyone wants to live, she wants to die.

1025
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,923
She just has to be different.

1026
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:51,663
Ken, you're gonna need the tube.

1027
00:47:53,048 --> 00:47:53,881
- I'll eat.

1028
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:55,385
I'll eat, I'll eat, I swear I'll eat.

1029
00:47:55,385 --> 00:47:56,271
I'll eat!

1030
00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:58,573
Get it off me, get it off me!

1031
00:47:58,573 --> 00:48:01,156
(Aimy screams)

1032
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,757
(sirens wailing)

1033
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,883
- [Newscaster] It blows
under all conscious thought

1034
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:30,020
that infects its host.

1035
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,420
It starts with black rings around the eyes

1036
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,630
and breakdown of the muscle tissue.

1037
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:38,510
By stage two of the disease, skin peeling,

1038
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,413
paranoia, and restlessness.

1039
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,850
- Thank you for your silence today, Aimy.

1040
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,070
It shows me that you're making an effort.

1041
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,000
That I'm getting through.

1042
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,680
- Don't you even wanna hear my offer?

1043
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,960
- No I don't wanna hear your offer.

1044
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,793
No I do not.

1045
00:48:52,793 --> 00:48:54,010
- I'm eating, I'm behaving.

1046
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,660
- From now on, it's me and you.

1047
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,300
That's it, no one else.
- Don't say that please.

1048
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,389
- I can't even negotiate with--

1049
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:01,562
- No, you're not gonna negotiate.

1050
00:49:01,562 --> 00:49:04,228
(both screaming)

1051
00:49:04,228 --> 00:49:05,743
- What's this little mutant saying now?

1052
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:06,576
- She's saying nothing.

1053
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,307
- [Father] A rehabilitated
serial killer is easier than her.

1054
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:12,043
- Stay quiet, listen to my directions,

1055
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:13,914
and I'll be good to you.

1056
00:49:13,914 --> 00:49:15,061
- I understand.

1057
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:17,100
Screw you!
- Screw you!

1058
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:21,150
- Act belligerent and
rebellious, refuse to eat,

1059
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,130
and they'll be problems between us.

1060
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,080
- I'll try my best.

1061
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,523
- People are dying, so what?

1062
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,060
Maybe they should.

1063
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,950
- Let her throw out her voice.

1064
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,803
- Enough with this back
and forth retaliation.

1065
00:49:43,803 --> 00:49:46,860
Just go get the tube,
fix it, and feed her.

1066
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,333
- Maybe they didn't have what it takes.

1067
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,130
You see, as we're being
seized by this epidemic,

1068
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,230
we're also being confronted

1069
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,366
with social Darwinism at its finest.

1070
00:49:56,366 --> 00:50:00,188
- Oh, we feel so sorry for you, Aimy.

1071
00:50:00,188 --> 00:50:02,430
Oh woe is for you.

1072
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,100
The world revolves around Aimy.

1073
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,830
- And we have to take
this as an opportunity,

1074
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,874
as a gift, to look in.

1075
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,826
- Go on, try another one.

1076
00:50:11,826 --> 00:50:12,967
Keep 'em coming.

1077
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:14,315
Keep on screaming!

1078
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:17,330
- [Newscaster] But where is the vaccine?

1079
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,330
How much longer do we have to wait?

1080
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,550
- [Announcer] They are
behind on deliveries,

1081
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,653
but there is enough food to go around.

1082

(speaking foreign language)

1087
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:35,533
- Let her scream until her throat bleeds.

1088
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,257
(speaking foreign language)

1089
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:44,932
(cymbal ringing)

1090

- Here, have some.

1091
00:51:01,173 --> 00:51:02,893
Here, you love your sweets.

1092
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,100
Here, have some sweets.

1093
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,370
- Right now, say this mantra and you will

1094
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,544
make it through this.

1095
00:51:08,544 --> 00:51:09,920
I have the courage, say it.

1096
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,130
Say it with me now.

1097
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,434
I have the courage.

(laughing)

1101
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,918
- Open your mouth.

1102
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:01,777
- No.

1103
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:03,277
- Open your mouth!

1104
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:06,156
No food?

1105
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,620
No food then, okay.

1106
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,743
Die of starvation.

1107
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:11,550

- You won't what?

1109
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:13,950
- No!

1110
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,370
- No what, crazy girl?

1111
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,203
No what?

1112
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:18,017
- No, no, no!

1113
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:21,878
- Oh, no, no, no?

1114
00:52:21,878 --> 00:52:23,097
- No!

1115
00:52:23,097 --> 00:52:25,028

1117
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:29,508
- I'm crazy!

1118
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:30,685
- Are you crazy?

1119
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:32,918
- I'm the craziest person who ever lived!

1120
00:52:32,918 --> 00:52:34,146
- She admits it!

1121
00:52:34,146 --> 00:52:36,748
- I'm the most worthless
person who ever existed!

1122
00:52:36,748 --> 00:52:38,057
- She understands!

1123
00:52:38,057 --> 00:52:41,417
- I have nothing to offer anyone!

1124
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:44,717
(light electronic music)

1125
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,017
- What could we have here?

1126
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:49,190
- [Aimy] I'll eat!

1127
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:50,449
- I don't care.

1128
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:52,398
- I'll eat!
- I don't care!

1129
00:52:52,398 --> 00:52:53,369
- Molly.

1130
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:55,310
- Get out of here Kenneth.

1131
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,360

1132
00:53:10,495 --> 00:53:11,787

00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:12,729
- No!

1134
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:14,369
- One solid beating is what she needs.

1135
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:15,202
- She ate!

1136
00:53:15,202 --> 00:53:16,035
- No, no, no!

1137
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:17,687
- One solid beating is what she needs!

1138
00:53:17,687 --> 00:53:19,888
- You never did a thing of
value in your entire life!

1139

- Get out of here Kenneth!

1140

- I can't do this anymore.

1162

She's killed my spirit.

1163
00:54:56,974 --> 00:54:57,807
- Look--

1164
00:54:57,807 --> 00:54:59,500
- I don't wanna live anymore.

1165
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,500
- Oh stop, she's just an animal.

1166
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,750
Don't let her get to you.

1167

1168
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,120
No one has to know.

1169
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,598
I just want to forget she was ever born.

This is good news.

the correct associations.

1184

- I've never had a teacher
as effective as you.

- And I have never met a girl so in need.

1186
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,993
The system completely let you down.

1187
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,883
It's astounding how you managed
to slip through the cracks.

1188
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,833
It's astounding how
lenient everyone's been.

1189
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:58,203
Your family denied the true
extent of your condition.

1190
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,253
They deny just how sick
a girl you really are.

1192
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,453

1193
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,593
Stand.

1194
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:26,450
Did you look at Steve?

1195
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,283
- I didn't.

1196
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:29,140
- Did you intentionally look at Steve?

1197
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:29,973
- I didn't!

1198
00:57:32,178 --> 00:57:34,078
- You've crossed me for the last time.

1199
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:52,468
(tense ambient music)

1200
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:54,489
Aimy!

1201
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,920
- You have to go.

1202
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,018
You have to go, you have to go,

1203
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:21,354
you have to go, you have to go,

1204
00:58:21,354 --> 00:58:24,784

1206
00:58:28,063 --> 00:58:29,826
you have to go.

1207

(cackling)

1209
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,523
It was inevitable.

1210
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,210
There's not enough food for us anymore.

1211
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,694
The authorities keep
coming in and grabbing

1212
00:58:39,694 --> 00:58:42,033
every grain of rice we get.

1213
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:47,231
And on top of all that, Kelly's pregnant.

1214
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:49,920
Isn't that fantastic?

1215
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,024
Bon voyage!

1216
00:58:51,024 --> 00:58:51,928
- Where are you taking me?

1217
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:52,761
- None of your business.

1218
00:58:52,761 --> 00:58:54,776
But I'm sure you'll love it.

1219
00:58:54,776 --> 00:58:56,639
- Oh yes, you'll love it there.

1220
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,620
We're taking you to a
place where you'll be--

1221
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,978
- Among the rats.

1222
00:58:58,978 --> 00:59:01,703
- Yes, they'll eat you alive!

1223
00:59:01,703 --> 00:59:04,905
No, no, no, we were gonna eat you,

1224
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:08,296
but we can't eat you, you're too sour...

1225
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:10,283
- Oh, she wants a hug?

1226
00:59:10,283 --> 00:59:11,700
- Yes, of course.

1227
00:59:15,128 --> 00:59:15,961
There you go.

1228
00:59:15,961 --> 00:59:17,944
- Have a great trip to hell!

1229
00:59:17,944 --> 00:59:20,037
- Why was I even born?

1230
00:59:20,037 --> 00:59:22,600
- Because even God needs a laugh.

1231
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,733
- You can't get rid of me, the neighbors

1232
00:59:23,733 --> 00:59:25,617
will hear your baby crying.

1233
00:59:25,617 --> 00:59:27,345
I can make lots of noise so you don't have

1234
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:29,020
to disguise the noise.

1235
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:29,853
- Shut up!

1236
00:59:31,557 --> 00:59:32,790
- Kelly, you're gonna miscarry.

1237
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:33,880
You're gonna bleed to death--

1238
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,313
- Know your place!

1239
00:59:35,313 --> 00:59:37,646
Know your place, crazy girl!

1240
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,117
Crawl on your knees and beg for mercy.

1241
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:48,606

1242

- Doctors, physicians,
teachers, lawyers, politicians,

1254
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:20,880
mathematicians, we all have to die,

1255
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,010
and yet you get to live.

1256
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:26,683
That's why I've decided
to give you an out.

1257
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,733
Go ahead, kill yourself.

1258
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:34,825
(laughing)

1259
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:36,427
This is hilarious.

1260
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:38,383
Hey, hey everyone.

1261
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,313
Aimy's trying to kill herself.

1262
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:48,073
Oh look at you, you're so precious.

1263
01:01:50,405 --> 01:01:53,929
- I just wanna walk!
- You wanna walk?

1264
01:01:53,929 --> 01:01:56,346
- I just want some fresh air.

1265
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,750
- How many people have
died because they wanted

1266
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,709
to take a walk?

1267
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:06,010
Kelly died because she
wanted to take a walk.

1268
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:08,933
God help anyone whoever takes a walk.

1269
01:02:17,273 --> 01:02:18,630
- Infect me.

1270
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,287
- Stay back you animal.

1271
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:23,340
- Infect me!
(knocking)

1272
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,940
- No.

1273
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,617
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1274
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:30,060
(muffled yelling)

1275
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,614
Oh no!

1276
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,197
What are you doing?

1277
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:35,985
Oh no, stop!

1278
01:02:39,424 --> 01:02:41,157
Not the upholstery!

1279
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:44,748
The upholstery, not the upholstery!

1280
01:02:44,748 --> 01:02:45,581
Don't hit the table please!

1281
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:48,313
Not the table, not the table, please!

1282
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,353
Oh no!

1283
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:52,299
Who's gonna pay for that?

1284
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,910
- Where's the women?

1285
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:56,743
- What women?

1286
01:02:58,504 --> 01:02:59,837
They want women!

1287
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:03,619
(taser buzzing)

1288
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:07,840
- Well it's beautiful day
on the town today, isn't it?

1289
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,673
I asked you...

1290
01:03:08,673 --> 01:03:11,877
You need to raise your
hands when you talk to me.

1291
01:03:11,877 --> 01:03:13,478
You do it, but don't say a word, okay?

1292
01:03:13,478 --> 01:03:15,786
That's your job now, do you understand?

1293
01:03:15,786 --> 01:03:19,700
So you keep a good close
eye on her, she might run.

1294
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,050
So we're here, we're
family, we're all friends.

1295
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,777
We broke bread, we had dinner,
and look what it got us.

1296
01:03:26,777 --> 01:03:28,000
It got us nowhere.

1297
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,838
We still don't like each other.

1298
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:32,110
The room is empty, just like my soul.

1299
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,183
I told you to take care of him now!

1300
01:03:34,183 --> 01:03:37,199
I am so tired of people just
giving me the wrong answer!

1301
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:38,199
- He's okay!

1302
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:41,700
- What the hell happened to her?

1303
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,417
- She's infected.

1304
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:45,357
- No, I'm not infected.

1305
01:03:45,357 --> 01:03:47,530
- Listen to me, she's infected.

1306
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:48,541
She's gone.

1307
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:50,741
- He's lying, I'm not infected.

1308
01:03:50,741 --> 01:03:52,239
I'm not healthy!

1309
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:53,072
- Stand back!

1310
01:03:53,072 --> 01:03:54,750
- I want this little one badly, man.

1311
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:55,757
- Just take her!

1312
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,830
- I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm so sick!

1313
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:00,860
I'm sick!

1314
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,143
- Yeah, I'm a mathematician, she's sick.

1315
01:04:02,143 --> 01:04:04,520
- Guess it's all coming
out of your rations.

1316
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,080
- Hey, I don't mean to offend anybody,

1317
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,780
but she's gonna infect you all and then

1318
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,870
you're gonna be taking it out on me.

1319
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:10,850
- Delirium, he needs to be taken.

1320
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:13,111
- No I surely disagree, I surely disagree!

1321
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:14,528
- Do not test me!

1322
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,543
- I just want to go.

1323
01:04:17,543 --> 01:04:19,890
- You're not leaving here.

1324
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:24,070
So you can get that idea
out of your head right now.

1325
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:27,810
You may not think that I can
push you back in this suit.

1326
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:32,810
It my not seem flexible,
but I assure you it is.

1327
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,083
I can box in this suit.

1328
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:39,007
We are taught different
dance moves, like ballet,

1329
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:42,538
the tap dance, and even the Charleston.

1330
01:04:42,538 --> 01:04:46,038
Pirouette, look everyone, I'm pirouetting.

1331
01:04:46,978 --> 01:04:49,070
One, two, three, four.

1332
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,691
One, two, three.

1333
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:52,350
Do you see how I'm doing it everyone?

1334
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:54,406
Can you see it?

1335
01:04:54,406 --> 01:04:55,239
It purrs!

1336
01:04:57,842 --> 01:05:01,592
(playful instrumental music)

1337
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:14,152
(soft piano music)

1338
01:08:27,262 --> 01:08:30,679
(light percussion music)
