1
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,920
911. Please identify yourself.

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,880
There's a man in my house.

3
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,880
I have a baby. He's going to kill us.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,280
Who's in the house, ma'am?
Ma'am, stay with me.

5
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,680
Please, hurry!

6
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,680
God, he's coming!

7
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,680
He's coming.

8
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,080
Possible homicide in progress.
Mother and infant.

9
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,960
Dispatch all vehicles in the area.
Ma'am, stay with me.

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,760
No! No!

11
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,320
Why are you doing this?

12
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
You're a bad mother.

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,560
''Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,280
''When the wind blows, the cradle will rock

15
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,240
''When the bough breaks
the cradle will fall

16
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,800
''And down will come baby

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,240
''Cradle and all''

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,040
Let me finish your nightmare, kid.

19
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,520
What's your status? ls SWAT here yet?

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Secure your perimeter.

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,280
-What are you waiting for?
-SWAT team.

22
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,600
They'll be all night. Take the stairs.

23
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,440
We've got smoke in here.

24
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,720
lt's him.

25
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Go!

26
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
Don't shoot, please!

27
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,720
-ls anybody else in there?
-No!

28
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,000
Get them downstairs! Go!

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,160
-Get them out!
-Check it!

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,760
-We've got to wait for the fire trucks.
-Absolutely. Shit!

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,560
Get those windows open. Go on!

32
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,160
Come on! Move it!

33
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,800
Come on, baby!

34
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
Go!

35
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
Come on, baby.

36
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,120
l'm okay. Get out of here!

37
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,120
What in hell are you doing?

38
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,560
lt's okay.

39
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,440
Take the baby. Get him to the hospital.
Make sure he's okay.

40
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,440
Suspect is a white male,
heading north on Hauser on foot...

41
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,560
...wearing a black leather coat.

42
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,720
Hold it there!

43
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,000
Stop the bus! Open up!

44
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
-What's going on?
-Sorry, folks.

45
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,760
Just a routine check.
Nothing to be alarmed about.

46
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,720
What's going on?

47
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,720
Sorry for the inconvenience.

48
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Everybody up! Against the window.
Don't look at me!

49
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,400
Freeze!

50
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,080
Be afraid, Jake.

51
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,240
Be very afraid.

52
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,280
Almost had him. l had him!

53
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,480
Well, that's not your problem anymore.

54
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,320
As of an hour ago, you're officially retired.

55
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
l know.

56
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,840
When they find the car
they should check for blood.

57
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,480
Shut up, okay. lt's not your case anymore.

58
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,680
l popped him one. Check for blood.

59
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,040
You just couldn't leave quietly, huh?

60
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,160
You know, l wanted
one last inspiring lecture from you.

61
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,000
Ten years, you've heard them all.

62
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,080
A lot of good it's done. But, before you go,
the feds are here. They want to talk.

63
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
To me? Of course, they do.

64
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,520
Gentlemen.

65
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
-Stan Reisman. How are you?
-Fine. What do you want?

66
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,360
-l understand you're leaving the force.
-That's right.

67
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,080
-We'd like to offer you a job.
-No, thanks. Don't need one.

68
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,160
We can help you catch him.
He will kill again.

69
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,760
Last night,
the Torch claimed his 11th victim.

70
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,360
This elusive serial killer
has remained at large...

71
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,640
...for over three years,
preying on mothers...

72
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
...throughout the Seattle area.

73
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,680
Detective Jake Riley who has headed up
the case had this to say about the Torch.

74
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,120
How's it to be leaving
with the Torch case unsolved?

75
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,160
No comment.

76
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,640
-Has he called you?
-No comment.

77
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,080
Is this brilliant killer
the reason you're quitting?

78
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,320
I'm retiring for personal reasons.
It's got nothing to do with it.

79
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,120
-Come on. Give us something.
-I'll give you something.

80
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,600
Our big bad bogeyman is nothing more
than a bed-wetting mama's boy.

81
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,880
That's right.
He pisses himself all the time.

82
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,360
Pathetic really. Just a sick pervert.
Is that enough for you?

83
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,800
-Did you get that?
-Did we get that?

84
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,400
Did you get that?

85
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,120
-Darling, telephone for you.
-Oh, thanks, Mom.

86
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,680
Yeah?

87
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,160
That was a nasty thing
you said about me on TV.

88
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,640
Oh, yeah? You're just a little too sensitive.

89
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,080
I don't want you calling me anymore.
I'm retired.

90
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,240
You can quit, but you'll never get rid of me.

91
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,840
I'm too smart.

92
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, Mommy must be proud
of her little psycho.

93
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,440
Stop it. Look at yourself.

94
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,040
Three years trying to catch me.
But you failed. You're a bad cop.

95
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,600
Do you think quitting would stop me?

96
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm going to keep on killing, asshole.

97
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,440
-You're a real loser.
-Fuck you, you fucking prick!

98
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,920
l'm gonna track you down
like a fucking dog!

99
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,720
You understand, you son of a bitch?

100
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,600
Fuck youI

101
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,400
Fuck you, too, Jake.

102
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,720
lt's always the same M.O.
with slight variations.

103
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,840
Single mother. Mole.
Burns them postmortem.

104
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,160
We've got partial prints.
Trace evidence. Blood type, even.

105
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,360
-But still no Torch.
-No shit.

106
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,400
Tell me something l don't know.

107
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,600
We fed enormous amounts
of data on the Torch...

108
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,400
...into our ViCAP supercomputer.
We've come up with a white male.

109
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,440
Thirties. Very physical.

110
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,960
Step up to the mark.

111
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,440
Welcome, Jacob Riley.

112
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,040
The Martucci slayings, a year ago.

113
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,360
We found a hair follicle belonging to him.
lt was enough for a DNA imprint.

114
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,200
Take a closer look.

115
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,440
-Okay. So this is a clone of the killer?
-A replicant.

116
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,360
God created man in six days.
We took longer.

117
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,600
-Since when is the FBl--
-We're not FBl.

118
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,280
We're National Security Force.

119
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,840
We really don't care
about your serial killer.

120
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,360
Originally, this was developed
for national security. Counter-terrorism.

121
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,280
Today's intelligence
has failed to weed out terrorists.

122
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,920
Okay. Go on.

123
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,120
Our goal is to create replicants
that can lead us to them.

124
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,520
l understand.

125
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,520
He's not a terrorist, though.

126
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,400
No. But the behaviour patterns are similar.

127
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,600
So, why me?

128
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,760
Because he picked you.

129
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,880
What do you mean he picked me?

130
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
When he's ready you'll take custody.
You'll care for him.

131
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,760
Help him develop. Then you'll see
if he can lead you to the killer.

132
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,600
Wouldn't it be easier
just to plaster his face on TV?

133
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,720
This project is classified. No pictures.
No conventional techniques.

134
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,920
All you have is Replicant.

135
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,600
What's going on?

136
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
A counter-reaction.
He's rejecting the latest growth hormone.

137
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,240
-Talk to me. What can we do?
-V-fib! Flatline!

138
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,080
Get him out. Now!

139
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,040
Welcome to my world.

140
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,520
Motherfucker.

141
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,440
Good morning, Number One.

142
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,400
Time to wake up.

143
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,520
Today, we're going to cover the basics:
How to sit...

144
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,160
...stand, walk and stop.

145
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,760
Now I'm walking.

146
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,680
I'm sitting.

147
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,640
I'm standing.

148
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,560
I'm Miss Johnson. How are you?

149
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,480
Did you hurt yourself?

150
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,920
Maybe your golden boy's retarded.

151
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,440
Physical readings are normal,
but the brain sign waves are low.

152
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,560
We've enhanced his telepathic ability
through genome resequencing.

153
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,800
He may be our first, but genetic memory
has been scientifically proven.

154
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,840
He just needs human stimuli.

155
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,880
That's the toilet.

156
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,560
That's where you come in:
first human contact.

157
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,480
Good try. Watch the video and try again.

158
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,040
-lmpressive, isn't he?
-He's exceeding expectations.

159
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,160
You guys are pretty happy with yourselves,
aren't you?

160
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
You have no idea
what you're getting into there.

161
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,760
l've seen what he's able to do
firsthand to 1 1 women.

162
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,040
lf this thing turns out to be anything
like the original, we're gonna regret it.

163
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,000
At the end of the day,
Replicant is disposable.

164
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,920
Take it easy.

165
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,520
Food.

166
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,440
Eat!

167
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,400
l'm Jake.

168
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,600
You like that? How about this?

169
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,320
How's that?

170
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,760
Here, here.

171
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,640
Okay. Here. Look at that.

172
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,560
You like that?

173
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,040
Strong, huh? Easy! Take it easy!

174
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,480
Take it easy!

175
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Back up! Back!

176
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,200
Easy! Back!

177
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,480
Now, sit!

178
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,480
Sit!

179
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,400
l'm standing.

180
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
l'm walking.

181
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,960
l'm sitting.

182
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,200
Standing.

183
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,440
I'm walking.

184
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,120
I'm sitting.

185
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,360
-I'm standing.
-StayI

186
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,440
No. Walk.

187
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Move. Let's go.

188
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,160
Give me your glasses.

189
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,440
-Those are $500 sunglasses.
-Yeah?

190
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,200
Look.

191
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,080
Thank you.

192
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,560
Do l get an owner's manual
on this guy, or what?

193
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,800
You do whatever it takes
to awaken the killer inside.

194
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,240
Here are your temporary NSF papers.
And your gun.

195
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,880
-Got it.
-l want a report every 12 hours.

196
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,680
Okay. Let's go. Walk!

197
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
Sit.

198
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,000
Sleeping killer. How sweet.

199
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
We've got company.

200
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,560
Okay, freak-of-science.

201
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Let's talk a little shop here, shall we?
What do you remember?

202
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,960
What do you remember? Come on.

203
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Are you a killer? You feel like killing?

204
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,720
Killing somebody other than a woman?
Show me how you did it.

205
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,320
Show me how you did it, come on.

206
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,280
Show me how you fucking did it.

207
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,560
Remember that?

208
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,040
Take it.

209
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,600
Here.

210
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Want to kill me? Here's your chance.

211
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,120
Do it.

212
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,760
Do it.

213
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,920
Do it.

214
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,520
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

215
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,040
Three stooges to the rescue.

216
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,920
Stay calm. Do not shoot the subject.
Jake, tell him to back off!

217
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,280
Just shoot him. Kill him.

218
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,840
-Goddamn it, Jake.
-Okay, boys. Take it easy.

219
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,760
Maybe if you put your guns down,
he'll do the same.

220
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,800
That's good.

221
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,760
You deliberately jeopardised
a classified project. We're taking him back.

222
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,920
Good riddance.

223
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,240
He's useless.

224
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
-Very nice.
-You broke my arm!

225
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,000
You shouldn't have showed him
the moves!

226
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,280
No!

227
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,320
Hurts, don't it?

228
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
-Freeze!
-No!

229
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,880
Million-dollar project!
No shooting, remember?

230
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,440
Put it away!

231
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,960
That's it. Put it away!

232
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,160
Stay! No!

233
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,280
Stay!

234
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,920
Here.

235
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,440
Sit.

236
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
Stay.

237
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,000
Good.

238
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,400
l'll call you a cab. Walk.

239
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,600
Walk.

240
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,640
Yeah, hi.

241
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,280
l'd like an appointment
to see the house on Berkeley.

242
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,560
-My name is Jake Riley.
-Drop the gun!

243
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,080
Shut up!

244
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,120
Excuse me?

245
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,240
Sorry. lt was the radio.

246
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,840
Half hour. Great. Thank you.

247
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,760
You know this place?

248
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,560
A year ago, you made it
the most famous house in the country.

249
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,200
Real messy.

250
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Come on! Get back! Calm the fuck down.

251
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,440
You hear me? Calm the fuck down.

252
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,040
Okay. Let's go.

253
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,320
lt's just rain. Come on.

254
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,720
How about this weather? Jake Riley?

255
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,480
Wendy Wyckham.

256
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,680
Calm the fuck down.

257
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,920
No.

258
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,200
Sorry. My cousin Ron is a little special.

259
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,800
-Let me show you in.
-Be good! Come on.

260
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,440
This house was built in 1926.

261
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,960
All the woodwork is original.

262
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,960
A nice cosy fireplace here makes
the entrance that much more special.

263
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,680
Over here, we have a spacious living room.

264
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,760
This way.

265
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,000
Here, we go into the kitchen
which has recently been remodelled.

266
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,440
All the marble, of course,
imported from Florence.

267
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,080
And over here, we have the dining room.
lt's perfect for entertaining.

268
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,520
What line of work did you say you were in?

269
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,120
l was in law enforcement.

270
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,840
That's right. You're that TV cop.
The Torch case.

271
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,960
l feel so much better.

272
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,440
-You know the history of the house?
-Yes, l do.

273
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,160
You know, it's such a shame
because most people can never get past it.

274
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,600
But it is a steal.

275
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,760
Way below market value.

276
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,080
-ls he okay?
-Could you give us a minute, please?

277
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,760
Absolutely.

278
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,320
Let's go.

279
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,800
Walk.

280
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,800
Let's go.

281
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,080
What do you remember?

282
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,800
What? What is it? What do you see?

283
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,200
-Has he been here before?
-ln another life.

284
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,160
Let's go.

285
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,400
l don't want to go home.
l want to go to the park! Now!

286
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,360
Johnny, stop it! You're a bad boy.

287
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,960
-How you doing, kiddo?
-Good.

288
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,600
Come on! Jump up!

289
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,000
Up you go!

290
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,440
How you doing? You've been a good boy?

291
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,120
Up you go!

292
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,160
-How's things going?
-Good! Mommy's making your favourite.

293
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,600
l like that.

294
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,080
Go give Mommy a hug for me. Go!

295
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,960
Be good.

296
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,560
Danny, go on upstairs, okay?
And take Scout with you.

297
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,440
-Okay?
-Scout, come!

298
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,040
Come on.

299
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,280
Sit. Down.

300
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,880
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

301
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Classified. lf l told you l'd have to kill you.

302
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,600
That's not funny.

303
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,520
Sorry, l know. Listen, l need your help.

304
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,000
l've got to get a rendering of this guy
as soon as possible.

305
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,920
l'm not going to do that for you.

306
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,160
That's against department policy.
Remember?

307
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,720
That's why it's considered a favour.

308
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,520
That's gross! Don't eat that!

309
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,120
That's for doggies. Here. Try this.

310
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,680
Want some more?

311
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,040
You're supposed to say, ''Thank you.''

312
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,880
What happened?

313
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,040
Baby, what happened?

314
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,080
Come here. Get up!

315
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,680
You son of a bitch!
What did you do to him?

316
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,640
Scout hit me in the tooth.

317
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,400
lt was Scout? Wait a second.

318
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Stop! lt wasn't him.

319
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,640
Scout knocked his tooth out.
lt was the dog. lt wasn't him.

320
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,160
What happened?

321
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,720
l kicked the shit out of him.
Honest mistake.

322
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,080
lt's been 18 hours. You've gone AWOL,
let him attack my men...

323
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,960
...and now you're telling me
you've mistreated my replicant?

324
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,760
-Perhaps l made an error in judgment.
-Perhaps you did.

325
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,520
Perhaps you should take your experiment
and go. l don't need your shit.

326
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,520
After what the Torch said to you,
l thought you'd really want to nail him.

327
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,400
How do you know what he said to me?

328
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,200
You got my place wired, is that it?

329
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,360
How did you know where we were today?

330
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,200
You tracking us, too?

331
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,840
You think we'd let you out
with the future of our national security...

332
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,960
...without knowing everything about you?

333
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,360
l expect a report every 12 hours.

334
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,120
No exceptions.

335
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,760
-ls that you?
-Yeah, it's me, Mom.

336
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,440
Get your clothes off.

337
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,280
That's it. Good. Stay!

338
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,600
Not in the car. Too obvious.

339
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,800
Let's see.

340
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,280
lnternal, is that it? Open.

341
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,920
lnternal tracking device.
They think they're real smart.

342
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,240
lnternal. Smart, isn't it?

343
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,040
lt's okay. Calm down.

344
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
What are you doing?

345
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,480
l'm working, Ma.

346
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,800
lt's okay. lt's not what you think.

347
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,480
Let's go, Ma.

348
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,760
Jacob!

349
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,760
-What?
-That man was beaten up.

350
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,360
Ma, you don't even know the guy, okay.

351
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,560
Wait a minute! l'm talking about you.

352
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,640
What is the matter with you?
What has happened?

353
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,760
-What's wrong with you?
-Why are you treating people like that?

354
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,760
Mom, stop. Please.

355
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,640
Okay. But remember one thing:

356
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,520
lf you treat people like criminals,
that is exactly what they will become.

357
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,560
Your dinner's in the fridge.
l'm going home.

358
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,840
Thank you.

359
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,240
I can't take itI

360
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,120
You have ruined my life.

361
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,600
Where are you?

362
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,480
Bad boyI

363
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,640
You must be punishedI

364
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,440
You're a bad mother.

365
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,080
Hey, you all right?

366
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,960
Leave her alone!

367
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,520
Easy, man.

368
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,240
Thanks for the favour. l owe you one now.

369
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,080
Forget about it.

370
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,480
Right here. Stay.

371
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,680
Subject loaded.

372
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,120
Okay, let's see what you remember.

373
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,000
How about this one?

374
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,760
Remember that one?

375
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,400
Come on, talk to me.

376
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,640
The picture's scanned.
Make it snappy, all right?

377
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
Sit down. Go on, sit.

378
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,920
''Edward Garrotte.''

379
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,120
Outstanding.
''lmmigrated from South Africa, 1995.''

380
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,880
-Jake?
-Captain, how's the market?

381
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,720
Well, oil prices are down.

382
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,320
What the hell are you doing here?

383
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,920
l was just cleaning up some files.
All done now.

384
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,440
-Are you jerking me around?
-No, got to go.

385
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,160
You're jerking me?

386
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,200
Shut up.

387
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,080
Son of a bitch.

388
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,800
Stay.

389
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,960
Let's go.

390
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Jesus Christ.

391
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,760
Next victim.

392
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,840
Keep it.

393
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,320
Jake, we have an illegal entry.

394
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,040
This is one sick puppy.

395
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,280
The Torch. You got him.

396
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,040
-That's him in the car.
-No. l'll explain later.

397
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,200
Jake, l've got to call this one in.

398
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,880
You...

399
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,840
...back off!

400
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,520
Get out! Go!

401
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,520
Call for help.

402
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,600
Are you okay?

403
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,040
Where is he? He knew.

404
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,560
Jake! What the hell's going on?

405
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,760
-What's going on?
-Not now! l'm gonna lose him.

406
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,840
That's the Torch.
You got the Torch in the car.

407
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,840
No, it's not him. He's the key.

408
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,440
-l got to find him.
-Jake, wait a minute!

409
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,640
Who the fuck are you?

410
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,600
Who the fuck are you?

411
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,920
Break it up!

412
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,600
Back off.

413
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,800
No more phone calls.

414
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,640
Who are you? What do you want?

415
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,120
What do you want?

416
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,400
You asshole!

417
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,600
l lost him. How is he?

418
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,680
How is he?

419
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,160
You've been lying to me.

420
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,200
Gunfire reported at Martini's Lounge,
9th and Renfrew.

421
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,240
Caucasian male, black leatherjacket.
Any units in the area....

422
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,920
That's two blocks away.

423
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,880
There were two guys fighting
and they shot my boss.

424
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,080
Then they took off.

425
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,440
Calm down.

426
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,160
Two guys. ldentical twins.

427
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,680
-They were fighting.
-Stay here!

428
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,720
The janitor said that it was
two identical twins fighting.

429
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,360
ldentical twins.

430
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,040
Go. Straight.

431
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,400
Yeah?

432
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,960
I'm proud of you. You're alive.

433
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,320
Who is he?

434
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,000
You're so smart, figure it out for yourself.

435
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,360
l will.

436
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,440
It will be my biggest challenge yet.

437
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,600
Watch where you're going.

438
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,360
Hey, buddy. Come on, beat it.

439
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,320
Get out of here.
Yeah, you. Get out of here.

440
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,680
Hello, Jake. How's my replicant?

441
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,960
Fine. Shits and pisses in the toilet.

442
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,120
Wants to get laid.

443
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,680
Hasn't killed anybody yet, though.

444
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,640
You know what I mean.

445
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,640
Yeah, l do.

446
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,280
And, yeah...

447
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,240
...something's happening.
I think he's remembering stuff.

448
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,520
Excellent. What can we do
to accelerate the process?

449
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,400
Nothing.

450
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,400
He's doing fine just on his own.

451
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,880
But l've chosen a different approach.

452
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,880
Yeah? What's that?

453
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,240
You don't know?

454
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,120
You don't know where we are right now?

455
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,920
Aren't you still tracking us?

456
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,640
4901 LaSalle.

457
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,240
That's the red-light district.

458
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,600
That's right.

459
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,400
Hey, baby, what's the hurry?

460
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,080
Like what you see?

461
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,000
Let's take a walk.

462
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,160
Come on.

463
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:25,960
Come on.

464
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,840
Make yourself comfortable.

465
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,280
So, what's it gonna be?

466
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,800
Have a seat.

467
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,920
Let's just take this off.

468
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,920
There we go.

469
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,920
Okay, we can do that.

470
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,720
Okay, that's all the freebies, baby.
Now l've got to see the green.

471
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,720
Okay. Look, l said $100. Pay up.

472
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,320
$100. Pay up.

473
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,680
l said $100. Pay up!

474
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,120
What are you doing?

475
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,560
Let me go! Get the fuck off of me!

476
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,400
Let me go! No!

477
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,440
Yeah, l got me a deadbeat.

478
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,360
What the hell is wrong with you?

479
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,240
ls this your first time?

480
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,200
Oh, shit.

481
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,600
Look, l had no idea.

482
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,000
Let's say it never happened, okay? Go!

483
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,480
Come on. Go!

484
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,680
Stop it.

485
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,760
Stop it! Go!

486
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,360
We got a problem with payment?

487
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,920
l'm here to collect.

488
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,520
Leave him be.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

489
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,920
Shut up! You like this guy or what?

490
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,760
You know the fucking rules, don't you?

491
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,880
l've had enough.

492
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:22,440
Stop it! Leave him alone! Please!

493
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,800
Police! Don't move!

494
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,160
-Get down! Freeze!
-Don't shoot!

495
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,000
Get down, now! Get down!

496
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,360
Get down!

497
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,600
You men. Easy, boys.

498
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,560
-Come on, man!
-What's going on, Jake?

499
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,600
lt's okay. He's with me. l'll get him.

500
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,040
Okay. Take it easy. Relax. Sit down.

501
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,400
He's all right. You'll be okay.
Go with him.

502
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,400
l brought you your coat.

503
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,640
Look me up when you get out, okay?

504
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,200
Come on.

505
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,680
What is it you remember?
Help me out, buddy. Think.

506
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,680
Remember.

507
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,000
That's it.

508
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,160
Bad boy.

509
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,680
Bad boy? What do you mean ''bad boy''?

510
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,960
Hello, Mama.

511
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,160
Remember the mothers?
The killing of the mothers?

512
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,000
Come on, talk to me.
What do you remember?

513
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,200
Remember.

514
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,280
Look at this picture.
Do you know this woman?

515
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,040
-Get the rendering?
-No DMV or passport.

516
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,560
-She's got to be a tourist or something.
-Shit. ls she next?

517
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,080
-Look at this picture.
-Is she next?

ls she next?

519
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:39,080
''Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock

520
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,400
''When the bough breaks
the cradle will fall''

521
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,120
What do you see?

522
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,240

Jake, who am l?

526
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,360
You are a genetic double.

527
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,600
Genetic double.

528
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,000
l don't understand it either, buddy, but....

529
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,800
Your other half, he's a killer.

530
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,080
No.

531
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,280
Hop in.

532
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,240
lt's all yours.

533
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,600
Feel good?

534
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,840
Good.

535
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,040
lce cream.

536
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,640
There you go.

537
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,280
There you go.
You got to do me a favour here.

538
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,680
l want you to look at that.

539
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,680
You know that girl?

540
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,880
What are you thinking?

541
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,520
Here, no.

542
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,160
Draw up here. That's good, up there.

543
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,720
l don't know. House?

544
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,240
Church? What?

545
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,160
Go ahead.

546
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,720
l got it.

547
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,800
l know.

548
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,600
Can you tell me if she's staying here?

549
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,040
Excuse me?

550
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,000
ls she a guest in the hotel?

551
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,320
Who are you?
A police officer? You have lD?

552
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,400
lt doesn't matter who l am.
She's in danger.

553
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,160
l'm very sorry, sir,
but hotel regulations strictly forbid....

554
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,520
Excuse me.

555
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,400
Sir, you're not permitted upstairs
unless accompanied by hotel staff.

556
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,160
Okay, l understand that.

557
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,360
l'm calling Security. Get out. Get out!

558
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,880
Stay!

559
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,800
Shit!

560
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,440
Open the door. Come on!

561
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,000
Make your call!

562
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,000
We have a fire, 1404.
l repeat, we have a fire, 1404.

563
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,800
Here. Go!

564
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,520
ls he close?

565
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,920
Close.

566
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,760
What are you doing? Get back.

567
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,640
Get over here and open the door!

568
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,320
Open the door, damn you!

569
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,600
Open the fucking door! Open the door!

570
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,120
Get back here and open the door, now.

571
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,800
Get over here!

572
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,520
Stop and get over here right now!

573
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,480
Get back here, you asshole!

574
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,520
Damn it!

575
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,280
You received my message.

576
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,800
What are you?

577
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,640
Genetic double.

578
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,560
A clone?

579
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,760
Un-fucking-believable. Fantastic.

580
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,200
Beautiful.

581
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,480
My exact replica.

582
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,520
We are the same.

583
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,440
Same?

584
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,360
Yeah. My body is your body.

585
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,880
My mind is your mind.

586
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,520
My life is your life.

587
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,840
But, my brother, Jake cannot be trusted.

588
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,280
He's going to kill you.

589
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,880
l'll protect you, my brother.

590
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,160
Brother.

591
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,520
Where are you?

592
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,680
We are identical.

593
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,360
-Get out of the way!
-ldentical.

594
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,280
Get out of the way!

595
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,640
Get out of the way!

596
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,680
Move!

597
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,480
You let him get away!

598
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,280
We are the same.

599
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,240
l should have shot you both.

600
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,400
Goddamn you!
He's screwing with your mind!

601
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,960
Will Jake kill me?

602
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,600
Will Jake kill me? We are the same.

603
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,920
Will Jake kill me?

604
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,040
-We are the same.
-Shut up!

605
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,160
-Jake, are you on the case?
-NoI

606
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,040
-Are you back on the force?
-I'm retired.

607
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,880
Can you say something better than that?

608
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,000
Look, this is an individual
who refuses to take responsibility.

609
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,640
As far as I know,
he's not taking responsibility.

610
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,560
He's a fucking nutcase, that's all.

611
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,880
l've been waiting for your call.

612
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,600
I know. How's your whiskey?

613
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,720
lt's fine.

614
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,160
How's my replicant?

615
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,520
He's good.

616
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,600
Put us on the speakerphone.

617
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,720
Why would l want to do that?

618
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,400
We can talk, like family.
I want both of you to hear me.

619
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,320
Go ahead and talk.

620
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,480
I want him to know how much I love him.

621
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,240
What it means to me
to have him in this world.

622
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,600
How nice.

623
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,680
Psycho love.

624
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,800
So, do you want to know
who's my next victim?

625
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,760
Ask my brother.

626
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,440
Jake.

627
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,280
What are you waiting for?

628
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,040
In time, Jake.

629
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,720
ln time.

630
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,160
Give me a reason,
l'll blow your fucking head off.

631
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,080
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

632
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,800
-Hello, Mr. Savard.
-Hi, Carol.

633
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,000
-How's Mama today?
-Well, she's had better days.

634
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,160
-Maybe you can cheer her up.
-l've got a surprise for her.

635
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,440
Good.

636
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,760
And this one.

637
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,280
l cut her good. Very slow.

638
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,880
l wish you were there.

639
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,040
She was begging.

640
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,560
Screaming.

641
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:13,160
Bad boy, you must be punishedI Bad boyI

642
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,960
But you know what?

643
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,000
l did it for you.

644
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,120
You bad boy!

645
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,600
You must be punishedI

646
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,960
No.

647
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,320
No more, you bitch.

648
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,040
No more.

649
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,560
You should never have been bornI

650
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,240
Luc Savard.

651
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,920
Luc Savard.

652
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,520
Jake, I got it. Luc Savard.

653
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,480
Jesus, talk about a bad boy.
Shoplifting at 11...

654
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,280
...grand-theft auto, narcotics, arson.

655
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,480
He enlisted in the corps in '88.

656
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,160
Reportedly killed
behind enemy lines in June of '91.

657
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,280
But the body was never recovered.

658
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,800
And I tracked down his mother.

659
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,040
Gwendolyn Savard. She was committed
to the Nepenthe Home...

660
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,160
...six years ago, after a stroke.

661
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,640
One other thing:

662
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,160
This woman killed her husband.

663
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,320
She locked the kid up in a closet
and then set the house on fire.

664
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,720
Luc Savard only lived
because it rained that night.

665
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,080
Mr. Savard?

666
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,160
We tried to call you last night.

667
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,600
-He was here last night?
-Of course.

668
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,920
l'm sorry, your mother....

669
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,960
She had a sudden cardiac arrest.
We did everything we could.

670
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,960
She was just too frail.

671
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,920
Her things.

672
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,440
Excuse me.

673
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,400
-May we see the body?
-Yes. Of course.

674
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,320
Take it easy, Jake.

675
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,840
You want her to die? Do you?

676
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,240
Your gun, drop it.

677
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,360
Drop your gun.

678
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,520
Good.

679
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,960
You're not so smart.

680
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,200
You never saw me coming.

681
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,360
This is it, Jake.

682
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,400
You're going to die.

683
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,200
So, what's the matter, Jake?

684
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,760
No smart comeback?

685
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,080
No reporters to joke with?

686
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,440
He's not your family.

687
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,960
He doesn't care about you.

688
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,040
But l do. That's why l want you with me.

689
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,600
l have an idea.

690
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,400
You're gonna kill him.

691
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,720
Do it.

692
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,080
Finish him.

693
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,920
Yeah.

694
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,480
No.

695
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,720
That's why you're going to die with him.

696
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,520
And they'll think you are me.

697
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,360
You are a bad boy, Luc Savard.

698
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,760
What did you say?

699
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,040
You are a bad boy, Luc Savard.

700
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,880
You killed Mama.

701
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,680
Yes.

702
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,800
That's right. And so what? lt felt good.

703
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,800
You bitch!

704
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,640
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

705
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,720
Don't move. l'll be back.

706
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,520
There he is!

707
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,520
-Where is he?
-He's down there.

708
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,840
Damn!

709
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,680
Not bad for a mama's boy?

710
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,880
Should l call the news now or later?

711
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:56,840
Stop it.

712
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,920
lf you kill me, you kill yourself.

713
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,680
The safety, Luc Savard.

714
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,440
What makes you think you can take me?

715
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,200
l can read your mind.

716
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,520
Look at me. Come on, buddy.

717
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,840
-Look at me.
-Jake.

718
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,880
My family's gone.

719
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,560
He's not your family.

720
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:42,680
l'm your family. l'm your family now.

721
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,120
Jake, l see rain...

722
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,720
...in my eyes.

723
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,440
l see rain.

724
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,640
Open up!

725
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,160
Open the door!

726
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,960
Open the goddamn door!

727
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,560
Well, the only ones who made it
were the corpses in the fridge drawers.

728
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,640
l expect a full report.

729
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,360
Danny, you may be in first
but l'm better than you.

730
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,400
No.

731
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,080
No, l'm in first. Who's the best?

732
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,760
Me!

733
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,760
-Did you see the delivery-man?
-No.

734
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,600
Let's go get it.

735
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,760
He likes rain.

736
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,440
-Hi.
-Hi.

737
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,840
l knew you'd come back.

738
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,200
Let's get out of here. Let's go.
