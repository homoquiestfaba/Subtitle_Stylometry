1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:03,403
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,351
(somber music)

3
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,472
(suspenseful music)

4
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,219
(explosion echoing)

5
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,222
(suspenseful music)

6
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,043
(explosion echoing)

7
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,046
(suspenseful music)

8
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,658
- You know, the service
ain't what it used to be.

9
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,894
My grandpa was killed
in the First World War,

10
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,630
and my Dad fought in the Second.

11
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,234
And, everybody was drafted,

12
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,637
so you all felt fucked by fate
and united in the trenches.

13
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,409
We weren't really
killing people,

14
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,979
as much as saving America.

15
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,784
Being a war hero was the
only thing you could do

16
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,820
to make your front page news,

17
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,389
assuming you couldn't
join the Yankees like,

18
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,491
like you thought you
would in high school.

19
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,096
My turn came in Vietnam.

20
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,100
Well, you've seen the movies,

21
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,104
and they are definitely better
than the book on that one.

22
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,876
- [Doctor] You fought in
the Gulf too, didn't you?

23
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,211
- Fought?

24
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,646
We sat on our sweaty
ass for months,

25
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,147
and then we drove in

26
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,715
and saw a bunch of dead
people rotting in the sun.

27
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,451
Jesus, we were janitors.

28
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,822
All the horror, none of
the fun of real battle.

29
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,496
Where was I?
- Vietnam.

30
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,232
- Oh, yeah.

31
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,034
See, I felt like we just
became killers there.

32
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,470
You had to be, because there
wasn't any plan of attack.

33
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,840
Hah, just a bunch of helicopters
and screaming civilians.

34
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,277
And you knew you'd done
things down in the mud,

35
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,879
so you just started
hating everything

36
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,348
that didn't have to play
by the same lousy rules.

37
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,552
It was cool to get high
and let your hair grow.

38
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,390
Kill some lousy bastards
in the meantime.

39
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,859
(watch ticking)

40
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:31,331
Hmph, I got blasted on
sake and cocaine one night.

41
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,565
A buddy told me that

42
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,133
Charlie could hear your
watch ticking at night

43
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,102
and find your position.

44
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,036
I believed him.

45
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,372
I threw my watch away, ha ha.

46
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,908
Never wore one since.

47
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,311
The tan line never went away.

48
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,915
Does that mean anything?

49
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,686
- [Doctor] Just look at it
as your scar from Vietnam.

50
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,322
- Yeah, I know I was lucky.

51
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,990
Didn't need a watch
there, anyway.

52
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,160
The only time I cared about

53
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,762
was time to get the
hell out of Vietnam.

54
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,164
Turned out nobody here
ever cared about winning.

55
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,168
Then, finally they decided
they just wanted us home.

56
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,340
Well, that was sure
as shit okay by me,

57
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,811
but it wasn't exactly
like riding into Paris

58
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,713
and having flowers
throw at your feet.

59
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,549
- [Doctor] Tilt
your head forward.

60
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,822
(electronic squelching)

61
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:33,025
- Ah, so, I think
happy thoughts?

62
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,827
- [Doctor] It won't
affect the test.

63
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,038
- You see, that's just
it, doesn't even matter.

64
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:46,873
It used to.

65
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,675
Army, the Corps, the Service,

66
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,879
it's all a guy like me has got.

67
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,349
I don't hardly know it any more.

68
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,717
(beeps)

69
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,186
It's all changed, and
all for the worst.

70
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,756
- [Doctor] Almost done,

71
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,859
except for the drop your
pants and cough part.

72
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,528
- Did I say
everything was worse?

73
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,431
Ugh ...

74
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,968
(coughs)

75
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,437
I can do it again if you like.

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,871
- And you could,

77
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,107
but one of us might consider
it sexual harassment.

78
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,508
- Harassment?

79
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,043
We used to call it flirting.

80
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,646
- There's nothing funny about
sexual harassment, Commander.

81
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,648
- That's what I
was saying, Doctor.

82
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,117
Or should I say, uh, Captain?

83
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,853
- Come on, we're late.

84
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,797
(ominous music)

85
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,770
- Well, then, come
on, did he check out?

86
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,338
- He seems kinda depressed.

87
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,873
I don't know, I'm
no psychologist.

88
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,208
- I don't care about that.

89
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,976
- Well, then, absolutely.

90
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,277
I'm fine, too, by the way.

91
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,378
- I already knew that.

92
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,416
Come on, then, she's
waiting for us.

93
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,419
(suspenseful music)

94
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:13,626
♪ Ah ♪

95
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,530
♪ Ah ♪

96
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,668
- You perform maneuvers
through a roving drone target.

97
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,139
Let the tank do the work,
so nobody gets hurt.

98
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,009
- Nobody gets hurt?

99
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,943
If they didn't want
anybody to get hurt,

100
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,678
we wouldn't be sitting in here.

101
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,613
- You know what I mean.

102
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,114
Better than you do, Dr. Jekyll.

103
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,218
(squelching)

104
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,656
Ugh, do we really need
two people for this test?

105
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,491
Can I be the only guinea pig?

106
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,628
- Dr. Albright is capable
of everything required.

107
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,163
- If she's so capable and
you're so confident about her,

108
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,432
why don't you let her
speak for herself?

109
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,835
- Colonel Nelson could
be right, doctor.

110
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,671
- I'm sure you're
both witty and wise.

111
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,073
All I need is your
professionalism.

112
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,175
This system is my life's work.

113
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,878
So, you'll excuse me
if I take it seriously.

114
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,751
- If we were any more
serious, we'd speak Latin.

115
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,353
Okay, so we do everything
by the book, huh?

116
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,522
(beeping)

117
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,358
Full auto test ready.

118
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,328
Hello?

119
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,363
Hello, anybody getting this?

120
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,197
- Yes.

121
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:30,403
We're ready here.

122
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,438
- Didn't seem like it.

123
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,509
Going with outboard
cameras, fore and aft.

124
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,345
Engaging drive.

125
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,347
- Wait, we haven't
opened the doors.

126
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,481
- Then you'd better.

127
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,484
(treads chattering)

128
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,098
Engaging pilot and
target interface.

129
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,267
Ugh!

130
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,606
(beeping)

131
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,975
- Colonel, are you
experiencing some discomfort?

132
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,276
(beeping)

133
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,744
- Ah, no discomfort,

134
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,113
but fucking head feels
like it's gonna come off.

135
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,615
- Language, please.

136
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,550
- Sorry, Doc, I
shouldn't have said head.

137
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,852
especially in the
company of a lady.

138
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,954
- Albright, what's going on?

139
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,788
Disconnect.

140
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,091
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

141
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,559
Not so fast.

142
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,128
It's uh, it's clearing now.

143
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,297
(beeping)

144
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,538
Uh, no pain, just a slight buzz.

145
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,318
Okay, okay now I can take it.

146
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,458
I'm uh, I'm turning
in each direction now.

147
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,939
Shouldn't the drone be
making an appearance here?

148
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,344
Hey, Albright,
what's the runtime?

149
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,147
Are we there yet?

150
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,081
- They're asking for it.

151
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,282
Should I send in the drone?

152
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,551
- No, release the decoy.

153
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,420
Let's see if the
inhibitor works.

154
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,055
- That's not what
they're expecting.

155
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,723
- That's just the point.

156
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,694
(engine roaring)

157
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,698
- Got it.

158
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,532
Firing, firing.

159
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,372
Ah, shit, it's a friendly.

160
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,341
Very funny, Doc.

161
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,911
- Let's see, how
would you put this?

162
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,648
There's nothing funny about
friendly fire, killing your own.

163
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,450
My system prevents this.

164
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,718
As a Gulf War veteran,

165
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,486
I thought you'd be
especially grateful.

166
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,554
- Yeah, I don't know
how they run the wars

167
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,388
without you, Doc.

168
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,692
- Hey, careful, you can't--
- What?

169
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,160
Oh, oh yeah.

170
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,662
Sort of itches like jock itch.

171
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,198
Sunburn, I meant to say.

172
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,200
- Any other symptoms?
- Ah, no.

173
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,071
Oh, maybe a slight ticking.
(soft ticking)

174
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,773
Maybe it's just my watch.

175
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,575
- What was that?

176
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,145
(engine roaring)

177
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,547
(bomb exploding)

178
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,283
(dramatic music)

179
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,557
- Damn, this power surge.

180
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,159
Shouldn't be happening.
- Yeah, war is hell.

181
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,194
Target identified as
enemy drone, firing.

182
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,065
(engine roaring)

183
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,334
(cannons firing)

184
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,170
(drone exploding)

185
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,042
Ah, man, this thing
is cooking me.

186
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,179
(squelching)

187
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:00,980
Ah.

188
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,885
Where were you when the
lights went out, Albright?

189
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,320
- [Albright] In
the fucking dark.

190
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,022
Base, do you copy?

191
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,191
- Yes, we're working on it.

192
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,294
What a mess.
- Mess, just a glitch.

193
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,797
Did you see the response
time on killing the drone,

194
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,799
even after being
distracted by the phony

195
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,966
only seconds before?

196
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,401
- Thunder, do you read me?

197
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,537
I show a failure in
the test link software.

198
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,908
- Okay, I'll disconnect.

199
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,716
We'll call you back
after I've rebooted.

200
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:38,784
- What's the problem?

201
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,322
(squelching)

202
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,560
I can't take this any more.

203
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,394
Oh.

204
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,099
Oh, uh.

205
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,349
- Colonel Nelson?
- Ugh, yeah, yeah.

206
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,086
Yeah, mother, I'm right here.

207
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,789
- How many fingers
am I holding up?

208
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,727
- 30, what's wrong
with our super tank?

209
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,496
- Nothing, it's a special
transmitter for the test data.

210
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,332
Drone must've hit it.

211
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,500
I just gotta get
out and reboot it.

212
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,368
- Well, let's go.

213
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,176
Look at 'em, will ya.

214
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,979
Feel like the only person
left in the world, doesn't it?

215
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,983
- Man, this thing is toasted.

216
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,719
Five dollar cable for a
$50 million prototype.

217
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,622
- What time ya got Albright?

218
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,193
I got 3:30 a.m.
- 3:30 a.m?

219
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,394
I guess that's right,

220
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,329
I don't know, I
don't have a watch.

221
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,431
- Dawn will be coming
in a couple of hours.

222
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,967
Seems like we've been
out here for days.

223
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:02,835
- What'd you say?

224
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,671
- We gotta be moving by dawn.

225
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,172
Come on and fix that thing.

226
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,407
- I'll disconnect it,
the tank doesn't need it.

227
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,476
Then we can head back.

228
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,810
- Head back, what the hell
are you talking about?

229
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,778
- Yeah, we'll head back.

230
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,313
They can put in a new unit,

231
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,215
and we can monitor
the rest of the test.

232
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,651
- We can't go back,
there is no back.

233
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,818
What was that?

234
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,289
We've been made, come on.

235
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,292
(suspenseful music)

236
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,131
- Ah, what are you--
- Shut up.

237
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,501
We have to get outta here.

238
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,902
We're going to stealth mode.

239
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,408
(beeping)

240
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,953
- Where'd it go?

241
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,756
- They're going full stealth,
no infrared reflection.

242
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,592
No electronic image capture
system can see her now.

243
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,262
- No shit, but they're not
supposed to do that now.

244
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,397
- Language, please.

245
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,433
Albright, Nelson, great work.

246
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,069
There's no trace of you at all.

247
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,903
Great going.

248
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,639
- Who's that?

249
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,809
They're not supposed
to be able to find us.

250
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,812
- Look, Colonel, I think
you're having hallucinations

251
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,047
brought on by the system,
I'm gonna disconnect you.

252
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,683
- No, can't operate this
tank without the interface.

253
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,851
What's the matter with you?

254
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,553
We'll be dead
behind enemy lines.

255
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,288
- It's just not combat,
everything's okay.

256
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,689
Just let me do what
has to be done.

257
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,524
- I'll beat you down,
I'm the ranking officer,

258
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,727
Captain Albright, if
that is your name.

259
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,729
(gun cocking)
- Ugh!

260
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,998
(groaning)

261
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,136
(squelching)

262
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,242
(beeping)

263
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,578
- There she is.

264
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,513
- Doctor, they're heading
into the minefield.

265
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,550
(tank rumbling)

266
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,825
(mine exploding)

267
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,828
(suspenseful music)

268
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,337
(mine exploding)

269
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,171
- Ugh!

270
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,674
Ugh!

271
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,780
- Does that sound like
a test to you, soldier?

272
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,349
- We're into the mine
perimeter, that's all.

273
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,183
- That's all?

274
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,318
Christ, look at them.

275
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,324
I'll just have to
dance my way through.

276
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,827
(alarm blaring)

277
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,496
(tank rumbling)

278
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,604
- Listen, Colonel,
let me apologize

279
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,807
for losing my head back there.

280
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,809
The stress just got to me.

281
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,143
I feel much better now.

282
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,246
- Yeah, well, if you say so.

283
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,916
Try that again, and
I'll have to take you.

284
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,785
I'll have to do whatever it
takes to fulfill our mission.

285
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:07,953
(beeping)

286
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,088
Shit, I'm gonna
drive right into one.

287
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,291
(mine exploding)

288
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,194
(tank rumbling)

289
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,096
Baby can sure take the abuse.

290
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,501
- What exactly is our mission,
Colonel, as you see it?

291
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,878
- Our mission is as simple
as it is unpleasant.

292
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,146
We've been left
behind enemy lines

293
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,380
to search out and destroy

294
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,649
all resistance and
communications.

295
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,619
- And, how long have we
been on this mission?

296
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,855
- I've always been
on this mission.

297
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,023
Vietnam, Panama,

298
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,893
the Gulf, and now this,

299
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,830
whatever this is.

300
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,400
That's what they pay me for.

301
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,635
I'm a killer, and I kill.

302
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,672
(suspenseful music)

303
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,716
- I don't know how to
tell you this, Colonel--

304
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,851
- Look, don't waste my
time by being polite, okay?

305
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,052
We're fighting for
our lives here.

306
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,954
- Well that's just
it, we're not!

307
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,657
We're on an experimental mission
about an hour out of L.A.

308
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,025
You've gotta believe me!

309
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,293
- I've seen this
before, Albright.

310
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,163
No offense, but you've
cracked under fire,

311
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,430
and I'm gonna have
to restrain you,

312
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,498
so that you don't get us killed.

313
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,767
(groaning)

314
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,671
(suspenseful music)

315
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,522
This machine can't think.

316
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,658
Can't know if she's
not a friendly anymore.

317
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,361
Mmm.

318
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,401
That's better.

319
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,237
(beeping)

320
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,071
So easy.

321
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,640
So easy.

322
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,215
(mine exploding)

323
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
(beeping)

324
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,886
(tank rumbling)

325
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,657
(suspenseful music)

326
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,130
(static buzzing)

327
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,434
(squelching)

328
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,838
(sighing)

329
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,876
(tank rumbling)

330
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,184
(suspenseful music)

331
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,266
- There's only one man that
can get us out of this.

332
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,248
(waves splashing)

333
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,102
(clearing throat) There he is.

334
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,816
(coughing)

335
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,251
- You all right, Cap?
- I'll be fine.

336
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,887
- You want a smoke?

337
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,356
- She's coughing
already, dipshit.

338
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,257
- But she's coughing because
she hasn't had a smoke.

339
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,592
- Cut it out, you guys.

340
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,428
- What is he doing?

341
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,263
- He's taking a swim,
what do you think?

342
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,132
- No, he's just standing there.

343
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:47,966
Look.

344
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,071
- He's terrified of the water.

345
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,840
- Ah, so, why is he in it?

346
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,342
- He's trying to beat his fear.

347
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,910
That's why I knew he'd be here.

348
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,280
Look, you guys stay
here, I'll go get him.

349
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:12,290
- The guy survived two wars,
afraid of the surf at Venice?

350
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,959
Does that make any sense to you?

351
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,427
- Of course it does.

352
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,163
- Sure, since you think
that inhaling hot toxic gas

353
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,465
from a cigarette will
stop you from coughing.

354
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,700
- Don't listen to me.

355
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,568
- I don't plan to.
- Let me finish.

356
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:27,706
It's dry, and windy,
and it's early.

357
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,541
Your own throat is probably
dry and scratchy right now.

358
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,375
Am I right?

359
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,779
- Yeah, I suppose it is.

360
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,516
- Well, have a cigarette,
and see how it feels.

361
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,128
(coughing)

362
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,663
- Hey you!

363
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,497
Mark Spitz!

364
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,966
- Hey, beautiful.

365
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,335
Where's Dr. Frankenstein?

366
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,271
- I left him back at the lab.

367
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,907
Brought Igor and
dark Theroux instead.

368
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,377
- What's up?

369
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,411
- It's not good.

370
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,814
- Be right there.

371
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,084
(waves splashing)

372
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,087
(suspenseful music)

373
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,338
I'm fine, let go.

374
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,313
- What the hell was that?

375
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,115
- Yeah, I mean, if he can't
swim, why'd he go in the water?

376
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,084
- He can swim.

377
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,086
- So, he's just a pussy.

378
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,691
- Robinson was the
first implant subject.

379
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,694
The implant triggered a
deep psychosis of water.

380
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,030
He's trying to beat
it so he can reenlist.

381
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,233
The Army's all he had, and
look what it did to him.

382
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,837
- Oh, she left a mark.

383
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,906
What, you've never
been slapped before?

384
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,042
Hey, look, some people
actually heighten

385
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,945
their sexual enjoyment with
a little physical contact.

386
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,050
(low beeps)

387
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,200
- I'm not gonna
lie to these men.

388
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,503
- Yes you are because it's
the only way to get this done.

389
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,838
- They're about to
risk their lives.

390
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,540
They deserve to know
the whole story.

391
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,775
- Everyone is a
volunteer in the program.

392
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,277
After they made that choice,

393
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,680
the rest of their duty is
to follow orders, my orders.

394
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,149
If we tell them they're going
out to kill a fellow soldier,

395
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,418
that'll prevent, or at
the very least hamper,

396
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,153
their ability to do just that.

397
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,288
- Kill?

398
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,356
You said we were
supposed to stop Nelson!

399
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,291
- We will.

400
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,492
Be careful, they'll hear us.

401
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,665
Now look, stop may mean kill.

402
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,234
I don't want another
San Diego incident here.

403
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,137
Iron Thunder is the only
irreplaceable element.

404
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,815
- Hey, Major Robinson,
who's our silent partner?

405
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,016
- Never seen him before.

406
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,019
- We'd better get acquainted.

407
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,422
Hey (whistles) you,
you want a smoke?

408
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,931
Would you have a light, then?

409
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,534
- If he doesn't smoke,
why would he have a light?

410
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,935
- Who says he doesn't smoke?

411
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,470
- He didn't say anything.

412
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,139
You just assume he wants
to die young, like you.

413
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,908
Let me handle this.

414
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:53,411
Hey, buddy, excuse my
ignorant friend here,

415
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,113
he's just trying to say hello.

416
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,514
I'm Theroux, this is Ashton.

417
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,753
You gonna tell us your name?

418
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:07,759
- Hey, look pal, we
have to work together.

419
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,060
We just thought it'd
be nice to be friendly,

420
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,261
but we don't have to be.

421
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,466
You know what?

422
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:16,901
Sorry, Major.

423
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,238
I just get edgy
when I don't smoke.

424
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,540
- You're not supposed to
smoke in here, anyway.

425
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,275
- I'm supposed to
be home in bed,

426
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,378
so the least they could
do is let me smoke.

427
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,179
- Yeah, at the risk
of agreeing with him,

428
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,515
I gotta ask you,
what's up Major?

429
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:32,717
- I don't know.

430
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,788
But it's not good, that
much I know for sure.

431
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,257
(approaching footsteps)

432
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,459
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

433
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,029
As you're about to learn,
we don't have much time.

434
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,264
Death Valley.

435
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,868
You've all been involved
in this project.

436
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,336
Two of you have been drivers.

437
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,072
After severe and
regrettable problems

438
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,307
adapting human
soldiers for my tank--

439
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,977
(ominous music)
(bubbling drowns out speaker)

440
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:03,915
(bubbling)
(waves crashing)

441
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,126
Well, not perfected, we
ran a test and, well,

442
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,595
the tank is running wild
through Death Valley.

443
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,531
Your mission is to stop it

444
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,067
before it reaches
Barstow or Las Vegas.

445
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,102
- At a top speed of
nearly 70 miles an hour,

446
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,805
it'll reach Barstow before we
have any hope of catching it.

447
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,941
- You're right, except he's on
a search and destroy pattern.

448
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:31,810
- He?

449
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,013
- It.

450
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,582
It's roving back and
forth to sweep the area.

451
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,118
Luckily, there's very
little to destroy,

452
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,820
but the pattern
will give us time.

453
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,490
- Excuse me, sir.

454
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,293
- Yes, go ahead.

455
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,661
- Destroy?

456
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,297
You mean that this
runaway is fully armed?

457
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,299
- The test was for
full combat, yes.

458
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,404
- I'm new around here, but
if I understand correctly,

459
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,875
this fully armed, unmanned
tank is completely invisible,

460
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,312
and it jams any form of
electronic surveillance,

461
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,947
satellite photos, video.

462
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,783
- Absolutely invisible,
except to the naked eye

463
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,120
and to magnified
optics like binoculars.

464
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,789
- Which also means that
computer-based targeting systems

465
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,791
can't lock in on it as a target.

466
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,259
- Naturally.

467
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,560
- And it's heading
into Las Vegas,

468
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,596
programmed to kill
everything in its path.

469
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,530
- Yes.

470
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,265
- And this is a bad thing?

471
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,200
I lost my whole fucking
Christmas savings there once.

472
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,869
- Something funny
about this, soldier?

473
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,103
- Nothing.

474
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,404
I'm just trying to get
a few laughs in up front

475
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,607
before we all go out
there and get killed.

476
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,609
- You know, he may
actually be right.

477
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,444
The beta prototype
that we'll be driving

478
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,379
is not target-invisible, is it?

479
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,117
- Age before beauty.

480
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,253
- You're both outta line.

481
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,454
Have a seat.

482
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,990
(ominous music)

483
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,491
That's an order.

484
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,460
I'm the ranking officer
here, this is my decision.

485
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,432
We volunteered
for this up front.

486
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,667
Can't just quit now.

487
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,302
Lives of innocent
people are at stake.

488
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,306
Since it's Vegas,
they aren't innocent,

489
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,408
but this is our mess, and you
both obviously know enough

490
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,510
that the only way
to stop this tank

491
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,945
is with the only one like it.

492
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,615
But stop it how?

493
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,385
- The tank you'll take will
be equally matched armor-wise.

494
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,520
You'll be able to
withstand her firepower,

495
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,788
and get in close enough

496
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:26,024
for a remote control
device to function.

497
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,292
That's why Hess is here.

498
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,471
It will override Thunder's
onboard controls.

499
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,941
Then you just get out and
shut the rest down manually.

500
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,642
- [Robinson] What's the
range on that thing?

501
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,477
- Sufficient.
- 100 feet.

502
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,615
Iron Thunder has its
electronic jamming gear on.

503
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,985
We can't expect the remote to
work any further than that.

504
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:54,819
- 100 feet?

505
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,455
We might as well get
out and spit on it

506
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,324
and short out the electronics.

507
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,693
- If that would work,
I'd do it myself.

508
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,262
- Really?

509
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,100
Step outside gentlemen,
I'll be right with you.

510
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,677
- Hey, I've been reading up on
the specs on those two tanks.

511
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,613
This might not be so bad.

512
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,781
Go out in the desert, blow
the shit outta something,

513
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,783
think of the bonus
pay we'll get.

514
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,719
- Yeah, and my dad
can buy a new car

515
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,220
with my life insurance policy.

516
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,358
What about you, Hess?

517
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,426
Think we'll make it?

518
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,831
I thought that's what you'd say.

519
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,233
Not up to us, anyhow.

520
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,436
We just do what they say.

521
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,139
- Well, yeah, so, we
might as well like it.

522
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,874
Right, Hess?

523
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,514
- We have a helicopter
at our command,

524
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,683
but we can't risk using it.

525
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,320
By the time it spotted Iron
Thunder, it'd be shot down.

526
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,757
- Iron Thunder's last known
position, three hours ago.

527
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,858
We just start looking.

528
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,794
- Permission to
speak freely, Doctor.

529
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,998
Look, this is a total
black bag project.

530
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,199
I know the life
you're most interested

531
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,935
in saving here is your own.

532
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,737
- I won't insult your
intelligence by denying that.

533
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,272
But, this is a chance
for you, as well.

534
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,573
- Well, sure, I know.

535
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,276
You had me booted
from your program

536
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,446
after your surgery screwed
me up, like it did Hess.

537
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,948
- How would you know about that?

538
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,817
- Just a guess, he doesn't
speak, my guess is he can't.

539
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:33,985
Not anymore.

540
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,486
- The surgery and
resulting blood clotting

541
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:36,988
led to his stroke.

542
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,456
He's aphasic.

543
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,124
- So, now you need us
poor, screwed up bastards

544
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,628
to stop your solution,
which is this robot runaway.

545
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,296
- I had to go with
a pilotless tank

546
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,098
rather than risk more surgery,

547
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,599
and more tragedies
like yours and--

548
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,600
- Save it!

549
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,202
I am not a tragedy.

550
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,274
I do this for you, I want my
record cleared and reinstated.

551
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,677
I have nothing outside the
Army, and I want back in.

552
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,679
You also promise me there'll
be no more surgeries,

553
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,981
or I go public with
this whole thing.

554
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,915
You understand?

555
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,552
- I agree to your terms.
- Of course you do.

556
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,586
So let's get it done.

557
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,223
(ominous music)

558
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,902
Don't worry.

559
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,404
What am I gonna be afraid
of, drowning in the desert?

560
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,376
(beeping)

561
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,479
(groaning)

562
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,785
(beeping)

563
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,188
It's these helmets
I really hate.

564
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,690
Why do they have to be airtight?

565
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,026
- It's the fiber optics,
they're sensitive to dust.

566
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,361
We changed all that
on Iron Thunder.

567
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,963
It's more like a visor.

568
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,832
- Changed all that then went
full automatic without pilots?

569
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,701
- Yeah, yeah that's right.

570
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,536
- Sounds like typical
government spending.

571
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,571
You know, they could
spend a little more

572
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,473
on the padding on these seats.

573
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,075
It's like sitting on a rock.

574
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,576
Ow!

575
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,811
And the headroom in here

576
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,680
is like my girlfriend's
Subaru in high school.

577
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,783
- You had a girlfriend
in high school?

578
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:12,583
- Yeah.

579
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,720
- Yeah, typical government BS.

580
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,196
(tank rumbling)

581
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,809
- Any request on
air conditioning?

582
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,744
- [Robinson] Yeah,
crank it all the way up.

583
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,814
- By all means, make
yourselves comfortable.

584
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:43,648
- [Robinson] Then
how about we all

585
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,116
go home and go to bed?

586
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,553
- I'll laugh and laugh at that
one once this is all over.

587
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,922
Now remember, radio silence.

588
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,425
Thunder will pick up your signal
and target you if you talk.

589
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,829
Absolute silence until you
locate and engage Thunder.

590
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,097
- [Robinson] That means you
won't be telling us what to do.

591
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,199
You know, I could
really get used to that.

592
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,602
That would be really
God damn fucking cool.

593
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,770
- Language.

594
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,175
- Guess that's one cost
you saved on Iron Thunder.

595
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,610
- What's that?

596
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,379
- Don't need air conditioning
if you don't need crew.

597
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,380
- Oh, yeah.

598
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,187
- Actually, their computer
gear is far more sensitive

599
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,723
than people.
- Give it a rest, Dr. Spock.

600
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,701
(tank rumbling)

601
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,211
- I haven't seen
any signs of life,

602
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,281
but I've had plenty
of time to think,

603
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,817
and I think I must be one
of the last ones left.

604
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,587
Seems like I've been
out here alone forever,

605
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,392
but, my watch ...

606
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,631
My watch says it isn't
even 10 hundred yet,

607
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,867
but what day?

608
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,177
Don't dare use the radio
or I'll be spotted,

609
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,547
but I've got to talk to
somebody or I'll go crazy.

610
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,151
So, I talk to myself.

611
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,994
Oh, this is the worse
fucking part for me, hmph.

612
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,931
Seems like they
don't even need me.

613
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,236
I'm the weak link.

614
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,508
Ah, not again.

615
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,248
(tank rumbling)

616
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,921
I gotta walk this off.

617
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,370
(suspenseful music)

618
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,633
(squelching)

619
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,480
(suspenseful music)

620
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,317
(rifles cocking)

621
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,652
- [Man] Hold it right there.

622
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:46,757
- I'm holding.

623
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,027
Can you tell me where I am?

624
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,996
- You are trespassing,

625
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,999
on the sovereign state of the
Unified Armies of the South.

626
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,834
- Never heard of that.

627
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,804
- You're wearing the
uniform of the oppressor.

628
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,073
You come onto our land, armed,

629
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,374
and you never heard of us.

630
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,713
And, we're supposed
to believe that?

631
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,415
- Sorry, I'm a bit confused.

632
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,251
I've been out here a long time.

633
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,155
I'm kinda glad you got me.

634
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,224
I'm tired of killing.

635
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,162
- So, you admit that
you're just an assassin.

636
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:25,963
- Absolutely.

637
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,168
- Go get the car
and a video camera.

638
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,373
This is great.

639
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,343
We finally got a fed to admit
what we've known all along.

640
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,714
Look, you're just the
kinda guy we can use.

641
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,917
- Use?
- Sure!

642
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,853
A convert is worth
a 1,000 believers.

643
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,390
My comrade is getting a camera

644
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,825
to record your testimonial.

645
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:07,905
Ha ha.

646
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,142
- Look, I'm surrendering
to you, okay?

647
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,611
And I expect the rights

648
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,679
the Geneva Convention
affords all POWs.

649
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,747
(laughing)

650
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,749
- Forget the Geneva Convention.

651
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,051
Man, you are more
hard core than most.

652
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,487
I want you to join us,
fight along with us.

653
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,790
- I'm tired of killing.

654
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,892
I'm surrendering to
you, I'm your prisoner.

655
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,126
(laughing)

656
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,828
- Don't be silly, we
don't take prisoners!

657
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,129
- You don't take prisoners?
- No!

658
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,998
- Then you leave me no choice.

659
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,001
(neck snaps)
- Ugh!

660
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,702
- [Nelson] Drop it!

661
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:42,006
(silenced gun firing)

662
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,775
(dramatic music)

663
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,214
- Come on, he's getting away.

664
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,515
Come on, he's getting away.

665
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:52,349
- No, you don't.

666
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,687
First we pray for the fallen.

667
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,658
Lord, accept our fallen brethren

668
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,093
into your bountiful
table of love.

669
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,729
Let their blood rain on
the parade of terror,

670
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,498
that will crush us
into human pulp.

671
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,973
- I don't take
prisoners, either.

672
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,976
(suspenseful music)

673
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,663
- Hey!

674
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,234
I told you so.
- Sure did.

675
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,137
- You guys blaspheming again?

676
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,939
- No, ma'am.
- There he is!

677
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:52,142
(guns firing)

678
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,879
(dramatic music)

679
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,381
Get on the horn and warn 'em.

680
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,420
- Hey, we got another Waco.

681
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,922
They killed Matthew and Luke,

682
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,290
and that tank's
heading right for you

683
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,725
with death ring hot and heavy.

684
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,827
- Waco, good God.
- I'm gonna find the nest.

685
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,395
- [Radio] What the heck
are you talking about now?

686
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,964
I'll bet not a week,
not a day goes by,

687
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,199
not a minute goes by,

688
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,636
and you're gonna start
talking about Waco.

689
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,413
- Tried to surrender,
and now God help you.

690
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,016
(cannon firing)

691
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,752
(loud explosion)

692
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,628
(beeping)

693
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,197
(laughs)

694
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,867
(tank rumbling)

695
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,975
- Buy you a beer?

696
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,078
- Okay.

697
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,714
- If you weren't dogs,
I'd whip you silly.

698
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,383
(tank rumbling)

699
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,488
- Well, that's the road.

700
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,157
Let's see where it leads.

701
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:17,161
(tank rumbling)

702
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,568
(suspenseful music)

703
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,241
- Where are we going?

704
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,377
- Lonespear, population 75.

705
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,347
- That's nowhere near Iron
Thunder's last position.

706
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,581
- Doesn't matter
where it's been.

707
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,083
The trick is to find
where it's going.

708
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,317
On a search and destroy path,

709
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,653
that's the first
thing it'll find.

710
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,487
- Clever.

711
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,724
- We just have to hope
we get there first.

712
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,496
(loud explosion)

713
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,475
- Only eight minutes.

714
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,112
I'll be miles from here

715
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,680
before they come to
count the bodies.

716
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,617
(alarm blaring)

717
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,520
Oh, bonus, an actual
tactical target,

718
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:24,294
or the closest thing
this place has to offer.

719
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,501
(shell exploding)

720
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,771
So easy, ha ha ha.

721
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,608
They make it so easy to kill,
you almost don't notice.

722
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,978
(beeping)

723
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,749
I wonder how much harder
they make it to die.

724
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,719
(suspenseful music)

725
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,853
How much could it take?

726
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:16,747
How much can I take?

727
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,453
(tank rumbling)

728
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,198
- Lonespear, population zero.

729
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,601
- Perhaps you'd
like the binoculars,

730
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,002
so you can count
the dead bodies?

731
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,104
Be a little funnier.

732
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,174
(fire crackling)

733
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,014
- I grew up in a place with
a population of about 100.

734
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,284
- No sign, should
I call this in?

735
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,652
- We can't.

736
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:56,987
Thunder's monitoring
our channels

737
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,322
and will know we're coming.

738
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,559
- What is it?

739
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,728
- Like you expect him to answer.

740
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:07,464
- Hey, I'm used to people
that talk too much, like you.

741
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:11,201
(tank rumbling)

742
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,847
(suspenseful music)

743
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,651
- I see it!

744
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,686
There he goes, a cold
object moving in a hot fire.

745
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:30,921
Ashton!
- Yes, sir?

746
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,122
- Get up topside.

747
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,390
If Thunder moves
out of the fire,

748
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,758
she'll be invisible
to us down here.

749
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,660
The best eyes for
this will be up top.

750
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,363
- Hey, don't forget your helmet.

751
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,964
You'll need protection up there.

752
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,469
(dramatic music)

753
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,320
(beeping)

754
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:05,856
There's no motion now.

755
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,925
Maybe the shadow on the
fire was some other object.

756
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,493
Ashton, anything?

757
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,461
- No sign.

758
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,132
(gun firing)

759
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,438
What are you doing?

760
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,706
We can't see the
target, you're our eyes!

761
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:23,974
- I beg your pardon, sir,

762
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:24,942
but I can't see if
I'm dead up there.

763
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,777
Her guns are pelting us.

764
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:31,181
(cannon firing and
shells exploding)

765
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,031
- Hess, get the remote
on, she's plenty close.

766
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,236
(tanks rumbling)

767
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:57,241
Hold on!
(cannon firing)

768
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:59,343
- Oh.

769
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:03,213
- Theroux, we gotta
do this by hand, fire!

770
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,550
- Where?
- Right in front of us.

771
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,954
(cannon firing and
shells exploding)

772
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:27,938
Hess, what's going
on with the remote?

773
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,742
Can you fix it?

774
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,144
Do it, and fast!

775
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:43,086
(cannon firing and
shells exploding)

776
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,056
- You can't even scratch it.

777
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,391
- If you hit somebody
and they don't go down,

778
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,825
you hit 'em again.

779
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:53,830
Fire again, down five degrees.

780
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,100
(cannon firing and
shell exploding)

781
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,303
- Finally, some resistance.

782
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,304
Tough bastards, too.

783
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,573
I'll just have to
knock their feet out.

784
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,678
(cannon firing and
shell exploding)

785
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:12,149
- I think someone's
throwing rocks at us.

786
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,383
- It's going for our treads.

787
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,985
It knows it can't
penetrate our armor.

788
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,522
Pretty smart machine Doc
Walker has against us.

789
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,556
Right, Dr. Albright?

790
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,392
Little too smart, maybe?

791
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,563
(shell exploding)

792
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:31,501
- You saying we've had it?
- I never say that.

793
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,504
(suspenseful music)

794
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,309
(shell exploding)

795
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,481
- I can't see through
all this smoke.

796
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,782
(beeping)

797
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:48,318
- It's not as bad as
it seems, it's worse.

798
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,887
How you coming with that, Hess?

799
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,825
(shell exploding)

800
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,126
That better mean two seconds,

801
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,761
or it'd be just too bad for us.

802
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:05,268
- [Theroux] Still
can't see anything.

803
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,039
(shell exploding)

804
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,542
- Try to outrun her, maybe
she's slower than us.

805
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,685
- Don't you dare run from me.

806
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,354
(tank rumbling)

807
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,956
- Oh, man, I think
I'm gonna puke.

808
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:01,391
I can't ride
backwards like this.

809
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,326
- We have to keep the
front facing the enemy.

810
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,695
That's the thickest armor.
- Exactly, Theroux.

811
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,732
Keep firing whenever
you get a chance.

812
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,204
(cannon firing and
shell exploding)

813
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,443
It can outrun running Thunder.

814
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,180
- Oh, that felt great!

815
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,115
Oh yeah, much farther
away than before.

816
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,516
Yeah, we're as good as home.

817
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,520
(tank rumbling)

818
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,923
- I think I'll knock and
see if anybody's home.

819
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,895
(tanks banging)

820
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,134
- Can't get a clear shot.

821
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,036
He'll finish us off at will.

822
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,104
- Well then, why doesn't he?

823
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:47,938
- He will,

824
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,075
when he's sure we're
all good and terrified.

825
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,656
- Enough fun.

826
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,825
(beeping)

827
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,138
God damn machine!

828
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,807
(alarm blaring)

829
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:29,813
What the?

830
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,117
- Nice job.

831
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:35,719
What else can you
do with that thing?

832
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,826
(tanks rumbling)

833
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,633
- Okay, I'll just go manual.

834
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,936
(beeping)

835
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:00,977
God damn it!

836
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,480
Oh, Jesus.

837
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,916
God damn me!

838
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,218
Ugh!

839
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,723
Ugh, but not yet.

840
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:15,959
Ah.

841
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,897
(tank rumbling)

842
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,844
- Ready to fire on command.
- So, finish them off.

843
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,746
- Hey, that's not our mission.

844
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,815
- That fucking thing
tried to kill us.

845
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,717
- Excellent battle
assessment, soldier.

846
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:44,688
We pulled its teeth,
and we put on a leash.

847
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,989
That's your job, Albright.

848
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,092
- What?

849
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,026
- What's the problem?

850
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,428
The machine is shut down.

851
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,796
Now, go over there and get in.

852
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,165
Let's get back to Dr.
Frankenstein in time for dinner.

853
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,033
- Yeah, right, sorry.

854
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,436
- What's wrong?

855
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,604
Thunder is harmless
now, isn't it?

856
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:06,009
- Yeah, Hess, you and I'll go.

857
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,045
- Sir, I'd like to grab a
quick smoke, if that's okay.

858
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,514
- No, too dangerous.
- But I thought that--

859
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:14,017
- Call the base, report
what has happened.

860
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,418
We'll just sit here and watch.

861
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,087
I don't think we've been
given the whole story

862
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,622
on our unmanned rogue tank.

863
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,162
(suspenseful music)

864
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,186
- Look, I'm supposed to do this,

865
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,721
but I'm not a good enough shot.

866
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,093
Alright, I'm a
perfectly good shot,

867
00:54:57,093 --> 00:55:00,697
but I can't look Nelson
in the face and shoot him.

868
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,198
I'll hesitate,

869
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,601
and he'll have enough time
to kill the both of us.

870
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,221
- Theroux, watch sharp.

871
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,823
Keep your finger on the trigger.

872
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,293
- What am I watching for?

873
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,799
(dramatic music)

874
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,830
(gun firing)

875
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,268
- There he is!

876
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,470
- No, he's hiding
behind the tank.

877
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,571
- I'll take us around.

878
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,141
(tank rumbling)

879
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,178
- I've got him, firing.

880
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:25,081
(gun firing)

881
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:28,084
(suspenseful music)

882
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,705
That's it, gentlemen,
it's toe-to-toe time.

883
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,340
Grab your guns,
and go after him.

884
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,174
- Yes, sir.

885
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:55,979
- Yes, sir.

886
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,087
(gun firing)

887
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,321
- What are you shooting at?

888
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,890
- Anything that can shoot back.

889
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,929
(gun firing)

890
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,169
- Why did you block our fire?

891
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,603
We had Nelson in our sights.

892
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,872
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Save it.

893
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,974
- Hey, I didn't think
anybody else had to die.

894
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,376
- Nelson wiped out a whole town!

895
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,478
It's too late to think
about saving lives!

896
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,981
(guns firing)

897
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:54,971
All right.

898
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,973
Let's get inside and get
this monster outta here.

899
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,679
(guns firing)

900
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:11,554
Clear!

901
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,565
Must've had a spare
airtight helmet like mine on

902
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,267
when he ran.
- Yeah.

903
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,503
(coughing)

904
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,323
- Figures!

905
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:48,992
Take the carburetor and this
thing is just a boat anchor.

906
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:54,898
(engine grinding to a stop)

907
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,835
(beeping)

908
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,941
- There you are,
where have you been?

909
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,744
- Just let him rant for a few
moments out of politeness.

910
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,915
Yes, base, we're calling
from Iron Thunder,

911
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,416
it is in our control.

912
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:14,450
- I see you.

913
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,919
You have to get to cover.

914
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,353
That town that was destroyed

915
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,055
is drawing a lot of
unwanted media attention.

916
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,623
- Yes, when towns are destroyed,

917
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:21,925
the media usually follows.

918
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,028
- You have to take cover,
let the helicopters clear.

919
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,297
- Aren't you even
gonna ask about Nelson?

920
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,533
- Um ...

921
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,635
- Uh-huh, you sent us
out here to murder a man,

922
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,103
and didn't even let us know.

923
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,272
Well, we almost lost your
charming assistant, Albright,

924
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,041
and your previous
casualty, Hess.

925
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,275
Would you have gone out there

926
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:40,643
knowing you might
have to kill Nelson?

927
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,879
- Ha, fuck no, I like Nelson.

928
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:44,414
Thought he was old
and smart enough

929
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,583
not to let you touch him with
your electrodes and scalpels.

930
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,618
- Language, please.

931
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,588
Now, I'm sorry that
Nelson is dead, but if--

932
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,623
- Dead, who said he's dead?

933
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,558
(gun firing)

934
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:58,328
(dramatic music)

935
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,435
(guns firing)

936
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,139
- Okay, he's hiding
behind the last house.

937
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,375
I'll go left, you go right.

938
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,710
- No, no, we shouldn't,
it's a bad idea.

939
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,380
- How's this for an idea?

940
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,581
How about I capture Nelson

941
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,049
and we go the media
and expose you

942
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,518
and this whole
vivisection program?

943
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:57,920
- Do you think I like using
people in this program?

944
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,289
Especially ingrates
like yourself?

945
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,426
The weakness in my work

946
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,595
is that it must
still use people.

947
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:06,929
They are the weak link.

948
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,568
If I could copy
the human machine,

949
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,504
ape the human brain
in microchip form,

950
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,106
so that I'd never have to rely
on the likes of you again,

951
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,510
I'd be satisfied.
(guns firing)

952
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,547
(dramatic music)

953
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,210
(gun firing)

954
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,556
I have feelings, too.

955
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:43,526
I'm trying to remove people
from the dangers of war.

956
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,027
- Remove people from war?

957
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:47,964
You think the machines are
only gonna kill each other?

958
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,932
Hey, look, we have
a deal, you and I,

959
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,667
and I already know that you
lied to get me out here,

960
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,503
so why should I stick to
my half of the bargain?

961
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:57,507
- If you expose this program,
you'll never get reinstated.

962
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:59,809
You'll just go off and ...

963
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,377
- Come on, we got
a tank to hide.

964
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:08,251
- See anything?

965
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,053
- You got a smoke?

966
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,890
(heavy breathing)

967
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,245
- Jesus, man, you look
like you just got laid.

968
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,815
- I got to admit,
this is a rush.

969
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,018
- Getting killed is a rush?

970
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,319
You didn't even want
to come out here.

971
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,254
- We're not killed.

972
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,490
And, yeah, it's just like
playing army as a kid, only--

973
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,358
- Only, only after
you die out here,

974
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,060
you don't get to home
and get cookies from mom

975
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,528
before you go to bed.

976
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:56,032
Come on, let's get that bastard,
and get the fuck outta here

977
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,387
- Hess, wait, wait a minute!

978
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,389
Damn thing's stuck in drive.

979
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,991
There, go again.

980
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,660
(tank rumbling)

981
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,533
Guess I should check
with Frick and Frack.

982
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,706
Theroux, Ashton, you there?

983
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,009
- Yeah, we're here.

984
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,277
You fucking gave
our position away.

985
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,945
- Do you have him yet?
- No, but he's close.

986
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:46,015
There's a whole fricking
maze of old junk out here.

987
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,417
It's an old junkyard.
- Junk in a junkyard.

988
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,352
Tell me something I don't know,

989
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,419
like when you'll have him.

990
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:51,921
- I don't know, we're looking.

991
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:54,790
- Get him alive, if you can.

992
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,092
- [Ashton] That's
a real nice idea,

993
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,027
but this guy is
shooting to kill.

994
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,295
- [Theroux] Yeah, if
you want him alive,

995
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,197
you better call us back
and bring in the troops.

996
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,632
If we see him, it's him or us.

997
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,600
- No, you stay there and
get him dead or alive.

998
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,968
We're hiding these
tanks and laying low

999
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,204
until further notice
from Dr. Octopus.

1000
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,438
Check in every 15.

1001
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:12,074
We'll relieve you if
we're here past dusk.

1002
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,376
- Where are we gonna hide?

1003
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,546
(tank rumbling)

1004
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:03,259
- It's off the beaten
track enough, right Hess?

1005
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,027
- You know, he can't
answer, why ask?

1006
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,529
- Let's see, I know
he can't speak,

1007
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:09,932
just like I knew that we were
following an unmanned tank.

1008
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,367
Just checking, you might say.

1009
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:18,874
(suspenseful music)

1010
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,475
Okay, town's secure.

1011
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:53,776
Let's get out of the heat.

1012
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,480
Sorry, Hess, somebody
has stay with the tanks.

1013
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:02,151
- We can see the tanks
just fine from here.

1014
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:06,355
- Sure can, but I don't trust
him, or anyone right now.

1015
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,970
- Man, I need a smoke.

1016
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,538
- So, have one.

1017
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,973
- My hands shake too much.

1018
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:25,908
- Here.

1019
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,502
- I wanna talk to
you about something.

1020
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,271
- This isn't a good
time, it'll have to wait.

1021
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,806
- It's already waited too long.

1022
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,574
- So, leave it alone.

1023
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,576
- That wouldn't be
fair to either of us.

1024
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,845
- Everything is fair
in love and war.

1025
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,780
Cliche equals brutal reality.

1026
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,816
I'm the poster boy for it.

1027
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,350
- I know you hate Walker.

1028
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,219
- Hate is too short
a word for it.

1029
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:14,090
- And I went along with him in
not telling you about Nelson.

1030
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,558
- Oh, that I can forgive,

1031
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,860
but what I can't change is
the fact that my life is over,

1032
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,962
and you held the
scalpel that killed it.

1033
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,764
- We planned it together.

1034
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,666
It was a quick
promotion for you,

1035
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:26,869
and a raise and a happily
ever after for the both of us.

1036
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,607
The night before, we got drunk
and you raised a toast to,

1037
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:35,811
what was it, a
shortcut to our dreams.

1038
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,947
(laughing)

1039
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,148
- I'd forgotten that.

1040
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,383
What was that again,
shortcut to our dreams?

1041
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,021
Now all I have is fear and
it's only getting worse.

1042
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,024
At first I thought,

1043
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,326
well there goes my
career as a lifeguard.

1044
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,129
Then I couldn't
sleep when it rained.

1045
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:58,868
And, I found myself
watching the water

1046
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,402
spiral down the
drain in the shower

1047
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,770
and felt like I was falling.

1048
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,308
Doesn't make any sense,
but I can't make it stop.

1049
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:08,878
And that's the
way it is with us.

1050
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,015
I'm sorry to say, but
when I look at you,

1051
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:16,018
I see you with that knife
in your hand doing it.

1052
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,220
- I held the knife, but
it was your love and faith

1053
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,556
that gave me the
strength to use it.

1054
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,658
- Jesus, don't say that.

1055
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,827
- It hurts, but it's the truth.

1056
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,029
It's the only truth in
this whole nightmare.

1057
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,365
You don't want back in.

1058
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:30,866
Let me get out.

1059
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,169
Then we can build a life
together without the Army.

1060
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:37,406
- I could have at
first, but I can't now.

1061
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:40,409
Walker owes it to me.

1062
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,610
I want something out of this,

1063
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,512
because everything
else I wanted is gone.

1064
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,552
There's nothing left of us
that I'll ever have now.

1065
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:55,424
- The night we got drunk, we
got too drunk to fool around.

1066
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,195
- No, it's too late.

1067
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,297
- You can still have me.

1068
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,933
It's one thing, it's
a place to start.

1069
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,134
- We can't, not here.

1070
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,436
- You always were the shy,

1071
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:09,872
shy one.

1072
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,075
- There's not enough time.

1073
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,511
- Relax, we've
already got the tank.

1074
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:16,879
They'll get Nelson.

1075
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,160
(dramatic music)

1076
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,680
(gun firing)

1077
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,823
(romantic music)

1078
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,965
- The smell of these
make you easy to find.

1079
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,801
(heavy breathing)

1080
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:50,139
And these vests make
you harder to kill.

1081
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,574
(gun firing)

1082
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,156
(waves crashing)

1083
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,611
(gun firing)

1084
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,213
- Help!

1085
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,114
Help!

1086
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,516
(gun firing)

1087
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:42,491
- Ashton is hit, I'm
pinned down, need help.

1088
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,159
Repeat.

1089
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,528
- Don't repeat, stay
there, we're on our way.

1090
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,063
Keep firing so we can find you.

1091
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,901
(glass breaking)

1092
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,472
(gun firing)

1093
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,777
(suspenseful music)

1094
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:22,331
(guns firing)

1095
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,035
The shots are either
coming from that trailer

1096
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,103
or behind that junk.

1097
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,605
- I gotta get to Ashton.

1098
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:32,241
- Absolutely, let's
lay down cover fire.

1099
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,743
(guns firing)

1100
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,516
Hess, you check out
that spot to the right.

1101
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:41,316
I'm going left.

1102
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:51,360
- We're here now.

1103
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,828
You're gonna be alright.

1104
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,129
- No, I'm not.

1105
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,164
- How do you know?

1106
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,166
You're not the doctor here.

1107
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,401
- I've been hurt in the past,

1108
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,236
pretty bad, too, a couple times,

1109
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:03,405
but never this bad.

1110
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:06,375
- Look, look, you're always
wrong about everything,

1111
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,076
haven't you figured
that out by now?

1112
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,945
- No, I'm the one who's right.

1113
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:12,247
- Don't argue with me,
you're gonna make it!

1114
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,954
- Smoke.

1115
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,489
Smoke.

1116
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:23,859
- Yeah.
- No, no, Nelson.

1117
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,428
Nelson's got one of my smokes.

1118
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:29,998
You could find him by the smell.

1119
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,712
- Nelson, I know you're in here.

1120
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,482
I sent the others
away so we can talk.

1121
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:51,553
- Robinson, what the
hell are you doing here?

1122
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:54,122
- I know you're in here,
I can smell the cigarette.

1123
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,358
They say you're crazy, man,

1124
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,260
but you know you can trust me.

1125
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,795
Talk to me.

1126
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,231
- How'd you get this far
behind enemy lines, Robinson?

1127
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:05,467
- I'm in the other tank.
- The other?

1128
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:06,835
You mean in the enemy tank?

1129
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:11,206
You went over to the other
side, man, I can't believe it.

1130
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:12,641
After everything I taught you.

1131
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:15,043
- No, wait, it was Dr.
Walker that did this to you.

1132
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:16,144
And, Albright, too.

1133
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:19,147
- Albright,

1134
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:21,984
I killed her in the minefield.

1135
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:23,886
- Sure, sure whatever you say.

1136
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:26,355
Look, they'll probably
be back here soon.

1137
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,024
We can make 'em both pay
for what they did to us.

1138
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,659
You just have to
come in with me.

1139
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,395
Just you and me.

1140
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:34,796
The others aren't important.

1141
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,032
Trust me, man.

1142
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,468
Neither of us has any choice.

1143
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,043
(suspenseful music)

1144
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,789
(rifle cocking)

1145
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:01,723
(sighs)

1146
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,125
Ah, Hess, have you seen Nelson?

1147
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,996
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

1148
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,133
What did you hear, everything?

1149
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:13,569
Look, it was all just bull,

1150
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:14,536
you know, to get him to come in

1151
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:15,737
or come out in the open.

1152
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:18,774
What are you gonna do?

1153
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,108
Shoot me and explain later?

1154
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:24,680
My grandmother had a stroke.

1155
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,847
She couldn't speak like you,

1156
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,583
but she couldn't
really write, either,

1157
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:28,784
just like you, I'll bet.

1158
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,121
Look, soldier, you
gotta tow the line,

1159
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,189
because you don't
have any choice,

1160
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:35,724
now get back to the tanks.

1161
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:39,928
That's an order.

1162
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:44,666
(suspenseful music)

1163
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:13,962
- Here he comes.

1164
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,004
- How is he?

1165
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,540
Nelson is still
around here somewhere.

1166
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,441
We gotta find him.

1167
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:30,278
Come on, soldier.

1168
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,717
- I'm gonna finish
my cigarette first.

1169
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:39,588
(somber music)

1170
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:30,272
- Wait a minute, what's that?

1171
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:31,707
- I don't hear anything.

1172
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,376
(tank rumbling)

1173
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:37,979
- Damn it, Hess!

1174
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,056
- Oh man, he's been
hit pretty hard.

1175
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,958
- He's lucky to be alive.

1176
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,393
I don't have time
to care right now.

1177
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,328
We gotta keep Nelson in sight.

1178
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:54,663
- Why didn't he kill Hess?

1179
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,965
- Maybe he thought he did.
- I got away.

1180
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:58,333
- There's a reason for this.

1181
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,968
- Look, Theroux, I'm
sorry Ashton is dead,

1182
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,170
but that's the way it is
in war, even a little one.

1183
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,373
Most die, some live,
there is no reason

1184
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,242
If you can't accept that,
then deal with it later.

1185
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,477
You see that?

1186
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:11,146
(tank rumbling)

1187
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:13,682
No time.

1188
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,418
(dramatic music)

1189
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,957
(tank rumbling)

1190
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:30,365
- What is it?
- Air conditioning's out.

1191
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,701
- It's tough, ain't it.

1192
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:48,016
(tanks rumbling)
(dramatic music)

1193
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,305
She's a sitting duck,
blow the treads off!

1194
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,375
- Something's wrong.
- What the hell

1195
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:14,543
are you talking about?

1196
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:15,577
The bastard killed your friend.

1197
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,879
Kill him!
- No, this is too easy.

1198
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,286
- I'm taking back firing
control, and fire without you.

1199
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:27,923
- No, stop!

1200
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:30,759
Stop!

1201
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:33,361
Stop, this thing's
wired to blow.

1202
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:40,135
(tank rumbling)

1203
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:44,506
- That amazing bastard.

1204
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:47,843
Can't penetrate our armor,
except from the inside.

1205
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:50,345
Left you alive, Hess,

1206
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:51,613
so that we'd all get
in the tank together,

1207
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,148
and then he'd get
us all at once.

1208
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,189
(dramatic music)

1209
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:08,230
- You gotta stop, I
can't hold this thing.

1210
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:13,668
Trace that wire,
see where it goes.

1211
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,273
- I'm coming back there.
- No, don't!

1212
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:21,509
The wire leads into
the targeting system

1213
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,644
that you're wired into.

1214
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,481
(clanking)

1215
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:30,919
- Okay, let's all keep cool.

1216
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:32,487
Nelson didn't have
more than 20 minutes

1217
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:35,056
to rig this thing, so it can't
be incredibly complicated.

1218
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,291
- If we shut off anything,

1219
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,959
it could cut the
power in the wire.

1220
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,228
- That might be all it'll
take to keep it from blowing.

1221
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:43,832
- [Theroux] Yeah, or that could
be exactly what'll blow it.

1222
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:44,833
- Absolutely right.

1223
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:48,003
- Careful, don't
break the leads!

1224
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:51,072
(beeping)

1225
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:52,774
- Okay, we can't cut the wire.

1226
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,477
We gotta figure if we cut
the current, it blows.

1227
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:58,546
The shell is the bomb,
so we take it out,

1228
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:01,750
open it up, empty out all
the explosive material,

1229
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,051
without triggering it.

1230
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:05,420
- It's gonna be
almost impossible.

1231
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,755
If we slide the shell out

1232
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,257
and accidentally
disconnect the wire, we go.

1233
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:13,194
- The only easy way out
of this is to let it blow,

1234
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:14,462
and kill us all.

1235
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:16,631
I'd rather do a little
work and try to live.

1236
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:18,867
- I'm ready.

1237
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,402
- No, I'm stuck in
here, I'll do it.

1238
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,304
- Somebody's gotta hold the
shell while it's pried open.

1239
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:23,738
- Absolutely, but we
need space to work,

1240
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:25,607
and there's no sense
in us all dying.

1241
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:26,508
Albright?

1242
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:27,776
- I'm not leaving.

1243
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,110
- You've got that right,
sister, you're a surgeon

1244
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,946
and this is like
doing brain surgery.

1245
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,180
- But, she's a woman.

1246
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:34,482
- I'll take that as
a compliment, now go.

1247
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:35,750
- Has to be that way.

1248
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,719
Hess suffered a head
wound and you're ...

1249
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:41,256
Well, let's just say
you're too young to die.

1250
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:47,429
- Nelson's gotta be
out there somewhere,

1251
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:48,663
waiting for the big boom

1252
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:50,732
before he comes back
to finish us off.

1253
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:55,904
Yeah, you're right.

1254
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:57,305
We're screwed either way.

1255
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,809
- Okay, I'll hold it steady,
you get the head off.

1256
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,615
We get that off,
we've saved the tank.

1257
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:09,351
Explosives inside
will turn us to jelly,

1258
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,586
but Dr. Walker's
tank will make it.

1259
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:12,854
- Oh, great.

1260
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:17,859
(metal squeaking)
(suspenseful music)

1261
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:28,036
Careful.

1262
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:51,659
You got it.

1263
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:56,031
Now, pull.

1264
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:03,671
Careful.

1265
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,609
- I can't see the
end of the wire.

1266
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:08,877
- Figures.

1267
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:09,878
It's clear down at
the blasting cap.

1268
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:10,812
Just start emptying the shell

1269
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,080
till we get to the bottom.

1270
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:47,048
- Okay, you wanna
make me feel better?

1271
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:52,120
After I've removed
this gunpowder,

1272
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,822
how dangerous is
the blasting cap?

1273
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,958
- Not too bad.

1274
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,426
Enough to blow your face off.

1275
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:01,463
Careful, no laughing.

1276
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,867
(suspenseful music)

1277
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:12,974
- What is going on?

1278
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:17,145
- Shut up, we're busy!

1279
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,413
- Busy doing what?

1280
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:20,148
You've been out of
contact for hours.

1281
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:22,784
We have your position,

1282
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,252
and you're out in
the open again.

1283
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:25,587
What are you thinking?

1284
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,057
Talk to me.

1285
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:29,891
Come on, talk to me.

1286
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:31,559
Where is Iron Thunder?

1287
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:34,529
- Shut that thing, off!
- Talk to me, Albright.

1288
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:35,663
- I can't.

1289
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:36,464
We'll cut the current.
- Talk to me.

1290
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:37,465
Come on, talk to me.

1291
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,933
- Right.
- Where is Iron Thunder?

1292
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:42,737
Talk to me, Albright, Robinson,
what is going on out there?

1293
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:43,771
- You hold the shell.

1294
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,278
I'm gonna reach in, and
you push on the outside.

1295
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:53,181
We've gotta unscrew the shell
casing to expose the cap.

1296
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:55,316
- But the wire runs in--
- Through the bottom,

1297
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:58,186
and every twist we make
is gonna pull on it.

1298
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:00,655
You've got to keep
it from coming loose.

1299
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,668
- This is serious, Robinson.

1300
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:16,371
This is your life we're
talking about, not just a job.

1301
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:20,808
And, you, too, Albright.

1302
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,545
I'll blame you for this
whole program's failures.

1303
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,547
You're the one with
blood on your hands.

1304
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:30,818
- Watch what you're doing.

1305
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:32,654
Don't let that
fucker distract you.

1306
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:33,655
- I heard that.

1307
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:35,156
Language, please.

1308
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:37,225
- Shut up, you motherfucker!

1309
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:38,493
(bomb exploding)

1310
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,028
- What was that?
- I don't know.

1311
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,863
- Are they still on the scope?

1312
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:44,432
- Yeah, but we lost the radio
and their homing signal.

1313
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,837
(coughing)
(banging)

1314
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:53,408
- I'm fine.

1315
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:55,677
(groaning)

1316
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:00,782
Get this off.

1317
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:03,051
(groaning)

1318
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:05,353
- It won't budge.

1319
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:08,489
- I can feel a pulse.

1320
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:11,759
- I'm all right.

1321
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:12,994
I'm just dizzy.

1322
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:13,928
It's really hot in here.

1323
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:15,063
Get this thing off of me.

1324
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:18,399
Sweating like crazy.

1325
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:32,313
- It looks worse than it is.

1326
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:35,149
Head wounds just
bleed like crazy.

1327
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,651
Just gotta get this thing off.

1328
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:39,654
- It's jammed.

1329
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:42,390
- I'll do it!

1330
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,394
Ah!

1331
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,163
- [Theroux] No.

1332
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:51,065
- Gotta get outta here!

1333
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:53,668
Ah!

1334
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:58,606
(grunting)

1335
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:07,181
(water bubbling)

1336
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:13,221
(dramatic music)
(groaning)

1337
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:53,094
(water bubbling)

1338
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,106
(waves crashing)

1339
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,915
(dramatic music)

1340
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:42,777
- Come on, Albright.

1341
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:44,412
- What's the use?

1342
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:45,880
- We're alive.

1343
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,116
Look, it's like Robinson
told me when Ashton ate it.

1344
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:50,985
He's dead, we're alive,
you can cry about it later.

1345
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,388
- No, I mean what's the use?

1346
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,290
We can't beat him,
we're equally matched.

1347
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:59,594
- We don't have a choice,
he doesn't take prisoners.

1348
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,265
Yeah, you're right,

1349
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,100
we can build one of
these like Nelson did.

1350
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,237
- Yeah, but we can't sneak
into his tank like we did ours.

1351
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,738
- We don't have to.

1352
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:13,508
Look, during World War II,
the only way the Germans

1353
01:30:13,508 --> 01:30:15,443
had to defeat the
new Russian tanks

1354
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:16,878
was to sneak in close enough

1355
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:19,680
to stick a land mine
under the turret's armor.

1356
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,316
- Anybody ever tell
you, you read too much?

1357
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:23,951
- Read?

1358
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:25,686
I got it off the internet.

1359
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:26,921
(scoffs)

1360
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:29,824
Now, look, he'll stop
to finish us off, okay.

1361
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:32,260
We play dead, I
sneak up close enough

1362
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,328
to stick one of these
under the turret.

1363
01:30:34,328 --> 01:30:35,863
- There's no time!

1364
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:38,132
We can't rig it as a bomb,
he'll be here in minutes.

1365
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:39,667
- We don't have to.

1366
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,836
I get it in there, and then I
hit it with small arms fire.

1367
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,308
(tank rumbling)

1368
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,091
- Sorry, old friend.

1369
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,096
Now, where's the
rest of your crew?

1370
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:19,507
- Let me get as close as
you can't, but cover me.

1371
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:27,815
(tank rumbling)

1372
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:50,638
- Everything seems clear.

1373
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:52,540
But, I can't see through metal.

1374
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,677
They're probably
dead, or dying inside.

1375
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:00,915
I just have to finish
them off by hand.

1376
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:10,591
(guns firing)

1377
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:44,158
(laughing)

1378
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:46,594
(gun firing)

1379
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:56,203
Stupid courage.

1380
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:08,516
(bomb exploding)

1381
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,685
(beeping)

1382
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:16,290
(metal creaking)

1383
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:21,896
- Hey, we did it!
- Duck!

1384
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:25,399
(gun firing)

1385
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:29,737
(squelching)

1386
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:33,441
- God damn thing.

1387
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:41,148
They'd be dead by now, if
I'd just used my own eyes.

1388
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:53,260
Well, then, I bet
she'll still follow me.

1389
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,298
(tank rumbling)

1390
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,210
That's right.

1391
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:12,013
Got too much blood on my
hands now to let me go.

1392
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:13,247
Come and get me.

1393
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:17,318
(tank rumbling)

1394
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,560
(beeping)

1395
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,728
- They're moving again.

1396
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,499
- The fools are moving
closer to Los Angeles.

1397
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,067
What are they doing?

1398
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:34,135
- You want me to guess?

1399
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:35,169
- Absolutely not.

1400
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,971
Where is Iron Thunder?

1401
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:39,607
- No sign of her, but if
they had her, we'd see her.

1402
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,409
- I can't stand
waiting any longer.

1403
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:42,943
Come on, we're going in.

1404
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:43,778
- What?

1405
01:34:45,146 --> 01:34:46,747
- I'm taking the chopper,
it's already rigged.

1406
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:50,017
- That bomb will vaporize
everything in a 400-foot radius.

1407
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:52,219
It'll blow out windows in
Calabasas, everyone will know.

1408
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:55,122
- Iron Thunder will reach
the outskirts of Los Angeles

1409
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:56,323
in less than an hour.

1410
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,260
We have to cut our losses.

1411
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:00,961
- What, by killing
Albright and the rest?

1412
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:04,331
- It's a terrible price to
pay, but it's a bargain.

1413
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:06,267
I can explain away an explosion,

1414
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:07,802
and the leftover
pieces aren't anything

1415
01:35:07,802 --> 01:35:10,438
that will expose or
destroy our program.

1416
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:13,774
It'll be a bit embarrassing,
but we can go on.

1417
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:15,843
And, believe me, we will go on.

1418
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:20,715
(dramatic music)

1419
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,939
(beeping)

1420
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:56,751
(tank rumbling)

1421
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:03,991
- There's no sign
of him up here.

1422
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:05,159
How about you?

1423
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:14,034
(dramatic music)
(tank rumbling)

1424
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:27,014
Ah!

1425
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:29,583
There he is, on the left, left!

1426
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,454
(cannon firing)

1427
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:36,290
(shell exploding)

1428
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:43,898
(tanks rumbling)
(dramatic music)

1429
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:25,739
- Goodbye.

1430
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:28,509
(dramatic music)

1431
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:58,472
(wind blowing)

1432
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:10,117
(somber music)

1433
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:57,224
(helicopter engine roaring)

1434
01:39:57,224 --> 01:39:58,525
- There.

1435
01:39:58,525 --> 01:39:59,526
There they are, sir.

1436
01:40:02,162 --> 01:40:03,497
Or rather, there they were.

1437
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,001
- Drop it, anyway.

1438
01:40:08,068 --> 01:40:09,503
- They're already dead, sir.

1439
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:11,805
- I don't care, I
don't want any trace.

1440
01:40:14,274 --> 01:40:15,109
Drop it.

1441
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:28,689
- Wait, wait, wait,
look, right down there.

1442
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:40,467
- Pick her up, and
we'll blast the rest.

1443
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:09,363
- Don't you recognize
the remote control?

1444
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:14,134
You may want to die
for the cause, I don't.

1445
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:21,475
- No, no, no!

1446
01:41:22,676 --> 01:41:25,045
(gun firing)

1447
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:27,548
- Oh, shit!
- Language.

1448
01:41:27,548 --> 01:41:30,417
(loud explosion)

1449
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:31,251
- No!

1450
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:36,390
(helicopter crashing)

1451
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:54,007
(birds chirping)

1452
01:42:13,994 --> 01:42:16,897
- They say, the lucky ones are
dead at the end of the war,

1453
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:21,969
because they can't remember.

1454
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:28,041
But, lucky or not, we're
the only ones left.

1455
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:35,649
And I noticed that you and
I have something in common.

1456
01:42:39,686 --> 01:42:42,923
I wondered what you could
tell me about that, huh?

1457
01:42:50,364 --> 01:42:51,732
I've been out here so long,

1458
01:42:53,433 --> 01:42:55,035
my memory's just a little fuzzy.

1459
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,173
My mind's a little
fuzzy too, to be honest,

1460
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:03,677
and I'm just more
than a little lonely.

1461
01:43:07,214 --> 01:43:11,385
So, tell me, what
did they do to us?

1462
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:16,423
Tell me, and I'll let ya live.

1463
01:43:23,163 --> 01:43:24,431
I shouldn't promise that.

1464
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,001
But I will, just this once.

1465
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:36,777
I don't make promises lightly.

1466
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:37,978
Tell me.

1467
01:43:37,978 --> 01:43:38,812
- Ahh.

1468
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:42,082
- You had your chance.

1469
01:43:44,751 --> 01:43:46,987
(clicking)

1470
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,624
There's a better way.

1471
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:53,760
Come on, you got one, too.

1472
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:00,934
Come on!

1473
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:19,820
(dramatic music)

1474
01:44:39,506 --> 01:44:42,109
Think you're done
with fighting, huh?

1475
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,176
I tried that.

1476
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:45,646
Didn't work for me,

1477
01:44:45,646 --> 01:44:49,583
and there's not a prayer in
hell of it working for you.

1478
01:44:51,585 --> 01:44:52,853
Come on.

1479
01:44:52,853 --> 01:44:54,187
Come on!

1480
01:44:54,187 --> 01:44:59,192
(suspenseful music)
(attacks pounding)

1481
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:39,833
Look at me, soldier.

1482
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:42,169
- Ugh!

1483
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:43,003
Ugh!

1484
01:45:45,405 --> 01:45:48,775
- I can't help but
kill, it's all I know,

1485
01:45:48,775 --> 01:45:50,711
but, if you stop me.

1486
01:45:50,711 --> 01:45:51,545
Ugh!

1487
01:45:53,814 --> 01:45:55,082
If you kill me,

1488
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:58,885
then you're making
a new man out of me.

1489
01:45:58,885 --> 01:45:59,720
- No!

1490
01:46:03,156 --> 01:46:08,161
(grunting)
(punches striking)

1491
01:46:08,895 --> 01:46:11,264
(suspenseful music)

1492
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:55,475
(birds squawking)

1493
01:47:01,214 --> 01:47:02,616
- Come back here!

1494
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:36,183
(attacks pounding)

1495
01:48:03,276 --> 01:48:05,946
(both groaning)

1496
01:48:46,486 --> 01:48:49,222
(head crunching)

1497
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:05,171
(birds chirping)

1498
01:49:11,711 --> 01:49:13,346
Can you help me, soldier?

1499
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:18,251
I've lost my watch.

1500
01:49:23,423 --> 01:49:25,258
I know it seems kinda silly,

1501
01:49:30,764 --> 01:49:32,399
but it's kind of special to me.

1502
01:49:37,103 --> 01:49:38,438
Can you help me?

1503
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:44,311
(melancholy music)

1504
01:50:11,738 --> 01:50:13,440
- Hold it right there.

1505
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,408
- Surrender or die, commie.

1506
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:17,577
- Hey, look, he's
a real Army guy.

1507
01:50:17,577 --> 01:50:18,511
- How do you know?

1508
01:50:18,511 --> 01:50:20,013
- Look at his uniform, stupid.

1509
01:50:21,081 --> 01:50:22,749
Is that your real blood?

1510
01:50:22,749 --> 01:50:25,218
- Yeah, we heard a big
bang and saw smoke.

1511
01:50:25,218 --> 01:50:26,953
- Yeah, what happened?

1512
01:50:27,854 --> 01:50:30,357
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1513
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:44,237
(serene music)

1514
01:51:07,394 --> 01:51:11,564
(gears turning
and tank rumbling)

1515
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:16,369
(inspirational music)
