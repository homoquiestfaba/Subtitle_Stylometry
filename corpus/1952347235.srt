00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:42,587
I CAN BLAME HIM.

52

WHO'S THAT?

118
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:03,087
- NO.  THAT WASN'T FORT WORTH.
- DAMN SURE WAS.

119
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:06,207
WE ESCORTED
THAT CATTLE BURSAR BACK--

120
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,109
THAT LITTLE
SQUIRRELLY GUY--

121
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,128
SHIT HIS PANTS

122
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,930
- All: OH!
- NO, IT'S KANSAS CITY
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

123
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:13,814
REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT
AND HEARD THAT NEGRO MUSIC?

124
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:19,120
(chuckling)
BOY, THAT WAS SOMETHING.

125
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:21,222
YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN OLD TOMMY,

126
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,924
DANCING UP THERE
WITH THEM NEGROES.

127
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,026
THAT WAS A SIGHT
TO BEHOLD.

128
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:27,278
- (footsteps approach)
- HEY, IS THIS YOUR BOY?

129
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:31,065
Tommy:
SON, THIS IS RED.

130
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,201
RED, THAT'S MY BOY, TRAV.

131
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:35,887
Red:
GOD DAMN.  HAS IT
BEEN THAT LONG?

132
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,391
YOU STILL HOOKED UP
WITH THAT LITTLE OLD GAL

133
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,359
THAT YOU MET
OVER IN SANTA FE?

134
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,365
THAT WAS--
THAT WAS TRAV'S MOM.

135
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:52,620
SHE TOOK-- TOOK ILL
A FEW YEARS BACK

136
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,073
AND WE LOST HER.

137
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:57,943
Red:
AW HELL,
THAT'S A SHAME.

138
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,811
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT, SON.

139
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:18,980
I DON'T KNOW, RED.
IT'S BEEN TOO DAMN LONG

140
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:21,782
SINCE I PULLED ANYTHING
LIKE THIS OFF.

141
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,451
I KNOW, I KNOW,
TOMMY, BUT LOOK--

142
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,569
IF WE GET A COUPLE
OF YOUR BOYS TO HELP US OUT,

143
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,939
WE COULD GET
THE DROP ON HIM.

144
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,674
IT'D BE EASY.

145
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,476
BESIDES THAT,
IT'S DIRTY MONEY.

146
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:34,228
THE LAW AIN'T GONNA
BE LOOKIN' FOR US.

147
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:37,381
LOOK, I AIN'T NEVER FORGOT
WHAT YOU DONE FOR ME.

148
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,667
MAYBE THIS'LL
MAKE US SQUARE.

149
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:42,169
RED, WE'RE SQUARE.

150
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,971
TOMMY, I DONE
TALKED TO YOUR BOYS.

151
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,191
I KNOW YOU'RE ABOUT
TO LOSE THE PLACE.

152
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,008
THIS MONEY COULD
SAVE THE RANCH.

153
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,977
AND ONE GOOD PAYDAY
FOR THIS OLD BOY--

154
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,030
MAYBE I COULD GET
OUT OF THIS BUSINESS

155
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:55,149
- BEFORE SOME DRUNKEN INDIAN--
- RED, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

156
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,953
THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK.

157
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,516
YEAH, TOMMY!
IT'S COME LOOSE.

158
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:14,286
WELL, CAN YOU FIX IT?

159
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:18,990
- I RECKON.
- WELL, GOD DAMN FIX IT!

160
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:21,309
HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO FIX IT BEFORE HE LEFT.

161
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,496
Tommy:
YEAH, HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

162
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:27,264
TOMMY, WHERE'S THIS
MONEY COME FROM?
WHO'S GOT IT?

163
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,967
WELL, THAT DON'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

164
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,119
IT'S JUST STOLEN MONEY.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

165
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,571
SO WE, UH--
WE FIND THIS GUY

166
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:35,990
- AND THEN WHAT?
- I DON'T HAVE TO FIND HIM.

167
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,493
RED ALREADY KNOWS
WHERE HE IS.

168
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:40,395
AND THEN WE KILL HIM?

169
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,297
OH, COME ON!
YOU THINK HE'S JUST
GONNA GIVE IT TO US?

170
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:46,751
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

171
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:49,020
WELL, YOU GOT ANOTHER IDEA,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

172
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,093
WHERE'S MY WHISKEY, GUNTER?

173
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:56,861
WELL, MAYBE WE DON'T
HAVE TO KILL HIM, ALL RIGHT?

174
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:58,763
IF HE'S ALL BY HIS-SELF,
WE CAN JUST WALTZ RIGHT IN

175
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:00,365
AND TAKE IT.

176
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:02,333
HELL, YOU KNOW HE'LL
JUST GIVE IT TO US.

177
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,452
YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM--
SHARPEST MIND IN TEXAS.

178
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,287
- WHERE'S MY WHISKEY?
- TOMMY, LISTEN!

179
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:08,289
LET'S DO IT!

180
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,024
HELL, I'LL DO IT.
I'LL KILL HIM, ALL RIGHT?

181
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,959
AND WE CAN STILL SPLIT
THE MONEY THREE WAYS.

182
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,395
WAY I FIGURE IT,
IT OUGHT TO GET ME
JUST ENOUGH MONEY--

183
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,231
- JUST ENOUGH MONEY TO GET ME
ON A SHIP TO JAY-PAN--
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KILL HIM?!

184
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,099
YOU JUST SUBDUE HIM
AND TAKE THE MONEY!

185
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,935
GUNTER, I COULD DO THAT

186
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:23,037
AND THEN I'D BE LOOKING
BACK OVER MY SHOULDER

187
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:27,041
- THE REST OF MY DAMN LIFE.
- TOMMY, THIS IS A MURDER!

188
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:32,630
TOMMY!

189
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:46,093
I AIN'T STUPID.

190
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:31,138
(sniffs)

191
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,893
YOUR GOING TO DO THIS
IN THE SHAPE YOU'RE IN?

192
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:10,494
DID YOUR FRIEND TELL YOU

193
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,247
IT WAS A LITTLE OLD LADY
HAD THIS MONEY?

194
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:15,683
CHRIST, GUNTER, WE DON'T
HAVE TO KILL NOBODY.

195
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,752
WE'LL JUST COVER OUR FACES
AND NOBODY'LL KNOW WHO
THE HELL WE ARE.

196
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:21,306
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
GO WRONG WITH THAT?

197
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:34,469
YOU ARE REALLY READY
TO START KILLING AGAIN?

198
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,071
IS THIS THE MAN
WHO MARRIES GLORIA?

199
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:38,889
NO.

200
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,166
GUNTER, WE GOT A LOT
A HISTORY BETWEEN US,

201
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:51,002
BUT I WON'T ABIDE
NO DISRESPECTFUL
TALK ABOUT GLORIA.

202
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:52,920
(sniffs)
SO JUST DROP IT, OKAY?

203
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:54,622
JUST DROP IT.

204
00:16:58,426 --> 00:17:01,379
- I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- THIS AIN'T NONE
OF YOUR AFFAIR.

205
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,283
IT IS.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS.

206
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:10,288
SOMEONE'S GOT TO KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU.

207
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:12,223
WELL THANKS, MOM.

208
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,242
(chuckling)

209
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:22,283
BUT I WON'T TAKE PART
IN THE TAKING OF SOMEONE'S LIFE.

210
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:24,886
- NO KILLING.
- GUNTER, IF I DON'T HAVE
TO KILL NOBODY, I WON'T.

211
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:27,238
NO KILLING.
PROMISE ME THAT!

212
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:42,236
ALL RIGHT, DOC.
NO KILLING.

213
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:45,206
NO KILLING.

214
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,546
OKAY?

215
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,200
OKAY.

216
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,130
(goat bleats)

217
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:36,957
DAMN IT, DAD,
THIS AIN'T RIGHT.
I SHOULD GO WITH YOU.

218
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,661
TRAVIS, WE ALREADY
TALKED ABOUT THAT.
I NEED YOU HERE.

219
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:42,046
WHAT IF YOU
RUN INTO SOME TROUBLE?

220
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,949
I'M GOOD WITH A PISTOL.
WILL'S BEEN TEACHING
ME HOW TO DRAW.  I--

221
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,601
SON!  NO!
END OF DISCUSSION.
YOU'RE NOT GOING.

222
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,739
YOU THINK YOUR MOM
WOULD WANT ME

223
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,891
- TO TAKE YOU
ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

224
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:55,626
DAD, I DON'T LIKE IT.

225
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:59,914
WELL I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER,
BUT THAT'S HOW IT IS.

226
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:04,952
(horse neighing)

227
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:12,443
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

228
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:16,347
- YEAH.
- Tommy: YOU GUYS READY?

229
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,882
Gunter:
LET'S GO!

230
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:20,618
Will:
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME A SECOND.

231
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,654
I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN WE GET BACK.

232
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,808
(thunder rumbling)

233
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,684
(townspeople bustling)

234
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,632
(laughing)

235
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:13,304
HEY, BOYS.

236
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:15,406
HOW WE DOING?

237
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,725
ALL RIGHT.

238
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,694
(all chatting)

239
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,935
SO, YA HEAR WHAT HAPPENED
TO OLD TUCKER TODAY?

240
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,239
HELL, HIS DONKEY
DONE KILLED HIM.

241
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
(all laughing)

242
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,010
Woman:
SWEAR TO GOD, IT THROWED
HIM AND HE BROKE HIS NECK.

243
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:37,778
YA'LL HEAR THAT?

244
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,014
TUCKER WAS KILLED
BY HIS DONKEY THIS MORNING.

245
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,969
SO THIS ONE'S FOR TUCKER--

246
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,821
TUCKER FROM ABBOTT.

247
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,426
DRINK UP EVERYBODY!

248
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:55,896
IT'S A TOAST TO MR. TUCKER!

249
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:57,281
SO, YOU GOIN'
TO THE BURIAL, MISS VIOLET?

250
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:59,450
HELL NO, SUGAR.

251
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:02,586
I LIKED HIS DONKEY
BETTER THAN I LIKED HIM.

252
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:04,789
- (hooves pounding)
- (men laughing)

253
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,101
HELLO, JAKE.

254
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,944
WHAT DO YA THINK?

255
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:28,712
ISN'T SHE PRETTY?

256
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,201
I NAMED HER ROSE.

257
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:39,339
GO ON.  LET MISS VIOLET
SHOW YOU AROUND.

258
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:55,623
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

259
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:09,420
(birds squawking)

260
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,846
(door creaks)

261
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:28,372
DON'T WORRY, HON.

262
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:30,541
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

263
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:33,627
I PROMISE.

264
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:52,980
Jake:
GET IN THE KITCHEN.

265
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:01,154
WELL, MY MY MY.

266
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:06,293
THERE'S NO CALL FOR THAT...

267
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,729
- NO CALL AT ALL--
- BEAR.

268
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,632
SO, WHAT'S THIS
NEWS, CASSANDRA?

269
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:13,968
WELL, I MET THIS GUY
OUT OF DEACON,

270
00:23:13,969 --> 00:23:17,588
HE FOUND HOSS AND THEM
UP TO RUTHERFORD PASS-- DEAD.

271
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,294
WHERE IS HE?

272
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:25,362
(doors open)

273
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:31,619
WELL, IT WAS
JUST DUMB LUCK, SIR.

274
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,353
I WAS OUT THERE RIDIN'
THE TRAIL AT FIRST LIGHT

275
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:35,022
AND ALMOST RAN OVER 'EM.

276
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:36,740
THERE WAS TWO OF 'EM,
PLUS ONE THAT WAS

277
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,576
LAYIN' OUT THERE IN THE WATER.

278
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:40,827
THREE?

279
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,263
YOU FIND ANYTHING ON THEM?

280
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:44,165
NO, I TOOK LEAVE
IN A REAL HURRY!

281
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,934
I THOUGHT WHOEVER DID
IT MIGHT, YOU KNOW,
MIGHT STILL BE AROUND.

282
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:48,952
THEY-- THEY WERE
SHOT UP REAL GOOD.

283
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:50,671
DID YOU TELL
ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS?

284
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,773
OH, NO NO NO NO.
J-- JUST YOUR MAN RIGHT THERE.

285
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:54,659
I TOLD HIM.
(chuckles)

286
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,877
Jake:
GOOD.  GOOD.

287
00:23:56,878 --> 00:23:59,997
WELL, I THOUGHT THERE
MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF REWARD.

288
00:23:59,998 --> 00:24:01,666
IT DON'T HAVE TO BE MUCH,

289
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,501
YOU KNOW, JUST A BOTTLE
OR SOMETHING.

290
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,219
(chuckles)

291
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:09,223
TAKE CARE OF HIM, BEAR.

292
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:11,142
- (laughs)
- Man: ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU SIR.

293
00:24:11,143 --> 00:24:12,809
- GOOD, THANK YOU.

294
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,311
Man:
GOOD DOIN' BUSINESS.

295
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:25,422
- (gunshot)
- (horses whinny)

296
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:39,003
WHAT THE HELL?

297
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:42,339
WHAT?  I TOOK CARE OF HIM.

298
00:24:45,126 --> 00:24:47,661
THAT ISN'T WHAT I MEANT!

299
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:49,747
WELL NOW,
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

300
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:54,568
GET TO RUTHERFORD PASS
AND FIND MY MONEY!

301
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,904
(muttering)
THAT'S USUALLY WHAT
PEOPLE MEAN WHEN THEY SAY

302
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:58,539
"TAKE CARE OF HIM."
I TAKE CARE OF HIM.

303
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,174
I TOOK CARE OF HIM.

304
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,809
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO WITH HIM?

305
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,428
- AND BE CLEAR.
- I DON'T CARE.

306
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,531
FEED HIM TO THE PIGS.

307
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:14,371
SO I'M FEEDING HIM
TO THE PIGS.

308
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:16,707
ALL RIGHT.

309
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,043
COME ON. YEAH.

310
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:23,730
SO THIS HENRY DAVID THOREAU

311
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,399
SAT AROUND
FOR A YEAR,

312
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,335
JUST BASICALLY WRITING
ABOUT SQUIRRELS HOLDING HANDS

313
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:31,772
AND TREES THAT NEEDED
TO BE WIPED DOWN AND--

314
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:33,874
YES, EVERY DAY.

315
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,910
TREES, GRASS, BIRDS.

316
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,795
WHO BUYS A BOOK LIKE THAT?

317
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:39,863
Gunter:
HE SPENT AN ENTIRE
YEAR DOING NOTHING...

318
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,301
BUT THINKING,

319
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:44,969
WATCHING AND WRITING.

320
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,703
Will:
WELL WHAT DID
HE WRITE ABOUT?

321
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:49,356
- Gunter: WHAT HE SAW.
- Will: WHAT DID HE SEE?

322
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,475
Gunter:
HE SAW LIFE.

323
00:25:51,476 --> 00:25:53,878
- (belches)
- Gunter: HE SAW
LIFE EVERYWHERE.

324
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:56,897
HE DIDN'T
WRITE ABOUT HUNTING?

325
00:25:56,898 --> 00:25:58,832
Gunter:
HE WAS A VEGETARIAN.

326
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,501
WELL, HOW'D HE
FEED HIMSELF?

327
00:26:00,502 --> 00:26:02,436
I DON'T UNDERSTAND A MAN
SITTING AROUND FOR A YEAR.

328
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,772
OH.  FAMILY BUSINESS,
AM I RIGHT?

329
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:09,776
- THEY MADE PENCILS.
- Will: THEY MAKE PENCILS.

330
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,512
- YEAH.
- (Will chuckles)

331
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:13,614
Will:
THERE YA GO.

332
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,816
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MAKING PENCILS?

333
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:17,718
Will:
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE OUGHT TO DO

334
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,353
WHEN WE GET BACK
TO THE RANCH.

335
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:21,154
ENOUGH OF THIS
RUNNING HERD AND WORRYING

336
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:23,190
ABOUT GUNS AND MONEY.
I SAY WE GROW PENCILS.

337
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:25,075
THAT'S WHAT
WE NEED TO DO.

338
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,361
WE'RE GONNA GROW PENCILS
RIGHT THERE AT THE RANCH.

339
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,597
- WE GONNA BE ROLLING
IN IT-- PENCILS!
- OH, WILL!

340
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:31,748
(Will laughs)

341
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:34,718
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I EVEN TALK TO YOU.

342
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,620
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
TALK TO ME.

343
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:40,024
I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE--

344
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:42,475
THE ONLY ONE
WHO'LL LISTEN.

345
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,578
NOW THAT'S THE TRUTH.

346
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:47,647
(man belches)

347
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,651
(crickets chirping,
owls hooting)

348
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:59,043
GOD DAMN, THAT WAS
A LONG RIDE TODAY.

349
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:03,497
MY ASS IS HURTIN'.

350
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:09,169
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU WEAR
THAT HAT IN A LONG TIME.

351
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:20,263
YEAH.

352
00:28:07,962 --> 00:28:09,813
(animal chattering)

353
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,482
(cawing)

354
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:54,190
(bell ringing)

355
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,582
(crowd chattering loudly)

356
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:19,933
Man:
HEY, TOMMY!

357
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:23,720
TOMMY JOE, OVER HERE!

358
00:29:26,608 --> 00:29:28,526
(laughing)

359
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:41,589
LOOK,

360
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,157
THERE AIN'T BEEN
NO KINDA MOVEMENT

361
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,691
IN THAT CABIN
SINCE WE BEEN HERE.

362
00:29:44,692 --> 00:29:46,760
I'M TELLING YOU WHAT--

363
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:48,612
- THAT MONEY'S IN THERE
WAITING FOR US.
- Gunter: NO--

364
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:51,281
- LET'S JUST GO IN AND TAKE IT.
- --THAT'S VERY UNLIKELY.

365
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:54,317
LISTEN HERE, DOC, ALL RIGHT?
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GET YOUR
HANDS DIRTY, YOU SHOULD'VE

366
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:57,237
- STAYED BACK AT THE RANCH.
- HEY! I DON'T RISK EVERYTHING
BECAUSE SOME IDIOT KID

367
00:29:57,238 --> 00:29:58,705
- CAN'T SIT STILL!
- Tommy: WILL YOU SHUT UP?

368
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,510
WHO YOU CALLING A KID?  HUH?

369
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,128
HUH?

370
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:07,881
Tommy:
OH SHIT.  RED!  DAMN!

371
00:30:07,882 --> 00:30:10,350
Red:
IT'S T.C. DAVIS.  I--
I SHOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING.

372
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:11,918
Tommy:
T.C. IS ONE
OF THE FEW GUYS

373
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,553
THAT'LL SHOOT
YOUR GODDAMN EYES OUT.

374
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:15,906
Red:
IF I TOLD YA,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COME.

375
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:18,241
- WELL, HELL NO,
I WOULDN'T HAVE COME--
- THERE'S FOUR OF US.

376
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:20,894
- Tommy: SHIT.
- Gunter: THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

377
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:23,781
- Will: HE'S ALL BY HIS SELF.
- LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA DO IT

378
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,499
JUST LIKE WE
PLANNED TO DO IT.

379
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:01,968
WILL AND RED--
THEY'RE OVER AT THE HOG-PEN.

380
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:05,205
WHAT THEY DOIN' OVER THERE?
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE, ARE THEY?

381
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:08,191
- Tommy: WELL, HELL NO, THEY--
- Red: TOMMY'S GONNA
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

382
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:11,629
HE'LL MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.
JUST HANG ON.

383
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,431
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?
- WAIT HERE.

384
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,233
- NO NO--
- WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY
BY THE TREE STUMPS

385
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:19,102
- LIKE YOU WERE
TOLD TO DO?
- THINGS CHANGE.

386
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:22,139
RED, WHY AM I
IN A GODDAMN BARN
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW?

387
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,808
- SETTLE DOWN.
- SLITHERING AROUND OUT THERE
IN YOUR GODDAMN RED SHIRT--

388
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:27,710
- SETTLE DOWN.
- --YOU LOOK LIKE
A GODDAMN MOVIN' BARN.

389
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,063
HOW YOU GONNA GET OVER THERE
WITHOUT HIM SEEING YOU?

390
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:31,899
I AIN'T GOIN'
OVER THERE.

391
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,234
- WHAT?
- I AIN'T WALKIN'
ACROSS THERE.

392
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:36,754
- Gunter: I THOUGHT
THAT WAS THE PLAN.
- Tommy: IT WAS THE PLAN.

393
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:39,773
WE WAIT FOR TOMMY
TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

394
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,808
WE DONE THIS BEFORE.

395
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:43,476
YEAH, I KNOW
YOU DONE IT BEFORE.

396
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:45,812
I HEARD ALL YOUR STORIES,
ALL YOUR GLORY STORIES.

397
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:47,981
NOBODY DYIN', SON.

398
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:50,283
- NOBODY DYIN'.
- YOU'RE GODDAMN
RIGHT NOBODY'S DYING.

399
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,419
- Red: THAT'S THE PLAN.
- 'CAUSE I'M TAKING OFF.

400
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,088
Red:
SETTLE DOWN NOW.
THAT'S DAVIS IN THERE.

401
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:58,592
RED, BLESS YOUR HEART.

402
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:01,795
- GOOD LUCK, OLD MAN.
- SHIT!  GOD DAMN IT!

403
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:06,032
Gunter:
AW, SHIT.

404
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:08,602
WHAT-- WHAT IS GOING ON?

405
00:32:08,603 --> 00:32:09,920
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

406
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:14,925
Gunter:
THAT SHIT-FOR-BRAINS,
HE'S GONNA GET KILLED!

407
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:16,593
Tommy:
I KNOW IT.

408
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:20,080
JESUS.

409
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,890
(whispering)
GO BACK.  WILL, GO BACK!

410
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:37,047

411
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:52,262
- TOMMY?

- Gunter: TOMMY-- NO!

414
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,160

415
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:11,331
Davis:
T.J. HILL!
I'VE GOT YOUR BOY!

416
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:18,021

(Will laughing)

424
00:33:47,952 --> 00:33:49,719
COME ON, RED.

425
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:55,375
Will:
LOOK AT YOU NOW, BIGGUN,
ALL DEAD AND SHIT.

426
00:33:55,376 --> 00:33:59,179
GUNTER, I'M GONNA GO

427
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,518
HELLFIRE!  WE DID IT!

428
00:34:13,494 --> 00:34:15,812
WELL, RED,
THAT AIN'T SO BAD, BUDDY.

429
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:18,431
- I'M ALL RIGHT.

430
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:22,402
HEY NOW!

431
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:29,676
Red:

00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:31,845
Will:

433
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:33,630
(laughing)
CHECK OUT THAT, BIGGUN.

434
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:35,065
Tommy:

435
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:36,900

436
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:39,069
(horse whinnies)

437
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,121
TOLD YA!
IT'S ALL UP HERE.

438
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,474
ALL UP HERE.

439
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:45,275
WHOO!

00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:52,082
LET'S GET THE MONEY.

441
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:54,951
AND THE GUNS.

442
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:59,472
CAN YOU
BELIEVE THIS?

443
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,308
JUST WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU PEOPLE ANYWAY?

444
00:35:36,243 --> 00:35:39,296
(crowd chattering,
shouting)

445
00:36:12,062 --> 00:36:14,631
(pulse beating)

446
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,635
(crying)

447
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:40,640
(crickets chirping)

448
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:46,145
Violet:
HE'S GONE NOW, HONEY.

449
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:48,548
COME ON.  I'M GONNA
TAKE YOU OUT OF HERE.

450
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:19,496
(horse neighs)

451
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:53,180
YOU KNOW, ROSE,

452
00:37:53,181 --> 00:37:56,716
MY FATHER WAS THE MEANEST
MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

453
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:01,438
THERE WAS THIS DAPPLE.

454
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,773
OH, SHE WAS A SIGHT.

455
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:07,027
I HAD IT IN MY MIND
THAT THE OLD MAN

456
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:09,045
WAS GONNA GIVE HER TO ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

457
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,616
BUT THEN ONE NIGHT,
THE DAPPLE ESCAPED

458
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:17,487
FROM THE RIDING STABLES.

459
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:20,524
AND ALL I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY
WAS A THRASHING.

460
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:22,258
(gasps)

461
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:25,729
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO DREAM, ROSE.

462
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,548
YOU GOTTA STEP UP
AND TAKE WHAT YOU WANT.

463
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:25,505
WHOA!

464
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:42,889
THERE WAS A FEW SURPRISES.

465
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,793
THIS BUNCH JUST SHOWED UP
OUT OF THE BLUE.

466
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:49,328
AND DAVIS?

467
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:51,381
HE'S DEAD.

468
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,817
THESE BOYS HAD HIM DOWN
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE.

469
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:03,360
LOCK THEM UP
WITH MY WILDCAT.

470
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,501
I'LL BE OVER DIRECTLY.

471
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,627
Bear:
SHUT YOUR GODDAMN MOUTH.

472
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,796
Will:
BEAR, YOU'RE ABOUT
A BIG HEADED SON-OF-A-BITCH.

473
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:27,633
I BET YOUR MAMA'S ASS HURT
FOR A WEEK WHEN YOU WAS BORN.

474
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:31,670
BONE UGLY TOO.

475
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:33,973
Bear:
KNOCK YA UPSIDE
YOUR HEAD, BOY.

476
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:38,912
FIRST DOOR ON YOUR LEFT.

477
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,369
- WELL, HELL, GIVE
ME SOME SUGAR--
- Bear: ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

478
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,488
YOU'RE ABOUT
A MEAN THING, BEAR.
SHE LIED TO ME.

479
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:55,228
GET REAL COMFORTABLE,
GENTLEMEN.

480
00:40:55,229 --> 00:40:57,663
PICK YOURSELF
A DANCE PARTNER,

481
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,450
- YOU'RE GONNA
BE HERE A WHILE.
- SO WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

482
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:02,902
Bear:
SUPPOSED TO WAIT
FOR BIG JAKE.

483
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:21,504
AFTERNOON, BOYS.

484
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,341
BEAR HERE TELLS ME
THAT YOU HAD A RUN-IN

485
00:41:25,342 --> 00:41:28,527
WITH AN OLD FRIEND
OF MINE THIS MORNING.

486
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,431
WE DIDN'T WANT TO SHOOT HIM.
HE-- HE WAS FIRING ON US.

487
00:41:31,432 --> 00:41:34,000
OH, I'M NOT SO WORRIED
ABOUT THAT, GENTLEMEN.

488
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:37,203
FACT IS, YOU DID
BEAR A FAVOR.

489
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:41,775
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS...

490
00:41:41,776 --> 00:41:44,560
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

491
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:53,036
- I WON'T ASK AGAIN--
- WE WERE AFTER THE DAMN MONEY.

492
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:56,022
WE DIDN'T SET OUT
TO KILL HIM.

493
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:57,940
AND HE HAD THE DROP ON US.

494
00:41:57,941 --> 00:42:00,042
- SO YOU WERE AFTER
THE MONEY, HUH?
- YEAH.

495
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:02,061
MY MONEY, OF COURSE?

496
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:03,880
Gunter:
WE DIDN'T KNOW IT
WAS YOUR MONEY, SIR.

497
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:05,598
WE DIDN'T KNOW.

498
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,618
WE-- WE THOUGHT IT CAME
FROM A BANK OR SOMETHING.

499
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:10,353
- WE DIDN'T--
- Gunter: I SWEAR TO GOD.

500
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:12,455
MAYBE YOU DID

501
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,207
AND MAYBE YOU DIDN'T.

502
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,713
- KILL 'EM.
- Gunter: WHAT?

503
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:22,615
- KILL 'EM ALL.
- Gunter: KILL US?

504
00:42:22,616 --> 00:42:26,019
Jake:
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH, BEAR?

505
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,720
Gunter:
SIR, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

506
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:29,955
- WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOUR--
- (blow thuds)

507
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:33,092
- (screams)
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YOU DID NOT HAVE TO DO THAT.

508
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,663
YOU DID NOT
HAVE TO DO THAT!

509
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:44,103
YOU WANT I SHOULD
KILL HER TOO?

510
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:47,841
WELL, WHY NOT?
TIME FOR A FRESH MOUNT.

511
00:42:48,992 --> 00:42:52,145
(Bear snickering)

512
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:54,447
NO HARD FEELINGS, VIOLET.

513
00:43:07,912 --> 00:43:09,512
COME FIRST LIGHT...

514
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:14,100
WE'RE GOING HUNTIN'.

515
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:15,968
(kicks bars)

516
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:23,209
- Will: THAT IS ONE
MEAN SON OF A BITCH.
- (Gunter groaning)

517
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,877
I DON'T THINK
HE'S AMERICAN NEITHER.

518
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:27,196
HE HITS LIKE ONE.

519
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:29,198
(chuckles)

520
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:31,868
WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

521
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:34,170
WHO ARE YOU CLOWNS ANYWAY?

522
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:36,989
- Will: GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY--
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

523
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,858
I'M VIOLET...

524
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:40,993
TILL TOMORROW, ANYWAY.

525
00:43:42,863 --> 00:43:45,331
THAT BIG GUY--
WITH THE RIFLE--

526
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:47,133
HE REALLY PLANNING
ON KILLING US?

527
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:49,219
OH YEAH.
HE SURE HE IS.

528
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,621
THAT MONSTER-- BEAR--

529
00:43:51,622 --> 00:43:54,574
SUGAR, HE'S GONNA MAKE
A SPORT OUT OF THAT.

530
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:56,893
NOT IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT, HE WON'T.

531
00:43:56,894 --> 00:43:58,561
WELL, YOU DON'T.

532
00:43:58,562 --> 00:44:00,930
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SHUT THE HELL UP?

533
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:04,284
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
MY LAST NIGHT OF PEACE HERE.

534
00:44:04,285 --> 00:44:07,670
DAMN, YOU SURE
ARE A LOAD A LAUGHS,
FOR A SPORTING GIRL.

535
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:09,806
YOU NEED TO TAKE
OFF THAT DRESS IS
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

536
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:12,358
Violet:
OH PISS OFF, YA HALF-WIT

537
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,460
MOUTH BREATHER.

538
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:16,395
(chuckling)
I LIKE HER ALREADY.

539
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:18,030
Tommy:
WHY DON'T Y'ALL SHUT UP

540
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,666
AND JUST LET ME
THINK FOR A MINUTE?

541
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,434
WELL, THINK ALL YOU WANT,
OLD TIMER.

542
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:24,253
'CAUSE IT'S
OVER AT DAWN.

543
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,248
(sighs)

544
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:37,099
(dog barks)

545
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:24,964
WHAT, JAKE?

546
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:27,867
NO!  NO!  NO!

547
00:45:27,868 --> 00:45:31,671
NO!  NO!

548
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:33,740
JAKE, NO!

549
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:35,274
NO!

550
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,194
Violet:
YOU JUST LEAVE ME
THE HELL ALONE, JAKE!

551
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:44,517
(Jake grunts)

552
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:49,388
DAMN, JAKE!

553
00:45:55,479 --> 00:45:57,813
YOU SHOULD'VE
LEFT ME IN THERE, JAKE.

554
00:45:57,814 --> 00:46:00,749
Jake:
I THINK NOT.

555
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,952
(Violet and Jake laugh)

556
00:46:06,957 --> 00:46:08,908
(rooster crows)

557
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,688
(knocking)

558
00:46:22,689 --> 00:46:24,774
UH, JAKE,
I NEED THE KEYS.

559
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:27,810
Jake:
I TOLD YOU!

560
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:29,729
- IT'S ON THE GODDAMN BAR!
- HEY-- I KNOW.

561
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,397
I-- I CHECKED EVERYWHERE.

562
00:46:31,398 --> 00:46:33,032
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

563
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:42,559
DAMN!

564
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:53,869
Jake:
SO WHAT HAVE YOU
FOULED UP TODAY, BEAR?

565
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,358
I'LL COME BACK
FOR YOU, I PROMISE.

566
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:19,662
Will:
AIN'T THAT A DAMN PEACH?

567
00:47:19,663 --> 00:47:23,499
- THEY SENT HER TO KILL US.
- DOES HE EVER SHUT UP?

568
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,618
Tommy:
HE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

569
00:47:27,454 --> 00:47:29,455
Will:
GET YOUR IRONS.  LET'S GO.

570
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:47,824
Violet:
NOW THEM HORSES
IS READY, BOYS.

571
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:51,711
- (gunshot)
- HYA!

572
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:54,314
- (horses whinnying)
- AW, HELL!

573
00:47:54,315 --> 00:47:56,248
YOU'RE GONNA BLAME
THIS ON ME, AIN'T YA?

574
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,017
- GET AFTER THEM!
- COME ON, LET'S GO!

575
00:48:08,612 --> 00:48:10,512
Violet:
TOMMY!

576
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:17,387
- TAKE A LEFT AT THEM TREES!
- Will: TOMMY KNOWS WHAT TO DO!

577
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:19,155
WE DON'T NEED
TO LISTEN TO YOU!

578
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:31,851
Gunter:
TOMMY!  SHE'S GOT AN IDEA!

579
00:48:31,852 --> 00:48:34,286
Will:
TOMMY, WHAT ARE WE DOING
LISTENING TO HER?

580
00:48:37,174 --> 00:48:39,975
Violet:
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TOMMY HILL!

581
00:48:39,976 --> 00:48:43,879
WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN? TOMMY!

582
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,098
Bear:
GOD DAMN IT!

583
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:51,571
HOLD UP HERE
A SECOND, BOYS.

584
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:53,672
I THINK THEY HEADED UP
TOWARDS THAT DRY CREEK UP THERE.

585
00:48:53,673 --> 00:48:55,891
COME ON, LETS GO!

586
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:03,632
Will:
I DON'T TRUST HER.

587
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:05,434
Violet:
I'M RIGHT HERE, YOU KNOW?

588
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:07,769
Will:
YEAH, WELL, I'M RIGHT HERE.
I DON'T TRUST YOU!

589
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,206
WELL, I'M GONNA TRY
REAL HARD NOT TO GET
TOO BROKEN UP ABOUT THAT.

590
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:20,900
WHERE THE HELL
ARE WE GOIN'?

591
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:22,802
WE'RE GOING UP
TO THEM TREES.

592
00:49:22,803 --> 00:49:25,704
LOOKS LIKE A GREAT PLACE
TO GET TRAPPED.

593
00:49:25,705 --> 00:49:27,990
Violet:
IT'S OKAY.  I KNOW
THIS MOUNTAIN.

594
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:29,975
I CAN GET US
OUT OF HERE.

595
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:31,844
WHY DO YOU
LISTEN TO HER?

596
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,415
HEY, THEY'RE
AFTER ME TOO.

597
00:49:45,175 --> 00:49:47,243
Tommy:
COME ON, BEAR,
YA DUMB BASTARD!

598
00:49:47,244 --> 00:49:49,545
HOLD ON.
YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

599
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:52,381
Violet:
BEAR!

600
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:54,666
BEAR!  COME ON, BEAR!

601
00:49:56,837 --> 00:49:59,371
COME ON.

602
00:50:02,175 --> 00:50:03,709
SEE?

603
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:29,601
YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOIN'?

604
00:50:29,602 --> 00:50:31,237
WELL, I'M GONNA
GO FIND A TRAIL.

605
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:33,272
THERE'S A TRAIL
TO A LAKE...

606
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:35,425
- RIGHT UP THIS
RIDGE, I BELIEVE.
- Bear: TOMMY HILL!

607
00:50:35,426 --> 00:50:37,460
(guns blasting)

608
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:54,893
GET BEHIND
THIS ROCK, BOYS.

609
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:57,062
BEAR, THIS IS SOME
SHIT YOU GOT US INTO.

610
00:50:57,063 --> 00:51:00,365
Bear:
SHUT THE HELL UP, CLARK
OR I'M GONNA TEAR YOU APART

611
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:02,268
- AND PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER--
- Clark: THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!

612
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:04,302
Bear:
WELL, JUST KEEP SHOOTIN'!
SHOOT SOMETHING!

613
00:51:04,303 --> 00:51:06,172
(guns blasting)

614
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:07,656
JUST COVER ME, OKAY?

615
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:10,159
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

616
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,060
I AIN'T GOT A SHOT!

617
00:51:12,061 --> 00:51:14,230
WELL FOR GOD'S SAKES,
HIT SOMETHING!

618
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:16,799
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU SEE?

619
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,568
(screams)
DAMN!

620
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:31,380
NEVER FELT BETTER, TOMMY!

621
00:51:48,998 --> 00:51:51,650
(Violet howls)

622
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:31,990
SHIT, THEY LEFT!

623
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:47,439
(crickets chirping)

624
00:53:00,587 --> 00:53:02,955
THANK YOU FOR WORKING
WITH ME BACK THERE.

625
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:08,026
I'D SAY THAT
MAKES US ABOUT EVEN.

626
00:53:09,612 --> 00:53:11,980
DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU?

627
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,166
Violet:
IT'S A DEAL.

628
00:53:58,511 --> 00:54:00,729
TOMMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

629
00:54:02,065 --> 00:54:03,766
I'M TRYING
TO GO TO SLEEP.

630
00:54:04,935 --> 00:54:06,985
I CAN SEE THAT.

631
00:54:06,986 --> 00:54:09,087
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON THE GROUND?

632
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,612
I'M OKAY HERE.

633
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:21,149
WELL, IT'S KINDA STUPID

634
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,651
FOR YOU TO SLEEP
ON THE GROUND.

635
00:54:22,652 --> 00:54:25,354
PLENTY OF ROOM
RIGHT HERE.

636
00:54:25,355 --> 00:54:27,756
WELL, JUST ENJOY IT THEN.

637
00:54:29,676 --> 00:54:33,996
- OKAY.
- LISTEN, I'M JUST
NOT INTERESTED.

638
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:36,231
OH, DEAR GOD.

639
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:42,838
I KNOW YOUR TYPE.

640
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,606
YOU THINK YOU
KNOW MY TYPE?

641
00:54:44,607 --> 00:54:48,127
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME, TOMMY.

642
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:12,318
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT
LIKE IT SOUNDED.

643
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,837
I JUST MEANT WOMEN,
THAT'S ALL.

644
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:19,425
OKAY.

645
00:55:58,297 --> 00:56:00,483
Will:
TOMMY?

646
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:03,102
TOMMY?

647
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:06,789
- Tommy: WHAT THE HELL?
- WHAT IS IT?

648
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:11,393
NONE OF Y'ALL MOVE.

649
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:15,280
WHAT'S GOING ON?

650
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:17,399
I THINK WE GOT US A SNAKE.

651
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,519
(laughing)
OH, SHIT!

652
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,688
WHAT IS SO
COTTON-PICKIN' FUNNY?

653
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:24,890
Tommy:
WELL, DID HE BITE YOU?

654
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:27,292
NOT YET.

655
00:56:27,293 --> 00:56:31,797
HE'S ABOUT
COILED UP ON MY LEG.

656
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:33,482
MAYBE YOU CAN
JUST JUMP OUT.

657
00:56:33,483 --> 00:56:35,584
(sighs)
YES, AT SOME POINT,

658
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:37,653
I PLAN ON
JUMPIN' OUT, GUNTER.

659
00:56:37,654 --> 00:56:40,155
WHAT DO WE DO?

660
00:56:40,156 --> 00:56:42,875
- UH-OH.
- Gunter: WHAT'S WRONG?

661
00:56:44,744 --> 00:56:47,162
- I GOT A STIRRIN' DOWN BELOW.
- JUST HOLD ON--

662
00:56:47,163 --> 00:56:49,681
THIS IS WHAT COMES
FROM A MAN WHO EATS
NOTHING BUT BEANS, TOMMY.

663
00:56:49,682 --> 00:56:51,449
- (rattling)
- Tommy: DON'T DO THAT!

664
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,802
UH-OH.

665
00:56:53,803 --> 00:56:56,004
- (passes gas)
- (screams)

666
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:58,940
GOD DAMN IT TO HELL!
(screams)

667
00:56:58,941 --> 00:57:02,645
- GOD!  SON OF A GOOD GOD!
- (hissing, rattling)

668
00:57:02,646 --> 00:57:05,064
DAMN!  HOLY JEHOSOPHAT!

669
00:57:05,065 --> 00:57:08,183
HE BIT ME!
GOD DAMN!  TOMMY!

670
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,905
- GOD!
- Tommy: HOW IS HE?

671
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:17,342
WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM
TO REAL DOCTOR.

672
00:57:17,343 --> 00:57:18,877
Violet:
YOU AIN'T NO REAL DOCTOR?

673
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:20,612
IT'S A NICKNAME.

674
00:57:20,613 --> 00:57:22,264
BITE ON THIS.

675
00:57:26,603 --> 00:57:29,238
THE CLOSEST TOWN'S
SAN ANTON'.

676
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:31,290
WILL, THAT'S
A TWO-DAY RIDE.

677
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:33,359
Will:
I CAN MAKE IT.

678
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,645
OW!  GOD, DOC!

679
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:38,513
Tommy:
WE KNOW FOR SURE
THAT BEAR AND HIS GUYS

680
00:57:38,514 --> 00:57:42,067
- ARE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
- I SAID I CAN MAKE IT.

681
00:57:42,068 --> 00:57:44,269
(screams)

682
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,255
DOC!

683
00:57:55,682 --> 00:57:58,584
(Will slurring)
'CAUSE THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU GOT--

684
00:57:58,585 --> 00:58:00,786
(coughing)

685
00:58:00,787 --> 00:58:03,705
I'M GONNA CATCH THAT--
GOTTA GO TO JAY-PAN.

686
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:05,307
- (fire crackling)
- (coughing)

687
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,438
- (horses whinny)
- (Will grunts)

688
00:58:24,861 --> 00:58:27,246
- (Will screaming)
- Gunter: I'M SORRY, WILL.

689
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:30,099
- I'M SORRY.
- I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD, TOMMY.

690
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,000
- Tommy: I'M SURE YOU DON'T.
- TOMMY, I'M SORRY I--

691
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:33,936
- Tommy: THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- I GOT TO GO.

692
00:58:33,937 --> 00:58:37,339
- Gunter: LIE DOWN.
- (coughing)

693
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,040
(all chatting)

694
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,695
(Will screams)

695
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,685
(yawns)

696
00:58:55,424 --> 00:58:56,959
(sighs)

697
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,263
WELL, I SURE
COULD USE A WHISKEY.

698
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:23,252
Gunter:
YEAH.

699
00:59:23,253 --> 00:59:25,019
SO WHAT'S HIS STORY--

700
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,426
TOMMY?  AN OUTLAW OR WHAT?

701
00:59:31,561 --> 00:59:33,512
WELL,

702
00:59:33,513 --> 00:59:36,114
THAT IS A HARD QUESTION.

703
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:45,140
HE IS... ALL THAT.

704
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:46,675
UH--

705
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:52,448
I HAVE KNOWN TOMMY
SINCE I WAS A YOUNG MAN.

706
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:55,684
HE USED TO RIDE
WITH A GANG THAT, UH--

707
00:59:58,955 --> 01:00:01,022
WELL, THEY KILLED MY FAMILY.

708
01:00:02,325 --> 01:00:04,526
AND THEY LEFT
TOMMY BEHIND TO MOP UP.

709
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,782
I WAS STILL ALIVE
WHEN TOMMY FOUND ME.

710
01:00:13,603 --> 01:00:15,987
HE POINTED HIS GUN
STRAIGHT AT ME

711
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:18,240
IN ORDER TO FINISH ME OFF.

712
01:00:20,593 --> 01:00:22,878
AND I WANTED HIM TO DO IT.

713
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,901
MY FAMILY WAS NEW
TO AMERICA AND...

714
01:00:32,472 --> 01:00:34,155
NOW THEY WERE DEAD
AND I WAS ALONE

715
01:00:34,156 --> 01:00:36,007
IN THIS HARSH LAND.

716
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:40,628
DAMN.

717
01:00:40,629 --> 01:00:42,597
WHAT HAPPENED?

718
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,702
HE COULDN'T DO IT.

719
01:00:46,703 --> 01:00:48,469
HE TOLD ME YEARS LATER

720
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,172
THAT, UH--

721
01:00:52,809 --> 01:00:54,943
SOMETHING HAPPENED
AT THAT MOMENT

722
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:56,528
AND, UH, HE COULDN'T DO IT.

723
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:58,163
(laughs)

724
01:01:03,252 --> 01:01:05,604
SO HE LET YOU GO.

725
01:01:05,605 --> 01:01:08,624
HE TOOK ME IN,

726
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,859
TOOK CARE OF MY WOUNDS,

727
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:14,329
GAVE ME A PLACE
TO WORK AND LIVE.

728
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:18,517
I'VE BEEN WITH HIM
EVER SINCE.

729
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:23,921
HE'S A GOOD MAN--

730
01:01:23,922 --> 01:01:26,291
AT LEAST HE TRIES TO BE.

731
01:01:29,996 --> 01:01:34,115
- (bell ringing)
- GUNTER, YOU TAKE
THAT BELL TOWER.

732
01:01:34,116 --> 01:01:37,002
JUST KEEP A GOOD WATCH.
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO.

733
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:40,589
I'LL BE OVER
TAKIN' CARE OF WILL.

734
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:44,809
- ALL RIGHT.
- WELL, BEAR AND HIS BOYS,

735
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,645
THEY'LL BE HERE BY TOMORROW.

736
01:01:46,646 --> 01:01:48,964
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.

737
01:01:48,965 --> 01:01:50,432
I HOPE THEY ARE.

738
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:52,917
I'M READY TO GET
THIS OVER WITH.

739
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:14,939
(coughing)

740
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:33,725
(coughing)

741
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,740
Will:
YOU REAL PRETTY.
YOU GOT PRETTY EYES.

742
01:02:53,879 --> 01:02:56,264
(inhales)
THAT'S REAL PRETTY.

743
01:02:56,265 --> 01:02:59,167
MY NAME IS WILL--

744
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:02,654
WILLIAM DAVID THOREAU.

745
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:06,491
- I WRITE BOOKS, MOSTLY.
- WHAT ABOUT?

746
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:08,960
OH, I WRITE ABOUT

747
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:12,214
TREES AND FROGS AND--

748
01:03:13,983 --> 01:03:16,718
YOU KNOW-- LIFE,

749
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:19,154
PONDS AND SHIT LIKE THAT.

750
01:03:19,155 --> 01:03:20,789
- YOU EVER HEARD OF ME?
- YEAH.

751
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,192
I'M GONNA TAKE ME
A SHIP TO JAY-PAN.

752
01:03:23,193 --> 01:03:26,128
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?
YOU WANNA COME WITH ME?

753
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:28,063
YEAH, SURE YOU ARE.

754
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:33,668
AIN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF ME?

755
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:35,587
YEAH.

756
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,492
Y'ALL DON'T NEED
ANY PENCILS, DO YA?

757
01:03:40,493 --> 01:03:42,811
(chortles)

758
01:04:04,684 --> 01:04:09,104
TOMMY, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WAS WITH A WOMAN?

759
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:13,057
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- (laughs)

760
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:17,112
- IF YOU ASK ME,
I REALLY BELIEVE--
- I DIDN'T ASK YOU.

761
01:04:17,113 --> 01:04:20,214
I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT ALL YOUR DRINKING

762
01:04:20,215 --> 01:04:23,201
AND YOUR RAGING
AND ALL YOUR CARRYING-ON--

763
01:04:23,202 --> 01:04:25,970
IT'S A SURE SIGN
OF A MAN WITHOUT A WOMAN.

764
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:29,574
I THINK YOU'RE LONELY,
TOMMY HILL.

765
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,493
(chuckles)

766
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,162
YOU'RE WORSE THAN GUNTER.

767
01:04:37,233 --> 01:04:38,950
IF YOU SURVIVE
JAKE AND BEAR...

768
01:04:40,636 --> 01:04:42,687
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO THINK
ABOUT SETTLING DOWN AGAIN,

769
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,475
MAKE ANOTHER GO OF IT.

770
01:04:48,577 --> 01:04:51,046
WELL, I VERY SELDOM TAKE
ADVICE FROM SPORTIN' GALS.

771
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:55,483
TO HELL WITH YOU,
TOMMY HILL.

772
01:04:55,484 --> 01:04:57,352
HELL, YOU'RE
SO OLD AND DAMN GIMPY,

773
01:04:57,353 --> 01:05:00,422
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
FALL DOWN WITHOUT HELP.

774
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,942
(chuckling)

775
01:05:06,128 --> 01:05:09,197
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, TOMMY.

776
01:05:09,198 --> 01:05:11,166
JAKE'S LIKELY
TO PULL YOUR SKIN OFF

777
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,217
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

778
01:05:13,218 --> 01:05:15,687
AND BEAR--

779
01:05:15,688 --> 01:05:17,622
HONEY, YOU DON'T KNOW BEAR.

780
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:21,226
THAT MAN LIVES
FOR SLOW KILLINGS.

781
01:05:24,697 --> 01:05:26,981
WELL, BRING 'EM ON.
I'M TIRED OF WAITING.

782
01:05:30,202 --> 01:05:33,021
DON'T BE STUPID, TOMMY.

783
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:35,106
PLEASE DON'T BE STUPID.

784
01:06:00,065 --> 01:06:02,467
YOU KNOW,
MISS KATHERINE,

785
01:06:02,468 --> 01:06:04,252
ME AND TOMMY,
WE GOT A SPREAD

786
01:06:04,253 --> 01:06:06,287
JUST EAST A HERE
THAT MAKES THIS PLACE

787
01:06:06,288 --> 01:06:09,057
LOOK LIKE CACTUS GROWING
OUT OF A HORSE TURD.

788
01:06:43,442 --> 01:06:45,142
Bear:
TOMMY!

789
01:06:46,596 --> 01:06:49,997
TOMMY HILL!

790
01:06:49,998 --> 01:06:51,633
CAN YOU HEAR ME, BOY?!

791
01:06:52,685 --> 01:06:55,737
TOMMY HILL!

792
01:06:55,738 --> 01:06:58,039
YOU'RE SCARED SHITLESS!

793
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:06,398
TOMMY!

794
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,584
(gunshot)

795
01:07:09,585 --> 01:07:11,902
(birds squawking)

796
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:15,306
Tommy:
BEAR!

797
01:07:28,037 --> 01:07:29,671
(guns blasting)

798
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:00,869
(screams)

799
01:08:10,529 --> 01:08:12,380
(yells)

800
01:08:23,742 --> 01:08:25,977
(gasping)

801
01:08:25,978 --> 01:08:28,813
I SHOT YOUR BOY, TOMMY.

802
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,407
- Clark: BEAR!
- (guns blasting)

803
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:42,444
(grunts)

804
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:54,705
Violet:
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, TOMMY?
WHERE ARE WE HEADED?

805
01:08:54,706 --> 01:08:56,274
Tommy:
TRAVIS!

806
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:00,378
Will:
MY FOOT HURTS!

807
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:09,604
Man:
TOMMY!  TOMMY!

808
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,974
TOMMY!

809
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:16,094
Tommy:
WHERE'S TRAVIS, BUZZARD?

810
01:09:16,095 --> 01:09:18,346
Buzzard:
HE'S ALL RIGHT.  I GOT HIM
IN THE OLD SANCHEZ PLACE,

811
01:09:18,347 --> 01:09:19,981
DOWN IN THE CANYON.

812
01:09:21,217 --> 01:09:23,184
HE TOOK TWO BULLETS.

813
01:09:23,185 --> 01:09:26,354
THEM BASTARDS CAME IN
SHOOTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVED,

814
01:09:26,355 --> 01:09:29,257
THREE OF 'EM--
ONE BIGGUN.

815
01:09:29,258 --> 01:09:30,992
THE LUCKY THING IS,
TRAVIS PASSED OUT

816
01:09:30,993 --> 01:09:33,227
AND THEY TOOK HIM
FOR DEAD.

817
01:09:33,228 --> 01:09:36,714
- HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
- YEAH, HE JUST
NEEDS SOME REST.

818
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:39,400
WHAT THE HELL
Y'ALL GOT INTO?

819
01:09:39,401 --> 01:09:41,853
BIG JAKE AND BEAR
DID THIS.

820
01:09:41,854 --> 01:09:44,873
AND THEY DAMN SURE
KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT TOO.

821
01:09:44,874 --> 01:09:46,607
LOOKING OVER
OUR SHOULDERS--

822
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,378
WE GOING AFTER
THIS BIG JAKE? HUH?

823
01:09:50,379 --> 01:09:53,064
NO, TOMMY,
THAT'S SUICIDE.

824
01:09:59,337 --> 01:10:02,223
- I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- I'M GOING TOO.

825
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:03,992
WE COME ALL THIS WAY.

826
01:10:22,327 --> 01:10:23,961
DAD...

827
01:10:26,315 --> 01:10:28,249
I'M SORRY.

828
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:36,374
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SON.

829
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,893
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

830
01:11:00,983 --> 01:11:02,567
(sighs)

831
01:11:12,361 --> 01:11:14,445
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, VIOLET?

832
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:21,019
VIOLET?

833
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,570
WHAT, TOMMY?

834
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,311
YOU KNOW, I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET

835
01:11:30,312 --> 01:11:33,531
- INVOLVED WITH
A WOMAN AGAIN.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

836
01:11:33,532 --> 01:11:35,499
- YOU ALREADY
TOLD ME ALL THIS.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

837
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,218
LET ME FINISH.

838
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:40,788
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO OFFER.

839
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:45,276
I DRINK A LOT
AND I AIN'T GOT NO HOME.

840
01:11:45,277 --> 01:11:48,179
YOU SURE KNOW HOW
TO SELL YOURSELF.

841
01:11:50,315 --> 01:11:52,850
I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYIN' TO SAY IS

842
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:55,186
I WOULDN'T MIND
RUNNING INTO YOU AGAIN.

843
01:11:58,473 --> 01:12:00,374
THAT'S QUITE AN OFFER.

844
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:03,078
THAT'S QUITE
AN INVITATION.

845
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:05,947
WELL, I WAS--
I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE--

846
01:12:07,516 --> 01:12:09,617
MAYBE WE COULD MEET
IN THE MIDDLE OR SOMETHING.

847
01:12:11,303 --> 01:12:13,021
WE'LL SEE, TOMMY.

848
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:17,958
WE'LL SEE.

849
01:12:23,031 --> 01:12:24,616
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE.

850
01:12:30,456 --> 01:12:32,523
(crying)

851
01:12:49,191 --> 01:12:52,310
MA'AM.  JAKE WANTED
ME TO LET HIM KNOW
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED.

852
01:12:54,697 --> 01:12:56,981
CODY SAID
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

853
01:12:56,982 --> 01:12:58,999
Jake:
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

854

IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

863
01:13:56,675 --> 01:13:58,743
YOU SLOW DOWN
A LITTLE BIT, WILLIAM.

864
01:14:00,346 --> 01:14:02,046

872
01:14:58,587 --> 01:15:01,189
YOUR HANDS ARE SHAKING.

01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:04,259
WELL, I AIN'T DRINKIN'

TRY IT AGAIN.

876
01:15:35,858 --> 01:15:37,491
Violet:
HEY, BILLY!

877
01:15:50,622 --> 01:15:53,941

SHE COULD BE YOUR
GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER, JAKE.

01:16:12,677 --> 01:16:15,613
YOU CAME BACK

884
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:17,181

885
01:16:25,774 --> 01:16:27,658
TIRED OF YOUR
NEW BOYFRIENDS, ARE YOU?

886
01:16:29,327 --> 01:16:31,062

THEN WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

888
01:16:36,835 --> 01:16:40,254
I DON'T KNOW.
I LEFT 'EM BACK IN DEACON.

889
01:16:40,255 --> 01:16:42,924
BEAR'S GOT 'EM

01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:44,858

01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:47,261
TRYING TO LOSE
THEIR OWN SHADOWS.

892
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,899
I GUESS NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE
GUNNIN' FOR THE BOTH OF US.

893
01:16:53,102 --> 01:16:54,735

Jake:

THANK YOU.

SUGAR, I GOT SOMETHING

911
01:19:07,185 --> 01:19:09,053
LET'S HEAR IT.

912
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:16,127

GO ON.

916
01:19:31,276 --> 01:19:33,677
WELL, THEY'RE

AND GUN DOWN
EVERYBODY THEY FIND.

919
01:19:36,948 --> 01:19:39,316
NO SURPRISES,
NO AMBUSHES--

920
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:42,036
AN UNBELIEVABLY
STUPID GESTURE.

01:20:12,234 --> 01:20:14,018
TWO NIGHTS FROM NOW.

930
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,143
(slams glass)

931
01:20:25,013 --> 01:20:27,180
WELL DONE, GIRL.

932
01:20:28,316 --> 01:20:31,018

I PROMISE YOU
WON'T GET NO MORE

935
01:20:37,058 --> 01:20:38,926

01:20:41,012 --> 01:20:44,448
BUT THEY DAMN SURE
BETTER BE WHERE YOU SAY.

01:20:50,138 --> 01:20:53,340
I'LL TEAR YOU TO PIECES
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,833
YEAH.

940
01:21:06,521 --> 01:21:09,257
YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A DAY

941
01:21:09,258 --> 01:21:12,759
SO YOU'LL
HAVE TO MAKE GOOD TIME.

942
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,762
A GOLD PIECE

943
01:21:14,763 --> 01:21:17,914
TO THE MAN THAT KILLS
THIS TOMMY HILL.

944
01:21:26,958 --> 01:21:28,675
YOU BOYS
KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED.

945
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:45,559
(rooster crows)

946
01:21:50,682 --> 01:21:52,749
(gunshot)

947
01:22:08,617 --> 01:22:11,101
(loud blast)

948
01:22:11,102 --> 01:22:13,036
(thunder rumbling)

949
01:22:26,834 --> 01:22:28,819
(crickets chirping)

950
01:22:41,366 --> 01:22:44,151
(gun clicks)

951
01:23:19,754 --> 01:23:21,522
GET UP.

952
01:23:26,027 --> 01:23:28,629
GET UP AND GET ME
SOME COFFEE!

953
01:23:57,141 --> 01:23:59,693
Jake:
WHAT THE HELL
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

954
01:24:01,896 --> 01:24:03,947
YOU!

955
01:24:05,216 --> 01:24:07,785
YOU ARE ONE DEAD
SON OF A BITCH.

956
01:24:07,786 --> 01:24:10,888
I'D BE WORRYIN' ABOUT MYSELF
RIGHT NOW IF I WAS YOU.

957
01:24:11,823 --> 01:24:14,207
VIOLET!

958
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,659
(footsteps)

959
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:23,533
Tommy:
GET DOWN HERE, JAKE!

960
01:24:39,601 --> 01:24:43,003
NOW... I GOT A LOT
OF MONEY HERE.

961
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:47,575
A LOT MORE THAN
YOU GENTLEMEN NEED.

962
01:24:47,576 --> 01:24:49,477
GET OVER HERE, DAMN IT.

963
01:24:49,478 --> 01:24:51,612
OH, SURE, I'M UNARMED.

964
01:24:51,613 --> 01:24:53,347
(chuckles)
PUT A BULLET IN MY FACE.

965
01:24:53,348 --> 01:24:55,583
OH, I COULD SHOOT
YOU IN THE BACK,

966
01:24:55,584 --> 01:24:57,434
LIKE YOUR GUYS
DID MY BOY!

967
01:24:57,435 --> 01:24:59,469
AND THE MOMENT
MY MEN HEAR THAT SHOT,

968
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,137
- THEY'LL BE IN HERE.
- (gun clicks)

969
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,023
Violet:
TOMMY, JUST STOP
FOR A MINUTE.

970
01:25:03,024 --> 01:25:05,542
YOU KNOW, JAKE,
I'M REALLY GONNA ENJOY THIS.

971
01:25:05,543 --> 01:25:07,378
TOMMY, DON'T.

972
01:25:07,379 --> 01:25:09,012
TURN HIM IN.

973
01:25:09,013 --> 01:25:10,647
NOT A CHANCE, GUNTER.

974
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:12,466
YOU CAN'T DO THIS,
NOT THIS WAY.

975
01:25:12,467 --> 01:25:14,551
GUNTER, AMIGO,

976
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:16,319
NO MORE PREACHIN',
ALL RIGHT?

977
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,555
- NOT THIS TIME.
- THINK ABOUT IT, TOMMY.

978
01:25:18,556 --> 01:25:22,225
IF YOU SHOOT HIM IN COLD BLOOD,
YOU'RE AS BAD AS HE IS.

979
01:25:22,226 --> 01:25:24,895
- THEY SHOT TRAVIS, GUNTER.
- I KNOW, TOMMY, I KNOW.

980
01:25:24,896 --> 01:25:26,980
TURN HIM IN AND LET
THE LAW DEAL WITH HIM.

981
01:25:26,981 --> 01:25:29,867
WE NEED TO BLOW THIS
LIMEY'S BRAINS OUT.

982
01:25:29,868 --> 01:25:33,420
- PRONTO.
- TOMMY, THIS IS A TEST.

983
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:36,723
FOR TRAVIS'S SAKE,
FOR MY SAKE, FOR GLORIA

984
01:25:36,724 --> 01:25:38,825
AND FOR THE SAKE
OF ANY PEACE YOU MIGHT HAVE

985
01:25:38,826 --> 01:25:42,245
IN YOUR LAST YEARS,
PLEASE, STOP THE KILLING.

986
01:25:55,743 --> 01:25:57,511
(sighs)

987
01:25:57,512 --> 01:25:59,730
(gunshot)

988
01:26:09,657 --> 01:26:12,209
(pulse beating)

989
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:13,777
(thuds)

990
01:26:25,523 --> 01:26:28,324
(gun clicks)

991
01:26:33,365 --> 01:26:35,933
MOVE!

992
01:26:35,934 --> 01:26:38,168
Tommy:
GET HER UPSTAIRS!

993
01:26:39,954 --> 01:26:41,521
Gunter:
TOMMY!  GUNS!

994
01:26:48,496 --> 01:26:50,497

995
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:22,646
- (thuds)
- THAT'S FOR MARYELLA.

996
01:27:24,165 --> 01:27:26,667
GREAT PLAN, TOMMY.

997
01:27:26,668 --> 01:27:28,234
WELCOME TO TEXAS--
LOTS OF GUNS.

998
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:32,756

999
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,675
(screams)

1000
01:27:35,676 --> 01:27:38,194
BABY, STAY DOWN.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1001
01:27:54,879 --> 01:27:56,646
HEY!  Y'ALL HOLD ON!!

1002
01:27:57,982 --> 01:28:00,316
(screams)

1003
01:28:03,888 --> 01:28:05,973
HOW ABOUT THAT GERMAN
PACIFIST THERE, HUH?

1004
01:28:05,974 --> 01:28:07,708
GUNTER!  GET 'EM, BUD!

1005
01:28:11,229 --> 01:28:13,496
(man screams)

1006
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,999
Will:
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.
AIN'T YOU SOMETHING?

1007
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:30,914
SHOOT, THAT
WAS ONE BIG GANG.

1008
01:28:30,915 --> 01:28:33,750
- TOMMY, WATCH YOUR BACK!
THERE'S TWO COMIN'!
- (men yelling)

1009
01:28:33,751 --> 01:28:35,552
- (guns blasting)
- TOMMY HILL!

1010
01:28:35,553 --> 01:28:37,237
WHY DON'T YOU DIE?!

1011
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:49,282
(grunts, thuds)

1012
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:04,865
WHOO!

1013
01:29:07,669 --> 01:29:10,104
(cheering, laughing)

1014
01:29:10,105 --> 01:29:12,005
Violet:
WE DID IT, BOYS!

1015
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:15,109
HELLFIRE, WE DID IT!

1016
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:16,944
DAMN SURE DID!

1017
01:29:16,945 --> 01:29:18,928
Will:
WHAT YOU GONNA DO
WITH YOUR MONEY?

1018
01:29:18,929 --> 01:29:20,681
YOU GONNA
REBUILD THAT RANCH?

1019
01:29:20,682 --> 01:29:22,349
- I DON'T KNOW.
- I TELL YOU WHAT,

1020
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,184
I'M GONNA GET ME OUT
OF THIS GODFORSAKEN COUNTRY.

1021
01:29:24,185 --> 01:29:25,852
I'M GONNA TAKE ME
A BOAT STRAIGHT TO--

1022
01:29:25,853 --> 01:29:27,754
(whistles)
JAY-PAN!

1023
01:29:27,755 --> 01:29:29,590
(all laughing)

1024
01:29:29,591 --> 01:29:31,458
JESUS!

1025
01:29:31,459 --> 01:29:33,327
(sighs)

1026
01:29:34,429 --> 01:29:36,296
SHIT, IT'S COLD.

1027
01:29:38,566 --> 01:29:40,400
WILL

- Gunter: IT'S BAD, WILL.

1036
01:30:07,328 --> 01:30:09,162
I SHOULD'VE LET YOU
STAY UP FRONT THERE.

1037
01:30:11,265 --> 01:30:13,783
- (laughs, cries)
- Tommy: YOU SURE SHOULD'VE.

1038
01:30:13,784 --> 01:30:16,153
(laughing, gagging)

1039
01:30:16,154 --> 01:30:19,956
- TAKE IT EASY, WILL.

1047
01:30:38,493 --> 01:30:41,127
COULD YOU GET US A COUPLE
OF GUITARS AND DO US A SONG?

1048
01:30:41,128 --> 01:30:44,981
- Gunter: OKAY.
- WILL, BUDDY,

1049
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:46,617
WE'RE OUT OF GUITARS.

1050
01:31:01,882 --> 01:31:04,417

SUNSET SOMETHING?

1051
01:31:06,053 --> 01:31:09,405

01:31:09,406 --> 01:31:11,958
- Will: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- Violet: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1053
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:22,319

1054
01:31:24,372 --> 01:31:26,757
WILL!

1055
01:31:26,758 --> 01:31:28,675
WILL!

1056
01:31:34,215 --> 01:31:35,949
HE'S DEAD.

1057
01:31:38,385 --> 01:31:39,786
YEAH.

1058
01:31:40,821 --> 01:31:42,772
NO.

(crying)
GOOD--

1060
01:31:48,563 --> 01:31:50,797
GOODBYE, WILL.

1061
01:32:04,195 --> 01:32:07,064
MY BROTHER.

1062
01:33:04,121 --> 01:33:06,873
I'M GONNA
MISS HIM, TOMMY.

1063
01:33:07,975 --> 01:33:10,193
Tommy:
I KNOW YOU ARE.

1064
01:33:13,013 --> 01:33:15,047
I'M GONNA MISS

1065
01:33:25,826 --> 01:33:27,860
LET'S GO HOME.

1066
01:33:31,682 --> 01:33:33,433
OKAY.
