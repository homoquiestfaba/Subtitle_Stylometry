(chant fades)

381
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:09,083
NAWI:
Fumbe.

382
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:11,752
Show me how to tie the rope.

383
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:14,054
(laughs) Never.

384
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:16,725
It is the only thing
I can do better than you.

385
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:19,728
(scoffs) Ode, this one.

386
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,962
(laughter)

387
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:24,733
But did you see Izogie?

388
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,867
-(sighs)
-With the dagger here.

389
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,738
She's standing there,
not moving, not in pain.

390
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,805
-Wow.
-(chuckles) I love it.

391
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,774
I'm going to be like her.

392
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:34,875
Yes, my friend.

393
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,310
-As strong as her.
-Mm-hmm.

394
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,546
You try to stab me,
I'll stab you back.

395
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,814
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

396
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,517
IZOGIE:
Backswing.

397
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,721
(explosive pop)

398
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:49,089
(quiet laughter)

399
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:53,460
(snickering)

400
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,535
Which of you designed
this trick?

401
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:04,972
NANISCA:
Hmm?

402
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,642
-Then you will all be punished.
-I did it.

403
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:10,077
-We all did it.
-No.

404
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,647
It was me.

405
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:13,847
I apologize.

406
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:16,483
Once again.

407
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:19,953
Go back to the barracks.

408
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:28,429
How do you make this explosion?

409
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:32,833
You do not need guns
to use gunpowder.

410
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:34,968
We just need a spark.

411
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:38,472
You like the guns?

412
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:41,041
Do you enjoy practicing
with the men in the infantry?

413
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,178
I see you flirting.

414
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:46,514
-This is not allowed?
-You know it is not.

415
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,015
Why not?

416
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:50,851
The men who are soldiers
have wives and children,

417
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,721
but the Agojie cannot.

418
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,288
How is that fair?

419
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,156
Were you this arrogant
with your family?

420
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,925
No wonder they gave you away.

421
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,595
It is you who is arrogant.

422
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:03,798
I am a general.

423
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:04,998
I have earned it.

424
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:06,835
You have earned nothing.

425
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:08,102
I should put you out.

426
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,870
-No.
-I have watched soldiers die

427
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:12,106
because they did not
have discipline.

428
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,842
Their easy life
did not prepare them for

429
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:17,945
-this life here as an Agojie.
-I did not have an easy life.

430
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:22,684
(crying)
I did not have an easy life.

431
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:24,017
Please.

432
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:25,953
I-I want to be here
with the others.

433
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:28,188
I want to fight for my king.

434
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:31,959
Please.

435
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:36,463
Your tears mean nothing.

436
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:41,402
To be a warrior,
you must kill your tears.

437
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:46,373
(sniffles)

438
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:50,512
Go.

439
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:53,147
Ah.

440
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:03,457
Go.

441
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,566
Hey.

442
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,967
You are a Mahi prisoner.

443
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,904
That is all you will ever be.

444
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:18,338
What did you say?

445
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:20,875
-She killed our people.
-You killed mine.

446
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:24,011
Me, I also came here a captive.

447
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:26,881
Do you think yourself
better than me?

448
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:28,115
No, Ajahi.

449
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,585
If you make it
through the final test,

450
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:33,020
you are one of us.

451
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:36,056
No matter where you come from.

452
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,062
Hmm. (sniffs)

453
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,837
Hey, Tsetse.

454
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:49,970
Eat up.

455
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:53,240
Nanisca favors the strong.

456
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,343
What is the first rule
of training?

457
00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:01,081
(sighs)

458
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:03,651
Always obey Izogie.

459
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:09,990
Come with me.

460
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:12,459
(insects trilling)

461
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:15,630
Drink.

462
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,164
What is it?

463
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:20,067
The only thing the white men
bring worth having.

464
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,871
They call it whiskey.

465
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,271
(chuckles)

466
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:28,375
There. We finally found
a way to quiet Tse.

467
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,043
You know your tongue
will get you

468
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:32,045
kicked back to your village.

469
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,348
Why do you challenge
the miganon?

470
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:36,518
NAWI:
If I'm quiet, she won't see me.

471
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:39,219
(scoffs) Do you think she
has time to think about you?

472
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:43,123
(scoffs) She is thinking
about the world.

473
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:46,026
You know she may one day
be the kpojito.

474
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,095
-The woman king?
-Mm-hmm.

475
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:51,064
But we have not had one
in so many years.

476
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,166
His brother did not honor it,

477
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,037
but King Ghezo believes
in tradition.

478
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:01,009
In the twin gods,
Mawu and Lisa.

479
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:03,043
Woman and man.

480
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,913
Equal.

481
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,080
Ghezo will name a woman king.

482
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,984
For the gods and the people.

483
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:13,021
But is that what
the miganon wants?

484
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:15,023
I cannot say.

485
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:18,325
But in the palace,
she is a legend.

486
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,061
Captured as a young soldier.

487
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:23,063
Given up for dead.

488
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:25,265
But she returned,

489
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:30,038
with the Oyo bastards' kofes
hanging by her belt.

490
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,439
(laughing)

491
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:37,277
(grunts, gasping)

492
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:41,516
(breathing heavily)

493
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,031
NANISCA:
You know I hate that drink.

494
00:34:57,164 --> 00:35:00,034
The king drinks
anything I give him.

495
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,401
The king is young.

496
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:04,137
He brings that silly wife
to the council.

497
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,406
(chuckles) Shante.

498
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:11,345
-Ah, she is ambitious, hmm?
-(Nanisca scoffs)

499
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:17,986
(Amenza takes deep breath)

500
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,187
(Nanisca grunts)

501
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,155
Tell me the dream, Nani.

502
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,592
(Nanisca clicks tongue, groans)

503
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:29,797
It dispels its magic
if you say the words.

504
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,069
I am in the jungle.

505
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:37,270
AMENZA:
Mm-hmm.

506
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:43,210
Something is out there,
in the darkness.

507
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:46,047
A beast.

508
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:48,415
Angry.

509
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:53,153
(Nanisca sighs)

510
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:55,556
I can smell its sweat,
its fear.

511
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,693
What does the beast look like?

512
00:35:59,861 --> 00:36:01,395
I don't know.

513
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:04,297
That is when I wake.

514
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,935
The dream is a warning, no?

515
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,204
We must ask Legba.

516
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,340
Oh, no. Not the nuts.

517
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:16,110
(scoffs) Do not call them nuts.

518
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:18,112
(Nanisca chuckling)

519
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:20,180
They are sacred.

520
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,159
You have enemies gathering.

521
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,894
You must do better than that.

522
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:38,599
I see fire.

523
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:44,172
Something or someone
from your past.

524
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:47,075
(sighs) This is nonsense.

525
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,543
And your medicine, too.

526
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:52,212
-I am not even tired.
-Go to the altar.

527
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:55,449
Leave gifts for the dead.

528
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:59,887
Do it.

529
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:04,726

respect your own dream.

00:55:12,345 --> 00:55:13,981
And white...

738
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:16,617
(chuckles) but not.

739
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:22,089
You think I could
have my pants now?

740
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:30,330
I saw you in Ouidah.

741
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:32,365
Why are you here in the jungle?

742
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,303
I am going to Dahomey.

743
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:38,940
The place my mother told me
so much about.

744
00:55:39,073 --> 00:55:42,375
Perhaps I will
see you there, too.

745
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:45,345
If you are allowed
into the palace.

746
00:56:10,504 --> 00:56:12,573
I am Malik.

747
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:15,408
SANTO:
Malik!

748
00:56:18,713 --> 00:56:20,447

(indistinct chatter, laughter)

751
00:56:34,028 --> 00:56:37,231
I do not like
this young captain.

752
00:56:37,365 --> 00:56:39,333
Puffed up like a banty rooster.

753
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:40,601
Finally, we agree.

754
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:42,069

GHEZO:
So you are now a captain, eh?

757
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:56,684
<i>-Si.</i>
-Very good.

758
00:56:56,817 --> 00:56:58,653

759
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:03,791
GHEZO:
Well done.

760
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:13,034
You have my thanks.

761
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:26,347
My mother was also taken.

762
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:28,749
Sold by my brother.

763
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:31,319
I have many men in your country
searching for her,

764
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,387
and they will bring her back.

765
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:35,122
It is a must. (chuckles)

766
00:57:35,256 --> 00:57:38,359
And, uh, if they find
your mother,

767
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:40,394
they will bring her back, too.

768
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:42,196
I have just buried her.

769
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,633
It was her dying wish
that I come to her home.

770
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:47,969
The only place
she was ever free.

771
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,272
This is your home.

772
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:53,407
It is yours, eh?

773
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,210
And you came on the right day.

774
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:57,645
Our magnificent Agojie,

775
00:57:57,778 --> 00:57:59,479
they are doing
their final test.

776
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:01,515
So please sit, eh?

777
00:58:01,649 --> 00:58:03,483
Go. Go on, sit. Go.

778
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:06,020
Prepare the seats for them.

779
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,891
Very good.

780
00:58:11,592 --> 00:58:13,027

Face it head-on.

786

palm oil.

prosper

923

as anything but a commodity.

a necessity to me,

Miganon, Ajahi.

1306

The king requests you.

1307
01:36:23,484 --> 01:36:27,187
I have brought you here
because I have chosen kpojito.

1308
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:30,257
Kpojito is beloved
of the people.

1309
01:36:30,391 --> 01:36:34,261
She must be deserving of their
admiration and their trust.

1310

We must share the same vision
for our future.

1311
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:40,067
A bold future.

1312
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,805
For that reason,
I have chosen Nanisca.

1313
01:36:48,942 --> 01:36:50,377
She is a common soldier.

1314

Go, go, go.

to the palace,

1319

1320

Go and prepare.

1321

INIYA:
Well done.

1322
01:37:32,019 --> 01:37:34,988
My king, it is a great honor.

1323
01:37:35,122 --> 01:37:37,257
But perhaps it is too soon,

1324
01:37:37,391 --> 01:37:39,126

so many soldiers

1325
01:37:39,259 --> 01:37:40,861

1326
01:37:40,994 --> 01:37:42,863

1327
01:37:42,996 --> 01:37:43,864
No one is grieving.

1328
01:37:43,997 --> 01:37:45,132
We have won.

1329
01:37:45,265 --> 01:37:46,900
We have thrown off the yoke.

1330
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:48,902
My king, I wish to seek
our lost Agojie.

1331
01:37:49,036 --> 01:37:50,137
Some were taken captive.

1332
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:51,505
They will be sold,
used by the men.

1333
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:54,542
Nanisca, the moment
you seek is here.

1334
01:37:54,676 --> 01:37:56,578
The few have been sacrificed
for the many.

1335
01:37:56,711 --> 01:37:59,581
-Now we must move forward.
-I can go alone. Let me try.

1336

-The Oyo...
-You disobey me, Nanisca.

1337

Are you confusing
my admiration for weakness?

1338
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:09,323
I am your king.

1339
01:38:09,456 --> 01:38:13,894
Let me tell you, you will not
seek out those captives.

1340
01:38:14,027 --> 01:38:15,996
You must stay by my side

1341
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:18,899

I bestow you.
