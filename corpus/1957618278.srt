[male narrator] 
I cannot believe that life 
can be more generous

6
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:31,787
than it was to me 
when I was a young writer

7
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:36,705
living in New York City and in love with a girl named Janet.

[typewriter keys clacking]

9
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:39,969
Janet was from Iowa.

10
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:42,928
Now an editor 
at a fashion magazine.

11
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:45,279
She was convinced that 
when I was working

12
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,715
I'd forget to eat.

13
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,151
[doorbell rings]

14
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,601
- Is that you?
- It's me.

[knock on door]

16
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:36,460
I bought you corn beef
on rye with potato salad.

17
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,767
You said you'd rather have
potato salad than coleslaw.

18
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,335
- Thank you.
- I thought I'd never get a cab.

19
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,119
There's a slight mist
falling out there.

20
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,426
- You know how it gets.
- Mmm, yes, I know.

21
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,471
Oh, Aunt Flo invited us
to tea tomorrow.

22
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,647
Okay.

23
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,475
Why is it so dark
in here?

24
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:52,911
Janet.

25
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,001
Sit down.

26
00:02:56,088 --> 00:03:00,049
John, I'm on a deadline tonight.
I gotta get back to the office.

27
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,793
Oh.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,317
You really are an odd person
even for a writer.

29
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,756
[slow music]

30
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:15,456
Thank you for
the corn beef on rye.

31
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:18,937
Thank you for remembering
the potato salad.

32
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:20,983
And thank you for coming
into my life.

33
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,028
You're welcome.

34
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:25,596
I never thought
I'd get married.

35
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,860
I used to think my work was
so important and so demanding

36
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:32,342
that it could take the place
of a wife and a family.

37
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,304
That night you walked
into the Algonquin for dinner.

38
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,048
I turned to the people
I was with and I said..

39
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,748
...that's the woman
I'm gonna marry.

40
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:50,099
You're awfully sure of yourself,
aren't you, Mr. Walton?

41
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:59,587
Janet, you proposed to me
back on Walton's Mountain

42
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,199
but I never really
proposed to you.

43
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:09,858
I love you, Janet,
and I'm asking you to marry me.

44
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,732
I'd like that
very much, John-Boy.

45
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:25,177
Why don't you
call me John?

46

[keys clacking]

48
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:54,468
Corabeth, I think we're gonna
have to buy a new cash register.

49
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,299
Corabeth, I said I think

50
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:02,737
we're gonna have to
buy a new cash register.

51
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:05,827
And I think we're gonna
have to also buy a hearing aid

52
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:08,612
to stick in your ear
so I won't have to yell!

53
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,788
For God's sake, please.

54
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,269
I am in the throes
of creation.

55
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,053
Now, what on Earth
is it now?

56
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,838
I was trying to
get your attention.

57
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:17,969
How's the book coming?

58
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:21,408
Mr. Godsey,
I am inspired.

59
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,453
The news of
John-Boy's wedding

60
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,240
has positively
energized my muse.

[bell rings]

62
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,680
Oh, good morning,
Mr. Godsey.

63
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,464
'Well, good morning, ladies.'

64
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:38,816
Good morning, Ike.
And how are you, Corabeth?

65
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,514
Well, you'll have
to forgive, Corabeth.

66
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,777
She sent away for one of those
correspondence courses

67
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,040
that teaches you how
to write a romance novel.

68
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:47,608
Oh.

69
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,871
'So, what can I do
for you, ladies?'

70
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,264
Well, we need just
oodles of sugar.

71
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,484
Uh, how many,
Miss Emily?

72
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,225
How many, what?

73
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,140
How many oodles?

74
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,447
Oh, several.

75
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:03,014
- Wouldn't you say, sister?
- Oh, indeed, yes.

76
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:06,148
And we also need some yeast.
The kind we usually order.

77
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,106
Ah, something tells me

78
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,674
you ladies are mixing up
a batch of the recipe.

79
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:14,417
We're making a special run
for John-Boy's wedding.

80
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:18,769
We are personally transporting
the recipe to New York

81
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,771
and to John-Boy
and his friend.

82
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,643
Sister's already
started practicing

83
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,386
driving the automobile
and I'm going to navigate.

84
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,344
Well, it isn't all
that difficult.

85
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,435
One simply gets out
to Route 29 and heads north.

86
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:35,525
Sister, you remember the time
we drove to New York with papa?

87
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,309
Was that the time
we were stopped

88
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,355
by the law enforcement
officers, sister?

89
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,401
'Remember papa gave him
some of the recipe'

90
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,447
and he tore up
the speeding ticket?

91
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,493
I have no recollection
of that, sister.

92
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,320
Oh.

93
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,148
[Mamie]
'That will be all,
Mr. Godsey.'

94
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,803
Well, fine. I'll send that
all over this afternoon.

95
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,719
And how will you ladies
be taking care of the bill?

96
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:59,027
We had a notice from the bank
that we've run out of money

97
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,290
and so I'll have
to mail you a check.

98
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:07,383
Well, that'll be fine.
Isn't that right, Corabeth?

99
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,692
- Bye bye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Godsey.

to say, save

[dog barking]

110
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,898
- Morning, Drew.
- Good morning, John.

111
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,813
Thought you fellas
might want some coffee.

112
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,119
You've been out here
since the crack of dawn.

113
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,818
Well, we have another
big order to get out.

114
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,951
You and Drew have done
a good job running the mill.

115
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:58,521
Now that the election's over,
I'll be able to help out again.

116
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,523
It'll be good to have
you back, daddy.

117
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,177
Yeah, it sure will.

118
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:04,919
Especially with this big
contract we got coming up.

119
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,835
- You tell your dad yet?
- Madison Development.

120
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,576
They're planning to build
a big subdivision

121
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,273
here in Jefferson County.

122
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,971
I talked them into getting
all their lumber from us.

123
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,757
I wish you'd talked that over
with me first, Ben.

124
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,542
I'm not sure we can handle
a big order like that.

125
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,066
Don't know if we have
the tools or the manpower.

126
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,025
Manpower is
no problem, Johners.

127
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:26,506
Men all over the county
looking for work.

128
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,856
You know that new mill
that folded in Rockfish?

129
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,901
I got a great price
on their equipment.

130
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,686
I bought out
the whole place.

131
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,992
So how you figurin'
on paying for it?

132
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,864
We've made a down payment.

133
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,692
They're gonna take
a percentage of profits

134
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,042
from Madison until they're paid.
It's foolproof.

135
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,261
I don't know how
you figured that.

136
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:45,916
The county's gotta vote
on this development first.

137
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:48,005
It's good for the county,
it'll go through.

138
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:49,877
Besides, you're on
the board of supervisors.

139
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:53,010
I hope I'm hearing
you wrong, son.

140
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,970
If it's good for the county,
I'll probably vote for it.

141
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:59,930
But we can't stake our
business on how I vote.

142
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,932
No, you better
get on the phone

143
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,934
and cancel all
that fancy equipment.

144
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:07,329
I can't do that.
We're locked into it.

145
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,200
Look, it's a good deal, John.

146
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:12,813
I knew when I put you in charge
you were gonna take some risks.

147
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,380
I didn't think you'd
put us out like this.

148
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,688
- Daddy, it's a sure thing.
- Didn't I teach you anything?

149
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:24,433
This business is built
on common sense and hard work.

150
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,740
There's no such thing
as a sure thing.

151
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,133
Get the paperwork
on this deal, now.

152
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,613
Bring it inside.

153
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:36,445
Well, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

154
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,142
John.

155
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:39,970
Hello.

156
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,190
Janet tells me
you're from Virginia.

157
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,192
That's right.
My family's been living

158
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,760
up in the Blue Ridge Mountain
since the early 1700s.

159
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,632
Well, one of my very best
husbands came from Virginia.

160
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,286
I just adore Virginians.

161
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,723
Well, I'll take that
as a recommendation.

162
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,291
Now, I probably will become

163
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,902
a pain in the neck
as time goes by.

164
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:01,339
Janet is the daughter
I never had.

165
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:04,125
She comes from a distinguished
family as, of course, you know.

166
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,779
Please sit.

167
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:09,043
And since her mother is not here
to arrange things for her

168
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,522
I have to do it.

169
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,482
Well, all we want, Aunt Flo,
is your moral support.

170
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,659
Oh, my dear.
Of course, you have that.

171
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,748
That's all, Dean.
Thank you.

172
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:21,533
It's just that until your mother
and father actually get here

173
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,188
I really feel I have
to stand in their place.

174
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:27,191
Uh, we thought we'd just arrange
the wedding ourselves.

175
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,412
Of course,
you can and will.

176
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,937
All I'm offering
are suggestions. Shortcuts.

177
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:36,636
After all, I have been married
a number of times.

178
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,594
[laughing]

179
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,944
[Aunt Flo]
'Introductions to
the right service people.

180
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:44,818
Caterers, engravers, florists.
I got a wonderful florist.

181
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:48,822
And some assurances
that good taste be observed.

182
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,347
Do we have a problem
with good taste?

183
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:58,440
Obviously not,
my dear young man.

184
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,617
I mean, look who
you've chosen to marry.

185
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,664
'No, it's-it's just that'

186
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,841
I feel an extra
responsibility since..

187
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:12,019
Darling...it looks
like your father

188
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:15,849
is going to have
some difficulty getting here.

189
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:18,634
- If he does get here at all.
- Oh, no.

190
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:22,290
Well, they're having
civil unrest down there

191
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,553
or whatever it is they're
calling revolution these days.

192
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,337
I finally did get
a telephone call

193
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,731
through to your poor
dear mother and she said

194
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:31,691
that under the circumstances,
perhaps it would be best for me

195
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:34,084
to stand in for her.

196
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:37,697
'Make any decisions
she might make.'

197
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,916
Um, I wonder if you saw

198
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:43,572
the wedding has been mentioned
in Walter Winchell's column.

199
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:46,227
Actually, Aunt Flo, we're
planning a small wedding

200
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,011
at the little church
around the corner

201
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:50,013
with just our family
and some friends.

202
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,146
And some neighbors
from Walton's Mountain.

203
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,540
Well, u-uh..

204
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:59,153
Darling.

205
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,459
What about your
father's associates

206
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,984
in the diplomatic corps?

207
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:07,291
What will they think
if I allow you to get married

208
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,641
in that dowdy
little church?

209
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,515
St. Bartholomew's would be
so much more appropriate.

210
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,604
You could play
the World Series in there.

211
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,911
[laughing]
Yes, you could.

212
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,782
Aunt Flo, we appreciate
your concern

213
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,742
but we really do wanna
keep it simple.

214
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,484
Children, I know it seems
like an awful lot to go through

215
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:29,357
but after all it is
these rituals

216
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,533
that separate us
from the savages.

217
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,101
Maybe we should
think about it, John.

218
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,930
We have thought about it.
We've talked about it for hours.

219
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:38,670
We've invited people.
We've reserved the church.

220
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,890
Oh, that.

221
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:44,589
Oh, darling.
Not to worry.

222
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,896
All that can be arranged.

223
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:49,856
Just leave everything to me.

224
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,035
Saturday Evening Post.

225
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:58,081
John, I want you to know
there's some good stuff in here

226
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:00,257
and there's some stuff
that's not so good.

227
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,607
I know. I'm not satisfied
with it either.

228
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,696
- What's the problem?
- I wish I knew.

229
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,960
My own grandmother.
I've known her all my life.

230
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,788
I can't get her down
on paper.

231
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,877
I like her relationship
with the grandfather.

232
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,617
Oh, they worship
each other.

233
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:15,620
And her determination
to keep going after the stroke.

234
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,928
[John]
Grandma's always been
a real fighter.

235
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,452
It has the makings
of exactly the kind of article

236
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,193
I'm looking for, John.

237
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,369
But it has no depth.

238
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,154
May be we should
get some background

239
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,851
on her family history.

240
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,897
Where does all
that grit come from?

241
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,987
Sybil, I'm gonna need more time
than you've given me for this.

242
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:35,989
I'd love to, John,
but my deadline's firm.

243
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,121
There's no way
to change it now.

244
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,081
Okay, okay, don't worry
about it. I'll get it done.

245
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,605
I wonder if this isn't
a case where we've taken

246
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,215
the boy out of the country

247
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:47,957
and the country out of
the boy at the same time.

248
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,350
It's possible.

249
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,395
It's hard not to get
a citified veneer

250
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:53,963
when you've been living
in New York for a while.

251
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,270
Maybe you might find this
article easier to write

252
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:59,316
if you went back to that
mountain of yours for a visit.

253
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,144
That could be.

254
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,843
I suspect, John. You need
to go back to the well.

255
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,021
'Spend some time
with your grandmother.'

256
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,414
Get in touch with your
original inspiration.

257
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,158
Well, I'm always looking
for an excuse to go back home.

258
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,986
You've got one.

259
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,468
Maybe.

260
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,298
[knocking]

261
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,082
[John]
'It's me.'

262
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,350
Hi. Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't make dinner.

263
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,831
I-I tried to reach you
but your line's been busy.

264
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,702
I took the phone
off the hook.

265
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,269
Your Aunt Flo
called to suggest

266
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,054
the Sherry Netherland
for the reception.

267
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:44,100
She gets that way when she's
in the middle of a project.

268
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,189
Call her off, Janet.
She's driving me crazy.

269
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,496
- I've got a deadline.
- She's only trying to help.

270
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,542
Mother would take care of these
things, but we can't reach her.

271
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,153
The phone lines are down.

272
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,633
She's not your mother, and she's
taking over our wedding.

273
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,683
Let's not fight.
We're both tired.

274
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,557
Maybe you should go back
to Walton's Mountain

275
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:07,907
to finish your article.

276
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,909
You're the second person
who's told me that.

277
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,736
Everybody wants me
out of the way.

278
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:15,566
I just don't want us
to be at each other's throats.

279
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,699
Not now.

280
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,527
Not before the wedding.

281
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,617
How can I go anywhere
when you look at me like that?

282
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,587
[Aunt Flo]
'Hello. Hello.

283
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,807
Somebody left the door open.

284
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:42,289
Oh, John. How lucky
to find you here too.

285
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,117
Aunt Flo, what are
you doing here?

286
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,249
I've just come from
a perfectly marvelous party

287
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,730
and you'll never guess
who's back in town.

288
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:51,733
David Drucker.
He was over in Monaco.

289
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,041
He was doing one of his charity
balls for the Grimaldis.

290
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:57,391
He built
the whole affair

291
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,262
on a Scottish
Highland theme.

292
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,438
He's mad,
he's just completely mad.

293
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,527
Anyway, when I told him
about you children

294
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:06,704
'he insisted on seeing you
and giving you some ideas.'

295
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,185
Oh, Aunt Flo. You know
we're both terribly busy.

296
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:12,406
Oh, I know. I said they couldn't
take more than a minute.

297
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,974
But you see once we have
the plan settled on

298
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,759
you can just leave
it to me to carry it out.

299
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,543
We need to talk
about this.

300
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,503
John, I couldn't possibly
wiggle out of this.

301
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,332
I mean, he's offering
his services as a favor to me.

302
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,203
And you're gonna
to love his ideas.

303
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,338
You know, for this Scottish
thing, he had a regiment.

304
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:35,907
I mean an entire regiment.
A regiment of bagpipers.

305
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,824
And he served
stuffed Scottish grouse.

306
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,001
You ever had stuffed
Scottish grouse?

307
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,959
Actually, I like them.

308
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,222
They nest in the woods
outside our house.

309
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:49,704
My dad used to go in the morning
and shoot 'em for breakfast.

310
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,315
In fact, they taste
absolutely delicious

311
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:55,405
if you fry them with a mess
of biscuits and brown gravy.

312
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:59,148
You know, you're right. I'll be
back home on Walton's Mountain.

313
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:00,802
[door opens and closes]

314
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,891
Oh, my dear.

315
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:06,112
I hope I didn't
offend him.

316
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,767
I mean, it doesn't have
to be grouse.

317
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,034
Pheasant would do perfectly.

318
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,256
[owl hooting]

319
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:36,925
[door closing]

320
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,883
'Evening, Liv.'

321
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:47,501
- Evening.
- Is that anyone I know?

322
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:53,681
"Feminine Mystique."
What's that?

323
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:57,250
Some kind of romantic novel
that Corabeth gave you?

324
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:59,078
Not exactly.

325
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,950
- Has ma gone to bed?
- An hour ago.

326
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,170
Kept your supper
warm for you.

327
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,781
Yeah.
The meeting ran overtime.

328
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:10,611
The sky is changing so fast,
it's hard to keep up.

329
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:14,049
If I'd known this supervisor's
job was gonna take so much time

330
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,138
I never would have
run for office.

331
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:19,924
When those voters find out
how smart you are..

332
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,013
...they're gonna want you
to run for governor.

333
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,277
How'd you like to be
First Lady of Virginia?

334
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:25,408
[Olivia chuckling]

335
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:27,106
I'd rather go back to school.

336
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,764
- Seriously.
- You unhappy, Liv?

337
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,596
Sometimes when I'm here
in the house by myself

338
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:42,295
with nothing to do
and nobody to look after

339
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:46,168
I start wondering
what I'm good for.

340
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:49,780
Is something in this book
bothering you?

341
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,348
I'll tell you something
if you promise you won't laugh.

342
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:55,525
The other morning,
I found myself looking at you

343
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,441
and wondering
who is that stranger?

344
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,053
Did you ever look
at me like that?

345
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,795
I can't say as I have.

346
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:07,972
Guess I just need to get
to know myself a little better.

347
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,627
Find out where I fit
in the world.

348
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,978
There is so much I wanna know
and so much I don't know.

349
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:17,199
If it's that
important to you, Liv

350
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:20,246
maybe you ought
to go back to school.

351
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,770
You might like living
with a co-ed.

352
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,337
I think you'd look nice

353
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,904
in saddle shoes
and a tight sweater.

354
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:29,472
I'll see about dessert.

355
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,346
The only dessert
I want is you.

356
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:36,131
Now, let's see, um...what'd
you say your name was?

357
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,918
This conversation
is not over.

358
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,403
And then the husband says

359
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,971
"Well, what do you expect
after 50 years of marriage."

360
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,191
[laughing]

361
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,672
Anybody for seconds?

362
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,892
- Oh, me. Me, me.
- Mmm, not you.

363
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,154
Why not?

364
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,938
Because you've put on
too much weight.

365
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:04,028
- Even for your ninth month.
- Yes, doctor.

366
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,856
But you can help me
to seconds.

367
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,118
Me too.

368
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,598
You've decided
on a name?

369
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:12,733
Yes. If it's a girl,
Patsy Cline Walton.

370
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,214
- And if it's a boy?
- Elvis.

371
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,606
Of course.

372
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,826
- Hi, mama.
- Hi.

373
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:20,871
Mother and baby
are doing fine.

374
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,222
Took all three of you
to figure that out?

375
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,745
We're here to help.

376
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,790
Elizabeth, I think you'd better
pay close attention

377
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:30,229
because I've seen a gleam
in Drew's eye lately.

378
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:32,231
No, I'm not gonna
have any children yet.

379
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,884
I'm going back to school.

380
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:36,235
There's no reason
you can't do both.

381
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,063
I just signed up for a class
at Boatwright College.

382
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,457
- 'American Studies.'
- Mama, that's great.

383
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:42,850
My mother the freshman.

384
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:45,722
I don't mind telling you
I'm scared to death.

385
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,247
This mean I'm gonna have
to find a new babysitter?

386
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,118
I'll always be there
for my grandchildren.

387
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:52,903
And that includes you.

388
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,298
You be sure and let me know
the minute it's on its way.

389
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:57,647
You got it.

390
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,084
Better call me first
if I'm gonna deliver it.

391
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:01,651
Toni, that baby
better hurry up

392
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,697
or you're not gonna
make John-Boy's wedding.

393
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,743
Actually, I plan to have it
during the ceremony.

394
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,790
[laughing]

395
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,400
[Toni]
I'm not missing the wedding.

396
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:16,013
Brides are getting more
beautiful every day.

397
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,278
I would suggest that we get
Halsman to photograph you.

398
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:22,193
Well, I've already arranged
a photographer from my magazine.

399
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,065
He's done shoots
for me before.

400
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:26,154
I'll phone his agent
later today.

401
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:29,026
Flo, now what have you
come up with so far?

402
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:31,638
St. Bartholomew's Cathedral.

403
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,248
- An evening ceremony, I think.
- Mm-hmm?

404
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:36,077
Well, actually, we were planning
on a morning ceremony.

405
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:39,210
Wonderful.
Morning coats, top hats.

406
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,039
I've always wanted to do
a wedding with the bridal party

407
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,303
arriving in a carriage.

408
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,827
I don't think John's family
will go for morning coats.

409
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:49,395
They're country people
from Virginia.

410
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:52,615
The Virginians I know
are the tweedy types.

411
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:55,749
Fox hunters.
Horses. Hounds.

412
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,708
Actually, they are
mountain people.

413
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:01,363
Ah, I don't do moonshine.

414
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,973
[laughing]

415
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,149
You don't have to.

416
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,022
Two old ladies from the mountain
are bringing enough for all.

417
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,287
We'd better come up
with another idea, David.

418
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,028
Alright.
Alright.

419
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:18,337
Ah, I'm thinking
of white lace.

420
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,295
A sea of candles.

421
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,037
Aunt Flo, that's not
what we have in mind at all.

422
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:24,560
String quartet.

423
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:27,041
Not quite right, David.

424
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,043
A thousand Cymbidium orchids

425
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,393
which I'll have flown
in from Hawaii, of course.

426
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,352
[bell tolling]

427
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,286
[female #2]
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am.

428
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,811
Could you tell me which way
to the Science Building?

429
00:22:57,898 --> 00:23:00,379
I'm sorry, I'm lost too,
if I don't hurry up

430
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:03,425
and figure out where I'm going,
I'm gonna be late for class.

431
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:04,644
What do you teach?

432
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:07,168
I'm not a teacher here.
I'm a student.

433
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,692
Oh, I wish my mama would
come back to school.

434
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,957
She's not even
as o...old as you.

435
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:16,264
Is that what I look like?
An old mother.

436
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:18,527
Oh, well, you don't
look old or anything.

437
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:21,051
But you don't look
like a regular student.

438
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:23,924
I-I mean, look,
I'm sorry, ma'am.

439
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,405
[chuckling]

440
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:29,669
Little twit.

441
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:31,714
[male #1]
And it will include a unit

442
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,847
on contemporary
political movements.

443
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,938
'Are there any questions?'

444
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:40,462
Mmm. Surprise, surprise.

445
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,813
Class dismissed.

446
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,773
Uh, Mrs. Walton, I'd like
to see you for a moment.

447
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,785
You want to speak to me?

448
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:02,745
I-I was curious as to why
you signed up for this class.

449
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,923
I wanted to know more
about our country.

450
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,098
Mm-hmm.

451
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,449
What makes it work?
How it works?

452
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,407
Sometimes, how
it doesn't work?

453
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,541
I thought this would be
a good place to start.

454
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,020
To start what?

455
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,937
Back to school.

456
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm hoping to take more
classes next semester.

457
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:26,595
Maybe get my degree eventually.

458
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:31,252
Female students your age
are generally isolated

459
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,993
from the student population.

460
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,169
They find studying difficult

461
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:38,389
and they miss assignments
when their children get sick

462
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,262
and very often
they end up

463
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:44,308
failing
or dropping out.

464
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,136
Well, I don't intend
to do either.

465
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:50,271
Well, all the same, I'm not sure
you belong in this class.

466
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:53,361
Have you considered
taking, uh..

467
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:55,755
...home economics?

468
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,844
Professor Trumbull, I could
teach home economics

469
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,628
with what I've learned
raising seven children

470
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,761
and being married
half my life.

471
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:04,198
I could also teach nursing,
bookkeeping, psychology

472
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,417
first aid, carpentry,
and gardening.

473
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,290
I can shovel snow,
I can deal with a leaky faucet

474
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,771
dead car battery
and a leaky roof.

475
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,077
What I cannot deal with
is human ignorance.

476
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:18,342
Well..

477
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,867
...this is certainly going
to be an interesting semester.

478
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,479
[birds chirping]

479
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:34,794
Carry your books?

480
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,970
Oh, John-Boy,
what a nice surprise.

481
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:40,364
I am so proud of you going to
college. I can't believe it.

482
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,671
If I'd known how hard
it was gonna be

483
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,934
I might've thought twice.
What are you doing here?

484
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,633
I came home to finish
writing an article.

485
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,286
[laughing]

486
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,550
The minute we heard you were
writing about grandma

487
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,638
we rushed to help.

488
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:53,943
No. Nothing's changed.

489
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,250
They still won't let me
get any work done.

490
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:58,078
Don't forget the time
that grandpa

491
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:00,820
got thrown out of the hospital
when grandma had her stroke.

492
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,561
That was something else.

493
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:06,303
Or the time she found the jar of
a recipe in grandpa's toolbox.

494
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,350
[Bob]
She didn't speak to him
for a whole month after that.

495
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,395
Keep that up, and grandma
won't let John-Boy

496
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,789
write an article
about her at all.

497
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,618
How do you like the idea
of being a celebrity, ma?

498
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,664
Come on.

499
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,057
Well, grandma. Maybe they'll
put you on the cover.

Come in.

- Still up, son?
- 'Yeah.'

00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,705
You know, I've been thinking.

512
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,707
That old cabin
over by Drucilla's Pond?

513
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:02,969
Yeah?

514
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,840
That'd be a quiet
place for you.

515
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:08,148
That is a great idea. I'll take
my stuff over in the morning.

516
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:10,411
What you got there,
the old family Bible?

517
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,108
Yeah, I've been studying it

518
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:15,590
looking at the births, deaths,
weddings, baptisms.

519
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,157
The whole family's here.

520
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:20,029
Except I can't find a single
entry for grandma's daddy.

521
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:22,858
You won't find him
in here either.

522
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:24,599
I won't? Why not?

523
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,951
Grandma has her reasons.

524
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:31,258
She might not like you
stirring things up either.

525
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:34,827
Don't work too late, son.

526
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:37,438
I won't.

527
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:39,266
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

528
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,662
[slow music]

529
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:48,144
[insects chirping]

530
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,326
[yawning]

531
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:01,462
Ah, I keep reading the same
sentence over and over again.

532
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,682
I think my brain's
stopped working.

533
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,335
Same here.

534
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:08,121
No matter how many times
I add up these bills

535
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,600
I just can't figure out

536
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,299
how we're gonna pay
for all that equipment.

537
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:14,867
I knew I should've kept
a closer eye on Ben.

538
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:17,783
You couldn't be
in two places at once.

539
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,221
Runnin' the mill
and the campaign, both.

540
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:24,267
For once, I thought
our money problems was over.

541
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:25,747
I could wring his neck.

542
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,228
Ben thought he was
doin' the right thing.

543
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:32,101
On top of everything else
is John-Boy's wedding.

544
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:36,715
There's new clothes, trip
to New York, hotel rooms.

545
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:39,065
There's that rehearsal dinner
we're supposed to put on.

546
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:41,067
I suppose that'll mean
a fancy restaurant.

547
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,896
This whole thing could cost us
over a thousand dollars.

548
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:48,465
Oh, oh.

549
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,600
If that subdivision goes
through, won't that help?

550
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:55,864
That's what puts me
in a bind, Liv.

551
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,910
If I vote
for the subdivision

552
00:28:57,997 --> 00:29:00,608
it looks like I'm featherin'
my own nest.

553
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:04,481
If I vote against it,
we're gonna lose a lot of money.

554
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,266
[slow music]

555
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,016
[birds chirping]

556
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,585
Thank the Lord
some things don't change.

557
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,501
[John]
Sparrows still nest
in the eaves.

558
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:26,460
Fish still bite
in the pond.

559
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:28,723
There's that canoe
I used to paddle around in.

560
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,333
[John]
Yeah.

561
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,423
We bring it in each winter,
patch her up in the spring.

562
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,991
I give your mama a ride
when the weather warms.

563
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:39,081
Hope Janet and I are gonna be
happy as you and mama.

564
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:42,215
I don't wanna pry but everything
alright between you and Janet?

565
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:44,086
You showed up
kinda sudden.

566
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:46,393
She's got an aunt
that's takin' over the wedding

567
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,482
and I had to get
out of there.

568
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:51,572
Before marrying, you ever wonder
you were doing the right thing?

569
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,357
I don't know a man
who didn't get the jitters.

570
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:57,708
I've been single so long, I got
my own way of doin' things.

571
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,449
Closer it gets,
I start wondering

572
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:01,800
if I'm gonna be able
to change my ways.

573
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,584
She's probably wonderin'
the same thing.

574
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:04,933
What?

575
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,936
How would you feel
if she changed her mind?

576
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:09,329
That'll about kill me.

577
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:10,504
There's your answer.

578
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:16,118
You know, if you love
each other enough

579
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:20,383
all the doubt in the world won't
keep you from being together.

580
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,910
Daddy, it would mean a lot to me
if you'd be my best man.

581
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:27,347
Oh, son, you got
brothers for that.

582
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,915
Oh, I can't
play favorites.

583
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:34,049
Come to think of it, I probably
am the best man in your life.

584
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:37,531
[chuckles]
Are you saying yes?

585
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,839
John-Boy, I'd be honored.

586
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,319
You holler
if you need anything.

587
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,321
Thank you, daddy.

588
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:47,976
- Now, this one.
- Yes.

589
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:49,935
Perfect for the men.
Absolutely perfect.

590
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,371
[doorbell chimes]

591
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,634
- 'What about the ladies?'
- 'Well, no.'

592
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,463
'I can always depend
on your taste.

593
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,769
'You don't mean that.
I can tell you're lying.'

594
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,684
What is it?
What's wrong?

595
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:04,427
Oh, everything is fine, dear.
Why do you ask?

596
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:07,474
I was in a meeting and my
secretary brought in a message

597
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:10,042
that said that you
had to see me at once.

598
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:13,697
Darling, I'm sorry,
but we had to consult with you.

599
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,482
David has come up
with an idea

600
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:17,876
that will appeal to you
and your young man.

601
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:22,445
Ready?

602
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:25,535
A folk wedding.

603
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:27,711
We'll rent a ballroom
at the Waldorf

604
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:29,931
and decorate it
like a barn.

605
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:33,021
'Shocks of corn.
Bales of hay.'

606
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:35,328
'Pumpkins and
pomegranates, etc.'

607
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:38,113
We'll bring up a country
band from Nashville

608
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,333
and some dancers.

609
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,597
Now, I have already
spoken with Agnes.

610
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:47,688
And she is going to choreograph
some special folk dances.

611
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:50,734
And Rudi says
he'll be the caller.

612
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,302
Everybody will be
able to wear overalls

613
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:54,869
and plaid shirts--

614
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,088
I hate it.

615
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:00,135
- I beg your pardon.
- I hate it.

616
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,616
Oh..

617
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:05,401
We were so sure that this
time we'd gotten it right.

618
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:08,013
Aunt Flo, I don't want
a hillbilly wedding.

619
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,189
I don't want a ballroom
at the Warldorf

620
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:13,366
nor do I want my guests wearing
overalls and plaid shirts.

621
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:16,586
And I do not want Rudolph
Nureyuv calling the dances.

622
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:19,415
At this point, I'm thinking
of not getting married at all.

623
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,504
Maybe I'll just
live in sin.

624
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,854
No, darling.
I don't recommend it.

625
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,595
Now, not to worry.

626
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:28,381
David and I will come up
with an idea that's suitable

627
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:29,904
for the daughter
of an ambassador.

628
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:33,777
Aunt Flo..

629
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,344
...I love you.

630
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:37,607
David, I-I know
you mean well

631
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,870
but this is not another
of your charity balls.

632
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,524
This is my wedding.

633
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:43,526
This is mywedding.

634
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,093
And I'm taking it back.

635
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,925
[door opens and closes]

636
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,018
So, you need anything else,
John-Boy?

637
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,020
No, thanks, Ike.
That's about it.

638
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:02,110
John-Boy, you may have heard
that I too am pursuing

639
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,546
the literary muse.

640
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,374
Oh, well, I wish you luck,
Corabeth.

641
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:08,682
Perhaps you'd be willing to read
a chapter or two of my novel.

642
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:12,773
As a favor, you might say,
from one wordsmith to the other.

643
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,211
I'd love to, but now is not
a good time 'cause I'm working.

644
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:18,735
Oh, I understand
that perfectly.

645
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:23,523
- Tomorrow perhaps?
- We'll talk about it sometime.

646
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,786
It's good to see you, Corabeth.
Take care, Ike.

647
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,005
See ya, John-Boy.

648
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,272
[male #1]
And what of the other symbols

649
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,319
we have come to associate
with our country?

650
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:41,149
Can anybody tell me where
Plymouth Rock is located?

651
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:46,720
Does anyone know
when Jamestown was founded?

652
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:50,071
'Who can tell me the statement
of the Statue of Liberty'

653
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:52,117
its significance to us all?

654
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,775
Mrs. Walton..

655
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,822
'...you've had little at all
to say in this class thus far.'

656
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:05,956
Do you have any ideas?

657
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,527
Are you going
to remain silent all term?

658
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:19,100
A woman...named Emma Lazarus
wrote the poem

659
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:22,103
that's on the base
of the Statue of Liberty.

660
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,931
[softly]
Ah..

661
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:27,978
And would you be so kind
as to locate a copy of that poem

662
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,937
and bring it to class one day?

663
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,461
I know the poem
if you'd like to hear it.

664
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,115
[male #1]
By all means.

665
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:40,730
'It goes..'

666
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:45,996
..."Give me your tired,
your poor

667
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:50,349
"your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.

668
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:54,266
"The wretched refuse
of your teeming shore.

669
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:59,140
"Send these, the homeless,
tempest-tossed to me.

670
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,102
I lift my lamp
beside the golden door."

671
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,760
Very well said.

672
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:13,198
But it doesn't tell us

673
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:15,417
how you perceive the ideas

674
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:19,334
'it is trying to convey,
Mrs. Walton.'

675
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,946
I was about to do that,
Professor Trumbull.

676
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:28,909
The Statue of Liberty
is a symbol of hope

677
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:30,693
for people coming
from other countries.

678
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,918
To me, she's like a mother

679
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:42,009
offering them shelter and love
and a place to dream.

680
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:46,492
And since all our forefathers
came from somewhere else

681
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,885
I guess that applies
to all of us.

682
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:55,065
I think that's the message
the poem is trying to convey.

683
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,258
What do we have here,
a petition?

684
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,825
That's right. It is.
There are 65 names on there.

685
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,392
And they are all
concerned citizens

686
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,655
who don't think that
the development will be good

687
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:20,830
'for Jefferson County.'

688
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:23,746
Well, I'm a little surprised.

689
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,096
Wouldn't this bring new
customers into your store, Ike?

690
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,708
Well, not if they build
a new supermarket up there.

691
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:30,579
And the taxes will go up.

692
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:34,148
And suppose they decide
to pave all the roads?

693
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:36,368
It could mean a lot of new jobs.

694
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,979
That would be good
for the whole community.

695
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:43,462
We know all that. What really
is at stake is the way we live.

696
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:46,421
'Simple and neighborly and our
doors are always unlocked'

697
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,423
and the welcome mat
is always out.

698
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,947
We don't want Walton's Mountain
to be turned into

699
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:52,862
'some kind of suburb.'

700
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,212
I understand.

701
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,520
Well, I can't promise you
how I'll vote.

702
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:00,261
But I'll give this
serious consideration.

703
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:02,829
We knew you would.
That's why we voted for you.

704
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:07,486
Madison's tied up all this land
at the base of Pinetop Mountain.

705
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:11,838
They want to build 25 duplexes
and 50 single family homes.

706
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:13,666
That's a lot of lumber.

707
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:18,236
We could get rich on it.
And there'll be plenty of jobs.

708
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:21,543
- What do you think of it, ma?
- I don't know.

709
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,980
I don't even know
where I stand yet either.

710
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:26,026
'I can see both sides.'

711
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,506
[door opening]

712
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,072
Oh, I'm glad
somebody's still up.

713
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,683
How's the writin' going?

714
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,946
I've been over to the courthouse
going through records.

715
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,513
I went to the
county library.

716
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,776
Not a word. As if
the man never existed.

717
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,125
Why's it so important now?

718
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:39,648
It's one thing
to avoid something

719
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,084
because it's uncomfortable.

720
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:42,869
But to erase a man
from history.

721
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,914
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

722
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:48,614
No. If there's a skeleton hiding
in the family closet, grandma

723
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:50,703
I'd like to know
what it is.

724
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:53,836
I want my story to be honest.

725
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:56,143
How can it be honest
if a big piece

726
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,798
of your history
is missing?

727
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,801
- Go easy on her, son.
- She wouldn't want me to.

728
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,238
- She's the toughest person.
- John-Boy, you're over-tired.

729
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,631
You can say that again.

730
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,546
[knocking on door]

731
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:15,293
Janet, sweetheart,
what are you doing here?

732
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,731
I just threw myself together,
and I got out of New York.

733
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:19,949
What happened?

734
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,734
- Hi.
- Hey.

735
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:27,348
I've taken a leave of absence
from my job.

736
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,829
If it's alright with everybody,
I'd-I'd like for us

737
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,961
to get married here
at Walton's Mountain.

738
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:34,834
I think that would be great.
What about Aunt Flo?

739
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:37,010
I fired her.

740
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:39,795
Olivia, I'm not even sure
my folks are gonna make it.

741
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:43,712
I'm on my own
and I need you.

742
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:46,802
Well, bring your things in
and get settled.

743
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,761
We'll talk about
making plans later.

744
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:49,936
Come on.

745
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:54,767
I can't say
I'm unhappy about this

746
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:56,812
but how are we gonna
manage a wedding

747
00:38:56,899 --> 00:38:58,336
on top of
everything else?

748
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,250
I haven't
the slightest idea.

749
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:23,578
[knock on door]

750
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:26,320
Who is it?

751
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,801
Oh, Corabeth.
It's so nice to see you

752
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:30,803
but I'm-I'm really busy.

753
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,110
Oh, good! I deduced that
you might be scribbling away.

754
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:35,677
Corabeth, I don't scribble.
I write.

755
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:37,070
There's a big difference.

756
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:39,681
I did not mean to make light
of our profession.

757
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:43,293
And I didn't mean to be rude.
I got so much on my mind.

758
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,688
I'm behind schedule and I can't
express what I need to say.

759
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:49,691
Well, perhaps if you hear
just a bit of my novel

760
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,693
that will clear
the cobwebs away.

761
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,652
I find there's nothing
so inspiring

762
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:56,176
as the company
of a fellow writer.

763
00:39:58,047 --> 00:40:00,006
Go right ahead.

764
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,356
'Of course, this is
just a rough draft.'

765
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:07,492
"Romance on the High Sea..

766
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,321
"...by Corabeth Godsey.

767
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:15,848
"The young novelist,
Pierre Boudin

768
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:21,506
"stood on the deck, his shirt
unbuttoned to the waist

769
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:24,334
"revealing a wind-burned chest

770
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,860
rippling with masculine
muscularity."

771
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:30,558
Corabeth, young novelists
rarely strip to the waist--

772
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,908
"Below, the beautiful
young model lay trembling

773
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:35,433
"as she awaited his footsteps.

774
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,218
"She knew he would come,
and her bosoms heaved

775
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:40,002
"at the thought
of his fiery hands

776
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:42,744
on her firm young flesh."

777
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,141
I hope this is not too strong
for you, John-Boy.

778
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:51,840
I'm...speechless.

779
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:54,277
Oh, thank you.

780
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:58,543
You have no idea how much
your praise means to me.

781
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:05,245
"The helpless young woman knew
that to resist him was futile

782
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:08,030
and the desperate
pounding of her heart--"

783
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:11,164
Corabeth, stop it. Please.
Please stop. Stop.

784
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:13,079
Really? Really,
there's much more.

785
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,561
Corabeth...I don't know
how to tell you this.

786
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:20,478
It's not good. It's..

787
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:22,305
It's not good.

788
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:27,833
But...I'm following
the instructions

789
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,836
that came with that
correspondence course.

790
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:34,535
And I was inspired
by the romance

791
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:38,104
'between you and Janet.'

792
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,715
I don't like
hurting your feelings.

793
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,501
But you're my friend.

794
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:47,635
So I have to be truthful
about your...work.

795
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:49,898
You probably
can be a writer.

796
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:52,161
But instead of this nonsense,
you gotta start writing

797
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,381
about something
that you're familiar with.

798
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:56,557
Something you've
experienced and observed.

799
00:41:56,644 --> 00:42:00,387
Something that you care about
with feeling and passion.

800
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:03,956
I'm afraid I've experienced
very little in my lifetime.

801
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:05,958
You might think
that's true

802
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:08,351
but if you look,
I'll bet you'll find

803
00:42:08,438 --> 00:42:11,137
that there's plenty of love
and romance in your own life.

804
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:12,617
But you gotta
look for it.

805
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,710
I'm sorry, Corabeth,
but I had to be honest.

806
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:22,278
Oh, and I appreciate it.
I do.

807
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:26,152
And Corabeth,
there's one more thing.

808
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,895
Your hero's name,
Boudin?

809
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:32,332
It means...pudding.

810
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,777
[door opens and closes]

811
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,696
Oh, how about this one?
Isn't it wonderful?

812
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:52,482
It's not really you.

813
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,310
I don't think
it's really anyone.

814
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,187
I like this one.

815
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:04,407
Oh, that's too sexy
for a bridesmaid's dress.

816
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,106
Let's go somewhere else where
they carry the latest styles.

817
00:43:07,193 --> 00:43:09,456
You know,
the best shop in town?

818
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:11,676
[both]
This is the best shop in town.

819
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:15,767
Oh!

820
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:17,769
'Janet, it's time to learn
about high fashion'

821
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:19,205
'on Walton's Mountain.'

822
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,642
Oh, I'd love to help,
but I can't sew.

823
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:23,252
Janet.

824
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,645
You can cut.

825
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:26,647
I can cut.

826
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,303
Right here.
It's a good place to start.

827
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,827
Just cutting right
along the line.

828
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,176
All the way around.

829
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:35,700
Oh, there you are,
Corabeth.

830
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:37,963
I'm sorry, I didn't wanna
wake you so early.

831
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,312
Oh, very considerate of you

832
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,880
but I wanted to get this
in the mail quickly.

833
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:43,577
- Your correspondence course.
- I'm returning it.

834
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:45,710
It's filled
with erroneous advice.

835
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:50,062
I expect to get my money back as
promised in the advertisement.

836
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:52,107
I never got to read
your first novel.

837
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:53,587
I have abandoned it.

838
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:54,980
I'm starting
a new work

839
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:57,852
entitled
"The Storekeeper's Wife."

840
00:43:57,939 --> 00:43:59,811
Doesn't sound
very romantic.

841
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:03,336
Au contraire,John-Boy assuresme that there is a great deal

842
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:06,339
of romance and love
in being a storekeeper's wife.

843
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:11,213
Do you really believe
that, Corabeth?

844
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,433
Mr. Godsey, please.

845
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,654
Not in broad daylight.

846
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:19,874
Where's your
high-powered crew?

847
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:21,615
They're out making a delivery.

848
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:24,139
- Selling more lumber, I hope.
- I'll give you a hand.

849
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:26,925
There're some gloves
over there.

850
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:29,579
I need a chance
to let off some steam.

851
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,234
Yeah, same with me.

852
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:34,541
There's some rumors
going around I don't like.

853
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:35,934
Bad rumors?

854
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:38,066
Well, something about me
being a crook.

855
00:44:38,153 --> 00:44:40,678
You got too good a reputation.
Nobody's gonna believe that.

856
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:43,419
Don't count on it.
This is politics.

857
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:45,160
Right over here.

858
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:47,293
-This alright?
-Yep.

859
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,208
How's that
article coming?

860
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:51,340
I'm not getting
anywhere with it.

861
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,908
I'd appreciate it
if you'd take a look at it.

862
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:56,737
- I don't know about writing.
- But you do know grandma.

863
00:44:56,824 --> 00:44:58,826
That's for sure.

864
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:01,611
- Alright, I'll give it a try.
- Thanks.

865
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:05,528
[bell tolls]

866
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,922
Ah, Mrs. Walton,
what a pleasure.

867
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,924
Come walk with me
to my next class.

868
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:11,534
Don't we have
an appointment today?

869
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,536
Yes, I have
to clear my topic

870
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:15,495
for that oral report
you assigned us.

871
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:17,627
Have you gotten an idea yet?

872
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,586
Yes.

873
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:22,720
I'd like to do something on
the status of women in America.

874
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:25,157
Well, you'll have
to be more specific.

875
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:26,941
I'm reading this book
by Betty Friedan.

876
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:28,813
It's called
The Feminine Mystique.

877
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,730
What makes you think that would
be appropriate for my class?

878
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,383
She explains
how difficult it is

879
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,169
for women to achieve
in our society.

880
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:40,215
Some people try to make it
difficult for us to have careers

881
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,827
or...to get an education.

882
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:48,789
It seems to me our
country would be stronger

883
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:51,574
if we made it possible
for everybody to take part.

884
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:54,490
Alright, Mrs. Walton,
you can go ahead with it.

885
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:57,667
But I am warning you,
this is not the kind of

886
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,540
subject matter that will
assure you a passing grade.

887
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,150
You don't get it.

888
00:46:02,237 --> 00:46:04,196
It's not the grade
that's important to me.

889
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:07,199
It's the future of women
in this country I worry about.

890
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:09,462
Half the population
in this country is female

891
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:11,943
and three of those women
are my daughters.

892
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,901
I don't know
your three daughters.

893
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:15,947
But I'm beginning
to know you.

894
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:18,950
And I think I would be
quite foolish indeed

895
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:21,561
to antagonize the Walton women

896
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:24,782
to say nothing of half
the population of this country.

897
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,392
Huh, good luck with it.

898
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,353
We're delighted your nuptials
are gonna take place

899
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,442
on Walton's Mountain, John-Boy.

900
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:35,183
So am I, Miss Emily.

901
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,011
You'll be married
in the very church

902
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:40,319
that Ashley Longworth and I
were to march down the aisle.

903
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:41,799
Yes, ma'am.

904
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:45,846
Here you are, John-Boy.
Papa's old portmanteau.

905
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:48,327
It has all his letters.

906
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:50,720
And I hope, you find
what you're looking for.

907
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,505
- Thank you, Miss Mamie.
- You take it.

908
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:55,813
I'll take care of it and bring
it back as soon as possible.

909
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,902
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

910
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:00,469
- Bye-bye, Miss Emily.
- Bye.

911
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:02,994
Oh, what a fine, young man.

912
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:07,215
I wonder whatever became
of Ashley Longworth.

913
00:47:07,302 --> 00:47:09,261
He kissed me, you know.

914
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:11,306
'It was in October'

915
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:14,048
and all the leaves
were the color of gold.

916
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:19,140
It's a long way
from St. Bartholomew's.

917
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:21,229
It's-it's intimate.

918
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:26,234
I still can't believe it.

919
00:47:26,321 --> 00:47:29,759
In a few days, dad and I
will be walking down this aisle.

920
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,718
Yup.

921
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:33,720
Well, I'm not quite
as distinguished

922
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:35,983
as Ambassador Gilchrist
but would you care to practice?

923
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:41,206
Dad can be intimidating

924
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:43,251
but when you get
to know my parents

925
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:45,819
you'll find
they're good people.

926
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:48,648
I'm looking forward
to meeting 'em.

927
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,911
Do you ever sleep
with the windows open?

928
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:57,309
- Year round. How about you?
- I love fresh air.

929
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:00,442
- Do you like to read in bed?
- I like to read everywhere.

930
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,969
How do you feel
about big families?

931
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:09,147
I don't know how I feel
about any-size family.

932
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:10,888
Big, medium, or little.

933
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:16,154
Probably guess that's something
we're gonna have to talk about.

934
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:20,158
I've never been around babies.
They scare me.

935
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:22,943
Too bad, you had to fall
in love with a Walton.

936
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,424
Maybe you shouldn't be
marrying an only child.

937
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,345
Does it make a difference..

938
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,609
...when we have each other?

939
00:48:38,045 --> 00:48:39,786
I guess not.

940
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:56,063
[door opening]

941
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,810
'Lot of homework, huh?'

942
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:07,988
Mostly I've been working
on those bridesmaid's dresses.

943
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:10,034
How's John-Boy's article?

944
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:13,776
Tell you the truth,
I don't think it's very good.

945
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:15,430
He can't concentrate.

946
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:17,737
He's got a lot of things
on his mind.

947
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:20,783
I know. That's why
I can't tell him that.

948
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,482
You have to.
He asked you to be honest.

949
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:26,006
It seems like we got
an awful lot of things

950
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:29,444
to worry about
around here lately.

951
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:33,361
Do you think John-Boy and Janet
are right for each other?

952
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:36,625
I think Janet can hold her own
with our son, Liv.

953
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:38,932
I don't think writers
are easy to live with.

954
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,979
She is a thoroughbred.

955
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,242
That's what worries me.

956
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:47,158
They come from such
different backgrounds.

957
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:50,291
That's what people said about
us when we got married.

958
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:54,513
I guess differences
don't always matter.

959
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,950
Some of them do.

960
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,865
Why, John Walton.

961
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,521
[honking]

962
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:03,739
What the heck?

963
00:50:03,826 --> 00:50:06,742
[dog barking]

964
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:08,396
[country music]

965
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:11,965
What's goin' on out there?

966
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:15,403
[music continues]

967
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,231
Just hold your horses!

968
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:25,196
Hello.

969
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:29,504
I know it's a little late
to come calling

970
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:33,421
but I've been searching all over
this countryside for a hotel

971
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:36,729
and I've come to the conclusion
that there isn't one.

972
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:39,819
You're right.
This isn't one either.

973
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:42,735
Aunt Flo?
Wha-what are you doing here?

974
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:45,999
Janet, darling, I was thinking
about your honeymoon.

975
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:49,568
I was in the bath and..
Oh, how do you do?

976
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:51,613
And, um, I had
the most wonderful idea.

977
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,181
You've got to let me
do this for you, sweetheart.

978
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:56,314
[Janet]
'Fine, fine. Come on in.'

979
00:50:58,794 --> 00:51:00,970
So that's Aunt Flo.

980
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,803
[grunts]

981
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,588
Oh! Gee!

982
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:14,506
[birds chirping]

983
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:26,257
- Good morning, daddy.
- 'Mornin'.'

984
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:28,259
Whatever that is,
I hope it's edible.

985
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:32,219
Your mama was teaching Janet
to make baking powder biscuits.

986
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,829
They wanted you
to have some.

987
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:37,442
I like the room service
at this hotel.

988
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:39,139
Thank you.

989
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:43,404
Mmm.

990
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,712
Janet wanted me to tell you
her Aunt Flo got in last night.

991
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:48,757
Isn't she gonna give up.
Where is she?

992
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:50,019
She's staying with us.

993
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,021
I'll avoid the house
as much as possible.

994
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,371
That was my plan.

995
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:57,549
- I read your article, son.
- What do you think?

996
00:51:57,636 --> 00:51:59,986
I don't know.

997
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:02,684
Seems to me that,
maybe you're looking

998
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:04,904
at your grandma through
rose-colored glasses.

999
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,124
I know.
I left the vinegar out.

1000
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:10,344
You turned her
into some kind of saint.

1001
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:12,129
You know if grandma
hadn't been tough

1002
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,261
and stubborn as a mule

1003
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:16,568
she never would've
overcome her stroke

1004
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:18,787
or gone on living
without grandpa.

1005
00:52:18,874 --> 00:52:21,921
I intended toughening her up,
it's just that..

1006
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:23,966
I think what's throwing
this whole thing off

1007
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,795
is the missing ancestry story.
This gap in her family history.

1008
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:29,276
'I just can't get past that.'

1009
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:32,975
Well, I gave you
my two cents worth.

1010
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:35,108
I'll let you get on
with your work.

1011
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:38,503
Thanks, daddy.

1012
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,834
[breathing heavily]

1013
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:16,628
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, mama.

1014
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,588
Grandma.

1015
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:23,417
I went to see the
Baldwin ladies the other day.

1016
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:26,377
And they gave me some
of your papa's old papers

1017
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:29,858
and I found this letter
about your daddy.

1018
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:31,991
I thought we agreed
to forget about that.

1019
00:53:32,078 --> 00:53:34,689
You know what I found out
from this letter?

1020
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:38,258
Grandpa Morgan fought with
the Union in the Civil War.

1021
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:40,695
- Damnit! Damnit! Damnit!
- Alright. Alright.

1022
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:43,089
The war of Northern Aggression.

1023
00:53:43,176 --> 00:53:45,047
John-Boy.

1024
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,832
'I also found out
he was anti-slavery'

1025
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:48,660
'like a lot
of these hill people.'

1026
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:50,575
And when he joined
the Union Army

1027
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:52,490
everyone around here
called him a traitor.

1028
00:53:52,577 --> 00:53:53,839
[Olivia]
'Is that all, grandma?'

1029
00:53:53,926 --> 00:53:56,407
Is that what you didn't
want us to find out?

1030
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:58,931
As far as I'm concerned,
my great-granddaddy is a hero.

1031
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:00,759
I wanna tell
the world about him.

1032
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:02,543
It's alright, ma.
I'll talk to him.

1033
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,371
Daddy, this should
not be a secret.

1034
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:07,156
It's wrong to bury
somebody's history.

1035
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,811
That's enough, son.

1036
00:54:09,898 --> 00:54:13,772
I think...we should all sleep
on this, especially grandma.

1037
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:16,557
It's not good for her
to get upset like this.

1038
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:18,211
Grandma, I'm sorry about this.

1039
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:21,170
I love you,
and I respect you

1040
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,694
but I'm gonna write the truth.

1041
00:54:27,394 --> 00:54:28,874
'Oh-oh, something's up.'

1042
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:32,269
Maybe I oughta go, huh?

1043
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,009
You better not.

1044
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:36,664
Morning, daddy.

1045
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,840
I thought it was good

1046
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:40,015
till I read this.

1047
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,328
"Supervisor Walton in sweetheart
deal with developer.

1048
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:50,939
"It's been discovered that John
Walton and Son Lumber Company

1049
00:54:51,026 --> 00:54:53,159
"has a lucrative contract

00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:55,335
"to supply lumber
should their subdivision

1051
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:56,858
receive county approval."

1052
00:54:56,945 --> 00:54:59,252
And that vote comes tonight.

1053
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:02,429
Go on, read.
There's more.

1054
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:05,127
"Supervisor Walton's integrity
is in question for his failure

1055
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:07,304
to report this
conflict of interest."

1056
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,828
Not only is our whole
business at stake

1057
00:55:09,915 --> 00:55:12,134
but so is my reputation.

1058
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:14,746
For 200 years, our family
has lived in these parts

1059
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:18,271
and this is the first time that
a shadow's been put on our name.

1060
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,492
A stain like this
hangs around.

1061
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:24,886
On me, on your brothers
and sisters, on everybody.

1062
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:26,410
Daddy, I'm really sorry.

1063
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:34,766
You got me in to this.
What are you gonna do about it?

1064
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:36,028
I don't know.

1065
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:38,335
I wouldn't blame you
if you threw me out.

1066
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:39,901
I feel the same way, John.

1067
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:42,730
You oughta fire
both of us right now.

1068
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,517
I'm considerin' it.

1069
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,438
[Ben sighs]

1070
00:55:58,311 --> 00:56:00,748
It's bad enough she tried
to take over the wedding.

1071
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:02,837
She is not gonna
take over the honeymoon.

1072
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:04,491
[Janet]
'Would you please
stop shouting?'

1073
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:06,754
She's only suggesting that
we go to the Bahamas.

1074
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:08,582
Suggesting? She already
bought the airline tickets.

1075
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:10,845
'She hired a limousine
to go to the airport.'

1076
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:12,412
- She's made reservations.
- She meant well.

1077
00:56:12,499 --> 00:56:14,196
She's only trying
to do something nice.

1078
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:17,286
She'll be at our wedding night
to ensure we get that right.

1079
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,201
You might've been appreciative.
You insulted her.

1080
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:20,768
It was long overdue!

1081
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:22,814
Maybe we should call
the whole thing off!

1082
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:25,077
That's fine. Maybe I can get
some work done.

1083
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:27,471
- Fine!
- Fine!

1084
00:56:27,558 --> 00:56:28,863
Fine.

1085
00:56:33,912 --> 00:56:35,392
[car starts]

1086
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:38,090
John-Boy.

1087
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:47,926
Janet.

1088
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:51,886
[knock on door]

1089
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:58,719
How you doin'?

1090
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:01,461
I tried to call my mom,
but the lines are down.

1091
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:03,507
I don't know what to do.

1092
00:57:03,594 --> 00:57:06,945
I know it's not the same
but she's there, and I'm here.

1093
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:08,512
Is there anything
I can do?

1094
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,514
I never knew
he had such a temper.

1095
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:13,081
Oh, he has
a temper, alright.

1096
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:15,475
Takes a lot for him
to lose it.

1097
00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:17,085
He yelled at me.

1098
00:57:17,172 --> 00:57:21,046
Well, you were doing some
pretty good yelling yourself.

1099
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:24,136
I don't know what made me think
I wanted to marry him.

1100
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,531
All of a sudden, he seems
like a total stranger.

1101
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:29,402
I know what you mean.

1102
00:57:32,274 --> 00:57:33,928
Marriage changes everything,
doesn't it?

1103
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,104
It sure does.

1104
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:37,802
First, you lose your name.

1105
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,065
You find strange clothes
in your closet.

1106
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:42,850
You discover that wonderful man
you married snores in his sleep

1107
00:57:42,937 --> 00:57:44,678
and you consider the
consequences of murder.

1108
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:50,989
All my life, I've never had
to share my room with anyone.

1109
00:57:51,076 --> 00:57:55,123
I've been able to do what I
wanna do when I wanna do it.

1110
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,125
All that's gonna
be different.

1111
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:59,171
Maybe that's what's
bothering you.

1112
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:01,347
Instead of John-Boy
being upset over

1113
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:03,567
what he has a right
to be upset over.

1114
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:08,267
Hard being married, isn't it?

1115
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:13,925
It's the hardest thing
you'll ever do.

1116
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:19,234
- I'm scared.
- Marriage is scary.

1117
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:20,845
But I think it's worth it.

1118
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:23,412
No. I'm scared
he won't come back.

1119
00:58:25,023 --> 00:58:26,024
Oh!

1120
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:35,468
[male #2]
'Alright.
Let's settle down.'

1121
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:37,122
[hammering]

1122
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:38,993
Let's settle down, please.

1123
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,560
[hammering]

1124
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:46,784
The first item on the agenda
is Madison's request

1125
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:49,047
to build a one hundred unit
subdivision.

1126
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:56,663
'In regard to this issue, there
may be a conflict of interest'

1127
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:59,666
'on the Board of Supervisors.'

1128
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:01,712
Mr. Walton, would you
care to address

1129
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:03,540
the accusations against you?

1130
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:05,411
Mr. Chairman, may I have
the floor?

1131
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:08,893
- I'd like to say something.
- Go ahead, Ben.

1132
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:16,901
Father asked me to take care
of the mill during his campaign.

1133
00:59:16,988 --> 00:59:20,600
I made the deal with
Madison Development Company.

1134
00:59:20,687 --> 00:59:22,863
Long before I knew
that my father was gonna

1135
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,300
be coming here to vote today.

1136
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:28,390
Daddy never had anything
to do with any of this.

1137
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,437
I just wanted him
to be proud of me.

1138
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:34,527
Instead, I've
made him look bad.

1139
00:59:34,614 --> 00:59:36,485
I'm sorry.

1140
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,184
[group chattering]

1141
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:42,317
'If there are no objections,
let's move on to the vote.'

1142
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:44,450
Now, you all know
where I stand.

1143
00:59:44,537 --> 00:59:47,801
I feel that the subdivision
would benefit Jefferson County.

1144
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:51,675
I vote, yes.

1145
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:54,765
All supervisors in favor,
could I see a show of hands.

1146
00:59:57,768 --> 00:59:58,986
Two.

1147
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:00,031
Opposed?

1148
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:04,644
'Two oppose.'

1149
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,561
Supervisor Walton,
looks like it's up to you.

1150
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:19,354
It seems to me
we have a problem.

1151
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:23,489
There's unemployment here.
Folks need jobs.

1152
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:25,883
'At the same time,
we don't want to destroy'

1153
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,972
'the air and the water
and the woods'

1154
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:30,670
'that makes Jefferson County
such a fine place to live in.'

1155
01:00:32,367 --> 01:00:36,676
So...I'm gonna vote
no on this proposal.

1156
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:39,287
'But if those folks bring
back a simpler proposal'

1157
01:00:39,374 --> 01:00:41,333
that provides jobs

1158
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,597
but doesn't ruin the air we
breathe or the water we drink

1159
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,207
then I'll vote for it.

1160
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:50,516
'And if they do come back
with a new proposal'

1161
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:53,562
I'll make damn sure
my company's not involved.

1162
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:01,962
Mr. Anderson, it could've
turned out different.

1163
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:03,703
- Handled that well, John.
- Thank you, Ike.

1164
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,227
Goodnight, fellas.

1165
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:08,490
I like the way you handled
yourself tonight, son.

1166
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:10,014
I appreciate it.

1167
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:12,756
Drew and I are willing
to take a cut in pay

1168
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:14,322
till we get
outta this hole.

1169
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:16,934
I just might have
to take you up on that.

1170
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:19,980
Unless you get out there
and hustle up some business.

1171
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:22,679
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, you bet.

1172
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,724
Just don't stand there,
let's see some hustle.

1173
01:01:24,811 --> 01:01:26,639
- Okay, daddy.
- Let's do it.

1174
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:34,516
[crickets chirping]

1175
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:45,702
John.

1176
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:50,576
You're a tougher young man
than I thought.

1177
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:52,317
You're pretty tough yourself.

1178
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:59,454
You know, uh..

1179
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:05,460
John, I see that I have caused
you and Janet some distress.

1180
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:10,204
But I want you
to know that I..

1181
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,337
...I acted
only out of love.

1182
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:14,382
I never doubted that.

1183
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:17,559
I never had any children
of my own.

1184
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:21,215
I think I just forgot to.

1185
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,609
And my brother
just had the one.

1186
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:26,046
'And I was there
when Janet was born'

1187
01:02:26,133 --> 01:02:28,832
'and I looked forward to being
there when she married.'

1188
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:33,097
But I really think now
that I should leave

1189
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:35,229
before I break up this
wedding altogether.

1190
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:37,318
Too late for that.
You can't leave now.

1191
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:39,451
Why?

1192
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:42,149
Because you're family.

1193
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:44,978
Besides, I thought you were
gonna be my matron of honor.

1194
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:48,852
Sweetie.

1195
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,337
Only if you promise
to toss the wedding bouquet

1196
01:02:56,424 --> 01:02:57,730
in my general direction.

1197
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:59,210
[Janet]
'I promise.'

1198
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:08,915
I'm sorry.

1199
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:12,658
I should not have yelled
at you like that.

1200
01:03:14,355 --> 01:03:17,097
I'm sorry too. I..

1201
01:03:17,184 --> 01:03:19,404
I didn't know how
to stand up to Flo.

1202
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,104
Well..

1203
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:28,500
...the Bahamas
are fine with me.

1204
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:32,591
No. No, no.

1205
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:34,593
We'll make our own plans.

1206
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,162
We'll...go someplace
simple and quiet

1207
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:40,947
where we can be by ourselves,
just the two of us.

1208
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:46,213
Why don't you leave
our first night to me?

1209
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,433
I know just the place.

1210
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,785
It's a small inn on the
north side of Drucilla's Pond.

1211
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,569
Quiet.

1212
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:57,572
You can hear the leaves
rustle at night.

1213
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:01,359
In the morning, you can hear
the birds call to each other.

1214
01:04:01,446 --> 01:04:03,404
That sounds good.

1215
01:04:03,491 --> 01:04:05,754
And the next day..

1216
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,061
...we'll go to the Bahamas.

1217
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:09,236
We will?

1218
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:11,195
Too good a deal
to pass up.

1219
01:04:11,282 --> 01:04:13,588
[laughing]

1220
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,558
It's a beautiful
quilt, Olivia.

1221
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:28,603
How long have you
been working on it?

1222
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,214
Oh, quite a while.

1223
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:33,347
I had a feeling
the first time I met Janet.

1224
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:36,002
Has quilting been a family
tradition for a long time?

1225
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:38,004
It goes back a way.

1226
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:41,921
A family is like the rings made
when a pebble drops in a pond.

1227
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:43,705
'Like the rings on this quilt.'

1228
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:47,884
I wonder, if I had, had
a quilt like this

1229
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:51,583
perhaps, one of my marriages
might've lasted a little longer.

1230
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,845
[laughing]

1231
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:54,629
It takes more
than a quilt.

1232
01:04:54,716 --> 01:04:57,328
[Aunt Flo]
'You should know.'

1233
01:04:57,415 --> 01:04:59,286
What's your secret, Olivia?

1234
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:02,768
I've no idea. Sometimes,
I think I know a thing or two.

1235
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:05,075
Then a whole new set
of problems comes up.

1236
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:07,338
I'd like to think
that each stitch is like

1237
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:10,254
a special wish
for the bride and groom.

1238
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:11,820
My stitches are
for the happiness

1239
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,258
I wish them
in the years to come.

1240
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:16,173
What is my wish for them?

1241
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,392
The word is romance.

1242
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:21,134
It's what makes
the world go round.

1243
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:26,052
I wish them a happy,
carefree wedding

1244
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:29,229
and forgiveness
for my excesses.

1245
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:30,752
[laughing]

1246
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:34,234
You were forgiven
a long time ago.

1247
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:36,280
Where's grandma?
Isn't she going to join us?

1248
01:05:36,367 --> 01:05:39,413
Nope. She says she's not
even coming to the wedding.

1249
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,501
Oh, mama!
What happened?

1250
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:42,373
[phone rings]

1251
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,071
Would you get that, Janet?
It's probably for John-Boy.

1252
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:53,427
Walton residence.

1253
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,428
Speaking.

1254
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:58,867
Dad! How are you?
Where are you?

1255
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:04,308
It's my folks. They're at
the airport in London.

1256
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:06,832
'John and I will pick you
up at the airport'

1257
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:09,443
'in Charlottesville
tomorrow night.'

1258
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,010
Wonderful.

1259
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:12,751
See you then.

1260
01:06:14,753 --> 01:06:16,320
Bravo!

1261
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:25,285
I don't understand
what's keeping 'em.

1262
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:27,287
They should've been
here an hour ago.

1263
01:06:27,374 --> 01:06:29,376
Will you stop worrying
and sit down?

1264
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:31,552
I've never entertained
an ambassador before.

1265
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:36,818
If they're anything like Janet,
they'll be real down to earth.

1266
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:39,343
What's the name of that country
he's ambassador to?

1267
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,519
I'll think of it.

1268
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:44,217
Oh, this tie
is killing me.

1269
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,524
I'll be glad when this
wedding stuff is over.

1270
01:06:46,611 --> 01:06:48,482
[phone rings]

1271
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,312
Get back to normal livin'.

1272
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:53,835
Hello?

1273
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:56,708
Janet! You alright?

1274
01:06:56,795 --> 01:06:58,231
We'll be right there.

1275
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:00,581
- What's up?
- They're all in jail.

1276
01:07:00,668 --> 01:07:02,583
'Jail?'

1277
01:07:13,203 --> 01:07:15,074
- Howdy, folks.
- We're here to see--

1278
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,337
- Daddy!
- Oh, there he is.

1279
01:07:17,424 --> 01:07:19,296
- John-Boy, what's going on?
- Janet, what happened?

1280
01:07:19,383 --> 01:07:21,080
The plane was late,
I was trying

1281
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,430
to make up some time
on the way home.

1282
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:27,826
He was doing that alright.
75 per in a 60-mile zone.

1283
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:30,916
- John-Boy.
- You lock people up for that?

1284
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:35,051
We do. When they yell at the
officer and call him "Stupid."

1285
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:39,794
Uh, John, Olivia,
these are my parents

1286
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:42,275
Uh, Ralph and
Charlotte Gilchrist.

1287
01:07:42,362 --> 01:07:43,885
[both]
How do you do?

1288
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:46,279
That one kept talking
about something, uh

1289
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:49,587
diplomatic impunity,
whatever that is.

1290
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:54,331
I-I am a United States
ambassador.

1291
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:56,202
That entitles me
to certain privileges.

1292
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:59,292
And I am a deputy sheriff
of Jefferson County, Virginia

1293
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:01,860
and this is my jail.

1294
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:05,864
Mr. Walton, my husband and I
left a small African country

1295
01:08:05,951 --> 01:08:08,388
over 48 hours ago.

1296
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:10,912
In that time, we've not
had a change of clothes

1297
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:14,655
a decent meal or used
a clean bathroom.

1298
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:16,918
Could you please
get us out of here?

1299
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:19,617
Yes, ma'am.

1300
01:08:19,704 --> 01:08:22,228
Now, you must be new
around here, deputy.

1301
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:25,318
I'm John Walton,
County Supervisor.

1302
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:28,147
And you're just gonna have
to learn something about this

1303
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:30,628
diplomatic..

1304
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:32,456
[both]
Immunity.

1305
01:08:32,543 --> 01:08:34,066
...immunity.

1306
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:36,242
Supervisor Walton.
Yeah, I know about you.

1307
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:39,941
We sure could use some
things fixed around here

1308
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:41,334
when you get a chance.

1309
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:43,815
And we need to get
these people outta here.

1310
01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:46,252
These two young people
are getting married tomorrow.

1311
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:49,516
Well, why didn't
you say so?

1312
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:51,605
I'm letting you off
with just a warning.

1313
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:53,216
Well, that's decent of you.

1314
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:56,262
Now, if you'll open this cell
door, we'll be on our way.

1315
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:58,438
Can't.
It's broke.

1316
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:01,180
You get me a bigger budget,
and I'll fix it.

1317
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:09,362
- Ah!
- Oh!

1318
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:11,756
Now, you must make sure
this thing can lock.

1319
01:09:11,843 --> 01:09:13,671
Any criminal
could walk out..

1320
01:09:13,758 --> 01:09:16,413
No, no, not you.

1321
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,416
Oh, don't worry.
He'll-he'll get over it.

1322
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:23,724
Sorry about this, daddy.

1323
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,816
I'd say we haven't exactly
gotten off to a beautiful start

1324
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:30,557
with the Gilchrists.

1325
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:42,221
Janet, in my professional life

1326
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:46,007
I have found myself
in some very strange places.

1327
01:09:46,094 --> 01:09:47,618
Still, I have trouble believing

1328
01:09:47,705 --> 01:09:49,924
that I am in the
backwoods of Virginia.

1329
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:52,927
Miles from a streetlight,
with a clan of people

1330
01:09:53,014 --> 01:09:55,669
that seems to number
into the thousands.

1331
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:59,369
And that my daughter is about
to marry into that clan of

1332
01:09:59,456 --> 01:10:01,762
folksy, fertile

1333
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:04,287
poor but honest salt of
the Earth mountaineers.

1334
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:06,419
Have-have-have you given
this sufficient thought?

1335
01:10:08,073 --> 01:10:09,770
I think so.

1336
01:10:09,857 --> 01:10:12,033
And you're totally comfortable
with what you're doing?

1337
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,906
Even though it may mean
that you'll have to subsist on

1338
01:10:14,993 --> 01:10:17,996
chitlins and bootleg liquor
when the going gets tough?

1339
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:20,564
I've never been happier
in my life, daddy.

1340
01:10:23,697 --> 01:10:25,786
Good.

1341
01:10:25,873 --> 01:10:29,050
Because I like your young man,
and I like where he comes from.

1342
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:30,138
These are good people.

1343
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,966
There's only one thing, daddy.

1344
01:10:32,053 --> 01:10:35,100
I doubt very much they've ever
had chitlins in their lives.

1345
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:40,323
Well, bring 'em on out to Iowa,
and we'll give 'em a sample.

1346
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,846
Tell her, Charlotte.

1347
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:44,457
Well, your father
has decided

1348
01:10:44,544 --> 01:10:47,678
to retire from
the Diplomatic Corps.

1349
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:49,462
We wanna be home again.

1350
01:10:49,549 --> 01:10:52,248
We want you to have
a home to come home to.

1351
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:55,076
Not an embassy
in some troubled country.

1352
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:57,818
We're going home to Iowa

1353
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:00,865
to buy back the house
on East River Drive.

1354
01:11:00,952 --> 01:11:03,041
I've always loved
that house.

1355
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,436
I know. Well, you've gotten
in touch with John's roots.

1356
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:09,221
In Iowa, John can get
in touch with yours.

1357
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:11,223
You know, I cannot
wait to bring him

1358
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,356
and our children

And the reception 
was just about

1571
01:24:54,567 --> 01:24:57,527
the grandest party ever held 
on Walton's Mountain.
