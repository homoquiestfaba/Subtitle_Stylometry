Who will be next?

4
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:12,676
Well Bobby Tricker

5
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,363
Asco! He scratches his nose,
and eats boogers

6
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,363
What's that? Is weak

7
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,763
Well friends, we can do
Chrissy we can only take

8
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,896
Red Rover, Red Rover send to
Tricker Bobby immediately!

9
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:05,335
Hi, Sam had to leave
but leave your message, here comes the beep

10
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:09,341
Hi, I was not sure
out the correct number ...

11
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,894
But now I hear your voice
the message is that it is you

12
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:14,694
I! Chrissy, ie that
is waiting ...

13
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:18,998
Expecting a baby, and I also hope
show up as promised

14
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:24,229
In the old days ... I say we are not old
but if we are an old group

15
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,896
So I hope you come ... after all
A promise is a promise

16
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:44,472
Thomas Wolf once said
"You can not go home"

17
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,348
What is good for Tom, but it was a girl
he had made a pact with her friends ...

18
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:52,481
At the age of 12 years to meet when
some of them needed it.

19
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:57,500
So here I am, driving down
my childhood, somewhere in Indiana

20
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:01,244
A place you should know not wish to return.

21
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,401
So imagine that a promise
is a promise ...

22
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,692
I chose a bad day to quit.

23
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,309
Hi Doc Coming to Play?

24
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:29,176
Not today, I'm busy ... oh that's for me.

25
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:06,191
Good morning, Chrissy Is there anybody home?

26
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,232
One minute!

27
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,890
Now look at your shoulder, baby.

28
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:24,421
Hi, stop by the store and thought of you.

29
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:25,263
Thanks!

30
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,975
Do not go near the stove or operated

31
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,365
Very funny

32
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:31,677
But if this baby is born I will soon have
that out myself.

33
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,012
That would be nice.

34
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:33,886
"Where is the list?

35
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:35,012
I have.

36
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:42,422
What I can not believe it has to
people so excited?

37
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:47,396
- Long legs, waist and beautiful breasts.
- Roberta I do not like dirty things.

38
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:49,053
Chrissy's breasts are nothing dirty.

39
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,180
- I can not hear!
- Boobs!

40
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,073
- I can not hear!
- Boobs!

41
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:52,429
- I can not hear!
- Boobs!

42
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,740
Hello ... I'm glad to see you.

43
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,600
Hi Roberta, you look great.

44
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:36,808
- How are you?
- Well!

45
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:37,733
Photo!

46
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,046
And you, Look!

47
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:48,181
Thanks for coming.

48
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:00,265
Hey bitches.

49
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,201
Holy God!

50
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:04,610
- How do you star?
- Hi Roberta

51
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,948
- Glad to see you.
- Oh God!

52
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:07,134
Photo!

53
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:12,653
- Look at your belly!
- Tina Tercell!

54
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:21,181
Photo!

55
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:22,617
No, you look good!

56
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,001
Yes, I'm a supermodel

57
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:29,254
- Glad to see you Teeny
- It's been a long time

58
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,946
Go Girls enter.

59
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:43,927
- Well, the weather turned.
- It looks exactly like when you moved here.

60
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:47,462
You know what they say,
Like mother like daughter.

61
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:53,371
What I offer you a drink?

62
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,558
- Whisky would be nice.
- That I love.

63
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,245
We do not have these liqueurs at home.

64
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,985
Well what is right.

65
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,659
Beer, beer.

66
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:04,945
- Cool.
- Cool.

67
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:07,759
- Okay.
- Back in a second.

68
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:16,269
I was looking for one of these.

69
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:35,711
- I can not believe that you've retained.
- Morton wanted to throw it away and use the wood.

70
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:38,862
- If you love.
- But could not afford, well not mine.

71
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,381
It belongs to all.

72
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:49,444
I am so grateful you came.

73
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:56,496
Do not worry I think Chrissy will be a
great mother, a little heavy and stiff

74
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:59,469
But by the grace of God, the boy grow
relatively unharmed.

75
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,477
And if not, it is therapy.

76
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:07,570
I can not believe they expect a baby Chrissy
I feel so old.

77
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:13,462
All this puzzled me baby
ie they are educated

78
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:17,505
And inevitably something goes wrong, one is
Recently, the guilt makes us feel that way.

79
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:21,670
- This crazy!
- If you have a baby only perpetuates the vicious cycle.

80
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,752
Herod Thanks!

81
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,597
- What are you working now Sam?
- In another.

82
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:33,422
If you ask me, you should write something
that people can relate

83
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:37,910
I have not understood any of the things you
writing about aliens.

84
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:40,280
"I can take that as a compliment?

85
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:48,267
How about a romance novel as Danielle "
Steve? She really knows how to keep the emotion.

86
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:55,411
Roberta is true, the longer the
more books are sold.

87
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:58,465
You know something? I would like to see them more often.

88
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,832
What happened?

89
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:03,080
10 years ago who did not return.

90
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,967
- Do not complain.
- I'm sorry.

91
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:09,233
Roberta has chosen to be such ...

92
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:10,833
Alternative!

93
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:14,021
Living in sin with her boyfriend but is normal.

94
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:15,021
If I am normal.

95
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,232
There have been 4 failed marriages ...

96
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:19,627
Neither has completed a series of monogamous relationships ...

97
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:21,974
Not wearing black.

98
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:26,146
- It's happy.
- Technically, I have been married 3 times.

99
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,659
The first was annulled.

100
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:28,996
See?

101
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:35,269
You think everything is funny, if I
should ask mature.

102
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:41,150
Maybe it's true.

103
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,758
Indiana Shelby was not the place
exciting I know ...

104
00:10:56,246 --> 00:11:00,532
In fact the most common cause of death before
of puberty, was boredom.

105
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:07,583
And in the days before MTV and Nintendo, we
to look as entertain.

106
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:19,470
The summer of 1970 began like any other summer
school was out ...

107
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,316
And we had 3 months of boredom, but that year was not enough freedom, wanted independence ...

108
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:30,619
Own place, so we decided to buy
a tree house ...

109
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:33,318
And the search for making money was the goal of the summer.

110
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:39,750
The 4 lived in a beautiful new neighborhood ...

111
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:43,047
Within a planned community and built ...

112
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,571
When everything came back
and the old things went.

113
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:56,395
- I'm tired of this I do not listen anymore.
- But ...

114
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,825
- But what?
- Calm down please.

115
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:04,962
I'm tired of talking about these things How many times we'll have this conversation?

116
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:11,615
Any partner is having trouble Why not
try to fix it?

117
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:15,951
- We have tried too, is useless.
- Maybe if you spend more time at home.

118
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:18,504
No! Say What for?

119
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:29,922
Come here

120
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:50,364
My parents had been fighting since
I have memory, I never bothered

121
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:55,498
It was actually the opposite, it was so comfortable
this consistency.

122
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:21,373
No matter what I do is get bigger.

123
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,629
Breakfast is cold, hurry

124
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:48,800
Roberta grew up with his father 3 older brothers
his mother died when she was 4 years old

125
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:54,150
That's his picture, never leaves home without it.

126
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:11,497
Tina, Tell us, did you feel at the exact moment
they knew you were chosen?

127
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:17,655
Well I can only say that I've dreamed of this day ...

128
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:26,910
... I've dreamed of this day since I have memory

129
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:34,114
Winning an Academy Award at such a young age
is an incredible achievement. Where will you go from here?

130
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:40,277
Teeny was an only child, his parents liked
meetings with her were never

131
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:43,958
They were gifted actors and pathological liars.

132
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,235
92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 ...

133
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:05,655
Chrissy, oh sorry darling "I can go?

134
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,161
Sure!

135
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh shut this daughter, the discs become dusty

136
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:15,083
Oh oh, covered up and down okay?

137
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:22,987
Chrissy know ... I thought ... what I wonder

138
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:25,111
"About sex?

139
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:33,460
If you love, you mentioned and my mom is scared to say boo played! I felt so

140
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,628
Sorry Mom

141
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:39,634
Okay, okay, I think you're too young
to be informed

142
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:43,260
But your friends will tell lies
I think I'll give you the facts.

143
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:49,014
This will be a shock to you but ...

144
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,368
This is a flower ...

145
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,513
all women have a garden

146
00:15:57,843 --> 00:16:00,830
And a garden needs a huge pipeline to water it ...

147
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,019
Or a little while to work ...

148
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:12,912
As a direct result of that conversation Chrissy spent part of his adult life obsessed with gardening.

149
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:22,230
These are worms, everyone in the neighborhood
Felt sorry for his mother.

150
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:28,297
Since we had a goal of summer, let us
life miserable.

151
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,281
They were the enemy

152
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,896
Hi dirty worm.

153
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:33,754
Now!

154
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:44,513
Chrissy down

155
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:47,362
Run, run.

156
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:53,870
"Roberta, are you okay?

157
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:58,345
We have a worm, and always get.

158
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:01,463
As if we were afraid of little girls

159
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:03,238
Best bear this

160
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:57,782
Your idea of ??an appointment is sensual: A) A light dinner
candlelight and a walk in the moonlight.

161
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:01,758
B) lie down on the skin of a bear
a cabin in the mountains.

162
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,363
C) Watch a sexy tape or
D) All of the above.

163
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:06,861
B

164
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,550
E, none of the above.

165
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:13,771
Roberta, this is not a possible answer

166
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:16,761
B then

167
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:18,658
Definitely A

168
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:20,285
Surprise, Surprise!

169
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,904
I choose D, the above

170
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,822
Surprise, Surprise!

171
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,889
Are 107 and 24 cents

172
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,502
How much more do we need?

173
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,972
- 23 more and the house will be ours
- Hear the first night we'll have a party.

174
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,148
Oh Sam, your mom!

175
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,708
- What are your short pants
- What are your high boots.

176
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:58,941
Do not know why, but at the beginning of summer my mom
He began to dress like Nancy Sinatra

177
00:19:02,294 --> 00:19:05,668
Wow your mom is great

178
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:11,506
Hey girls, today will be the full moon festival
of spirits returning to earth ...

179
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:13,540
And walk among the living

180
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,915
4 black cows is $ 1.90 children

181
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:20,509
We are girls

182
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:24,613
I know

183
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:33,478
- It's too weird
- What did you expect? It's a witch

184
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:37,740
I swear it Budu dolls and everything else

185
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:40,809
Listen to this

186
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,776
One of the dolls looked like the director Winters
And you know something?

187
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:48,097
Had a needle through his heart ...

188
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,813
I met him a day before the heart attack

189
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:07,736
- Then do another session tonight?
- It did not work last time and will not this time.

190
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:13,114
If it worked, this is the night that the barrier
between death and living can be broken

191
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:17,135
- I read in the encyclopedia of supernatural phenomena.
- You are so strange.

192
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,977
- I come.
- Yeah, me too.

193
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:26,720
Read the horoscope, Roberta, you're a woman, even your sensuality is hidden ...

194
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,682
You are like a volcano ready to erupt ... Wow Roberta beware.

195
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:35,668
- It's rubbish.
- Samantha walk the fine line between ...

196
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:40,517
Romanticism and sex appeal, not fear
to dive, might be surprised.

197
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,365
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Chrissy, making your dreams ...

198
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:46,951
Before you wilt like a flower.

199
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:49,627
What am I supposed to understand?

200
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:56,335
I go on, Teeny are a magnet for sex ...

201
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,453
What attracts men of the 4 points
cardinal, relax.

202
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,817
Back for the rest of my stuff when
girls leave home

203
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:21,664
- No need to move out
- Please already went through this not work, goodbye.

204
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,422
I decided not to tell my friends about my father

205
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:22,877
Call me silly but I thought it would.

206
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:25,927
That was a wish that I had for years

207
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,155
At that time none of our city had divorced

208
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:33,847
And what I wanted was to be different from my friends.

209
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:52,905
- Well it's so cold here.
- Take my shirt, I'll have cold, but you shut up.

210
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:01,893
- It makes me look fat.
- These fat.

211
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:04,213
I'm not fat ...

212
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:07,358
Do I look fat?

213
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:11,185
Take the hand of the person who is at his side
palm to palm.

214
00:23:12,531 --> 00:23:16,441
- Contact Marilyn Monroe.
- Do not cooperated the last time.

215
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:19,878
No one ever cooperates.

216
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:24,070
Should contact someone buried
in this cemetery.

217
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:27,376
What about the dear Johnny?

218
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:31,493
DEAR JOHNNY MAY 22 1933 - October 1945 JUNE

219
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,975
Find out how he died

220
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:44,132
Close your eyes, guide to finding the spiritual world that our circle is safe from all evil and harm

221
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,338
Dear Johnny know you were a child when
let us know how you died.

222
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:56,296
- I'm here.
- Shut up! Concentrate.

223
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:06,915
Dear Johnny, did we hear? if so give us a sign

224
00:24:08,191 --> 00:24:13,008
Okay just want to talk to you tell us how you died

225
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:16,065
This here ...

226
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:26,817
- Says he wants to tell his story.
- Chrissy.

227
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,087
I think we should stop.

228
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:31,224
Afraid

229
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,058
Tell him not to be afraid, it's all good.

230
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:41,405
This alone is very lonely, you need a friend.

231
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,676
The fool

232
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:59,276
- Oh it hurts.
- You deserve it and if you're fat.

233
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,154
Do not do it again.

234
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:08,001
Sorry ladies but they are so innocent about
these things, ie everything is fake.

235
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:16,315
Chrissy! Where you going?
Somebody stop it!

236
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:20,277
- Chrissy, back!
- Chrissy!

237
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:26,341
Let Sam!

238
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:37,285
- Sam, let's go from here.
- Look, there's someone else here, Look there!

239
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:42,979
- Perhaps only the wind better let's go.
- Sam Let's go, let's go!

240
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:53,483
Roberta, What are you doing? Why can not act
as a child?

241
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:56,565
Look what you've done.

242
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:57,501
What?

243
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,883
You know I hate getting dirty

244
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:01,136
It's nothing

245
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:05,481
The crazy Pette.

246
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:15,234
- Let's cut way.
- Let's go.

247
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:06,294
Base Chrissy, Chrissy basis,
Are you listening?, Change.

248
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:07,991
What?

249
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:10,543
We need to meet.

250
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,648
Now?

251
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:19,646
Remember I saw someone after the meeting?
I think it was in my room.

252
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,868
- Who?
- Dear Johnny.

253
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:28,806
Please, this was a bad idea
not a good idea

254
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:33,189
- Shut up Chrissy! I do not want your complaints now.
- Likewise.

255
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:37,472
Sam!, Are you okay?

256
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:44,503
- Oh my God.
- We did indeed make it.

257
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:49,270
He's back, we call it.

258
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:02,910
There's nothing about dear Johnny,
documents before 1948 were lost ...

259
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:08,322
In a fire, but Ms. Wendy Greenfield says the library has a copy of every newspaper in the county.

260
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:11,937
- That settles it.
- What do you manage?

261
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,387
We can not go by bicycle to Greenfield.

262
00:29:17,607 --> 00:29:18,327
Or do you?

263
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,611
- Truth or Dare, Roberta?
- Truth

264
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,379
What size are your breasts?

265
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:22,349
Die

266
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,683
Have to say Is not Sam?

267
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:28,262
There has to say unless you want.

268
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:31,325
- Can we see them?
- No! They can not see them.

269
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:34,282
- And yours grow?
- Although I have not really.

270
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,256
The will, and hate.

271
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:44,403
No, you're lucky Roberta men like
great look at the size of mine.

272
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:47,347
They almost look real

273
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,147
Fill them with pudding.

274
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,314
"Pudding?

275
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:54,172
Worms gave me the idea

276
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:56,586
Gelatin is moving much

277
00:30:57,174 --> 00:31:00,044
The pudding has a better texture

278
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:02,402
What flavor is it?

279
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,838
Vanilla.

280
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:10,060
- Chrissy, "Truth or Dare?
- Truth

281
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:12,982
Have you been given a French kiss?

282
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:16,424
Are you kidding? I do not get pregnant!

283
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:18,609
No one gets pregnant by a kiss.

284
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:24,439
I know, insect brain but everyone knows
that if you kiss and ...

285
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:30,238
... Automatically think you'll do with it, can not help it, they are driven, is his curse

286
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:33,697
"And what kind of relationship do you mean?

287
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,040
You know ... put the seed and watering the flower

288
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:48,882
What? Does not work that way?, Man carries
your hose and spray the flowers.

289
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:33,356
- I think it's time to rest.
- But we must come before lunch.

290
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:36,317
- We continued Chrissy.
- Well, go away, leave me here.

291
00:32:36,317 --> 00:32:38,787
- Chrissy!
- I do not care I want to rest

292
00:32:41,415 --> 00:32:42,745
Wait, listen, shut it.

293
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:46,259
It's beautiful

294
00:32:46,854 --> 00:32:47,766
Wow.

295
00:32:52,592 --> 00:32:55,460
- Where did it fall?
- Do not know.

296
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:04,949
What?

297
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,104
What?

298
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,583
Is in your hair

299
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:10,586
Quítenmelo!

300
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:21,004
This thin

301
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,530
Chrissy Calm

302
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,984
Watch below!

303
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,022
Roberta! There is deep

304
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:09,214
Where does he go?

305
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:12,002
Roberta!

306
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:14,998
Roberta!

307
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,663
Oh God

308
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:18,288
Roberta!

309
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:20,625
No!

310
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:26,672
Roberta!

311
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:27,813
Roberta!

312
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:43,903
Roberta!

313
00:34:51,146 --> 00:34:52,047
You have to remove it.

314
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:57,904
- Stop breathing!
- Give him mouth to mouth

315
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:00,832
- You do, I will rise again.
- No, the opposite!

316
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,741
Take off!

317
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:06,534
Please Roberta.

318
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:14,132
Go! It's good to know my friends.

319
00:35:14,538 --> 00:35:18,196
- Do you know? I thought it
- I, too, Roberta.

320
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:21,924
If clear Chrissy is the only one who cares about that ...

321
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:23,487
Chrissy!

322
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:30,308
- Never again will you make us something to happen, never!
- It was a joke

323
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,181
It was the first time that Roberta faked his death,
Earlier that year, we scared to jump off the roof ...

324
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:47,146
And pretend that he had broken his neck, had no
experienced a loss like Roberta ...

325
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:51,452
And we did not understand his jokes, but I wanted to
death seem funny ...

326
00:35:51,728 --> 00:35:53,739
Perhaps to make it easier for her.

327
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,305
What was that?

328
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:12,222
Sorry, if it means anything to you really
thank you for trying to save.

329
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:16,600
- But it scared me.
- Sorry

330
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,982
Roberta, you're my best friend

331
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:28,307
If you have strength Chriss, Curse.

332
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:33,780
Roberta, do not curse.

333
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:37,682
Hey, check this out!

334
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:54,426
- Oh my God!
- What?

335
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,539
- I saw his penis.
- Who?

336
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,327
- And his balls.
- Who?

337
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,622
Scott.

338
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:10,684
Oh my God!

339
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:19,034
Of course, now I'm the one who has not seen Scott's team
which as will be the talk of the summer

340
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:23,129
- I was forced to watch.
- Chrissy nobody is forcing anything.

341
00:37:23,414 --> 00:37:27,856
I have to look at but let me be very clear
I see under protest.

342
00:37:28,432 --> 00:37:30,094
If course!

343
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,667
It is not very large.

344
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:52,883
- What are you laughing?
- Do you know? is not large, only when you have an erection.

345
00:37:55,448 --> 00:38:00,158
- When that happens it is of this size.
- What is erection?

346
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:02,735
Your mother has not told you anything?

347
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:05,951
Beginning to believe my mom is ill-informed.

348
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:07,798
Hey girls.

349
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:11,171

350
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:15,519
Friends get ready to run.

351
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:20,346
- If you will be better than you get ahead
- Do not send me an insect brain

00:38:20,862 --> 00:38:23,004

Return the clothes

360
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,453

00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:24,012
I think I'm allergic to dust.

367
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,517
Nothing happened in April

368
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,491
- Nothing ever happens here.
- I prefer it that way

369
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:36,481
Nothing

370
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:56,362
COMMUNITY TEACHER DIES IN CRASH.

371
00:40:57,904 --> 00:40:58,843
What happens?

372
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:01,969
It's Mom

373
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:16,451
It was a collision, the driver of the truck
fell asleep at the wheel ...

374
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:22,244
Was stuck in the car for an hour and a half
before the rescue ...

375
00:41:22,843 --> 00:41:28,133
He was conscious as rescuers worked
out of its vehicle ...

376
00:41:29,382 --> 00:41:34,571
He died that night at the county hospital of massive blows to the head and massive bleeding.

377
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,514
- I do not understand, there is something wrong.
- What are you talking?

378
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:46,448
It must have been horrible, felt pain.

379
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:53,044
She was very beautiful

380
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:57,141
It was a movie star.

00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:02,941
- Hey, I think I found something
- Read it

382
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:10,418
On Saturday, funeral services were made to Jonathan Simmons 12 years and mother aged 36

383
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:18,881
Due to the tragic circumstances that led to his
death in the family has requested that the services are private

384
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:30,940
- It's all, nothing more
- How is everything? How did he die?

385
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,115
Wait ...

386
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:39,931
The pages were torn

387
00:43:43,214 --> 00:43:47,923
Someone took the time to keep his death a mystery.

388
00:44:01,063 --> 00:44:01,933
Hello

389
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:03,846
Hello

390
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:06,827
Are you in the army?

391
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:10,950
I

392
00:44:11,337 --> 00:44:12,521
"In Vietnam?

393
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:16,804
I

394
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:19,098
Did you kill anyone?

395
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:24,911
Not because he wanted

396
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:27,921
Are you injured?

397
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:32,840
Hey this is a great song

398
00:44:33,655 --> 00:44:35,117
Does it hurt your leg?

399
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:39,804
If it hurts too much

400
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:44,386
You know get that bullet was the best thing that could happen.

401
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,122
What are you talking?

402
00:44:47,939 --> 00:44:49,605
Well I got a ticket back home

403
00:44:51,402 --> 00:44:52,766
But are we not winning?

404
00:44:54,076 --> 00:44:55,412
Nobody won

405
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:01,069
Want some?

406
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:16,728
Thank you, Smoke?
- If

407
00:45:17,852 --> 00:45:19,259
I love smoking

408
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:24,976
Smoking stops the growth

409
00:45:31,045 --> 00:45:32,402
It is soft

410
00:45:40,777 --> 00:45:42,353
Have you got the heart of honor?

411
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:43,982
If

412
00:45:45,191 --> 00:45:46,831
Why not use it?

413
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,442
If this is a great honor it?

414
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:51,857
No

415
00:45:55,901 --> 00:45:59,117
In the news says we are winning
ground in Vietnam

416
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:05,191
Forget it OK? forget what they say, forget what they see.

417
00:46:06,854 --> 00:46:11,372
Those who were there lie to say that they saw
or what they did

418
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:14,918
Do not think much about them I think.

419
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,528
You can believe in

420
00:46:19,658 --> 00:46:20,748
If they are lucky ...

421
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,857
Will you stay here long?

422
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:33,428
No, I do not like to spend much time anywhere
You know what I mean?

423
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,942
- Yeah right
"Yes definitely

424
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:41,225
- Is that an earring?
- If

425
00:46:43,196 --> 00:46:44,728
- Are you a hippie then, right?

426
00:46:46,022 --> 00:46:47,133
You're amazing

427
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:50,663
Mom says all hippies seeking sex

428
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:57,811
I'll tell you that he wished

429
00:46:58,091 --> 00:47:00,763
- What else?
- That the parents deceive

430
00:47:01,562 --> 00:47:02,685
Really?

431
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:11,309

- Goodbye

432
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:15,192
