[Bobby and Whitney laughing]

198
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,928
Bobby: Man,
I-i-it's amazing.
What is?

199
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,797
How much they love you.
It's great.
[Groans]

200
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,766
Sometimes I wish they'd love me
just a little bit less.

201
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,701
Please.
No, you don't.

202
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,703
Come on, seriously,
you got to be digging this.

203
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,238
What I don't dig
is people thinking

204
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,373
They know everything about me
when they don't.

205
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,242
Sure, but you don't want them
to forget about you, either.

206
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,376
Hey!

207
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,711
Eh, I guess not.

208
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,246
See? So it's worth it.

209
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,248
Come on.
Look around. Look where we are.

210
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,717
We are in
Beverly hills, baby!

211
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,852
Rodeo drive!

212
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,687
Hey, hey, hey, who...

213
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,956
Which one of y'all want a
picture with Bobby brown, huh?

214
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,858
Come on.
Come take your picture, girl.

215
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,726
Get your picture.
[Camera shutters clicking]

216

[Laughs]

217
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,765
Oh, thank you!

218
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,633
Thank you so much!
I can't believe this!
Yeah, thank you.

219
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,134
Oh!
How about one with Whitney, too?

220
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,171
What you say?

221
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,240
Show 'em maybe they don't know
you after all? Hmm?

* hey, I'll be right here
with you, make you wait *

224
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,315
You are amazing.
I love you so much.
Bye!

225
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,851
Bye! Bye! Bye!
Bye! Bye! Bye!

226
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:20,721
Bobby:
Go buy that album!

227
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:21,889
Hi!

228
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,724
I didn't think
you'd make it.

229
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,759
I know.
Wheels up at 7:00.

230
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,194
Don't worry. I'm here.

231
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,897
[Sighs]

232
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,398
You didn't
have to do that.

233
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,167
I wanted to.

234
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,836
So, how was Bobby?

235
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,738
[Sighs] Nice.

236
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:38,906
He's funny.

237
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,741
Come on.
Open your present.

238
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,413
Oh, fine.

239
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,281
[Laughs]

240
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,717
Shut up.

241
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,921
Wow!

242
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,223
[Chuckles]
Thank you.

243
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,324
You're welcome.

244
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,792
Mm.

[Sighs]

246
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,430
I'm glad
to be going home.

[Upbeat music

Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

Tell mama what Michael got you
for your birthday. Ohh!

268
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,268
Yeah. Mommy, a monkey.
[Laughter]

269
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,304
I'm like,
"what am I gonna do with that?!"

than just a feeling, baby *

You made it!

277
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,861
Hi! I'm so glad.

278
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,429
Yeah, well, I was
in the neighborhood, you know.

280
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,065
Nah, truth is, I flew up
from Atlanta to be here.

281
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,800
Happy Birthday.

282
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,901
That's so sweet.

283
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,137
This place is huge.

284
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,905
Please tell me you don't
live here by yourself.

285
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,373
No, robyn lives with me.

290
00:12:58,846 --> 00:12:59,913
She's my best friend
since I was 16.

291
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,314
She runs my businesses.

292
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,416
Hey, how you doing?
Great party, darling.

293
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,918
Thanks for coming.

294
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,453
Hey, hey. Good to see you.
Happy Birthday, baby.

295
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,888
Anyway, we just moved in.

296
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,923
Been building it
for a while, and...

297
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,591
I bet you don't know
half of what's here.

298
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,461
I know I have a movie theater
and a recording studio and...

299
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,996
Woman: Now, you know I'm coming
to get a hug, girl!
Hey!

300
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,330
How you doing, girl?

301
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,833
Thanks for coming.
Happy Birthday.

302
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,068
You want a tour?

303
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,004
Man:
Happy Birthday, Whitney!

304
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,039
* you have just what I need

305
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,576
Hey.
Keep the party going.

306
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,578
* you... you...

307
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,846
* ohhhh

308
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,614
* you got that

309
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,184
* he-e-e-y

310
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,852
Wow!

311
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,553
I may have taken home the award
the night we met.

312
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,622
Looks like you robbed
the whole damn store.

313
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:47,094
Yeah, kind of an embarrassment
of riches, I guess.

314
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,932
Great setup.
[Sniffs] Yeah. Here.

315
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,400
Nah, I don't do that.

316
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,902
Really? Bobby brown?

317
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,569
[Chuckles] Look,
I'm not sayin' I don't party,

318
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,271
But I'd seen
too many bad outcomes,

319
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,639
And I worked too hard
to get where I am.

320
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,574
[Sniffs]
It's just for fun.

321
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,376
Come on.

322
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,112
Thanks.
I'll stick with this.

323
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,982
This is giving me a lot of ideas
for the studio I'm building.

324
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,217
[Gasps] That's right.

325
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,651
I heard you write
your own stuff.

326
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,353
Oh, I'd like
to do that someday.
Girl, why not?

327
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,587
You should never get
so big,

328
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,256
You can't mess around
with what you love.

329
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,657
Maybe we'll
write something together.

330
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,626
[Both chuckle]

331
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,528
Oh, you probably get people
saying that to you all the time.

332
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,463
No.

333
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:26,399
What I mostly get is songwriters
saying "sing my song."

334
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,235
Well, the way you belt it out,
yeah, "sing my song!"

335
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,404
Well, I get that
from this lady right here.

336
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,041
Mommy taught me pretty much
everything I know.

337
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,408
She was my choir director.

338
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,911
Oh, yeah, I been there.
What, you sang choir?

339
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,546
Since I was 3.
[Laughing] What?

340
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,049
Saw James brown singing gospel,
and after that, I was hooked.

341
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,451
But, you know,
teaching only goes so far.

342
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,420
It's you that won all this,
not your mama.

343
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,326
Hey, I bet
I must be the 100th guy

344
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,095
That's told you
how nice you look tonight.

345
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,964
Am I right?

346
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,932
Maybe a few more.

347
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,567
Well, they lied.

348
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,402
Yeah,
nice doesn't do it.

349
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,704
Up close, you're
so freakin' beautiful,

350
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,440
I can't stop
looking at you.

351
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:11,144
[Chuckles softly]

352
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,947
Most guys don't usually
follow up like that.

353
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,617
Truth is, sometimes I think
I scare men off.

354
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,452
Maybe they don't like
strong women.

355
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,588
Or maybe they just don't know
how to handle you...

356
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,957
Not like
Bobby brown would.

357
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,459
Oh, you sound
pretty sure of yourself.

358
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,195
[Chuckles]
I have to be.

359
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,063
I got no margin
for error.

360
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,065
Where I come from,
there's only two ways out...

361
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,600
Either dead or in jail.

362
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,170
I saw my best friend killed
in front of me when I was 11.

363
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,641
First thing I did
when I got some bank,

364
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,477
I bought my mama a house
in a real nice neighborhood.

365
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,548
I got a big family to take care
of, and I mean to do it.

366
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,050
Tell me about it.

367
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,120
Hold on.

368
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,089
[Chuckles]
"Sparkle"?

369
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,225
W-w-what?
You know it?

370
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,560
Hell, yeah, I know it.
It's a classic.

371
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,295
When that movie came out,
I must have seen it 20 times.

372
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,630
I mean, all the other
black movies

373
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,165
Were "super fly,"
"shaft," "the mack,"

374
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,036
And there was Irene Cara
just... Belting it out.

375
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,770
Yeah, Irene Cara.

376
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,172
She was somethin'.

377
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,507
Wasn't she?
[Chuckles]

378
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,713
What?

379
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,684
You're just
not what I expected.

380
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,255
You're not
what I expected, either.

381
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,157
Really?

382
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,724
Yeah.

383
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,062
I used to think that you were
some kind of goddess.

384
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:40,267
But now I can see
that you're way more than that.

385
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,734
I can see
that you're real.

386
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,279
Guess we should probably
head back out.

387
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,414
Your guests gonna start
to wonder where you went.

388
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,359
[Horn honks]

389
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,697
Bye-bye.

390
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,632
Hello!

391
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,800
[Chuckles]

392
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,669
How's my favorite star?
Doing good.

393
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,405
Should I get your usual
for lunch today, miss Houston?

394
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,540
Hamburger and fries.
Thank you, ruthie.

395
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,741
You got it.
[Chuckles]

396
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,311
Unh, unh, unh.
Not in my office.

397
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:29,082
Whitney, you need
to protect the voice.

398
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:32,085
And, uh...
Stay away from yellow.

399
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,820
What?
Yeah.

400
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,355
Seriously?

401
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,823
Makes you look like
a canary.

402
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,326
[Chuckles]

403
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,196
Now white...
Now, that's good for you.

404
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,366
Oh, and, by the way,

405
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,868
What's this I'm reading
about you and Eddie Murphy?

406
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,637
[Sighs]
We are just friends.

407
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,705
We went on
a couple of dates is all.

408
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,142
Anyway, there's someone else
I'm interested in now.

409
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,709
Mm?
Mm-hmm.

410
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,611
Just stay out
of my business, okay?

411
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,347
Fine. Fine.

412
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,183
So [Chuckles]
what's on your mind?

413
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,551
I want to talk about
the new album.

414
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,885
I was thinking
I'd like to give 'em

415
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,320
A little different
kind of flavor.

416
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,855
Whitney.

417
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,757
You are the greatest voice
of your generation

418
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,394
And the biggest star
on the planet.

419
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,729
I don't want to change
a winning formula.

420
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,800
Clive, you know I've always done
everything you've asked.

421
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,802
Now I'd like
to express myself

422
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,337
A little more
in the music.

423
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,206
I think my audience
can handle it,

424
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,375
And I know some of 'em
are looking for something new.

425
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,380
I tell you what.

426
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,915
I just brought a new team
into the arista family...

427
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,385
L.A. reid and babyface.

428
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,187
Maybe they can work
on the new album.

429
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,921
Those are the guys
that did Bobby brown's, right?

430
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,690
Exactly.
Yes! All right.

431
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,258
That's... that's
the flavor, right?

432
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,593
All right, yes, the flavor.
[Laughs]

433
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,395
You're a very sharp
young lady.

434
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,762
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

435
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,897
In my canary yellow?

436
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,932
Eh, I forgive the yellow
for the face.

437
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,167
Oh, oh, okay.

438
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,668
[Both laugh]

439
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,173
Oh, my God.

440
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,709
When I was a kid,
all I wanted to do was sing.

441
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,511
You know, I used to hide out
in the basement

442
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,313
And dressed up
in my mommy's gowns

443
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,914
And sing along to a record

444
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,350
Pretending I was
my cousin dionne or aretha

445
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,751
Or Gladys
or something like that.

446
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,686
And daddy would be
pounding on the floor

447
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,356
Screaming at mommy,
"can't you stop that noise?!"

448
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,691
And that's when she made me
go sing in church.

449
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,493
She said,
"if you can do it for Gladys,

450
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,295
You can do it for the lord."
[Laughs]

451
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,563
I used to dance
to Michael.

452
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,365
I used to put glitter
all over my sneakers.

453
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,833
I put so much on,

454
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,401
You couldn't even tell
what brand they were.

455
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,702
[Both laugh]

456
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,304
My mom
used to get so mad.

457
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,772
She'd say,
"Robert barisford brown, boy,

458
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,208
Now I know them ain't the shoes
I bought you last week."

459
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,476
Okay. [Laughs]

460
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,977
But I thought
I was pretty fly.

461
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,447
You're still pretty fly.

462
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,450
It's easy
to talk to you.

463
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,985
You too.

464
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,256
All right.

465
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,390
Break it to me gently.

466
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,860
I heard you have kids.

467
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,928
[Chuckles] Two.

468
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,897
I love 'em.

469
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,000
And I take care of
my responsibilities for 'em.

470
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,472
But back then,
I had no idea what I wanted.

471
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:09,309
A case of the big head being led
by the little one, I guess.

472
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,910
Where are they now?

473
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,280
Boston.
With their moms.

474
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,848
I go see 'em,
spend time with 'em.

475
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,751
I never want 'em
not to be in my life.

476
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,520
They mean everything to me.

477
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,822
And I need
to do right by 'em.

478
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,427
That scare you off?

479
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,463
You see me running?

480
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,499
[Lennox buppy brown's
"she's hot" playing]

481
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,801
She's on fire!

482
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,970
Yeah! And oba simba and buppy
come to call around.

483
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,773

Man:
But behind the voice of soul

510
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,985
Lies a heart of gold.

511
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:02,121
Whitney's many humanitarian
efforts and contributions

512
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,391
Have helped countless people
in need.

513
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,526
We realize that we're
in the presence

514
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,461
Of someone truly special.

515
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,329
You can say that again.

516
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,468
Hi, I'm Eddie Murphy.

517
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,405
I'm here on the set of my
new picture, "another 48 hrs.,"

518
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,007
And I had to take time to
congratulate you, Whitney,

519
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,476
For being the recipient of the
Frederick d. Patterson award,

520
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,977
And for all
the beautiful things

521
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,946
You've done for
the united negro college fund.

522
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:31,751
Also some personal things, too,
I've wanted to say

523
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,553
And a lot of things
I wanted to do

524
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,155
But never got the chance.

525
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,957
So, on a night like tonight,

526
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,726
I wanted to do them
in the presence of everyone.

527
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,162
So if you could just walk
up to the screen?

528
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,697
I'll wait.

529
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,599
[Laughter]

530
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:49,936
[Applause]

531
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:50,937
Come on.

532
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:03,049
I just want to kiss you, baby.
[Laughs]

533
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,384
[Laughter]

534
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,635
[Chuckles]

535
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:25,104
I swear I didn't know
he was gonna do that.

536
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,673
Nah, it's no problem.

537
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,676
Oh, my God.
You're jealous.

538
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,678
No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are.

539
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,580
Why the hell
would I be jealous?

540
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,483
Oh, don't be like that.
I think it's cute.

541
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,686
Be serious. I got girls, okay...
Any girl I want.

542
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,521
Eddie Murphy
wishes he was me.

543
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,990
[Mockingly] Oh, I got girls.
Any girl I want. [Laughs]

544
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,692
You better watch out.
I'm serious.

545
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,561
Oh, yeah? Or what?
What you gonna do?

546
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,029
I'll do whatever.

547
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,964
Oh, yeah?
I'd like to see you try.

548
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,566
I'm really
gonna get you, then!

549
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,001
Not if I get you first!

550
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,236
You're not gonna get nobody.
I'm gonna get you first.

551
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,105
[Laughs]
I'm not even ticklish.

552
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,239
[Laughs]

553
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,508
Yeah, you are, right here.

554
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,609
And right here.

555
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,210
What about... ohh!
Ohh!

556
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,778
[Laughs]

557
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,547
[Sighs]

558
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,781
Damn.

559
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,050
Oh, God.
I can't keep up with you.

560
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,252
Mm, baby, you don't have to.
Just let me do all the work.

561
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,254
[Both laugh]

562
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,590
Mm.

563
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:18,591
Bobby...
[Chuckles]

564
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,192
[Sighs]

565
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,994
Oh, come on.
I got to get my rest.

566
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,496
I got to be up early.

567
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,164
I just can't help myself
around you.

568
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,266
You're just
so damn beautiful.

569
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,136
And thinking of all them guys
who would kill to be who I am,

570
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:33,239
Baby, I just get so damn horny,
I just [Chuckles]

571
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:35,675
Is that
what this is about?

572
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,577
Oh, hell, no.

573
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,846
Before I met you, I didn't
even know I could feel this way.

574
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,147
Mm.

575
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,616
What do you say, hmm?
Hmm?

576
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,117
You and me?
Hmm?

577
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,087
Let's move and make this
more permanent.

578
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,038
Didn't you hear
what I said?

579
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,846
I-I can't, Bobby.
I'm sorry.

580
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,181
I thought
we were getting serious.

581
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,916
Yeah, we are.
Then I don't get it.

582
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,184
It's just...
It's just happening so fast.

583
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,819
This is
all new to me.

584
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,721
So what are you saying,
you want to see other guys?

585
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,089
No. I just...

586
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,058
I-I don't know
how to be sure this is real.

587
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,994
You don't think
my feelings for you are real?

588
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,829
Bobby, no,
it's not about you.

589
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,297
It's me.

590
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,567
[Sighs]

591
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:40,607
When I was 15,
mommy put me in this...

592
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,208
This catholic girls' school,

593
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:46,679
And I was so shy and those girls
were so cruel to me.

594
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:50,783
In all those years,
I only made one friend... robyn.

595
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:54,954
It just... it takes me
a long time to,

596
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,825
You know, to give
that kind of trust.

597
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,260
I just thought we could keep
this casual, you know,

598
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,862
For a while longer.

599
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,931
Yeah?
Yeah.

600
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,169
Well, I got
a problem with that.

601
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,570
Hmm?

602
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,342
I love you too much.

603
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,244
[Sighs]

604
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,146
Bobby...

605
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,616
Wha... Bobby?
[Chuckling] Come back to bed.

606
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,051
Bobby, come on.

607
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,720
I'm not playing games
with you.

608
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,723
I love you. Straight up.

609
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:34,126
If you don't feel the same,
this ain't gonna work.

610
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,662
[Keys jingling]

611
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,596
Bobby, wh...

Wow! Wow!

677
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,981
I never thought our stuff
could sound that good.

678
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,515
You really do have
the magic voice.

679
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,918
Thank you.
[Giggles]

680
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,619
I like to
come out kickin'!

681
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,488
Yeah. Yeah.
[Laughs]

682
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,156
So, clive says you're
the writer of the team.

683
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,958
Yeah, yeah.

684
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,093
I-I write
a lot of the stuff.

685
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,095
You are lucky.

686
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,897
Why's that?

687
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,565
Just to be able
to express yourself this way.

688
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,234
I owe it to love.

689
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:37,503
Really?

690
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,938
Yeah.

691
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:42,508
Growing up,
I was always in love.

692
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,377
But I was just too shy
to ever tell anyone.

693
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:49,215
And when I tried to,
I'd just... Freeze up.

694
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,651
So, somehow, writing it
in a song opened me up.

695
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,921
Yeah, that...
That's exactly how I feel.

696
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,957
It's only onstage I can really
let go and be myself.

697
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,358
Yeah.
[Chuckles] Yeah.

698
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,928
It's a crazy business.
And we're all crazy in it.

699
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,930
Mm-hmm.
[Both laugh]

700
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,498
So, uh, what do you say?

pretty well, don't you?

Yeah.

705
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,546
What was he like
when you first met him?

you could see

709

That there was
another side to him.

710
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,391
He was smart, warm.

711
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,460
He just needed to find
a way to express himself.

712
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:35,928
I mean,
don't get me wrong.

713
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:37,296
He's crazy
like the rest of us,

714

he's a good person.

Mm-hmm.

00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:34,606
It is.

881
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,077
I spent my life trying to keep
you and your brothers

882
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,646
Out of the projects.

883
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,514
Now you marrying
into them?

884
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:43,615
He's not in them anymore.

885
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:45,451
Don't believe it.

886
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:46,918
You can take the boy
out the ghetto,

887
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:48,454
But not the ghetto
out the boy.

888
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,522
Nippy, he's got kids.

889
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,524
Yeah, by
two different women.

890
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:54,526
And he's a good father
to them.

891
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,529
And the point is,
we love each other very much.

892
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:58,897
And I don't want anything

893
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,032
To stand in the way
of our happiness.

894
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,968
I thought y'all
would be happy for me.

895
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:06,505
Whitney, this is not right,
and I think you know that.

896
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:07,973
You've always been
stubborn,

897
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,941
But now you're
only hurting yourself.

898
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:12,077
You already had Gary
when daddy married you.

899
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,945
That was different,
and you know it was.

900
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,982
Why is it always different
when it comes to me?

901
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,116
Whitney!

902
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,651
Nippy!

903
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,086
Where were you?
Are you happy now?

904
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,688
Oh, am I happy now?
You do this all the time.

905
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,456
Where were you?
You're head of security.

906
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,057
All right, all right,
all right.

907
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,460
Just take it easy.
We'll figure this out.

908
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:29,595
She's still our baby.

909
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,497
Michael:
Nice, mom. Real nice.

910
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:35,501
[Door unlocks]

911
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,574
[Gasps] Hey, baby.

912
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,810
Why you sittin'
in the dark?

913
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:50,582
What's wrong, Bobby?

914
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,518
Hmm?

915
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:53,985
What is it?

916
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,186
She pregnant.

917
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,122
Who is?

918
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,990
Kim.

919
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,595
Kim?

920
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:05,697
Baby, I can explain this.

921
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:07,733
No! I don't want
to hear this.

922
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:10,268
Whitney! Wait.
Baby, wait!

923
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,738
No! No!
Whitney!

924
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,573
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
Please!

925
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,708
No, you tell me this after
I tell my family!

926
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:18,243
I just found out,
I swear!

927
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:21,279
No, you don't need that, okay?
You have me. I'm here!

928
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,981
I don't have you.
She has you.

929
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,016
You're gonna have two kids
with her now?!

930
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,218
Look, this happened before
we got back together!
I trusted you.

931
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,720
But you have
nothing to worry about.

932
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:30,255
I'm not going back to her.
Well, you should!

933
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,757
No, listen,
I'm not going back to her.

934
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,291
That'd be unfair
to all of us.

935
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,926
Okay? I love you.
This changes nothing.

936
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,828
How can you say that?
Because it's true.

937
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:38,296
You've been with her
since you were 11.

938
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,665
You obviously
still love her.

939
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:40,766
She has no hold
on me anymore.

940
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,534
She's pregnant!

941
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:43,669
I'd say that's a hold.

942
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,170
I'll take care
of my baby, okay?

943
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,271
I always take care of my kids.
You know that!

944
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,706
[Sniffing]

945
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,641
But I ain't got to be with her
to do that.

946
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,677
Please! Listen to me!

947
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,645
I cannot stand the thought
of losing you!

948
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,581
Mnh-mnh,
Whitney, please!
Please!

949
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,315
Why? Come on. Why?

950
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,185
Bobby, don't you get it?

951
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:03,088
[Voice breaking] I wanted
to be the one to have your baby.

952
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,823
Me!

953
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,224
You will.

954
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,595
As soon as you can,
whenever you are ready.

955
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,597
I promise you she will
never come between us.

956
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,664
No one will, ever.

957
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,199
Unless we let them.

958
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:15,767
Bobby, listen to me.

959
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:17,736
I'm putting everything
on the line...

960
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,337
My career, everything.

961
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,642
For the first time,
I'm putting myself first,

962
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:27,278
And I'm choosing you.

963
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,080
I need this to be real.

964
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:33,218
It is real.

965
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,122
Forever.

966
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:40,892
I swear.

967
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,668
[Breathing deeply]

968
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,304
[Sniffles]

969
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,213
How'd last night's show go?

970
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,616
Girl, you mean tonight's show.
It's 3:00 A.M. Here.

971
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,984
I love
these Japanese people.

972
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,686
They don't come
to criticize you, you know?

973
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,255
Just to have a good time
and get they money's worth.

974
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:12,791
Oh, and Carol opening for me,
too, she knocked 'em dead.

975
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:15,126
Aww, your little sister
did good, huh?

976
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,728
Yeah, she gonna be huge.

977
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:18,263
But how's my baby doin'?

978
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,197
Baby, I am beat.

979
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,233
We worked last night till
5:00 A.M.,

980
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,702
Still got more to get.

981
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:25,136
Had to shut down for two hours
'cause there was

982
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,272
Some kind of problem
with the power in the building.

983
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,107
And I'm going into
the studio tomorrow

984
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,341
To record some more
of the album.

985
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,143
Clive thinks
"the bodyguard" soundtrack's

986
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,779
Gonna be bigger
than the movie.

987
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:36,247
Listen, you just make sure you
get yourself some rest.

988
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,917
Yeah, and Kevin's
been real good to me,

989
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:43,188
Real supportive...
And not just of the acting.

990
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,756
[Chuckles]

991
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,258
I can't imagine how beautiful
this baby's gonna be

992
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,894
With you as her mother.

993
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:50,962
Hey, you're not
bad-looking yourself.

994
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:53,665
Nothin' like you, baby.
[Chuckles]

995
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,767
Hey, you make sure you
don't do anything you're
uncomfortable with, okay?

996
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:56,902
Don't strain yourself.

997
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:59,404
I won't.
[Knock on door]

998
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:01,106
Oh, they're calling for me now.
I love you.

999
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,909
Love you, too.
Oh, hey, you remind Kevin...

1000
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,911
Hmm?
No tongue.

1001
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,412
[Chuckles]
Well, you just stay away

1002
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,180
From all those
little geishas out there.

1003
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:10,749
I don't want to hear
any rumors.

1004
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:12,918
Baby, you are
all the woman I need.

1005
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:14,185
[Knocking continues]
[Sighs]

1006
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,186
[Smooches] I love you.

1007
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,690
Come in.
[Door opens]

1008
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:20,225
Ready for you on set,
Ms. Houston.

1009
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:21,326
All right.

1010
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,332
[Gasping]

1011
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:28,767
Whoa, are you...
Are you all right?

1012
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,201
Aah.

1013
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:32,403
Ms... Ms. Houston?
We need the medic.

1014
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:35,006
We need the medic
to Ms. Houston's makeup
trailer right now.

1015
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,208
It's all right. It's all right.
Medic, what's your 20?

1016
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:39,210
I got you. I got you.
I got you.

1017
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:50,956
Nippy?!

1018
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:53,925
[Sobbing] Mommy!
Mommy, I'm in here.

1019
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:56,461
Shh. Shhhh.
[Sobbing]

1020
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,463
It's okay.

1021
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:00,365
Baby. Hey.

1022
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,767
Shh.

1023
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,202
The lord has his plans.

1024
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:07,873
When the time is right,
it will happen.

1025
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:09,240
Shh! Shh!

1026
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:24,923
Now, you drink that up.
It's chamomile.

1027
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,324
That'll be good for you.

1028
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:28,293
Thank you, mommy.

1029
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,964
[Sighs]

1030
00:45:32,998 --> 00:45:37,002
You always
come through for me.

1031
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,004
I should not have taken
this gig.

1032
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:41,406
No, that had nothing
to do with it.

1033
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,977
Maybe it was a sign.

1034
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:48,980
A chance to rethink things
a little.

1035
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:50,481
You mean
with the movie?

1036
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:53,051
No, I mean with Bobby.

1037
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,520
Mommy, you have to stop
judging him.

1038
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,522
I know trouble
when I see it.

1039
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:00,425
Mommy, you don't know Bobby,
not like he really is.

1040
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,559
I know what I know.

1041
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,163
I been around
a lot longer than you.

1042
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:08,399
Yes, and you taught me
everything I know.

1043
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,569
But I am a grown woman now,
and I'm going my own way.

1044
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,039
[Voice breaking]
I need your support.

1045
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:16,474
I love him.
He loves me.

1046
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,878
I think
you're making a mistake.

1047
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:21,947
Then you should go!

1048
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,183
If you can't accept my man,
you can't accept me!

1049
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,595
[Sighs deeply]

1050
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,330
Where is she?

1051
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:40,598
Bobby!
Bobby: Baby!

"the bodyguard"

1226
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,072
Into the biggest-selling
motion-picture soundtrack album

1227
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,707
Of all time.

1228
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,612
But... In order to do that,
Whitney needs to tour.

1229
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:18,916
And I need an ally
to convince her of that.

1230
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,986
I made a promise, clive.

1231
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,122
Oh, sure, sure. Of course.
A promise is a promise.

1232
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,925
Only... Things change.

1233
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,827
I mean, you know
the ups and downs

1234
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,462
This business
can deal you.

1235
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:32,930
Make her see reason,
Bobby.

1236
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,499
This is her time.

1237
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:36,601
Don't let it pass her by.

1238
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,870
Is this why
you wanted to see me?

1239
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:42,573
Of course. What else?

1240
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:44,141
[Chuckles]

1241
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:48,713
Look, promise me
you'll think about what I said.

1242
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:50,047
Yeah.

1243
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,483
All right. That's fair enough.
[Chuckles]

1244
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:56,687
Oh, by the way, I heard mca
is releasing a new album.

1245
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:59,624
Yeah. Well,
a compilation disc.

1246
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:01,559
Compilation disc, huh?
That's fantastic.

1247
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:02,893
Yes.

1248
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:04,028
Good for you.

1249
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,630
Mr. Davis,
your 3:30 is here.

1250
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:07,398
Oh, that's right.

1251
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:09,033
And, also, these are the proofs
for the cover art

1252
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:10,601
That Alan needs you to sign
right away.

1253
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:13,538
Oh, okay.

1254
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:15,440
One, two, or three.

1255
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,408
Yeah.

1256
00:56:17,442 --> 00:56:18,943
I'm... Not sure.

1257
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:22,413
Oh, Bobby,
thanks for stopping by

1258
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:24,582
And think about
what we talked about, okay?

1259
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:28,453
I think, uh... Two.
Two.

1260
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:32,990
* mmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

1261
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,894

00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,697
* mmmm-mm-mm

What can I get you?

1263
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,632
Give me a vodka straight up.
Man: You got it.

1264
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,933
Make it a double.
Sure.

1265
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:52,543
* little ones, to him belong

1266
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:55,646
* they are weak

1267
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,616
Give me another.
Coming up.

1268
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:02,520
* but he is strong

1269
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:08,225
* mmmm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm

1270
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:14,665

1271
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:23,741
* oh, yes, Jesus loves me

1272
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,710
* yes

1273
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:27,612
Bobby.

1274
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:30,014
Why are you so late?

1275
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:32,249
Stopped off
to get a drink.

1276
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,618
It's all good.

1277
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:35,620
So, what did clive say?

1278
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:38,255
Oh.

1279
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,725
You know. [Sighs]

1280
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:42,593
I'm locked in at mca.

1281
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:44,595
What did he want, then?

1282
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,564
For me to convince you
to go on tour,

1283
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,599
Promote
"the bodyguard" album.

1284
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:50,134
And he went to you.

1285
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,002
He's not wrong.

1286
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:55,673
It's your time,
and yo time is our time.

1287
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,708
All of ours.

1288
00:57:57,742 --> 00:58:00,044
Who's... w-who's gonna
take care of her?

1289
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:03,814
You'll be there for krissi,

1290
00:58:03,848 --> 00:58:08,085
We'll travel with you,
both of us, everywhere you go.

1291
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:09,787
What about
your next album?

1292
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,556
It's just
a compilation disc.

1293
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:13,190
It's no big deal.

1294
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:18,162
[Sighs]

1295

01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,624
Show us what you got, huh?
Yeah.

1567
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:03,860
[Chuckles]
You a married man now, huh?

1568
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:05,028
Yeah? What's that like?

1569
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:06,796
[Sighs]

1570
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,765
Not all it's cracked up to be.
That's for sure.

1571
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:10,534
Come on. You got the hottest fox
on the planet.

1572
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,068
She's a'ight.
She's a'ight?

1573
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,803
Hey!
What?

1574
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:15,004
[Indistinct conversation]

1575
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:16,773
Hey!

1576
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,542
Did they come with you?
Bobby.

1577
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:20,610
You paying
for their drinks?
Bobby!

1578
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,612
Nah, I didn't think so.
Now step off.

1579
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:23,380
Look, I didn't mean
no disrespect.

1580
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:24,814
Like hell
you didn't mean nothing!

1581
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:26,550
Yo, Bobby!
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

1582
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:27,517
Stay cool, bro!
Stay cool!
Don't tell me to stay cool!

1583
01:11:27,551 --> 01:11:28,885
Tell him to stay cool.

1584
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:31,054
Come on, man.
You all wound up, bro.

1585
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:33,357
You need to relax.
Come on.

1586
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,858
Which one you like?
Take your pick.

1587
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:40,464
Look, man, I don't mind
dreamin' about it,

1588
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:41,831
But I don't do that
no more.

1589
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:43,032
What happened
while I was in the joint, man?

1590
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:45,602
You go soft on me?
Nah.

1591
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,638
It's just
Whitney wouldn't like it.

1592
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,574
[Laughs]
Do you see her anywhere?

1593
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:52,108
I mean,
the opportunity is now.

1594
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,043
You got to do
what's right for you.

1595
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:55,845
You know,
I've hardly written anything

1596
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:57,447
Since I been with her.

1597
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,349
Oh?
It used to come easy.

1598
01:11:59,383 --> 01:12:01,885
Yeah, writer's block.
Writer's block, boy.

1599
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:04,454
Yeah, easy. I got something
that make it come easy.

1600
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:06,590
Here, got a little snow
for you.

1601
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:10,527
I got just the cure.
Mm-hmm.

1602
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,396
Me first.
Me first, bro.

1603
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:13,597

[Laughs]

1605
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:17,434
Go on. Get you some.
Yeah.

1606
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:18,835
[Both sniff]

1607
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:20,870
Matter of fact,
get you two.

1608
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:22,572
And I'll take the fourth.

1609
01:12:22,606 --> 01:12:24,908
You got to stay
with your roots, boy.

1610
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:27,076
Got to stay with your roots.
That's where the fire is.

1611
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,144
Yeah!
Yeah!

1612
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,746
Yeah.

Yeah, screw... screw reid!
Screw reid, huh?

01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:36,986
There you go! There you go!
That's the Bobby I grew up with!

1616
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,522
Yeah. Okay.

1617
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:40,990
What's up?
[Laughs]

1618
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,892
That's my boy.
That's my boy.

1619
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:45,495
You home now!
This is what
I needed tonight.

1620
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:46,930
You home now.
Yeah.

1621
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:48,432
Hey, you gonna save some

1622
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:50,667
Slow down with it.
Slow down with it.

1623
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,636
Yeah, yeah,

Yes, me like.
[Laughs]

1625

As a matter of fact,

1626
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:57,574
Come on up here
with that sweet Booty.

1627
01:12:57,607 --> 01:13:00,009
She doing Bobby.
Yeah.

1628
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:01,511
Mm-hmm.

1629
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:03,179
That's so great, Bobby.

1630
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,514
I knew he would.

1631
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:06,450
Yeah, okay, I love you.

1632
01:13:06,483 --> 01:13:07,617
Good news, honey?

Bobby's going
to meet with L.A. reid

1634

To talk about a new album.
[Gasps]

1635
01:13:11,755 --> 01:13:12,922
Aunt bae,
I want to use the break

1636
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:14,991
To go to Los Angeles
and surprise Bobby.

[Chuckles]

1638
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,661
Please, can you keep krissi
for a few days?

1639
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:19,496
Of course.
I'm happy for Bobby.

1640
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:20,930
Oh, good, yay!

01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:22,666
[Singsong voice]
Mommy's going to see daddy.

1642
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:24,934
And she's gonna tell him
how much we love him

1643
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:27,504
And how much we miss him,
okay?

01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:30,106
Yay!
Woman: God ain't no plaything!

1645
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,009
[Man and woman moaning]
Every knee shall bow
and every tongue confess.

1646
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,944
You want to succeed in life?

1647
01:13:34,978 --> 01:13:37,681
He said the kingdom of God
suffers violence,

1648
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:39,916
And the violent
take it by force!

1649
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:42,085
When you gonna pick up
your weapon?

1650
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,087
You need to
get your mind right!

1651
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,556
The battlefield is the mind.

1652
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,224
You and Satan play,

1653
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,993
He'll get you doing
any old thing.

1654
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:52,028
We all got issues,

1655
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:53,897
But if you don't deal with them
privately...
[Gasping]

1656
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,699
You will deal with them
publicly.

1657
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:57,601
Get your mind right!
Whitney!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1658
01:13:57,634 --> 01:13:59,469
You need Jesus!
Whitney, baby, wait!

1659
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:01,738
You know you need Jesus!
Whitney!

1660
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:04,240
Whitney! Whitney!

[Clapping]

1662
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,243
Come on, get up.

1663
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,479
Get up. Come on, girl.
Get yourself together.

1664
01:14:09,513 --> 01:14:10,680
I don't want to.

1665
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:12,115
You can't hide in here
forever.

1666
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:16,219
And you cannot cancel
any more shows.

1667
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:21,591
Come on, nippy.
You need to end this.

1668
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:22,726
You need to leave Bobby.

1669
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:24,093
I don't want to
talk about this.

1670
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,729
Look, I'm not saying
he's a bad guy,

1671
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:27,797
But he's not right
for you.

1672
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:29,733
End it
before it destroys you both.

1673
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:32,268
Listen,
you get back on tour.

1674
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,837
By the time
you get back here,

1675
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,739
I will make sure
he's out of your house.

1676
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:37,641
Bobby: Whitney! Whitney!
I can't see him!

1677
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:39,075
Don't worry.
I'll take care of him.

1678
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:40,143
Whitney! Whitney!

1679
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:41,778
She don't want to see you,
Bobby.

1680
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,747
Look, you handle her
business affairs, that's fine.

1681
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,281
But you're not a part
of this marriage.

1682
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,983
You ain't nothing
but a punk, Bobby.

1683
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,217
You better move
out my face!

1684
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:50,153
Whitney!

1685
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:52,188
What the hell
is her problem?
She cares about me, Bobby.

1686
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:53,857
Oh, and I don't?
What do you want?
Why are you even here?

1687
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,191
You know why I'm here!
I love you!

1688
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,694
What I saw didn't look like
any kind of love I know.

1689
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,162
Look, look, I get depressed,
I drink too much,

1690
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,797
And when I do,
I lose it.

1691
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,799
You don't know what that's like!
You are Whitney Houston.

1692
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,200
What?!
Biggest damn star
in the world!

1693
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:06,269
And every time I'm with you,
I'm reminded of it!

1694
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:07,771
Oh, so I'm the problem?!
I'm not... I'm not...

1695
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:09,739
I'm not saying that...
Yes, you are!

1696
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:12,141
Look, we can work this out!
How, Bobby? How? How?

1697
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:13,777
Well, I said I'm sorry!
How?!

1698
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,111
I just
don't want to lose you!

1699
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,580
Oh, you should have
thought about that before!

1700
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:17,781
Baby!
Go away!

1701
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:19,282
Whitney, open this door!

1702
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:21,284
[Banging on door]
Open the door, Whitney!

1703
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:22,752
Whitney! Open the door!

1704
01:15:22,786 --> 01:15:24,654
[Banging continues]
Whitney!

1705
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:26,656
Whitney, open this door!

1706
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,558
Baby, open this door!

1707
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:29,826
Open this door!

1708
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,228
Baby, please!
Open this door!

1709
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:37,266
I can't go nowhere
without her being on my case.

1710
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:39,936
You don't need that, bro.

1711
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,571
You damn straight I don't.
You need that.

1712
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:45,074
* said, give it, give it,
give it to me *

1713

* here it comes, here it comes,
here it comes *

1714
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:49,178
* I'm a sweet thing
and I know you want some *

1715
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,715
* the way my body moves
to the rhythm of the drums *

1716
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:53,349
* got you realizin'

1717
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,318
Yo! Yo, shot.

1718
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,587
What you want, man?
My money, fool.

1719
01:15:57,621 --> 01:15:59,723
What's your problem?
You don't see us talking?!

1720
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:01,858
Who this punk ass?
I'm Bobby brown.

1721
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:04,694
Yeah, well, stay out of my face,
Bobby brown.

1722
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:06,095
Where's my money, man?

1723
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:08,097
I paid what I owed, man.
Nah, nah.

1724
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:11,234
The price was a "g" a bag,
and we fronted you eight.
It was only six.

1725
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:13,637
That's not
what my boy said.
Well, somebody lying.

1726
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,672
And it ain't my boy,
so you need to step off!
Oh, yeah? You want to go?

1727
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:16,773
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1728
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:18,107
[Grunts]

1729
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:22,111
Stay cool,
and you'll get your money!

1730
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:24,814
Get up, looking all weak.
[Laughs]
