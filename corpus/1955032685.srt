1
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,929
Hello. I'm Mr. Williams.
Thank you for coming.

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,640
Please. And you are?

3
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,768
- Fred Miller.
- You must be...?

4
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,603
Wallace. James Wallace.

5
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,647
Great. Please. Have a seat.

6
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,445
Now, before we do anything else,
allow me to pay you.

7
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,364
Please check that both names
are spelled correctly.

8
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,826
You understand that this is yours
simply for coming to the lab.

9
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,871
From now on, no matter what happens,
the money is yours.

10
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,664
I'll have to have you sign a receipt.

11
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,710
There you go.
Now, psychologists have developed

12
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,296
several theories on how humans learn.

13
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,673
Uh, for example, it might help
to reward a person.

14
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,425
Sometimes it helps to punish them.

15
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,886
We do know that punishment...
Thank you very much.

16
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,597
...is a powerful incentive
towards learning.

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,557
For example,
when a parent spanks a child.

18
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,807
However, in fact, we actually know
very little about

19
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,021
the effect of punishment on learning,
because almost no scientific studies

20
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,315
have been done of it on human beings.

21
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,611
Now, one of you will play
the role of learner,

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,099
who will receive a mild
punishment

23
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,907
if he answers incorrectly
to a series of questions.

24
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,576
That punishment will be
administered by a teacher.

25
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,621
What kind of punishment
are we talking about?

26
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,873
Well, first, let's determine
which of you

27
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,042
will be learner and which
will be teacher.

28
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,378
If you'll just choose one.

29
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,713
Good.

30
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,134
Teacher.

31
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,052
I guess I'm the learner, huh?

32
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,846
Good.

33
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,559
This is the machine for
generating electric shocks.

34
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,727
Go ahead.

35
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,431
Now, let's set up the learner
to receive some punishment.

36
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,247
If you'll just follow me
into the next room.

37
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,573
- Is it okay if I leave my hat here?
- Yes, that's fine.

38
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,119
Now, you might wanna
remove the jacket.

39
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,663
Go ahead and have a seat.

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,584
Now, when you push one of
these four buttons,

41
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,836
this box will signal
a light in the other room,

42
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,088
telling the teacher how you're
responding to the questions.

43
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,048
What kind of questions?

44
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,216
Multiple choice.

45
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,179
Word pairs. "Strong arm",
"black curtain", and so forth.

46
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,222
Now, we want you to memorize them.

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,017
The teacher will first read them
as word pairs,

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,353
"strong arm", for example,
then he'll read only the first word,

49
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,981
"strong", followed by
a series of word choices.

50
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,817
"Back, arm, branch, and push".

51
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,403
Your job is to remember
which of those words

52
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,611
was originally paired with
the first word, "strong".

53
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,948
- Arm.
- Right.

54
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,951
Now you would indicate that by
pushing one of these buttons here.

55
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,662
If you had thought it was the
first word I had read, "back",

56
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,331
you'd push this first button here.

57
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,458
If you thought it was
the second word, "arm",

58
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,752
you'd push the second button,
so on and so forth with

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,337
third and fourth word choices.

60
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,091
Now, if you get the answer incorrect,
you will receive an electric shock.

61
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,003
Would you please roll up
your right arm sleeve, please?

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,307
Would you just help me strap him
in to limit any excess movement?

63
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,767
How far do you think he'll go?

64
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,193
- Now this is connected...
- Too soon to tell.

65
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,063
...to the shock generator
in the next room.

66
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,399
- Electrode paste.
- And electrode paste,

67
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,985
to eliminate any excess burns
or blisters.

68
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,447
You know, I should say that
a couple of years ago,

69
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,574
in the West Haven VA Hospital,

70
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,912
they determined that I had
a slight heart condition.

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,792
Nothing serious, but how
dangerous are these shocks?

72
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,878
Well, although the shocks may be
extremely painful,

73
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,506
they cause
no permanent tissue damage.

74
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,967
Oh. Okay.

75
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,428
Well, we'll be communicating
from the next room.

76
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,889
The lab coat,
I decided to make it grey.

77
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,350
White would seem too medical.

78
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,661
- Okay.
- Thank you.

79
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,414
Now, if he gets the answer
incorrect, you administer

80
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,875
the shock by flipping one of
these switches here. You see?

81
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,087
Each switch has
a little red light above it.

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,841
Now, to give you, the teacher,
an idea of the amount of shock

83
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,135
the learner will be receiving,
we think it's only fair that

84
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,971
you receive a sample shock yourself.
Is that all right?

85
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,182
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, just roll up your sleeve.

86
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:14,604
Life can only be understood backwards
but it must be lived forwards.

87
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,648
Good.

88
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,486
Now, I'll ask you to close your
eyes and just estimate for me

89
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,613
the amount of volts
you think you're receiving.

90
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,867
Okay, close.

91
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,915
This part, this part's where
the experiment really begins.

92
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,301
Now, if you will just use this scale
here to tell me the amount of volts

93
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,470
you think you received
in the sample shock.

94
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,348
Pfff, one ninety-five?

95
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,851
No, actually, that's incorrect.
It was 45 volts.

96
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,189
All right.

97
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:06,365
Okay, learner...
I'm going to read you the words,

98
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,700
and then I'm gonna
repeat the first word

99
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,871
and you're going to tell me
the pair for that word. Okay?

100
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,166
He doesn't have a microphone
but he can hear you.

101
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,252
Keep it moving, understand?
Remember that each time he gives

102
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,339
a wrong answer, you move up one
switch on the shock generator.

103
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,758
It is important that you follow
the procedure exactly.

104
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,676
Okay.

105
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,261
Okay, here we go.

106
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,015
"Blue girl. Nice day.

107
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,976
Fat neck. Green ink.

108
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,771
Rich boy. Fast bird.

109
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,774
Blunt arrow. Soft hair.

110
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,568
Cool cave. Gold paint."

111
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,863
In the first word.

112
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:52,369
"Blue: Boy, girl, grass, bat."

113
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,580
Correct.

114
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,334
"Soft rug..."

115
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,753
- He finds his way into it.
- "Pillow, hair, rat."

116
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,298
With increasing confidence
he finds a rhythm, a groove.

117
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,467
That is incorrect.

118
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,760
Until...

119
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,679
Ninety volts.

120
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,691
- Um...
- Here we go.

121
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,237
"Gold:
Dollar, necklace, moon, paint."

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,745
Incorrect. One hundred
and twenty volts. Gold paint.

123
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,460
"Hard: Stone, head, bread, work."

124
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,718
Incorrect.
One hundred and thirty five volts.

125
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,686
Okay.

126
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,941
"Wet: Night, grass, duck, cloth."

127
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,864
Incorrect. One hundred
and fifty volts. Wet duck.

128
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,952
It really hurts.

129
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,205
Mmm.

130
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,500
How do you know
when a change,

131
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,251
a true and lasting change,

132
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,420
is about to overtake your life?

133
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,589
"...grass, man, girl..."

134
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,931
- Eighth floor, please.
- The same.

135
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,403
Are we going to the same party?

136
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,533
Probably. You know Doris Eissenman?

137
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,910
Saul Harwood's invited me.

138
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,704
Ah.

139
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,206
I've never heard of him.

140
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,339
Shall we continue talking or wait
till we're properly introduced?

141
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,751
You're a dancer?

142
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,796
Oh, well,
I studied, here and in Paris.

143
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,966
- But, uh... I work in an office now.
- Mmm-hm.

144
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,719
- What about you?
- I'm at Yale.

145
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,014
Limited dance skills, although
I did spend some time in Paris.

146
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,809
What are you studying at Yale?

147
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,061
I teach, actually. Social Relations.

148
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,689
Did you just give that guy there
your phone number?

149
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,359
So if I wanted your number
I can get it from him?

150
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,571
Social Relations.

151
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,408
- What does that mean?
- It's a combination.

152
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,577
Sociology, anthropology, psychology.

153
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,914
You know, basically covers
everything from

154
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,250
the way people talk in elevators
to the study of

155
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,919
role-playing, conformity, authority.

156
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,216
Rug,
pillow, hair, grass."

157
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,307
Incorrect. A hundred and...

158
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,769
sixty-five volts, strong shock.

159
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,064
Ah! Let me out of here!

160
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,483
I told you, I have a heart condition.

161
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,527
I will not be part of
the experiment anymore!

162
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,031
- He says he's not gonna go on.
- Please continue, teacher.

163
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,284
He says he doesn't want to go on.

164
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,205
Well, whether the learner
likes it or not, he must go on

165
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,415
until he's learned
all the pairs correctly.

166
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,417
Please continue, teacher.

167
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,421
Uh...

168
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,468
Calm down, concentrate.

169
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:26,393
"Sad: Face, music, clown, girl."

170
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,358
Incorrect.
One hundred and eighty volts.

171
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,903
Ahh! Dammit!
Let me out, let me out!

172
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,572
He went all the way.
Most of them do.

173
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,161
"Sharp. Axe, needle, stick, blade."

174
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,001
No response from the learner must be
interpreted as a wrong answer.

175
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:58,049
Still laughing,
trying to hide face with hand.

176
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,969
Something's happening
to that man in there.

177
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,596
Can you please go check that
everything's okay?

178
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,682
Not once we've started.

179
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,517
Please continue, teacher.

180
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,436
So you accept all responsibility?

181
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,438
The responsibility
is mine, correct.

182
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,815
Continue, please.

183
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,029
Night, grass, duck, cloth."

184
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,576
Clenching fist,
pushing it onto table.

185
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,960
- How are you holding up, Alan?
- Necklace,

186
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,338
moon, paint."
Three hundred and seventy five volts.

187
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,591
Dangerous, severe shock.

188
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,847
Let me out of here, let me out.
Get me out of here.

189
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,558
You can't hold me in here.
Get me out.

190
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,701
- What is this?
- I just liked the picture.

191
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,246
The colors... Don't you?

192
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,581
Yeah.

193
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,501
Take it. It's yours.

194
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,380
Why don't you mail it to me?

195
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,811
Or we could leave it here
and you can move in?

196
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,475
That'd be easier, wouldn't it?

197
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:44,447
"Wet: Night, grass, duck, cloth."

198
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,290
"Wet duck." Four hundred
and thirty five volts.

199
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,794
Huh.

200
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,507
Ohh.

201
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:08,930
Okay, um... "Brave: Woman, soldier,
dog, horse."

202
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,229
"Brave woman."

203
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,023
Four hundred and fifty volts.

204
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:26,781
Okay, what now?
I'm at the end at 450 volts.

205
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,492
Continue, please.

206
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,910
The last switch again.

207
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,163
Yeah, but...
but he could be dead in there.

208
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,583
The experiment
requires that you continue.

209
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,626
Go on, please.

210
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,087
And his health doesn't mean anything?

211
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,215
Whether the learner likes it or not,
we must continue.

212
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,509
I'm sorry, look,
I don't mean to be rude, sir,

213
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,304
but I think you should
go look in on him. I mean,

214
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,515
all you have to do is look in on him.
Look into that door.

215
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,727
'Cause I'm not getting any noise,
I'm not getting no sound here.

216
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,812
We must continue.

217
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,482
Go on, please,
the next word is "white".

218
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:25,214
Cloud, horse,
rock, house."

219
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,678
White horse.
Four hundred and fifty volts again.

220
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:40,855
"Fair: Price, rule, skin, sky."

221
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,278
Wrong. 450 again.

222
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,742
All right, thank you.
We are done with the experiment.

223
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,118
Okay.

224
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,886
I'm just going
to speak with the learner.

225
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,831
I think he might be a little upset.
In the meantime,

226
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,084
my assistant would like
to ask you a few questions,

227
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,462
- if you don't mind?
- Yeah, surely.

228
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,047
Dr. Milgram?

229
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,966
How do you do?

230
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,430
Uh, first I'd like...
No, thank you.

231
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,101
- I'd like to ask you some questions.
- Yes, surely.

232
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,194
Uh, why did you give him,
the man in the other room,

233
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,238
the learner, the shocks?

234
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,616
Well, as you could see,
I wanted to stop 'cause...

235
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,619
each time you gave him a shock
the guy hollered.

236
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,955
Did it sound as if he was in pain?

237
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,250
Yeah.

238
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,336
Did he say he wanted you
to stop the experiment?

239
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,879
Yes.

240
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,757
Did he have a right
to stop the experiment?

241
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,094
I don't know.

242
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,139
Why didn't you stop,
at that point,

243
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,766
- when he asked you to stop?
- Why didn't I stop?

244
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,643
- Mm-hm.
- Well, 'cause...

245
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,603
'Cause he told me to continue.

246
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,606
Why did you listen to that man
and not the man in pain?

247
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,448
Well, 'cause... 'cause I thought
the experiment depended on me.

248
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,993
- And nobody told me to stop.
- He asked you to stop.

249
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,205
That... That's true, but he's the...

250
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,542
you know, the subject, shall we say?

251
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,003
Who was the...

252
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,799
Who bore the responsibility for the
fact this man was being shocked?

253
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,847
I don't know.

254
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,313
Could you fill out items six
through 18 on the questionnaire

255
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,608
in front of you, please?
Here's a pen.

256
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,492
Ah, I get a little skittish.

257
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,453
Uh... nervous.

258
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,790
As I explained to
Mr. Wallace in the other room,

259
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,918
this shock generator's actually
used for small animals

260
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,088
for laboratory experiments.
Mice, rats, and so forth.

261
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,509
The visual designation
is actually misleading.

262
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,196
This shock generator's actually
been adjusted so that the shocks

263
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,431
were just slightly stronger
than the shock you experienced.

264
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,974
Are you all right?

265
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,353
Yeah, I'm fine, you know.

266
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,399
No hard feelings. I probably would've
done the same thing myself.

267
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,485
Ciao.

268
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,741
Each subject has a
reconciliation with the learner.

269
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,660
We ask the subject
to maintain a secrecy

270
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,870
so that future recruits
aren't tipped off.

271
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,665
Down the line
we get more candid.

272
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,235
The first thing
I wanna tell you is

273
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,711
the man in the other room
wasn't being shocked.

274
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,132
The only real shock was
the one that you felt early on.

275
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,176
We're really interested in
studying your reaction

276
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,513
to having to inflict pain on
someone you don't know.

277
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,432
The experiment's about
obeying orders.

278
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,769
The man in the other room
works with us as a team.

279
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,604
Jim, you can come out now.

280
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,774
He wasn't really being shocked,
he's perfectly fine.

281
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,192
We weren't trying to fool you,

282
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,611
we're just interested
in studying your reactions.

283
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,656
Man, you dog.

284
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,909
I... I was worried sick.
I thought I was...

285
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,204
You're a good fella.
No hard feelings, no hard feelings.

286
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,582
But you thought
you were really shocking him.

287
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,584
When he wasn't making noise
anymore,

288
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,587
that's when I was worried.
I didn't wanna go on with it.

289
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,839
- But you did go on with it.
- Yeah, but I did not want to.

290
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,091
You saw how it was,
how I was fighting it.

291
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,637
Well, you understand why
we had to do it this way.

292
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,683
We wanted to get true reactions
from people, you see?

293
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,478
You'll receive a copy of the
report when the project's over.

294
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,397
Until then, we ask you not to
say anything.

295
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:55,526
You may end up talking to someone
who is a potential participant.

296
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,656
How do you feel about having
come down here and done this,

297
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,908
now that you know?

298
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,951
I mean...

299
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,747
Now that I know the truth,
I don't mind.

300
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,708
Well, thank you very much
for coming down.

301
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,419
We certainly do appreciate you
giving us your time.

302
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,589
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alan here will help you out.

303
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,550
We think you'll find the report
very interesting.

304
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,637
Thanks. Yeah, thank you.

305
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,857
I still get nervous.
You're cool as ice.

306
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,778
Maybe all those years of
teaching high school

307
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,322
- gives you sort of a...
- Poker face?

308
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,157
Discipline, I was thinking.

309
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,368
You're like a gravedigger.

310
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,662
I think you mean undertaker.

311
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,458
The domino effect starts to kick in,
in the teacher's mind,

312
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,626
once he assumes the role.

313
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,631
Get some women in here.
Get my wife in this seat...

314
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,467
We've got nine kids,
the first squawk

315
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,135
she'd stop the whole shebang.

316
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,221
Nine kids.
Are you sure about that?

317
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,308
Oh, yeah. I have enough saved up
to give 'em each a pair of socks

318
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,394
if the electricity gets me.

319
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,230
You're a brave man, Jim.
All right, next subject's due.

320
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,648
I should get going.

321
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,990
♪ Some enchanted evening ♪

322
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,034
♪ You will meet a stranger ♪

323
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,124
I was born in the Bronx, 1933.

324
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,502
My father's from Hungary,
my mother Romania,

325
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,047
Jewish immigrants. It was a
matter of chance they arrived

326
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,925
in the US as children and
managed to raise a family in

327
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,178
New York instead of being swept
up into the extermination camps

328
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,848
and murdered by the Nazis,
like millions of others like them

329
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,266
in Eastern Europe.

330
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,601
That's really what's behind

331
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,689
the obedience experiments.
The inkling I was chasing...

332
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,191
the thing that troubled me.

333
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,072
How do civilized human beings

334
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,242
participate in destructive,
inhumane acts?

335
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,997
How was genocide implemented so
systematically, so efficiently?

336
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,207
And how did the perpetrators of
these murders

337
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,625
live with themselves?

338
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,309
My daughter, Michele,
a precocious child

339
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,686
who at this point in the story
hasn't yet been born,

340
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,981
used to tell the kids at school,
"My dad's a psychologist,

341
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,359
but not the kind who talks to
people lying down.

342
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,195
He's an experimental
psychologist.

343
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,822
He does experiments."

344
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,452
First let's determine which of
you will be "learner"

345
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,082
and which will be "teacher."

346
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,797
"Teacher."

347
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,008
They both say that.
And no one's caught on?

348
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,552
- Not a soul.
- Not the corporate manager,

349
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,389
the banker, the plumber,
the Good Humor man.

350
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,933
The Good Humor man
was actually vicious.

351
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,727
Crude mesomorph of obviously
limited intelligence.

352
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,939
The script has kind of momentum.
It carries them along.

353
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,691
- Men only?
- Every hour.

354
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,528
It's getting to be a blur,
really.

355
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,656
So you lead them both,
both the teacher and learner,

356
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,368
into the... electric chair?

357
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,788
Well, we don't call it that,

358
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,958
but, yes, if you'll follow me
into the next room, please?

359
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,215
Here's my home.

360
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,260
I think I'd go nuts in this
little room all day.

361
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,638
Well, they keep me busy. Agh!

362
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,223
Actually, I have
a heart condition.

363
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,391
Really?

364
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,227
It does give you authenticity,
I think, in the part.

365
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,313
But I think I'm a better actor
than I am accountant.

366
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,841
It's nearly time for the next one.

367
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,110
- Oh.
- Is somebody in there?

368
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,195
Maybe Alan.

369
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,739
- Shall we join him?
- Sure.

370
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,287
To give you, the teacher,
an idea of how much shock

371
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,575
the learner will be receiving,
we think it's only fair

372
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,584
you receive a sample shock yourself.
Is that all right?

373
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,752
- Fair enough.
- Give me your right arm, please.

374
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,713
This is the only real shock, right?

375
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,173
Mm-hm.

376
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,674
Have you done it?

377
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,260
Been shocked like that,
literally?

378
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,220
- Yeah.
- Yes, it's not pleasant.

379
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,559
Now if you'll just
use the scale here

380
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,311
to estimate for me
the amount of volts you think

381
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,354
you've received
in the sample shock.

382
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,985
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Well, that was only 45 volts.

383
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,196
So go ahead and begin the test.

384
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,948
He doesn't have a microphone
but he can hear you.

385
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,909
Just speak into the microphone.

386
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,744
The rooms are partially
soundproof.

387
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,371
Are you ready, learner?

388
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,626
Continues with
robotic impassivity,

389
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,003
courteous to experimenter.

390
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,756
Seems to derive no pleasure
from the act itself.

391
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,634
Incorrect.

392
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,929
The correct answer is "box".

393
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,723
Curt and officious
when saying "Correct".

394
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,350
Seventy-five volts.

395
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,603
Let me out of here!

396
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,980
Each time
he administers a shock,

397
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,900
lips drawn back, bares his teeth.

398
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,406
"Sweet: Candy, girl, taste, pickle."

399
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,453
Wrong. "Sweet taste."
One hundred and twenty volts.

400
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,415
Let me out of here!

401
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,962
Looks sadly
at the experimenter

402
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,214
and continues reading word pairs.

403
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:59,098
Wrong. "True story".
One hundred and thirty five volts.

404
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,060
"Slow, walk..."

405
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,438
Afterwards, if a learner
who says he agreed to it

406
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,024
and therefore must accept
responsibility.

407
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:13,279
Wrong. "Slow music."
One hundred and fifty volts.

408
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,282
Let me out of here!

409
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,950
I can't stand the pain.

410
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,413
The man, he seems to be getting hurt.

411
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,457
There's no
permanent tissue damage.

412
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,127
Yes, but I know
what shocks do to you.

413
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:32,172
I'm an electrical engineer,
and I have had shocks.

414
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,384
You get real shook up by them,

415
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,512
especially if you know
the next one is coming.

416
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,515
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,310
It's absolutely
essential that you do continue.

418
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,230
Well, I won't, not with the man
screaming to get out.

419
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,899
You have
no other choice.

420
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,406
Why don't I have a choice?

421
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,577
I came here on my own free will.

422
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,163
I thought I could help
in a research project.

423
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,959
But if I have to hurt somebody,
if I was in his place...

424
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,963
No, I can't continue.

425
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,719
I've probably gone too far already.
I'm very sorry.

426
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,188
I could've wept.

427
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,149
I mean he looked like
he wanted to slug me.

428
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,611
Out of gratitude, you do understand,
I mean wept.

429
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,655
Because all day we've been

430
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,074
getting nothing but "wrong," zzzt.

431
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,121
You do realize I have to sit and
listen to you scream all day.

432
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,249
Well, so do I.

433
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,669
He was what, Danish?

434
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,253
Dutch, actually.

435
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,382
Right, but it wasn't his
nationality that caused him

436
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,218
to stop, it was the fact he
worked with electricity.

437
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,552
Hmm.

438
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,514
They all seem
to wanna impress you...

439
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,974
- for some reason.
- Mm-hm.

440
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,310
But why?

441
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,939
Why do so many,
the vast majority,

442
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,483
push all the way through
to the final switch?

443
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:19,029
Why is the Dutchman's defiance
the anomaly instead of the norm?

444
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,199
All the psychiatrists and
psychologists I consulted

445
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,035
were convinced we'd have trouble
finding a single person

446
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,454
that'd go all the way through
to the end. I'd have been

447
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,873
better off consulting the guy
from Pepe's Pizza.

448
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,291
Oh, you mean Pepe?

449
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,001
I think his name is Carmine.

450
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,046
Well, you get my point.
The butcher, the baker,

451
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,715
the candlestick maker.

452
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,302
I'd like to try it,
the test shock.

453
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,265
I just wanna...
know what it feels like.

454
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,809
Sasha.

455
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,813
I don't even think about that,
and I've been in there

456
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,315
supposedly getting
zapped to the maximum.

457
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,905
This really isn't necessary.

458
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,867
Well, yeah,
but it's not harmful either.

459
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,536
I mean I just wanna
understand it better.

460
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,538
Okay.

461
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,835
Other arm.

462
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,935
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

463
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,236
I designed
a series of variations,

464
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,322
25 in all, and continued
the experiments

465
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,990
over the next two semesters.

466
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,310
We adjust the script so that
the learner bangs on the wall...

467
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,455
but says nothing.

468
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,502
We asked the teacher
to physically press

469
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,047
the learner's hand on a copper plate,
forcing him to receive the shock.

470
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,215
House.

471
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,050
Wrong. A hundred
and thirty five volts.

472
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,899
We move the experiment
into a shabby office

473
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,807
in Bridgeport, to deduct the
potential intimidation factor

474
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:14,853
of Ivy League prestige.
And, back at Yale, we include women.

475
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,524
What did you just do?

476
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,777
Uh, he said: "Ow."

477
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,238
Did you turn off the machine?

478
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:30,160
I... I thought that if it seemed
like I...

479
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,621
you know, turn...

480
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,755
Okay.

481
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,382
"Short..."

482
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,758
The machine?

483
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,014
Please continue, teacher.

484
00:30:54,561 --> 00:31:00,774
Okay, "Short: Sentence, movie,
time, skirt."

485
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,990
I'm sorry, that's wrong.
It's "short time".

486
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,170
In nearly every case,
the essential results are the same.

487
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,090
They hesitate, sigh, tremble
and groan,

488
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,093
but they advance to the last
switch, 450 volts,

489
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,681
"Danger Severe Shock XXX",
because they're politely told to.

490
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,436
The results are
terrifying and depressing.

491
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,564
They suggest that the kind of
character produced

492
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,525
in American society
can't be counted on

493
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,445
to insulate its citizens from
brutality and

494
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,365
inhumane treatment in response
to a malevolent authority.

495
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,872
Milgram? Milgram is
Hebrew for pomegranate.

496
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,540
Is that what you mean?
It's one of the seven fruits

497
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,959
- of the Bible.
- You're Jewish, same as me.

498
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,546
You seem upset.
Am I upsetting you?

499
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,715
I have office hours.
You can make an appointment.

500
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,134
Huh? You don't like surprises.

501
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,169
You know, I've been thinking
about the experiment a lot.

502
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,015
It really rattled my wife
about what it said about me.

503
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,894
If she was me, she liked to think
she wouldn't have pulled the switch.

504
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,813
- But you know what?
- What?

505
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,565
You never know.
That's the thing, how can you know?

506
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,610
- You can't, right?
- No, you can't.

507
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,738
If it's any consolation,
a great many participants

508
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,156
were prone to nervous laughter,

509
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,743
but my wife actually is waiting
for me at home for dinner,

510
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,995
- so...
- Are you inviting me?

511
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,374
No. Make an appointment.

512
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,880
With leftover grant money
we film the last two days

513
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,550
of the experiment,
May 26 and 27th, 1962.

514
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,554
Four days later, Adolf Eichmann
is executed in Jerusalem.

515
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,852
Eichmann, architect of
the Holocaust,

516
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,523
responsible for the deportation
and murder of millions of Jews,

517
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,109
escaped to Argentina after
World War II.

518
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,364
He was living with his family
under the name Ricardo Klement,

519
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,492
an employee of Mercedes-Benz,

520
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,328
when Israeli Mossad agents
captured him in 1960

521
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,871
and brought him to trial.

522
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,791
...to completed
the translations,

523
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,377
I beg to submit a translation

524
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,755
into the German of our number, 887.

525
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,133
Eichmann didn't
deny his crimes,

526
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,011
showed no trace of guilt
or remorse.

527
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,638
Said he was merely a transmitter.

528
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,391
"I never did anything great or small

529
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,186
without express instructions
from my superiors."

530
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:54,239
The cradle rocks above an
abyss and common sense tells us

531
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,909
that our existence is but
a brief crack of light between

532
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,162
two eternities of darkness.

533
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,630
Let me out of here!
Hey, that really hurts!

534
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,799
I told you,
I have a heart condition!

535
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,302
I will not be in
this experiment anymore!

536
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,512
Ow! Let me out.

537
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,681
Let me outta here! Let me out!

538
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:23,268
Let... me... out... of here.

539
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:28,440
♪ I will no longer be here ♪

540
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,529
Ah, hey, Stanley,
a nice day to wrap up

541
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,741
- the new obedience experiment.
- Yeah, yeah.

542
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,161
Hmm.

543
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,584
I should tell you about Asch.
Solomon E. Asch.

544
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,879
He oversaw my thesis at
Harvard, and I worked for him,

545
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,756
diligently and miserably,

546
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,759
at the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton.

547
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,638
Asch did the thing with the lines,
right?

548
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,223
About a dozen years ago.

549
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,352
The study you are taking part in
today involves the perception

550
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,687
of the lengths of lines.

551
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,108
As you can see, there are
a number of cards,

552
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,152
and on each card there are
several lines.

553
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,239
Your task is a very simple one.

554
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,617
You're to look at the line on
the left and determine which of

555
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,912
the three lines on the right
is equal to it in length.

556
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,875
This is a recreation
from a film I made in the 70's.

557
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,628
Five of the six participants are
confederates.

558
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,840
The single true subject
in the white T-shirt

559
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,510
hears everyone else's answers
before announcing his decision.

560
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,804
- Two.
- Two.

561
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,681
- Two.
- Two.

562
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,849
Two.

563
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:47,561
Very good. Let's move onto
the next card. Same thing, gentlemen.

564
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,063
- Three.
- Three.

565
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,774
- Three.
- Three.

566
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,902
After the first few
rounds, members of the group

567
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,487
choose the wrong line.

568
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,739
- Two.
- Two.

569
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,701
The subject denies
the evidence of his own eyes

570
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,162
and yields to group influence.

571
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,580
Two.

572
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,082
Very good. Thank you.

573
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,459
In the language of social science,
the experiment

574
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,546
was known as "The Effect of Group
Pressure Upon the Modification

575
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,425
- and Distortion of Judgments."
- Pff. Great title.

576
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,968
It made Asch famous...

577
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,971
amongst social scientists.

578
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,904
It always bothered me that
the experiment was about lines.

579
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,364
I wanted to do something
more humanly significant.

580
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,247
He hears the bell.

581
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,750
Stanley, it's so good
to see you.

582
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,170
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- This is Sasha.

583
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,590
Sasha, how are you?
So lovely to see you. Come in.

584
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,841
- Stanley
- How are you?

585
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,134
Glad you made it.

586
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,474
Can we tell you what a miserable
time I had working for Asch?

587
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,770
Princeton, the bureaucracy,
the institutional arrogance.

588
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,773
Not permitted to use a scrap of
paper without it becoming

589
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,692
an issue to be settled behind
closed doors.

590
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,279
A candy bar in the office

591
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,573
and I was reported
via formal letter.

592
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,088
I assumed he'd introduce me to
the leading intellectuals of the day.

593
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,495
This did not happen.

594
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,998
I assumed that he'd acknowledge
me in the book I was researching

595
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,000
for him, a book on conformity.

596
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,921
He did not finish the book.

597
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,049
It was like drinking from
a glass with a false bottom.

598
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,551
I thought there'd be more.
I was thirsty.

599
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,554
Please call me Sholem,
I would prefer it.

600
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,390
There's no need to be so stuffy.

601
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,101
In an elevator? Really?

602
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,645
They met in an elevator.

603
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,398
Can someone please pacify
the dog?

604
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,527
Here I am,
still trying to impress him.

605
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,904
Human nature can be studied
but not escaped,

606
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,531
especially your own.

607
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,617
Well, I was on my way
into this party

608
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,120
and I could feel somebody
walking behind me

609
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,039
as I went into the building.
We both got onto the elevator,

610
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,709
and it turned out we were going
to the same floor.

611
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,128
And one of us said,
I don't remember which,

612
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,963
"Are we going to the same party?"

613
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,339
My fate was sealed.

614
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,718
He didn't leave my side
the whole night.

615
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,303
And he drove me home,

616
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,180
and it turned out we had
a lot in common.

617
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,350
We were both from the Bronx,
my mother was born in Russia.

618
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,478
So my sister's friend,
her parents in Vienna

619
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,648
had sent her and her brothers
to New York during the war.

620
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,900
But when I was over there
visiting, they had

621
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,987
just reclaimed their factory,
and it was a coat factory,

622
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,613
and that's where I got this.

623
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:50,869
So, you're a well-travelled
American girl, born in Switzerland,

624
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:55,290
who took dance lessons in Paris
and is wearing a Viennese coat?

625
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,586
Why haven't we met before?

626
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,506
Stanley, why do you feel
compelled to dwell on

627
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,259
the negative aspects of obedience?

628
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,929
Why must you focus on
its destructive potential?

629
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,058
Obedience isn't necessarily
an instrument of evil.

630
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,144
I think we can both agree,
looking at recent history,

631
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,896
the history that brought you
to this country,

632
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,232
a history in which
we see abusive power

633
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,527
assuming unprecedented
murderous dimensions.

634
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,031
Why does your experiment give me
a dirty feeling?

635
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,950
He didn't expect these results.

636
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,328
He tried to change
the conditions

637
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,872
so that people
would refuse to obey.

638
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,540
Ah.

639
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,628
We met in a library.
Oh, him, not him.

640
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,465
The whole time...
I'm sorry, this is startling.

641
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:50,261
Out of 780 subjects,
not a single person got up,

642
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,055
went to the door and looked in

643
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,307
to see if the man screaming
was all right.

644
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,435
Not a single one.

645
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,776
Sasha goes back
to school, Smith College,

646
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,486
for her degree in social work.

647
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,282
My first obedience paper
submitted almost two years ago

648
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,785
to the Journal of Abnormal
and Social Psychology

649
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,955
is finally published
in October 1963,

650
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,749
just after I start
a new job at Harvard,

651
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,794
Assistant Professor,
Department of Social Relations.

652
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,464
Am I impressed with myself
being at Harvard?

653
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:30,885
Well, I got my PhD here,
Harvard is the best place to be.

654
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,141
The subjects were seen to swear,
tremble, stutter,

655
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,978
bite their lips, dig their
fingernails into the flesh,

656
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,065
and these were characteristic
responses, not exceptions,

657
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:48,403
and yet, despite this behavior,
the majority complied.

658
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,531
Yes?

659
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,741
How do you justify
the deception?

660
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,538
I like to think of it as illusion,
not deception.

661
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,416
Semantics, you may say,
but illusion, you know,

662
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,835
has a revelatory function,
as in a play.

663
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,296
Illusion can set the stage
for revelation,

664
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,007
to reveal certain
difficult-to-get-at truths.

665
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,093
But still, when you go to see
a play, you pay for a ticket.

666
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,803
You know you're seeing a play.

667
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,222
These people didn't know
it wasn't real.

668
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,267
You tricked them.

669
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,270
Hello, today we'll be
doing an experiment about

670
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,647
blind obedience
to malevolent authority.

671
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,484
I'd like for you to pretend
that this machine is delivering

672
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,819
painful shocks to a person in
the other room.

673
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,946
How truthful do you think
that would be?

674
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:36,075
But if you think of it, really,
you were delivering shocks

675
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,454
to your subjects.
Psychological shocks.

676
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,206
- And the anxieties...
- No...

677
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,957
...methodically, for one year.

678
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,627
If your facts were
as solid as your imagination,

679
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,046
you'd realize that this is
a false analogy.

680
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:53,176
As Kierkegaard says,
"Take away paradox from the thinker

681
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,054
- and you have a professor."
- An assistant professor.

682
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,473
For the moment,
Dr. Milgram and myself

683
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,808
are only assistant professors,
it's true.

684
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,561
The gentleman
in the elevator now

685
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,605
is a Candid star.

686
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,316
These folks who are entering,
the man with the white shirt,

687
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,068
the lady with the trench coat,

688
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:14,113
and, subsequently,
one other member of our staff,

689
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,574
will face the rear.

690
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,578
And you'll see how this man in
the trench coat...

691
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,712
...tries to maintain his
individuality,

692
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,466
but, little by little...

693
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,518
...he looks at his watch but
he's really making an excuse

694
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,646
for turning just a little bit
more to the wall."

695
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,523
Actually, it's true.

696
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,568
There's an element of illusion
in almost all my work.

697
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,279
This man has apparently

698
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,780
been in groups before.

699
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,127
Candid Camera was a reference point,
I never deny that.

700
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,713
You can see that plainly enough
in the lost letter technique,

701
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,132
which I conceived of at Yale and
was refined at Harvard.

702
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,343
Leave a letter, a sealed,
stamped letter

703
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,762
but un-mailed,
for someone else to find.

704
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,765
Leave it on a sidewalk,
inside a store, a phone booth.

705
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,559
Put it under the windshield
wipers of a parked car

706
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,228
with a note saying,
"Found near car."

707
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,107
All letters are addressed to
the same post office box.

708
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,151
But they're evenly split between

709
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,403
four different
intended recipients.

710
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,656
Friends of the Communist Party,
friends of the Nazi Party,

711
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,744
Medical Research Associates,
and Mr. Walter Carnap.

712
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,329
All fictitious.

713
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,373
The innocuous content of
the letters,

714
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,001
if anyone's curious enough
to open and read,

715
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,503
was a simple message
from "Max" to "Walter"

716
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,172
proposing an upcoming meeting.

717
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,055
Carnap.
It's kind of an odd name.

718
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,390
Like the philosopher?

719
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,563
In two weeks,

720
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,607
out of 100 lost letters
to each addressee,

721
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,610
72 were sent to the Medical
Research Associates,

722
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,154
whilst 71 were sent to
Mr. Walter Carnap,

723
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,866
but a mere 25 to
the Friends of the Communists,

724
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,911
and the same number, 25,
to the Nazis.

725
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,664
We can deduce from this
that the American public

726
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,916
has an aversion
to Nazis and Communists.

727
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,336
Results that are reasonable
and even comforting,

728
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,131
though not startling.
But why not take it further?

729
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,966
Taketo Murata, another student,

730
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,511
drives to Charlotte and
Raleigh, North Carolina,

731
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,179
to lose a new batch of letters.

732
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,319
When the letters come back,
the percentages, once again,

733
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,697
confirm expected prejudices.

734
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,282
Pro-white letters get mailed
more often

735
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,118
in white neighborhoods.

736
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,746
More pro-negro letters get
mailed from black neighborhoods.

737
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,875
A variation.

738
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,295
I hire a pilot with
a Piper Cub to fly low

739
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,339
over Worcester, Massachusetts,

740
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,133
spilling lost letters.

741
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,052
They land in trees, ponds,
on rooftops.

742
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,722
Not all my ideas are brilliant.

743
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:42,989
Well, it's not on the front page,
strangely enough.

744
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,294
I found it. Page ten.

745
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,507
Okay. Uh...

746
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,553
"Yale experiment shows
many distraught over cruelty

747
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,929
but did not stop."

748
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,390
It's odd to see one's name
in the paper,

749
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,350
but maybe I can get used to it.

750
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,727
"Subjects have been studied

751
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,855
under 24 different experimental
conditions."

752
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,648
It wasn't a thousand, was it?

753
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,859
I talked to him for
over half an hour

754
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,819
and I don't see
a single direct quote.

755
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:26,365
"Dr. Milgram pointed out that,
'From 1933 to 1945,

756
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,409
millions of persons

757
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,704
were systematically slaughtered
on command.

758
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,541
Gas chambers were built,
death camps were guarded,

759
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:39,337
corpses were produced
with the same efficiency

760
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,673
as the manufacture of appliances."'

761
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,467
There's a quote.

762
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,569
Do you think anyone else reads
this paper?

763
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,363
President Kennedy has been shot.

764
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,532
He was shot in the motorcade
in Dallas.

765
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,118
He was shot in the head.

766
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,831
It's Milgram. It's just another
one of his experiments.

767
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,499
- On the level?
- Yes.

768
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,668
Kelly, you've got that radio,
yeah? Turn it on.

769
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,756
...his tour
of the City of Dallas, Texas.

770
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,133
A presidential aide,
Mario Bryan, said he had

771
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,511
no information on whether
the President is alive..."

772
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,305
He's rigged a faked broadcast,
like Orson Welles.

773
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,640
I have?

774
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,892
I wonder what the experiment's
really about?

775
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,854
- This is real.
- ...the president is critical.

776
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,189
Texas Governor John Connally
also was shot

777
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,900
and has been taken to surgery
in Parkland Hospital...

778
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,557
I got it cheap, I got it cheap
from a grad student.

779
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,669
He gave me a deal when he realized

780
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,288
he couldn't take it with him
to London.

781
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,397
It's making a funny noise.
Maybe you can have a look.

782
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,525
- Stanley...
- You love this kind of thing.

783
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,903
The dean lives
right across the street.

784
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,196
We just applied for
financial aid.

785
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,616
A Jaguar, right.
What's he going to think?

786
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,326
What...
Who cares what he thinks?

787
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,660
I didn't say that.

788
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,914
- Well...
- I didn't say that.

789
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,500
Yeah.

790
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,377
See you soon.

791
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,803
It was cheaper than you think,

792
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,891
but I understand it creates
the wrong impression.

793
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,265
- Do you?
- I do.

794
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,476
Or are you just doing an imitation of

795
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,187
someone who listens,
who's reasonable?

796
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,064
Well, we're going to need two cars.

797
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,607
Hmm.

798
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,525
Is that the dean?

799
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,948
Well, maybe it'll impress
the Harvard tenure committee.

800
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,407
Who cares what they think?

801
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,456
- So you returned the car?
- I did.

802
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,334
- It was sensible.
- Hmm.

803
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,337
I don't know a single tenured
professor who drives a Jaguar.

804
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,965
I didn't like the color.

805
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,927
If you get turned down it won't
be because of an automobile.

806
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,514
But it's got to sting, yeah?

807
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,017
The attacks, the criticisms,
the violent reactions.

808
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,729
That woman was going through
a divorce, it turns out.

809
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,064
I didn't take it personally.

810
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,193
I'm going through a divorce.

811
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,154
I don't spit at people.

812
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,994
I'm sorry to hear that.

813
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,497
Thank you.

814
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,180
It's true that I am, possibly,
more than commonly on edge,

815
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,933
but how would you feel if you
picked up a copy of

816
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,269
American Psychologist
and found yourself attacked in

817
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:27,648
an article called
"Some Thoughts on Ethics in Research:

818
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,110
a Response to Milgram's
Behavioral Study of Obedience"?

819
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,822
Psychiatrists,
many of you in this room,

820
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,491
predicted that only one person
in a thousand

821
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,035
would deliver the shocks across
the board,

822
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:43,122
an estimate that was off by
a factor of 500.

823
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:48,294
So what happened in the lab was
discovered, not planned.

824
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,299
But you expected, you knew you
were going to worry some people.

825
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,675
- Mmm.
- Stress, in fact,

826
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,677
- was a part of it.
- Well, every...

827
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,887
Extreme stress.

828
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,223
Every experiment is a situation
where the end is unknown,

829
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,394
indeterminate,
something that might fail.

830
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,147
The indeterminacy is part of
the excitement.

831
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,775
Ethics. The undertow of ethics.

832
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:16,489
I wanted to ask a question,
a series of questions

833
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,325
about the psychological function
of obedience.

834
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,995
The conditions that shape it,
the defense mechanisms it entails.

835
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:28,084
The emotional forces
that keep a person obeying.

836
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,128
As someone with pretensions as
a moral educator,

837
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:35,549
let me suggest that science must
enhance our moral personhood,

838
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,218
not... not diminish it.

839
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,347
You forced people
to torture other people.

840
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,932
- No.
- To see if they...

841
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,894
No. No. No.
That is alien to my view.

842
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,731
No one was forced, right?

843
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,692
The experimenter told the
subject to perform an action.

844
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,363
What happened between
the command and the outcome

845
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,073
is the individual.

846
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:04,745
With conscience and a will,
who can either obey or disobey.

847
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:09,208
I don't see how you can
seriously equate victimization

848
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,837
in a laboratory con
with the willful participation

849
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,255
in mass murder.

850
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,549
Victimization? Look...

851
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,553
When the experiments were complete...

852
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:26,225
all the subjects were sent this
questionnaire. Here's some examples.

853
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,899
Eighty-four percent said they were
glad to have been in the experiment.

854
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,069
Fifteen percent
indicated neutral feelings.

855
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:41,323
One point three percent
indicated negative feelings.

856
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,993
One point three percent.

857
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,371
Four-fifths thought more
experiments of this sort

858
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:51,208
should be carried out,
and 74 percent said they had

859
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:55,171
learned something of personal
importance about themselves

860
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,549
and about the conditions
that shape human action.

861
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:05,764
A year after the study,
a psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Errara,

862
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,092
was hired to meet with subjects
who might have suffered

863
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,685
possible negative effects.

864
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,814
This is not another experiment.
There's no trick here.

865
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,692
I can see why you may have
your doubts.

866
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,985
- Yes.
- Yes.

867
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,196
This is a debriefing meeting.

868
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,324
We're here to assess
the after-effects.

869
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,327
So, tell us how you feel.

870
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,623
I'd like to know
what the point is of it.

871
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,335
To learn something about
human nature.

872
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,711
That was the aim.

873
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,464
Professor Milgram?

874
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:44,386
I hope that... I sincerely hope that,
basically,

875
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,835
you don't have the feeling that
would rather not have been

876
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,641
a part of this experiment.

877
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,270
It's an interesting life experience.

878
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,648
I don't like hurting anyone

879
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,776
and I can't understand myself
going all the way.

880
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,737
- It left me feeling guilty.
- Mm-hm.

881
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,530
Weren't we supposed
to have coffee?

882
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,032
Yeah.

883
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,535
I told my husband.
I know I wasn't supposed to.

884
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,080
But I don't do everything I'm told.

885
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,166
He said he wouldn't have done
the shocks, he would have refused.

886
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,296
I wanted to cry,
but I started to laugh.

887
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,633
- I think I did both.
- I was quite frightened,

888
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,386
and I was quivering, and it's...

889
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:28,597
I actually tried to memorize
the word pairs myself

890
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,140
so that if they
switched it around

891
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,767
I wouldn't have to get
those shocks.

892
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,312
There's a tendency to think that
everything a person does

893
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,816
is due to the feelings or ideas
within the person.

894
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,194
You haven't had your coffee.
You want coffee?

895
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,989
- Yes.
- Cream? Sugar?

896
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,449
- I'll take two sugars.
- Both, please.

897
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,826
Yes, thank you.

898
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:54,039
But sometimes a person's actions
depend equally

899
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,166
on the situation
you find yourself in.

900
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:59,461
And in this case, the power of
the situation overwhelmed

901
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,380
your personal power.

902
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,465
I'm an understanding person.

903
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,342
Okay?

904
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,596
I'm an intelligent human being.
Speak the truth to me...

905
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,935
and I'll cooperate gladly,
even if it's a bitter truth,

906
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,520
but don't lie to me.

907
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,233
The purpose was
to advance science,

908
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,360
learn something.

909
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:27,865
Maybe you shouldn't do this kind
of experiment if you have to deceive.

910
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,745
Look, you can deceive other
people but don't deceive me.

911
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,959
We had half a dozen sessions
with Errara

912
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,920
and invited subjects.
The meetings were sparsely attended,

913
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,965
full of confusion and complaints,
but we concluded

914
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,176
that no one showed signs of harm,

915
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,886
no one had been traumatized.

916
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,389
- Stanley?
- Tom Shannon.

917
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,602
Tom did the wiring on
the shock generator.

918
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,396
- At Yale. The shock box.
- It's nice to meet you.

919
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,774
- This is Sasha.
- This is Michele.

920
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,027
Hey, I hated hearing about
Jim McDonough. Dead at 49.

921
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,987
That stuff about his heart
was no joke.

922
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:11,116
Yeah, I know. Sat down to a bowl
of oatmeal and... had a heart attack.

923
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,538
He had nine kids.

924
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:20,376
Oh, sad. Maybe you shouldn't
unload such a large brood

925
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,503
into the world, no offense.

926
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,756
She's taking us to Paris.
It's the first stamp on her passport.

927
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,509
- That's awesome.
- Sasha thinks I need a vacation.

928
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,677
Yeah. I heard they roughed you
up pretty good

929
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,639
- about those results.
- He's up for tenure.

930
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,287
People get feisty,
but it'll work out.

931
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,310
Gotta finish your book now.
Publish or perish, right?

932
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,314
Actually, I got sidetracked
working on The Small World Problem.

933
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,361
For The Small World Problem,
we asked people in Kansas and Omaha

934
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:51,240
to mail a packet to a person in
Sharon, Massachusetts.

935
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,743
The instructions are simple.

936
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,455
There's a target person.

937
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,375
In this case, a stockbroker
named Jacobs in Sharon, Mass.

938
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,253
Assuming they don't know them,
people are asked to mail

939
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,422
the folder to someone who might
know him.

940
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,716
They can send it to a friend,
relative, or acquaintance,

941
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,803
but they have to send it,
and this is key, to a person

942
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,515
they know on a first-name basis.
There's a roster to fill out

943
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,018
and a batch of postcards to mail
back to Harvard to track the process.

944
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,272
Will it work? We don't know.

945
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,150
A woman in Omaha sends the
folder to a high school friend,

946
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,277
a bank clerk, in Council Bluffs,
Iowa.

947
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,613
She sends it to a man in Belmont,
Massachusetts, a publisher,

948
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,533
who sends it to a tanner in
Sharon, the tanner sends it

949
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,953
to his brother-in-law, a sheet
metal worker, also in Sharon,

950
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,206
who sends it to a dentist,
who sends it to a printer,

951
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,709
who sends it to Mr. Jacobs.

952
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,419
Seven links in the chain.

953
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,133
The average chain, in fact,
involves 5.5 links.

954
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,344
That is, we determine that less
than six degrees of separation

955
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,347
exist between you
and several million strangers

956
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,766
who you may or may not encounter
in your lifetime.

957
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,855
When we understand the structure
of this communication net,

958
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,859
we stand to grasp a good deal
more about the fabric of society.

959
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:14,281
Maybe it's not necessarily justified,
this common human complaint.

960
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:18,243
The feeling that we're all
cut off, alienated, and alone.

961
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,957
I don't need to go into detail do I?
The things I remember,

962
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,876
when I was 16, in Bucharest.

963
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,171
The killings, torture, terror.

964
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,090
- Why are you bringing this up now?
- It's relevant.

965
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,844
The man was just turned down
for tenure at Harvard.

966
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,972
You wish to give the tragedy
some perspective.

967
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,017
It's not just that.
Because, bear with me,

968
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,394
they took people to the
slaughterhouse and strung them

969
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:49,024
on meat hooks, still alive.
Cut open their bellies like cattle.

970
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,651
A five-year-old boy.

971
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:55,322
And they watched the entrails
spill out, the blood drain,

972
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,535
and they wrote notes and they
pinned the papers to the bodies.

973
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,578
"Kosher."

974
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,647
Serge was just giving me
a lesson in...

975
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:29,940
Reality?

976
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,527
The pogroms,
in Romania during the war.

977
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,613
The Iron Guard...

978
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:41,493
they lit people on fire,
threw them off buildings.

979
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,707
This is my charming way of
saying your husband's work

980
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,667
is very important...

981
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,586
and timely.

982
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,464
Because the techniques change,
the victims change,

983
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,594
but it's still a question.
How do these things happen?

984
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,222
How are they institutionalized?

985
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:09,396
The Algerian War, the tortures.
Do you know about this in the States?

986
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,064
Yeah, of course.

987
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:15,277
You should do the obedience
experiments in Europe, Stanley.

988
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:19,573
France, Germany.
Recreate them.

989
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,200
Will it be different?

990
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,038
- I don't think so.
- Who would fund them?

991
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,208
The experiments are unethical.
Remember?

992
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,670
No tenure, no funding.

993
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,341
And the IRBs? The IRBs, yes?

994
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,385
Basically you cannot do these
experiments without submitting

995
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,429
something to
the Internal Review Board.

996
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,058
He'll finish his book, and then
Stanley wants to move on

997
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:48,852
from the obedience experiments,
and why not?

998
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,232
Well, you look under a rock,
ugly things crawl out,

999
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,068
and we have to face them.

1000
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:03,659
Your other experiments,
the letters, the maps,

1001
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,370
clever, hopeful,

1002
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:10,666
but you have to get back to
the obedience experiments.

1003
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:15,545
- I do? I have to?
- Yes, Stanley. You have no choice.

1004
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,723
My new job at
City University of New York

1005
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:29,893
involves a jump in pay
and full professorship.

1006
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,813
Head of the department of
social psychology.

1007
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,441
The City of New York is
a major laboratory,

1008
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,569
to be utilized in the research and
training of graduate students

1009
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,279
in social psychology.

1010
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,281
That's from the CUNY brochure.

1011
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,617
I wrote it.

1012
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:51,415
Sasha finds an apartment for us
in Riverdale

1013
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:55,669
with a great view of the Hudson.
Marc was born in 1967.

1014
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,754
He hardly remembers Cambridge.

1015
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,217
Even, or especially when nothing
decisive is happening,

1016
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,220
time refuses to stand still.

1017
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:13,812
I walk to the station every morning,
take the train into the city.

1018
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,565
I enjoy the routine.

1019
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,530
Today's assignment.
Get on a local bus,

1020
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,450
and then with the bus in motion
and loud enough

1021
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,744
to be heard by your fellow
passengers,

1022
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,370
sing your favorite song.

1023
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,374
Any song we want?

1024
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:38,128
Just as long as you know the
words and can sing them loud

1025
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:42,215
and clear. Pair up. Non-singer
takes notes, then switch roles.

1026
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:49,306
You may say, "So what? Singing
a song, anyone can do that."

1027
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,809
Or, "I don't have to do that,
I'm an individual, not a conformist."

1028
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:56,688
Or, "This is silly, it doesn't change
the world to sing a song."

1029
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:03,695
get on the bus and sing.

1030
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,699
Now go, right now. Come on.

1031
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:13,997
No humming.

1032
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,637
My next guest is
professor of psychology

1033
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,973
at the Graduate Center,
the City University in New York.

1034
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,769
He's written a fascinating book,
a disturbing book.

1035
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:39,397
An Experimental View,

1036
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,566
just published by Harper & Row.

1037
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:46,488
Please welcome a very creative,
very controversial

1038
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,741
socio-psychologist,
Stanley Milgram.

1039
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,326
Doctor. Dr. Milgram.

1040
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,997
So your subjects, they thought
the shocks were real,

1041
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:59,876
that they were
delivering 450 volts,

1042
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,878
- Sixty five percent of them.
- Mm.

1043
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:06,091
But they were not particularly
aggressive or sadistic people.

1044
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,927
They were a representative
cross-section of the average

1045
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,013
American citizen living within
range of Yale University.

1046
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:15,392
I thought, yes, we'd do
the experiment in New Haven,

1047
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,311
and there'd be very limited
obedience,

1048
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:21,314
and then we'd recreate
the experiment in, say, Berlin,

1049
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,526
and find the rate of obedience
to be much higher.

1050
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,654
Saved a bit on airfare,
didn't you?

1051
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,449
So, let me get this straight.

1052
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,619
You did the experiment
in the early '60s?

1053
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:40,542
And here we are, 1974,
and your book still feels like news.

1054
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,711
Why is that?

1055
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,923
People don't have the resources
to resist authority.

1056
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,175
That's what the experiment
teaches us.

1057
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,887
But people don't wanna hear it.
The experiment explains

1058
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:56,808
a kind of...
flaw in social thinking,

1059
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,853
a deadening,
a suspension of moral value.

1060
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,980
What would you
say to your critics,

1061
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,942
critics who would insist
the moral lapse is yours?

1062
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:11,031
One of them cites "the extremely
callous, deceitful way

1063
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,949
the experiments were carried out."

1064
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,494
Another calls them
"morally repugnant, vile."

1065
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,749
"Milgram belongs on the
other end of the shock machine."

1066
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:26,004
There certainly is a certain
kind of Kafkaesque quality

1067
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,923
- to the experiments.
- Kafkaesque?

1068
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,216
The experiment taught me
something about the, uh,

1069
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,636
plasticity of human nature.

1070
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:38,224
Not the evil, not the aggressiveness,
but a certain kind of malleability.

1071
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,478
Sixty-five percent of volunteers
were obedient.

1072
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,941
That left 35 percent who
recognized a moral breach,

1073
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,194
took responsibility for
their actions and resisted.

1074
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,529
There is no permanent tissue damage.

1075
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,532
That's your opinion.
If he doesn't want to continue,

1076
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,242
I'm taking orders from him.

1077
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,246
The experiment requires you continue.
You have no other choice.

1078
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:03,249
If this were Russia maybe,
but not in America.

1079
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,420
But obedience,
compliance, was more common.

1080
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:12,759
You tell yourself, "I wouldn't
do that. I'd never do that."

1081
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,553
But then, what did Montaigne
say?

1082
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:21,476
"We are double in ourselves.
What we believe we disbelieve,

1083
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,813
and we cannot rid ourselves of
what we condemn."

1084
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:44,833
Another one of my experiments.
Hank, a CUNY grad student,

1085
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,044
was the designated
"crowd crystal" staring up

1086
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:49,838
at a fixed point in space,

1087
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,133
looking up at a
non-existent something.

1088
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,553
As you multiply the confederates,

1089
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,806
the people who stare up because
we've recruited them to stare up,

1090
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,517
the number of people who
actually stop and look

1091
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,227
increases exponentially.

1092
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:09,190
Meanwhile, Obedience to Authority
gets translated into

1093
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,610
eight languages and nominated
for a national book award.

1094
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:20,535
October 24th, 1974, 4:25pm.

1095
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:24,122
Sheila Jarcho, J-A-R...

1096
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,749
I know how to spell it,
Stanley.

1097
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:29,836
...C-H-O, working on the mental
maps project, comes in

1098
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:33,048
and tells me errors were made in
the neighborhood map,

1099
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,759
already duplicated in some
500 copies.

1100
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:40,013
Her facial expression captures
the attitude that she's shown

1101
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,599
all along in her capacity as
research assistant.

1102
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,851
Are my eyes
really that close together?

1103
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:48,104
On the whole, both men and women
are highly critical

1104
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,939
when studying photographs of
themselves.

1105
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,025
The vanity factor's
extraordinary

1106
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,735
when people judge
their own image.

1107
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,904
Do you ever worry that
everything's sort of

1108
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,990
an anti-climax since
the obedience experiments,

1109
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,827
and that your work,
really everything you're doing,

1110
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,704
is just a flash in the pan?

1111
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,668
The truth is, you're invested in
the idea of authority

1112
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,254
and you love lording it over
all of us.

1113
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,965
Me, the other students,
and even your wife.

1114
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,259
- Me?
- Well, fuck yeah.

1115
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:23,348
I work here because I get paid for it

1116
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,642
and I actually think
it's kind of fun.

1117
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,895
Sheila, what's wrong with you?

1118
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,357
Huh. Just keep doing
what he tells you to do.

1119
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:37,320
I don't get along
with all my students.

1120
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,405
The flash in the pan?

1121
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:42,367
How many people can manage
even that flash?

1122
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,203
I've done some psych
experiments,

1123
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,456
but in my mind I'm still about
to write my great Broadway musical.

1124
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:53,795
4:27 pm. Paul Hollander,
looking tan and fit,

1125
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,630
pays a visit from Massachusetts.

1126
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:58,341
Tan and fit and miserable.

1127
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,260
I am so sorry, Paul.

1128
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,554
Well, another marriage
down the drain.

1129
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:06,057
- I should've seen it coming.
- It's terrible, rotten.

1130
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,934
But you look good.

1131
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,902
The worst of it is she's
erected a Berlin Wall

1132
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,604
- between me and my daughter.
- Oh.

1133
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:17,569
- Nice place you've got here.
- It isn't Harvard, but, thank you.

1134
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,696
Harvard would never have given
you an office half as grand

1135
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:23,366
as this, or found you
as bewitching a secretary.

1136
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,743
Oh. Well, I just go
where the work is.

1137
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,414
So, aren't you
going to take my picture, then?

1138
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,292
I'm considering it.

1139
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:44,345
Do you ever feel invincible one
moment and then worthless the next?

1140
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,934
Yes and no.

1141
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:01,696
The camera begins to attract
its own subject matter.

1142
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,448
It's no longer a passive recorder

1143
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,368
but actively attracts
the people it records.

1144
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,292
Uh, Stanley Milgram?

1145
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,171
How did I get to be so old?

1146
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:21,216
What is the Kierkegaard quote?

1147
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,511
"Life can always be...

1148
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,722
Only be understood backward."

1149
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,558
October 24th, 1974, 4:29 pm.

1150
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,728
Conversation with Paul Hollander
interrupted by the arrival of

1151
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,856
a messenger bearing, at last,

1152
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:39,734
the German edition of
Obedience to Authority.

1153
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,528
With crass barbed wire
cover design.

1154
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:43,988
Mein Gott.

1155
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,867
- What's your name?
- Thomas Shine.

1156
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,744
Mind participating in
my experiment?

1157
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:51,996
It depends.

1158
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,582
He just wants to take your picture.
Everybody's doing it.

1159
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,671
- Okay. I need a signature.
- Oh, yes.

1160
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:03,466
He's interested in
the unacknowledged power

1161
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:04,968
of photographic images.

1162
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,388
Okay.

1163
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:12,684
"Life can only be understood
backwards,

1164
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,603
but has to be lived forwards."

1165
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,619
Around this time,
I was also working on

1166
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,538
The Familiar Stranger.

1167
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,377
We take photographs of commuters
on a train platform.

1168
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,213
Each figure in the photographs
are given a number.

1169
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,048
The photos are duplicated,

1170
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:46,259
and a week later
the students follow up.

1171
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:50,430
Hello. I'm a student at CUNY.

1172
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,397
Would you mind filling out
this questionnaire?

1173
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,434
- Okay.
- Also,

1174
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,185
do you recognize
any of these people?

1175
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,895
No.

1176
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,773
- What about here?
- Well, that's me.

1177
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,443
Yes.
Can you identify anyone else?

1178
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,028
Not by name.

1179
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,741
Most commuters recognize,
on average, four individuals

1180
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:12,577
that they see in their daily routine
but never speak to.

1181
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,162
Familiar strangers.

1182
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,040
Amongst these are
"sociometric stars".

1183
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:21,127
Figures that they not only recognize
but even fantasize about.

1184
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:28,801
They wonder what kind of lives
these strangers lead,

1185
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,303
what their jobs are like.

1186
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,181
And if they ran into each other
in another place,

1187
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:36,809
or if some emergency jolted them
out of this routine,

1188
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,521
they might start to speak,
actually know one another.

1189
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,655
I teach at CUNY, and I see you
out here, you know, all the time

1190
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:51,616
and I wonder about the things
you must see.

1191
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:54,577
You look familiar.
What do you teach?

1192
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,997
Social psychology. "The City of
New York is a vast laboratory."

1193
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,583
I had no idea you were English.
You're English?

1194
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,877
- Yes.
- Assuming that accent is real.

1195
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:06,839
- I saw you on TV.
- Good Morning America.

1196
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:09,801
- I knew you looked familiar.
- He tortures people

1197
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:12,512
- with electric shocks.
- That isn't accurate.

1198
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,430
He's very controversial.

1199
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,808
Have you read my book?
Have you?

1200
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:19,227
I don't get a chance to read as
much as I would like to.

1201
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,312
- It's okay.
- I read the review.

1202
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,980
Well, there were many reviews.

1203
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,401
It was the Times, wasn't it?
Harsh.

1204
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,569
Yes, it was. It was harsh.

1205
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,572
It was nominated for an award,
but, yeah, who cares?

1206
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,199
Why disabuse yourself?

1207
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,159
What?

1208
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,662
I don't wanna make you angry,
ma'am. Just...

1209
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,498
have a nice day, okay?

1210
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,000
Abe, it was a pleasure
meeting you.

1211
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,847
I was bowled over when I first
read about it,

1212
01:13:56,056 --> 01:14:00,601
and you in the Times,
and then I read the original material

1213
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,895
and the scientific journals,
and I mulled.

1214
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,022
- You mulled?
- I mulled.

1215
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:09,235
This mulling produced the idea
to do a TV play

1216
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:12,989
of a hopefully high caliber,
for an accepted show,

1217
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:16,492
of a decently adult level,
treating, in fictional form,

1218
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:19,287
the kind of experiments you
performed and its aftermath.

1219
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,248
Using it as a springboard for
my own characters

1220
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,042
and situational inventions.

1221
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:28,129
I, uh, I kept this.

1222
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,090
D'you see how yellow?

1223
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,428
Stan, sorry, help me.
I was just wondering.

1224
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,680
Your name, its derivation?

1225
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,683
Milgram means "pomegranate"
in Hebrew.

1226
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,144
It's one of the seven fruits of
the Bible. I'm Jewish,

1227
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:45,605
if that's what you're asking?

1228
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:47,398
Apples is another, right?

1229
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,276
Figs, grapes.
Olives, they're a fruit?

1230
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:55,406
Anyhow, when you point out
the parallels, the connections,

1231
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:58,868
Hannah Arendt,
The Banality of Evil,

1232
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:03,498
the My Lai massacre, all of that,
I see where you're coming from.

1233
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,959
I'm here because a serious
situation is pending

1234
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,504
with regard to the drama I propose.

1235
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:14,884
Playhouse 90, the Columbia
Broadcasting System.

1236
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:16,844
CBS.

1237
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:35,571
Michele, ma belle. Ca va?

1238
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,281
Hi.

1239
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,159
I was just gonna get
some ice cream.

1240
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:03,140
Whenever I'm up late like this,
which is a lot,

1241
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:05,726
I think of your grandfather.

1242
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,437
- Sam?
- Yeah, that was his name.

1243
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,689
Yeah.

1244
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,066
He died.

1245
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,946
That's right, in his sleep.
It's the luckiest way, people say,

1246
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,447
not to know what's happening.

1247
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,951
Why... Why did he die?

1248
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,369
Hmm.

1249
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:26,080
Heart disease.

1250
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:30,835
It was before you were born,
before your mother could meet him.

1251
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:36,007
He was a baker,
his specialty were cakes.

1252
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,050
- He worked late.
- Mmm-hmm.

1253
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,308
I got it from him.
Maybe you'll get it from me.

1254
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,727
Basically there are
three types of people.

1255
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:50,271
That's what
your research confirms.

1256
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:53,441
There's the person
who makes things happen,

1257
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,985
the person who
watches things happen,

1258
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,863
then the person who says,
"What happened?"

1259
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,866
Right?

1260
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,662
I'm a dramatist, I was explicit,
not a scientist.

1261
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:11,417
Your work is a springboard for
revealing basic human truths.

1262
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:15,254
You get your consultant's fee.
What's the problem?

1263
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,881
It isn't about the money.

1264
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,722
I'm sorry, she needs
to speak to you again.

1265
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,098
She says it's urgent.

1266
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,269
Tell her to relax.

1267
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,362
Excuse me.

1268
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:20,986
Dr. Stanley?

1269
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:24,198
Yes?

1270
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,493
Mr. Bellak won't be back
in his office this afternoon.

1271
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,121
Excuse me?

1272
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:32,498
He can't talk to you today anymore.

1273
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:35,084
He says you can visit the set.

1274
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:39,714
Okay.

1275
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:57,314
So, you sold him the rights?

1276
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:02,611
No. But it's a gray area.

1277
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,991
But it's your book, it's your work,
it's your experiments.

1278
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:10,369
So either you did it or you sold it
or you didn't. Right?

1279
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:13,205
In the opinion of
Harper's legal department,

1280
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:16,125
we don't have a supportable claim,
not on the basis of

1281
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,670
copyright infringement,
because the show is fiction.

1282
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,672
Are we finished with this?

1283
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,800
They gave me a consulting fee.
Is that enough?

1284
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,763
Your father's turning into
a fictional character.

1285
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,806
- Why?
- Yes, why?

1286
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:32,534
And why do they have
to make you a goy?

1287
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,852
It's not about me.
I'm just a springboard.

1288
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,313
- Why?
- I don't know.

1289
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:41,525
Oh, I see.
So, you had no choice?

1290
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:45,029
I could just give the money back
but they'd make the show anyway.

1291
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,364
Why don't I give the money back?

1292
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,825
I'll give the money back!
That's a good idea.

1293
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:52,536
You know what?
You don't have to be so snippy.

1294
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,174
They don't just come in

1295
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:07,510
and sadistically pull these switches.
Bing. Bing.

1296
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:10,554
They have an inner struggle
not to obey.

1297
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,600
Their inner pain is
the evidence to that.

1298
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:16,977
Steven, what you're doing
is very important,

1299
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:19,438
and I love the design.
It's audacious.

1300
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,275
And?

1301
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:27,571
I am being careful, which is why
I've got tenure around here

1302
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:29,824
long before black
became popular.

1303
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:33,285
It's tricky. Very tricky.

1304
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,455
There'll be criticism of
anything breaking new ground.

1305
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:39,959
There are times when
your life resembles a bad movie,

1306
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:43,963
but nothing prepares you if your life
actually becomes a bad movie.

1307
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,716
Here's Dr. Steven Turner,
Steven/Stanley, Turner/Milgram,

1308
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:51,804
of Rutledge University,
a bachelor and a WASP,

1309
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,348
being played by William Shatner,

1310
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,935
four years after
his last Star Trek episode.

1311
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:01,313
Ossie Davis plays his colleague
and best friend.

1312
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:05,526
I don't believe you're
adequately considering...

1313
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,112
faculty reaction.

1314
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,532
You may find yourself teaching
in Siberia.

1315
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,463
This has to be somewhat weird
for you.

1316
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:32,011
Well, I've made some films
myself actually.

1317
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:33,387
Documentaries.

1318
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:37,016
I think Ossie may have meant,
and I was wondering also,

1319
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:41,812
do you have a best friend
who is, you know, a brother?

1320
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:47,401
I mean this tradition of
a black best friend,

1321
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,820
where did that come from?

1322
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:52,281
You don't have
a black best friend, Bill?

1323
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,533
No. Do you?

1324
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:58,621
This character isn't me.
I'm just a springboard.

1325
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:02,541
Did you know I did the first
interracial kiss in US TV history?

1326
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,252
Ah, Star Trek, sure.

1327
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,006
I kissed Nichelle Nichols on
network TV.

1328
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:12,301
Controversial, but you did it.

1329
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,220
The network was... nervous.

1330
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,349
They insisted we shoot
an alternative version,

1331
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:22,061
but during the close up
I did this...

1332
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:31,153
First time, 1968,
in the history of TV.

1333
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:36,825
I've read about
your experiments, Doctor.

1334
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,998
Did you happen to use
any black folks?

1335
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,416
Yes, of course.

1336
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,129
And the results?

1337
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:51,966
They fared the same as
everyone else.

1338
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,551
Roughly 65 percent compliant.

1339
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,096
You didn't force or
threaten anyone, right?

1340
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:59,139
- No.
- You didn't twist anyone's arm?

1341
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,059
- No, no.
- Didn't hold a gun to anyone's head?

1342
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,437
You see, it brings to mind when
I was six or seven years old,

1343
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:06,897
coming home from school.

1344
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:10,693
Two policemen call me over
from their car.

1345
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:14,405
"Come over here, boy.
Come on over."

1346
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,241
- Have I heard this one?
- No.

1347
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:20,244
They tell me to get into the car,

1348
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,079
and they take me
to the precinct station.

1349
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:26,542
Then one of them
takes a jar of cane syrup

1350
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,002
and pours it over my head.

1351
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:33,215
And they both laugh like it's
the funniest thing in the world.

1352
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:35,175
I laugh too.

1353
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:40,639
Then they give me hunks of
peanut brittle and let me go.

1354
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:45,060
It took me 30 years
before I told anyone.

1355
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,481
Where was this, Ossie?
Down South?

1356
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:51,734
Well, it doesn't matter where,
and that's my point.

1357
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,028
You don't have to go to Germany

1358
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,405
to learn about
obedience to authority.

1359
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,782
This in the book. Actually,
it's the tenth chapter,

1360
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:02,202
- which very few people get to.
- The Tenth Level.

1361
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:06,331
The agentic state,
in which the demands of

1362
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:09,668
the democratically installed
authority conflict with conscience.

1363
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:11,628
The Banality of Evil.

1364
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:18,052
I don't take responsibility.
Do you take responsibility?

1365
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:20,888
I take responsibility.
Now count that as wrong.

1366
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:23,057
No response counts as wrong.

1367
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,704
You pull the switch then, dammit!
Come on, you pull the switch!

1368
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,020
Mr. Dahlquist, that's your job.

1369
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:31,398
No, I won't.

1370
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,525
Nobody can learn anything
like this.

1371
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:37,738
There was a time, I suspect,
when men and women

1372
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,616
could give a fully human
response to any situation.

1373
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:44,286
When we could be fully absorbed
in the world as human beings.

1374
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,914
But more often, now,

1375
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,292
people don't get to see
the whole situation

1376
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,127
but only some small part of it.

1377
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:55,547
There's a division of labor,
and people carry out small,

1378
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:57,633
narrow, specialized jobs,

1379
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:01,512
and we can't act without some
kind of direction from on high.

1380
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,265
I call this "the agentic state".

1381
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:08,435
The individual yields to authority,

1382
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:12,064
and in doing so becomes
alienated from his own actions.

1383
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:15,776
Mr. Dahlquist,
you agreed to the rules.

1384
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:19,279
The agentic state is "store policy".

1385
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,824
It's, "I'm just doing my job."

1386
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:25,369
Or, "That's not my job."

1387
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:28,539
Or, "I don't make the rules."
"We don't do that here."

1388
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:32,251
"Just following orders."
"It's the law."

1389
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,546
In the agentic state,
the individual defines himself

1390
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:38,507
as an instrument carrying out
the wishes of others.

1391
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:41,510
A soldier, a nurse,
an administrator.

1392
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,011
An actor.

1393
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:48,183
A corporate employee, or even,
yes, academics and artists.

1394
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:52,062
- Please continue.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

1395
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:54,690
- Mr. Dahlquist?
- Just shut up a minute!

1396
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,192
Now, hold on.

1397
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:04,158
- Come on, come on.
- Son of a bitch!

1398
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:07,244
A person has a choice.

1399
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:10,330
He or she chooses
to become agentic.

1400
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:15,586
But once you assume the role,
it's almost impossible to go back.

1401
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,006
Wrong.

1402
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:21,842
A hundred
and ninety five volts.

1403
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,386
"Dance."

1404
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,015
Let me out of here! Let me out!

1405
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,184
- Continue, please.
- We always asked,

1406
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:32,060
"Is there anything
the man could've said

1407
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:34,104
to stop you from administering
the shocks?"

1408
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,607
And they'd always say,
"No, I don't think so. No."

1409
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,233
I told you
I have a heart condition!

1410
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:48,327
Michele.

1411
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:50,579
Sit up here. All right?

1412
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,084
Could we get a couple of
hot chocolates?

1413
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:57,812
- You want hot chocolate?
- Yes, please.

1414
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:00,088
- Hot chocolates all around?
- Yeah, yeah.

1415
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:02,799
Do you want anything?
Okay, no, we're fine.

1416
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,595
I need you to stay put,
stay in your seats. Okay?

1417
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:18,273
I'm sorry.

1418
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:23,028
I could say it a thousand times
and mean it every time.

1419
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:28,242
Marc, turn around in your seat.

1420
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,084
Piaget.

1421
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:43,048
You remember when
I was translating Piaget?

1422
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:48,053
I hit this line about
child development.

1423
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:54,142
It's the specific point when
the growing child is able

1424
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:58,272
to recognize a gap between what
exists and what might exist.

1425
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,566
And it occurred to me,
we choose our reality

1426
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:03,360
when we choose another person.

1427
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,198
What does that mean?

1428
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,368
Marriage is not a fantasy.

1429
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:15,580
No, no, no, right.

1430
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,416
Right.

1431
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,211
But it is a choice.

1432
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:28,093
You have to know that I choose you.

1433
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:32,014
Every day I choose you.

1434
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:46,153
1984.

1435
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:49,072
1984 was a big year for me.

1436
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:51,825
My lecture fees peaked,
I was asked to speak

1437
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,995
all over the world, about
the obedience experiments,

1438
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,874
of course, in relation to
Orwell's prophetic book.

1439
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,711
A book that describes
a totalitarian world

1440
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:05,464
where people aren't very good
at thinking for themselves.

1441
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:15,557
♪ Who can explain it? ♪

1442
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:18,268
♪ Who can tell you why ♪

1443
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:21,146
♪ Fools give you reasons ♪

1444
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:28,111
♪ Wise men never try ♪

1445
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,784
1984 was also the year
that I died.

1446
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,171
I was 51.

1447
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,264
Excuse me? We need to see
a doctor immediately.

1448
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:59,601
I'm Stanley Milgram.
This is my ID.

1449
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,728
I believe I'm having
my fifth heart attack.

1450
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,399
Dr. Heissenbuttel...

1451
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:07,692
That's who treated me last time.

1452
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,861
You need to fill this out.

1453
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:11,655
The agentic personality.

1454
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,966
No one can truly know
what they might or might not do

1455
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:20,348
when presented with the demands
of a particular situation.

1456
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:24,269
In 2008, a professor at Santa
Clara University replicated

1457
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:28,356
the obedience experiments and
got roughly the same results.

1458
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:31,401
Over 60 percent of volunteers
delivered the full shocks.

1459
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:34,988
In 2010, the experiments
were duplicated

1460
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,324
on a French reality TV show,

1461
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:40,076
Le Jeu de la Mort,
The Game of Death.

1462
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:43,246
Participants were egged on by
a live studio audience.

1463
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,832
Over 80 percent went all the way.

1464
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:57,093
Alexandra Milgram, Sasha,

1465
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:59,346
continues to live in
the apartment we shared

1466
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:03,099
in Riverdale. Our children live
with their children

1467
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:04,976
near Boston and Toronto.

1468
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,896
Sasha never remarried.

1469
01:32:13,736 --> 01:32:16,112
The obedience experiments are
cited and discussed

1470
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:20,283
in nearly every introductory
psychology textbook worldwide.

1471
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,578
My obedience film is screened

1472
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:25,956
for every incoming class
at West Point.

1473
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:30,252
And my methods and results
continue to be challenged,

1474
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:32,295
scorned, debunked,

1475
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:35,173
yet every time a new outrage is
unleashed into the world,

1476
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,093
sanctioned and systematic acts
of violence,

1477
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,971
the obedience experiments
re-enter the conversation,

1478
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,265
re-framing unanswerable questions.

1479
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:47,060
You could say we're puppets.

1480
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:53,608
But I believe that we are puppets
with perception,

1481
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,193
with awareness.

1482
01:32:55,361 --> 01:33:00,574
Sometimes we can see the strings
and, perhaps,

1483
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:04,202
our awareness is the first step
in our liberation.
