1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,969
(playful music)

2
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,029
(alarm blaring)
(gasping)

3
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,264
(thudding)

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,434
- Jenny!

5
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:13,005
- Thanks.

6
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,542
- Jenny, you mess with my
  alarm clock one more time

7
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,244
it's gonna be the
  last thing you do.

8
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,812
- What'd I do?
  - Oh, don't give me that.

9
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:21,114
- She turned up the
 volume on my radio.

10
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,516
It's lucky I can even hear.

11
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,151
- Jenny, you know better.

12
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,819
- I was just playing
 a little joke.

13
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,187
- Not like those we don't.

14
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:29,889
- Yeah, I'd like to see
you try it again, kiddo.

15
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,991
- Scare me.
  - Yeah, you'll be scared.

16
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,726
- All right, you two.

17
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,596
- You were out kind
 of late last night.

18
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,830
- Yeah, I was helping
 a friend study

19
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,599
for a big English
 test we've got today.

20
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,033
- He was helping Tamara.

21
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,502
- Jenny.

22
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,769
- Tamara?

23
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,238
- She's just a
 friend from school.

24
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,939
- Danny's in love with her.

25
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,174
- Will you be quiet?

26
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,243
- Danny and Tamara,
 sittin' in a tree.

27
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,577
- Dad, shut her up.

28
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:53,446
- That's enough comedy, Jenny.

29
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,548
- Go finish getting
 ready for school.

30
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,382
- Okay.

31
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,487
- Well, how's it going with her?

32
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:02,622
- You know, Dad,
 everybody just sees me

33
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,223
as a nice guy, that's all.

34
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:06,225
Nobody wants to
  date a, you know,

35
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,460
my tombstone's gonna read,

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,862
"Here lies Dan Burgess,
a real nice guy,

37
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,464
"and a lonely one, too."

38
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,766
- Oh, come on, Son,
  you'll meet the right one.

39
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,601
Just be patient.

40
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,436
- Yeah, patience.

41
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:19,438
- K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

42
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:20,606
- [All] Jenny!

43
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,511
(gentle music)

44
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,497
(engine idling)

45
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,167
(gentle music)

46
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,441
(engine revving)

47
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,245
(gentle music)

48
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,993
- Hey, Mrs. Moore.
  - Hi, Dan.

49
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,164
(gentle music)

50
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:05,511
(car door opening and closing)

51
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,388
- So how did it go?

52
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,322
- What do you mean?

53
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,189
- Last night, with Tamara.

54
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,424
- What? We studied.

55
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,392
- Come on, man, you
 know what I mean.

56
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,060
- I said we studied.

57
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,996
- Hey, Burgess.

58
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,364
Gonna let me cheat off you
 in that English test today?

59
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:26,832
- Oh, I hadn't
 planned on it, Doug.

60
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,134
- Why don't you ask Mr. Milner.

61
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,537
I'm sure he won't
  mind if you ask.

62
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,272
- Doug really gets
  to me sometimes.

63
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,640
- You know Doug.

64
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,942
- I mean, I don't
 understand it, he mocks God,

65
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,410
yet he gets all the girls.

66
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,245
He's got a great car,
  everyone bows down to him.

67
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,746
He's got it all.

68
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:41,847
- No, man, Doug's got nothing
 if you don't have the Lord.

69
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:42,682
- Yeah, right.

70
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,150
I'll see you in class.

71
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,320
- We need to keep
 trying to reach him.

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,754
- Come on, Ricky, we're
not affecting Doug

73
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,222
or any of those guys.

74
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:53,893
They just see us as a couple
of goody-two-shoes, that's all.

75
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,464
(students chatting)

76
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,299
- [Tamara] Thanks for
 helping me last night.

77
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,467
- Tamara.

78
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,568
- I'd seriously
 flunk this test today

79
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,803
if you hadn't helped me.

80
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,971
- Oh, don't worry,
 you're gonna do great.

81
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,441
- Well I want you to know
  I really appreciate it.

82
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,178
- Um, Tamara, I was wondering
 if um, after school--

83
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,613
- Tammy, baby, you're
 looking good today.

84
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:15,881
- Doug.

85
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,416
- You going to Randy's
 party tomorrow night?

86
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,684
- I wouldn't miss it.

87
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:19,919
- What about you,
  Danny, you coming?

88
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,954
- Uh, I don't know,
 I don't think so.

89
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,122
- Oh, what's the matter,
Mommy won't let you out

90
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,056
on a school night?

91
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,091
- No, no, no, Burgess has got to

92
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,659
get his rest for the weekend.

93
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,493
What you got coming up, buddy?

94
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,694
Big church hayride?

95
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:29,962
(laughing)

96
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,163
Come on, Tammy.

97
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:34,533
Tammy, after the party,
we'll get together.

98
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,536
(students chatting)

99
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,343
- It is my lady,
  oh, it is my love.

100
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,112
Oh, that she knew she was.

101
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,646
- Hey, Mr. Milner.

102
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:49,682
- Take my counsel, comrade,
 be careful with young love.

103
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,417
- Yeah, but Tamara's
 special, Mr. Milner.

104
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,918
- I guess we'll see.

105
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,153
- Tough test today?

106
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,221
- It'll be a little
 bit of everything.

107
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,956
Essay, matching,
multiple choice,

108
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,192
connect the dots,
  find the bunny.

109
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,028
(uplifting music)

110
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,338
- So how's FCA going?

111
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,540
- Hmm?

112
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,108
- Fellowship of
 Christian Athletes?

113
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,376
- Oh, good.

114
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,644
We're showing a film
 after school Friday.

115
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,646
- Well I hope you
  get some response.

116
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,880
- What?

117
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,582
- I said I hope you
 get some response.

118
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,850
- Yeah, me too.

119
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,355
- What are you looking at?

120
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:04,757
- He's got the hots for Tamara.

121
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,025
- Tamara Howard?

122
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,126
- Thanks, Todd.

123
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,627
- He wants to ask her out.

124
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:09,762
- Cool it, Todd.

125
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,629
- I told you to forget it, man.

126
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,031
She's after Doug.

127
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,299
- Cool it, Todd.

128
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,433
- Besides, she
 won't date you, Dan.

129
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,668
You're too nice of a guy.

130
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,736
Tamara's not in the
 market for nice guys.

131
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:19,071
- Cool it, Todd.

132
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,374
- Okay.

133
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,450
- Tammy, baby.

134
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,556
- Come on, Ricky,
 let's get out of here.

135
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,762
- I like nice guys.

136
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:48,434
- Hey, Mike.
 - Hey.

137
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,404
(kids chatting)

138
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,481
- What's wrong, Bull?

139
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,417
- That punk's trying
 to steal my girl.

140
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,687
- Ricky?

141
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,123
- I saw him staring at Melanie
 while she was at her locker.

142
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,691
- Bull, I don't think
 anybody in their right mind

143
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:14,527
is trying to steal your girl.

144
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,761
- But I saw him.

145
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,129
- Bull, you're gonna
 drive yourself crazy.

146
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,697
You can't go around
 suspecting everybody

147
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,466
who looks or talks to Melanie.

148
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,903
I mean, I even talk
 to her now and then.

149
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,838
What I mean, Bull, is
  that if you love Melanie,

150
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,806
and she loves you, then you
 have to trust one another.

151
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,708
If you don't this trust, then
 you don't have true love,

152
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,210
and it won't last.

153
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,482
- You think so?

154
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,983
- I know so, Bull.

155
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:41,353
When you trust you remove
  all those jealous fears.

156
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,289
- You got a roving
  eye, little man.

157
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,190
If I ever catch you
  looking at Melanie again,

158
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,926
you're dog meat, pal.

159
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,296
We'll talk more later.

160
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,363
- Sure, Bull.

161
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,366
- All right, now the
 principal's ok'd us

162
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,568
to put these posters up,

163
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,603
so let's get them up right away.

164
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,538
Now look, we gotta get some
 guys to come to this thing,

165
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,840
'cause it's really gonna make
 them think about eternity.

166
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,075
Do all the teams know about it?

167
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,410
- Yeah, I told the
 basketball players.

168
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,045
- I got football.
  - Baseball knows.

169
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,581
- What about wrestlers?
 - I'm gonna tell them today.

170
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,615
- Come on, man, what
 have you been doing?

171
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,549
The film's Friday.

172
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,017
What are you waiting for?

173
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:14,653
- I'll tell them today.

174
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:15,921
- All right.

175
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:17,256
I'm sorry, Nick.

176
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,558
All right, meet back
  here tomorrow, same time,

177
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,360
and we'll pray about this thing.

178
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,362
That's it, guys, thanks.

179
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,699
- You okay, buddy?

180
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,634
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

181
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,906
(students chatting)

182
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,649
- Hi, Lucy.
 - Hey.

183
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,783
- Do you know where Scotty is?

184
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,185
- Yeah, he's right over there.

185
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,353
- Thanks, bye.

186
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,423
(students chatting)

187
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,700
Hey, Scotty.
 - Hey, Dan.

188
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,168
The Bible's coming alive to me,

189
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,403
I just can't get enough of it.

190
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,372
- That's great,
  I'm happy for you.

191
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,640
Listen, I can't
 meet with you today.

192
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,775
I have to take care of a
couple of things, okay?

193
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,243
- Oh, okay.

194
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,811
- But I promise I'll meet
 with you tomorrow, same time.

195
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,180
I'll do my best to answer any
 of your questions, all right?

196
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,282
- All right, that's fine.

197
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,282
- Thanks, buddy.

198
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:19,618
I'll talk to you later.

199
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,687
- Hey, Dan?
 - Yeah?

200
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,755
- Jesus, man.

201
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,266
- Now's your best shot, buddy.

202
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,768
- I don't know, Ricky.

203
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,302
- Listen, Dan, it's not
 like you're gonna marry her.

204
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,837
You just want to take
  her to get a bite to eat.

205
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:39,872
It's not even a date.

206
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,340
- Why am I so nervous?

207
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,509
- Go on, get it over with.

208
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,945
- Okay, I'm going.

209
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:51,483
- Besides, if she
  shoots you down,

210
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,419
your troubles are over.

211
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,231
- Hey, Tamara.

212
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:07,733
- I'm really nervous.

213
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,802
- Oh, don't worry about the
 test, you're gonna ace it.

214
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,603
- I just hope I pass.

215
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,806
- Um, Tamara, I was wondering,

216
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,574
if you're not gonna be
 busy tomorrow night.

217
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,076
- Well, yeah, I'm
going to Randy's party.

218
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,344
Aren't you going?

219
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,179
- Uh, no, I don't think so.

220
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,281
- You're gonna
  miss a great time.

221
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,782
- Well what about this weekend?

222
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:24,616
Uh...

223
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,087
- Dan, are you
 trying to ask me out?

224
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,656
- No, no, I, I, I just
 thought that maybe

225
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,257
we could get a bit to eat
  and talk a little bit.

226
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:35,160
- Listen, Dan, we're
 good friends, right?

227
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,595
- Yeah.

228
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,431
- Well I wouldn't want anything
to ruin our friendship.

229
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:41,033
I mean, you're a real nice guy.

230
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,802
Some girl is gonna be
really lucky to get you.

231
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:45,637
- I understand, Tamara.

232
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,339
- See you in class.

233
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,242
(melancholy music)

234
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,446
- All right, students,
it's time for all of you

235
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:56,348
to destroy my waning faith

236
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,784
in the American
 educational system.

237
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,053
It's time for me to
  realize that there's about

238
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,422
as much interest in
 English literature

239
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,658
as there is in taking
 prune juice, huh?

240
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,962
Huh?

241
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,664
Huh?
 (students laughing)

242
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:16,268
Everyone will keep his
 eyes on his own test.

243
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,102
You have 40 minutes.

244
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:17,936
- Tamara.

245
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,874
(suspenseful music)

246
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,155
- Tamara.

247
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:40,426
(suspenseful music)

248
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,363
Give it to Tamara, come on.

249
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:48,967
Come on.

250
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,638
Tamara?

251
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,140
(suspenseful music)

252
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,974
- Tamara?

253
00:12:57,075 --> 00:13:00,078
(suspenseful music)

254
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,792
Tamara?

255
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,327
Tamara?

256
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,862
- [Mr. Milner] What's that
  in your hand, Mr. Burgess?

257
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,397
- I, I, I don't know, sir, I
 just found it on the floor.

258
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,898
I thought it fell
  off Tamara's desk.

259
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,800
- These are the answers to
 the multiple choice questions.

260
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,602
You were trying to help
  Tamara cheat, weren't you?

261
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,536
- No, Mr. Milner.

262
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:25,804
I just found it on the floor.

263
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,039
I thought it fell
  off Tamara's desk.

264
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,040
- [Mr. Milner] Come
 with me, Mr. Burgess.

265
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,107
- But, Mr. Milner, I--

266
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:31,977
- [Mr. Milner] Come with me.

267
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,178
- I was doing all right.

268
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,446
I didn't need your help.

269
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,380
- [Dan] I wasn't
 trying to help you--

270
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,548
- Mr. Burgess!

271
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,458
I want you to take this note
 to the principal's office.

272
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,392
- Mr. Milner, I can explain--

273
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:48,660
- You'd given me hope, Dan.

274
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,128
I actually thought you
 weren't like the rest.

275
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,698
That perhaps your faith had
given you some sound principles.

276
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,933
But I see now how easily
 you were ready to sell them

277
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,401
for some teenage crush.

278
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,637
- Mr. Milner, please,
  would you let me explain.

279
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,471
Please...

280
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,343
(door slamming)

281
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,277
- But how could
  you get suspended?

282
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,511
- It's a bum rap, I told you.

283
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:07,880
- You should have never
picked up that paper.

284
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,181
- How was I to know what it was?

285
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,016
- Son, you need to
  be more careful.

286
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,618
- I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

287
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,952
- Well think next time.

288
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,153
- I'll tell you,
Dad, I'm fed up.

289
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,889
I don't know how
 much more I can take.

290
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,156
You know what's going
 on tomorrow night?

291
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:19,691
A big party at Randy's house.

292
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,393
Everybody's gonna be there
  except for me, of course,

293
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,794
because I'm too good to go.

294
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,196
- A lot of kids won't be there.

295
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,430
- Yeah, a bunch of nerds.

296
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,665
- Is Ricky a nerd?

297
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,200
Come on, Son, we've
 talked about this.

298
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,434
- And Tamara, Dad?

299
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:30,369
I think she'd go out
 with me if I lived

300
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,537
on the edge a little more.

301
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,771
Dan, you're a really nice guy.

302
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,706
Some girl's really gonna
be lucky to get you.

303
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,008
- Come on, Son.

304
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,743
- I'm not impacting
anyone for Christ, Dad.

305
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,745
They just see me as the
nice guy, that's all.

306
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,413
I'm not affecting
  anyone for Jesus.

307
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,415
- You're just feeling
 sorry for yourself.

308
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,616
- No, I'm missing all the fun.

309
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:47,252
- No, you're
 missing all the sin.

310
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:50,289
- Yeah, maybe so,
  but I'm fed up.

311
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,759
- Look, you'll feel
 better in the morning.

312
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,693
Good night.

313
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,630
(door opening and closing)

314
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,801
- Yeah, things are really gonna
be different in the morning.

315
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:10,108
(paper rustling)

316
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,179
- [Doug voiceover]
 Oh, what's the matter?

317
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,714
Mommy won't let you
 out on a school night?

318
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,783
No, no, no, Burgess has got to
 get his rest for the weekend.

319
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,218
What you got coming up,
  buddy, big church hayride?

320
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:21,453
- [Tamara] I mean,
you're a real nice guy.

321
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,657
Some girl is gonna be
really lucky to get you.

322
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:28,794
- Why do they get
 to have all the fun?

323
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,296
I wish I was never a believer.

324
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,833
(bells ringing)

325
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,404
(mysterious music)

326
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,538
(chiming)

327
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,913
(light music playing)

328
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:24,149
(groaning)

329
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,123
(clattering)

330
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:38,563
- Oh, oh.

331
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,940
(groaning)

332
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:55,180
(thudding)

333
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:58,850
Mom? Dad?

334
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,259
Thanks for letting
  me use your car.

335
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,528
I'll be home by 5:00, love, Mom.

336
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,064
PS, I made you some biscuits.

337
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,932
(tapping)

338
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,933
What a mess.

339
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,345
(chiming)

340
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:30,082
(trash rustling)

341
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,584
- Hello, Daniel.

342
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,486
- Oh, you startled me.

343
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,787
What can I do for you?

344
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:37,556
- I've been sent
  to talk with you.

345
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,058
- Oh, look, whatever you're
 selling, I'm not buying.

346
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,493
- I'm not selling
  anything, Daniel.

347
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,663
I'm here to talk with
 you about your prayer.

348
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,664
- My prayer?

349
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,399
- Yes, your prayer last night.

350
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,633
The one where you had wished

351
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:51,069
that you'd never
  become a believer.

352
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,971
- What are you talking about?

353
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,539
- Your prayer's been
 answered, Daniel.

354
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,475
Today you're a man of the world.

355
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,409
- Who are you?

356
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,877
- My name is Muriel.

357
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,212
I've been sent to tell
  you that your life is now

358
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,180
as if you've never been saved,

359
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,383
as if you've never received
 the Lord into your life.

360
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,318
- Look, what's going on here?

361
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,919
Did Ricky put you up to this?

362
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,055
- You complained that your
friends were having all the fun.

363
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,524
Now's your chance to see
  what you've been missing.

364
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,759
- Yeah, well, I do
 feel like I have a lot

365
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,926
of restrictions on me.

366
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,361
(horn honking)

367
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,396
- Your new friends are
 here to pick you up.

368
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:20,365
(horn honking)

369
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,800
Better hurry, Daniel,

370
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,702
your friends aren't
  known for their patience.

371
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,103
- Yo, Danny boy, man, let's go.

372
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,404
- Hurry up, man, we
 need to get there.

373
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:27,339
- Come on, what are you doing?

374
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,173
Come on!

375
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,143
- What's going on here?

376
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,477
- [Randy] What are
  you looking at?

377
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:33,678
- [Doug] Who are you talking to?

378
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:34,880
Come on!

379
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,149
- Your friends can't
 see me, Daniel.

380
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,984
And they're about to leave you.

381
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,720
(engine revving)

382
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,032
- [Doug] It's party
 time tonight, huh?

383
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,735
- Yeah, man, we got enough
 booze to fill Lake Michigan.

384
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,470
- Hi, Mrs. Moore.

385
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,206
- Hey, babe, why don't you
 come to Randy's party tonight?

386
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,108
We got a six pack
 of Geritol for you.

387
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,377
(laughing)

388
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,512
- Delinquents.

389
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,323
- All right, remember, we're
 cutting fifth period early

390
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,758
so we can go to the
 lake, all right?

391
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,026
We're gonna meet right
 here at the jeep.

392
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,060
- Yeah, I'll be waiting
for you right here, man.

393
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,061
- All right.

394
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,997
Yo, man, do you think
 those girls will show?

395
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:26,831
- What girls?

396
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:27,766
- (scoffing) What girls.

397
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,234
- The ones we met last night.

398
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,502
- Oh.

399
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,937
- What's wrong with you,
man, you sleep too long?

400
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:32,604
- Well if they don't
  they're either too stupid

401
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,838
or not worth it.

402
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,580
(thudding)

403
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,924
- Hey, Vicky.

404
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,192
Going to Randy's party tonight?

405
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,160
- That one, what a dud.

406
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,394
- Oh, what's the matter?

407
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:57,929
Mommy won't let you
 out on a school night?

408
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,764
- No, no, no, no, she's gotta
 get her rest for this weekend.

409
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:02,667
Hey, what you got coming up,
 babe, a big church hayride?

410
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,769
(laughing)

411
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:06,037
- Hi, Vicky.

412
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,439
- How come you didn't call me?

413
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,274
- Tamara.
 - Bye, lover.

414
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,508
Stud boy.

415
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:11,810
- What time are you
 picking me up tonight?

416
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,011
- Picking you up?

417
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,547
- For Randy's party.
 - Randy's party.

418
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,982
- Don't tell me
 you're not taking me.

419
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,118
- No, no, I'll pick
 you up around 7:30?

420
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,386
- Make it 7:00.

421
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:24,856
Bye.

422
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,161
- I thought we
  were only friends.

423
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:32,731
(upbeat music)

424
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,197
- Hey, man.
 - Hey.

425
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:21,313
- Hey, Mike, you seen Ricky?

426
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,247
- What do you mean?

427
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,381
- Do you know where Ricky is?

428
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,616
- Come on, man, you know.

429
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,450
- Know what?

430
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,351
- He's in the hospital.

431
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,886
- Hospital, for what?

432
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,954
- You saw Bull bust him
  up yesterday after school.

433
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:31,222
- Bull?

434
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:32,190
- Yeah, he nearly killed
him 'cause he thought

435
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,591
Ricky was messing with Melanie.

436
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:35,093
- What?

437
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,428
- Why am I telling you
  this for, you were there.

438
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,896
Man, they should
 have put Bull in jail

439
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:42,167
instead of just suspending
  him for two weeks.

440
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,302
(chiming)

441
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:47,672
- All right, listen, we only
 got a couple of minutes,

442
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,341
so let's get this thing going.

443
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,709
What, what's this?

444
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,377
- Pardon, Mr. Burgess?

445
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,645
- What's this?

446
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,779
- It's our class.

447
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:55,714
- But we're supposed
 to be having

448
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,948
our FCA meeting here right now.

449
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,216
- FCA?

450
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,684
- The Fellowship of
 Christian Athletes.

451
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:00,919
We're having a
 prayer meeting here

452
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,487
for the film after
  school tomorrow.

453
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,789
- Well as you can see,
this is Home Economics.

454
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,424
- But it's supposed to be FCA.

455
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:08,793
- You have three seconds to
 get out of here, Mr. Burgess.

456
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:09,694
- But Mrs. Meyer--

457
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:10,695
- One--
 - Would you--

458
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:13,198
- Two--
- All right, I'm going.

459
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,469
(students laughing)

460
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,637
(chiming)

461
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,075
- There is no FCA.

462
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,612
- You again.

463
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,980
- You see, Daniel, you
  weren't here to start it,

464
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,582
so there is no FCA.

465
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,516
- What are you talking about?

466
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,484
We just had a meeting in--

467
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,019
- It's like your friend, Ricky.

468
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,587
You didn't try to calm Bull down

469
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,555
in class yesterday
 when he was jealous,

470
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:40,492
because you're not sensitive
 to those things anymore.

471
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,094
So yesterday after school,
  Bull beat Ricky up.

472
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:44,329
- Look, uh--
 - Muriel.

473
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,831
- Muriel, level with me,
what's going on here?

474
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,466
- I already told you, Daniel.

475
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:51,536
The Heavenly Father answered
 your prayer last night.

476
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,906
Today your life is as if
 you'd never become a believer.

477
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,374
- This is crazy.

478
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,942
Look, Ricky and those
  guys are up to something.

479
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,177
Come on, tell me
  what's going on--

480
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,111
- [Mr. Callahan]
  What are you doing

481
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:01,379
out of class, Mr. Burgess?

482
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,580
- Mr. Callahan, I
  was just talking--

483
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,481
- Let's go, Mr. Burgess,
let's get to class.

484
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:04,315
Let's go.

485
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,218
Troublemaker.

486
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:09,888
- What did the
  guys say about me.

487
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,822
I want to know what
 they're saying.

488
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,857
I want to hear every detail.

489
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:13,691
(students chatting)

490
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:14,692
He's so sexy.

491
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:16,561
(students chatting)

492
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,329
- Has he called you yet?
- No.

493
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:21,332
(students chatting)

494
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:32,310
(chiming)

495
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:37,382
- Hey, Danny, Danny, wait up!

496
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,017
- Melanie.
  - Talk to me for a minute.

497
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,518
- I'd like to, but I'm
gonna be late for class.

498
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:41,519
- Oh, well just for a minute.

499
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,620
- What's wrong?

500
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,189
- Come over tonight.
 - What?

501
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,890
- I really need to see you.

502
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,126
- Uh, I can't do
 that, what about Bull?

503
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,829
- Forget Bull, my
 folks will be gone.

504
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,163
- I'm gonna be late
 for class, Melanie.

505
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,566
- Please, Danny.
- I gotta go.

506
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,301
- Call me.

507
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,437
- Miss Porter.

508
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,271
Gamund.

509
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,174
Turnbull.

510
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:04,008
Howard.

511
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:05,944
Llewellyn.

512
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,179
Burgess.

513
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:13,952
And how do you explain
 four perfect scores

514
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,753
from you characters?

515
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:17,388
- We studied. (snickering)

516
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:20,191
- Don't press your
  luck, Turnbull.

517
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,264
- What a crank.

518
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,265
I wonder where Milner is.

519
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,600
- Milner?

520
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,535
- Yeah, Mr. Milner?

521
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,804
- He doesn't work here anymore.

522
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,372
- What, Milner's gone?

523
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,575
- Danny boy, man, you smoke
 some bad weed this morning?

524
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:40,578
We drove him crazy, he
 left over three months ago.

525
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:42,180
- Huh?

526
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,181
Listen, I don't know about this.

527
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,182
- Danny, come on, come on.

528
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,149
- I said I don't
know about this.

529
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,751
- Come on, man, just relax.

530
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:47,685
- Let's grab a burger, man.

531
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:48,419
- All right, you're buying.

532
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,588
(arguing)

533
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:52,423
Whoo!

534
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,498
I don't know how you do it, man.

535
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,966
- Do what?

536
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,268
- Keep Tamara and Melanie
  going at the same time

537
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,936
without either of
  them finding out.

538
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,237
- Yeah.
- Huh?

539
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:07,405
- It must be all
  in the wrist, huh?

540
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,706
- All in the wrist.

541
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:10,241
- Well you don't want
to get too bogged down,

542
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,277
otherwise we couldn't pick
  up any babes at the lake.

543
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,778
- That's right.

544
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,379
You never know who you're
  gonna meet at the lake.

545
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,313
- Yeah.

546
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,714
- What'll you have, fellas?

547
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:17,549
- Mr. Milner.

548
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,650
- What'll you have?

549
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,617
- Don't you remember me?

550
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:20,451
- What do you mean?

551
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:21,719
Yeah, I remember ya.

552
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:24,155
And it was all you guys
who messed with my car.

553
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,456
If I could have proved
 it I'd put you all

554
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,091
behind bars where you belong.

555
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:28,459
- You got the wrong
 guy, Mr. Milner.

556
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:29,761
I'd never mess with your car.

557
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,896
- But then you're all
 the same, aren't ya?

558
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:34,098
A bunch of spoiled kids who's
 only understanding of life

559
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:36,568
comes from watching
 music videos.

560
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,938
Hey, wait on these
  no-goods for me, will ya?

561
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,139
- But Mr. Milner.

562
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,975
- What's wrong
  with music videos?

563
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,778
(engine rumbling)

564
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,581
- [Doug] Take it easy, Daniel.

565
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,249
- All right, see ya.

566
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,785
- All right, we'll see
 you later, all right?

567
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,719
Don't be late, okay?

568
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,653
- [Randy] Say hi to your mother.

569
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:57,488
- You guys are so bad.

570
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,860
(birds twittering)

571
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:22,614
(engine rumbling)

572
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,421
- [Dan] Mom.

573
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,626
- Thanks for letting
 me use your car.

574
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,460
Here are your keys.

575
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,928
- Mom--

576
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,862
- Oh, there's some chicken
  for you in the fridge.

577
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,097
I'm having dinner with Wes.

578
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,598
- With Wes?

579
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,400
- Don't act surprised, I told
 you he'd asked me out again.

580
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,635
- Well where's Dad?

581
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,936
- In Los Angeles,
 where do you think?

582
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,537
- And what about Jenny?

583
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:47,472
- Who?

584
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,673
- Your daughter, my sister.

585
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,575
- Daniel, I'm in a
 hurry, see you later.

586
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,409
- Mom?

587
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:59,183
- Have fun tonight
  at your party.

588
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:02,086
(car door closing)

589
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:10,261
Bye.
  (engine rumbling)

590
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,134
- Nice car.
 - What?

591
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:19,170
- This can't be my car.

592
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,605
I could never afford
 a thing like this.

593
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,507
- You bet the football
 games pretty well last year.

594
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,075
- I've never gambled in my life.

595
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,877
- Your life is
 different now, Daniel.

596
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:26,911
- Hey, what's up with my Mom.

597
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,479
And where's my Dad, and Jenny?

598
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,648
- Your folks have been
 divorced for several years.

599
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,483
You see, it was your prayers
 that held your folks together

600
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,686
when they were going
through the tough times.

601
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,121
Since you weren't there to
 pray for them, they split up.

602
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:39,023
As for Jenny, she
  was never born.

603
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:40,958
- Look, I'm not believing
  any of this stuff.

604
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:43,594
- You had a big influence
  with Mr. Milner, too.

605
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:44,796
He really liked you.

606
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,698
Many days you were
 his only bright spot.

607
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,467
Then he got frustrated with
 the other students and left.

608
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,736
Too bad, because he was
  one of the best teachers.

609
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,205
- Look, I'm not buying any
  of this angel bit, okay?

610
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,007
But I kind of like the
  way some things are going.

611
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,308
I mean, for a change
 everybody doesn't just

612
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,710
see me as a nice guy.

613
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,912
I mean, I'm respected,
 I'm popular,

614
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,581
Tamara's crazy about
 me, and I like it.

615
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,316
- No, Daniel, you've
 got that all wrong.

616
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,617
(telephone ringing)

617
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:07,552
- Yeah?

618
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,687
Well, we'll see, excuse me.

619
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:13,624
(telephone ringing)

620
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,230
Hello?

621
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,832
- [Tamara] 7:00,
I'll be waiting.

622
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:21,666
- Tamara?

623
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,901
(dial tone ringing)

624
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:27,171
(telephone clattering)

625
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,210
(door closing)

626
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,478
Look, like I said before,

627
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,846
I'm not believing
  any of this stuff,

628
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,815
and I know that somebody's
  up to something.

629
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,592
(keys jangling)

630
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,161
(lively music)

631
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,165
(kids chatting)

632
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:04,735
- Danny.

633
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:05,770
- How long have you
 guys been partying?

634
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,371
- I don't know.

635
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:09,440
- What's up, guys?
  - Hey, Doug.

636
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,842
- What's going on, what
have you got, the silk?

637
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,310
Hey, where you been, man?

638
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,511
- Hey, the lady kept me waiting.

639
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,512
- I did not!

640
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:16,914
- Hey, let the
  festivities begin.

641
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:17,748
- All right.

642
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:19,016
- Party, sir?

643
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:20,785
No, sir, we're not
  having a party.

644
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,221
No, it's just the
stereo's a little loud.

645
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,589
- Hey, Randy, what's up, man.

646
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:28,092
- Hold on a second,
 let me turn it down.

647
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,662
(door opening and closing)

648
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,600
There, how's that?

649
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,601
- Hey.
 - Hey!

650
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:41,472
(kids talking and laughing)

651
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,080
- Hey, watch out!

652
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,315
(laughing)

653
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:57,088
(kids chatting)

654
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,726
- You got that right.

655
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:05,196
- Melanie.
  - Randy.

656
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,130
- Where's Bull?

657
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,300
- I broke up with that loser.

658
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,469
- Wait, remember the time when
 Danny boy stole the battery

659
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,070
out of Miss Stoke's car?

660
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,539
That was a classic.

661
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,573
- That'll teach her to
  give me a bad grade, huh?

662
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,575
(everyone laughing)

663
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,010
- Here, let me get
  you another, babe.

664
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,844
- Thanks.

665
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,914
- Danny.

666
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,516
(kids talking)

667
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:39,664
- Remember those
  girls at the lake?

668
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,598
We can call them--

669
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,667
- Hey, handsome.
- Melanie.

670
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,968
- I was waiting by
  my princess phone

671
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,937
for you to call and got anxious.

672
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:46,938
I knew you'd be here.

673
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,205
- I just dropped
in for a minute.

674
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:49,807
- Here you go, hon.

675
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,310
Melanie.
  - Tamara.

676
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:54,712
- Where's Bull?

677
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,347
- I broke up with him.

678
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,015
- Oh, I didn't know
 that, that's too bad.

679
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:00,551
- That's all right, Danny
knows, that's all that matters.

680
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,153
- (laughing) What's
 that supposed to mean?

681
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,522
- Come on, Tamara,
 you know you lost him.

682
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,856
- Why don't you go
  back to Bull, Mel.

683
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:07,625
That's about as good
 as you're gonna get.

684
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,527
- Listen, you better
 start to face the fact

685
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,095
that Danny's mine
  and you're out.

686
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,630
- Now just a minute--

687
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,531
- Listen, Mel, I don't want
 you to come near him again.

688
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,799
You got that?

689
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,666
- Well I can't stop
 doing that, Tamara,

690
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,401
because I'm pregnant.

691
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:19,603
- What?

692
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:20,538
- I'm pregnant
  with Danny's baby,

693
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,673
and we're going to be married.

694
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,275
- No, no, no.
 - You liar!

695
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,911
- You two-timer after
 everything we've been through.

696
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,145
- Tamara, wait!

697
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,248
Keep the party going, will ya?

698
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:32,984
Talk, talk, talk.

699
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,885
Melanie, what are
  you talking about?

700
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:36,854
You can't be pregnant,
 not with my kid.

701
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,089
- I'm not pregnant.

702
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,256
I just said that to get
Tamara off our case.

703
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:40,558
- You just announced
 to everybody

704
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,059
that you were
 pregnant with my kid.

705
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,561
- I don't care.

706
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,262
I'd do anything to keep
 you, Danny, I told you that.

707
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:46,464
- I can't believe you
 just told everybody

708
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,432
that you were pregnant!

709
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:50,368
- You don't want me after
  all you promised me?

710
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,536
- I haven't promised
 you anything.

711
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:53,738
- What?

712
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,007
- I said I haven't
 promised you anything.

713
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,074
- I hate you.

714
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:01,245
- Danny, Danny,
 they're not worth it.

715
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,646
But did you really
  get her pregnant?

716
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:03,681
- What?
  - Then it's not worth it.

717
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,615
- Tamara!

718
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,183
- They're not worth it, Danny.

719
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:07,018
Hey.

720
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,689
Weren't you on the cover
of Glamour magazine?

721
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:15,259
(door opening and closing)

722
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:22,133
- Tamara?

723
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,567
- Leave me alone.

724
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,138
- Look, Melanie's not pregnant.

725
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,406
She just made that up.

726
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,907
- I can't believe you
 were two-timing me

727
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,142
right behind my back.

728
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,376
- I wasn't.

729
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:33,911
- I'll never be able
 to live this down.

730
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,547
Everybody's probably in there
 saying how stupid Tamara is.

731
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,682
- Melanie was lying, I've
  never been out with her.

732
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:41,118
- I mean, you were two-timing
 me right under my nose.

733
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:42,920
- Tamara, it's a lie, I've
  never been out with her.

734
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,855
Listen, you're the only
one that I care about.

735
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:48,059
- The only person you care
about, Dan Burgess, is yourself.

736
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,260
- Tamara, listen to me, we--

737
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,761
- I am not gonna
 let you run me over.

738
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,229
- Tamara, please--

739
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:53,397
- I don't care if you
  are the man to be around,

740
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:55,232
the one to know, I
don't care who you are.

741
00:33:55,232 --> 00:33:56,701
- Is that the only reason
  why you went out with me?

742
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,536
- Oh, Dan Burgess, always
  the guy to be around.

743
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,805
- I said, is that the only
reason why you went out with me?

744
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,872
- Well I sure didn't
 go out with you

745
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:04,041
because you're a nice guy.

746
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,115
(door opening and closing)

747
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,719
- Yeah, I know.

748
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:18,789
- But, Bull, Danny's
 the one who told me

749
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,125
that you were
 seeing other girls.

750
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,127
Now I see he was just wanting
 me and you to break up

751
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,463
so he could use me.

752
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,033
(door opening and closing)

753
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,070
- Don't worry about it, buddy.

754
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,206
Women are like buses, one
 comes along every 10 minutes.

755
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,440
- How did I get into this mess?

756
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,275
- Oh, come on, dump
these losers, all right?

757
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:40,344
Remember those chicks want to
 meet us at the lake tomorrow.

758
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,812
- I gotta pray.
- What?

759
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:43,247
- I said I gotta pray.

760
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,715
- (laughing) Yeah, I
  guess I'd be praying, too,

761
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,117
if I knew I had a little papoose
to support in a few months.

762
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,285
- Melanie's not pregnant,
  she made that up.

763
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:49,820
- Look, great, then
your troubles are over.

764
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,288
- Burgess, you got
nothing to worry about.

765
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:52,456
- Well what am I supposed
  to do about the girls?

766
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:53,691
- Dump them, I told you.

767
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,859
Look, the chicks at the lake

768
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,127
make them look
 like sixth graders.

769
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,528
- I'm not used to being
in situations like this.

770
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,263
- Oh, come on, stop worrying
 about it, all right?

771
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,397
Let's have a brew.

772
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:01,899
- Let's stop
 talking about women.

773
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,400
- Yeah, like Randy said,
  they're like buses, okay?

774
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,670
And hey, at least buses
  are sometimes dependable.

775
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,405
Listen, if there's one thing
 I've learned about chicks,

776
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:09,774
you can't trust them.

777
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,041
I mean, you can't take
 them too seriously.

778
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,476
- Say, Dan needs a brew, man.

779
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:13,978
Why don't you get
 him brew, all right?

780
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,813
- One chick I might be taking
 more seriously if I were you

781
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,047
is that Sheila chick.

782
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:18,315
- Oh, Sheila.

783
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:19,884
- God, she is so fine,
 and she digs you, too.

784
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,418
She totally digs you.

785
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:22,920
She's crazy about you.

786
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,755
- [Randy] Did you see the
 way she was looking at him.

787
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,023
- Guys, I was supposed
 to meet Scotty Parks

788
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:30,027
after school today,
 I'll be right back.

789
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,729
- Scotty Parks?

790
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,631
(engine rumbling)

791
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,568
(car doors opening and closing)

792
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,469
- Let's go.

793
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,308
- Hey, Lucy.
 - Hey, Dan.

794
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,876
- Um, listen, tell
 your brother I'm sorry

795
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:47,044
I missed our appointment today.

796
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,879
I forgot all about it.

797
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,283
Hey, what'd I say?

798
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:54,785
- You're a real scum.

799
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:55,719
- [Dan] Why, what did I do?

800
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,954
- That was Scott's sister.

801
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:57,888
- Yeah, I know, I was
supposed to meet Scotty

802
00:35:57,888 --> 00:35:59,123
after school today.

803
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,858
- You're on drugs, this
is a pretty low joke.

804
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,059
- What's going on here?

805
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,627
- You know where
 Scotty is, you jerk.

806
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:04,962
- What's the idea of
 calling me a jerk?

807
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:05,963
Listen, what's going on?

808
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:06,897
Where is he?

809
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:08,365
- In his grave.

810
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:10,000
You know he committed
  suicide three months ago.

811
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,969
Why are you doing this?

812
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,839
(dramatic music)

813
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,673
- Suicide?

814
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,009
- Hey, Dan, how
  are we doing, man?

815
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:22,379
(dramatic music)

816
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,549
(door opening and closing)

817
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:26,750
- Beggars can't be choosers.

818
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,918
- Wait, wait a
  minute, were you--

819
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:30,454
- Guys, guys, listen,
 where's Scotty?

820
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,889
Where's Scotty, Scotty Parks?

821
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,123
- What are you talking about?
 - Where is he at?

822
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:33,958
- Burgess!

823
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,462
- Bull, no.
 - Say your prayers.

824
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,563
- Come on.
 - No, Bull, no, no!

825
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:42,199
- Go on, get out of here.

826
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,902
(dramatic music)

827
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,506
- You guys go that way,
I'll get out front.

828
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:52,276
(dramatic music)

829
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:03,287
(thudding)

830
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,824
- Oh, come on, get
  out of the way.

831
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,693
- Keep following,
  we'll cut him off.

832
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:11,762
(car doors opening and closing)

833
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,498
(engine revving)

834
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,835
(kids yelling)

835
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:18,936
- Run, Danny!

836
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,706
(dramatic music)

837
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,896
(brakes screeching)

838
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,901
- Come on, open up, open up!

839
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,603
Help me out, Muriel, Muriel!

840
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,838
No, don't kill me, don't
kill me, Bull, please.

841
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:56,040
I didn't touch her,
 I didn't touch her.

842
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,341
Bull, please, I didn't
 get her pregnant.

843
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,575
Please don't touch me.

844
00:37:58,575 --> 00:37:59,376
- Burgess, what are
 you talking about?

845
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:00,644
Will you calm down.

846
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:01,712
- [Dan] Don't kill
  me, don't kill me.

847
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,247
- Calm down.

848
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,348
I was driving by and see you
 banging on the church door.

849
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,282
Have you gone nuts?

850
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,284
What's your problem?

851
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,920
(chiming)

852
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,089
(panting)

853
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,037
You're acting pretty crazy here.

854
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:29,006
- Uh, I'm okay, I'm okay, Bull.

855
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,075
- Listen, Burgess, don't
you start losing it.

856
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,910
You're the only guy who's
 got it together around here.

857
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,145
- I won't, I won't, I promise.

858
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:36,313
- You need a lift?

859
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,550
- Uh, no, my, my
 car's around the back.

860
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,652
- [Bull] Okay, see you, Burgess.

861
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,220
- I'll see you, Bull.

862
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,689
- Hey, I still want to
talk with you sometime.

863
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,024
- Sure, anytime.

864
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,930
- I'll call ya.

865
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,466
- Okay, see you.

866
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,306
(car door opening and closing)

867
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,042
(engine revving)

868
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,919
- Still wish you
 were a non-believer?

869
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:18,756
- Muriel, you
 really are an angel.

870
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,226
Hey, what about Scotty Parks?

871
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,627
He's okay, isn't he?

872
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,230
And my mom and dad are together,
and Jenny's still alive?

873
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,500
- Yes, Daniel, everything is
 now back to the way it was.

874
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,034
- (sighing) That's a relief.

875
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:33,704
I mean, I, I, I thought it
 was one big joke, you know?

876
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,973
- That was a very unwise
  request you made, Daniel,

877
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,008
wishing you were a non-believer.

878
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,911
The Heavenly Father answered
 your prayer last night,

879
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,112
and gave you one day to show you

880
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:44,481
how your life would
 be without him.

881
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:46,183
- Yeah, I know, it was stupid.

882
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,151
- I'm well aware of the struggle

883
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,786
you're going through, Daniel.

884
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,555
Satan is trying to lure
 you, to get you off course.

885
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,190
You think that Doug
 and his friends

886
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,826
are having all the fun,
and you're missing out.

887
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,127
But your dad is right
 when he tells you

888
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:59,730
that all you're
 missing out on is sin.

889
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,666
Sin is fun for a season,
but sin injures people,

890
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,902
hurts you and grieves the Lord.

891
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,738
Would you have wanted your son
 to go to that party tonight?

892
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,639
- Well, no.

893
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,773
- Then why would you go?

894
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:11,942
We must lead by example.

895
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,310
- Yeah, I know.

896
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,746
- I know you have an
 attraction for Tamara, Daniel,

897
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,449
but the Lord holds
  relationships most sacred.

898
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,852
And it grieves Him when His
children take them so liberally.

899
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,153
The purpose of a relationship

900
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,489
is to find a lifelong
 companion, Daniel.

901
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,723
Someone to marry.

902
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:29,359
Let me ask you, are you
ready to be married?

903
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,628
- Well not yet, I mean, I
 want to go to college first,

904
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:32,963
you know, and maybe
 get a job, and--

905
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,932
- Then you're not ready
for the relationship.

906
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,134
The truth is, is that you'd
 like to spend some time

907
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,702
with Tamara because you desire

908
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,938
some physical pleasure from her.

909
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,940
- Man, it's like you're
seeing right through me.

910
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,708
- The Lord does, Daniel.

911
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,511
Let me ask you, if a
  girl you'd like to marry,

912
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,880
how many other men would you
 like her to be intimate with

913
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,449
before you marry her?

914
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,383
- Well, no one.

915
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,018
- Then go and do likewise.

916
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,753
Wouldn't it be great,
  Daniel, to spend your life

917
00:40:56,753 --> 00:41:00,190
with a person who was
  untouched by anyone else.

918
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,458
- Yeah, that'd be great.

919
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,660
- This is what the
  Lord has intended.

920
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,863
You see, the Lord's not trying
 to restrict your pleasure,

921
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,332
Daniel, but rather He's
trying to maximize it.

922
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,834
There's nothing wrong with
  building relationships,

923
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:14,138
just save all the physical
  intimacy for your wife.

924
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,875
The Lord's ways will bring
  you full joy, Daniel.

925
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,343
- I understand.

926
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,546
- The Lord knows your
  desires and what you need.

927
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,516
Wait on Him, He'll take care
 of you when you're ready.

928
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,552
Instead, continue reaching
  out to people for Jesus.

929
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,387
This is what's most important.

930
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,122
- But I want to reach
 people for the Lord,

931
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:35,058
I really do, Muriel, but I'm
not affecting anyone for Jesus.

932
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:37,461
They just see me as this
nice guy, that's all.

933
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,564
- Daniel, Daniel, but
  you are affecting people.

934
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,065
Take a second glance.

935
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:43,800
Look at all the athletes
you're influencing

936
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,469
through the FCA program.

937
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,204
The Lord is really using that.

938
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,672
And Ricky and your
  Christian friends,

939
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,240
they really look up to you.

940
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,109
And people like Bull need you.

941
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,711
He's never heard the good
  news about salvation.

942
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:57,281
You'll be his first
 chance next week.

943
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,050
And even Mr. Milner knows you
 have something he doesn't.

944
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,285
He's really watching you.

945
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,819
I already told you
  how your prayers

946
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:04,688
kept your parents together.

947
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,056
And Scotty Parks?

948
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,324
Well if it wasn't for you,

949
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,860
I think you know where
 he might be right now.

950
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,329
Oh, and even Doug is
being influenced by you.

951
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,530
- Doug?

952
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,632
All he does is mock
 us and the Lord.

953
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:17,734
- On the outside and
 to keep his image.

954
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:19,570
But you didn't know that
  Doug was reading his Bible

955
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,071
every night in his room.

956
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,839
He's starting to
 search for answers,

957
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,808
and it's because of you, Daniel.

958
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,742
- I don't believe it.

959
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:27,210
I would have never known.

960
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,880
- You have no idea how the
 Lord wants to use you, Daniel.

961
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,282
The only way He can is
 when you're living for Him.

962
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:34,952
You can trust the Lord, Daniel.

963
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,688
- I know I can, and I
want Him to use me, too.

964
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,891
- The only person that will
 stop you will be yourself.

965
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,125
- I know.

966
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,760
- Time is short, Daniel.

967
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,195
Jesus is coming back soon.

968
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,097
Continue reaching out to people.

969
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,398
The lake of fire is real,

970
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,634
and many people you
know are heading there.

971
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,003
In your school,
 even in your church.

972
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,504
And very few truly have

973
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:57,474
that personal relationship
  with the Lord, Daniel,

974
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,277
and the laborers are even fewer.

975
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,778
- This has been quite a day.

976
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:03,814
- Oh, and you're not
 suspended from school, either.

977
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,949
Mr. Milner figured
  out what happened.

978
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:09,186
There's a message waiting
  for you when you get home.

979
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,520
- Thanks, Muriel.

980
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,189
Thanks for showing me the truth.

981
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,458
- Goodbye, Daniel.

982
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,292
- Goodbye.

983
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,133
Oh, Muriel, will
I see you again?

984
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:26,903
(uplifting music)

985
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:35,212
(birds twittering)

986
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,550
(playful music)

987
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,973
(alarm blaring)
(gasping)

988
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:42,245
Jenny!

989
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:44,514
Jenny?

990
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,086
Mom, you look great,
 good to see you.

991
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,021
Dad, how's it going,
 how's the job going?

992
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,355
Jenny.
 (smooching)

993
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:54,491
- Ew, gross, ew.

994
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,227
(peaceful music)

995
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,632
Hey, Mrs. Moore.
- Hi, Dan.

996
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:04,034
- Great day, huh?

997
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,205
(peaceful music)

998
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,514
All right, listen, we've
gotta get as many people

999
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,949
as we can to the film today.

1000
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,317
I really think the Lord's
  gonna do something.

1001
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:21,151
- What's gotten into you, man?

1002
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,419
You seem all pumped up.

1003
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,687
Things must be going
 better with Tamara.

1004
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,956
- Nah, things are
  better with Jesus.

1005
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,462
- [Tamara] Hey, Dan, sorry
  I came at you yesterday

1006
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:34,164
in Milner's class, I
found out what happened.

1007
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,332
- Oh, that's okay, Tamara.

1008
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,533
I haven't thought
another thing about it.

1009
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,801
- Missed you at Randy's
party last night.

1010
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,369
We had a lot of fun.

1011
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,037
- Nah, not my kind of fun.

1012
00:45:41,037 --> 00:45:43,406
- Hey, Burgess, missed
  Randy's party last night.

1013
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:44,674
It was a great time.

1014
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:45,876
- Oh, it's a good thing
you didn't come, though.

1015
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,344
We partied way
  past your bedtime.

1016
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,079
- Hey, you guys, come
 to FCA this afternoon.

1017
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,480
We're showing a
  really good film.

1018
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,616
- Oh, no, we stopped
 watching cartoons long ago.

1019
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:53,850
- Come on, I really
 want you to come.

1020
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,152
- We don't have time
 for your stupid films.

1021
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,419
- I guarantee you'll like it.

1022
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:57,821
- Look, I said we don't
watch cartoons anymore.

1023
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:58,789
I'm out of here.

1024
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,023
Come on, man.

1025
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,525
- [Dan] Hey, Doug, it'll
really make you think.

1026
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,392
- Burgess, I got better
  things to do with my time.

1027
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,627
- Come on, Doug, look,

1028
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,128
I know we don't see eye
to eye on everything,

1029
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:07,297
but just do me this
 one favor one time.

1030
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:10,100
Come on, give the film a chance.

1031
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,602
- Man, I said I
 ain't got the time.

1032
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:13,937
- Make the time.

1033
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,075
It's got the answers, man.

1034
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:21,812
(dramatic music)

1035
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:25,215
- Okay.

1036
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,587
All right, but if I don't like
 it, I'm walking right out.

1037
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,322
- All right.

1038
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:36,059
I'll have a free ticket
for you at the door.

1039
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,694
3:30.

1040
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,430
(peaceful music)

1041
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,078
Hi, Vicky.
  - Hi, Dan.

1042
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,213
- How's it going?

1043
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,447
- It's going okay.

1044
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:58,381
- Boy, the Lord's
 really been showing me

1045
00:46:58,381 --> 00:46:59,883
some good stuff lately.

1046
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,117
- Oh, yeah?
 - Yeah.

1047
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:04,888
- I'd like to tell
 you about it sometime.

1048
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,723
- I think I'd like to hear it.

1049
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:09,726
- Can I call you?
  - Yeah, okay.

1050
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,228
- See ya.
  - See ya.

1051
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,264
- Yes.

1052
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:18,034
(peaceful music)

1053
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,941
- Scotty.

1054
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:26,209
Scotty, Scotty.

1055
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,446
Scotty, Scotty, you're
okay, you're okay, man.

1056
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,814
It is good to see you.

1057
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,048
- We're still meeting
 today, aren't we?

1058
00:47:32,048 --> 00:47:33,283
- Absolutely, I
  wouldn't miss it.

1059
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,551
- I've got a ton of
 questions for you.

1060
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,319
- The Bible's got
  the answers, man.

1061
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,822
All right, I'll see you later.

1062
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:40,891
Hey, Scotty?

1063
00:47:42,225 --> 00:47:43,126
Jesus, man.

1064
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,565
(uplifting music)
