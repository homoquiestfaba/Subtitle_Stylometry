1
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,684
C'mon boys we ain't got all day.

2
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,199
Hey baby doll!

3
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,574
Baby doll!

4
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,231
Now what's next?

5
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:38,865
Sweet Carl's.

6
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Ten dollars.

7
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,835
Ten bucks?

8
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,705
Loan delinquent, two weeks.

9
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,739
Break... fingers.

10
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,730
This has gotta be a mistake!

11
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,073
Maybe a couple of zeros
missing or something.

12
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,684
I mean break fingers!
For ten bucks?

13
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,499
I don't see what you're
so upset about, George

14
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,001
I mean it ain't like we
get to keep the money.

15
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,037
So, what's the difference if
it's ten dollars or million?

16
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,661
The idea is to work ourselves
up into the organization not down.

17
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,702
How we gonna it by
collecting milk money?

18
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,303
I guess...

19
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,373
What's next?

20
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,764
Pickup Mr. Aorta's
underwear at the cleaner's.

21
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,017
What the fuck!

22
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,221
Just kidding, George.

23
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,866
Hey! George...

24
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,237
What can I do you for?

25
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,850
A manicure... what can you do
me for? You know what we want.

26
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,319
No... not really.

27
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,887
Let me refresh your memory.

28
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,871
On October 14th you borrowed
money from Mr. Aorta.

29
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,348
I did?

30
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,363
No, he did. Yea, you did!

31
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,955
Mmm, October 14th...
October... 14th.

32
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,624
The date rings a bell... Oh yea!

33
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,894
Yea, I, my old ladies birthday.

34
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,569
I borrowed ten bucks
to take her out to dinner.

35
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:18,765
Hold on.

36
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,267
Ok...

37
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:22,369
Here. Here's four

38
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,817
I'll get you the rest on Friday.

39
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,743
No, you're past overdue.

40
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,545
Break his fingers.

41
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,926
Hey... hey!

42
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,862
You're gonna break my
fingers for a ten dollar loan?

43
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,797
You gotta be kidding...

44
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,267
What do I look like a
"Borges belle comedian?"

45
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,971
Wait! George! I've...
taken you fishing!

46
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,295
I gave you lobsters!

47
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,108
It was a very good
lobster, George.

48
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,932
Yea! I can't mend nets
with busted fingers.

49
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,583
You bust 'em my
family don't eat.

50
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,307
For God sake, it was
only ten bucks!

51
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,546
Alright, alright.

52
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:08,948
Aww, thanks!

53
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:11,385
You're a true friend.

54
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,922
Ow! God, you broke
my fucking nose!

55
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,535
George...

56
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Well now he can fix his nets!

57
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,366
George! Dip!

58
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,335
Hi, Ruffo.

59
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,638
DeMarco, he's dead.

60
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,012
What you talking about?

61
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,168
He died about an hour ago.
In some kind of accident.

62
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,449
Poor DeMarco.

63
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,530
Why you smiling?

64
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,554
Why am I smiling?

65
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,638
Because I just got my acceptance
letter to medical school.

66
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Dip...

67
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,061
DeMarco's dead.

68
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,030
I know he's dead.

69
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,746
I just don't know why
that would make you smile.

70
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,890
First, he was an asshole,
so he should rot in hell.

71
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,609
Second, he was conciliary
to Aorta for you non Italians.

72
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,813
He's number two on
the totem pole.

73
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,214
So...

74
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:17,917
Don't you get it?

75
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,052
It's my turn at bat!

76
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,088
My turn to move up.

77
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,465
What's so funny?

78
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,569
"Concigliary" Gianfranco...

79
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:40,407
Yea...

80
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,675
Come on George...

81
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,071
Think of all the
guys ahead of you.

82
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,781
Glasso, Madariaga, Revell...

83
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,298
Well those guys
are pieces of shit.

84
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,787
And I'd stop laughing if I were you,
McKenzie, before I bust your Irish ass!

85
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,492
I'm better than those jerks.

86
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,593
I deserve the job.

87
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,062
I know that George.

88
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,566
No disagreement here.

89
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,116
Well then let's go celebrate.

90
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,577
Beat it beefcake!

91
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,183
Ay, look.

92
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,846
It's my cheapest,
rudest, customer.

93
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,656
Ah gee, Carol, why do you
always have to be so vague?

94
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:31,758
Get off it, Jorge.

95
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,540
You're the only jerk I know who
tries to pay me in installments.

96
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,124
Like I'm a toaster
oven from Hershman's.

97
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,547
You know we love to chat
with you but Dip and I...

98
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,003
We don't come here
for conversation.

99
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,279
Sorry, Jorge, I don't accept
your checks no more.

100
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,243
I got cold cash!

101
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,214
Ok.

102
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,284
But I go with, Dip.

103
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,100
You can have my beautiful
new partner, Glorice.

104
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,625
Just arrived on the dock.

105
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,626
C'mon, Dip.

106
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:08,194
No, no, no.

107
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,284
I ain't getting stuck with your
so-called beauties anymore.

108
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,846
What are you talking about?

109
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,310
Does the name Henrietta Harry
Hopkins mean anything to you?

110
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,651
Or Teresa Two-Ton Tompkins?

111
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,675
Relax, Jorge.

112
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,364
This Glorice, she's
a looker Papi.

113
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:28,882
No... I ain't buying.

114
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,187
Dip my boy... your turn
to fall on the grenade.

115
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,656
Glorice!

116
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:38,726
We got customers.

117
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,215
I'd like to introduce
you to Dip.

118
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,339
Hi.

119
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:58,679
Dip's with chicka.

120
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
My name's George.

121
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,466
George.

122
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,579
What baby?

123
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,704
We can't. We can't.

124
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:29,334
Well there are certain female
functions which occur once a month.

125
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,827
I coulda had Chicka,
why didn't you tell me?

126
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,796
I don't believe it.

127
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,580
For one I thought I
thought you were cute.

128
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,622
Cute!

129
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:44,925
A bunny rabbit's cute.

130
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:47,895
George Giafranco...

131
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,062
Is good looking.

132
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,939
And two, I thought I could
please you in other ways.

133
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,135
Like what?

134
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,301
I'm sure you all know
why I called this meeting.

135
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:04,671
Earlier today

136
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,643
an accident down at the docks
involving a crate filled with tuna fish

137
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,613
resulted in the death
of Richie DeMarco.

138
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,350
Conciliary DeMarco
was a brutal man,

139
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,654
who killed without conscience.

140
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,742
A man who never once felt
sympathy for those he terrorized.

141
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,505
In fact... he was
never happy unless

142
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,329
another human being
somewhere in this world

143
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,165
was suffering.

144
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,535
It was because of these
endearing qualities

145
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,325
that conciliary DeMarco
will be missed by us all.

146
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,144
A moment of silence, please.

147
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,460
Ok, now on to some
weekly business matters.

148
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,318
Happy birthday Mr. Aorta!

149
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,567
For he's a jolly good fellow,

150
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:03,731
for he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow

151
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,900
which no body can deny.

152
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,137
Count 'em boys
they're all there.

153
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,266
For once I wish you boys
would have shortchanged me.

154
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,294
Oh course we've got
some presents for ya.

155
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,531
Ah guys, you shouldn't have,

156
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,334
but since you already bought
them I might as well open them.

157
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,502
Why didn't you tell
me it was his birthday?

158
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,128
I'm sorry George,
I completely forgot.

159
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,765
It's a .45 silver plated.

160
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:39,766
Custom made.

161
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,567
Nice...

162
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,081
Very nice.

163
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,516
You two don't have a present?

164
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,460
Is that something you
deduced all by yourself?

165
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,846
Good luck getting
the new position.

166
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,224
Personalized brass
knuckles, Boss.

167
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:02,431
I had your name
inscribed backwards,

168
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,455
so you could leave your
name on your victim's face.

169
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:07,928
Very thoughtful, Ruffo.

170
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,386
Well Boss since
you're a special guy.

171
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,039
Dip and I got you a special
gift, very special.

172
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,411
And uh, it's not here
now but uh it's a date.

173
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,307
I think you're gonna like it.

174
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,482
Trust me.

175
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,896
What's her name?

176
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,187
It's uh... Glorice.

177
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,263
Good day ladies!

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,237
Listen cheapskate, nobody shortchanges
my friend after she wets his wick.

179
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,794
What the hell are you talking
about? >> It's ok Chicka, let him go.

180
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,081
The money you paid me
was counterfeit, George.

181
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,020
It was? Really?
Awe, I'm sorry I didn't know.

182
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,289
Here.

183
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,421
Hey, hey, I got it at the bank
this morning, it's good.

184
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:17,865
I sweat to God.

185
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,107
Something gives me the
feeling you're not just here to chat.

186
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:24,937
Glorice... uh...

187
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,155
We was wondering if you could
perform your oral specialty.

188
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,555
On which one of you?

189
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,490
No, no, it's not for us.
It's for our boss, Mr. Aorta.

190
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,514
It's his birthday.

191
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,556
That's Joey "The Heart"
Aorta! The mob boss?

192
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,053
He runs this town... forget it
Glorice! The man's a murderer.

193
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,684
Let me get this straight,
you want a blowjob certificate?

194
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,763
Yea.

195
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,280
$50 dollars up front
and no funny money.

196
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,438
$50 bucks for a lousy hummer?

197
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:00,907
Too much!

198
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,021
It's high... but if you
went to the trouble

199
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,525
of finding me you
must really need me.

200
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,647
$30.

201
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,819
Alright, $50,

202
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,589
but you better be sucking
harder than Dorothy's tornado.

203
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,338
Where the hell is this broad of
yours? >> Oh she'll be here soon.

204
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,070
Boss... you're gonna love her.

205
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,683
Gianfranco,
how could I possibly love her

206
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,943
when I've never even seen her?

207
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:37,776
I just know.

208
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,482
Georgie, things going good?

209
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,828
Things going good?

210
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,064
Glorice ain't here and Aorta's
holding me responsible,

211
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,322
things couldn't be worse!

212
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,591
Hey! Hey!

213
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:53,993
Chow mein!

214
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,029
What are you doing!

215
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,717
Believe it or not wop
asshole, it's called cooking.

216
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,448
No, no, no, this is a Sicilian
restaurant we don't want fried rat.

217
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,504
Hey let go!

218
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,783
I'm the cook. >> Says who?

219
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:08,807
Says Mr. Lucizzi.

220
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,256
Mr. Lucizzi hired me
because I'm a good cook.

221
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,982
I work hard for the money.
Sicilian food...

222
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,732
So you leave me alone.
Don't call me names.

223
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,815
I'm gonna make your boss the
best Sicilian food he ever had.

224
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,540
Alright, that must be her.
I guess we're stuck with you

225
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,476
well make it good.
And no sweet and sour spaghetti.

226
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Please!

227
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,303
You real funny man!

228
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,118
Yea... I'm a fucking
joke a minute.

229
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,018
Glorice is here.

230
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,019
You're late!

231
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,361
Um... she had a problem
with the taxi, Boss.

232
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,071
Gianfranco, let the broad
make up her own damn excuses.

233
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,054
First of all I'm a
woman not a broad.

234
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,111
And second I would
hardly call 45 extra

235
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,895
minutes for a woman to
make an arrival, late.

236
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,662
How's things going
out there, George?

237
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,764
Terrible, they haven't said
a kind word to each other.

238
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:29,788
Food's ready.

239
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,191
This better be good. Or I'm
gonna kill your entire family.

240
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,329
I have feeling you
very unhappy child.

241
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:10,796
The cook...

242
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,538
Yea? >> What part
of Sicily is he from?

243
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,636
The East. The far east.

244
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,172
I could tell.

245
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,341
The man has talent.

246
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,677
We'll let him know Mr. Aorta.

247
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,900
Hey you.
Give me some of that bread.

248
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,190
The name's Glorice,
not "Hey you."

249
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:34,953
Gianfranco...

250
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,463
The wine, the food, the
place, first rate.

251
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,195
But the broad...

252
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,701
You know Mr. Aorta,

253
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,970
I know who you are and what you
do but I'm not afraid of you.

254
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,143
Do not call me a broad!

255
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,744
I'm the man here!

256
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:00,846
I make the rules.

257
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,815
And I'll call you anything I
want. Broad!

258
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,855
And I wanna talk to you...
and to you!

259
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,084
You're the first
woman to stand up to me.

260
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Me... I like that.

261
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,636
Incredible.

262
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,885
I almost couldn't believe
it neither, George.

263
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,028
I think he really likes her.

264
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,987
Ben, you mick bastard...
two more.

265
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,083
Hey.

266
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,187
Two more it'll be.

267
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,464
Thank you, Ben.

268
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,236
Oh, Georgie...

269
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,184
There a problem?

270
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,608
George Gianfranco
with a problem?

271
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,677
You are looking at the man who set
up the boss with a number one broad.

272
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:09,948
Glorice.

273
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,617
Cheers.

274
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,256
Conciliary...

275
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,891
Conciliary.

276
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:21,827
Conciliary...

277
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,716
The first thing... the first
thing I'm gonna do is.

278
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,243
I'm gonna buy some
new "minolian."

279
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,677
And then I'm gonna get...
George, look who.

280
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,449
It's the bosses girlfriend.

281
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,325
Why don't we invite
her to join us for a drink.

282
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,900
Is it really such a big deal?

283
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,991
What are you talking about?

284
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,329
Why don't we just
tell Mr. Aorta?

285
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,597
I know he seems tough.

286
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,799
But I think deep down he's
an understanding kind of guy.

287
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,437
You're kidding.

288
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,453
Maybe honesty is the
best policy here George.

289
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,579
Mr. Aorta...

290
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,615
We cannot tell a lie...

291
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,912
We accidentally set you up with a
man dressed in women's clothes.

292
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,355
You know, a he-she.

293
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:31,823
No problem!

294
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,337
Forget about it...

295
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,462
Yea sure. Why not?

296
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,045
I mean the guy's got
a sense of humor.

297
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,681
It'll all end up
as a great joke.

298
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,605
Something we can
all laugh about.

299
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:53,712
I can't believe it.

300
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:56,948
I have found the missing link.

301
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,286
What?

302
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,390
What are you saying?

303
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,492
What am I saying?

304
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,627
You are the missing link.

305
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:13,241
I mean no primate can talk,
no human being can be so naive.

306
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,145
You wanna hear about
Mr. Aorta's sense of humor?

307
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,815
He's giving us some
shoes two sizes too

308
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,439
big to see which one
of us sinks fastest.

309
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:25,578
That ain't so funny.

310
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:41,627
Just a second.

311
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,130
George, Dip, come on in.

312
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,321
Um... we wanna talk to
you Glorice about Mr. Aorta.

313
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,883
Right, in fact I'd like to
thank you boys for

314
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,953
introducing me to
your generous friend.

315
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,537
Actually we don't think you
should be going out with him again.

316
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,684
I'll uh... just let
me put it this way...

317
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,918
We don't think you're uh
woman enough for him.

318
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,129
I was woman enough
for you wasn't I, George?

319
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,728
You ain't gonna
get your $50 bucks.

320
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:17,830
What $50 bucks?

321
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:21,577
You know the 50 bucks we was

322
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,045
gonna give you for
going out with him again.

323
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,069
What's so funny?

324
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,998
Look Dip, Joey sent it
over to me this morning.

325
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,578
Must be worth over 1000 bucks.

326
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,807
I'm gonna milk your mob
boss for everything he's worth.

327
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:42,488
Bye boys.

328
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,572
When Ipsum wrote an
"Enemy of the People" he

329
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,808
intended for Doctor Stockman...
you

330
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,768
to represent individualism
and virility.

331
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,507
Uh excuse me Mr. Kirk but
ain't this Doctor Stockman a man?

332
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,274
My dear...

333
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,938
In Shakespearean times the
female roles were played by men

334
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,722
eliminating the jobs of
thousands of actresses.

335
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:15,698
Well I'm trying to right
a wrong by giving

336
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,562
you actresses the
chance to play all the roles!

337
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,791
Understand? >> I guess.

338
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,907
Well now, try it
again but with feeling.

339
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,765
The strongest man in the
world is he who stands most alone.

340
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,539
Good enough.

341
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,909
Now give those customers a show!

342
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,948
Well now come on then gentleman,
make yourself at home.

343
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,424
Sit down there.

344
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,563
Little nectar...

345
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,130
For the soul.

346
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,367
There we go!

347
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:05,837
Cheers!

348
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,339
Cheers. >> Cheers.

349
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,250
We got a problem.

350
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,852
Ah, Gregory Kirk,
problem solver.

351
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:27,111
We set our boss up with some
broad we don't think she's right.

352
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,860
I take it your boss is
a man of some power?

353
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,374
Yea. >> Yea.

354
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,038
You see we don't know
so many women but

355
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:39,147
seeing as how you run this strip
joint we thought maybe you could...

356
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:42,250
My dear boy Theatrum
Amitorius is a reperatory theater which

357
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,611
does erotic adaptions of the
classics... Not a strip joint!

358
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:48,891
Yea but that woman was naked.

359
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,475
Dip sees tits and
he thinks stripper.

360
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,284
You need to use your reasoning
and intellect not your base instincts.

361
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,329
Don't worry there's
hope for you yet.

362
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,840
We wanna set up our
boss with some actresses.

363
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,505
We have talented thespians
from a variety of backgrounds...

364
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,310
You wouldn't imagine the competition
necessary to become a classical actress.

365
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,676
Tremendous competition.

366
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,988
Yea it must be rough.

367
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,224
Excuse me Mr. Kirk?
Yes, Captain Horster?

368
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,248
What's a fuhjord?

369
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,150
Oh...

370
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:27,654
That's a fjord my dear.

371
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,321
What ever.

372
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,230
But I like Glorice.

373
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,180
If you like Glorice you're
gonna love these women.

374
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,413
And they're beautiful.
Right, Dip?

375
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,949
Not interested.

376
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,675
One's got legs... to there.

377
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
I don't think so.

378
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,269
Boss, these women are nice,
some of them they even tell jokes.

379
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,040
A man and a duck
they walk into...

380
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,992
And one's got the
perfect shaped jugs...

381
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,728
They defy gravity...

382
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,002
And a rear end like a
piece of ripe fruit.

383
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,673
And Dip, Dip! What's the
name of the one who

384
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,204
vacuums in the nude?

385
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:22,487
Then again, Glorice and I
ain't exactly married, right?

386
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,324
Well you two just wasted
about two hours of my time.

387
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,567
Now if you'll excuse me
I've got a date with Glorice.

388
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,162
Boss...

389
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,067
What was wrong with them?

390
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,534
I can't say exactly,

391
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,591
but Glorice has got something
these other women don't.

392
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,545
I got it... balls.

393
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,083
Glorice got balls.

394
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,036
Here you go boys, bon apetite.

395
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:00,338
Thank you, Maria.

396
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,053
What are you doing?

397
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,144
I'm trying to figure out a
solution to our problem.

398
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,228
No, no I mean right now.

399
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,951
I'm drinking a chocolate
milkshake so fucking what!

400
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,375
Maybe we should say you're
trying to drink a chocolate milkshake?

401
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,604
Cause you ain't able to.

402
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,608
Look, George.

403
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:42,224
I know this may not be the right
time to bring this up but I

404
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:44,248
gotta idea that could make
us a million bucks easy.

405
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:49,355
You know in case this
mob thing don't workout.

406
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:52,958
What is it?

407
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,521
Why couldn't you drink
your milkshake just now?

408
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,445
It's too thick, I don't know.

409
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,236
Or the straw is too thin, yea?

410
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,340
What are you saying?

411
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,379
Your standard straw is only
one eighth of an inch in diameter.

412
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,625
So.

413
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,553
So. It is designed for a milk or a
lemonade or a soda not a milkshake.

414
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,039
Are you gonna give me this
million dollar idea before I die of old age?

415
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,036
Wide straws.

416
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,605
Designed especially
for thick milkshakes.

417
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,848
And get this, the best part...
guess what I call it?

418
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,078
I give up.

419
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:49,614
The "shrtaw."

420
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,486
The "shtraw?"

421
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:58,963
Yea, yea you know,
like a shake and a straw.

422
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:00,658
Together.

423
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,660
So what do you think?

424
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:04,996
Dip...

425
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,873
There's one thing you didn't
think of. And it's called...

426
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,003
The spoon.

427
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,543
When it's too hard to
suck people use a spoon.

428
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,312
Oh yea?

429
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,969
So how come you didn't
use a spoon just now?

430
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,012
Maybe it's because
he enjoys sucking.

431
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:34,093
Hey you better back
off before I crown you.

432
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,398
What is it they say? We often
hurt those who we love the most.

433
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,413
No actually what they say is
we often kill those we hate the most.

434
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,975
Oh I love it when you get
mad. Kinda gets me hot.

435
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,011
Boy you're really disgusting.

436
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,524
I don't think my little Joey
would appreciate you talking to

437
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,028
his girlfriend in
that demeaning tone.

438
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:01,786
Girlfriend?

439
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,575
Since when are you
his girlfriend?

440
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,326
Since he told me last night.

441
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:09,694
Bye boys.

442
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,715
Why didn't you tell me!

443
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,739
But it ain't true!

444
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,989
I tell you the short position
got no room for fruits like you.

445
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,093
This here's Brooklyn.
Listen to me, it ain't true!

446
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,596
Now get out of here before I kill
you. Don't even think on coming back.

447
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,140
Boss, please, no!
Son of a bitch.

448
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,731
Are you ok, Ruffo?

449
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,433
Yea.

450
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,138
Gianfranco, Dip, get in here!

451
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,087
With Ruffo it was obvious
things weren't exactly kosher.

452
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,155
If you get my drift.

453
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:14,336
He lacks the kind of desire for
women's flesh that most of

454
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,062
us would consider to be natural.

455
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:20,464
Boss. How'd you know that
things were un-kosher with Ruffo?

456
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,640
We went out to get
some drinks at Alfie's...

457
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,283
Ruffo ordered something
called the Pink Panties.

458
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:31,714
And when the waitress brings it, it's
got this little umbrella sticking out of it.

459
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,877
An umbrella?

460
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,625
Yea... one of those
little paper ones.

461
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,209
But what's worse is, Ruffo
doesn't even take it out of his drink.

462
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,341
That's all he did?
That's all he had to do!

463
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:48,070
Cause if anyone could
tell you who's a softy,

464
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:49,494
if you get my drift,
it's Joe Aorta.

465
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,696
So...

466
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,201
You boys got this week's
protection money?

467
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:08,846
Thanks.

468
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:10,415
Hey!

469
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,217
And I wanna talk to you about
introducing me to Glorice.

470
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:16,687
I saw her last night...

471
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,458
And she's quite a woman.

472
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:28,210
And notice please how I do
not refer to someone as

473
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,602
special as Glorice as a broad.

474
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,613
I've dated quite a few broads in
my time. But now

475
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,378
I've finally met a woman.

476
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,448
And I owe it all
to you Gianfranco.

477
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,761
No, no, no you don't
owe me anything Boss.

478
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,397
You would have met her in
Brooklyn bowling or something.

479
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,821
Bullshit. If it wasn't for you.

480
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,151
I would have never met her.
George, stand up.

481
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:57,502
I said stand up! >> Right.

482
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,704
Gianfranco, this is for setting
me up with such an incredible woman.

483
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,612
Now be in my office tomorrow at
noon. For a special surprise.

484
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,254
You wanna bite?

485
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,595
Hey George. Something wrong?

486
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,667
My life is gonna
end tomorrow at noon.

487
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,609
I think that qualifies
as something wrong.

488
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:43,275
What are you talking about?

489
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:45,711
Aorta gave me the kiss of death.

490
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,414
That wasn't the kiss of
death. That was the kiss of thanks.

491
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:55,011
That's the way you Italians are
you're always kissing each other.

492
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,390
I've been around long enough
to know the kiss of death.

493
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,727
It all adds up, Aorta
goes out with her...

494
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:08,334
Tries to go to third base reaches
down, comes up with a frankfurter.

495
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,667
I think you're getting little
paranoid here Georgie.

496
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,247
Easy for you to be casual...

497
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,785
You weren't asked to go to
Aorta's office tomorrow at noon.

498
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,974
Remember when the boss
kissed you last Easter?

499
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,791
Yea.

500
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,868
So how come you didn't cry
out then about the kiss of death?

501
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,860
Last Easter he didn't have
a reason to have me iced.

502
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,105
Now he does.

503
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,826
Gianfranco, glad you made it.

504
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,999
I want you to meet Micky.

505
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,571
Hey George, nice to meet you.

506
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,386
Micky's here as a sort
of a temporary helper.

507
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,241
Oh yea?

508
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:33,879
How you gonna be with us?

509
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,859
I should be done
in 15 minutes of so.

510
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:38,883
Micky!

511
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,985
As long as it takes for
you to finish the job.

512
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:45,700
I don't like to brag but
I can work pretty fast.

513
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,092
Enough girl talk... Micky...

514
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:29,434
Surprise!

515
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,639
Congratulations
to my conciliary.

516
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,577
You bought it hook
line and sinker.

517
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,447
And to think
Micky's only a baker.

518
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:45,209
Hey George I'm sorry
if I scared you.

519
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,152
You got me.

520
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,667
I think the desk is
better over by the door.

521
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,464
Why?

522
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:04,245
Well you'll get more fresh
air coming in through the hallway,

523
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,349
it's something to think
about in case of a heat wave.

524
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:10,793
Yea but if I'm by the door people
might think I'm Mr. Aorta's secretary.

525
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:12,717
But you are... >> Conciliary!

526
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:15,790
Which means?

527
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,694
Which means I'm Mr.
Aorta's personal advisor.

528
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,752
His confidante,
his problem solver.

529
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,122
I make sure everything
goes smoothly.

530
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,037
Sounds like a secretary to me.

531
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,988
Only broads are secretaries!
I'm a conciliary! There's a difference!

532
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,097
I see.

533
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:38,382
Now if you don't mind,
I got work to do.

534
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,374
Nice tush.

535
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,012
Hey, get the fuck out of here!

536
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,149
George, I don't know
what you're so angry about.

537
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,030
I mean you get the job of
your dreams plus you have a

538
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,374
fabulous time with me which must
be like icing on the cake.

539
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:07,766
I did not, I repeat.

540
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,537
I did not have a good time.

541
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,544
So you were faking it,
but you seemed so convincing.

542
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:22,614
Especially the end.

543
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:38,696
Coffee? >> Please.

544
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,851
I need a shrink.

545
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,754
Breath in.

546
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,590
Breath out.

547
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,465
Hey Doc... if it ain't
beating don't let me know.

548
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:11,597
I don't like bad news.

549
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,065
Breath. Again.

550
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:19,805
Have you been smart lately?

551
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:23,888
My friend here just set me
up with a sweet little dame.

552
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,489
I got a reason to live now.

553
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,879
I ain't lit up for four weeks.

554
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,455
Mr. Aorta, your heart
is better, slightly better.

555
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:35,797
Keep taking the medication,
stay off those

556
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:37,301
stogies and avoid too
much excitement.

557
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:40,577
Hey Doc. Maybe I
should take up knitting.

558
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,227
Fine, Mr. Aorta.

559
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,947
George, I was serious what
I said to him about Glorice.

560
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,237
I really like her.

561
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,174
No she's a beautiful woman.

562
00:42:58,276 --> 00:42:59,276
Tonight...

563
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:01,445
Tonight?

564
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
Tonight...

565
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:06,151
What do you mean Boss?

566
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:08,720
You know, the
birds and the bees.

567
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:11,990
Are you sure about that?

568
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:14,793
Yea. I mean I love her.

569
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:16,895
That's for sure.

570
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,505
Well then maybe you should
wait, you know, not for nothing.

571
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:26,041
Women you like you sleep with, a
woman you love, waiting it better.

572
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,874
I know... but I can't help it!

573
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,308
I'm impatient.

574
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,379
What about what the church says?

575
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:36,681
The church?

576
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,103
Gianfranco, you think it makes a
difference to the guy upstairs?

577
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,427
I've already broken every
commandment there is.

578
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:49,003
I don't think one small indiscretion is
gonna make one whole hell of a difference.

579
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,027
Do you?

580
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,142
Well what about what the Doc says?
You know not too much excitement...

581
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,086
Gianfranco, is there
something wrong with her?

582
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:01,773
No... I just want this to
work out for you two.

583
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,710
Oh ok.

584
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,200
You know my father
Joe "The Boss" used to say...

585
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,894
There's only two things you say to a
woman, get over here, and get out of here.

586
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,797
Well, get over here.

587
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,868
Oh Joe you're such an animal.

588
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:33,772
Oops.

589
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:43,257
Hey Boss, Marciano's
fighting at The Garden

590
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:45,016
you wanna take Glorice
to see the fight?

591
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,755
Gianfranco, can't
you see we're busy?

592
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,950
If I want the sports
calendar I'll read the paper.

593
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,293
Just checking.

594
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,220
Hey Boss. >> Now what is it?

595
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,684
You want me to drive so
you can take Glorice to dinner?

596
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:12,047
That's it, Gianfranco, out of
the car! I wanna talk to you.

597
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,486
Gianfranco, what is it with you?

598
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:26,667
What do you mean?
What do I mean?

599
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:30,404
You keep interrupting us every 10
seconds. I thought you were a friend here.

600
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:33,308
I am but I've never been conciliary,
I wanna make sure things go right.

601
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:39,201
You ever consider that shutting up
might be what I need from a conciliary!

602
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:44,418
Hey look, I'm sorry, don't
worry about it, I know you're

603
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:46,854
trying you're best, maybe
you should just wait out here

604
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:48,313
and things will work out better.

605
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:50,448
Besides...

606
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,796
It's a little tough getting it
up with another guy around.

607
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,954
You know?

608
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,425
Where were we?

609
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:23,981
What's wrong!

610
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,551
Well Joey, it's a female thing.

611
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,519
Oh... I get it.

612
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,042
I'm sorry, it's not your fault.

613
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,592
I guess.

614
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:37,863
Just bad timing.

615
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:41,545
But maybe there is
something I can do.

616
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,400
Gianfranco, guess what?

617
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,037
I don't know.

618
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,406
Glorice and I we're getting
married!

619
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,246
You sure about this?

620
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,968
After Rita, God rest her soul
I didn't think I could do it again,

621
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:07,851
but Glorice...

622
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:13,156
She makes me feel like a kid.
I see things in color now.

623
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:16,992
The green trees, the smell
of the air, can you smell it?

624
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:19,596
Yea.

625
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,672
C'mon, really smell it with
me! Breath in, breath out.

626
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:25,971
Breath in, breath out.

627
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:30,175
I think I'm ready for more.

628
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,216
Where were we?

629
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:42,020
I'm gonna miss you.

630
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,967
Oh Joey, you're only
gonna be gone an hour.

631
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:47,511
45 minutes.
But it's still too long.

632
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,560
My sweet little cannoli.

633
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,467
Gianfranco, I'll be back soon.

634
00:48:58,703 --> 00:48:59,703
Boss.

635
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:01,606
I was talking to Glorice.

636
00:49:11,016 --> 00:49:13,777
Why do I get the feeling... you're
gonna tell me you're in love now?

637
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,620
I can't believe it, you
still haven't figured it out?

638
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,550
I think I overestimated
you George.

639
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:26,361
As soon as I become Mrs. Joey "The Heart"
Aorta I'm going to blackmail your boss.

640
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:33,514
And what do you think Mr.
Aorta is gonna do when he

641
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:35,782
finds out you're
blackmailing him?

642
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,108
He's going to p. A. y.

643
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:43,314
Babycakes, no he's not.
He's going to k. I. L. l.

644
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:49,530
No... because if he tries any
funny stuff everything will

645
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:51,089
go straight to the
Brooklyn newspapers.

646
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,270
You see I've worked out
this little system with safety

647
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:58,296
deposit boxes and friendly
reporters, smart huh?

648
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:02,467
And what about me?

649
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:06,447
I mean what happens
to me after the wedding?

650
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:09,683
After you so cleverly
blackmail Mr. Aorta.

651
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,627
Well George, to be quite honest I
haven't really thought about that one.

652
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:25,389
Attractive lady.

653
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:30,412
It's gotta get done in 48
hours. >> Yea, Mr. Briles by Friday.

654
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:36,401
It ain't hard, you just
line her up and kill her.

655
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,738
It ain't what?

656
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,643
It ain't hard, it
ain't not too hard. Yea.

657
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,547
What I do ain't easy.

658
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,149
It's an art.

659
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,219
And it can't be rushed.

660
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:59,381
Think Michelangelo had to punch a
clock when he painted the Sistine Chapel?

661
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,838
Just make sure she ain't
breathing when it's done.

662
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:04,762
There's more to it than that.

663
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,366
What happens if a
witness recognizes me?

664
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,414
And alibi's, I provide
an alibi for each one of

665
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,373
my customers in case
something goes down.

666
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:21,488
I never thought of
that stuff before Georgie.

667
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:23,890
And it's always something
different, another challenge.

668
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,250
You heard of Chaulky Brigamo?

669
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:30,688
You whacked Chaulky Brigamo?

670
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,070
The guy was guarded around
the clock, never alone.

671
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:40,241
Except for every day at noon
when he used the time to

672
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:42,105
catch up on the sports
page in piece and quiet.

673
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:44,569
While sitting on his throne.

674
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:47,531
Cause he thought
it was safe there.

675
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:52,419
After two weeks of research
I designed a bullet that

676
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,403
bounces off lead pipes
but penetrates human flesh.

677
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,860
And that was the end
of Chaulky Brigamo.

678
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,304
Incredible.

679
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,306
Really incredible.

680
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:25,210
His wife and kids
didn't think so.

681
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,313
But hey... that's his problem.

682
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:54,037
Get that fucking
thing outta here.

683
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,503
But George... give it a try.

684
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:01,306
It works. >> Now!

685
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,701
Are you sure that...
a hitman is really necessary?

686
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:25,830
Dip, we went over this. Now
I don't like killing neither.

687
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,859
It's Glorice's fault, I mean
she's making it necessary.

688
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:32,837
That's not what I meant.

689
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:37,718
I've been thinking about
our problem here.

690
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:40,687
And it's based on the theory
that Aorta would flip out if he

691
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,556
found out that Glorice was
a man... but consider this

692
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,482
maybe Aorta knows.

693
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:54,425
Are you implying that Joey "The
Heart" Aorta prefers men over broads?

694
00:54:57,928 --> 00:54:59,648
Something to think about.
You're gone!

695
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,767
He's the straightest man I know.

696
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,969
Well show me proof.
He was married!

697
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,950
Yea, yea for like a year
or something, big deal.

698
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:12,986
The man's a complete
womanizer! >> Yea so we heard.

699
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,121
But have you ever
seen him with a woman?

700
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,858
A million times!

701
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:21,662
Um, two months ago when uh... that
Las Vegas show girl was visiting Brooklyn.

702
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:24,865
Ah man that Vegas show girl
she was a gift from Stumpy La Tierra.

703
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,701
And the boss gave her to
Revella who did her himself.

704
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:30,471
A broad can get laid by
more than one guy.

705
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,455
Yea well how about Annie LeDoux?
You remember her?

706
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:37,411
Annie LeDoux... had a
serious case of The Clap, you

707
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:40,235
know a smart man Confucius say,
'Don't put nose where it don't belong.'

708
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:43,508
George, will you
listen to yourself.

709
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,810
You're using a fortune cookie to
defend the boss's manliness.

710
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,499
Look, I know what I know. And
The Boss is a straight shooter.

711
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:56,229
Yea but maybe there's
something there.

712
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:58,556
Deep down, you know
something waiting to surface.

713
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:02,059
And one day, he changes.

714
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:06,597
He ain't gonna change...

715
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,435
And that's the way it
is, no more to say!

716
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:19,420
You worry too much.

717
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:21,922
Well I wouldn't
worry if the wedding

718
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:24,791
was next month or next
week but it's tomorrow.

719
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:27,215
There's still time. Frank
Briles always completes the job.

720
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:32,566
Understand? >> Oh... oh, oh...

721
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,793
Mr... Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Artiste,
Mr. Pablo Picasso with a hitman.

722
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:39,730
I should have known. >> Hey.

723
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:42,833
Do you know what my
kill percentage is?

724
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:46,089
What do I look like?
A statistician?

725
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:50,941
100% 47 contracts, 47 kills.

726
00:56:53,478 --> 00:56:55,438
It don't get any better than
that. >> It couldn't.

727
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,147
I don't think...

728
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,751
Right, Dip.

729
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:03,621
I have a perfect record.

730
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,995
No arithmetic here,
that shit's in the past.

731
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:11,153
In every case I've ever taken
there always comes a break.

732
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:17,605
Take the example of Robby Castellano
the most paranoid gangster of all times.

733
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:20,616
I mean this guy was just
waiting to get whacked.

734
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,510
Kept a piece under his pillow...
that was the opening I needed.

735
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,615
I snuck into his house stole the
gun, made a small adjustment...

736
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,265
That night I just
tapped on the window

737
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,969
and let that fat fuck's
paranoia take over.

738
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:52,136
Don't worry George, I guarantee
you the job will be done.

739
00:57:55,372 --> 00:58:00,186
We've got pastrami,
salami, turkey, beef tongue,

740
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,289
chicken salad, chicken liver,
chopped chicken

741
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,815
Sam, just give us the best.

742
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:10,163
And make sure there's
enough for everybody.

743
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:14,000
Oh I can do something spectacular
but it may cost you a pretty penny.

744
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:18,171
Ain't nothing too expensive
for Glorice's wedding honey.

745
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,635
She's going to be the most
beautiful bride in the whole world.

746
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:22,967
Like a modern day Helen of Troy.

747
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:29,082
Hey, I got your information
right here, how about I have

748
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:31,985
one of my workers deliver a
complete meal over to your

749
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,129
place... salad, main course,
the whole works, tonight?

750
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,781
About six

751
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:39,863
I'll be looking forward to it.

752
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,794
How you doing
this wonderful day!

753
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:53,030
Roast beef on rye.

754
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,599
Make it bloody.

755
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,112
George... I caught a break.

756
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:09,979
And?

757
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:13,916
Six o'clock tonight your
problem will be solved.

758
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:19,189
I hope so. I'm getting
tired of this fucking sauna.

759
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,331
Let me get that for you.

760
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,407
Thank you.

761
00:59:40,444 --> 00:59:42,364
I wanna congratulate you
on your win tomorrow.

762
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,926
You are coming aren't you?

763
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,190
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the
world. I'm the best man.

764
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,420
Is something wrong?
Why you asking?

765
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:53,891
Well you're smiling.

766
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,663
George is so bad he smiles
when there's something wrong?

767
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:01,198
I have an idea.

768
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:08,404
The good stuff.

769
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:18,581
A toast.

770
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,719
To what?

771
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:24,989
To uh... your wedding

772
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,125
to my promotion...

773
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,160
To us.

774
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,450
George, why aren't
you being a jerk?

775
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,012
That was the old
negative George,

776
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,716
now I know everything
works out in the end.

777
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,107
What's meant to be
is meant to be.

778
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:46,711
That's beautiful.

779
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:49,746
Salud.

780
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,294
Who is it?
Delivery from Friendly Sam's.

781
01:01:07,732 --> 01:01:08,899
Oh just a second.

782
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,340
Thank you for coming. Yes, mam.

783
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,463
There you go. >> Thank you,
would you sign here please?

784
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:31,526
Do I know you from somewhere?
Uh, I don't think so.

785
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,759
Uh, put the date
in there please.

786
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:39,429
I know, I know you.
Maybe from the deli.

787
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:43,768
No not that. You
seem so familiar.

788
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,804
I got it!

789
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,593
Frank's the name,
but I don't have any nieces.

790
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,864
Oh well I used to
be one of your nephews.

791
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:58,415
It's me Gary, Gary Calshime.

792
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,270
I don't buy it lady. Googoo.

793
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,773
Excuse me?
You used to call me Googoo.

794
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:09,469
You took me to the Dodger
games, you taught me.

795
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,693
"Take me out to the ball game,
take me out to the park."

796
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:15,364
Googoo!

797
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,233
It is you!

798
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:34,351
Oh! Oh! Here he is!

799
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:38,455
The hired help. The
contract killer.

800
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:43,828
Grim Reaper. >> Michelangelo
of the murderers.

801
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:46,096
George, I gotta talk to you.

802
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:50,343
Have some bubbly.
George, listen to me.

803
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,512
You're going to relax!
George, there was a problem!

804
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:55,048
Who is painful?

805
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:58,943
Let's say I'm only 98% effective
now but there's a good side to this.

806
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,414
I got what you call...
a money back guarantee.

807
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,293
George, take it easy.

808
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,542
George, somebody could get
hurt. >> I'll kill you!

809
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:22,598
But I don't fuck up!

810
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:26,669
Fucker.

811
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,792
Mr. George Gianfranco,
put your hands in the air!

812
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:49,193
Now take a step forward, slowly!

813
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,560
Now tough guy!

814
01:03:53,898 --> 01:03:54,875
Ooh, my balls!

815
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:55,899
My balls!

816
01:03:57,701 --> 01:04:00,613
You should have thought
of your fucking balls

817
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,557
before you put your piece
in the back of my head.

818
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:11,515
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

819
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:16,662
Don't shoot, don't shoot? Why?
You gonna take my birthday away?

820
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,566
You'll go straight to
the chair in Sing Sing.

821
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:20,489
For what?

822
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:26,147
Hey, hey I don't mean to hurry
you but I got a wedding to go to.

823
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,133
Sgt. Mark Ellesberry,
draft detective.

824
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:34,895
United States Navy. You shoot a federal
agent and you'll get the chair for sure.

825
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,607
What do you want from me?

826
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:42,288
George Gianfranco, Brooklyn,

827
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:44,472
wanted for evading service
with the United States Navy.

828
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:49,223
Hey I went for my physical two
years ago and I was classified 4F.

829
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:50,819
For what!

830
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:54,657
Flat feet.

831
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:56,392
What?

832
01:04:57,794 --> 01:04:58,794
Flat feet!

833
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:02,599
Well!

834
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:08,175
I don't believe it, you wanna see
'em? >> Draft dodging is a serious crime!

835
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:09,872
Alright already.

836
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:17,114
Oh... oh, ok.

837
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:20,326
Well it ain't a
flower it's a flat foot!

838
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,062
Alright, put 'em away!

839
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:23,220
Ok. Ok.

840
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:30,812
Right, sir. Well I think we can
straighten this whole thing out.

841
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:33,096
You better.

842
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:35,498
Gun, please.

843
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:40,981
Oh, uh, one more thing.
I need to know if you recognize

844
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:42,406
any more of the
suspects in my book.

845
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,386
Hey, do I look
like a rat to you?

846
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,588
You know we might
have to go before

847
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,372
the judge to straighten
this whole thing out.

848
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:52,868
Alright, I got you. Alright.

849
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:54,650
No.

850
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:57,086
No.

851
01:05:58,355 --> 01:05:59,355
No.

852
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:01,324
No.

853
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:03,626
N...

854
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:20,144
What's the rap?

855
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,091
Good luck Mr. Aorta!

856
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:46,603
The recipe... for all great
marriages is the same.

857
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,442
It contains two very
special ingredients.

858
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:55,379
A man and a woman.

859
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:01,385
Those two ingredients are
necessary for the recipe to work!

860
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,655
Without them you don't
have anything at all!

861
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:12,396
Now.. Today.

862
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:18,802
I will be the cook for
the recipe of Aorta pie.

863
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,678
I offer those those uh... of you
who don't understand my metaphor.

864
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:34,418
I will officiate the marriage
of Joseph Carlo Aorta,

865
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:42,292
and Glorice Pearl...
uh... Coushime.

866
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:51,701
Now, let's all rise... and
welcome the beautiful bride.

867
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:37,614
Mr. Joseph Aorta?

868
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,463
Ladies and gentleman,
Glorice and I would

869
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,167
like to thank everybody
for coming today...

870
01:09:21,425 --> 01:09:23,969
Glorice had a family
emergency so the

871
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,713
marriage will not be
performed at this time.

872
01:09:28,232 --> 01:09:30,712
We will however be rescheduling
the wedding in the near future.

873
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:34,069
Sorry.

874
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:36,272
Thanks for coming.

875
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:43,258
I don't know... maybe her
mother passed away or something.

876
01:09:45,249 --> 01:09:46,283
Things happen.

877
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:49,486
Yea, what's the point?

878
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:52,256
You might as well
know the truth.

879
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:54,089
Boss?

880
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:04,801
Dear Joey, I'm afraid I cannot marry
you because I have found another man.

881
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:12,821
I'm leaving Brooklyn
forever, Glorice.

882
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:18,248
G... B... A... G... L...

883
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:20,984
Wait, what's GBAGL?

884
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,532
It's goodbye and good luck.

885
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,134
You know she probably didn't
have enough money for the

886
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,998
telegram so she shortened
the ending. You know?

887
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,440
Who do you think the guy is?

888
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:35,465
It's not important.

889
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:40,236
What's important is... is you
go on, you find another woman.

890
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,740
Hey... you deserve better.

891
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:49,111
C'mere.

892
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:54,518
You're a true friend Gianfranco.

893
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:06,772
I gotta tell you Dip, I used
to think happy endings was

894
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,356
just for the pictures
not for real life.

895
01:11:10,467 --> 01:11:12,478
I guess things worked
out ok, huh Georgie boy?

896
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:13,503
Ok? Try fantastic.

897
01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:18,818
I'm gonna be conciliary of
Brooklyn, you'll be my assistant

898
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:21,854
by next week and due to my
handiwork with that fucking

899
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:25,124
draft detective, Glorice is
gonna be spending a stint in the

900
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:28,518
US Navy... maybe it will
make a man out of her.

901
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:32,432
Cheers.

902
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:33,733
Cheers.

903
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:34,757
To Glorice.

904
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,494
Wherever he or she may be.

905
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:46,936
Oh woops... nature calls.

906
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:51,441
Taking wee willy
winky for a walk?

907
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,513
I'll be back in a Flash...
Gordon.

908
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:24,686
Hey cream puff what the
fuck are you looking at?

909
01:12:31,247 --> 01:12:33,850
Since when did pissing become
a... spectator sport?

910
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:41,991
You know I... I'd like to join uh...
whatever club you're in but uh.

911
01:12:44,428 --> 01:12:45,429
I gotta run.

912
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:49,666
Oh that didn't hurt.

913
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:52,067
That hurt.

914
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:57,974
That's enough boys.

915
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:03,713
You're back.

916
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,328
George?

917
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:27,002
George!

918
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:31,373
George...

919
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:33,976
Are you ok?

920
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,181
Get your big fat ugly
mug outta my face.

921
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,022
George...

922
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:48,525
What happened!

923
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,628
Where's Glorice?

924
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:55,082
I don't know...
I thought she was in the Navy.

925
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:00,903
George?

926
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,178
Nice toss, Boss!

927
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:14,249
Who was it?

928
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,640
It was nobody, Joey I
just got nervous. That's all.

929
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:22,805
I was nervous too! But I
didn't leave you at the alter.

930
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,994
I don't know how I
can ever make it up to you.

931
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,477
I could think of a thing or two
actually. >> Stop it!

932
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:33,235
How do I know you
won't do it again?

933
01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:36,873
Leave me up there facing
everybody I know.

934
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:40,094
I won't I promise.
But how can I know?

935
01:14:41,545 --> 01:14:42,646
We get married now.

936
01:14:44,548 --> 01:14:46,626
You mean today?
I mean right now.

937
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,450
We go straight to the
church and Father Doyle.

938
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:52,621
I don't think so.

939
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:56,660
Then we go on our honeymoon.

940
01:14:58,562 --> 01:14:59,929
And you know what
we can do then...

941
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:15,912
Gianfranco, glad you made it.

942
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,192
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
What happened to your face?

943
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:21,426
What?

944
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,028
Your face!

945
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,330
Oh this? >> Yea that.

946
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:29,635
Oh I uh... I uh... I went to
the racetrack, I saw this great

947
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:33,129
horse, 3:1 shot, I stood behind it...
it reared up, kicked me in the face.

948
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,364
Boss...

949
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,704
Where's the beautiful
bride to be?

950
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,617
Good day Sister.

951
01:16:01,424 --> 01:16:04,185
Nice outfit, George. A little
conservative but it looks good on you.

952
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,823
This is the end, Glorice, I
don't wanna do it but you made me.

953
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:21,020
I'm making you kill me?

954
01:16:21,044 --> 01:16:23,164
Please, at least be honest
about what you're gonna do.

955
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:27,008
You're telling me about
honesty. Your whole life is a lie!

956
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:28,684
Why?

957
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,118
Why!

958
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,758
Because... you got, you know...
and you dress like a woman.

959
01:16:37,661 --> 01:16:40,172
Well so are you. >> Well I
had to to get past your goons!

960
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:42,975
The only reason for
my body guards is

961
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:45,210
because you turned me
into the draft police!

962
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:47,234
I turned you in because
you wanna marry my boss.

963
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:50,373
Why can't I marry who I want?

964
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:53,485
Because.

965
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:54,754
Why? >> Because!

966
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:55,779
Why? >> Because!

967
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,350
He's not right for you.

968
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:05,689
Well who is, George?

969
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:31,993
Glorice in there?
Yea, with some nun.

970
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:34,249
A nun?

971
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:42,296
What the fuck!
Oh boss, no I can explain.

972
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:46,248
I can't believe it!
Joey, please.

973
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:48,732
My best friend and my fiance?

974
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:52,912
You must be the other
man from the telegram.

975
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:54,376
No! No! I'm not! I trusted you!

976
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,173
Nobody does this to Joe Aorta.

977
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,509
Give me your piece.

978
01:18:06,549 --> 01:18:09,589
Now what do you gotta say for yourself
you miserable ungrateful little prick?

979
01:18:10,787 --> 01:18:12,467
It's true Mr. Aorta,
I stole your woman.

980
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:14,823
So shoot me.

981
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,500
But don't hurt Glorice, it was
my idea. She did nothing wrong.

982
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:22,474
Joey, wait. Glorice, please.

983
01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:23,900
This is between George and me.

984
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:27,729
I think there's something
you should know.

985
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:33,977
What the...

986
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:38,446
You set me... but you!

987
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:41,083
But you!

988
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:43,485
And then you!

989
01:18:44,687 --> 01:18:45,687
In the car!

990
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:10,446
E nomini patri... e fili...
espiritu santi.

991
01:19:23,827 --> 01:19:27,539
It's uh... rather unfortunate
we are gathered here today

992
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:31,134
to bury our friend
Mr. Joseph Carlo Aorta.

993
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:37,440
I was there when our boss
breathed his last breath.

994
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,077
There was nothing I
could do to save him.

995
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:45,181
All I could do was
hold him in my arms,

996
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:48,284
and listen to his final words.

997
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:54,858
And he said to me, George

998
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,295
it's your turn.

999
01:20:02,065 --> 01:20:03,199
Take care of the men

1000
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:06,734
take care of yourself,

1001
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:10,839
but most of all

1002
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,145
take care of this
beautiful woman.

1003
01:20:18,014 --> 01:20:20,216
I know... nobody

1004
01:20:22,185 --> 01:20:24,287
could fill the shoes of
this wonderful man,

1005
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,991
but I'm gonna do my best.

1006
01:20:31,094 --> 01:20:32,195
Goodbye Mr. Aorta.
