9
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,055
You know what to do.

10
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:19,125
I don't want to
see his ugly face.

11
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:38,278
I got to go. Sweetheart,
don't mess with that dirty dog.

12
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:46,418
You okay?

13
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,823
Hey, what do you want?

14
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,791
Sorry, guys, that's my dog.

15
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,927
Boss?

16
00:04:58,764 --> 00:04:59,932
Boss?

17
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,203
It is okay.

18
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:09,074
You should take better
control of your dog.

19
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,177
I know, I just got her last
week, so I'm sorry about that.

20
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,347
C'mon, get out of here, man.

21
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,290
You need to get off the phone.

22
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:27,660
It's family time.

23
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:28,993
You need to get off the phone.

24
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:30,495
It's business.

25
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,768
Do you want a dog?

26
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,237
Thank you, sir!

27
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:00,460
Are you okay?

28
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,062
Are you okay?
Al! Al!

29
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,564
-Are you okay, Al?
-Boss, are you okay?

30
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:06,831
-Boss, what's going on?
-Dad, Dad.

31
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:10,737
-Are you okay, boss?
-Are you okay?

32
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,771
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

33
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,108
You come here a lot,
don't you?

34
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,576
How would you know that?

35
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,812
I notice everything
and everyone.

36
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,348
Gabriela.

37
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,882
Nice to meet you, Gabriela.

38
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,283
I haven't seen you here before.

39
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,987
That's because you never look.

40
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,754
College student?

41
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:40,425
Yeah, language major, you?

42
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,697
Sales. Internet sales.
Pretty interesting?

43
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,201
It's kind of late
for you, isn't it?

44
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:53,271
Yeah, it is.
My bus is late again.

45
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:57,677
It's usually here around
nine, but it'll be here soon.

46
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,478
Well, nice to meet you.

47
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:04,050
Wait, hey, you never
told me your name.

48
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,218
I know.

49
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,769
Samuel's on the right.

50
00:08:57,802 --> 00:09:00,004
He's on China's terrorist list.

51
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:04,143
And that's his brother Eric.
He's also an exile from China.

52
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,812
They're both powerful war lords.

53
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:09,981
-Is this shit real?
-Every bit.

54
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:12,850
I mean, what we're up against
here is a trip by itself.

55
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:14,452
Well, screw that,
just walk up there

56
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:17,489
and blast their asses away.

57
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:20,125
That is exactly
what we don't want.

58
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:22,827
There are factions
outside our world

59
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,298
that would lose if they found
these two guys murdered.

60
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:29,567
This case requires
a lot of finesse.

61
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,336
I'm gonna have to
bring in Steele.

62
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,304
Screw Steele,
we don't need him.

63
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,206
This type of case
is his specialty.

64
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,177
Look, Frank,
this is gonna be my case.

65
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,012
All I need's a few mercs.

66
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:42,447
We go in,
and I'll smoke 'em all out.

67
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,317
That's not how
we do things at Blackstone.

68
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,052
Look, we go in,
make 'em all disappear.

69
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,922
No trace, nothing.

70
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:53,425
And I'll make it look like
they were deep underground.

71
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:54,659
You watch.

72
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,465
What if something goes wrong?

73
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,234
Nothing will go wrong. Trust me.

74
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,856
Frank, over here.

75
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:42,495
I love this guy,
punctual as always.

76
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,496
No, no, I'm okay.

77
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,631
Sit.

78
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,203
Sit.

79
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,078
I really don't
need this, Claxton.

80
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,349
Nonsense, nothing like
a clean shave.

81
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,185
Make you feel like a new man.

82
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,256
Jose, let me do
this one, will ya?

83
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,897
Don't you love the
sound of a clean swipe?

84
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:26,038
It's almost like you
can feel each follicle

85
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,840
cutting at the base.

86
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:35,848
That was a bad,
big deal back there, Frank.

87
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,750
Damn bloodbath.

88
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,953
-I thought...
-You thought?

89
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:48,126
You rushed him, Claxton.

90
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,230
I told you it was too soon.

91
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:57,402
Yeah, the man was your
responsibility. Plain and simple.

92
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:02,540
You're getting old, Frank.
Maybe just a little bit too old.

93
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,043
I can fix this.

94
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:14,220
I'm sorry. I guess I pushed
this a little too hard.

95
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,124
Here you go.

96
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:23,062
What do you think?

97
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:36,774
Don't disappoint me, Frank.
We need Blaine.

98
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:41,614
Find him an appropriate mentor.
And don't mess up again.

99
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,471
<i>Ronus!</i>

100
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:59,691
<i>Time to it let go, old friend.</i>

101
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:02,127
There's nothing
to let go, Frank.

102
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,769
Come on, Ronus,
it's me you're talking to.

103
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,804
Everything's fine, Frank.

104
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:15,539
Just a little bit tired,
that's all.

105
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:18,309
-Just a little bit tired?
-Yeah.

106
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:21,746
Put up your fists. C'mon.

107
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,182
C'mon, get your fists up.
Up, up, up!

108
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,754
Back in the day,
you would've parried,

109
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,254
you would've lay three
punches in my gut

110
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:32,124
before I even could breathe.

111
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:36,561
Did you come here to give me
a boxing lesson, Frank?

112
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:37,796
No.

113
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,067
I need you to work
with a protege.

114
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,403
I work alone, Frank.

115
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,739
Hear me out. I brought Blaine
into the organization.

116
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,108
Blaine?

117
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,776
Are you kidding me?

118
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,411
The guy's a loose cannon.

119
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,913
I heard about what
happened in Chinatown,

120
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:58,783
and we still don't know the
repercussion of that case, Frank.

121
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,951
It was my fault
that I never should...

122
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:02,954
So now you're
cleaning up his mess?

123
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:04,455
He's good.

124
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,792
But maybe he's not
as good as he thinks.

125
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,460
I see.

126
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:13,397
So they want me to train a
psychopath to kill, right?

127
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:17,803
They want you to train a
psychopath to control the kill.

128
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:25,510
Why didn't Claxton
come to see me directly, Frank?

129
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:28,246
Because he knew you'd say no.

130
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:29,714
So?

131
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:31,750
I need this.

132
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,793
Do this for an old friend.

133
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:50,401
I know I promised
never to mention Juarez.

134
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:56,375
This means
that much to you, Frank?

135
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,114
Consider us even.

136
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,603
-I'm so sorry.
-I'm sorry.

137
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:34,138
-I'm sorry about that.
-What are you doing?

138
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,641
Get her! Get her!

139
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:37,908
Don't let her get away!

140
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,644
What are you doing, stop!
Stop!

141
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:45,050
-Look at me!
-Don't! Stop!

142
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:04,236
She's mine!

143
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,539
-Please stop, please!
-You guys go watch, man.

144
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:11,309
You guys can watch.
Shut up!

145
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:14,746
Shut up, please, shut up!

146
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:17,915
You're gonna like this,
you're gonna like this a lot.

147
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:19,683
Please!

148
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,020
Please stop!

149
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:25,257
Please stop! Please!

150
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,742
-Why did you kill her?
-I didn't kill anyone, I swear!

151
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,345
Yeah, you did!
Why did you do it?

152
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:49,080
I didn't kill anybody!

153
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,981
I didn't kill anybody.

154
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:52,817
We just wanted to have
some fun, I'm sorry!

155
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:55,586
My God,
please don't hurt me!

156
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,222
I didn't kill anybody, I swear!

157
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:01,226
We thought it was fun.
Don't hurt me!

158
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,210
What are you doing?

159
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:22,614
No, no, no.

160
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,250
The police will be here soon.

161
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:30,788
Remember what
I'm going to tell you.

162
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:34,225
You didn't see
what happened, okay?

163
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:36,894
You cannot tell them about me.

164
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:39,964
You'll be alright.

165
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:43,067
You gotta trust me.

166
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,884
Of course Claxton
would send you.

167
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,289
How long did we know each other?

168
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,926
Fifteen, 20 years?

169
00:24:58,362 --> 00:24:59,865
I forget.

170
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,836
I chose that team.

171
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,414
If it was anybody else
who had do this...

172
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:23,054
I wouldn't want it.

173
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:33,531
Time.

174
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,004
Thanks for making it easy.

175
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,614
See you on the other side.

176
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:33,357
Hey, stranger.

177
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:37,694
I missed you last night.

178
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,063
I didn't know you
were waiting for me.

179
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:41,231
Internet sales, right?

180
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,036
Do you wanna take a seat?

181
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,008
I'm gonna go back
to my usual table.

182
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,297
So, you know my name,
and I still don't know yours.

183
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:16,366
Ronus, Ronus Steele,
that's my name.

184
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,537
That's a name.

185
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:22,941
Okay, Ronus Steele,
spill it out.

186
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:28,679
You come here every
night with your iPad,

187
00:27:28,712 --> 00:27:31,148
you sit on the same table.

188
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,852
You sit there for hours,
you drink black straight coffee,

189
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:36,086
and then you leave.

190
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:39,489
So you can't be married
or even have a girlfriend,

191
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:41,492
so I'm guessing a dog?

192
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:44,194
A wife.

193
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,535
She died.

194
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,971
I am so sorry,
I didn't know...

195
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,839
That's okay,
I'm dealing with it.

196
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:58,710
Sometimes good to
talk out loud, you know?

197
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:03,548
I recently lost my dad.

198
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:11,489
So it's getting really late,
and I should go.

199
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:13,625
But I'll see you around?

200
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,761
Do you need a ride?

201
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:24,035
Yeah, but how do I know
that you're not a weirdo

202
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:28,306
or something like
that?

203
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:31,375
You don't.
But I'm not.

204
00:28:34,244 --> 00:28:35,779
Okay.

205
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:38,716
Sure, let's go,
but I gotta warn you,

206
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,518
I'm really good in self-defense.

207
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,619
-Really?
-Yeah.

208
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:44,956
I do cardio kickboxing
at the gym.

209
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,825
I'm not gonna
mess with you then.

210
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:58,135
Close the door! Shit!

211
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,704
Get up.

212
00:29:01,238 --> 00:29:02,440
Dude.

213
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:05,076
Get up!

214
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:10,381
You move, I empty your
fuckin' brains on the floor.

215
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:12,383
What the hell you doin' here?

216
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,953
He's a friend of yours?

217
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,726
Ouch!

218
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,695
You didn't tell me
he's so rough.

219
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,905
If I got to babysit,
it's gonna start today.

220
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,807
You got five minutes.

221
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,509
Yeah...

222
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:45,616
Give me the gun.

223
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:49,153
Give me that gun.

224
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:50,420
Give me...

225
00:29:53,723 --> 00:29:57,528
-I like that.
-Not so funny anymore?

226
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,196
Do you wanna play?

227
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,903
Alright, 007
let's do this quick.

228
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:09,573
Frank told me I was gonna
go with you on a hit.

229
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:11,776
This is not a game, pal.

230
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:14,144
Feels like one to me.

231
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,680
Frank is dead.

232
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,650
We all gotta go sometime.

233
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:39,069
Never take your eyes
off of the target.

234
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:50,815
<i>Lesson number one,</i>

235
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:56,019
<i>never take your
eyes off the target.</i>

236
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:01,425
<i>Lesson number two,
you don't kill anybody</i>

237
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:05,062
<i>that doesn't deserve to die.</i>

238
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:09,366
<i>Lesson number three,
stay focused on the target.</i>

239
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:13,704
<i>Never take your
eyes off the target.</i>

240
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,339
<i>Lesson number four,</i>

241
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:19,543
<i>always let them see you coming.</i>

242
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:24,081
<i>It drops their guard,
you get closer to the target.</i>

243
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:27,919
<i>Lesson number five,
immobilize your target.</i>

244
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:32,155
Tomorrow you'll have
the chance to see my magic.

245
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:39,096
You don't look too good.

246
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,798
Need to get some rest.

247
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,702
Dumb-ass.

248
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:17,233
Good morning, sir,
what can I get for you?

249
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,336
Large coffee, black.

250
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:21,571
Would you like a shot of
cinnamon or vanilla sprinkles?

251
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:22,573
Just black, are you deaf?

252
00:32:22,605 --> 00:32:25,643
Okay, okay,
that'll be $2, please.

253
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:30,080
Maria, large black coffee for
the cranky man that smells bad.

254
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:33,384
This is for you.

255
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,918
A man brought it
over last night.

256
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:36,854
He said you would be
in here this morning.

257
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:39,624
He also said you were
very, very smelly.

258
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:43,160
How'd you know me?

259
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:44,194
He said you were the man

260
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,497
sleeping on the park bench
across the street.

261
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:50,100
He also said you also
had a lovely personality.

262
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,537
One large coffee.

263
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,012
What a cutie.

264
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:13,091
Get in.

265
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,795
Well, if it ain't the sandman.
You thought that shit was funny?

266
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:20,230
Fuck you!

267
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:21,431
Just get in.

268
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:24,836
So you can put
me to sleep again? No way.

269
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,204
Just get in.

270
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:16,887
Where's your friend?

271
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,356
I don't know,
and I don't care.

272
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,657
Just a beer?

273
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:23,960
Just a beer and nothing to eat?

274
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:26,497
Yeah. I'm fine.

275
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:30,034
What time do you get off?

276
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,902
Hey, everyone, last call!

277
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:35,006
Last call, everyone.

278
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,576
-So...
-Excuse me, okay?

279
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,846
Easy, easy.

280
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:47,717
It's okay, he's just...
just rude.

281
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:48,953
always...

282
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:54,925
I got it, I got it.

283
00:35:00,496 --> 00:35:02,933
-Jess?
-Yeah.

284
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,137
You okay, baby?

285
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:09,005
Meet me at the bathroom real
quick.

286
00:35:11,574 --> 00:35:14,544
I'm gonna clean up, okay?

287
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:45,576
Hey...
it's none of your business.

288
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:47,877
Who's the big dog?

289
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:49,012
Donovan.

290
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,217
He owns this place
and everyone in it.

291
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,219
He own you?

292
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:58,722
Nobody owns me, you know that.

293
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:04,061
What if I told you,
five minutes from now,

294
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:06,797
I'm gonna beat
the shit out of him?

295
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,936
I'd say,
"Cool! Can I watch?"

296
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:22,880
Hi!

297
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:27,317
-You made it.
-Yeah.

298
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,954
I didn't think you were gonna
come by, I'm glad you did.

299
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:32,489
Do you want coffee?

300
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,326
-Not tonight.
-Okay.

301
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:41,898
So I know you're a student,
do you have a job beside study?

302
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:44,534
No, I've got a generous dad.

303
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:47,503
And your mom?

304
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:50,306
She died 10 years ago
in a boating accident.

305
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,977
Sorry about that.

306
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,313
She was mean,
and she never loved my dad.

307
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:58,248
That sounded wrong.

308
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,352
I was always closer to my dad.

309
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,088
So it hit me more when he died.

310
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:08,425
It sounds like
he was a good man.

311
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,961
He was... the best.

312
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:16,300
Are you a good man?

313
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,035
I'm trying to be.

314
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:40,217
Hey.

315
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:44,255
You handled yourself
pretty good back there.

316
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:49,193
You never told me what
you do for a living.

317
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:53,096
Kill people.

318
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,164
You kill people?

319
00:38:54,197 --> 00:38:55,666
Like a hitman?

320
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,369
Assassin.

321
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,970
Assassin.

322
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:01,938
Sexy.

323
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,742
When were you gonna tell me?

324
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:07,177
I don't know.

325
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,214
You gonna kill me?

326
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:12,148
Are you gonna tell on me?

327
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:16,252
On the contrary,
what you did to them,

328
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,155
the way you did it.

329
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:25,195
You're a little messed up,
you know that?

330
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:27,798
You didn't seem to
mind it last night.

331
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,003
Can't lie about that.
Okay, gotta go.

332
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:45,048
Let me tag along on your hits.

333
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:46,517
No way.

334
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,919
You and I could work
really well together.

335
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:51,422
Yeah, right.

336
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:54,958
I won't get in the way,
I won't. I won't.

337
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,707
Okay, be ready when I call.

338
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:11,875
Okay?

339
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:31,688
Riskin, Chuy.

340
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:37,527
Please, Mr. Steele,
I want to live.

341
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,831
The last time I see this man,
I almost not survive.

342
00:41:42,164 --> 00:41:46,336
He's like a ghost who come to my
bedroom and drop me to pieces.

343
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,478
<i>Buenas noches, amigo.</i>

344
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:16,432
Inside, you will find my
son's friend named Mickey.

345
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:19,435
He'll know how to find
the man you are looking for.

346
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:21,672
<i>Adios.</i>

347
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,275
<i>Adios, amigos.</i>

348
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,760
Get off me!

349
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:08,785
-Shut up!
-Not cool, man!

350
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:10,787
-Shut up! Shut up!
-God!

351
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,824
Shut up! Hey, you don't
have a lot of time.

352
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:15,692
What the fuck did you give me?

353
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:18,661
Shut up, shut up,
listen, wake up!

354
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:19,997
Hey, hey, hey.

355
00:43:22,231 --> 00:43:24,534
I forgot to mention
the nasty side effect.

356
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:27,436
You're gonna lose
all motor control.

357
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:29,405
Your heart is gonna
start to race.

358
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:32,375
Eventually, your blood
is gonna boil.

359
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,943
So you get the picture?

360
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:37,047
I need to know...
Hey, hey, wake up!

361
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,382
You got information I need.

362
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:39,849
Do you know a man named Raskin?

363
00:43:39,882 --> 00:43:41,817
I didn't do anything!

364
00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:44,221
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up! Shut up!

365
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:45,454
You know you don't have
a lot of time before

366
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:47,289
you bleed out of your ass

367
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:50,559
and you swallow your tongue,
so you understand that?

368
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:54,096
You understand? I need to know where
he hangs out, can you tell me?

369
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,101
-Yes.
-You can tell me? Okay.

370
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:00,470
You see this?

371
00:44:00,503 --> 00:44:03,507
Now this is gonna
save your life.

372
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,909
Not yet...

373
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:10,748
But remember... if you lie...

374
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,283
you're gonna see me again.

375
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:32,068
<i>Hey.</i>

376
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:34,937
<i>-Talk.
-Are you ready?</i>

377
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:36,039
Jeez.

378
00:44:36,072 --> 00:44:37,641
I'll text you
when I review the area

379
00:44:37,673 --> 00:44:41,378
-and I ID the target.
-Dude, just get to the point.

380
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:44,447
C'mon, just tell me,
I'm not a freakin' kid.

381
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,450
-Jeez.
-The Roxy.

382
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:50,253
When you get there,
don't do anything stupid.

383
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:52,289
Yeah, alright,
I'll see you there, bye.

384
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:56,260
C'mon, babe, gotta go
out for a kill, let's go.

385
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:39,669
Why in the hell
did you bring her?

386
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:41,004
-She's good.
-She's no good.

387
00:45:41,036 --> 00:45:43,639
I know what I'm doing, okay?

388
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:10,432
Looking good in your two
dollar shirt.

389
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:14,438
Yeah. That's real good.
Look, everybody's laughin'.

390
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:19,441
Listen...
can I ask a favor?

391
00:46:19,474 --> 00:46:21,243
Please, no shit tonight.

392
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:24,081
Goldy's good.

393
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:28,250
So what's the plan here?

394
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:30,253
Son of a bitch has
got enough protection.

395
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:31,988
What the hell is this?

396
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:35,625
I don't know. Probably a
crime boss or something.

397
00:46:35,657 --> 00:46:38,060
Shit always sticks to shit.

398
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,265
That explains a lot.

399
00:46:42,498 --> 00:46:46,735
No one shot.
For real, just play it cool.

400
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:49,171
Goldy, why wouldn't I?

401
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:51,942
Why would I do
anything to hurt you?

402
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:55,244
You know the last time you
didn't do anything to hurt me,

403
00:46:55,277 --> 00:46:57,112
it took me a month to re-open.

404
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:59,682
Listen, it behooves you.

405
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:01,585
-Alright?
-I got it.

406
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,123
I mean it,
you're like a brother to me.

407
00:47:07,056 --> 00:47:09,025
I'd do anything for you.

408
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:10,961
We're pals.

409
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,129
This shit is
getting interesting.

410
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:37,620
Where you goin'?

411
00:47:41,757 --> 00:47:43,826
We had a deal...

412
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,228
One of your boys
crossed the line

413
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,663
and raided my business.

414
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:50,699
Calm down with that,
it was a mistake, that's all.

415
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,736
You know, boys will be boys.

416
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:54,270
Screw that.

417
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:57,574
You and I both know we don't
make mistakes like that.

418
00:47:57,606 --> 00:48:00,943
Listen to me,
the east side is mine,

419
00:48:00,976 --> 00:48:04,047
and the west side
is yours for now.

420
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:08,784
For now.
That is great.

421
00:48:26,835 --> 00:48:28,704
Just statin' the facts.

422
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:31,373
The Valley Cartel are not
too happy with you right now.

423
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:32,742
What the hell are
you talking about?

424
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:34,744
I know you're not
moving enough merchandise.

425
00:48:34,777 --> 00:48:37,246
Hell, you should be
moving twice as much.

426
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,483
That's my business,
and I'm warning you.

427
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:43,286
Stay on your side of the
line or I swear to God

428
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:45,355
you'll have more trouble
than you've ever had.

429
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:49,491
Maybe.
And just maybe one day,

430
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:50,994
that trouble's gonna
come back and bite you

431
00:48:51,027 --> 00:48:52,362
-in the asshole, man.
-Son of a bitch!

432
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:56,900
Sit down!
Not here, not now.

433
00:48:56,932 --> 00:48:59,469
Sit down. Sit.

434
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,275
This is gonna blow.

435
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:07,810
Can you shut up?

436
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:11,280
Okay, I'm just fuckin' waiting.

437
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,695
Don't do it,
don't do it.

438
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:48,717
Looks like
your shit worked, man.

439
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:50,320
On the wrong fucking person!

440
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:51,653
We're fucking done.

441
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:54,289
You know what,
watch how I do it now.

442
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:56,960
Christina!
Giordano!

443
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,169
Hey! Riskin!

444
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:52,841
Listen, man,
we can make a deal.

445
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:55,911
I can give you a lot of money.
Just name me a price.

446
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:59,582
I'm sorry, Riskin,
you can't afford me.

447
00:51:59,614 --> 00:52:01,650
-What is that?
-You mean this?

448
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:02,785
Don't worry about it.

449
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:05,655
It won't hurt a bit,
it's a matter of seconds.

450
00:52:05,688 --> 00:52:06,623
You'll be fine.

451
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,157
I got a lot of money,
I'll pay you,

452
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,092
I'll make you a rich man.

453
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,095
I don't need your money.

454
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:31,047
What the hell
did you do that for?

455
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:32,248
I had him!

456
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,351
From my vantage point,
looks like he had you.

457
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:36,418
I had him!

458
00:52:36,452 --> 00:52:39,389
Have the money
and everything, you know?

459
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,590
You're such an asshole.

460
00:52:44,626 --> 00:52:46,996
Don't ever do that again.

461
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:49,432
I had him.

462
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:53,823
Hi!

463
00:54:54,956 --> 00:54:56,792
Are you stalking me?

464
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,661
This is where
you go to college?

465
00:54:58,693 --> 00:55:02,864
Yep, you're probably
not very good at it.

466
00:55:02,898 --> 00:55:04,200
At what?

467
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:07,135
You're funny.

468
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:09,471
You really don't
strike me as a salesman.

469
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:12,307
They're usually very outgoing
and talkative and you're not.

470
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,476
Thank you.

471
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:15,645
I'll see you tonight?

472
00:55:15,677 --> 00:55:18,547
I can't tonight,
I have lab, but tomorrow?

473
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:21,684
Sure.

474
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,997
Why her?

475
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,434
Nice, but you know I don't
mix business with pleasure.

476
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:52,802
Everything's in the dossier.

477
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:55,338
There's nothing there.

478
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,507
This one is special.

479
00:57:57,539 --> 00:57:59,842
You know I don't
work that way.

480
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:02,945
Ronus, you're a
goddamn executioner.

481
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:05,581
This one doesn't feel right.

482
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:08,217
It's not your call.

483
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,019
Ronus, I know you're
getting cozy with her.

484
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:14,022
If that's tainting
your abilities...

485
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,794
-It hasn't.
-Then what's the big deal?

486
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:24,133
Look, if you feel
so strongly about it, walk away.

487
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:26,602
I'll assign someone
else to the case.

488
00:58:26,635 --> 00:58:29,338
No one goes on this case.

489
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:32,441
Ronus, I'm gonna forget we
had this conversation today.

490
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:36,879
I'm also gonna forget that you
interfered with my work flow.

491
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:40,048
But I'm not gonna forget
that you have a job to do.

492
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:43,219
And I expect you to
follow through with it.

493
00:58:56,065 --> 00:59:00,135
Turn that shit down!
How am I supposed to work?

494
00:59:14,983 --> 00:59:16,119
Much better.

495
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:34,503
<i>Man, I love this
Mission Impossible shit.</i>

496
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:36,438
What's that?

497
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,607
Next case.

498
00:59:46,414 --> 00:59:49,719
What a shame,
she's kinda cute.

499
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:52,722
No, she's not.

500
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:58,061
Well, we all
gotta go sometime.

501
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,604
-Holy shit.
-What?

502
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:12,108
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

503
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:15,577
Alright, get dressed.
We got some work to do.

504
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,492
Hey.

505
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:31,861
Are you okay?

506
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:34,663
Yeah. I'm okay.

507
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,066
Nah, you don't look good.

508
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,635
Let's go for a ride.

509
01:00:40,635 --> 01:00:41,903
Sure.

510
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:03,359
That's cool,
we don't need to talk.

511
01:01:03,391 --> 01:01:05,360
I have something
I have to tell you.

512
01:01:05,393 --> 01:01:07,896
I never like a
conversation that begins with,

513
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:11,299
"There's something
I have to tell you."

514
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:14,436
Why don't we go get a drink?

515
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:19,775
There's a nice place
here on Albany Road. I'm buying.

516
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,786
Ronus, you're making this
too easy for me, buddy.

517
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:35,758
Can you handle the girl?

518
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:38,860
Are you serious?

519
01:01:46,635 --> 01:01:49,472
What do you want to talk
about that's so important?

520
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:52,908
Actually, I'm not a salesman.

521
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,476
See? I knew it.

522
01:01:57,945 --> 01:01:59,715
Ronus, what's wrong?

523
01:02:00,681 --> 01:02:03,418
Hey, you're really
stressed out these days.

524
01:02:03,452 --> 01:02:07,123
I think you need a
vacation, a few days off.

525
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:09,025
Just to clear your head,
you know?

526
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,394
I could go with you if you want.

527
01:02:13,661 --> 01:02:16,097
You know what, yeah,
that sounds like a great idea.

528
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:17,165
-Really?
-Yeah.

529
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,737
Let's go to Tahoe.
It's so beautiful.

530
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:26,574
You know, I remember
when I was a little girl,

531
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:30,780
my dad, he used to take
us there all the time.

532
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,948
Best time of my life.

533
01:02:32,981 --> 01:02:34,750
Do you like camping?

534
01:02:34,782 --> 01:02:36,618
Hey, Ronus.

535
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:43,391
Who's that?

536
01:02:43,425 --> 01:02:46,262
A friend of mine.
Just give me five minutes.

537
01:02:54,735 --> 01:02:58,406
So ain't you gonna introduce
me to your lady friend?

538
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:01,711
Dude, holding out on me.

539
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:08,817
What are you doing here?

540
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,854
Just want to spend some time
with a good buddy, that's all.

541
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:17,759
After all,
I'm your apprentice, right?

542
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:21,096
You're just an asshole.

543
01:03:30,304 --> 01:03:33,708
I also kind of figured
that you won't be able to

544
01:03:33,742 --> 01:03:37,246
get the job done, so here I am.

545
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,485
This is my case.

546
01:03:44,518 --> 01:03:46,621
I can take care of
my own business.

547
01:03:46,655 --> 01:03:48,490
Dude...

548
01:03:48,523 --> 01:03:51,594
She's a little young
for you, you know that?

549
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:58,901
Tell me...

550
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:03,104
Does she know what
you do for a living?

551
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:07,143
I mean, would it ruin things?
Would she like it?

552
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:12,547
We both know why I'm here.

553
01:04:52,086 --> 01:04:55,590
Hey, thank you
for helping me back there.

554
01:04:55,623 --> 01:04:58,393
-What?
-Yeah.

555
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,630
I really did, didn't I?

556
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,666
What's this.

557
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,936
Hey, don't touch that.

558
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:08,170
-Why not?
-Give it here.

559
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:09,704
What?

560
01:05:09,737 --> 01:05:11,105
Why is there a
picture of me here?

561
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:13,041
Give it here, it's nothing.

562
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:15,210
They were there to kill me?

563
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,245
Ronus, what the hell?

564
01:05:17,278 --> 01:05:19,949
You're a hitman, too,
aren't you?

565
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:23,818
You've killed people!

566
01:05:27,856 --> 01:05:30,226
I'm in a car with a killer.

567
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:37,298
I'm going to
take you somewhere safe.

568
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:39,734
I must be out of my mind.

569
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:52,914
Where are we?

570
01:05:52,947 --> 01:05:55,049
This is a safe place.

571
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:56,485
We cannot go back
to the same place,

572
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:58,353
they'll be looking for us.

573
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,556
Why do I have a hit on me?

574
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:17,271
There's enough ammo
here to hold off an army.

575
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:20,108
Why are you giving me a gun?
I thought this was a safe house.

576
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:24,813
It is a safe house,
we cannot be too safe. Take it.

577
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:45,067
Geez, put it down...

578
01:06:52,873 --> 01:06:54,909
Don't touch anything, okay?

579
01:06:54,943 --> 01:06:59,081
This asshole likes to put chemicals
on shit around that put you to sleep.

580
01:06:59,981 --> 01:07:01,650
Don't touch anything, I said!

581
01:07:01,682 --> 01:07:04,954
C'mon, move, just stay here.
Stay here and don't move.

582
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,858
Shit.

583
01:07:09,891 --> 01:07:11,494
All locked.

584
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,313
Look at this!

585
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:35,651
Don't touch anything,
I said, what are you, deaf?

586
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,885
Let me see that.

587
01:07:36,918 --> 01:07:38,820
-No!
-Give it back.

588
01:07:42,556 --> 01:07:43,692
Talk.

589
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:53,201
-Take it off, now!
-No.

590
01:07:59,507 --> 01:08:00,809
Nice things.

591
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:04,045
Whose were they?

592
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,182
Someone I knew a long time ago.

593
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:09,684
It's a little weird
wearing her stuff.

594
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:11,286
I'm sure she's okay.

595
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:15,791
Who are you, Ronus,
if that's even your real name?

596
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:18,793
It is.

597
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,896
I worked for a
security company with a

598
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:25,167
friend of mine long time ago.

599
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:28,269
He showed me how to rid of
some scums from this earth

600
01:08:28,302 --> 01:08:30,506
and get paid for it.

601
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:35,076
At the time, it sounded pretty
good, so I took the job.

602
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:37,979
First time, it was scary.

603
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:44,487
I thought a lot about
the guy I eliminated.

604
01:08:46,054 --> 01:08:47,323
Killed?

605
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:54,963
He murdered five innocent people
in a supermarket while robbing it.

606
01:08:56,831 --> 01:08:58,634
Later on that night,

607
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:01,202
he raped a woman.

608
01:09:02,103 --> 01:09:04,306
And beat her unconscious.

609
01:09:08,076 --> 01:09:10,612
It was a politician's mistress.

610
01:09:10,645 --> 01:09:14,682
And you don't mess with
politician's mistress.

611
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:22,358
So how do you do it,
you know, kill them?

612
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,298
I don't like guns.

613
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:33,001
I don't like knives,
it's too personal.

614
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:34,869
I was a chemist.

615
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:37,673
I used a combination
of agents to kill.

616
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,942
So you mean poison?

617
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:43,512
In the end, yes,
you're right, it's poison.

618
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:45,914
Can be fast...

619
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:48,951
Or painfully slow.

620
01:09:51,252 --> 01:09:53,021
Depends on the case.

621
01:09:53,954 --> 01:09:56,992
So you're God,
you pass judgement?

622
01:09:57,024 --> 01:09:58,626
No, I'm not God.

623
01:09:59,793 --> 01:10:02,096
God works too slow for me.

624
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:07,569
So am I one of your cases?

625
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:08,863
Hi, I have an appointment
with Dr. Camacho.

626
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:10,298
Your appointment is here.

627
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,967
Thank you.

628
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:19,308
Hi, Dr. Camacho?
Gabriela Dresden.

629
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,143
Ms. Dresden, nice to meet you.

630
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,378
The report came in,
and at first,

631
01:11:23,411 --> 01:11:26,981
I thought cardiac arrest
might be the initial C.O.D.

632
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:30,452
I looked closer and found
discoloration on his skin,

633
01:11:30,484 --> 01:11:33,154
consistent of Botulinum.

634
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,556
Yeah, but what does that mean?

635
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:37,125
Botulinum is a
very deadly poison.

636
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:39,227
I almost missed it
in the tox report.

637
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:42,030
Very fast, lethal and effective.

638
01:11:45,466 --> 01:11:46,934
Thank you.

639
01:12:08,122 --> 01:12:09,557
Hey, beautiful.

640
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:16,497
Alright, come on,
let's go say hi to Ronus.

641
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:21,970
Excuse me!

642
01:12:25,372 --> 01:12:28,676
Hi, could you please show
me to the records window?

643
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,846
Certainly, yeah, straight
down this corner on the left.

644
01:12:30,878 --> 01:12:32,012
You can't miss it.

645
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:34,316
On the left, okay, thank you.

646
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:38,386
This way? Thanks.

647
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,096
-Where is she?
-Just give a minute.

648
01:12:48,128 --> 01:12:49,931
Fucking cops inside.

649
01:12:52,734 --> 01:12:54,636
What a waste of time.

650
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:58,907
When she comes out,
we're gonna follow her.

651
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:01,042
She'll lead us to Ronus.

652
01:13:03,778 --> 01:13:06,347
That place is freakin'
crawling with cops today.

653
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:10,085
Shouldn't their fat asses be
eating some donuts or something?

654
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,521
-Freakin' pigs.
-Hey.

655
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,523
You know, I never liked donuts.

656
01:13:15,957 --> 01:13:19,594
-This your car?
-Yeah.

657
01:13:19,627 --> 01:13:21,029
You probably
know you're illegally parked

658
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:22,831
in an emergency vehicle zone.

659
01:13:22,863 --> 01:13:24,865
No, I don't know, I don't
see any signs or anything here.

660
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:27,536
And your tags are expired.

661
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,703
Shit, that's great.

662
01:13:28,735 --> 01:13:29,871
Let me get
your driver's license,

663
01:13:29,904 --> 01:13:32,107
registration
and proof of insurance.

664
01:13:34,074 --> 01:13:36,478
Where's the registration?

665
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:45,253
I don't know what that is.

666
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:56,198
Well, Mr. Beasley.

667
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,300
Your luck just
keeps getting worse.

668
01:13:58,332 --> 01:14:01,969
-These are both expired.
-No, they're not.

669
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:04,472
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to tow your vehicle.

670
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:06,041
Are you kidding me?

671
01:14:06,073 --> 01:14:11,045
Hey, Mr. Officer, I just
hitched a ride with Mr. Beasley.

672
01:14:11,078 --> 01:14:13,614
I don't really know him.

673
01:14:13,648 --> 01:14:16,150
Okay, you can go.

674
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:17,351
-Really?
-Mr. Beasley here

675
01:14:17,385 --> 01:14:19,188
has to sign a citation.

676
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:22,391
Step out of the car, sir.

677
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:42,871
You bailed on me?

678
01:15:42,904 --> 01:15:45,540
While you were busy making
friends with the police,

679
01:15:45,573 --> 01:15:47,676
this bitch followed her.

680
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:50,779
And how the hell
did you follow her?

681
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:52,780
You're the only one with skills.

682
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:54,716
<i>I'm parked on the
side of the road.</i>

683
01:15:54,748 --> 01:15:57,685
I'll text you directions.

684
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,520
You still have
your phone, right?

685
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:01,422
Well, you're talking to me.

686
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:02,990
But you don't have a car.

687
01:16:03,024 --> 01:16:05,160
The buses are still running.

688
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:07,061
Just shut up, I'll get there.

689
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:25,646
Jesus,
where the hell did you go?

690
01:16:26,546 --> 01:16:28,082
Where were you?
Next time you leave,

691
01:16:28,115 --> 01:16:30,484
please do me a favor
and let me know.

692
01:16:30,518 --> 01:16:33,721
That'd be great, thank you.

693
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,890
I went to the
coroner's office, okay?

694
01:16:35,922 --> 01:16:38,359
My dad died a month ago.

695
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:41,596
I just wanted to see
what happened to him.

696
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,534
Hey.

697
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,618
I was just worried
about you, okay?

698
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,413
Do you think he's dead?

699
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:40,381
What the fuck,
there's only two of them inside.

700
01:18:40,413 --> 01:18:41,682
You wanna go in, go!

701
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:43,518
Stay back, look,
I'm the assassin here,

702
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:46,588
you're just along for the
ride, don't forget that!

703
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:30,083
-Did you see that?
-Shit!

704
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:31,286
I'm standing right here.

705
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:32,654
He just took
out all your guys.

706
01:21:32,686 --> 01:21:34,823
Well, why the hell do you
think I send them first?

707
01:25:21,448 --> 01:25:23,084
Ronus!

708
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:44,465
Do you think
this case is over?

709
01:26:44,497 --> 01:26:45,766
Not yet.

710
01:26:46,432 --> 01:26:48,269
They will send more.

711
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:51,838
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

712
01:26:51,872 --> 01:26:54,642
I just want this to be over.

713
01:26:54,675 --> 01:26:57,744
I know we won't be
safe here anymore.

714
01:26:59,046 --> 01:27:02,149
I got some passports for us,
we can head to Mexico.

715
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:06,887
I don't think we're
gonna need those passports.

716
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:15,596
<i>I recently
lost my dad... my dad.</i>

717
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:22,270
I was hoping I was wrong.

718
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:33,381
So that was you
right from the beginning.

719
01:27:34,814 --> 01:27:35,915
Not that it matters anymore,

720
01:27:35,948 --> 01:27:40,621
but why did you go
through all this?

721
01:27:41,854 --> 01:27:44,090
How come you didn't kill me
right from the beginning?

722
01:27:44,123 --> 01:27:49,195
Claxton knew it would take
an elaborate set up like this,

723
01:27:49,229 --> 01:27:52,533
for someone to get
close enough to kill you.

724
01:27:52,565 --> 01:27:54,934
Blaine, and the others?

725
01:27:54,967 --> 01:27:58,471
Well, you did an amazing job
cleaning up their messes.

726
01:27:58,505 --> 01:28:01,007
And you made
Claxton's job easier.

727
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:04,845
You don't know how many
times I wanted to kill you.

728
01:28:04,877 --> 01:28:09,616
But I had to wait
till you finished the others

729
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:11,286
and my father.

730
01:28:13,487 --> 01:28:15,021
He never talked about you.

731
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:17,391
Would it have
made any difference?

732
01:28:17,423 --> 01:28:19,594
No emotional ties.

733
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,662
Remember?

734
01:28:22,695 --> 01:28:25,432
I loved my father,
and he trusted you.

735
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,069
Frank was my friend.

736
01:28:29,069 --> 01:28:30,805
You know,
there was a small part of me

737
01:28:30,837 --> 01:28:33,873
that wanted to be
wrong about you.

738
01:28:33,907 --> 01:28:36,543
Claxton has been
playing you and me

739
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:39,079
right from the beginning.

740
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:42,783
When you killed him,
you took a piece of me.

741
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:45,819
He knew I was going to
kill him before I did.

742
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:48,922
My dad was a good man.

743
01:28:50,757 --> 01:28:53,694
You don't know how glad I am

744
01:28:54,828 --> 01:28:58,199
that I figured out
all of your tricks.

745
01:29:03,569 --> 01:29:05,805
Not all of them.

746
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:09,110
No!

747
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:10,712
Please!

748
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:27,268
Ronus...

749
01:33:28,201 --> 01:33:30,871
-I thought you'd be...
-Dead?

750
01:33:30,904 --> 01:33:32,740
In another country by now,

751
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:36,644
enjoying the fruits
of your labor.

752
01:33:36,676 --> 01:33:39,212
Listen, whatever
you came here to do

753
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:41,248
or think you're about to do.

754
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,949
Make sure you know the outcome.

755
01:33:42,983 --> 01:33:46,020
It ends here
one way or another.

756
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,989
I'm a dead man either way.

757
01:33:49,021 --> 01:33:52,393
Ronus, it was never personal.

758
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:54,895
You became expendable,
and you know the rules.

759
01:33:54,927 --> 01:33:56,630
Hell, you made
the rules yourself.

760
01:33:56,662 --> 01:33:58,331
It was just a matter of time.

761
01:33:58,364 --> 01:34:02,737
Who knows, but my time with
the agency may be over soon.

762
01:34:04,404 --> 01:34:07,942
Maybe you're here on a case...
yourself.

763
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:11,045
Gabriela?

764
01:34:12,578 --> 01:34:14,180
Too bad.

765
01:34:14,213 --> 01:34:17,484
You know, I think she
genuinely liked you.

766
01:34:17,516 --> 01:34:20,720
I considered
taking her off the case.

767
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:24,291
Where do we go from here?

768
01:34:24,323 --> 01:34:26,393
I'm giving you a pass.

769
01:34:26,426 --> 01:34:28,228
Something you never give anyone.

770
01:34:28,261 --> 01:34:31,165
Well, that's so
gracious of you.

771
01:34:32,032 --> 01:34:33,567
I expected more from you.

772
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,204
I thought you'd be
made of sterner stuff.

773
01:34:38,137 --> 01:34:39,640
Just go ahead.

774
01:34:43,042 --> 01:34:45,478
We've got a little
standoff here.

775
01:34:46,779 --> 01:34:48,715
Let's figure this out.

776
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:51,719
I already figured it out.

777
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:54,455
Just take me off the list.

778
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:55,588
Well, I take you off the list,

779
01:34:55,622 --> 01:34:57,391
what's to stop you
from killing me?

780
01:34:57,423 --> 01:34:58,893
Nothing.

781
01:35:05,431 --> 01:35:07,635
There you go, now what?

782
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:20,413
Consider this my
retirement bonus.

783
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:27,688
You son of a bitch.

784
01:35:48,507 --> 01:35:50,211
Great job, Michael.

785
01:35:51,511 --> 01:35:52,679
You didn't really
think you could just

786
01:35:52,712 --> 01:35:55,249
walk away like that, did you?

787
01:35:57,884 --> 01:35:58,851
Need me to off him?

788
01:35:58,885 --> 01:36:01,255
No, not here in the open.

789
01:36:02,488 --> 01:36:04,757
Get the hell
out of here, Ronus.

790
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:07,594
Run as far as you can,
but know this,

791
01:36:07,627 --> 01:36:08,896
I'll be right behind you.

792
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:13,667
There's no place on God's
earth where you'll be safe.

793
01:36:13,699 --> 01:36:16,636
Somehow, I knew you'd
say something like that.

794
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,373
It's survival of the fittest.

795
01:36:24,511 --> 01:36:28,883
Consider the time you have
left of your retirement bonus.

796
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:31,317
I'm off.

797
01:37:02,582 --> 01:37:03,984
Let's get the hell out of here!

798
01:37:28,073 --> 01:37:29,475
No!

799
01:37:48,461 --> 01:37:50,597
Doing okay?

800
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:52,666
Anything else you need?

801
01:38:07,113 --> 01:38:08,249
Excuse me.

802
01:38:12,585 --> 01:38:14,354
I thought you were someone else.

803
01:38:14,386 --> 01:38:16,556
It's okay, wish I were.

804
01:38:20,092 --> 01:38:22,061
Is everything alright?

805
01:38:24,764 --> 01:38:27,333
Yeah.
I'm okay.

806
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:57,610
-Peak-a-boo.
-Screw yourself.
