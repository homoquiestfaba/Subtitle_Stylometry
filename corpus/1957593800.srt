1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,430
(bright chiming)

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,680
(suspenseful music)
(liquid sloshing)

3
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,853
(engines revving)

4
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,749
- Woohoo.
(engine roaring)

5
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:54,780
- [Man] You need some light, Archie?

6
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,950
- Sam, I'd recognize your voice anywhere.

7
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,300
You ain't fooling nobody.

8
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,001
- [Sam] You owe this town, Archie.

9
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,269
- Yeah.
- I don't owe nobody nothing.

10
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:03,227
- All right.
- You boys get the hell

11
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:04,168
outta here.
- Let's get him, come on.

12
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:05,248
- Go on, now, get outta here.
- Come on, boys.

13
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:07,092
- Yeah, let's get him.
- Let's take care of this.

14
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,835
All right now.

15
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:09,972
- Go ahead, get him.

16
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:11,360
Go ahead now.
(masked man laughing)

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,115
(glass smashing)

18
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,648
- Go on, get out.

19
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:16,713
(windows smashing)

20
00:01:16,713 --> 00:01:18,015
- [Man] Hurry up. Get in.

21
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:19,645
Get in there, come on.

22
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:22,063
- Look out.
- I ain't sellin'.

23
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:24,110
This is my five acres.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,940
I'll use 'em any way I choose.

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,250
I'll build a pyramid of empty
beer cans on 'em if I want to.

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,496
- Use less old drunk.

27
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:31,696
- I ain't scared of you.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,890
Get out!
- Watch him!

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,865
Watch yourself.

30
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:38,668
(kicks thudding)
(men yelling)

31
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:40,530
Watch him, boys.

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,870
- [Man] Get him good.

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,063
- Come on, get up.

34
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,279
- [Man] He ain't breathing.

35
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,110
- Hey, we got a problem in here.

36
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,223
- You stay here.

37
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,260
What the hell'd y'all do in here?

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,570
- We didn't touch him. He was drunk.

39
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,470
- What are we gonna do?

40
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,417
Our fingerprints are all over this place.

41
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:17,667
(coughing)

42
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,209
(tense dramatic music)

43
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:57,715
- [Man] Let's go. Get on now.

44
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,967
Come on, come on.

45
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:04,217
(flames igniting)

46
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:09,026
(men calling out)

47
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,136
Come on!

48
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:15,907
(men calling out)

49
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:21,051
- [Man] Get down outta there.

50
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,799
- [Man] Get in the truck bed, let's go.

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,417
(thoughtful music)

52
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:45,430
- Now Linda, don't do a big number.

53
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm family. Remember?

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,610
Yeah, put away the furniture
polish and think, oo,

55
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,983
messy kitchen and coffee mugs.

56
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,760
No, I don't want to face
that drive down from Dallas.

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,712
I'll take the train.

58
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:57,720
(knocking at door)

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,553
Hold on.

60
00:03:58,553 --> 00:04:00,040
- [Man] Afternoon.

61
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,433
- Yeah. Hi.

62
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,820
Well roll out that big, Texas sunset.

63
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,070
I can't wait to meet Eddie and the kids.

64
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,950
And oh and give the kids a
big, special hug for me, okay?

65
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,950
I love you too. Bye.

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,810
- I see flannel is in again.

67
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,863
- Not in my closet.

68
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,030
- What are you looking for?

69
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,267
- Oh my tickets. They were right here.

70
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,510
You know, maybe I should postpone.

71
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,690
- No. No more postponements.

72
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,410
How many years have you
promised and then now shown up?

73
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,243
- 15.

74
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,530
- Shame on you.

75
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,520
- It's not as if I didn't try to go home.

76
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,100
There was just too much blood
under the bridge, Morgan.

77
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,500
I, if I'd gone home I'd have
to pretend to forgive my father

78
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,400
and forget all the stuff I never could.

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,990
- You're not going back
to your old hometown

80
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,220
and all those bad memories.

81
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,570
Your father's dead, Martha,

82
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,950
it's safe to come outta hiding.

83
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,640
- I'm a coward, Morgan.

84
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,980
I bailed out and left Linda there

85
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,050
to deal with my dad's
drinking and the fights

86
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,980
and the craziness.

87
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,520
It killed my mother.

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,850
I thought it'd kill me too.

89
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,373
- Sounds like survival to me.

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,073
Now go home and make it right. Okay?

91
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,520
- Okay.
- Bye bye.

92
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,132
- Bye.

93
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:27,299
(train whistle blows)

94
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,784
- [Man On PA] May I have
your attention please?

95
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:40,617
Train number 21, the Texas Eagle,

96
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,129
Texarkana, Marshall, Longview,

97
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:47,712
Dallas, Fort Worth, and Taylor.

98
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:52,027
For those of you boarding
nearest Rocky Valley,

99
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:53,770
please allow a few moments

100
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,340
for incoming passengers to detrain first,

101
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,630
attendants will then help you aboard.

102
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,968
Thank you.

103
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,693
- [Man] All clear here, Bill.

104
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:06,026
(men calling out in the background)

105
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,910
(upbeat country music)

106
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,743
- Yeah. What?

107
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:39,551
Who?

108
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:42,557
No, she's busy. She can't come out.

109
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:45,791
Well call back in an hour.

110
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,973
(suspenseful music)

111
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:07,806
(door closes in the distance)

112
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:24,249
(men yelling)

113
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:32,497
- [Man] I'll get him.

114
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:34,997
(tense music)

115
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:38,379
(whip cracks)
Come on, come on.

116
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,631
(men cheering)

117
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,005
- [Man] Come on. Get up.

118
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,134
Come on. Get up.

119
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:45,073
Go on.
- Get up.

120
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:46,986
- Yeah.
(men yelling)

121
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,508
- [Man] Let me at him.

122
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,780
- [Man] He doesn't really know anything.

123
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,582
- [Man] He knows about the fire.

124
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,001
- [Man] He might cause trouble for us.

125
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,313
(man yelling)
- He's getting away again.

126
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:56,586
- [Man] Come on now.

127
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:59,817
(gunfire pops)
(man yells)

128
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:02,567
(victim wheezes)

129
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:17,455
- Oh hell, Mike.
- Is he dead?

130
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,538
- [Man] Yeah.

131
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,188
- I only meant to scare him.

132
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,210
I mean he shouldn't have bolted like that.

133
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,803
- You idiot.

134
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:31,256
- It was an accident.

135
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,606
I mean, you could see that.

136
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
- Come on. Let's go.

137
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,393
- Let's go.
- Throw it down.

138
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:41,058
- [Man] Go get the truck.

139
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:45,225
(men calling out in the distance)

140
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:57,637
(upbeat country music)

141
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:17,618
(music overpowers voices)

142
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:35,274
- [Man] That went down real good.

143
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:39,446
- Martha!

144
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,689
Don't believe it.

145
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,733
I think I'm gonna cry.

146
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,150
Oh, I'm so sorry. Eddie was
supposed to pick you up.

147
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,383
And I just can't believe you're here.

148
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,370
Can you ever forgive me?

149
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,250
Things got backed up here.

150
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,510
- What time did you get off?

151
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,150
- Well, not for awhile.

152
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,983
- I need to talk to you.

153
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:02,311
- Oh, I know. Me too.

154
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:05,530
If you can just wait
until the crowd thins out.

155
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,430
Where's your bags?

156
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:09,330
- By the door.
- They're by the?

157
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,890
Okay, they'll be safe. Come on.

158
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:14,244
Wonderful.

159
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:18,912
What's the matter?

160
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,678
- Linda, it was something-

161
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:22,511
- Linda, your order's up.

162
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:24,040
Come on, you got customers.

163
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,020
- Jake, this is my sister.

164
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,487
- Oh yeah, your sister from LA.

165
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,137
Y'all really do favor each other.

166
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:32,710
Why don't y'all go ahead and go on home.

167
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,570
I know how long it's been
since you seen each other.

168
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,403
- But Betty's off and-

169
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,510
- That's all right. I'll handle things.

170
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,060
You go on. Go on.

171
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,900
Very nice to meet you.

172
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,060
We really do like your sister.

173
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,856
- Hey Jake!
- Go on.

174
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:45,140
- [Man] We'll see y'all later.
- Jake's been great.

175
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,973
Can you believe it?

176
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,130
I actually like my boss.

177
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,433
(Linda giggles) Come on.

178
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,593
We got some pretty country out here.

179
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,280
Not a lotta nightlife.

180
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,380
But I'm sure you get enough of that in LA.

181
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:10,001
(men calling out)

182
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,370
Okay, okay, I know you're probably angry-

183
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,473
- Linda, I saw a man murdered tonight.

184
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,423
- What?

185
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,930
- I was coming from the train station.

186
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,070
- Oh my God. Are you okay?

187
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,903
I mean, you actually-

188
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:49,190
- I saw this group of men and they were,

189
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,670
they were beating this
guy and I heard the shot

190
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,230
and I saw him fall.

191
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,270
And I don't know, the one who did it

192
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,640
was, was wearing a mask.

193
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,480
- So you didn't actually see his face?

194
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,330
Yeah, he took it off and I,
and I got a good look at him.

195
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,334
- Did you call the police?

196
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,584
- No, I was just so scared.

197
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,137
- Okay, um.

198
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,270
Eddie's working late, but he'll,

199
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,082
he'll be home in a little bit
and he'll know what to do.

200
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:20,915
- Okay.

201
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:46,851
(car door closes)

202
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,987
(door squeaks)

203
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:50,203
Hi.
- Hi!

204
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:51,360
- Kids in bed?

205
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,525
- [Girl] They're playing
rabid dog in their pjs.

206
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,402
(Linda laughs)

207
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,867
- All right, well thanks, Lorraine.

208
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,151
I'm sorry, this is my sister, Martha.

209
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,450
- Hi, heard a lot about you.

210
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,584
- Hi.

211
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:06,254
(kids growling playfully)

212
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:07,960
(Lorraine laughs)

213
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,110
- Hey, is this the way you
want to meet your aunt, Martha?

214
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,562
Come here, you rabid dogs,
let me wipe off your face.

215
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,687
(Linda laughs)

216
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,945
- 'Night kids. Thanks, Linda.

217
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:18,778
Nice meeting you too.

218
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:19,780
- Nice meeting you, too.

219
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,770
- Well, Emily and Timothy,
this is your aunt, Martha.

220
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,833
Hi, you two.

221
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,420
You know these pajamas
look pretty familiar.

222
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,450
- You bought them for me on my birthday.

223
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,080
- And half the toys in this house.

224
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,610
- Remember this?

225
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,050
- Hmm, Christmas two years ago.

226
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,460
- My dad says I can catch real good now.

227
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,690
- Really?

228
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,523
They're beautiful.

229
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:48,395
- It's not exactly the
homecoming I had in mind.

230
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:49,228
(door opens)

231
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,431
- Daddy's home!
- Daddy!

232
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,590
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Daddy!

233
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,730
How's my babies, huh?

234
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,570
How's my big baby?

235
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,403
Mm.

236
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,093
- And this is Eddie.

237
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,550
How do you like him without his mustache?

238
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,710
- Well, well. (Eddie chuckles)

239
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,780
We sure have been looking
forward to this, haven't we?

240
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,040
Well, I tell you something,

241
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,340
your sister has been running
around, making me crazy.

242
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,710
Make me crazy, I keep
telling him to calm down,

243
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,310
your sister ain't expecting The Ritz.

244
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,593
She knows you got kids.

245
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,630
- Honey, things got really
messed up about picking her up.

246
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,130
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that.

247
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,460
Sorry about that.

248
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,240
I had to work overtime.

249
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,790
Had to pull a drive shaft
out of a cab last minute.

250
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:29,900
And then one thing and another and...

251
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,160
Can I get you a beer?

252
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,710
Anything?
- Oh, no.

253
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,543
No thanks.

254
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,420
- I sure could use one.
- Okay.

255
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,960
- Angels, time for bed.

256
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,483
Why don't you say
goodnight to Aunt Martha.

257
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,850
- Goodnight, kids.
- How 'bout your daddy, huh?

258
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,953
Come here, gimme a kiss.

259
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:49,438
I'll tuck you in later, alright?

260
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:50,271
Sleep good.

261
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,132
- Okay, bedtime.

262
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:54,299
Come on, come on, come on.

263
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,783
Hey babe, there should
be another fan out there.

264
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,133
Boy, never known the air to be so dead.

265
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,620
Come on, sit down.

266
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:17,863
Kid's stuff.

267
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:21,420
We're saving up for air conditioning.

268
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,260
Boy, these Texas summers are getting worse

269
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,310
or I'm getting older.

270
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,680
Kids don't seem to mind none though,

271
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,713
but I sure can't take it no more.

272
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:32,275
- [Linda] Here you go.

273
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:33,442
- Thanks baby.

274
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,763
- Honey something
terrible happened tonight.

275
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,173
Martha saw a man murdered.

276
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,360
Saw the killer's face and everything.

277
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,543
- Is that right?

278
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,840
- Well, I really didn't see him clearly.

279
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,740
- I thought you said you saw his face?

280
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,743
- Yes, but it was dark.

281
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,453
- Where?

282
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,097
Where'd you see this?

283
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,580
- I really don't know the town.

284
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,130
Somewhere by the train station.

285
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:11,750
- Did you call the police?

286
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,450
- Just about to, when you came in.

287
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,693
- I'll do it.

288
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:24,082
- Well I'll get your bags.

289
00:17:24,082 --> 00:17:27,982
And I'll show you to your room.

290
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:29,540
- [Man] No, go ahead, just unlatch it.

291
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,373
- [Man] Alright.

292
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,040
- [Man] We gonna have to
section this area off.

293
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,990
- Akins, what the hell are you doing here?

294
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,623
County seat's 40 miles away.

295
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,840
- Well I was out at the
lake, got this over the wire.

296
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,880
Daikin Larson?

297
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,473
- That's what the ID says.

298
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,653
- Name rang a bell.

299
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,403
Larson contacted my office a few days ago.

300
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,653
I was on vacation.

301
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,373
So he left a message.

302
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,640
- What kinda message?

303
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,767
- He was suspicious about
the death of a pal of his.

304
00:17:58,767 --> 00:17:59,600
- Pal huh?

305
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,480
Who would that be?

306
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,730
- Archie Maddox.

307
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,937
- [Man] No sir. Let 'em know...

308
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,130
- How long has our Larson been here?

309
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,220
- According to motel manager

310
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,370
he's been here less than a week.

311
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,070
- Mm hmm.
- Sheriff?

312
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,903
Eddie Pick called.

313
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:14,480
It seems there was a witness to this.

314
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,380
- Oh, good.

315
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,609
Mind if I tag along?

316
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,500
- (laughs) Now, I never
heard of a county prosecutor

317
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,260
just tagging along.

318
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,860
- Usually they want to take charge.

319
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,626
- Well, you know, you can
do all the questioning.

320
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:25,926
It's still a local matter.

321
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:28,401
- All right.

322
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:32,907
- Uh, I don't know how
many men, it was dark.

323
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,993
A man being beaten and running.

324
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,763
I heard a shot and then he fell.

325
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,233
That's all.

326
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:47,940
- Did you see the man who shot him?

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,090
- Well, like I said,

328
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,343
it was dark and he was wearing a mask.

329
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,690
- I guess I sort of saw
him when he came over

330
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,400
to look at the body.

331
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,213
- If he was wearing a mask,
how could you see his face?

332
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:07,025
- Well you said he took off the mask.

333
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,583
- Yes.

334
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,103
Yes he did.

335
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:16,418
He, he took off the mask.

336
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:17,583
- [Sheriff] But it was dark.

337
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,430
- Yes. Dark.

338
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,460
- [Sheriff] Anything else?

339
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,323
- No.
- Could you identify this man?

340
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,770
- I'm not sure.

341
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,123
- Well, thank you.

342
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,373
Thank you.

343
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:37,780
Good to see ya, Linda.

344
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,613
Eddie.

345
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,560
- That's it?

346
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,503
- Yeah. For now.

347
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,193
- All right.

348
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,271
For now then.

349
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:59,010
I wanna check out that motel room.

350
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,953
His personal stuff.
- Alright.

351
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:06,833
- You okay?

352
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,498
- Not really.

353
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:10,331
- Linda!

354
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,501
- Okay, I'll be right back.

355
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,501
(suspenseful music)

356
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,870
(tense music)

357
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,423
Hurry up and eat your breakfast.

358
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:08,237
- [Child] I don't want that.

359
00:21:08,237 --> 00:21:12,487
(voices muffling in the next room)

360
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,896
- It tastes like dirt.

361
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:19,370
- That's 'cause you keep
pounding it like dirt.

362
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,640
Now quit pounding it,
sit up straight and eat.

363
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,473
Don't play with it.

364
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:23,306
- [Martha] Good morning, everybody.

365
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:24,440
What's for breakfast?

366
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,273
- Morning.

367
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:27,390
- It's dirt.
- Oh. Mm.

368
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,430
- Oh yuck.
- Oh no, no, no.

369
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,560
Did you know that the lone ranger

370
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,770
never eats with his mask on?

371
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,020
- All right, come on kids.

372
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,160
You got school. Daddy's got work.

373
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,993
Let's go.

374
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,530
- You know what?
- What's that?

375
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,080
- A smiley face.
- A smiley face?

376
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,760
Oh, right in the middle is a?

377
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,661
- Nose.

378
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:50,328
(Martha laughs)

379
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,720
- You know the kids are wonderful, honey,

380
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,970
You did a great job.

381
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,203
- Yeah.

382
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:00,036
Eddie and I were gonna wait.

383
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:03,293
But, (mutters) we figured what the hell?

384
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,890
I love him, Martha.

385
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,723
- I can see that.

386
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,733
- He's not the most educated guy.

387
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:11,537
You know?

388
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:12,633
But he did okay.

389
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,830
I mean, he had a rough childhood,
a lot of abuse like us.

390
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,710
But he really got it together
and he loves the kids.

391
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,392
- How does he treat you?

392
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:23,233
- Mm, he loves me.

393
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,320
- You know, mom and dad
loved each other too,

394
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,190
but we know what that was like.

395
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,630
- Yeah well, that's not us.

396
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,140
I mean Eddie hardly ever drinks.

397
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,640
And he's never heavy handed
with Timothy or Emily.

398
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,513
- Or you?

399
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,820
- Well, only when I over cook the eggs

400
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,690
and then he bats me around a little bit.

401
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,742
- So don't cook eggs.

402
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,409
(both laughing)

403
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,800
You know, I'm, I'm really sorry

404
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,673
it was so rough with Dad at the end.

405
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,460
- It was always rough with Dad.

406
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,780
- You know I wanted to
come back for the funeral.

407
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,910
- No you didn't.

408
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:13,159
Well you didn't.

409
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,483
- Nope, I guess I didn't.

410
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,090
- Well, thanks for the checks.

411
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,040
I mean it covered everything we needed.

412
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,077
- Didn't cover what you needed.

413
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,077
- I managed.

414
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:36,193
I mean Eddie was there, thank
God, and he helped out a lot.

415
00:23:39,796 --> 00:23:41,983
But let's forget the past. Okay?

416
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,630
- [Man] What's the matter?

417
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,243
- There's a witness.
- A witness?

418
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,210
What do you mean a witness?

419
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,940
- Well, she didn't see much.

420
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,930
- She? Who's she?

421
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,330
- Name is Martha Dubius.

422
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,560
She's here visiting her sister.

423
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,393
- Well go on.

424
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:05,453
Who the hell's her sister?

425
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,643
- Linda Peck.

426
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,440
- Eddie's wife?

427
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,889
- He didn't tell you.

428
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:14,673
- (sighs) No wonder he's
been avoiding me all morning.

429
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,320
- You know, this whole
thing has gotten real messy.

430
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,380
First that Archie Maddox
situation was bad enough-

431
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,420
- That was an accident.

432
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,870
- And now the Larson killing.

433
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:27,567
A bullet in the back's no accident.

434
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,323
- Doyle, Sheriff.

435
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,950
- Counselor.
- Akins.

436
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,283
- Just to let you know,

437
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,400
I've requested a coroner's
inquest as soon as possible.

438
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,320
- Isn't that a little premature?

439
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,052
- Let's get in outta this killer heat.

440
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:00,635
(Doyle coughs)

441
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,740
You know, I've been
trying to sell this town

442
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,250
as a great place to live and do business.

443
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,410
(Doyle chuckles)

444
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,880
You couldn't make my job any
tougher if you put up a sign,

445
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,698
welcoming homeless hookers.

446
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:18,770
(Sheriff laughs)

447
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,419
- Well, whoever killed Larson did that

448
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,352
and I intend to find out
who killed him and why.

449
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:25,952
- What was he doing here anyway?

450
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,680
- Came to see an old friend.

451
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,640
- Yeah? Who's that?

452
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,483
- Archie Maddox.

453
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,970
- Archie Maddox? (laughs)

454
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,940
He was just a drunk who died in the fire

455
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,430
that he caused himself.

456
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,860
- What happened to his property?

457
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,724
- I bought it at public auction.

458
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:47,333
And I paid too damn much for it, too.

459
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,920
- You see the billboard
for the industrial park

460
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,860
outside of town?

461
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,200
- Archie's property.

462
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,800
- The whole town's gonna
benefit big time from that.

463
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,800
- It's funny how one man's life or death

464
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,783
could affect so many.

465
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,673
Whole economy of a town, in fact.

466
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,543
There's some poetry in there somewhere.

467
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:09,756
Thanks for the pop, Doyle.

468
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,322
(drill whirring)

469
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:21,652
(Martha gasps)

470
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:23,430
- Oo. (laughs)

471
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,400
Thought you might want
to join us for lunch.

472
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,107
- Next time could you please knock?

473
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:30,183
- Oh, I'm sorry, guess
I'm not used to guests.

474
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:33,534
(Eddie chuckles)

475
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,197
- [Linda] Eddie!

476
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:38,684
(Eddie growls playfully)

477
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:42,018
(car horn honks)

478
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:42,946
- Oo, amazing.

479
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:45,745
(slap cracks)

480
00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:48,207
(car horn honks)

481
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,150
- That's probably Mr. Potter.

482
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,413
He's Eddie's boss.

483
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,941
- [Eddie] What's up?

484
00:26:57,941 --> 00:26:58,774
- Get in.

485
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,221
What does she know?

486
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:05,320
- Oh didn't see nothin'.

487
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,750
She don't know nothin'.

488
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,293
- Akins thinks she does.

489
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,860
- Well he's shooting wild.

490
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,643
- You invite me to supper.

491
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,780
I'll find out what she knows.

492
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:22,487
- Mr. Potter has been
real good to his wife too.

493
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,573
I mean really gave us a break.

494
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,360
A little trouble and people run for cover,

495
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,350
but not the Potters.

496
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,750
- Well what kind of trouble?

497
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,517
- He's a great mechanic, like I said,

498
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,290
and Mr. Potter says that if he can-

499
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,790
- What kind of trouble, Linda?

500
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,363
- Eddie, knocked a guy
out and hit his windpipe.

501
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,950
They called it involuntary manslaughter

502
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,250
'cause it was an accident.

503
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,550
Hey, why don't you get dressed
and let's go into town.

504
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,237
I want to show you off, okay?

505
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,310
- Well, what is it like to
raise kids in a town like this?

506
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,650
- It's okay. I guess.

507
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,303
- And how are the schools?

508
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:04,280
- Mm, they're okay.

509
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,840
- Ever thought about private school?

510
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,113
- Martha, this isn't LA.

511
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,380
And besides, Eddie and I can't afford it.

512
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,320
- Well, I could.

513
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,383
- No, you couldn't.

514
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,460
I mean, it's sweet of you,
but since Eddie had it rough,

515
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,293
I mean...

516
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:20,900
Hi, Walt.
- Howdy, Linda.

517
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,210
- He just doesn't want the kids to think

518
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,523
that anything comes easy.

519
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,210
You know?

520
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,630
- You know that trouble
you said Eddie was in?

521
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,660
- Mm hmm.

522
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,763
- Did he ever hit you?

523
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,140
Dammit, Martha, why don't you like Eddie?

524
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,623
I mean, from the moment
you met him, I sensed it.

525
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,038
What, what is it about him?

526
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:41,620
I mean it's something.

527
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,140
And when he talks to you,
you barely speak to him.

528
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,360
It's not right. It's embarrassing.

529
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,160
- Can we just drop this right now?

530
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,290
- No, I will not drop it.

531
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,420
I mean, it's been 15 years
since we've seen each other

532
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,010
and we're all walking on eggshells.

533
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,093
It's not right.

534
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,410
Eddie walks in a room and you walk out

535
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,530
or you shut your door.

536
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,420
- I can't.

537
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,853
I can't talk about this now.

538
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,340
- Well what, are you gonna
wait another 15 years?

539
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,420
We're sisters and we used to be close.

540
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,700
But the longer you're here
the more distant you become.

541
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,773
It's not fair.

542
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,603
Martha, please talk to me.

543
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:18,301
(Martha sighs)

544
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:22,133
(gentle, yet tense music)

545
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:22,966
- Oh.

546
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,543
Eddie was the one I saw
kill that man, Larson.

547
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:35,630
- No.

548
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,110
No, how can you say that?

549
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,793
- I was there. I saw him do it.

550
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:42,020
- No.

551
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:43,830
- [Martha] Linda!

552
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,853
Linda please.

553
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:57,911
- Everything all right, Ms. Dubius?

554
00:29:57,911 --> 00:29:58,744
- Yeah.

555
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,530
My sister and I haven't seen
each other in so many years.

556
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,430
We have a lot of
unfinished family business.

557
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,070
- Well, we were just
coming by to pick you up.

558
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,903
- Why?

559
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:13,190
- Need to ask you a few questions

560
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,913
about what you saw last night.

561
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,223
- Well, I told you everything that I saw.

562
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,760
I was here behind these crates.

563
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,050
And Larson was here.

564
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,733
and this, this is where
you saw the assailant?

565
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:37,750
- Well, his head was sort of half in

566
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,050
and half out of the light.

567
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,020
- Well I'm standing over the body

568
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,260
and I would be fully lit by that light.

569
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,810
How could you not see his face?

570
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,730
- I guess he was looking down.

571
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,850
- Larson was killed
what, about 10 past nine?

572
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,683
- That's right.

573
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:02,900
Gah, it's funny nobody saw anything.

574
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,390
Restaurant across the street
and there's a bar right here.

575
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,963
- [Martha] Everything was closed.

576
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,670
- Everything was closed.

577
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,560
But yesterday when Larson
was killed, wasn't a holiday.

578
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,120
Was it?

579
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,280
- When there's no business,
sometimes stores closed early.

580
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,113
- Uh huh.

581
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,900
All of them, including the bar?

582
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,910
- Maybe you should ask them

583
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,690
why they shut down early last night, hmm?

584
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,990
- Well, you can bet on it.

585
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,923
Come on, Ms. Dubius, I'll take you home.

586
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,319
(suspenseful music)

587
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,140
- I'm sorry I wasn't much help.

588
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,870
- Well, I got a feeling that
it'll all be a lot clearer

589
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,853
in a few days.

590
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,800
- What do you mean by that?

591
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,150
- When the shock wears off.

592
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:52,928
- Oh.

593
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:09,329
(thoughtful music)

594
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,420
- Thanks for your help.

595
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,520
Sorry it took so long.

596
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,470
- You told Sheriff Brand

597
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,390
and that prosecutor something, didn't you?

598
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,687
- No, I didn't.

599
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,790
- I know you think you
saw Eddie kill that man,

600
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,360
but you're wrong, Martha.

601
00:32:51,743 --> 00:32:55,760
You know, I saw this program
about how much we really see.

602
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,090
And if we really remember the
things that we think we saw

603
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,490
and they had these
people look at something

604
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,323
and then close their eyes

605
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:02,723
and then describe what
they saw in a minute,

606
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:03,910
they didn't even get the colors right.

607
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,470
It was really crazy.

608
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,353
So what I'm trying to
say is it wasn't Eddie.

609
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,860
I mean, it may have looked like him,

610
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,130
but it was somebody else.

611
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:11,970
He didn't do it.

612
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,473
You were mistaken, Martha.

613
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,630
- I should never have told you like that.

614
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,193
I'm gonna pack up and go in the morning.

615
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,663
- Oh that's just great.

616
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:26,090
You accuse my husband of
murder and then you just leave.

617
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,490
- I don't want to leave you.

618
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,773
But if I stay, I can't help.

619
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,700
And if they keep pressuring me,

620
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,117
I'm gonna have to tell them what I saw.

621
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:38,000
- And I want you to admit you
could have made a mistake.

622
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,943
- I can't, Linda.

623
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,983
- I saw that man killed
and I saw Eddie do it.

624
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:52,131
(sad music)

625
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,825
- I've waited for years for this.

626
00:33:58,825 --> 00:34:00,463
For you coming here.

627
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:01,463
- Oh I know.

628
00:34:02,337 --> 00:34:03,170
I know.

629
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,030
- And I'm just afraid if you leave

630
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,633
I'll never see you again.

631
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,540
- So you'll call me when you get to LA?

632
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,000
- Yeah, maybe when things cool
down, you can come see me.

633
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,833
Bring the kids.

634
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:46,201
- Sure.

635
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,589
- [Man On PA] Hardy to track two.

636
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:49,756
Amtrak silver.

637
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:54,547
- Well, man says the train's on time.

638
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:58,469
- [Man On PA] Taylor, Waco, Waxahachie.

639
00:34:58,469 --> 00:34:59,302
- Oh no.

640
00:35:04,497 --> 00:35:07,500
- Sorry to do this to you, Ms. Dubius,

641
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,774
- You don't look sorry.

642
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:09,607
- What is it?

643
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,103
- Subpoena. Coroner's inquest.

644
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,480
- But you didn't see anything.

645
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,960
I mean, you told them that it was dark.

646
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,400
I heard you, you told them both.

647
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,233
I heard you!

648
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,500
- Eddie!
- I just don't get it.

649
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,480
- It's a subpoena.

650
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,340
It's not as if I asked to testify.

651
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,560
It's a court order.

652
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,840
You've heard of a court order?

653
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,510
Honey, go get her bag.

654
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,343
Please.

655
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,120
- I'll get a rental car and a room.

656
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,283
- No, you can't.

657
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,740
- I can't stay with him in the house.

658
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,590
- Please. For me.

659
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:51,073
(thoughtful music)

660
00:35:51,073 --> 00:35:51,906
- Okay.

661
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:58,689
(ominous music)

662
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,180
Don't you think it would
be better all around

663
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,800
if I just got a room someplace?

664
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,723
- No, Martha, I need you to stay here.

665
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,450
- Why are you so frantic?

666
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,570
I mean, what are you afraid of?

667
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,830
- It's just this town.

668
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,600
I mean, if you move
out, there'll be gossip.

669
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,870
And if it gets back to Eddie-

670
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,120
- Eddie, it's always Eddie!

671
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,930
Why does everything revolve around Eddie?

672
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,630
Do you ever put yourself first?

673
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,750
Yes, it's what I want too,
I want you to stay here too.

674
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,583
- Now honey, honey listen,

675
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:31,960
it's gonna be okay.

676
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,560
Okay?

677
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,460
- What's going on?

678
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:39,192
- Hey honey.

679
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,050
I got a great meal plan for the Potters.

680
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,883
- Yeah baby.

681
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:47,013
What's the matter?

682
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,883
- I just heard some talk around a town.

683
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,850
Seems you got a lot of people worried.

684
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,980
- How so?

685
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,210
- Well, bad time for
this would be happening.

686
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,920
We got a lot riding on
Rocky Valley being seen

687
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,120
as a law and order town.

688
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,740
- Compared to Beirut, probably is.

689
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,935
- Big aluminum siding plant

690
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,235
deciding between Rocky
Valley and Temple City.

691
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:14,432
- Before you let Akin start scaring you,

692
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,050
when the prosecutor
gets himself a witness,

693
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,250
sometimes he tries to make you

694
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,940
start seeing all sorts of things.

695
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,930
- You being an authority on prosecutors?

696
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,030
- Don't get cute.

697
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,863
Say what you mean.

698
00:37:23,863 --> 00:37:24,720
- No, thanks.

699
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,280
I've seen how you fly off the handle

700
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,510
when people say what they mean.

701
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,450
- No need to, 'til you came
along, that's for sure.

702
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,530
(Martha scoffs)

703
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,130
Listen.
- Stop it, Eddie!

704
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,203
Let go of her.

705
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,600
- You touch me again and
I'll tell them what I know.

706
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,433
- Really?

707
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,150
What do you know?

708
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,703
- I know that you shot that man Larson.

709
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,623
I saw you shoot him.

710
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:54,350
And the other man call you an idiot,

711
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,200
which is just about the nicest
thing I can say about you.

712
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
- She tell you this?

713
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,653
She tell you this lie?

714
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:07,580
- Yes.
- Well why didn't you tell me?

715
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,413
Why didn't you tell me?

716
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,400
- Because maybe every
time you raise your fence-

717
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,777
- You stay out of it.

718
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:17,313
- Please, Martha.

719
00:38:17,313 --> 00:38:18,550
Ever since you come here

720
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,980
you've been looking down your nose at us.

721
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,350
And that's because you hate me

722
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,730
for not providing a smart life
for your sister like you got.

723
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,983
- Stop turning yourself into the victim.

724
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,170
- Look at her, honey.

725
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,230
How many times has she changed her story?

726
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,973
Huh? How many times.

727
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,424
Now how much could she have seen?

728
00:38:37,424 --> 00:38:38,510
You know how dark those streets are

729
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,160
when all those stores are closed.

730
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,993
- I never said the stores were closed.

731
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,030
- It's a small town. People talk.

732
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,353
Everybody knows that.

733
00:38:54,036 --> 00:38:55,510
Look at her.

734
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,710
Look at her.

735
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,210
Standing there, all smug
and sure of herself.

736
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,513
She don't know squat,

737
00:39:01,614 --> 00:39:04,830
but she's got to convince you
that you can do better than me

738
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,760
because she hates it that you got a family

739
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,330
and all she's got is an empty bed.

740
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,163
You want to believe her, honey?

741
00:39:10,163 --> 00:39:11,743
You just go ahead and believe her.

742
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:13,836
I don't even give a damn.

743
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,563
- Eddie!

744
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:20,326
Eddie!

745
00:39:21,922 --> 00:39:23,820
Eddie, wait!

746
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,384
Look at me. Look at me.

747
00:39:26,384 --> 00:39:27,467
Just tell me.

748
00:39:28,537 --> 00:39:30,220
I'm your wife.

749
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,240
And whatever it is,
we'll piece it together.

750
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,710
But you have to tell me the truth.

751
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,820
Did you do what she said?

752
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,970
Did you kill that, man?

753
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,290
- She's lying, Linda, alright?

754
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,220
She's lying.

755
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,309
I didn't do it, I wasn't even there.

756
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:44,226
(thoughtful music)

757
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:51,436
You gotta believe me.

758
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:52,367
I don't know why she's doing this,

759
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,200
I don't know why she's doing this.

760
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,480
I don't know why.

761
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,660
- What we've got here is a
county prosecutor with an agenda.

762
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,770
While he's building
himself up in the press,

763
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,130
with all kinds of wild theories,

764
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,330
they're writing bad things about us

765
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,830
and the investors are leaving.

766
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,510
He's like all these politicians,

767
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,760
he's gotta build himself
up with headlines.

768
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,877
- Well, he's running out of time.

769
00:40:15,877 --> 00:40:17,193
The inquest is tomorrow.

770
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,970
- I never know if this size
helps, but I do it anyway.

771
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,270
I think probably, you know,

772
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,650
ceiling fans do the most good.

773
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,483
- Well, we're saving up
for air conditioning.

774
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,123
Hey, kids are back.

775
00:40:31,123 --> 00:40:32,373
- [Eddie] Good.

776
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:35,685
- Hey! Hi sweeties.
- Hey, kids.

777
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:37,288
- Hey, look who's here!

778
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:38,637
Look who's here.

779
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:39,750
Oh boy.

780
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,545
That's a great cap. Who won?

781
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:42,378
- We won.

782
00:40:42,378 --> 00:40:44,460
- Oh good! Come here, you pretty thing.

783
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,750
- Do you have any children
of your own, Mrs. Potter?

784
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,070
- Not this small.

785
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,273
- What about Tina?

786
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,410
- Oh, well Tina wasn't mine, honey.

787
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,713
- Where is she now?

788
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,093
- With the angels, Emily.

789
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,950
Tina's with the angels.

790
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,270
- Hey, why don't we let the grownups

791
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,056
finish their dinner, all right?

792
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:04,889
Okay.

793
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:07,383
- What wonderful children.

794
00:41:09,194 --> 00:41:11,777
(Doyle laughs)

795
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:17,300
- I understand you work
for a department store.

796
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,820
- Actually I'm a buyer for a
chain of department stores.

797
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,830
- I think women should work.

798
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,290
They get in so much trouble

799
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,323
with too much time on their hands.

800
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,560
- As opposed to men who
get into a lot of trouble

801
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,497
with so little time on their hands.

802
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:39,580
(Mrs. Potter laughs)

803
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,920
- You know, I always wanted to work,

804
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,753
have a career.

805
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,530
- Well you raised a family, didn't you?

806
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,363
- One son.

807
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,893
Actually...Eddie has
been more of a son to me

808
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:53,680
than that loser.

809
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,880
- Thank you, Mr. Potter.

810
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,563
- Our son went his own way.

811
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,303
- Thanks to your encouragement.

812
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,490
- I've always been grateful to our mother

813
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,513
for encouraging me to go my own way.

814
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,730
Some birds when they fly from the nest

815
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,780
don't land quite as good as you did.

816
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,810
- It's not the landing
that counts Mr. Potter.

817
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,460
It's the flying.

818
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,910
- What's that supposed to mean?

819
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,260
- That having the courage
to try to do something

820
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,263
is what's important.

821
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,670
Not how successful you become.

822
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:28,670
- (coughs) It's airy fairy crap like that

823
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,230
that losers tell each other

824
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,432
to keep 'em from getting discouraged.

825
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:34,840
(Doyle coughs)

826
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,550
- Oh, Linda, I'm so sorry.

827
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,966
- It's okay.

828
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:39,799
Here.

829
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:41,599
- [Eddie] Here, put that over there.

830
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,730
- [Linda] Thank you. (chuckles)

831
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,563
- Up.

832
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,805
- [Eddie] Watch your elbow
now, sweetheart, alright?

833
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:49,904
- Yeah, y'all be careful.
- Whoever fixed the chain

834
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:52,479
on this thing, I think one
side's longer than the other.

835
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:53,970
- [Linda] Yeah, kinda tween.

836
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,000
- Honey listen.

837
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,690
The man had a husky voice
and he used an inhaler.

838
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,350
How many men in this town does that fit?

839
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,380
- What are you doing?

840
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,140
You're not content in
destroying one family,

841
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,340
but you want to bust
up the Potters as well?

842
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:09,924
(Martha sighs)

843
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:21,350
- I just came in for a glass of water.

844
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,218
- Oh, Mr. Potter, it,
it's in the refrigerator.

845
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:25,568
- Oh, now I'll help myself.

846
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,270
- It's really nice having
you and Mrs. Potter here.

847
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,090
- Yeah, well we're really enjoying it.

848
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,960
You know, we don't get out very often.

849
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,463
Hilda is in rather delicate health.

850
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,870
You know I wouldn't trade Rocky Valley

851
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,060
for all the cities in the world.

852
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,130
- Oh, me either.

853
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:52,963
Eddie and I-

854
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,460
- Small town people know how
to pull together in a crisis.

855
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,540
You remember when the shops closed

856
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,419
during that oil glut?

857
00:44:00,419 --> 00:44:02,050
- Oh yeah, and the food drive.

858
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,380
- Eddie had several strikes against him.

859
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,900
I hate to think what would
have happened to Eddie

860
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,200
if it hadn't been for you.

861
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,820
Without all of us for that matter.

862
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:16,880
You know, there's something
about a small town,

863
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,830
a kind of loyalty that
people in big cities

864
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,363
just don't understand.

865
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:28,630
But there's a price for
that fierce loyalty.

866
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,713
Betrayal is very ugly.

867
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,850
In a city if you betray your neighbor

868
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:40,193
you can always move to another suburb.

869
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,373
Sort of reinvent yourself.

870
00:44:44,608 --> 00:44:45,960
But in a small town

871
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:49,511
you have to live with people you betrayed.

872
00:44:54,647 --> 00:44:56,290
(Doyle sighs)

873
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,340
Thanks for the water.

874
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:07,003
- Now we know it was dark, Ms. Dubius.

875
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,710
Every shop in the area that night

876
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:13,213
for some inexplicable reason
had decided to shut early.

877
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,690
Innuendo is inappropriate

878
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,880
and suspicions are not
evidence, Counselor.

879
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,660
Those shop owners have testified.

880
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,800
Nothing inexplicably about closing early

881
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,930
when there's no business.

882
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,777
- Or why there was no
cab at the train station.

883
00:45:25,777 --> 00:45:27,977
- That's your second
warning, Mr. Akins, Mr.

884
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,930
- Mr. Potter has already
submitted an affidavit

885
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,710
of repair on one cab.

886
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,440
And Mr. Ballou, the
driver of the second cab

887
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,357
had proof he was in Dallas that night.

888
00:45:36,357 --> 00:45:37,773
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

889
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,210
Coincidence is like common sense.

890
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:44,250
It's very uncommon.

891
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,530
I get suspicious when
a whole town shuts down

892
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,260
so that a man can get killed.

893
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,600
- Mr. Akins, unlike common sense.

894
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,520
Conspiracy theories are very common.

895
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,590
You're too smart to introduce
suspicions as evidence.

896
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,280
This is an inquest, not a trial.

897
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,791
Don't audition for us, you got the job.

898
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:03,769
(courtroom chuckles)

899
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:06,810
(gavel pounds)

900
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:09,460
- Alright. Alright.

901
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,460
So just what did you see Ms. Dubius?

902
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,893
- It was dark.

903
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,390
I didn't see anyone clearly.

904
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,970
- Larson fell right in front of you

905
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,930
under a street lamp.

906
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:29,060
The assailants crowded around
him, removed their masks.

907
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,100
And you didn't see them?

908
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,630
- Only one removed his mask.

909
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,130
- The one who was shot Larson.

910
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,260
He was the one under the light.

911
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,883
- He kept his head down.

912
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,660
I'm sorry, I didn't see
any of them clearly.

913
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,990
- So you can't identify him?

914
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,823
- No.

915
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,960
I'm afraid. I can't.

916
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,877
(unsettling music)

917
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,730
(upbeat music)
(crowd murmuring)

918
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:11,475
- Excuse me.

919
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:12,666
Excuse me. Can I get through?

920
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,110
Excuse me. Excuse me.

921
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,183
Beg your pardon.

922
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,483
Excuse me.

923
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:22,808
Hello, ladies.

924
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:24,290
- I hope this isn't
going to be unpleasant.

925
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,880
- No more unpleasant than
it was for me in there.

926
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,570
- It's over. Let us get on with our lives.

927
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,580
- Murdered by assailants
or assailants unknown

928
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,283
is not what I call satisfactory verdict.

929
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,240
Tomorrow I'm gonna serve
you another subpoena.

930
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,220
- She told you everything.

931
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,210
- I can speak for myself-

932
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,560
- You got no right hounding her like that.

933
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,433
- Eddie, please!

934
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:50,790
- Eddie!
- I told you what I saw.

935
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:53,705
- Well, you can tell me again
in front of a grand jury.

936
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:56,310
- (scoffs) I have a job
I have to get back to.

937
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,320
- Just remember Ms. Dubius,

938
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,943
that perjury is a serious
offense in a murder trial.

939
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:04,690
- If I'm not sure what I
saw, is it still perjury?

940
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,010
- No, but it is if you are sure

941
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,710
and just scared to tell the truth.

942
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,460
- He didn't believe you.

943
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,233
He didn't believe you.

944
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,500
- It's not her fault, Eddie.

945
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,010
It's not her fault.
- Come on. Let's go.

946
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,690
Get in the car.

947
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:28,690
- I'll walk, thanks.

948
00:48:31,406 --> 00:48:33,073
- Come on, let's go.

949
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:35,939
Something else happens.

950
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,419
(tires peeling)

951
00:48:48,419 --> 00:48:51,252
(chainsaw buzzes)

952
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,803
- Where's Linda?

953
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,653
- I don't know.

954
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,180
Maybe she's got a boyfriend.

955
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,930
- Gee, that'd sure top my wishlist.

956
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,876
(unsettling music)

957
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,640
- Your sister's at work.

958
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,200
Kids are at dinner with friends.

959
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,033
(chuckles)

960
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:42,520
Had you going there, didn't I?

961
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,820
Boy, I'll tell ya,

962
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,820
sure is hot.

963
00:49:52,203 --> 00:49:54,103
I wish I could afford a swimming pool.

964
00:49:58,608 --> 00:50:01,108
I bet you got a swimming pool.

965
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,345
You ever skinny dip?

966
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:09,012
(Martha scoffs)

967
00:50:12,908 --> 00:50:13,741
- Are you afraid?

968
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:15,220
- Get out of here.

969
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,430
- Why do I know what you're
gonna say before you say it?

970
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:20,863
- I don't know. You tell me.

971
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,083
- Look at you.

972
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,410
Struttin' around like the town stud.

973
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,382
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

974
00:50:29,382 --> 00:50:31,070
- (laughs) You oughta be
grateful for the attention.

975
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,270
- Don't flatter yourself.

976
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,888
- Problem with you as you
never had a real man before.

977
00:50:34,888 --> 00:50:36,558
(Martha gasps)

978
00:50:36,558 --> 00:50:37,391
- Stop.

979
00:50:40,864 --> 00:50:41,781
Stop! Stop!

980
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,370
Are you crazy?

981
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,311
Ow!

982
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:48,400
- Eddie! Eddie, what?

983
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,233
Eddie!

984
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:51,880
- Sorry.

985
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,780
Honey, I'm sor-

986
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,280
(slap cracks)

987
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,410
She come on to me.
- You stupid liar.

988
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,160
- She knew you's gonna
catch us here, honey.

989
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,209
She knew you was gonna come home

990
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:03,430
and that you was gonna catch us like this.

991
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,446
She set me up.

992
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:06,480
- You don't think she's
gonna buy any of that crap.

993
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,380
- Martha, stop it.

994
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,513
- You don't believe him?

995
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:11,500
- She's all talk, baby.

996
00:51:13,187 --> 00:51:14,460
But talk ain't facts.

997
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,560
Fact is you know what we got.

998
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,023
You know, because you
can feel it right here.

999
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,670
- Eddie, leave us.

1000
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,103
Please leave us alone.

1001
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,480
- You don't believe him?

1002
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,160
- I don't know what to believe.

1003
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,140
- Oh, Linda.

1004
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,140
- I just know that until you came here,

1005
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,400
I was happy for the first time in my life.

1006
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,350
- You blame me?

1007
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,577
- I'm just telling you

1008
00:51:56,577 --> 00:51:58,670
I'm not gonna throw away what I have.

1009
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,210
I may never find it again.

1010
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:01,503
And I end up like you.

1011
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,250
You're right, it's not
good with all of us here

1012
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,100
under one roof.

1013
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,349
There's a nice motel in town.

1014
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:15,099
I'll call 'em for ya.

1015
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:26,908
(thoughtful music)

1016
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:43,290
- Hey, this is a great
spot for our picnic.

1017
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,890
You guys go out and get
all set up, alright?

1018
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,080
I'm gonna make a call and
then I'll come right out

1019
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,540
and be with ya, alright?

1020
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,820
Okay. Can you carry that?

1021
00:52:54,934 --> 00:52:55,810
You got that?

1022
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:56,643
Good, sweetie.

1023
00:52:56,643 --> 00:52:57,520
Just go right in there.

1024
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,070
See if you can pick out a spot.

1025
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,320
Thanks, Emily.

1026
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,700
Hello? Hi.

1027
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,320
Yeah, Jane?

1028
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,153
Hi, it's Martha.

1029
00:53:05,153 --> 00:53:06,720
Could I speak to Morgan?

1030
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,553
Thanks.

1031
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,630
Hi Morgan.

1032
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,790
I'm gonna be here another couple of weeks.

1033
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,560
I've been subpoenaed.

1034
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,610
I know, but I'll talk to you soon.

1035
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,443
Okay, bye.

1036
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:25,985
Okay guys, let's get all
this stuff packed up.

1037
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,680
- [Timothy] Boy, that was great.

1038
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,560
Why aren't you living with us anymore?

1039
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,710
- Oh sweetie, you know,

1040
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,560
I just thought maybe it was
getting a little crowded.

1041
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,503
- [Emily] We wish you'd come back.

1042
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,100
- [Timothy] We like you living with us.

1043
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,130
- You know what guys you're making me

1044
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,460
feel really, really good.

1045
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,932
Here you go, can you carry that?

1046
00:53:52,932 --> 00:53:54,349
- Yes.
- Alright.

1047
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,370
- That's where me and Dad go shooting.

1048
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:58,820
- [Martha] What do you shoot at?

1049
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,930
- Just cans and stuff,
but Archie made us stop.

1050
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,080
- Archie Maddox?

1051
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,650
Is that his property?

1052
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,610
- Yeah, he's real mean
whenever Tina was there.

1053
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,443
- Tina?

1054
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,420
- A little girl who would
come to visit Archie.

1055
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,780
She acted real funny.

1056
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,630
She looked weird too.

1057
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,743
- Archie Maddox.
(phone rings)

1058
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:21,743
(suspenseful music)

1059
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:25,397
- I get to answer it.
- No, me.

1060
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:28,000
(tense music)

1061
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,788
- Kids? Timothy!

1062
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:30,621
No!

1063
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:33,314
Timothy!
(rattling)

1064
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:35,647
(screaming)

1065
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,390
- Texas. Snakes are everywhere.

1066
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,470
- Well what about that four wheeler

1067
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,430
that I saw stop next to my car?

1068
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,380
- Mm hmm. Did you get a license number?

1069
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,460
- Whoever killed Larson wants me dead too.

1070
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,147
- If they killed Larson because
he suspected Archie's death

1071
00:54:53,147 --> 00:54:55,450
and the fire wasn't
accidental, then you're right.

1072
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,313
They won't hesitate to kill you too.

1073
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,570
Of course, if you didn't see anything

1074
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,660
why would anyone want to kill you?

1075
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,410
- Maybe it's what they think I saw.

1076
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,410
- Okay. Okay.

1077
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,903
I'll attach deputy to watch you.

1078
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:11,890
- No, then they'll be
sure I know something.

1079
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,940
- You won't let me help you?

1080
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,023
My hands are tied.

1081
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,617
- Well, you don't have any
answers at all, do you?

1082
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:19,570
- That's right, I don't have any answers.

1083
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,440
I may just have to subpoena
this whole damn town.

1084
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,450
- I'm not gonna hang around
here waiting to be killed

1085
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,520
while you fill out subpoenas.

1086
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,950
- Now, what does that mean?

1087
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,940
- Well if I'm stuck here,
I'm gonna make it pay off.

1088
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,197
- Now hold on, hold on. Just wait.

1089
00:55:32,197 --> 00:55:33,970
No use start sticking your nose.

1090
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:36,646
Oh, oh boy.

1091
00:55:36,646 --> 00:55:39,646
(suspenseful music)

1092
00:56:00,768 --> 00:56:03,300
- Well who's she talking to now?

1093
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,800
Uh huh.

1094
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,573
What kinda questions is she asking?

1095
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,133
Okay, well keep me informed.

1096
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:11,953
Eddie, get in here.

1097
00:56:22,965 --> 00:56:23,798
- Doyle?

1098
00:56:25,558 --> 00:56:28,460
- That sister-in-law of
yours is asking questions.

1099
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,750
Questions about Archie's land.

1100
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,740
About how strange it is that
I'm the only builder in town

1101
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,770
who owns Archie's land.

1102
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,093
- She's just making a pest
of herself, that's all.

1103
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:40,020
I mean, ain't gonna do her no good.

1104
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,370
- She's also asking (coughs)

1105
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,040
about a little girl visiting Archie.

1106
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,900
How do you suppose she put
together Tina with Archie?

1107
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,100
You answer me that, huh?

1108
00:56:50,008 --> 00:56:51,258
- I don't know.

1109
00:56:56,289 --> 00:56:58,597
(suspenseful music)

1110
00:56:58,597 --> 00:57:00,310
(Martha gasps)

1111
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,600
- Hotter than a whore's breath in here.

1112
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,530
- Take your rustic homilies and get out

1113
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,700
or I'll call the police.

1114
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,450
Better yet, I'll call the FBI.

1115
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,550
It's a federal offense
to intimidate a witness.

1116
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:12,163
- You sit down and shut the hell up.

1117
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:17,400
Just who do you think
you are coming in here,

1118
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,523
messing around in our
business, disrupting our lives.

1119
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,660
If you want to know
anything about Archie Maddox

1120
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,380
or about who owns his land

1121
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,433
you come to me.

1122
00:57:29,433 --> 00:57:30,850
You understand that?

1123
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:33,040
- What about that snake,

1124
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,450
was that supposed to scare me outta town?

1125
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,800
Don't you get it?

1126
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,870
If I try to leave town,
they'll throw me in jail.

1127
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,393
I've been subpoenaed. I am stuck here.

1128
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,033
- If you stay, you might
want to think about

1129
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,123
what this town has done for
your sister and her family.

1130
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,463
We don't like inquisitive
strangers coming in here.

1131
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,027
You might want to think about that

1132
00:57:59,027 --> 00:58:01,133
before you testify again.

1133
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:09,340
(door slams)

1134
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,810
- Well, what brings you here?

1135
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:23,930
- I just got a visit from Doyle Potter.

1136
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:27,193
I'm not about to let some
redneck bully intimidate me.

1137
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,153
- Feel better?

1138
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,320
- Eddie was the one who shot Larson.

1139
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,480
Potter was there too.

1140
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,313
- What?

1141
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,500
Oh, I didn't see his face,

1142
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,430
but I recognized his voice
and he used an inhaler.

1143
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,260
- You're sure.
- Yes. I'm sure.

1144
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,650
Will that be enough to convict him?

1145
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,690
- Well that's not your worry.

1146
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:46,660
Besides, that's down the line.

1147
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,130
First, the arraignment, then
the indictment against Eddie.

1148
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,010
He'll pull the rest down.

1149
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,630
- A favor.
- What?

1150
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,590
- I need time to convince
Linda to leave Eddie.

1151
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:55,740
- Can't promise that.

1152
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,820
When Linda and the kids
are out of that house,

1153
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,100
then you can have him.

1154
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,593
Otherwise forget it.

1155
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,903
- 48 hours.

1156
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:08,874
Unbelievable.

1157
00:59:10,419 --> 00:59:12,172
- Look, there's something else.

1158
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:14,489
- - What?
- Came from Linda's kids.

1159
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:16,210
They used to play near
Archie Maddox's house.

1160
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,480
- Yeah, the guy Larson came to see.

1161
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,200
- Yeah, and Archie would chase 'em away

1162
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,400
whenever a little girl came to visit.

1163
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,350
- A little girl, who was she?

1164
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,670
- Her name was Tina.

1165
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,480
- When was this?
- About a year ago.

1166
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,480
Hilda Potter used to
bring her to visit Archie.

1167
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,030
And there's another thing.
- What?

1168
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,503
- The kids said there was
something strange about her.

1169
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:33,302
- What do you mean, strange?

1170
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:35,052
I don't know. That's all they said.

1171
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,782
(ominous tones)

1172
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:19,666
(door rattling)

1173
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:41,494
(door creaks)

1174
01:00:41,494 --> 01:00:42,327
Linda?

1175
01:00:42,327 --> 01:00:44,994
(ominous tones)

1176
01:00:49,943 --> 01:00:50,776
Linda?

1177
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:14,077
Linda?

1178
01:01:18,056 --> 01:01:19,142
(electricity buzzes)

1179
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,642
(Linda gasps)

1180
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,050
- [Linda] Scared me to death.

1181
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:30,883
- Me too.

1182
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:33,160
- I just came into get a cup of coffee.

1183
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:33,993
I'm doing books.

1184
01:01:33,993 --> 01:01:35,030
What are you doing here?

1185
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,163
- Well, I think we should talk.

1186
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,720
- [Linda] Would you like a cup of coffee?

1187
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,073
- Oh, no thanks.

1188
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,368
I'd like you and the kids
to come to LA for awhile.

1189
01:01:55,368 --> 01:01:58,440
- (scoffs) We can't do that.

1190
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,273
I've got a job.

1191
01:01:59,273 --> 01:02:01,000
The kids are in school.

1192
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,400
I can't-
- Just for a little while.

1193
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,370
I mean, say you're taking a vacation.

1194
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,560
Parents take their kids
outta school all the time.

1195
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,560
They can make it up.

1196
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:12,500
- And what about Eddie?

1197
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,783
- This is not about Eddie.

1198
01:02:17,335 --> 01:02:19,330
(Linda sighs)

1199
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:20,163
I'm sorry.

1200
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,943
- What is this really about?

1201
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,410
- It's about taking a break, you know,

1202
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,660
from all that's happened.

1203
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,810
Come on, you see the way Eddie's acting.

1204
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,420
It's not good for you and
it's not good for the kids.

1205
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,930
You know guys like Dad and Eddie,

1206
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:42,460
well, they never think
of the consequences.

1207
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,483
They're children and they're dangerous.

1208
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,755
And they'll never grow up
because of people like...

1209
01:02:49,755 --> 01:02:52,255
(tense music)

1210
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:53,923
Mother.

1211
01:02:57,131 --> 01:02:57,964
- And me.

1212
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:02,463
Mother and me, that's
what you were gonna say.

1213
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,190
You want us to leave town

1214
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,500
'cause you're gonna testify against Eddie.

1215
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,333
- Linda, honey.

1216
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:12,090
Listen, it's time to think
about you and the kids.

1217
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,510
- You are destroying my life, Martha.

1218
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,190
Do you realize that's what you're doing?

1219
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:18,100
I'll never forgive you, never.

1220
01:03:26,757 --> 01:03:31,757
(pool balls clattering)
(Linda gasps)

1221
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,760
(ominous tones)

1222
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,010
- Are you okay?

1223
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:41,376
(Linda sobs)

1224
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,932
Come on, I'll get us a beer.

1225
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,410
- Thanks for coming.

1226
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,750
I just didn't want to be alone.

1227
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,900
- Your sister?
- Yeah.

1228
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,320
- Come on.

1229
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,350
I got some good news.

1230
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,980
I've been doing some checking.

1231
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,440
Archie Maddox did indeed
have a daughter named Tina.

1232
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,983
Only the Hall of Records
claiming she died 10 years ago.

1233
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,410
- But the kids said they
just saw her a year a go.

1234
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:25,150
- Yeah, well, if that's true,

1235
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,803
then obviously someone
fake the death certificate.

1236
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,420
- Did Archie have any other relatives

1237
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,790
who could have inherited his land?

1238
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,290
- Nope, I checked.

1239
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,930
And with Tina legally
dead, Potter was able

1240
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:43,300
to buy Archie's land in a public auction

1241
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,220
and he got it cheap.

1242
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,053
- What about Tina?

1243
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:48,870
- Well Mr. Potter's not gonna tell us.

1244
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,150
- So I guess that means

1245
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,554
we're on our way to see Hilda Potter.

1246
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:53,387
- Mm hmm.

1247
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,693
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1248
01:05:24,189 --> 01:05:27,653
- I always add extra water,
it gets too sweet for me.

1249
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:35,163
Whew, I can't bear this heat.

1250
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,810
I can't imagine how you
think I can help you.

1251
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:45,570
- Oh, you understand this is unofficial,

1252
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,710
we're just trying to
tie up some loose hands.

1253
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:51,860
- Well, I'm really not aware

1254
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,780
of what goes on outside this house.

1255
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:58,080
I uh, I, you know I do get out
of bit to see a few friends,

1256
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:03,080
but my life is really my flowers.

1257
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,763
These are from my nursery.

1258
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,230
- Oh, they're beautiful.

1259
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,483
- People say it's an ugly world.

1260
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:15,533
Flowers remind me that
the blame lies elsewhere.

1261
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,623
- Are those your sons?

1262
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:24,423
- Yes.

1263
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:29,890
- We understand that
you would occasionally

1264
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,693
visit a young girl.

1265
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,500
(door creaks)

1266
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:41,990
- What are y'all doing here?

1267
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,013
- Doyle, they just-

1268
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,920
- You got no business here.

1269
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,350
- Well, as I was telling your wife,

1270
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:51,803
it's an unofficial visit.

1271
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:56,243
- We've got a call first
policy in my house.

1272
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,183
- Look, they didn't do any-

1273
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,493
- Sorry for the intrusion Mrs. Potter.

1274
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:16,082
That produced a whole lot of nothing.

1275
01:07:16,082 --> 01:07:17,082
- It produced a lie.

1276
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,193
- What do you mean?

1277
01:07:19,193 --> 01:07:21,930
- Well at Linda's, Potter
said they only had one son.

1278
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:23,930
She just admitted they have two.

1279
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,270
There was a family picture with two sons

1280
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,090
and then a class picture.

1281
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,483
A school called Rosedale Hall.

1282
01:07:31,529 --> 01:07:33,581
- I've never heard of it,
but I'll check it out.

1283
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:34,414
- Okay.

1284
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,650
- We've got ourselves a real
potential problem here, Eddie

1285
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:39,910
and you're the cause of it.

1286
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,320
- Mr. Potter, I think I
got the situation in hand.

1287
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,210
- You've got your life in
your hands is what you've got.

1288
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:49,190
That bitch is gonna get
chatty to a grand jury.

1289
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,280
- She ain't gonna say nothing.

1290
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,510
I mean, she, she don't want-
- Shut up!

1291
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:54,680
I've had some calls. I
know what she's gonna do.

1292
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,980
Now, I've got an alibi.

1293
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:56,900
And so have the boys.

1294
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,720
We were playing cards together.

1295
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,810
You're gonna take this
fall by yourself, Eddie.

1296
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:03,210
- Yeah but you said, I mean,

1297
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,890
I mean about friends
and sticking together.

1298
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,640
- The bottom line, Eddie,

1299
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,323
is we do what's right for Rocky Valley.

1300
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:14,283
Now I'm bringing in jobs.

1301
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,163
What are you bringing in?

1302
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:21,143
Mr. Potter, me and Linda,
we owe you everything.

1303
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,250
We wouldn't let anybody
cause you no trouble.

1304
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:30,100
(Doyle laughs)

1305
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:35,100
- Well, just keep that
sister-in-law of yours

1306
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:38,143
from testifying, that's all, Eddie.

1307
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,623
Goodbye, Eddie.

1308
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:00,660
- Well she's gotta go.

1309
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,780
You got to make her go

1310
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,290
or they're gonna do something desperate.

1311
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,650
- Eddie, why are you so upset?

1312
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,790
Did somebody threaten you?

1313
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,177
- I'm worried for you and the kids.

1314
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:09,590
- Oh, they threatened us and
you're gonna defend them.

1315
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:11,030
Who are they, Eddie?

1316
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,710
- Honey, you know you are not
seeing the bigger picture.

1317
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:15,327
Alright?

1318
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:18,160
And your sister's ruining
everything for them, for us.

1319
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,930
And we're the town too.

1320
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:21,090
- No, they're the town.

1321
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,540
You're the ex-con they helped.

1322
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,083
And I'm the ex con's wife.

1323
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:27,720
- They like us.

1324
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,043
- As long as we're grateful.

1325
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,225
We don't owe them anything.

1326
01:09:33,225 --> 01:09:36,495
- That's what Archie said,
look what happened to him.

1327
01:09:36,495 --> 01:09:39,765
(ominous tones)

1328
01:09:39,765 --> 01:09:42,682
- How do you know what Archie said?

1329
01:09:45,877 --> 01:09:47,437
You were there, weren't you?

1330
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:48,837
- No, I wasn't there.

1331
01:09:48,837 --> 01:09:49,786
- What really happened, Eddie?

1332
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:53,286
- I don't know. I told you I wasn't there.

1333
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:55,523
- You were there. You know what happened.

1334
01:09:55,523 --> 01:09:57,883
And you've gotta tell me.

1335
01:09:59,576 --> 01:10:00,500
Eddie!

1336
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,400
- All right. I was there.

1337
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,803
All right? I was there.

1338
01:10:06,323 --> 01:10:07,910
But I was in the car.

1339
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,460
I was driving for Mr. Potter

1340
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,010
and I didn't get outta the car.

1341
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,500
Old Archie got drunk,
knocked over a kerosene lamp.

1342
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,110
You know the story, the
whole town knows the story

1343
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,900
and it's the truth.

1344
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:20,733
I swear it.

1345
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,010
- And what about Larson?

1346
01:10:26,343 --> 01:10:27,843
Eddie, look at me.

1347
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:31,003
Who shot Larson?

1348
01:10:31,003 --> 01:10:32,973
- I don't know. Now you leave me alone.

1349
01:10:39,564 --> 01:10:41,564
- It was you, wasn't it?

1350
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:48,880
- It was supposed to be a warning.

1351
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,730
I didn't mean it.

1352
01:10:53,135 --> 01:10:54,218
Listen to me.

1353
01:10:55,132 --> 01:10:57,263
I only wanted to scare him.

1354
01:10:57,263 --> 01:10:58,563
I didn't mean to hurt him.

1355
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:05,042
Oh baby.

1356
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:05,875
Oh.

1357
01:11:14,223 --> 01:11:15,056
- Eddie!

1358
01:11:17,697 --> 01:11:20,670
All your life, just
one mess after another.

1359
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,123
- Thanks.

1360
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:37,420
- You know I grew up in
a town like Rocky Valley.

1361
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,970
Life like this.

1362
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,450
I hated it.

1363
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:41,913
- I like small towns.

1364
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:48,953
I bet you don't even know

1365
01:11:48,953 --> 01:11:51,440
the name of your neighbor in the city.

1366
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,670
- Yes I do.

1367
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:54,002
Her name is 417.

1368
01:11:54,002 --> 01:11:57,510
- (laughs) Yeah, I know
you're being funny,

1369
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:01,560
but I think you like it that way.

1370
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,210
- I like knowing who I am
and making peace with that.

1371
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,700
- That makes you happy?

1372
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,733
- Makes me content.

1373
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,300
- What would make you happy?

1374
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,646
- To not be depressed by
the downside of my choices.

1375
01:12:15,646 --> 01:12:18,229
(Akins laughs)

1376
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,820
- I gather you've decided
not to have a family.

1377
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:25,860
- Apparently the same goes for you.

1378
01:12:27,466 --> 01:12:29,320
(sad music)

1379
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:34,220
- My wife and boy were
killed by a drunk driver.

1380
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,733
- Oh Brooke, I'm so sorry.

1381
01:12:36,956 --> 01:12:39,706
- I'm still not afraid to
start another family, though.

1382
01:12:41,168 --> 01:12:43,118
- You have a lot more guts than I have.

1383
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:47,590
Success in life to me is
how well I handle plan B.

1384
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:49,640
- So you're happier with the compromises?

1385
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,616
- Only because the
unhappiest people I know

1386
01:12:54,616 --> 01:12:57,500
are the ones who are surprised
that life isn't fair.

1387
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,763
I don't like surprises.

1388
01:13:01,709 --> 01:13:06,440
- Well, Ms. Martha, I like you.

1389
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,313
Surprised?

1390
01:13:18,787 --> 01:13:20,147
- [Linda] Goodnight, Brooke.

1391
01:13:20,147 --> 01:13:21,897
- [Brooke] Goodnight.

1392
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:33,554
(soft music)
(patrons conversing quietly)

1393
01:13:55,233 --> 01:13:57,400
- [Man] Get on outta here.

1394
01:14:00,313 --> 01:14:04,455
(man clears his throat)

1395
01:14:04,455 --> 01:14:05,788
- [Man] Bye bye.

1396
01:14:07,551 --> 01:14:09,149
- [Man] We better go back in.

1397
01:14:09,149 --> 01:14:10,949
My brother.
- Oh yeah.

1398
01:14:10,949 --> 01:14:12,282
- [Man] Alright.

1399
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,579
(engine revs)

1400
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:16,780
(tense music)

1401
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,363
(Martha pants)

1402
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:38,280
(crashing)

1403
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:43,310
(Martha exclaims)

1404
01:14:55,845 --> 01:14:58,797
- (groans) I'm okay. Really, I'm fine.

1405
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,300
- (sighs) Well what you described

1406
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,900
is a four wheeler with light bars.

1407
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,445
2/3 of the vehicles in this
town are four wheelers.

1408
01:15:08,445 --> 01:15:10,760
- Yeah, but this one had
a piece of a barn on it.

1409
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,260
- Now will you allow me
to assign you a deputy?

1410
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,093
- A local?

1411
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,627
- No, I can get someone
from another jurisdiction.

1412
01:15:16,627 --> 01:15:17,623
- That'd take a lotta time.

1413
01:15:17,623 --> 01:15:19,203
Well, I'll get right on it.

1414
01:15:20,534 --> 01:15:23,523
And I'll get someone to
pick up your car too.

1415
01:15:26,297 --> 01:15:28,401
- Thanks, Brooke.
- Sure.

1416
01:15:28,401 --> 01:15:29,401
- Goodnight.

1417
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:25,135
- [Woman] Come on. Now
you're getting the towel wet.

1418
01:16:25,135 --> 01:16:26,434
- [Girl] A little splash.

1419
01:16:26,434 --> 01:16:27,827
- [Woman] Oh good. Well come on.

1420
01:16:27,827 --> 01:16:28,967
- [Man] The suntan lotion.

1421
01:16:28,967 --> 01:16:30,203
- [Woman] There you go.

1422
01:16:32,728 --> 01:16:34,328
- I'm sorry about what happened.

1423
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,153
I'm sorry.

1424
01:16:42,202 --> 01:16:43,553
Is there somewhere we can talk?

1425
01:16:46,818 --> 01:16:50,133
- [Man] Y'all stay where I can see ya.

1426
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:54,133
- [Woman] That's good
honey, all the way across.

1427
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,073
- Sounds like dad's old Plymouth.

1428
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:12,631
(Linda sighs)

1429
01:17:12,631 --> 01:17:17,053
- It, it's just, I know everything now.

1430
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,960
- I know that Eddie was there

1431
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,423
when Archie Maddox died, and
I know Eddie shot Larson.

1432
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,453
- Oh thank God.

1433
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,667
Now you see why you and the
kids have to come away with me.

1434
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:33,813
No, but Eddie told me what happened

1435
01:17:33,813 --> 01:17:35,490
and I know what he did is wrong.

1436
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,770
- Don't finish that sentence, Linda.

1437
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,330
- He's my husband, Martha, and

1438
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,560
- How can I shake some sense into you?

1439
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,680
Don't you see the pattern?

1440
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,210
Mother never listened either.

1441
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:44,790
Her death was an escape.

1442
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,920
It was easier for her to
die than to face reality.

1443
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,780
(tense music)

1444
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:53,240
Linda, wait, please listen to me.

1445
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,770
- You don't give people
any room do ya, Martha?

1446
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,570
And if they take too much
time finding themselves,

1447
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:58,810
you just dump 'em.

1448
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:00,520
Eddie's right, you don't care about me.

1449
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,410
- That's not true.

1450
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,160
- You're selfish, Martha, you always were.

1451
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,480
That's why you bailed out on me.

1452
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,210
- I know the responsibility
I left you with.

1453
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,590
I felt guilty my whole life.

1454
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,860
- Oh, I'll make ya a deal.

1455
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:12,630
I'll take your guilt if you
give me those years back.

1456
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,310
I figure you owe me one, Martha.

1457
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:15,143
- I do owe you.

1458
01:18:15,143 --> 01:18:16,380
- You want to help me and the kids?

1459
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,700
You want to make things right?

1460
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,533
- Yes.

1461
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:19,780
- Then lie to the grand jury

1462
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,380
and don't tell them about Eddie.

1463
01:18:22,715 --> 01:18:25,290
(explosion booms)
(women exclaim)

1464
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:27,873
(Linda grunts)

1465
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,170
- Oh, not necessary.

1466
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:35,070
- Come on, get in.

1467
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,113
It's hospital rules.

1468
01:18:37,651 --> 01:18:38,901
Thank you, I'll take her.

1469
01:18:43,112 --> 01:18:44,210
Your sister okay?

1470
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,043
- Yeah.

1471
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,460
- I'll put you up in my hotel.

1472
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,760
They won't touch ya there.

1473
01:18:49,727 --> 01:18:51,684
You alright? You cold?

1474
01:18:51,684 --> 01:18:52,517
- Yeah.

1475
01:18:52,517 --> 01:18:54,203
I guess it's a delayed
reaction or something.

1476
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,960
Thanks.
- There you go.

1477
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,290
- Could we stop by Linda's

1478
01:18:58,290 --> 01:18:59,872
so I can get something else to wear?

1479
01:18:59,872 --> 01:19:01,539
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1480
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:04,480
- I have some interesting news.

1481
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,090
That school photograph you
saw at the Potter's house.

1482
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:11,290
- Rosedale Hall?
- Yeah. It's in Galveston.

1483
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:14,000
It's a special school.

1484
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,150
- [Martha] Special how?

1485
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,053
- For impaired children.

1486
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:22,780
I'll get the car.

1487
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:25,873
Mrs. Potter.

1488
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,080
- Are you all right?

1489
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:29,913
- I'm fine.

1490
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:32,843
- How is your sister?
I came to check on her.

1491
01:19:32,843 --> 01:19:34,870
- Well she's going to be okay.

1492
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,423
Mrs. Potter, could I talk to you?

1493
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,523
- I can't.

1494
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:45,890
- Mrs. Potter, your husband
said that you have only one son.

1495
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:49,760
At your house there were two
boys in the photo next to you.

1496
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,320
Why did you lie?

1497
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,900
- I had two sons.

1498
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:54,883
One is dead.

1499
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,160
The other is fine.

1500
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,320
In spite of what his father says.

1501
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,120
- May I ask how your other son died?

1502
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,253
- No.
- Mrs. Potter.

1503
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:06,433
I know about Tina.

1504
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:10,810
I know she's Archie's
daughter and used to bring her

1505
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,150
to visit him.

1506
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,600
Now the secrets that are buried here

1507
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,140
are gonna come out with or without you.

1508
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,940
You're gonna have to face that fact.

1509
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,390
- You're doing real well, Brenda.

1510
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,536
Keep going now.

1511
01:20:29,536 --> 01:20:30,682
Yeah.

1512
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:31,743
There.

1513
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,326
There you go. Good.

1514
01:20:36,278 --> 01:20:38,493
That a girl, Brenda.

1515
01:20:38,493 --> 01:20:40,740
- This the same school
you saw in the picture?

1516
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:41,990
- Well, it looks like it.

1517
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:47,951
- [Woman] We could just go down the block.

1518
01:20:47,951 --> 01:20:49,451
- Alright.
- Down the corner.

1519
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,780
- [Woman] Ready for our field
to look so much better now.

1520
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,390
- Well, I think it was the flowers here

1521
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,580
that convinced Hilda Potter

1522
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,780
this should be the home for her son.

1523
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,320
- How'd he die?

1524
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:03,590
- Uremia, poor little guy,
one thing after another.

1525
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,044
- Well, what was the matter with him?

1526
01:21:05,044 --> 01:21:07,240
- Galactosemia.
- What's that?

1527
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,920
Disturbance in the
metabolism of milk, sugar,

1528
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,030
retardation, underdeveloped physically,

1529
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:13,280
large liver and spleen.

1530
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,510
- Brooke?

1531
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:17,400
The kids said that there was
something strange about Tina.

1532
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,570
They could've meant retarded.

1533
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:20,142
- [Nurse] That's odd.

1534
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:20,975
- What?

1535
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,570
- Mrs. Potter comes to visit a young girl

1536
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:25,560
that she and Mr. Potter
brought us about a year ago

1537
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,250
from an institution.

1538
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:30,423
Her name is Katie Bass,
but she calls herself Tina.

1539
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:37,113
A lotta these paintings
on the wall are Katie's.

1540
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,997
(residents chattering quietly)

1541
01:21:51,915 --> 01:21:53,020
Hi, Katie.

1542
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,750
Someone wants to talk to you, sweetie.

1543
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:55,583
- Hi.

1544
01:21:56,879 --> 01:21:57,712
- Hi.

1545
01:21:58,670 --> 01:21:59,720
- Did you paint this?

1546
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:01,550
- Yeah.

1547
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:04,410
- Oh it's a sunset. It's just beautiful.

1548
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:05,243
- Thanks.

1549
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,033
- You have her records?
- Of course.

1550
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:11,960
- I'll bet they're forged.

1551
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,100
- I beg your pardon.

1552
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,520
- We have reason to believe

1553
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,750
Katie Bass' real name is Tina Maddox.

1554
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,463
- But the Potters themselves
brought her to us.

1555
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,851
- Did you paint this for me?

1556
01:22:25,851 --> 01:22:26,909
- Yeah.

1557
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:29,163
- Oh, thank you, Tina.

1558
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:31,653
- Tina.

1559
01:22:38,098 --> 01:22:40,765
(ominous tones)

1560
01:23:01,404 --> 01:23:02,904
- [Eddie] Come on.

1561
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:16,289
What's going on?

1562
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:21,783
- Eddie, we need to talk.

1563
01:23:22,893 --> 01:23:24,584
- You kids go on, get in the house.

1564
01:23:24,584 --> 01:23:27,167
Come on, get in there. Come on.

1565
01:23:34,403 --> 01:23:37,500
- Eddie, I think I figured
a way outta this mess

1566
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,333
you got us into.

1567
01:23:40,396 --> 01:23:42,813
- Mr. Potter, me and Linda...

1568
01:23:54,389 --> 01:23:57,056
(Eddie panting)

1569
01:24:08,269 --> 01:24:09,102
- Eddie?

1570
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:11,164
Eddie?

1571
01:24:12,118 --> 01:24:13,929
- Oh baby.
- What happened?

1572
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:15,096
What happened?

1573
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:18,653
- They took the kids.

1574
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:21,610
There was nothing I coulda done.

1575
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:22,443
- Timothy!

1576
01:24:23,721 --> 01:24:24,554
Emily!

1577
01:24:31,393 --> 01:24:33,404
They've taken my kids!

1578
01:24:33,404 --> 01:24:35,304
- They'll be returned after I testify.

1579
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:39,930
- It says after you
testify you saw nothing.

1580
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:40,763
- I'm gonna call the police.

1581
01:24:40,763 --> 01:24:42,290
- No, you're not calling the police.

1582
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:44,220
No police, no Akins, no nothing.

1583
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:45,740
For a change you're gonna
do what you're told.

1584
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:46,970
You've caused enough trouble already.

1585
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:48,120
These are my kids.

1586
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,690
You do what it says.

1587
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:50,523
Do you hear me?

1588
01:24:50,523 --> 01:24:51,460
Do you hear me?

1589
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:54,017
- Listen, you stay by the phone.

1590
01:24:54,017 --> 01:24:59,017
I gotta get me some stitches.

1591
01:25:07,257 --> 01:25:08,326
- [Linda] Where are you going?

1592
01:25:08,326 --> 01:25:09,159
Martha!

1593
01:25:20,146 --> 01:25:24,610
(doorbell rings)
(knocking at door)

1594
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:25,730
- Mrs. Potter.

1595
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:26,563
Mrs. Potter.

1596
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:30,211
Mrs. Potter who painted this?

1597
01:25:30,211 --> 01:25:33,090
- (scoffs) Well wasn't Gauguin.

1598
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:36,350
- Tina Maddox only with forged papers.

1599
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:39,540
She's registered at
Rosedale Hall a Katie Bass.

1600
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,513
You visit her there under that name.

1601
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,770
But you took her to see her father, Archie

1602
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:47,243
under her real name, Tina Maddox.

1603
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:51,570
Archie loved that little girl.

1604
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,943
But he never told anyone about her.

1605
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:57,833
He and his wife were divorced.

1606
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:00,790
Tina lived with her mother until she died.

1607
01:26:02,126 --> 01:26:04,303
And Archie had to put her an institution.

1608
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,913
They just soak up love
when they're like that.

1609
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,570
My son was-
- I know.

1610
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:17,470
I know. And I'm so very, very sorry.

1611
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:19,230
But now that's over.

1612
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:22,000
Your husband murdered Archie Maddox.

1613
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,480
And he stole his land.

1614
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,500
And if we hadn't found Tina,

1615
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,090
he might've gotten away with it.

1616
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:27,563
That land belongs to her.

1617
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,610
- Archie's death was an accident.

1618
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:31,610
- Maybe.

1619
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:33,590
But the second one wasn't.

1620
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:35,520
I saw Larson killed. I saw Eddie do it.

1621
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,440
And your husband was
standing right next to him.

1622
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,590
Now they've kidnapped
my sister's children.

1623
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,760
- They've gone too far to turn back now.

1624
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,634
- Stop it.

1625
01:26:44,634 --> 01:26:45,750
(Hilda gasps)
(glass shatters)

1626
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:49,143
Two children you love are going
to die unless you speak up.

1627
01:26:51,361 --> 01:26:53,861
(tense music)

1628
01:27:16,842 --> 01:27:19,509
(ominous music)

1629
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,330
- What have you done?

1630
01:27:27,962 --> 01:27:29,545
What have you done?

1631
01:27:35,351 --> 01:27:37,037
(gunfire pops)

1632
01:27:37,037 --> 01:27:38,603
- Dangerous man, Jake.

1633
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,542
- Who the hell is that?

1634
01:27:44,542 --> 01:27:47,042
- You better go on outta here.

1635
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:05,820
- Linda, no.

1636
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:06,653
- Eddie!

1637
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:09,130
Where are they, Eddie?

1638
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,324
- Easy, there was never no danger.

1639
01:28:10,324 --> 01:28:11,820
It was just like a big game to 'em, honey.

1640
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,393
Okay? Take it easy, sweetie.

1641
01:28:13,393 --> 01:28:14,643
- Mommy! Mommy!

1642
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,173
- Eddie!

1643
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:49,680
Take your family in the trailer, Eddie.

1644
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,570
Get 'em on in there so we can talk.

1645
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,930
- We're leaving now.

1646
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:59,140
Linda, get the kids in the truck.

1647
01:28:59,140 --> 01:28:59,973
You too.

1648
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,200
- Do what I tell ya, Eddie.

1649
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,033
Not this time.

1650
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,693
- Hold it right there, son.

1651
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,200
- You know it's funny you
callin' me son like that.

1652
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,490
'Cause I always looked at you as a father.

1653
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:24,780
Even when you was gonna dump me.

1654
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:28,873
You and the others gonna let
me take the fall for all of ya.

1655
01:29:30,136 --> 01:29:33,303
And still I looked at you as a father.

1656
01:29:34,626 --> 01:29:35,726
And them as my family.

1657
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:37,877
- We were just trying to motivate you.

1658
01:29:37,877 --> 01:29:41,103
- Oh, you got me real motivated,
Mr. Potter, real motivated.

1659
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:44,523
One question.

1660
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,500
Being that I owe you and all,

1661
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,440
was you gonna ask me to
kill my kids for you too?

1662
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,140
- Don't do anything stupid, Eddie.

1663
01:29:53,147 --> 01:29:55,624
- I'm gonna do something
smart for a change.

1664
01:29:55,624 --> 01:29:57,320
In fact, it's gonna hurt you all the more.

1665
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,843
'Cause it was dumb ole Eddie
Pick that done it to y'all.

1666
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:01,871
(gunfire pops)

1667
01:30:01,871 --> 01:30:04,538
(all screaming)

1668
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,613
- Daddy!
- Eddie!

1669
01:30:12,261 --> 01:30:15,286
(gunfire pops)

1670
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:16,302
(Doyle yells)

1671
01:30:16,302 --> 01:30:19,135
(Martha exclaims)

1672
01:30:20,422 --> 01:30:23,212
(Doyle yells)

1673
01:30:23,212 --> 01:30:25,629
(body thuds)

1674
01:30:30,503 --> 01:30:33,420
(tense, sad music)

1675
01:30:39,527 --> 01:30:42,444
(train horn blows)

1676
01:30:48,979 --> 01:30:51,440
- I guess she's not coming.

1677
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,683
- Just give her time, Martha.

1678
01:30:53,683 --> 01:30:54,550
She's lost a lot.

1679
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:55,620
- I know.

1680
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,501
What's gonna happen to Eddie?

1681
01:30:57,501 --> 01:30:59,140
- He'll testify against
Jake and the others,

1682
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:02,470
they'll be bargaining from
murder one down to manslaughter,

1683
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:04,693
most likely, maybe if he's lucky.

1684
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:07,770
But the town will be dead to him

1685
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:08,920
and to your sister too.

1686
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,143
She and the kids'll need
you now more than ever.

1687
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:17,403
(gentle music)

1688
01:31:33,481 --> 01:31:35,740
- Can the kids and I come visit ya?

1689
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,590
- Do you want to?

1690
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:41,830
- That's what families do, don't they?

1691
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,033
- Are we a family?

1692
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:47,050
- Yeah, we're a family.

1693
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:48,150
- We'll work this out.

1694
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,510
This time I'll be there for you.

1695
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,343
- I know.

1696
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,403
- [Conductor] All aboard.

1697
01:32:04,028 --> 01:32:05,028
- Thank you.

1698
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:22,495
- [Conductor] Watch your step, please.

1699
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,328
Welcome aboard, ma'am.

1700
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,556
(train horn blows)

1701
01:32:32,707 --> 01:32:34,336
- I love you.

1702
01:32:34,336 --> 01:32:36,336
- I love you too.

1703
01:32:36,336 --> 01:32:39,003
(hopeful music)

1704
01:32:54,745 --> 01:32:57,662
(train horn blows)

1705
01:33:08,657 --> 01:33:12,407
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1706
01:33:57,933 --> 01:34:00,683
(bright chiming)
