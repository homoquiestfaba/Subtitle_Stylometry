00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:48,178
>> Here you go, boy.

00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:51,529
>> Ah.

4
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:54,271
>> Well, I guess I'll go
shower and shave.

00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,795
>> Thanks for sharing thatwith me, Jon.

6
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,667
Yes folks, this is my life.

7
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:01,931
While it may look vital andstimulating, it really isn't.

8
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,976
That's because Jon's a dork.

9
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:06,457
He really needs to get a life,and I intend

10
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,938
to help him find one.
Why?

11
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,983
Because Jon's my friend, and I'ddo

12
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:13,595
anything to help my friend, nomatter what.

13
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,685
Unless of course, there'ssomething good on TV.

14
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:21,342
Ah, time for my favorite show,Yukon Stinky.

This week, Yukon Stinky insultsa polar bear.

16
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:29,132
Can't miss that.
Eh, Jon's life can wait.

17
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:45,975
>> Well, Stinky, I guess thiscase is closed!

18
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:47,716
>> Give em heck, Stinky.

19
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:49,413

27
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:13,959
And that!>> Oh.

28
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,788
>> And that.If it's not too much trouble!

29
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:19,051
And if you don't mind!

30
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:23,795
>> That should be enoughstimulation for one morning.

31

Garfield, did you know thebedroom ceiling has 144 tiles?

35
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,471
>> The living room has 214.

36
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:48,951
>> I'm bored.

37
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,953
>> Why don't you organizeyour sock drawer?

38
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:53,260
>> I'd organize my sockdrawer, but I just organized

39
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,961
it last night.>> I'll be the judge of that.

40
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,224
Whoa, I'm impressed.

41
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:05,010
All nicely tucked and sorted, bycolor and size.

>> There's underwear.>> There's a bigger world out

51
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:26,815
there beyond the sock drawer,and I'm gonna live it.

52
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,683
>> Nice touch.

53
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:18,170
Haven't you got a life yet?

54
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,042
What are you waiting for?

55
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:23,263
Do I have to do everythingaround here?

>> How to make friends, andfool the rest?

57
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,582

sincerity.

58
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,541
>> I forgot, I had this book.

59
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,544
Hey, this chapter on gettingdates, is just the ticket.

60
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:46,503
>> Great, read it and give mea full report.

61
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,897
The sooner you get happy withyour life,

00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,986
the sooner I can get back tomine.

63
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:53,162
Humans, never satisfied.

64
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,598
If only they'd learn to be

65
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,818
content with the simple thingsin life.

66
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,950
Like lasagna, a good nap,

68
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,572

00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:15,619
the ticket, for a happening
kind of guy like me. Let's
get to work.

70
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,055
>> Whatever.

She wants to dance with me.

75
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:27,718

I seem to have lost my

00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:07,791
Olympic swimming medals aroundhere, somewhere.

101
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,100
I might have lost them overthere or over there.

102
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,841
I just can't remember.

103
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:17,148
Oh well, I think I'll do somepush-ups.

104
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:21,762
Out of my way creep, oops.

>> So, as I was
saying to myself

108
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,772
when I saw you standing there,this is obviously

110
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,777

Maybe, I'll become a nun.

129
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,212
>> As long as it gets
you out of the house.

130

Are you so boring, that youcould make cheese yawn?

Well it's, it's not that it'sboring so much as,

I just, I just don't haveanything unusually

00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:13,602
interesting going on. Uh, notat the present, anyway.

And this is my, are you

203
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,722
uh, the Lorenzo in thecommercial?

204
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:47,941
>> In person.

205
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,594
>> Gee, on TV you sounded so,so.

206
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,509
>> So what?
>> So alive.

207
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,774
>> Oh ha, that was lip syncyou know.

208
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,514
My body, Charleston Heston'svoice.

209
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:59,039
Its a, its theatrical thing,it's done quite often.

210
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,692
>> I see.

211
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,999
>> Onward and upward, shallwe?

212
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:07,699
Have a seat Mr., Airbuckle?Good morning class.

213
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,658
Welcome to the Lorenzo School,

214
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:12,269
for the Personality ImpairedInc.

215
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:15,055
Remember our motto is, if youcan

216
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,579
get a pulse, you can get a life.

217
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,189
So the first thing we're goingto do

218
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:22,932
this morning, is check ourselvesfor a pulse.

219
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:25,587
If you don't have one, pleaseraise your hand.

220
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:27,807
Oh my, I see we have several.

221
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,679
Well uh, keep your hands up inthe air, while my

222
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,508
able assistant, Priscilla, willcome around

223
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,249
and give you a second opinion.

224
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,817
The first step to becoming avital person,

225
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,689
is to make a good
first impression.

226
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,170
Now, how do I do that, you mightask?

227
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,869
Well, I'll tell you how I dothat, you might ask.

228
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,828
You do that by walking right upto the person,

229
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,786
looking them right in theeye,

230
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,527
giving them a firm
handshake, and

231
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:56,052
saying, hello, my name is so andso.

232
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,272
Everyone, turn to the personnext to

233
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,927
you and give it a try, now.

234
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,581
>> Hello, my name is so and so.

235
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:11,372
>> Hello, my name is Jon.>> Hi, I'm Mona.

236
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,722
>> Hello, my name is
Garfield, you probably

237
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,856
noticed I'm quite short and haveexcessive body hair.

238
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,119
>> Was that okay?
>> Was what okay?

239
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,164
>> My first impression, Ireally

240
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:22,687
have no idea what I'm doing.

241
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,950
>> Oh, good.

242
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,690
>> Huh?
>> Neither do I.

243
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,084
How was mine?
>> Your what?

244
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:28,998
>> My first impression.

245
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,826
>> Oh, fine!I guess.

246
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,654
>> You guess? I knew it!>> What?

247
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,134
>> I have something betweenmy teeth, don't I?

248
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,918
>> Oh no, no, your teeth arefine!

249
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,398
See?

250
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,269
>> See what?>> I'm blowing it!

251
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,271
I'm making a lousy first
impression.

252
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,665
>> No, you're not!
I guess.

253
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:46,668
>> Yeah, what do we know.

254
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,365
>> The second part of today'slesson,

255
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:51,151
is learning to dress for
success.

256
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,153
>> Huh, I'm naked.

257
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,155
>> In all modesty, I mustconfess,

258
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:58,680
in some circles I amconsidered a fashion plate,

259
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,204
if you will.

260
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:04,904
Let me share a few of my fashionsecrets with you, now.

261
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,732
Rule number one, notice how I've

262
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:11,127
coordinated my pocket protectorwith my socks.

263
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,390
Well, my left one, at any rate.

264
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,307
When it comes to color, I thinksay, wear all the same color?

265
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:21,094
Your ensemble should be havevirtual smorgasbord,

266
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,486
for the eyes.

267
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:23,879
Notice how I've accented

268
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,794
my green tweet slacks with this

269
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:28,405
plaid jacket and this stringtie.

270
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:31,278
>> Why do I have this suddenurge, to play golf?

271
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,454
>> Nothing impresses peoplemore, than

272
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,586
when you speak in a foreignlanguage.

273
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,024
Say for instance, Canadian.

274
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:40,374
Now, this is an easy language tolearn.

275
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:42,202
You just talk like you normallywould,

276
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:45,770
except occasionally, you throwin an eh.

277
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,599
Example, I'm going to town, eh.

278
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:51,733
>> I am going to town, eh.

279
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,430
>> Great, let's all go totown, eh.

280
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,389
Maybe we can have some lunch,eh?

281
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,304
>> I was so shy in gym class,

282
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:59,654
I had my sister take my showersfor me.

283
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:02,570
>> I was so shy, I almoststarved to death once,

284
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,267
because Ididn't tell my dad I was hungry.

285
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,529
>> You're not shy.

286
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,531
>> Oh yes I am.>> No, you're not.

287
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:10,230
You're like that guy on thebeach yesterday.

288
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,798
>> Uh, what guy?
>> Oh, just some guy.

289
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:16,627
He was walking around flexinghis muscles, and

290
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:20,283
looking for his Olympic swimmingmedals.

291
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,289
>> You don't really have tolearn a

292
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,683
language, if you can sound likeyou speak it.

293
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:31,381
People are really impressed ifyou can speak French

294
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,470
or if you can sound like, youspeak French.

295
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,602
Example.

296
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:43,872
>> Oh.
>> Very impressive, no?

297
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,308
>> You know, I've had just

298
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,397
about enough sophistication forone day.

299
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:48,442
How about you?

300
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,014
>> Hey you, Monsieur dumbguy, remember me?

301
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,321
What am I, chopped liver?Duck pate?

302
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,062
Foie gras?

303
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,021
Why am I getting so hungry?

304
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:04,893
>> That's a funny story.

305
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,069
>> Oh, it's been a wonderfulday, Jon.

306
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,463
Class was great and dinner wasfun.

307
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:13,380
But most of all, I reallyenjoyed talking to you.

308
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,817
Until I met you, I thought I wasthe only person

309
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,559
in the world, to get my tonguecaught in an elevator door.

310
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,170
>> And we didn't even have tospeak French.

311
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,911
>> What?
>> Think about it.

312
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,131
We had a wonderful eveningwithout having to

313
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,437
rely on anything, we learned inclass today.

314
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:29,265
>> You mean, we can be
ourselves

315
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:30,919
and still have a good
time?

316
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,573
>> Mm-hm. It's a theory worthpursuing.

317
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:33,835
>> What a concept.

318
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,924
>> I know, I've been workingso hard

319
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,926
to be what I thought otherpeople wanted.

320
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,971
I almost forgot, who I was.

321
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:43,323
>> Well, I'm glad I met theyou, you.

322
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,194
>> Huh, I was fresh out ofother me's.

323
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,849
Do you know, I've never beenable to open up

324
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:50,721
to anyone like this before,other than my cat that, is.

325
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,941
>> Other than my cat, thatis.

326
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,464
My cat.

327
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:58,555
Yesterday, I had a name.Yesterday, I was his bosom

328
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:02,124
buddy, his confidant, today I'mhis cat.

329
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,521
I can't believe it.

330
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,175
Jon's actually met someone wholikes

331
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,959
him, and it's not even hismother.

332
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,004
What's this world coming to?

333
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,442
Who would have guessed?

334
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:59,616
Oh no.
Poor Jon!

335
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,444
He doesn't know, what he'sgetting into.

336
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,881
I must stop him, before hemultiplies.

337
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,232
>> Then in my senior year, Iwas voted

338
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:09,148
most likely, to sit around thehouse, a lot.

339
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,846
And then, Garfield, what are youdoing?

340
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,108
>> Let go of her, Jon.

341
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,718
Who knows where that hand hasbeen.

342
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:17,156
>> What a sweet cat!

343
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,809
>> Don't listen to her Jon,she's trying

344
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,333
to get to you, through me

345
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,074
>> Would you like me toscratch behind your ears?

346
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,816
>> Oh that's good, she's verysmart, Jon.

347
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:28,036
Once she has me in her clutchesshe'll perhaps,

348
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,299
just a little bit behind thisear.

349
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,392
Jon listen carefully, it's alla.

350
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,917
