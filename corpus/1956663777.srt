00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,601
[Gen] Of course you would do Belleview.

342
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,897
You're so predictable, Lara Jean.
It's quite adorable.

343
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,901
- I guess you're doing Oakwood.
- Sorting through half-rotten produce?

344
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,984
No, thank you.

345
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,157
So, I saw on your story
that you went to Cardona's this weekend?

346

Classic Kavinsky.

347
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,888
You know, by the time we broke up,
I actually thought I was gonna die

348
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,206
if I had any more <i>cacio e pepe.</i>

349
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,960
Pro tip: If you do want to fit
into your jeans come summer,

350
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,505
you should probably start ordering salad.

352
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,224

about his past relationship with Gen.</i>

353
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,893
<i>But for every first I was having with him,</i>

354
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,771

355
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,567

356
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,211
Yeah. It's for my boyfriend. I'm sorry.

357
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,301
You don't need this chair,
do you, Lara Jean?

358
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,325
I do.

359
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,828
Peter's on his way.

360
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,671
- He's just running a little behind.
- Is he?

361
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,753
- Is anybody using this chair?
- Yes. My boyfriend, he's coming.

369
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,782
I'm really sorry.

370
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,077
I should've came up with a better plan
that didn't leave you hanging.

371
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,496
Yeah, you should've.

372

374
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,712
- Call your dad.
- What?

375
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,195
Tell him you're gonna be home late.

376
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,673

377
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,383
I'm taking you out.

Come on.

386
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,984
We are here together at Sizzler.

- Here we go!

- I know!

Mrs. Rothschild. I think they should date.

She's divorced, you know.

Right. Because Dad,

is suddenly gonna start dating

Sounds a bit delusional, Kitty.

Okay. [chuckles]

684
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,207
Before you go too far with Kavinsky,

685
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,335
make sure you are 100 percent...

686
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:34,549
- No, 1000 percent sure...
- That it's something that I want. I know.

687
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,152
- Trust me, I'm not...
- Actually, I was gonna say something else.

688
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,513
I am trying to make sure you know
how to rev your own engine

689
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:44,684
before you let anyone under the hood.

690
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,105
Chris, we all know
you can't wink. It's okay.

691
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,525
I'm just saying! Make sure you know
how to look after you!

692
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,610
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it, thank you.

693
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,369
[Trevor] Hey.

694
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,121
Mm-hmm.

695
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,624
Are you sure there's no other reason why
you wanted to eat in the woodshop today?

696
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,920
We both like the smell of sawdust
and that is not a crime.

697
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,046
I'm gonna go.

698
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,762
I think this is yours.

699
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,267
Thanks.

700
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,979
[mouthing] Oh, my God.

701
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,147
Shut up.

702
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,820
- Oh! John Ambrose, good to see you again!
- Hi, Mrs. Glick.

703
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,071
Oh, hi, John.

704
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,617
Today's gonna be a fun day.
I have an exciting project for you two.

705
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,329
Our annual Belleview garden party
is coming up.

706
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:50,583
Last year we got rained out,
so we decided to move it indoors.

707
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,585
So we're gonna do
the garden party in here?

708
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,504
Yup! Put out some potted ferns,
cheese platter.

709
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,308
I dunno, some twinkle lights?
It'll be fine.

710
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,884
But, I need you two
to clear out this space.

711
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,053
- It's become a bit of a junk room.
- Wow.

712
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:02,970
What is this?

713
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,056
Mr. Sawoski's failed green thumb attempt

714
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,559
and belongings of residents who passed.

715
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,978
Alone. With no family members
to claim them.

716
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,857
Make two piles, okay? Trash and donations.

717
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:29,247
When I heard "garden party,"
I imagined art deco elegance.

718
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,958
Not a couple potted plants
and a cheese plate.

719
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,336
Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of depressing.

720
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,921
Yeah.

721
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,800
Look at this.

722
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,098
Oh. Old love letters
from someone stationed in Italy.

723
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,855
He sent her his photo
with a note on the back.

724
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,816
"My darling Linda..."

725
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,612
Oh, this seems personal.
I feel a little funny reading this.

726
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,407
[John Ambrose] Wanna read this instead?

727
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,452
Remember, it's only a loan.

728
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,708
That it is.

729
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,389
[sighs]

730
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,728
Mm. Okay...

731
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,528
<i>"Dear John Ambrose,</i>

732
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,489
<i>do you remember the Halloween party
at Matt Kaplan's barn?</i>

733
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,702
<i>I planned my costume for weeks.
I was so excited.</i>

734
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,746
<i>I didn't tell anyone what I was gonna be.</i>

735
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,081
<i>And then, I got there.</i>

736
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,293
<i>It's like everyone except me
got the cool kid memo that</i>

737
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,712
<i>no one really dresses up
for Halloween anymore.</i>

738
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,589
<i>I felt so lame.</i>

739
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,799
<i>Like I didn't fit in.</i>

740
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,678
<i>And then, you walked in as a deviled egg.</i>

741
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,557
<i>And I realized...
maybe I'm lame in a cool way.</i>

742
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,225
<i>And that's when I knew.</i>

743
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,562
<i>I knew it all the way down
to my candy red sneakers.</i>

744
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,316
<i>I love you, John Ambrose.
I really love you.</i>

745
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,903
<i>Why, oh, why do you have to move away?</i>

746
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,741
<i>Maybe someday we'll meet again,
and you'll never know I felt any of this.</i>

747
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,701
<i>But, I'll know.</i>

748
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,537
<i>I'll always know that once upon a time,</i>

749
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,539
<i>my heart was yours."</i>

750
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,004
<i>I cannot believe I wrote that.</i>

751
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,839
<i>I cannot believe he read that.</i>

752
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,385
<i>I cannot believe he's downstairs knowing
I just read what he read that I wrote.</i>

753
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,594
[door closing]

754
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,139
[Stormy] Lara Jean, are you okay?

755
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,850
I don't know.

756
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,727
Come into my room.

757
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,064
No woman should be out in public
with that look on her face.

758
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,609
"Maybe one day, we'll meet again.

759
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,070
I'll always know that once upon a time,

760
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,447
my heart was yours.

761
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,324
Love, Lara Jean."

762
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,784
Why?

763
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,120
Why did I write these stupid love letters?

764
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,955
I think it's exciting.

765
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,958
You predicted that you'd meet again.

766
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,251
And here you are.

767
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,335
I have a boyfriend.

768
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,381
So? Almost every one of my love affairs
overlapped with another one.

769
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,466
Well, this is different.

770
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,861
Peter and I promised
not to break each other's hearts.

771
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,221
Oh, honey, you're always
breaking someone's heart,

772
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,597
or they're breaking yours.

773
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,267
Well, isn't there a way
to both get out unscathed?

774
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,227
Not if you're doing it right.

775
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,522
I think it's time we both had a drink.

776
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,690
Stormy.

777
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,692
I'm 16.

778
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,110
Suit yourself.

779
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,446
More for me.

780
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,656
I'll just get you some soda.

781
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,701
When I was young, the drinking age was 18,

782
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,161
and you're not far from that.

783
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,538
That's about when I met my first husband.

784
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,621
How did you meet?

785
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,416
Oh, he was our neighbor.

786
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,709
And he was a songwriter.

787
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,379
And I can remember sitting around
our living room, listening to him sing.

788
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,465
And then one day,

789
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,468
I discovered that the song was about me.

790
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,013
If a man ever writes you a song,

791
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,267
then you know for sure
that he's got it bad.

792
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,935
What about a poem?

793
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,520
Well, yeah. Sure. Same thing.

794
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,315
A poem is just a song
without the music part.

795
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,068
For Valentine's Day,
Peter wrote me the most beautiful poem.

796
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,029
I bet you know it, too.

797
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,698
[sighing]

798
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,243
"The moon never beams
without bringing me dreams

799
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,995
of beautiful Lara Jean.

800
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,331
And the stars never rise..."

801
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,541
"But I feel the bright eyes

802
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,627
of beautiful Annabel Lee."

803
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,213
Uh, how did you...

804
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,511
Your young man has very good taste.
I'll give him that.

805
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:58,015
But I'm sorry to tell you
that the author of that particular poem

806
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,017
is Edgar Allen Poe.

807
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,648
You want to rethink that drink option?

808
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,110
[boy] Go!

809
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,029
[indistinct chatter and music]

810
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,155
Ah!

811
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,993
- [laughter]
- Oh, wait, come on. What was that?

812
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,747
- Let's go, I ain't stopping!
- [Gen] Let's take one for Insta.

813
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,541
- Hi, Mom.
- [camera clicks]

814
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,335
Now one for the real Insta.

815
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,295
[Trevor] Whipped wonderworld.

816
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,672
The secret ingredient is...

817
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,355
- Whipped cream?
- That's why it's the...

818
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,508
Yeah, I think you should...

819
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,134
- What?
- Yeah.

820
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,262
[Lucas] Okay...

821
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,640
Anywho, last ice cream sandwich.
You wanna split it?

822
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,723
Thanks.

823
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,435
Dude! Every time!

824
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,105
- Not into flip cup, huh?
- Like, ever.

825
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,649
Don't hate the player. Hate the game.

826
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,067
I just said I hate the game.

827
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,069
Okay. Spill it.

828
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,029
I just need a break.

829
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,323
From the contortions
of being someone's girlfriend.

830
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,075
Oh, no, what is he doing to you?

831
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,828
[giggling] No, it's not like that.
It's, like, mentally.

832
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,247
- All right. Go on.
- It's like this.

833
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,541
We're here and we're sharing
an ice cream sandwich.

834
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,667
And it's great.

835
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,270
But if Peter was here
and we were sharing an ice cream sandwich,

836
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,921
I don't know, I'd be thinking about...

837
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,383
has Peter shared an ice cream
sandwich with someone before?

838
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,594
And if he has, was it with Gen?

839
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,178
Does he think that I'm a prude

840
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,598
if I just wanna share
an ice cream sandwich?

841
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,599
Maybe it's me.

842
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,935
Maybe I'm the one who wants to do more
than just share an ice cream sandwich.

843
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,397
So the answer to all of those questions...

844
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,149
is... is I don't know.

845
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,484
Is this what happens in a girl's mind?

846
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,071
- That's what goes on in this girl's mind.
- Well, I am glad I am not you.

847
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,033
And not your ice cream.

848
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,242
So, back up.

849
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,785
[sighs]

850
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,626
- Hey, Lucas?
- Mm-hmm.

851
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,462
- Do you remember John Ambrose McClaren?
- Yeah.

852
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,630
Of course.

853
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,132
I was like obsessed with him
in the fifth grade.

854
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,719
Well, him and Michael B. Jordan in <i>Creed.</i>

855
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,845
[chuckles]

856
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,139
I was obsessed with him in sixth grade.

857
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,893
He's volunteering at Belleview with me.

858
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,520
Not that it means anything.

859
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,273
I'm perfectly happy
in my relationship with Peter.

860
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:16,111
It's just like the stuff that I was
telling you about, like the overthinking,

861
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,698
that doesn't happen
when I'm with John Ambrose.

862
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,033
It's, like, easy.

863
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,287
But that's probably because
we're just friends, right?

864
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,164
You're lucky, LJ.

865
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,125
- Lucky how?
- You have options.

866
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,380
There's like, what, two gay dudes
at our school?

867
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,549
I'm sorry.

868
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,427
I've been thinking about my own problems
and not even...

869
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,055
thinking about what you're going through.

870
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,224
[boy] Ah, come on!

871
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,350
Listen,

872
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,810
sooner than we think,

873
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,771
we're gonna be out of high school
and we're gonna be in the real world,

874
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,607
and guys are gonna be lining up for you.

875
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,027
And what makes you so sure?

876
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,405
'Cause before I knew you were gay,

877
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,032
I was first in line.

878
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,288
Well, that was one hell of a speech
just to get another bite.

879
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,415
[Lara Jean chuckles]

880
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,541
[call phone chimes]

881
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,218
Wait, hold up. Are you guys texting
each other when he's just 20 feet away?

882
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,719
Hey.

883
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,762
Wanna go?

884
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,181
Okay.

885
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,726
Bye, Lucas.

886
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,852
Mm-hmm.

887
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,896
Good night, you two.

888
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,440
- Yes, yes!
- [laughing]

889
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,156
- I didn't know you were friends.
- [Chris] No.

890
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,903
- Nothing to see here.
- Mm-mm.

891
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,864
- [Trevor] Leave.
- [Chris] Bye, LJ.

892
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,248
Hey.

893
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,251
You okay?

894
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,297
Just, you were a little quiet tonight.

895
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,007
Can I ask you something?

896
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,343
Yeah. Of course.

897
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,890
[sighs] It's about the...
the poem you wrote me.

898
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,897
I never said that <i>I...</i>

899
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,608
wrote... wrote it.

900
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,069
I'm sorry. Look, you were so happy

901
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:27,785
when I read it to you, that I...
I mean, I wished that I had written it,

902
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,996
and that I could actually write something
like that for you. I...

903
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,956
But you're the writer.

904
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,586
Are you mad?

905
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,172
No.

906
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,925
I love it.

907
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,428
That's good because
even if I didn't write it,

908
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,306
it's still how I feel about you.

909
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,644
Beautiful Lara Jean.

910
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,198
[Lara Jean] <i>Wow.</i>

911
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,450
<i>He's really good at this.</i>

912
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,870
<i>How is he so good at this?</i>

913
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,126
<i>And how does he know
how to do that so easily?</i>

914
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,047
How do you think?

915
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,467
You know what else he's really good at?

916
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,264
[whispering] Uh, I don't wanna have sex
with you right now.

917
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,348
Oh.

918
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,435
That's all right. I... I wasn't...

919
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,397
I wasn't trying to have sex
with you right now.

920
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,358
- I just... I want to put it out there.
- Okay.

921
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,776
Just in case...

922
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,737
Give me some credit, Covey.
I don't want to rush you.

923
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,033
Especially not in a parked car
in front of your house.

924
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,827
[both laugh]

925
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,831
Did you feel like I'm rushing you?

926
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,833
No. Uh... it's just...

927
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:02,671
Remember that story about me and Peter
upstairs at last year's graduation party?

928
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,007
No, it's just...

929
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,845
You and Gen used to do it a lot, right?

930
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,806
Can we... can we not...

931
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,850
talk about Gen?

932
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,894
Oh, it's not about Gen, it's, um...

933
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,896
Do you miss sex?

934
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,232
Is there a void in your life?

935
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,109
Is there a void? No.

936
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,568
No.

937
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,279
No, not... not at all.

938
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,741
[sighing]

939
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,702
Okay, think of it like this. Um...

940
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,079
You've been base jumping before.

941
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,874
And I've never,
I've never been base jumping,

942
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:43,253
so obviously, I would ask you about it
in case it's something that

943
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,505
I would ever want to... do.

944
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:52,804
I promise if you ever decide
to go base jumping

945
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,599
that I would love to go with you.

946
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,231
It's just a... It's a big decision...

947
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,526
to jump off a cliff, so...

948
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,655
remember that.

949
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:11,739
Yes.

950
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,950
Okay.

951
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,121
I'm gonna walk you to your door.

952
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,957
- Okay.
- Okay.

953
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,251
[John Ambrose]
Okay, are we all comfortable?

954
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,335
Everyone good?

955
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,712
- Yup,
- All right.

956
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,090
We have a very big prize this week.

957
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,092
It is a wheel of aged gouda

958
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:33,095
donated by Mrs. Glick's son.
Thank you so much.

959
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,389
- [applause]
- Draw already!

960
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,016
[chuckling] Okay. All right.

961
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,852
First number is...

962
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:43,772
B-4.

963
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,233
Don't think I've forgotten
you haven't returned my letter.

964
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,777
[Lara Jean] O-62.

965
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,239
John Ambrose, you're not getting
that back. Too embarrassing.

966
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,701
[John Ambrose] B-11.

967
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,327
You want embarrassing?

968
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,372
Try navigating sixth grade Shakespeare
with a stutter.

969
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,791
I don't remember that.

970
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,167
N-32.

971
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,754
G-48.

972
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,924
Fine. But even with a mild stutter,
you were still a hot commodity.

973
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,720
At sleepovers, girls used to say,
"Are you Team Peter or Team John?"

974
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,930
G-60!

975
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,351
Yeah, that's just the thing.

976
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,229
Girls pretended to like me

977
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,106
because I was friends with Peter.

978
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,649
I-24.

979
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,027
You remember the sixth grade
graduation dance?

980
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,114
I couldn't believe when Sabrina Fox
asked me to go with her.

981
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,240
Couldn't believe it.

982
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:39,286
But then she tried to dance with Peter
the whole night.

983
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,080
Even during the slow songs,
when I couldn't pretend

984
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,458
like we were just dancing in a group.

985
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,542
[woman] Hey!

986
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,461
Cut the chitchat.

987
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,087
Call the numbers.

988
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,051
[John Ambrose] I-25.

989
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,803
I can't wait to be at an age

990
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,514
where I'm not expected to think
that flip cup is fun.

991
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,809
Yeah, I mean, why do you think
we're both volunteering

992
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,145
and hanging out with the senior citizens
on a Saturday?

993
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,354
N-40.

994
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,148
Are we lame?

995
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,738
We might be a little bit. I-30.

996
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,743
But, lame in a cool way.

997
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,870
Totally lame in a cool way.

998
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,205
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

999
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,042
[chuckles] B-2?

1000
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,086
Whoo! I got BINGO.

1001
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,378
[all groaning]

1002
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,380
Suck it. [laughs]

1003
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,381
[gasps softly]

1004
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,050
[mouthing] Oh, my God.

1005
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,385
So, um, speaking of Peter Kavinsky,

1006
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,888
he told me to tell you
he says hi.

1007
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,306
Oh, cool.

1008
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,683
You guys still hang out.

1009
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,893
We do, actually.

1010
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,395
Is he... is he still like he was
in middle school?

1011
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,730
What does that mean?

1012
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:52,692
I mean like, okay, at parties and stuff,
he would always

1013
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,569
take the last slice of pizza.

1014
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,780
And then whenever you tried
to call him out on it,

1015
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,365
he'd be like, "I'm an athlete."

1016
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,449
[laughs]

1017
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,913
And that one time, it was my birthday
and you made me those amazing

1018
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,916
peanut butter chocolate cupcakes,
remember those?

1019
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,874
- Mm-hmm.
- So good.

1020
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,960
And he took the last one of those, too.

1021
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,797
But we never even got mad at him,
'cause he's so...

1022
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,966
Peter Kavinsky, you know?

1023
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,844
Yeah. I do know. Um...

1024
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,527
- And...
- Are he and Gen still together?

1025
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,514
- Huh?
- I mean, they must be,

1026
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,391
since you all still hang out.

1027
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,601
No, actually Gen and I
aren't really friends anymore

1028
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,478
and she and Peter broke up.

1029
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,396
Huh.

1030
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,568
That makes sense. No one really
stays together in high school, anyway.

1031
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,528
Right. And on that note,

1032
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,214
- I think I should tell you...
- [Dorothy] Oh!

1033
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,407
What a wonderful team you make.

1034
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,741
But this is wrong.

1035
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,577
All of the bingo stuff
goes in the basement.

1036
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,704
This needs to be cleared out
for the garden party.

1037
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,331
I have to go make some prune daiquiris.

1038
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,001
- Hey, Dorothy!
- Dorothy?

1039
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,159
Did you know there's a basement?

1040
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,724
[John Ambrose] Whoa.

1041
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,267
Oh, my gosh.

1042
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,027
Oh, there's a bust of Mozart over here.
I love his new album.

1043
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,110
[laughs]

1044
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,488
Hey.

1045
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,490
Look.

1046
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,497
Forget the stupid garden party
and the potted ferns. Like...

1047
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,709
I think we should give the people
what they want.

1048
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,921
An excuse to dress up
and dance like they used to.

1049
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,004
Yeah?

1050
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,477
I think we should bring back
the Star Ball.

1051
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:44,262
I think it's crazy that people think
all old people wanna do is play bingo.

1052
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,597
Yeah, totally.

1053
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,349
I think it's a great idea.

1054
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,060
- Cool. [chuckles]
- Although...

1055
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:56,441
to be fair, I do think that old people
just really love bingo for some reason.

1056
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,526
[laughs]

1057
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,610
Yeah.

1058
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,697
- Do you know what all this reminds me of?
- Hmm?

1059
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,241
Uh, the time capsule.

1060
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,451
Do you remember when we buried it?

1061
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,122
Uh, yeah, it was during
one of our pizza parties at the treehouse.

1062
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,290
The pizza parties...

1063
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,295
Man, we had such good times
at that treehouse.

1064
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,506
Just hanging, you know?

1065
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
Reading.

1066
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,573
There's something I need to tell you.

1067
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,783
What's up?

1068
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,123
Um... they are tearing the treehouse down.

1069
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,665
Why?

1070
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,919
The Robertsons are moving out

1071
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,505
and the new couple,
they don't have kids, so...

1072
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,464
The time capsule.

1073
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,008
We should dig it up.

1074
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,512
And rob future generations
of the discovery?

1075
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:11,599
Future generations are gonna have their
hands full with deforestation.

1076
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,101
Urban overcrowding.

1077
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,980
And we'll probably be living underwater
at that point, right? [chuckles]

1078
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,858
But it could be fun for us.

1079
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,445
What do you think?

1080
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,781
Yeah, um, that's a great idea.

1081
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,701
And we can invite the other people
that were there when we buried it.

1082
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,870
Yeah.

1083
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,457
Yeah, totally. We'll...
We can invite everybody.

1084
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,166
It'd be great.

1085
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,419
I'll bring the pizza.

1086
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,796
Maybe you can make those

1087
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,215
peanut butter chocolate cupcakes?

1088
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:51,014
What makes the octopus's
pulmonary system unique

1089
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:55,352
is it has not one, but three hearts.

1090
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,229
Make an incision underneath the ocellus

1091
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,150
and you will see the branchial heart.

1092
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:06,112
The octopus is a mollusk
and we will get to see one of those

1093
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,532
during next week's visit
to the Portland Aquarium.

1094
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,785
- Mm-mmm.
- Okay, here. I got this.

1095
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,954
So what are you doing
this Friday? Are you free?

1096
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,498
Uh, I'm not sure.

1097
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,707
Um, why?

1098
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,811
Do you remember the time capsule
that we buried in middle school?

1099
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,504
- Mm-hmm.
- We should dig it up.

1100
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,547
Just us?

1101
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,802
Uh, no, the other people that...
that we buried it with.

1102
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,595
- So, Gen?
- No.

1103
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,264
I'm not inviting Gen.
She posted that video of us.

1104
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,743
Well, we don't know for sure
that she did that anyway, right?

1105
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,978
Well, I don't even think she'd come
even if we invited her, so...

1106
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:42,482
It would be me, you, Chris,

1107
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,443
Trevor, and John Ambrose.

1108
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,155
So you... you, um. wrote him back.

1109
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,075
Funny story, um...

1110
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,911
we're actually volunteering
at Belleview together.

1111
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,329
- No way.
- Yeah.

1112
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,497
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1113
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,418
Did you ask him to volunteer with you?

1114
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,170
- No, I didn't even write him back.
- Huh.

1115
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:08,007
Jeez, Covey, for a girl
who's never had a boyfriend,

1116
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,552
you sure know how to mess with a guy.

1117
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,345
[chuckles softly] Excuse me?

1118
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,808
Time capsule.
Yeah, let's do it, what the hell?

1119
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,352
We don't know what we'll find, right?

1120
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,603
Cool.

1121
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,191
Watch.

1122
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,276
- No, no.
- Watch it.

1123
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,569
- Please, I...
- Watch it.

1124
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,570
Jesus...

1125
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,864
["It Hurts" by Bad Bad Hats playing]

1126
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,124
[Kitty] Chocolate peanut butter cupcakes?

1127
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,002
Peter prefers salted caramel.

1128
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,047
[exhales]

1129
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,693
[John Ambrose] Lara Jean.

1130
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,986
[Lara Jean] Hey.

1131
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,031
Two pepperoni pizzas!
That's probably enough, right?

1132
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,117
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Johnny McClaren!

1133
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,494
[John Ambrose] Peter Kavinsky.

1134
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,745
Hey, man.

1135
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,645
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1136
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,225
- How you doing?
- Good, you get pizzas?

1137
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,627
- What kind?
- Yeah, pepperoni, just two pepperoni.

1138
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,711
It's the safest.

1139
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:30,173
[Lara Jean]<i> I didn't realize until
I saw them standing next to one another</i>

1140
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,842
<i>what a spectacularly bad idea this was.</i>

1141
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,178
Yo! You guys ordered 'za?

1142
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,180
God, I am so hungry!

1143
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:38,890
- John!
- Yeah.

1144
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,141
- You made it.
- Yeah.

1145
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,101
Dude, I can't believe you made it, man.

1146
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,185
It's been so long!

1147
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:47,106
Yeah, well, I mean, LJ and I
planned the thing, so...

1148
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,376
- Glad you could come.
- Now we're just waiting for Chris.

1149
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,277
So I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail?

1150
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,197
Oh, my God. It's Gen and Peter!
Just like old times.

1151
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,120
We doin' this or... or what?

1152
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,582
Why are you, uh, comin' from the river?

1153
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,626
I just buried a dead body.

1154
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,835
Yeah, you're next!

1155
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,547
- Whoa, okay, calm down, Chris.
- [Chris laughing]

1156
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,882
- Let me take this. You got it.
- Oh, thank you.

1157
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,718
My shovel.
I don't trust you with this thing.

1158
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:19,264
- Remember where we buried this thing?
- Um, you need some help?

1159
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,140
No, we're good, dude. Thank you.

1160
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,475
[Trevor] It's about here, yeah?

1161
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,607
[metal clanks]

1162
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,502
[Peter] That's not how you eat a cupcake.

1163
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,462
[Trevor] No, look at that!
She ate it from the bottom up.

1164
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,905
[Chris] You know what?
She's saving the best for last!

1165
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,156
That's the way to do it.

1166
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,033
- [laughter]
- It just felt right.

1167
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,371
Hey. Why didn't you ask me
to bring the pizza?

1168
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,958
All right, let's bust this bad boy open!

1169
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,460
Starting with yours truly.

1170
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,879
La, la, la... Oh.

1171
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,506
- Who put this in?
- I did.

1172
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,424
It's just a bracelet.

1173
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,509
It's not just a bracelet, I mean,

1174
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,554
that piece of string was
the most valuable thing in your life.

1175
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:00,680
I guess.

1176
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,349
Baseball.

1177
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,311
- I am guessing you put that in.
- Yeah, that was me.

1178
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,233
This is when I hit a home run
at Claremont Park.

1179
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,608
Wait, I remember that!
You came running off the field

1180
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,794
and then you kissed me
in front of your mom. Remember that?

1181
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,487
Uh, no. No, I don't remember that.

1182
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,659
[Trevor] All right. Yep, that's mine.

1183
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:26,039
Ah, yes, the Linkin Park concert
at the Crystal Ballroom.

1184
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,291
- [Chris scoffs] Linkin Park? Nerd.
- What?

1185
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,209
Linkin Park slaps.

1186
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,169
Oof.

1187
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,881
Hey, McClaren, remember this? This is when
you hopped on the bandwagon,

1188
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,717
- and wore this hat every single day.
- Oh, my God.

1189
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,094
Wait, Lara Jean, didn't you get
a Seahawks T-shirt

1190
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,013
'cause you were trying to impress John?

1191
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,431
Uh, no.

1192
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,975
If that's true,
that's really cute. [chuckles]

1193
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,855
Hey, uh, McClaren,
remember when you had that stutter?

1194
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,357
[Trevor coughs]

1195
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,152
No... I just, I noticed you
don't have it anymore.

1196
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,291
Yeah, well, dude, thank you.
Appreciate it.

1197
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,365
I'm sure that my speech therapist

1198
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,743
would love to know that her methods
were successful. [chuckling]

1199
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,826
It's all good.

1200
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,085
This is to future Chris.

1201
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,545
Well, that's me. [laughs]

1202
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,798
Whoa. Ha!

1203
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,509
Genius then...

1204
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,969
genius now.

1205
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,137
Uh...

1206
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,261
I don't know about that. I think a genius
would know the time value of money.

1207
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:29,060
You know how like a 20 dollar bill now
is actually worth less

1208
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,687
than it was six years ago.

1209
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,105
- You really got me.
- I know.

1210
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,399
Mm-hmm. You're the last one left.
What's inside?

1211
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,776
Um, well, it's empty.

1212
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,859
Impossible. You put something in there.
We all did.

1213
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:42,115
Well, I don't really know what to tell you
because there's nothing in there.

1214
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,409
Uh, does anyone want the last slice?

1215
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,660
Too slow.

1216
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,666
- What?
- It's getting too crowded in here.

1217
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,251
- [Trevor] Same.
- Yeah, I'm out.

1218
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,628
I can stick around and help you
clean up if you want.

1219
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,047
- I got it.
- [John Ambrose] Oh, dude,

1220
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,426
it's cool. I mean, I kinda helped make
the mess. But it's fine, I don't mind...

1221
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,929
No, man. I think I can handle
helping my girlfriend clean up.

1222
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,266
Thank you, though.

1223
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,520
I'll go down. You wanna hand me stuff?

1224
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:13,604
Okay.

1225
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,064
I'll see you tomorrow.

1226
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:16,858
Sure.

1227
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,489
Why didn't you tell McClaren
that you and I are together?

1228
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,093
Well, I wanted to. I tried to.
There just was never a good time.

1229
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,202
Yeah, there's usually not,
when you're flirting.

1230
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,371
Well, we weren't flirting. So...

1231
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,332
Well, next time you need pizza,
just ask me. I'll get it for you.

1232
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,084
What is it with you and pizza?

1233
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,544
It's not about pizza.

1234
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,505
If he brings the pizza then it looks like
you two threw the party.

1235
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,965
It sort of was.

1236
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,217
You can't do that, Lara Jean.

1237
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,511
Not when you have a boyfriend.
Doesn't look right.

1238
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,387
Oh, right.

1239
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,515
So, like, inviting your ex-girlfriend
to your current girlfriend's party.

1240
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,977
I did not invite her!
Like, officially. I...

1241
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,730
- I might've mentioned it.
- Oh, yeah? When?

1242
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,733
I don't know.

1243
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,652
Why does it matter?
You're the one who arranged the pizza.

1244
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:05,114
- Okay, we're going around in circles.
- Well, it's not supposed to be like this.

1245
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,326
- Then, how's it supposed to be?
- I don't know. Not like this though.

1246
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,579
Does that mean you wanna break up?

1247
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,918
Wait, what? No! Why would you say that?

1248
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,002
I don't know.

1249
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:21,589
Is that why you didn't tell John about us?
So you'd keep your options open?

1250
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,424
No! That's not the reason at all.

1251
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,303
Okay, fine! Ever since we started dating
for real, I don't know how to act.

1252
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,055
I didn't read the girlfriend's handbook.

1253
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,058
Girlfriend's handbook?
Uh... what does that mean?

1254
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,938
Like, little stuff. Like I remember Gen
used to dress up for your games.

1255
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,062
- Am I supposed to do that?
- It's not just Gen.

1256
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,022
Okay, all the girlfriends do that.

1257
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,690
Okay, so, do you want me to?

1258
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:42,068
I mean, no, not if you don't want to.

1259
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,862
It would be nice,
it would show that you care.

1260
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,865
Oh, like sending a serenade to someone
on Valentine's Day, maybe?

1261
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,701
I... I didn't think that was your style.
I mean... [sighs]

1262
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:51,953
Well, it's not my style.

1263
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,454
Okay, so...

1264
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,265
Let's never fight again, okay?

1265
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,727
[softly] Okay.

1266
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:17,854
I got this.

1267
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,281
This way.

1268
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:43,462
[piano playing faintly]

1269
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,184
[playing soulful song]

1270
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,214
You have quite the ability
to remain sneakily silent.

1271
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,472
I know I should've told you
about me and Peter.

1272
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,685
It's okay.

1273
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:42,730
Lara Jean, I...

1274
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,650
I was just embarrassed.

1275
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,945
'Cause I... I read it all wrong.

1276
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,072
[softly] No.

1277
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,699
It's totally my fault.

1278
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,452
I'm sorry.

1279
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:13,844
Since we're, um...
Since we're coming clean

1280
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,805
about stuff...

1281
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,265
You know how you call me John Ambrose?

1282
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,559
Everyone calls you that.

1283
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,186
I know.

1284
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,563
It's because of you.

1285
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,733
What?

1286
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:34,657
Before sixth grade, pretty much everybody
called me John.

1287
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:38,244
And then I met you,
and you called me John Ambrose

1288
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:44,166
and said how it was cool that we both
went by our first and middle names.

1289
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,295
I didn't wanna correct you,

1290
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:51,757
I liked how we had something in common.

1291
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,970
So I started telling people
to call me John Ambrose.

1292
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:02,935
Wow.

1293
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,604
I don't know what to say.

1294
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,406
Are we good, John...

1295
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,491
Ambrose?

1296
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:18,617
[chuckles softly]

1297
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,246
We've always been good.

1298
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,913
Lara...

1299
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,623
Jean.

1300
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,715
[plays quicker]

1301
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,341
[laughs]

1302
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,605
[Lara Jean]
Are we doing Brussels sprouts this year?

1303
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,648
Ah, nobody really ate them last year.

1304
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:53,027
Kitty says Fakesgiving's
all about the potatoes anyway.

1305
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,112
Okay. Then, I think we're good.

1306
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,657
On second thought,
I'll get us some Brussels.

1307
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,659
- Hi.
- What you doing?

1308
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,994
[Trina] You know, just...

1309
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,663
making a soup.

1310
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,290
- What you got there?
- [giggles]

1311
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:10,336
- Ah, these are good.
- Yes, yeah, those are... those...

1312
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,964
[Lara Jean]
<i>I'd never seen my dad with a crush.</i>

1313
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,841
<i>But, there he was,</i>

1314
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,386
<i>laughing nervously with his hands
in his pockets.</i>

1315
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,348
<i>He looks a little...</i>

1316
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:23,973
<i>hopeless.</i>

1317
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:27,895
- Hi.
- Hi.

1318
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:31,482
I was supposed to get some
Brussels sprouts but I got distracted...

1319
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:33,275
- uh... for our...
- Ah. I see.

1320
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,194
- Fakesgiving.
- Fakesgiving.

1321
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,949
It's like regular Thanksgiving,
but it's in March,

1322
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,200
it's a family tradition.

1323
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,618
Oh, my God, that's so fun.

1324
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:43,911
You should come.

1325
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,787
[Dan] Yeah.

1326
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,749
Oh, well, I-I don't wanna...

1327
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,878
You don't wanna wait
till November for turkey.

1328
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:53,963
[laughs]

1329
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,798
[Dan] Right? You wanna come?

1330
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,383
- Yeah, count me in.
- Okay.

1331
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,136
I'll, uh, I'll text ya the deets.

1332
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,428
[giggling] Okay.

1333
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,390
- No one says that.
- That's some nice lingo. [clears throat]

1334
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,475
- I'm glad you're coming.
- Me too.

1335
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,519
But there's something
that I should tell you.

1336
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,689
You know that valentine that Dad sent you?

1337
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,400
Kitty made that.

1338
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:17,194
Wait, so you're telling me
that the valentine

1339
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,030
that was addressed to Mrs. Rothschild
in glitter glue...

1340
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,031
[laughing]

1341
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,116
...wasn't from your Dad?

1342
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:24,577
Well, that is a plot twist.

1343
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,704
[laughs]

1344
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,914
Wait, did Dad get Brussels sprouts?

1345
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,041
He did not get the Brussels sprouts.

1346
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,084
[Lara Jean] Dad.

1347
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:35,462
[Dan] What?

1348
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,714
- Get more.
- Okay.

1349
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,215
- That's not enough.
- Okay.

1350
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,177
[indistinct chatter]

1351
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,637
[Trina] Mm-hmm.

1352
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,390
[Dan] All right.

1353
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,934
Is something wrong with the green beans?

1354
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,145
Uh, they're just a little un-Covey.

1355
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:55,024
No? I mean everything else
on the table looks like it could be

1356
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,942
in one of my mom's
food and wine magazines.

1357
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,666
- He noticed.
- [Dan] He's got a good eye.

1358
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,336
It's silly, we do a little thing
where I get a can of green beans.

1359
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,992
No, it's symbolic.
I mean, it's kind of, um, for Mom.

1360
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:07,661
Okay, it sounds like there's
a story there.

1361
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,163
Is there a story?

1362
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:14,752
Oh, when I was in college, I got invited
to a Thanksgiving party in a dorm room.

1363
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,671
But the weird thing is,
it was the middle of March,

1364
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:21,926
and the girl hosting it
was the coolest girl I ever saw.

Evie, their mom.

1366
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:28,515
And she thought it was unfair
that the two best holidays of the year

1367
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:31,560
were at the end of the year,
right on top of each other and

1368
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,979
we should just spread the love
a little bit

1369
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,023
and have a potluck for good ol' March.

1370
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:39,693
Right, and at that potluck,
when everyone made homemade goods,

1371
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,278
Dad brought

1372
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,256
- canned green beans.
- Canned green beans.

1373
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,615
- Right.

1375

She made so much fun of me,
I thought she was really mad at me.

1376
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:52,126
But after, her roommate told you that
that's just how she flirts, right?

1377
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,166
See, she teases you.

1378

- Is that...
- Nope.

- Yeah, thanks.

1383

Oh, there's one other tradition.

1384
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,806
Yes. Newcomers have to eat the beans.

1385

- Oh, it is very necessary.
