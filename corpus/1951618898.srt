1
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,664
What are you thinking about?

2
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,535
I was just thinking how convenient
it is for me that it's considered hip

3
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,635
to drive a $20,000 hybrid.

4
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:55,909
Dork.

5
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,951
And how lucky I am that you love me.

6
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,677
I love you, too, babe.

7
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,833
<i>I'm 29 years old. I'll be 30 next month.</i>

8
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:22,998
<i>When I was a kid, I used to close
my eyes and try to picture myself at 30,</i>

9
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,770
<i>and this is what I saw.</i>

10
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,609
<i>A great job, still best friends
with the guys I grew up with,</i>

11
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,115
<i>and in love with a beautiful girl.</i>

12
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,750
<i>So far, I gotta say
that my life has turned out</i>

13
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,151
<i>pretty much exactly
the way I imagined it.</i>

14
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,354
We have something to tell you.

15
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,453
We have something to tell you.

16
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,050
- You're getting...
- A baby.

17
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,258
- A baby?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,127
Oh, my God!

19
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,263
How did you do that?

20
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,357
Well...

21
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,870
- I'm 10 weeks.
- You are 10... Oh, my...

22
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,302
- Fabulous!
- Ten weeks.

23
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,433
- Oh, yay, yay!
- Congratulations, Michael.

24
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,943
Fantastic.

25
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:02,104
Sweetheart, champagne!
I'm overwhelmed.

26
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,615
All right. Champagne.

27
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,010
Let's get some champagne.
Let's drink a toast. Oh, my...

28
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,749
- Honey, where's the champagne?
- It's in the bar, under the sink.

29
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,485
Now, you can't have any champagne,
but we can drink for you.

30
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,719
We're very good at that.

31
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:15,851
All right, I'll be right back.

32
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,123
Don't say another word, please,
until I'm here.

33
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,291
- So, what do you think?
- Well, I think it's a...

34
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,694
It's a very big thing.

35
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,100
Traditionally, not the first big thing
of your adult life.

36
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,105
We've talked about
getting married before.

37
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,435
We just...

38
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,940
You know,
Michael's been so busy working,

39
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,773
and I'm in the middle of my dissertation,
and it just...

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,210
I don't know, it feels weird now.

41
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,181
We don't want people thinking
we're getting married 'cause we have to,

42
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,513
- because that's not why we would.
- Nobody will think that.

43
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,881
Remember Lucy's wedding?

44
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,614
Oh, honey, please.

45
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,153
That girl's a slut.
She completely trapped that guy.

46
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,351
Case in point.

47
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,724
No one's gonna think that about you.

48
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,057
Open this, darling.

49
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,324
It's warm!

50
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,059
Well, of course it's warm.
We never drink it.

51
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,930
If I open this, it's going to explode.

52
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,730
It's all right.
Just live on the edge, Stephen.

53
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,997
Open the bottle.

54
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,335
Open the bottle because
I'm a grandmother,

55
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,636
- and I want to celebrate!
- Okay, here we go!

56
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,438
Come on, get it while it's hot.

57
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,312
- Hooray, hooray.
- That's for you.

58
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,044
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my...

59
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,382
- No, just a little, Dad.
- It's the last drink you're gonna have.

60
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,687
All right.
To my little girl and her little boy.

61
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,956
- Or girl.
- Or girl. I was going to say that.

62
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,123
And here's to the young man
who's responsible for the whole thing.

63
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,066
Who's feeling more responsible
by the second.

64
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,261
Quite right.

65
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,929
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

66
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,972
<i>If you have to settle down,</i>

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,241
<i>if you absolutely have to
become an adult,</i>

68
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,147
<i>and have a baby
and all that comes with it,</i>

69
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,521
<i>this is the kind of woman
you want to do it with.</i>

70
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,090
<i>You couldn't ask for a better girl.</i>

71
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,352
Your cousin stayed fat.

72
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,954
Tricia was enormous
to begin with, baby.

73
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,728
She grew to the size of a parade balloon
when she was pregnant

74
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,167
but then she went back
to being a regular fat-ass.

75
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,967
The point is, she's a fatter ass now
than she was before.

76
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,770
And, you know, she's always dieting.

77
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,242
She talks about dieting.

78
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,334
If you look in her purse,

79
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,073
it looks like
she just went trick-or-treating.

80
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,443
You're cruel.

81
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,979
I am going to be fat and ugly.

82
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:24,051
Baby, no matter how fat you get,
you could never be ugly.

83
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,150
And as long as I can find these
perfect breasts amidst all the rolls,

84
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,250
I'll be happy.

85
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,590
And this ass!

86
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,257
- You have the greatest ass in the world!
- Wait, wait!

87
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,233
So when it's large,
it'll just be that much greater!

88
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,203
- Come on! What? I can't hear you!
- Stop! Stop it!

89
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,932
I can't hear you!

90
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,438
You are so pathetic.

91
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,610
Oh, my God, why? Why?
What did I do to deserve this?

92
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,978
You're just an incredibly lucky woman.

93
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,247
Will you start eating with me, big boy?

94
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,445
- Yeah, we'll go pickle for pickle.
- Promise?

95
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,318
Yeah, I'll bring my cousin over.
We can snack on her belly.

96
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,685
Don't. That's gross.

97
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,692
- That's Izzy. I gotta go.
- No, don't. No.

98
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,189
Don't go.

99
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,430
Are you going to be really late?

100
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,829
No, because I have plans
for your boobies later.

101
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:08,923
I don't want you to know.

102
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,297
I'm gonna tell them privately.
Don't listen.

103
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,427
Okay.

104
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,199
Okay, we'll talk later.
No, you can't. Okay, bye.

105
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,569
I heard.

106
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,242
Honey,

107
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,244
does it bother you at all
that we didn't plan this?

108
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,211
That it just happened?

109
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,540
What are you talking about? Not at all.

110
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,118
It's gonna be great.

111
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,883
- Really?
- Yeah.

112
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,490
If you got him strippers,
I'm going to have to take you down.

113
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,031
Come on, Jenna.
You know I'm not into that.

114
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,274
Where did you find them?

115
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,532
It's your wedding, man.

116
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,771
Like your brothers
are gonna let you down.

117
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,313
So beautiful.

118
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,852
Oh, fuck.

119
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,526
- You all right, man?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

120
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,391
It's okay, man. Let it out, buddy.

121
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,088
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, fine.

122
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,496
- No, no. He's fine.
- He does this all the time.

123
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,866
It's very hard for him, you know,
because his mother was a lesbian,

124
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,337
and she passed away very recently.

125
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,601
You guys should just keep going.

126
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,142
You gotta push through
because what you're doing is beautiful.

127
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,643
I'm fine. I'm all right.

128
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,577
- Come on, let's take a little break.
- No, no.

129
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,206
We'll take a little break.
Let's go outside, we'll get a little air.

130
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,150
Okay? Girls, back to work.

131
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,721
- I'm sorry. Don't mind me.
- Careful, don't slip on the ass beads.

132
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,916
Step over them. There we go.

133
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,529
I just loved knowing, you know?

134
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,702
Like, I saw my whole life laid out
in front of me. Perfect.

135
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:57,064
And then that bitch just yanked it all
away from me.

136
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,803
Just...

137
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,945
You know? It's like...

138
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,677
Of course, you know.

139
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,153
You and Jenna
are like the same person.

140
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,648
- Now you're having a baby?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,020
- How intense is that?
- Pretty intense.

142
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,696
I envy you, you prick.

143
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,029
I quit the cheese company.

144
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,867
What?

145
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,611
Dude, isn't your dad still in the hospital?

146
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,343
I just can't do it anymore, man.

147
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,353
I told my Uncle Gary.
I gave him my notice on Friday.

148
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,286
He kind of freaked on me.

149
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,652
I'll bet.

150
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:50,193
- I told him I'm taking a road trip.
- You're taking a road trip?

151
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,989
Wow. Where you going, buddy?
Six Flags?

152
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,726
Tierra del Fuego.

153
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,795
On a motorcycle.

154
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,332
But you get nauseous
when you leave the ZIP code.

155
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,137
Exactly.

156
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,712
...find the happiness
that has eluded your mother and me.

157
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,079
To Eva and Mark!

158
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:11,876
To Eva and Mark!

159
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,813
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

160
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,752
- Eva and Mark!
- Eva and Mark!

161
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,751
I'm overwhelmed

162
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,925
by this miracle

163
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,291
that has happened to me.

164
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,731
And as happy as I am
to see all of you at my wedding,

165
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,837
I'm happiest to see her.

166
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,772
Isn't she beautiful?

167
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,446
She's nothing compared to you.

168
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,880
- Did I get my own "aw"?
- You did.

169
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,878
Thank you so much for coming.

170
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,115
We are both overwhelmed.

171
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,320
Oh, no.

172
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,259
I'll be back.

173
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,489
2 o'clock.

174
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,610
- Thought she wasn't coming.
- I know. You think he's seen her yet?

175
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,976
Probably.

176
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,612
- Can we talk to you for a second?
- All of you?

177
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,588
Arianna, what are you doing here?
You know he's gonna go crazy.

178
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,284
What do you want me to do, Chris?
Hide under a rock?

179
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,384
No, but a little sensitivity might be nice.

180
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,484
He's a wreck, Ari.

181
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,995
Come on, we're asking you.
Don't do this.

182
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,464
Do what? I'm not doing anything.

183
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,792
Shit.

184
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,937
What are you doing here?

185
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,439
They're my friends, too.

186
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,872
Have another drink, Izzy.

187
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,102
Ari.

188
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:46,669
Ari!

189
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,107
There are, like, 500 people here.

190
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,547
If you can't stand the sight of me,
just ignore me.

191
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,312
Can't stand the...

192
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,548
Hey, hey!
I am trying to start over here, okay?

193
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,619
How am I supposed to do that
if you keep popping up everywhere?

194
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,287
Izzy, I'm moving on with my life.
You should do the same.

195
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,195
How can you be so blind? Look at this!
This should've been us.

196
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,826
That's what you always wanted,
ever since you were 16 years old.

197
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,030
That's what you always wanted with me.

198
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,233
You better get him out of here.

199
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,305
Oh, fuck.

200
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,539
- I took you to your fucking prom!
- No, no, no.

201
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,912
I took that bitch to her fucking prom!

202
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,542
- Come on. You sound like an asshole.
- She's totally not worth it.

203
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,053
I know, I know.
I'm so over that fucking girl.

204
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,753
I'll be back!

205
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:47,565
You're dancing. You're dancing.
You're rocking the salsa beat.

206
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,005
Come on. Hey.

207
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,742
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing. He was fine until...

208
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,180
He's not fine. He's scared.

209
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,273
He's not scared.

210
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,943
Is that why he's screaming, then, Chris?

211
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,318
He's screaming
'cause he saw you coming down the...

212
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,950
That's great.

213
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,026
Why don't you just stay here
and have a good time?

214
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,389
Relax. I'll go change him.

215
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,019
Give me a break.

216
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,462
Lisa. Wait up.

217
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,837
How much longer
am I supposed to put up with this?

218
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,389
What are you drinking?

219
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,019
I'm trying to decide
how drunk I want to be.

220
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,232
I think I'll go with a beer, please.

221
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,962
Yeah, could I have one, too? Thanks.

222
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,900
Have we met before?

223
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,470
Do I look familiar?

224
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,068
No.

225
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,274
- Okay, I'm Kim.
- Michael.

226
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,906
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

227
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,777
- So, are you a friend of the groom's?
- Since preschool, actually.

228
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,123
- That's really cute.
- Yeah. Blocks.

229
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,760
Can you just excuse me?

230
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,858
Hello.

231
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,230
Yeah, I'm coming. Right now.

232
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,028
Bye.

233
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,671
I'm with three friends that have wanted
to leave since we got here.

234
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,944
Would you wait? I'll be right back.

235
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,944
It's true.

236
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,112
Every single one of my friends
are married.

237
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,621
It's like they're all in a cult,

238
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,691
and completely obsessed
with me joining.

239
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,990
They're like, "If you don't get married
soon, you'll be too old to have a baby. "

240
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,065
Guess what?
I don't want to have a baby.

241
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,466
I certainly don't think I should be bullied
into it just because I have a vagina.

242
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,405
- I'm Ken.
- Danielle.

243
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,809
Isn't this fantastic?

244
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,709
Yeah. It's pretty crazy, huh?

245
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,809
It's like a little condominium
or something.

246
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,046
Yeah.

247
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,821
Mind if I...

248
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,257
Yeah, please.

249
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,393
So do you have a girlfriend?

250
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,598
Yeah.

251
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:12,004
A little hesitation there.
Having a crisis, are we?

252
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,842
- Do I look like I'm having a crisis?
- Everyone I know is having a crisis.

253
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,416
I know you're not supposed
to get them until mid-life, but

254
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,781
I think something's happened
to our metabolisms.

255
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,478
Our metabolisms?

256
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,250
Yeah, I mean,
the world is moving so fast now

257
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,416
and we're all chasing something so fast

258
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,654
that we start freaking out
way before our parents did.

259
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,897
Feel my heart.

260
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,366
Feel how fast it is?

261
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,140
That's a fast heart.

262
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,444
Because we don't ever stop
to breathe anymore.

263
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,342
You gotta remember to breathe,
or you'll die.

264
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,242
Oh, sorry.

265
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,548
- Hey!
- Hey.

266
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,122
Have you seen Michael anywhere?

267
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,281
No.

268
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,118
Okay. Carry on.

269
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,989
And don't worry, because crises...

270
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,567
Crisises?

271
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,727
I think it's "crises. " Go with "crises. "

272
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,532
Right. Like I said,

273
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,530
crises, well, they come and go.

274
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,040
Sometimes.

275
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,746
Sometimes they don't really feel like
they're going anywhere.

276
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,340
- You're having a permanent crisis?
- I don't know. Maybe.

277
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,751
I've just been thinking
about my life lately and

278
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,725
everything feels pretty planned out.

279
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,088
You know?

280
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,758
It's like I know everything
that's going to happen.

281
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,624
There are no more surprises.

282
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,894
- That is so boring.
- I know.

283
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,938
- So what do you do?
- Complain, I guess.

284
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,339
No, like, what do you...
Like, what do you do?

285
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,781
Oh, you mean "what do I do"
what do I do?

286
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,217
- Yeah.
- Sorry. I'm an architect.

287
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,014
How about you?

288
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,716
- I'm a musician.
- Oh, cool.

289
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,486
- A flautist.
- Oh, real cool.

290
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,427
Yeah. I mean, I study other things, too.
I'm not an idiot.

291
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,464
But, if I could do anything,

292
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:17,262
I would love to be able to do that
when I finish school.

293
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,533
You're graduating this year?

294
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,837
Two more years. Wow.
Look at you. Two more years.

295
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,102
Yeah.

296
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:30,008
Well, don't rush it.
College was the best time of my life.

297
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,106
Reminiscing already, huh?

298
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,751
I should get back.

299
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,953
- To your crisis?
- My crisis awaits.

300
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,224
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

301
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,626
Okay.

302
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,958
Careful. I'll help you up.

303
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,311
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

304
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,408
Yeah?

305
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,717
- I guess that's a cool tree, huh?
- Yeah, I like that tree.

306
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,516
All right, well,

307
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,754
there are my friends,
so I guess I'll see you around?

308
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,693
Yeah. Cool.

309
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,023
Cool.

310
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,996
Do you, like, want my phone number
or something?

311
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,100
Yeah. That'd be good.

312
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,004
Yeah?

313
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,541
Do you have a pen?

314
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,906
No.

315
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,280
Well, if you want to
come by campus sometime,

316
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,881
I get out at 5:00 on Monday,
Wednesdays and Fridays.

317
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,723
I usually meet my friends
at the Terrace.

318
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,421
Sure.

319
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,425
Okay.

320
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,397
Bye.

321
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,510
Look at her.

322
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,886
Six weeks, and she's already
screwing somebody else.

323
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,350
Dude, ease up. He's obviously gay.

324
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,387
- What?
- He's gay.

325
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,600
Look at him.
No straight man looks that good.

326
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,100
You think?

327
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,670
Yeah. I mean,

328
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,936
you know, he doesn't look that good
to me, but he looks good.

329
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,413
Caught you!
You've been hiding from me.

330
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,075
No, I've been right here the whole time.

331
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,313
Don't worry.
You missed her throwing the garter belt.

332
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,015
Did you see
how beautiful Lisa's baby is?

333
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,318
He's beautiful.

334
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,384
You know, I thought I wanted a girl,
but now I think I want a boy.

335
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,930
- What do you want?
- A girl.

336
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,227
Me, too.

337
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,746
Okay, so why are you staring at me?

338
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,940
What would you do if I died?

339
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,149
Iron my dark suit.

340
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,715
Would you even notice if I was gone?

341
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,623
Trust me. I'd notice.

342
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,859
So, you'd do what?

343
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,361
Go out and get some young thing

344
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,300
that would sit here in silence and smile?

345
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,803
Do you have anybody in mind?

346
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,476
You know, the other day
I actually felt jealous

347
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,281
of my own daughter?

348
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,054
- Do you know why?
- I'm sure you're going to tell me.

349
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,556
The way Michael looked at her.

350
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,525
Did you see that?

351
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,964
- Anna, there is no point...
- Like he had to have her.

352
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,998
Just once I would like to know
what that's like. Just once.

353
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,832
Well, I do have to have you, darling.

354
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,676
It's a contractual thing.

355
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,182
Go ahead, crack another joke.

356
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,410
Jesus.

357
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,481
Oh, look.

358
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,023
Our bed just got more comfortable.

359
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,081
Chris!

360
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,685
Chris, what the hell are you doing?
You've been in there for 20 minutes!

361
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,288
- Just give me one minute.
- No! I have given you 20!

362
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,095
Now get out here and give me a hand!

363
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:48,036
Matthew is screaming, I have piss
all over me and I can't find any binkies.

364
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,352
- Who is it?
- It's Marvin from next door.

365
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,452
Your front porch is on fire!

366
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,602
- Hey. No, don't say anything.
- Get out.

367
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,502
I'm going crazy without you. I love you.

368
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,733
- I'm serious.
- I fucking love you.

369
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,332
Come on, look at you.
You're so beautiful.

370
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,502
I'm calling the police,
that's what I'm doing.

371
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,169
No, no, you're not.

372
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,769
- Give me the phone!
- No!

373
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:30,973
- Give me the phone!
- No!

374
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,983
Just listen to me for a second!

375
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,384
Look me in the eye and tell me
that you don't love me anymore.

376
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,547
I don't love you anymore.

377
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,524
- I refuse to accept that.
- Izzy, go home!

378
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,999
- You really want me to leave?
- Yes!

379
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,106
- That's what you're saying?
- That's what I'm saying.

380
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,601
Okay.

381
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,709
Ari,

382
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,717
I love you forever.

383
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,103
It's me. Open up.

384
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,145
I'm coming!

385
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,049
- You have to come with me.
- Where?

386
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,622
South America.

387
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,218
Okay.

388
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,622
I need a wingman, man.
I can't do this alone.

389
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,251
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

390
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,852
- Really?
- Yeah.

391
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,291
Hey, you got any ice?
I think I broke my hand.

392
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,858
You're not gonna believe this, Izzy,
but I actually keep ice in the freezer.

393
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,528
You're really coming with me?

394
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,606
No talking!

395
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,499
"During this trimester,

396
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,906
"women have to carefully inspect
the things they're feeling

397
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,707
"because hormonal changes
can make upsets and worries

398
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,179
"seem larger than they are. "

399
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,874
Tell me about it.

400
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,583
No, that's my nut.

401
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,815
"In isolation, one's anxieties
become disproportionate.

402
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,418
"Talking things out with your partner

403
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,152
"is a way of exorcising fears
on both sides

404
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,491
"or at least not allowing them
to become overwhelming. "

405
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,825
Did you get that?

406
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,427
It says you can't hold everything inside.

407
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,868
Yeah. So what about you?

408
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,767
- What?
- What are you holding inside

409
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,931
you feel like you want to let out?

410
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,502
What?

411
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,045
- What? You asked!
- Oh, my God!

412
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,615
- I've been holding that in all day!
- You're disgusting! Michael!

413
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,547
I don't want your farts on me.

414
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,119
Come on, turn the TV off. I'm serious.

415
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,382
I want to know what you're feeling.

416
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,819
I'm feeling that...

417
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,286
What I'm feeling, me,

418
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,826
is that, in general...

419
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,025
Wow. You are an enormous loser,
you know that?

420
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,160
Well, you're in love with a loser,
and only a loser could love a loser.

421
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,102
- Are you nine?
- Ten.

422
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,734
Okay, fine. I'll go.

423
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,142
I feel like we should buy a house.

424
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,151
You got to be fucking kidding me.

425
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,623
I'll get it!

426
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,993
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,859
What are you doing here?

428
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,527
Kenny's coming with me
to South America.

429
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,234
You're really serious about that?

430
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,635
Hell, yes.

431
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,038
- I should go with you.
- Yeah, right.

432
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,772
Lisa's driving me out of
my fucking mind. I can't take it anymore.

433
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,375
- Where's Kenny?
- He's...

434
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,486
You just got another promotion

435
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,580
and my parents can help
with the down payment.

436
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,283
I just don't think it's such a good idea.

437
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,486
Why? Their parents did it for them.

438
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,028
And you know,
a monthly mortgage payment

439
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,223
probably isn't that much more
than we're spending on rent.

440
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,856
It's not really about the money, Jenna.

441
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,527
Then what is it?
I wouldn't dare mention the M-word

442
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,833
because I know how any conversation
about that totally freaks you out.

443
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,306
I told you I'd marry you
when you could name three couples

444
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,570
you know personally that have lasted
more than five years.

445
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,579
Yeah, and I still only have my parents
and that cute couple from the pond.

446
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,809
- Ducks don't count.
- They mate for life, come on.

447
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,313
What is it, baby?

448
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,190
What are you afraid of?

449
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,955
I don't know. It just seems so, like,

450
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,392
final.

451
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,163
Final.

452
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,232
Wow. We're about to
become a family, Michael.

453
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,934
I know. I didn't mean it like that.

454
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,533
If you aren't up for this, tell me now,

455
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,613
- because otherwise, what are we doing?
- I am! I'm excited!

456
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,840
No one forced you into this.

457
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,643
You had the chance to tell me
in the beginning!

458
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,513
Will you calm down?
Your hormones are freaking out.

459
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,211
Oh, my God!
Don't blame this on my hormones.

460
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,582
You couldn't get more obvious.

461
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,020
I'm saying what your magazine said,
and we're doing it.

462
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,093
- Doing what?
- We're talking about how we feel.

463
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,663
- You're right.
- What?

464
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,499
I'm sorry, I couldn't...
I'm all the way over here.

465
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,402
I couldn't hear you very well.
What'd you say?

466
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,065
I said you were right.

467
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,507
Oh, I'm right.

468
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,243
Am I right?

469
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,479
You want to make a home with me,
right?

470
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,643
Yes.

471
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,347
- Because if you don't, that's fine.
- Look at me.

472
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,115
I do.

473
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,293
Good. Because if you didn't,
I'd have to kill you in your sleep.

474
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,963
- And that would just ruin everything.
- Yeah, that would suck.

475
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,066
I love you.

476
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,469
I love you.

477
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,335
I'm sorry.

478
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,112
She just makes
everything impossible, man.

479
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,488
It's like anything I try to do

480
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,990
makes her feel like she's losing control
of the baby.

481
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,219
Yeah.

482
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,458
Hey. What's up?

483
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,788
Nothing at the moment.

484
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,928
Are you going with Izzy?

485
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,798
- Where?
- To South America.

486
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,428
Oh, yeah. No.

487
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,803
What? You just said you were coming.

488
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,808
I know, buddy,
but my life is perfect here.

489
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,707
Why would I leave? Come on.

490
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,177
Hi. I'm Danielle.

491
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,406
See what I mean?

492
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,175
Hi, I'm Chris.

493
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,841
- Hi.
- We met at the wedding.

494
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,351
Yeah, hi. Yeah, we met at the wedding.

495
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,315
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I'm going to stop for a second here.

496
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,620
Excuse me,
how is your life here so perfect?

497
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,955
Can you just run that by me?

498
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,892
Because I remember
when you graduated,

499
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,657
you were gonna go save the Africans.

500
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,891
Save the children?

501
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,660
Whatever.
You were gonna go save them.

502
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,463
And now you're tending bar

503
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,561
and you're screwing a different girl
every other night?

504
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,799
What's funny about that
is you're at that bar more than I am.

505
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,375
And secondly, dude, I'm not screwing
a different girl every other night.

506
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,501
I'm just not.

507
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,704
Okay, you're right. It's every night.

508
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,441
- You're an asshole.
- What? It's better that she knows now.

509
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,538
It's better you know now.

510
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,912
He does what he wants,
I do what I want.

511
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,417
Jesus, do you hear that? She's perfect.

512
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,646
You're perfect. I'm in love with you.

513
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,881
Do you have a sister for him, maybe?

514
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,753
Yeah, I'm very happy for both of you,
but I'm offering you an opportunity here,

515
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,918
and you're gonna miss it,
you're gonna blow it.

516
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:26,053
Take a risk. Take a chance.
That's what you used to tell me.

517
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,756
When are we gonna get a chance
to do this again?

518
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,664
When we're 50,
on, like, some Norwegian Cruise

519
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,237
with these fat girls in floaties.

520
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,431
I'm telling you,
you're 29 years old, Kenny.

521
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,940
- I'm 28.
- No, you're 29.

522
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,236
Thank you.

523
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,109
Shit, I am.

524
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,676
Well, you're gonna be sitting
in that same chair in 20 years

525
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,310
and you're gonna be wondering,
"Why didn't I take this chance with Izzy?

526
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,877
"Why didn't I do something exciting
with my life

527
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,356
"instead of ice-fishing
on Lake Mendota?"

528
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,860
See, what you're not getting, Izzy,
is that I like ice-fishing.

529
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,489
Ice-fishing makes me happy. It does.

530
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,761
And don't come in here
and start editing my life

531
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,804
just 'cause you're not happy with yours.
Don't do it.

532
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,840
No, that's what you're doing.

533
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:10,941
No, that's what you're doing.

534
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,540
No, I was...

535
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,446
- Wait, where you going?
- I am going to put my blue balls to bed.

536
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,693
Good night.

537
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,611
Good night.

538
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,903
Good night.

539
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,675
- Night.
- Good night.

540
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,977
- I love you.
- Me, too, you.

541
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,228
So I was just thinking that if we move
the garage from where it currently sits,

542
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,663
there's no reason why this atrium

543
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,065
couldn't be pulled up
the entire height of the building.

544
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,659
So that way, it's the middle of winter,

545
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,535
and all these people get to look out
their window and see trees

546
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,232
and maybe even birds.

547
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,004
- What sorts of birds?
- Shut up, Ryan.

548
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,339
- Like, what species...
- Shut up, Ryan.

549
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,346
- Sorry.
- Dick.

550
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,842
- That's really interesting, Michael.
- Thank you.

551
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,613
I'm just a little concerned about cost.

552
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,022
What do you think, Chris?

553
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,290
I think I'm going to leave my wife.

554
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,862
- So, have you told her yet?
- No, not yet.

555
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,003
I don't know how
I'm going to do that, but...

556
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,866
I just know that I'm tired
of being told how much I suck.

557
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,504
Oh, man.

558
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,380
I thought if I had a kid with her,
it would bring us closer together.

559
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,009
Not make us want to kill each other.

560
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,155
I'm trapped, Mike.

561
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,985
I'm fucking trapped.

562
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,688
- Hey.
- Hey.

563
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,365
It's so funny, I was...

564
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,730
I was driving by and I remembered
that you said you hang out here.

565
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,462
Drive by here often?

566
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,232
- Thinking of becoming a flautist.
- Nice.

567
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,308
- I hear this is the place.
- Yeah. It's pretty good.

568
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,810
So you weren't coming here to see me?

569
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,971
I had a meeting.

570
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,011
- Do you want a ride? I have a car.
- I live really close.

571
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,144
I'll take you.

572
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:21,817
- Oh, no. Honestly, it's really close.
- I'll take you. I'll take you. Come on.

573
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,018
Okay.

574
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,694
- Well, it's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

575
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,062
- So, where am I going?
- Straight ahead.

576
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,736
So, what did you do
after I left the wedding?

577
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,328
Just, you know,
hung out with my friends and stuff.

578
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,169
Don't you love weddings?

579
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,436
Actually, no.
They make me pretty depressed.

580
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:42,138
- Why?
- I don't know. They just...

581
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,373
They always seem so forced to me,
you know?

582
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,881
I mean, if you love somebody,

583
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:49,680
why do you need a photo album
of drunk people in tuxedos to prove it?

584
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,085
Wow. How do you really feel?

585
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,559
Did you know that when
the institution of marriage was created,

586
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,289
people only lived to be 30 years old?

587
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,762
I'd be dying next year.

588
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,095
I would wear the hottest dress
to your funeral.

589
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,102
- I live here.
- Oh, here?

590
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,236
- Okay.
- Yeah.

591
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,075
- You do live close.
- I told you.

592
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,311
So, that whole day was like a nightmare
for you, huh?

593
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,716
All those relationships dissolving
before your eyes.

594
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,120
Well, it wasn't completely awful.

595
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,686
What are you doing
for the long weekend?

596
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,664
I mean, almost all my friends
are going out of town.

597
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,261
I don't know. I just was going to...

598
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,639
I don't know.

599
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,002
Do you want to go to a party with me?

600
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:54,943
Sure.

601
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,212
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

602
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,651
Okay, cool.

603
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,384
Here. Let me give you this.

604
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,154
- Nice pen.
- Thanks. I like purple.

605
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,963
- Don't even think about standing me up.
- Okay.

606
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,133
All right.

607
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,864
- Bye.
- See you.

608
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,613
<i>- Hey!
- Where are you?</i>

609
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,084
I called the office.
They said you weren't there.

610
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,862
I'm just on my way home.
Why? What's going on?

611
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,926
We have a sonogram. Did you forget?

612
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,592
Oh, my God. Jenna, I totally did.
I'm sorry. When?

613
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,033
<i>5:45. Get here soon.
We can still make it.</i>

614
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,469
Okay. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

615
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,905
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

616
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,202
What the fuck are you doing?

617
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:59,139
Holy shit. You are unbelievable.

618
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,552
There's more where that came from.

619
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,554
I just want to know,

620
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:09,757
where did I find you
and how do I make more of you?

621
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,730
- I have to go back to work.
- No, no!

622
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:19,770
Hang on.

623
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,800
What are you doing later?

624
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,469
You, hopefully.

625
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,677
Okay.

626
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,352
Be at my house at 8:00.

627
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,050
And stay hungry.

628
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,860
Oh, my God.

629
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,847
Now that I can see you,
it's as if I never left.

630
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,889
Oh, my God, if you only knew,
every day I've kicked myself.

631
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,248
I have, just,

632
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,023
every single day thinking about you.

633
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,859
- I thought of you, too.
- Oh, yeah. Liar.

634
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,535
I am so happy to see you.

635
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,267
- So why did you disappear?
- You know why.

636
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:33,507
I couldn't control the way
I felt about you. You know that.

637
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,273
You know. Listen.
I thought if I could stop cold,

638
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,974
and that's the only way I could do it,

639
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,619
maybe I could save my marriage.
Seriously.

640
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,889
- Did you save your marriage?
- No.

641
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,589
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,825
- Yeah.
- Anna, Anna.

643
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,728
I'm married.

644
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:58,596
- You are what?
- With a two-month-old baby boy.

645
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,871
- You can't be serious.
- Yeah, I'm serious.

646
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,002
- How old is your wife?
- What's the difference?

647
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,104
- Tell me. How old is she?
- No, it doesn't matter.

648
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,149
Tell me! How old is she?

649
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:14,979
She's 35 years old.

650
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,249
- My God, she could be my daughter.
- What's the difference?

651
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,120
You were never going
to leave him, anyway.

652
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,433
Be happy.

653
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,034
Anna.

654
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,334
God damn it, Anna!

655
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,874
- Is he here?
- Yes.

656
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,853
But he's with a patient.

657
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,584
Hello, dear.

658
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,318
- Anna, what's wrong?
- Nothing, as far as you're concerned.

659
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,195
Well, if you come back in 40 minutes...

660
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,391
I just wanted to let you know
I fucked another man.

661
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,395
Nice to see you.

662
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,639
Excuse me.

663
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,009
Anna, just...

664
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,079
Just come with me in here.

665
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,187
Oh, now you react.

666
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,689
Maybe if you'd dragged me into a closet
before, this wouldn't have happened.

667
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,388
- What the hell is going on?
- It was three years ago.

668
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,485
I saw him today.

669
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,498
He's leaving his wife
and he's going to run away with me.

670
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,568
That's all you need to know.

671
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,637
Anna, I understand
you want to lash out...

672
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,830
Just shut up!

673
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,636
Would you just, please, for God's sake,
shut up? I don't want to talk this out.

674
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,871
And I do not want your understanding.

675
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,247
I want someone who's flesh and blood.

676
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:58,019
And since you're not that,
I don't want you.

677
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,054
- ... fingers.
- You're obsessed.

678
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,524
<i>- Hello.
- I've left your father.</i>

679
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,659
What happened?

680
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,863
Nothing happened.
That's why I'm leaving him.

681
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,033
<i>- What? Mom...
- Honey, I want you to know that,</i>

682
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,711
that I'm so happy for you and the baby,

683
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,872
and I'm not jealous of you.

684
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,644
And if you need me, you call me,
all right?

685
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,844
I love you. I love you.

686
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,483
What's going on?

687
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,521
It's Jenna. Is he there?

688
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,525
And then,

689
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:48,503
the mattress transforms
into this giant bundt cake.

690
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,464
I'm really sorry to interrupt,

691
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,305
but your daughter's on the phone
and she does say it's urgent.

692
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,503
Okay.

693
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,415
Excuse me for one minute.

694
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,450
She told me she's moving out.
What the hell is going on, Dad?

695
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,077
Sweetheart, your mother's going
through a very tough time.

696
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,520
<i>- Don't make excuses for her.
- I'm not.</i>

697
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,558
You know, I'm just gonna
come over there. This is silly.

698
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,320
Jenna, I'm fine.

699
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,985
It's something
between your mother and me.

700
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,428
We'll work it out. We always do.

701
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,265
Right now,
I want you to look after yourself, okay?

702
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:21,764
Okay.

703
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,207
You sure you don't want
a little company?

704
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,270
Trust me, my current patient
is company enough.

705
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,472
Okay.

706
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,676
<i>Okay, sweetheart.
I have to go back to work now.</i>

707
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,350
<i>- Daddy?
- Yeah?</i>

708
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,554
It's a girl.

709
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,126
<i>We're having a baby girl.</i>

710
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,197
<i>Say something.</i>

711
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,126
I'm...

712
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,494
I'm so happy.

713
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,643
I got to go now, sweetheart.

714
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,839
<i>Okay?</i>

715
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,875
Okay.

716
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,250
I'll see you later. I love you.

717
00:43:09,285 --> 00:43:10,382
I'll see you later. I love you.

718
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,185
I love you.

719
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,413
Hold that thought.

720
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:43,645
Your timing's perfect.

721
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,917
My folks just dropped by.
I want you to meet them.

722
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,016
What?

723
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,660
- Joey.
- What up, Ken?

724
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,491
I'm going with you.

725
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,156
You're full of shit.

726
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,831
- I'm serious, man. When do we leave?
- Dude, don't fuck with me.

727
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:00,961
I'm not. You're right.

728
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,437
If we don't leave Wisconsin now,
we never will.

729
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,407
Besides, without me,
you'll never get laid.

730
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,740
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

731
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,374
- You're serious.
- I'm serious.

732
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,442
- You got any cash?
- $5,000.

733
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,109
- You?
- $700.

734
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,814
- And a fuckload of cheese.
- To cheese.

735
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:33,060
<i>- Hello.
- Are you going to be much longer?</i>

736
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:35,861
Probably not, no.

737
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,097
<i>Could you just
come home now, please?</i>

738
00:44:38,306 --> 00:44:41,241
I just need a few minutes.
Matthew has been fussy all day.

739
00:44:41,342 --> 00:44:42,741
I think it's his stomach.

740
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:45,170
<i>And I need some goat's milk.</i>

741
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:48,747
Okay, I'll be home soon.

742
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,010
<i>Thanks.</i>

743
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:52,343
Okay.

744
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:42,328
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

745
00:45:43,304 --> 00:45:47,604
I'm sorry. I can't stand us being like this
at each other all the time.

746
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,237
We have to try harder, okay?

747
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:54,374
I'm gonna try a lot harder.

748
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:01,082
I can't.

749
00:46:01,622 --> 00:46:02,714
What?

750
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:07,760
It's no good, Lise. This isn't working.

751
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:11,462
What are you talking about?

752
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,224
Look, we have to admit it.

753
00:46:14,335 --> 00:46:17,736
This is destroying us
and it's gonna destroy Matty.

754
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,037
Who is it?

755
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:23,539
- Who?
- What's her name?

756
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:25,305
What? No, that's not
what I'm talking about.

757
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:28,177
What exactly are you talking about,
Chris?

758
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:31,146
I'm talking about trying...

759
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:34,710
I'm talking about trying to do this apart,
for a little while at least.

760
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:37,120
To do what? To raise a child?

761
00:46:37,224 --> 00:46:38,521
To build a family? What, Chris?

762
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:41,720
No, I'm trying to understand
what the fuck you're saying here.

763
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:44,559
Or haven't you even really thought
about that?

764
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:45,723
Shit.

765
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:48,691
Of course I've thought about it.

766
00:46:48,803 --> 00:46:49,827
It's all I think about!

767
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:50,904
- Really?
- Yeah.

768
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,802
Or have you just thought about yourself?

769
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:54,602
Do you think that this is good for him?

770
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:55,835
That kid is gonna hate us

771
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:59,435
if he has to grow up listening
to us fight all day long.

772
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:02,610
So that's it, then.

773
00:47:04,085 --> 00:47:05,575
What about me?

774
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,747
- Am I just so easy to walk away from?
- Lisa, I love you.

775
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:14,624
Don't you fucking say that to me!
You have no idea what love is, Chris!

776
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:16,287
Lisa. Listen.

777
00:47:16,764 --> 00:47:19,232
We have a problem
and we have to face it.

778
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,791
Oh, you're right, Chris.
You are absolutely right.

779
00:47:24,805 --> 00:47:27,399
Get the fuck out, you fucking asshole!

780
00:47:30,344 --> 00:47:32,938
You know what? If you want to go, go.

781
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:36,177
I release you. Go be free.

782
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:40,283
But don't you ever expect to see me
or your child ever again, ever!

783
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:42,481
Lisa, stop it. Jesus, stop it.

784
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:46,852
Just go. Please. Go.

785
00:48:07,882 --> 00:48:09,907
- You're staying at a motel?
- No, it's a hotel.

786
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:12,008
And it's really very nice.
They've got a gym...

787
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,679
Come on, Mom. Please.
This is ridiculous.

788
00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:18,250
It's what I chose to do.
I'm going to find a place soon.

789
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:21,893
- And you really think you can start over?
- You mean at my age?

790
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:24,863
- Yes, yes I do.
- I'm still breathing, aren't I?

791
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:26,432
I'm still here.

792
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:28,661
It's a long time ago.
Daddy'll understand.

793
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:31,670
No, that's... That's not the point of this.

794
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,307
You've been together since college.

795
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:36,100
Yup.

796
00:48:36,877 --> 00:48:39,812
And do you know how miserable
I've been almost the whole time?

797
00:48:39,914 --> 00:48:42,246
- I don't think that's true.
- Well, I've just kept it from you.

798
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:43,373
Yeah, trust me, Mom,

799
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:45,679
you're not that good
at hiding your emotions.

800
00:48:45,786 --> 00:48:46,980
Really?

801
00:48:47,621 --> 00:48:50,681
I'm sorry. You make this difficult
because you want it that way.

802
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,224
Men are easy.

803
00:48:53,894 --> 00:48:55,862
And you've been with Michael, what,

804
00:48:55,963 --> 00:48:58,022
- three years, right?
- Yeah.

805
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:00,797
And it took me less than half an hour
to figure him out.

806
00:49:00,901 --> 00:49:03,665
- Wow. Oh, you're lucky. Jeez.
- Mom.

807
00:49:04,138 --> 00:49:06,106
You know exactly what Daddy wants.

808
00:49:06,207 --> 00:49:09,506
And you know how to make him happy
and how to make him miserable.

809
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,237
Every woman does.

810
00:49:11,846 --> 00:49:14,679
If you're bored, Mom, you know,
that's your fault, not his.

811
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:15,942
Bored.

812
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:19,915
You've always been
your father's daughter,

813
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,011
and if you want to side with him
this time, that's fine.

814
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:24,455
- This is not about sides, Mom.
- Don't!

815
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:31,656
Don't pretend that you know
what goes into a 30-year marriage,

816
00:49:31,765 --> 00:49:33,960
because you don't have a clue.

817
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:36,266
You don't have a clue.

818
00:49:41,275 --> 00:49:44,369
Are you all right? I'm sorry.
I don't want to upset you.

819
00:49:44,478 --> 00:49:47,106
Can we have some
chamomile tea, please?

820
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:52,008
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, it's Michael.</i>

821
00:49:52,486 --> 00:49:55,080
<i>Hey, Michael!
I've been thinking about you.</i>

822
00:49:55,189 --> 00:49:57,487
Really? What kind of thoughts?

823
00:49:57,591 --> 00:50:00,321
You know exactly what kind of thoughts.

824
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:04,987
<i>- What are you doing?
- I'm at work.</i>

825
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:08,233
Yeah, I'm trying to picture it.
Where's your office?

826
00:50:08,402 --> 00:50:09,664
<i>It's Zander-Cohen.</i>

827
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:12,261
It's a pretty big architecture firm.

828
00:50:12,773 --> 00:50:15,037
<i>Impressive. Do you have a view?</i>

829
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:18,475
Yeah. It's a nice view.

830
00:50:18,579 --> 00:50:21,241
<i>Yeah? Can you see what I'm doing?</i>

831
00:50:21,348 --> 00:50:23,043
It's not that nice.

832
00:50:26,754 --> 00:50:30,087
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry.

833
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:33,790
<i>So are we still on for tonight?</i>

834
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:36,622
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

835
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:40,029
So, like, 8:00, right?
You want me to pick you up?

836
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:42,529
Yeah, 8:00. I'll be waiting.

837
00:50:42,636 --> 00:50:44,331
All right, cool. Bye.

838
00:50:46,774 --> 00:50:48,241
Who was that?

839
00:50:50,544 --> 00:50:52,136
Just this friend.

840
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,110
Do you have a friend I don't know?

841
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:58,276
This guy from school.
Going through a divorce.

842
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:06,287
By the way,
I was going to ask you a favor.

843
00:51:06,393 --> 00:51:06,921
What?

844
00:51:06,956 --> 00:51:07,450
What?

845
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:11,890
I was gonna go out with him tonight
and Jenna fucking hates him,

846
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,093
so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you,
if that's cool.

847
00:51:16,737 --> 00:51:18,898
You're fucking around on her.

848
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:21,199
What?

849
00:51:21,775 --> 00:51:23,640
It's a guy from school.

850
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:27,438
No. Don't get me involved in this,
please.

851
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:30,016
How can you fuck around on Jenna?
She's perfect.

852
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:32,517
She's beautiful. She's like a guy.

853
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,713
What more could you ask for?

854
00:51:35,823 --> 00:51:38,815
- I'm telling her I'm with you.
- No. Michael, what are you doing?

855
00:51:38,926 --> 00:51:41,690
Don't tell her you're out with me.
No, I'm gonna screw it up. I can't lie.

856
00:51:41,795 --> 00:51:44,161
You're both gonna hate me forever.
Leave me out of it.

857
00:51:44,265 --> 00:51:46,927
- I have faith in you.
- No. Come here. Michael. Come here.

858
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,296
Michael, Michael.

859
00:51:48,402 --> 00:51:50,632
Hey, Michael, come here a second.

860
00:51:51,205 --> 00:51:52,934
My boss said to tell you
that there's this guy

861
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,907
who really wants to buy this thing
coming by tomorrow.

862
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,534
But he is full of shit.

863
00:51:57,645 --> 00:51:59,272
I mean, I've worked here for three years.

864
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,871
You're the first people
I ever showed it to.

865
00:52:03,117 --> 00:52:06,314
Smoked a lot of weed in there, though.
It's good for that.

866
00:52:07,488 --> 00:52:09,820
<i>- Hello.
- Izzy, your father, he isn't breathing.</i>

867
00:52:09,957 --> 00:52:11,117
<i>You need to get home quickly.</i>

868
00:52:11,225 --> 00:52:12,192
Okay.

869
00:52:12,493 --> 00:52:14,927
<i>I called the ambulance
and the fire volunteers.</i>

870
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:16,155
I gotta go.

871
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:22,268
Chris is moving into Kenny's?

872
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:25,429
I think so, so they can, like,
figure some stuff out.

873
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:27,029
I don't get it. He has a child.

874
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:28,836
I know, but, come on,
you've seen them together.

875
00:52:28,942 --> 00:52:29,931
She's sort of lost her mind.

876
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:32,979
- This is her fault?
- It's nobody's fault. It's just...

877
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:35,740
I don't know. I think he just needs
to talk to somebody.

878
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:37,373
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late.

879
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:40,510
- I'll be at my dad's till around 11:00.
- Okay.

880
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:43,852
God, what's happening?
Everyone around us is falling apart.

881
00:52:44,224 --> 00:52:45,350
I know.

882
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:53,194
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

883
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:08,743
- Hi!
- I got this!

884
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:10,380
I don't need it!

885
00:53:14,588 --> 00:53:16,055
- Oh, my God!
- My God!

886
00:53:16,156 --> 00:53:18,215
Oh, my God. My top is totally clinging.

887
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:19,349
You can see everything.

888
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,257
Don't worry, I promise I won't look.

889
00:53:21,362 --> 00:53:22,920
Then I'll be insulted.

890
00:53:25,632 --> 00:53:28,294
- Well, I don't want to offend you.
- Well, then.

891
00:53:33,941 --> 00:53:35,306
Your top's wet.

892
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,269
Okay. Where am I going?

893
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:41,041
Straight ahead. Turn left.

894
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,814
Your kind of party, huh?

895
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,753
I was never in a fraternity.
I was much too serious.

896
00:53:49,857 --> 00:53:52,826
I bet you were 29
even when you were 19.

897
00:53:52,926 --> 00:53:54,621
Put it this way. If I had to do it again,

898
00:53:54,728 --> 00:53:56,525
I'd do it knowing that after you graduate,

899
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:59,098
no one ever gives a fuck
what your GPA was.

900
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:01,732
Hey! Kim!

901
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:03,666
Hi!

902
00:54:03,771 --> 00:54:05,796
This is Sara,
and Bridgitte and John.

903
00:54:05,906 --> 00:54:07,999
- Hey. How's it going?
- Cool.

904
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:09,539
Sorry about that.

905
00:54:11,645 --> 00:54:14,205
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

906
00:54:15,149 --> 00:54:18,607
Chris, it's Jenna. Michael and you
both have your cell phones off.

907
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,154
Listen, Izzy's dad just died.

908
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:26,192
We're all gonna head over there,
so I guess I'll see you guys there. Bye.

909
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:30,923
Go ahead. I'll be okay.

910
00:54:31,432 --> 00:54:34,868
- I want things to be okay, Daddy.
- I know.

911
00:54:35,235 --> 00:54:37,226
Go ahead. Take care of your friend.

912
00:54:37,337 --> 00:54:39,134
I'm fine. I really am.

913
00:55:27,788 --> 00:55:30,256
<i>You have no messages. Main menu.</i>

914
00:56:11,198 --> 00:56:13,223
- Hey.
- Hello, Jenna.

915
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,097
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, darling.

916
00:56:16,203 --> 00:56:17,261
Thank you.

917
00:56:17,804 --> 00:56:21,069
Thank you for coming. Go.
Everybody is in the back room.

918
00:56:21,174 --> 00:56:22,801
- Okay.
- Thank you.

919
00:56:25,178 --> 00:56:26,770
Hey. Thanks for coming.

920
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:32,845
- I don't know what to say. Are you okay?
- No. I don't know.

921
00:56:33,487 --> 00:56:35,717
The last thing I did was quit on him.

922
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,848
He knew you loved him.

923
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,157
- Hey.
- Hey.

924
00:56:41,862 --> 00:56:43,295
Hey, where's Michael?

925
00:56:43,397 --> 00:56:45,490
He went out with Chris.
I haven't been able to reach them.

926
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,396
No, Chris is in the kitchen.

927
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:50,736
- Good. I'll be back.
- Okay.

928
00:57:01,381 --> 00:57:02,405
Hey.

929
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:06,917
- Michael's not here.
- Why not?

930
00:57:08,455 --> 00:57:10,753
I don't know. Did you try him at home?

931
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:23,900
<i>Hi, you've reached Michael and Jenna...</i>

932
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:34,840
Hey, he's not there
and his cell's still turned off.

933
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:37,781
You told him you were coming here.
He knows, right?

934
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:40,113
I told him. Or, I mean...

935
00:57:41,722 --> 00:57:43,451
What? Did you?

936
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:47,157
Oh, man. I'm not gonna do this.

937
00:57:48,962 --> 00:57:51,624
- I can't do this.
- Do what?

938
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:54,567
- What's wrong?
- Can't do what?

939
00:57:54,835 --> 00:57:56,962
- Chris? Chris, can't do what?
- Jenna, please.

940
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,664
- Can't do what, Chris?
- You should just talk to Michael.

941
00:57:59,773 --> 00:58:01,638
Talk to him about what, Chris?

942
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:04,771
What the hell are you talking about?

943
00:58:04,878 --> 00:58:07,039
Listen, don't ask me
any more questions, please.

944
00:58:07,147 --> 00:58:08,136
He should be telling you.

945
00:58:08,248 --> 00:58:09,081
- Tell me what?
- I don't know!

946
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:09,915
- Tell me what?
- I don't know!

947
00:58:10,017 --> 00:58:11,780
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

948
00:58:12,252 --> 00:58:15,187
- Who is he with right now?
- I don't know!

949
00:58:15,288 --> 00:58:16,550
Is he seeing somebody?

950
00:58:16,657 --> 00:58:18,420
- Why are you asking me?
- Just tell me the truth.

951
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:20,755
Is he seeing somebody else, Chris?
Look at me!

952
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:23,091
I'm looking at you.
I don't know if he's seeing anybody else.

953
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:24,720
You don't know.
How could you not know?

954
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:26,389
I don't know anything.

955
00:58:30,404 --> 00:58:31,393
<i>Hey. This is Michael.</i>

956
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:33,097
<i>- Leave a message...
- What is with the yelling?</i>

957
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:35,470
- Where did he go?
- I don't know. Jenna!

958
00:58:41,682 --> 00:58:43,912
Michael, call me as soon as you get
this message. I'm gonna kill you.

959
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:45,746
Oh, my God! What the hell
are you doing? You're calling him?

960
00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:47,615
- No, that wasn't him.
- To tell him what? What is this?

961
00:58:47,721 --> 00:58:49,655
- What the fuck is this?
- I honestly have no fucking idea.

962
00:58:49,756 --> 00:58:51,485
- Yes, you do. Do you know her?
- Just give me a break.

963
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:52,649
- No, I don't.
- Do you know her?

964
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:55,159
- No! They just met. Be quiet.
- What?

965
00:58:55,262 --> 00:58:58,060
Jenna, they're just...
Listen to me. Whoa!

966
00:58:58,165 --> 00:58:59,257
God, I'm gonna kill him!

967
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:01,994
Come here. Jenna! Come here!
Come here! Come here! Jenna!

968
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:03,626
They're just friends!

969
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,598
Fuck!

970
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:21,112
You make me feel 10 years younger.

971
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:24,949
Ten years?
Then I'm seducing a younger man.

972
00:59:25,058 --> 00:59:26,184
Excellent.

973
00:59:27,327 --> 00:59:30,125
You're trying to make me lose my mind,
aren't you?

974
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:32,323
I've already lost mine.

975
01:00:00,794 --> 01:00:01,886
Come on.

976
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:04,987
Let's go back to my room.
My roommate's gone.

977
01:00:05,766 --> 01:00:09,258
I can spend the whole night
making love to you.

978
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:12,771
Oh, my God.

979
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:22,315
I can't. I can't. I gotta go. I gotta go.

980
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:24,212
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

981
01:00:24,317 --> 01:00:26,148
I gotta go. This isn't right.

982
01:00:26,253 --> 01:00:28,949
- Yeah, it is.
- No, no, no. Kim, it isn't.

983
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,580
And I don't know what I thought
was gonna happen tonight.

984
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:34,592
I definitely know what I hoped
was gonna happen tonight.

985
01:00:35,295 --> 01:00:36,922
But this isn't cool.

986
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,124
I really, really, really want
to have sex with you.

987
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,000
Yeah. I can tell.

988
01:00:45,672 --> 01:00:47,833
- You can tell that?
- Yeah.

989
01:00:48,308 --> 01:00:49,798
Subtle signs.

990
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:53,840
But I can't. I can't.

991
01:01:01,121 --> 01:01:02,349
I'm sorry.

992
01:01:11,398 --> 01:01:12,422
Michael?

993
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:17,394
Okay.

994
01:01:18,572 --> 01:01:20,005
It's gonna be okay.

995
01:01:24,344 --> 01:01:26,005
He's gonna come home.

996
01:01:26,446 --> 01:01:28,107
He's gonna come home.

997
01:01:29,749 --> 01:01:31,410
He's gonna come home.

998
01:01:39,226 --> 01:01:40,818
<i>Hey, this is Michael...</i>

999
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:57,576
Do something for me.

1000
01:01:58,178 --> 01:01:59,236
What?

1001
01:02:00,347 --> 01:02:03,612
Go home, tell her that it's over
and leave her.

1002
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:06,550
- I can't.
- What? You're an amazing guy.

1003
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:08,621
You wouldn't be here with me right now

1004
01:02:08,722 --> 01:02:11,555
unless you knew something
was missing in your life.

1005
01:02:11,992 --> 01:02:13,892
You can't force things. I mean,

1006
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,291
relationships, they either work,
or they don't.

1007
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:23,161
I could be your last chance
at happiness.

1008
01:02:42,088 --> 01:02:43,350
Come inside.

1009
01:02:48,929 --> 01:02:50,055
I can't.

1010
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,598
Okay. Good night.

1011
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:25,591
- Jenna?
- Where are you?

1012
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,232
<i>Where are you?</i>

1013
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:37,733
No! No! No!

1014
01:03:38,378 --> 01:03:39,902
Oh, fuck!

1015
01:03:40,447 --> 01:03:42,574
- Jenna, I had an accident.
- You asshole!

1016
01:03:42,682 --> 01:03:43,671
I had a car accident!

1017
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:46,149
Who the fuck are you with, you bastard?

1018
01:03:46,686 --> 01:03:47,812
Jenna!

1019
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:51,656
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1020
01:03:51,758 --> 01:03:52,884
I knew this was gonna happen!

1021
01:03:52,993 --> 01:03:55,325
I knew this was gonna fucking happen.

1022
01:04:14,514 --> 01:04:16,914
I'm here. I'm here.

1023
01:04:18,485 --> 01:04:20,544
Why would you lie to me, Michael?

1024
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:22,614
What are you talking about?

1025
01:04:22,722 --> 01:04:24,656
What were you doing all night?

1026
01:04:25,525 --> 01:04:26,856
I was with Chris.

1027
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:31,487
God, you lying bastard.
You make me so sick.

1028
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:33,394
I was with Chris, I swear.

1029
01:04:37,237 --> 01:04:39,671
It's him. You want to ask him?
You can ask him. Chris?

1030
01:04:39,773 --> 01:04:42,207
<i>Jenna knows everything.
I didn't tell her.</i>

1031
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:44,970
<i>Michael? Hello?</i>

1032
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,411
You don't want me to talk to him?

1033
01:04:49,516 --> 01:04:51,780
Why, is that because
you're a lying piece of shit?

1034
01:04:51,885 --> 01:04:53,443
I didn't do anything wrong, Jenna.

1035
01:04:53,553 --> 01:04:54,645
Who is she?

1036
01:04:54,954 --> 01:04:58,048
- What are you talking about?
- I want to know who she is.

1037
01:04:58,191 --> 01:04:59,658
You're blowing this
way out of proportion, baby.

1038
01:04:59,759 --> 01:05:01,750
Who were you with, Michael?

1039
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:05,744
This girl I met. It was nothing.
It was nothing.

1040
01:05:05,779 --> 01:05:07,092
This girl I met. It was nothing.
It was nothing.

1041
01:05:12,105 --> 01:05:13,936
Did you have sex with her?

1042
01:05:14,507 --> 01:05:16,998
Tell me. Did you cheat on me, asshole?

1043
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:19,639
I kissed her.

1044
01:05:22,515 --> 01:05:25,075
It was one kiss
and it meant absolutely nothing, baby!

1045
01:05:25,185 --> 01:05:26,618
I did such a stupid thing!

1046
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,519
- It was a stupid thing. I'm so sorry.
- You make me sick, you fucking slut.

1047
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,681
Slut?

1048
01:05:37,163 --> 01:05:40,360
"Kim"? You have her number
programmed into your cell phone?

1049
01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:42,560
- Who is this dirty whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!

1050
01:05:42,669 --> 01:05:44,569
- Who is this fucking whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!

1051
01:05:44,671 --> 01:05:46,036
- No. But you wanted to, right?
- No!

1052
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:47,936
- Bullshit. Is she prettier than me?
- No!

1053
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,030
- Liar!
- No, Jen!

1054
01:05:49,142 --> 01:05:50,666
What am I supposed to do now, huh?

1055
01:05:50,777 --> 01:05:52,506
What the fuck
am I supposed to do now?

1056
01:05:52,612 --> 01:05:53,874
You've ruined everything!

1057
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,845
Will you listen to me?
Nothing happened!

1058
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:58,611
Nothing? You kissed her.

1059
01:05:58,718 --> 01:06:01,448
You were out with another woman
all night. I'm pregnant.

1060
01:06:01,554 --> 01:06:04,250
- Is that fucking nothing to you?
- Yes! No!

1061
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:07,554
How many times did you kiss her?
Don't you dare lie to me.

1062
01:06:09,162 --> 01:06:10,390
Several times.

1063
01:06:11,731 --> 01:06:14,256
Oh, God, you make me sick!

1064
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:16,597
But it didn't mean anything, baby.
She made me realize

1065
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,069
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you. I know that now.

1066
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:23,233
I'm three months pregnant and you're
already out trying to fuck other women!

1067
01:06:23,676 --> 01:06:25,507
What's gonna happen
10 years from now?

1068
01:06:25,612 --> 01:06:28,137
How could I ever trust
anything you say again?

1069
01:06:28,248 --> 01:06:29,374
Jenna.

1070
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:31,611
Fuck you, man. It's over.

1071
01:06:31,784 --> 01:06:32,978
- Jenna.
- Get out right now.

1072
01:06:33,086 --> 01:06:35,077
I'll tell you when you can come back
and get your shit.

1073
01:06:35,188 --> 01:06:36,587
Maybe Kimmy can help you pack.

1074
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:38,657
- Jenna, we're having a baby.
- No.

1075
01:06:38,825 --> 01:06:43,159
No, I am the one having this baby.
I'm the pregnant one, not you.

1076
01:06:43,263 --> 01:06:47,700
And she's better off with no father
than a lying asshole like you!

1077
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,631
You're overreacting.
It was a couple kisses.

1078
01:06:49,736 --> 01:06:51,328
After three years, Jenna, things happen.

1079
01:06:51,437 --> 01:06:54,235
- Not to me, they don't! Get out!
- And go where?

1080
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,740
Get out of here! Go back to fucking Kim!

1081
01:06:56,843 --> 01:06:58,606
What, are you gonna fucking stab me,
Jenna?

1082
01:06:58,711 --> 01:07:00,269
- Get out!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

1083
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,211
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

1084
01:07:02,315 --> 01:07:05,478
- Get the fuck out!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

1085
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:31,570
- Hello.
- Hey. Don't hang up.

1086
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:34,571
<i>Look, I'm so sorry about before.
I think...</i>

1087
01:07:34,881 --> 01:07:37,213
God, I must've had too much to drink
or something,

1088
01:07:37,317 --> 01:07:41,083
but if I promise not to try to kiss you
or anything,

1089
01:07:41,187 --> 01:07:43,519
will you come over here and talk to me?

1090
01:07:44,123 --> 01:07:46,284
I really need to talk to you.

1091
01:09:01,968 --> 01:09:03,060
Anna?

1092
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:11,602
Anna?

1093
01:09:34,734 --> 01:09:37,100
- Hi.
- Hey.

1094
01:09:38,638 --> 01:09:40,401
I promise I won't touch you.

1095
01:10:59,485 --> 01:11:00,452
Hey.

1096
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:04,415
I don't care about tomorrow
or anything else.

1097
01:11:05,525 --> 01:11:07,390
I just care that you're here.

1098
01:11:52,104 --> 01:11:53,196
Fuck!

1099
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,770
Oh, fuck!

1100
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:17,086
Why'd you leave
without saying goodbye?

1101
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:20,563
I have to go to this work thing.
I didn't want to wake you up.

1102
01:12:21,534 --> 01:12:23,092
Have you seen my keys?

1103
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:31,543
You can't wait to get back to her,
can you?

1104
01:12:32,211 --> 01:12:34,577
Can you just please
help me find my keys?

1105
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,008
What did I do?

1106
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:42,346
You didn't do anything, Kim.
You're amazing.

1107
01:12:42,555 --> 01:12:45,115
You were amazing.
Last night was perfect.

1108
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:54,557
Here.

1109
01:12:58,471 --> 01:12:59,563
Thank you.

1110
01:13:01,374 --> 01:13:02,932
Are you gonna call me?

1111
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,338
I'll call you.

1112
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:15,106
Unlock the door, Jenna.

1113
01:14:15,381 --> 01:14:17,849
I'm packing. Come back later.
The house will be empty.

1114
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:21,545
No. You have to come talk to me.
Things are not going to end like this.

1115
01:14:21,654 --> 01:14:25,454
- Like I did this. Move your foot.
- I panicked. I made a huge mistake.

1116
01:14:26,959 --> 01:14:27,926
Fuck!

1117
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:30,560
Jenna, open the door!

1118
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:32,463
Michael?

1119
01:14:32,565 --> 01:14:35,500
- Is anything wrong?
- Everything's fine. I locked myself out.

1120
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:39,867
- Jenna, you're having our baby!
- Yeah, well, maybe I won't keep it!

1121
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:41,705
Don't you ever say that, Jenna.

1122
01:14:41,807 --> 01:14:44,002
Don't ever say anything like that
ever again!

1123
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:46,670
I can do whatever the hell I want.
We're not married, remember?

1124
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:49,976
- We're both free, just like you wanted.
- I made a mistake.

1125
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:53,074
You're right. Too late, man.
Move your goddamn foot.

1126
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:57,678
Hi.

1127
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:14,564
Hi, darling.

1128
01:15:18,544 --> 01:15:19,772
What's going on?

1129
01:15:22,982 --> 01:15:24,347
Jenna?

1130
01:15:25,217 --> 01:15:26,479
Sweetheart.

1131
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:32,650
Oh, honey.

1132
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:39,957
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

1133
01:15:44,937 --> 01:15:47,929
All right, come on.
Come on, just come in.

1134
01:15:49,775 --> 01:15:51,868
Oh, sweetie. You'll be fine, sweetheart.

1135
01:16:20,806 --> 01:16:22,865
- Jenna?
- Hey, it's me.

1136
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,631
<i>- Hello.
- Is she there?</i>

1137
01:17:59,538 --> 01:18:00,596
Anna?

1138
01:18:01,874 --> 01:18:04,206
<i>I'm coming over. Please don't tell her.</i>

1139
01:18:21,727 --> 01:18:23,957
I know I'm being such a pain in the ass
right now,

1140
01:18:24,063 --> 01:18:25,724
but I had to come and see you.

1141
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:27,355
- Hi.
- Hi.

1142
01:18:27,466 --> 01:18:30,196
I know you're like, "This girl's a freak,
get her away from me,"

1143
01:18:30,302 --> 01:18:33,760
but I have something for you.

1144
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:44,107
Don't you want to know what it is?

1145
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:48,847
I made you, like, the best mix CD ever.
I mean, there's a ton of stuff on it.

1146
01:18:48,954 --> 01:18:50,012
Like some really cool Madison bands

1147
01:18:50,122 --> 01:18:51,419
that I'm sure you've never heard
of before.

1148
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,582
And, like, the first song
that we danced to.

1149
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:55,956
And there's also, like,
this song of me playing the flute

1150
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:59,360
which you're gonna think
is totally God-awful. But I thought it'd...

1151
01:18:59,465 --> 01:19:00,727
- Kim.
- What?

1152
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,667
There's something I have to tell you.

1153
01:19:02,702 --> 01:19:03,735
There's something I have to tell you.

1154
01:19:07,139 --> 01:19:10,973
I'm having a baby with a woman
that I'm very much in love with.

1155
01:19:15,314 --> 01:19:18,579
You told me that you were confused,
that you wanted to leave her.

1156
01:19:18,684 --> 01:19:21,710
I know. I was confused, Kim.
I was so confused.

1157
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:24,983
And it was wrong of me
to get you tangled up in that.

1158
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,718
How could you not tell me
that you were having a baby?

1159
01:19:27,826 --> 01:19:30,590
Because I'm an asshole.
I did a bad thing.

1160
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:32,819
I have no excuse.

1161
01:19:32,932 --> 01:19:35,127
There nothing I can say to you

1162
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:39,762
other than that I'm so sorry,
and it's really not about you at all.

1163
01:19:39,872 --> 01:19:41,772
Why do people always say that?

1164
01:19:42,641 --> 01:19:46,008
How can it not be about me
if you can sleep with me one minute,

1165
01:19:46,111 --> 01:19:48,272
and then walk out on me the next?

1166
01:19:49,014 --> 01:19:50,481
I'm sorry, Kim.

1167
01:19:52,084 --> 01:19:53,483
I gotta go.

1168
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,330
- All right.
- All right.

1169
01:20:12,438 --> 01:20:13,996
No, you'll be fine.

1170
01:20:14,506 --> 01:20:16,303
You are the suckiest driver.

1171
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:19,639
No way. I'm not.

1172
01:20:20,312 --> 01:20:23,213
Well, how many miles do you think
you guys will be making fun of me for?

1173
01:20:23,315 --> 01:20:24,805
I'd say pretty much
the whole entire way.

1174
01:20:24,917 --> 01:20:26,578
I'm not going to make fun of you.

1175
01:20:26,685 --> 01:20:28,448
I think there's a bus stop...

1176
01:20:28,721 --> 01:20:31,121
- Is there a bus down there? Oh, good.
- It's four miles.

1177
01:20:31,223 --> 01:20:33,088
Because my friends aren't giving me
a ride home, so...

1178
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:34,955
I think it's going to rain.

1179
01:20:36,328 --> 01:20:37,852
Sorry I'm not coming, guys.

1180
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:41,421
- No, don't apologize.
- No. You're doing the right thing, man.

1181
01:20:45,471 --> 01:20:47,336
- Send a postcard?
- Sure.

1182
01:20:47,673 --> 01:20:48,731
Call me.

1183
01:20:50,342 --> 01:20:51,502
Fly's down.

1184
01:21:25,377 --> 01:21:26,435
Honey.

1185
01:21:28,747 --> 01:21:30,374
Michael's coming over.

1186
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:34,310
- You told him I was here?
- He knew.

1187
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,047
Come on, Mom.

1188
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,161
Jenna, sweetheart, look, I know.
I know it hurts like hell

1189
01:21:44,263 --> 01:21:46,163
and I am sorry, I really am.

1190
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:49,132
But you know, two days ago
you told me these things happen...

1191
01:21:49,234 --> 01:21:51,259
You and Daddy have been together
30 years, Mom.

1192
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,565
We aren't even married yet
and he's already cheating on me.

1193
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:54,764
I know. I know.

1194
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:57,171
And I really don't need you
to defend him right now, okay?

1195
01:21:57,276 --> 01:22:01,269
I'm not. There's nothing to defend.
It's despicable. He did an awful thing.

1196
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,349
It's not an awful thing, Mom.
It's an unforgivable thing.

1197
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,747
Unforgivable?

1198
01:22:10,155 --> 01:22:11,588
What do you want?

1199
01:22:11,723 --> 01:22:15,523
- I just want to talk to you!
- Get out of here! It's over!

1200
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:18,859
- Jenna?
- You hear me? It's over!

1201
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:28,639
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Let him in.

1202
01:22:33,178 --> 01:22:34,236
Thank you.

1203
01:22:35,047 --> 01:22:37,208
No, wait. Let me talk to her again.

1204
01:22:41,553 --> 01:22:43,350
Jenna. Open up.

1205
01:22:44,123 --> 01:22:47,024
Michael's not here.
He's outside with your dad.

1206
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:48,885
Jenna.

1207
01:22:59,805 --> 01:23:02,273
Have you got something to say
for yourself?

1208
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:10,407
I don't know, I'm... I panicked.
I got scared.

1209
01:23:12,217 --> 01:23:13,616
Well, that's a very compelling argument.

1210
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:16,119
You won't have any trouble
convincing her of that.

1211
01:23:17,756 --> 01:23:19,747
What the fuck were you thinking?

1212
01:23:20,392 --> 01:23:21,984
Did you just get bored?

1213
01:23:22,828 --> 01:23:26,161
- No, I'm just an idiot.
- On that much, we're agreed.

1214
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:29,834
I love her, Stephen.

1215
01:23:30,202 --> 01:23:32,864
I realize now I love her more
than I will ever love anybody else.

1216
01:23:32,971 --> 01:23:34,268
Stop talking about love.

1217
01:23:34,373 --> 01:23:36,603
Every asshole in the world
says he loves somebody.

1218
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:38,335
- It means nothing.
- But it's true.

1219
01:23:38,443 --> 01:23:40,411
It still doesn't mean anything.

1220
01:23:40,746 --> 01:23:43,180
What you feel only matters to you.

1221
01:23:43,415 --> 01:23:47,374
It's what you do to the people
you say you love, that's what matters.

1222
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:49,477
It's the only thing that counts.

1223
01:23:49,755 --> 01:23:51,848
And you did do this thing, right?

1224
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,927
I just saw the rest of my life,
and there were no more surprises.

1225
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:07,832
This was it.

1226
01:24:09,074 --> 01:24:10,666
I mean, it was great...

1227
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:13,539
But it was it.

1228
01:24:22,955 --> 01:24:25,150
What makes you think
this isn't gonna happen again?

1229
01:24:25,257 --> 01:24:27,225
- I know it won't.
- Oh, right.

1230
01:24:27,459 --> 01:24:28,517
Come on!

1231
01:24:28,627 --> 01:24:31,221
Aren't we supposed to be able
to learn from our mistakes?

1232
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:34,026
I did something horrible,
but I learned from it.

1233
01:24:34,299 --> 01:24:36,927
I met this little brunette and I faltered.

1234
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:42,897
Are you telling me that throughout your
entire marriage you never faltered?

1235
01:24:48,347 --> 01:24:49,473
You haven't?

1236
01:24:52,317 --> 01:24:53,443
Never?

1237
01:24:54,886 --> 01:24:56,820
- Never.
- Oh, that makes me feel great.

1238
01:24:56,922 --> 01:24:59,117
You think it's because I wasn't tempted?

1239
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,555
You think that this woman

1240
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:03,492
is the last brunette that's ever gonna
let you know that she wants you?

1241
01:25:03,595 --> 01:25:06,325
Look at me.
I haven't met my last brunette.

1242
01:25:07,599 --> 01:25:09,726
She's the last one I'm gonna kiss.

1243
01:25:13,772 --> 01:25:16,138
I'm in love with your daughter, Stephen.

1244
01:25:16,842 --> 01:25:19,470
And maybe that doesn't mean anything
to you, but I'm standing here.

1245
01:25:19,578 --> 01:25:22,172
You're her father. I'm looking you
in the eyes and I'm telling you,

1246
01:25:22,281 --> 01:25:24,909
I will do anything in the world
to get your daughter back.

1247
01:25:25,017 --> 01:25:27,508
- Really? Anything?
- I'll do anything.

1248
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:31,956
- People say that. They don't mean it.
- But I mean it.

1249
01:25:34,393 --> 01:25:35,985
Well, it's very simple.

1250
01:25:37,763 --> 01:25:39,458
Just do whatever it takes.

1251
01:25:44,036 --> 01:25:45,799
- It's that simple.
- Yes.

1252
01:25:46,204 --> 01:25:48,729
You can't fail if you don't give up.

1253
01:25:52,244 --> 01:25:55,111
You know, being right
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

1254
01:25:55,547 --> 01:25:59,210
And you can't try so hard to control it all.

1255
01:25:59,818 --> 01:26:03,117
You know, life is pretty much
in the grays for the most part.

1256
01:26:03,221 --> 01:26:05,746
And if you insist always
on black and white,

1257
01:26:05,857 --> 01:26:08,087
you are gonna be very unhappy.

1258
01:26:09,361 --> 01:26:11,261
That's a convenient philosophy for you,
Mom.

1259
01:26:11,363 --> 01:26:15,026
Look, I don't defend what I did
to your father.

1260
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:18,003
But the truth of the matter
is that we both gave up.

1261
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:22,263
But now we are trying,
we are trying very hard

1262
01:26:23,442 --> 01:26:25,376
to get back on track

1263
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:28,935
by listening to each other,
something we've never done.

1264
01:26:29,815 --> 01:26:33,876
Honey, whatever you decide
about Michael, talk to him.

1265
01:26:34,753 --> 01:26:36,345
As painful as it is.

1266
01:26:37,089 --> 01:26:39,319
Don't be so quick to walk away.

1267
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:46,862
She's in her room.

1268
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,958
People know the truth.

1269
01:26:51,103 --> 01:26:54,937
They may not like it or want to know it,
but they always know.

1270
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:58,968
Lie, and you will lose her.

1271
01:27:59,671 --> 01:28:02,333
It'll never happen again in my life.
I promise.

1272
01:28:02,874 --> 01:28:05,775
Why did you do something so awful
to me?

1273
01:28:09,714 --> 01:28:11,181
Because I was scared.

1274
01:28:12,684 --> 01:28:14,584
Do you know what?
I don't want to hear it.

1275
01:28:14,686 --> 01:28:16,244
You said you're okay
with having this baby.

1276
01:28:16,354 --> 01:28:17,821
What am I supposed to say to you,
Jenna?

1277
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:20,323
I'm terrified that my life is over?

1278
01:28:20,692 --> 01:28:23,559
I'm terrified because I don't think
I'm ready to grow up yet?

1279
01:28:23,662 --> 01:28:26,130
I mean, a guy can't say that
to the woman that's having his baby.

1280
01:28:26,231 --> 01:28:28,791
- You would've never forgiven me.
- No, you're right, and I don't.

1281
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,299
That doesn't mean I feel that way now,
though.

1282
01:28:30,402 --> 01:28:32,029
No, now you feel guilty.
You're still scared.

1283
01:28:32,137 --> 01:28:34,605
You're just scared of what I'll do to you.

1284
01:28:35,707 --> 01:28:37,197
Well, that's true.

1285
01:28:40,412 --> 01:28:44,143
- You were really terrified?
- Jenna, I am terrified.

1286
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,076
So am I, you idiot.

1287
01:28:47,052 --> 01:28:49,850
I'm scared I'm gonna be a bad mother,

1288
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:54,255
and you won't love me,
and you'll ignore me, and...

1289
01:28:54,392 --> 01:28:56,952
I won't want you,
and the whole thing will fall apart

1290
01:28:57,062 --> 01:28:58,859
and I won't know what to do.

1291
01:29:00,098 --> 01:29:01,759
- Baby, that's not gonna happen.
- How do you know?

1292
01:29:01,867 --> 01:29:03,129
Because I know.

1293
01:29:04,402 --> 01:29:06,893
- You know now, you didn't know before?
- Yes.

1294
01:29:07,405 --> 01:29:08,565
I know now.

1295
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:16,079
Were you telling me the truth last night?

1296
01:29:16,348 --> 01:29:18,043
You didn't sleep with her?

1297
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,516
I was telling you the truth.

1298
01:29:41,139 --> 01:29:42,629
But then I went back.

1299
01:29:49,447 --> 01:29:50,505
Fuck you!

1300
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:53,409
Jenna. Calm down! Listen to me.
I'm telling you the truth.

1301
01:29:53,518 --> 01:29:55,679
- Get the fuck out!
- I'm telling you the truth!

1302
01:29:55,854 --> 01:29:59,187
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

1303
01:29:59,858 --> 01:30:02,622
I'm sorry!
I'm trying to be totally honest with you!

1304
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:06,322
Jenna, I could've lied and I'd be inside
that door right now, but I didn't.

1305
01:30:06,431 --> 01:30:08,558
Isn't the truth more important
than anything else, Jenna?

1306
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:11,431
Not if the truth
is you slept with another woman!

1307
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:12,628
Jen?

1308
01:30:12,737 --> 01:30:15,365
Just listen to me for one second.
I'm so sorry.

1309
01:30:15,473 --> 01:30:18,237
Baby, I'm so sorry. Jenna, please...

1310
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,679
- Don't touch me!
- Listen to me for one second.

1311
01:30:22,414 --> 01:30:24,939
I mean it! I mean it!

1312
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:27,541
Get... Get away from me!

1313
01:30:29,487 --> 01:30:31,546
Where are you going to go, Jenna?

1314
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:33,249
Jenna?

1315
01:30:34,826 --> 01:30:36,987
- Get away from me!
- Listen to me!

1316
01:30:40,131 --> 01:30:41,257
Jenna?

1317
01:30:42,567 --> 01:30:44,967
Stop! I love you!

1318
01:31:03,722 --> 01:31:07,214
- Motherfucker.
- Jenna? Jenna?

1319
01:31:07,325 --> 01:31:09,691
Don't even think about coming
in the house. Michael, I mean it.

1320
01:31:09,794 --> 01:31:12,262
- Okay. I'm not gonna come inside.
- Damn right, you're not.

1321
01:31:12,364 --> 01:31:13,888
But I'm not gonna leave, either.

1322
01:31:13,999 --> 01:31:15,125
I'm not gonna leave, Jenna.

1323
01:31:15,233 --> 01:31:16,700
You're gonna have to come talk to me
sooner or later.

1324
01:31:16,801 --> 01:31:17,859
Go away!

1325
01:31:17,969 --> 01:31:20,164
I can't! I'm sorry. I can't.

1326
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:23,769
I love you, and I don't deserve you,
but this is our home.

1327
01:31:26,711 --> 01:31:28,838
This is our home, Jenna, and I'm...

1328
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:32,648
I'm not gonna leave this porch
until you talk to me.

1329
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:36,113
Jenna?

1330
01:32:19,497 --> 01:32:20,521
Hey.

1331
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:25,526
I'm not coming back.

1332
01:32:27,305 --> 01:32:28,465
I'm sorry.

1333
01:32:29,407 --> 01:32:33,400
But I'm moving into Kenny's.
I'm still gonna be his dad.

1334
01:32:35,013 --> 01:32:37,004
Okay. Good.

1335
01:32:40,118 --> 01:32:42,609
- Hey.
- You can start now.

1336
01:32:43,488 --> 01:32:44,477
Hi.

1337
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:48,452
Sorry?

1338
01:32:51,096 --> 01:32:52,154
Lise?

1339
01:32:52,897 --> 01:32:56,594
I'm exhausted, Chris.
Everything you need is in here.

1340
01:32:56,701 --> 01:33:01,138
You need anything else, call.
Otherwise, I will see you on Monday.

1341
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:12,948
I'm here, kid.

1342
01:33:14,452 --> 01:33:15,942
I'll never leave you.

1343
01:34:51,382 --> 01:34:53,976
Michael? Michael?

1344
01:34:56,254 --> 01:34:59,382
- It's sparkling!
- Thank you, Rjean.

1345
01:36:22,607 --> 01:36:23,733
Thank you.

1346
01:36:55,974 --> 01:36:58,568
Do you remember the day
my grandmother died?

1347
01:37:00,011 --> 01:37:01,171
Jenna?

1348
01:37:03,548 --> 01:37:07,575
Remember how they let me in
so that I could kiss her goodbye?

1349
01:37:10,621 --> 01:37:13,283
There was this pain in my heart that day

1350
01:37:15,226 --> 01:37:17,091
that I had never felt before,

1351
01:37:18,529 --> 01:37:21,293
and that I've never felt again until now.

1352
01:37:24,836 --> 01:37:29,136
I feel like I'm mourning the death of the
single most important thing in my life.

1353
01:37:33,878 --> 01:37:34,936
Us.

1354
01:37:37,148 --> 01:37:38,843
But we're not dead, Jenna.

1355
01:37:41,252 --> 01:37:43,846
We're not dead, baby.
We just have to go back.

1356
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:47,290
I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

1357
01:37:47,392 --> 01:37:50,828
Please love me enough to let us
go back to the way things were.

1358
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,991
I don't think I can, Michael.

1359
01:37:57,235 --> 01:38:00,762
Well, then, we'll start something new,
but we have to try, right?

1360
01:38:01,572 --> 01:38:03,199
How can we not try?

1361
01:38:07,678 --> 01:38:08,804
Jenna?

1362
01:38:11,482 --> 01:38:12,642
Jenna?
