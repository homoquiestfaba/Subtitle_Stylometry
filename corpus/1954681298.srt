build a dungeon and lock me up in it?

I'm your father, Damian, not your jailer.

- That's not what I mean.

Or is it? I don't know.

403
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,963
Maybe biological ties aren't enough
to make a man a father.

404

he felt like a prisoner in his own home.

I thought if he tried to leave again and saw
that there was nothing keeping him here...

412
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,127
that you did trust him, then...

413

Sometimes, you have to have
a little faith, sir.

There was a time when the Court of Owls
stood behind every wall, in every shadow.

that's for sure.

This is a monastery in the Himalayas.

882
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,260
I stayed there years ago...

883
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,886
when I was lost, troubled.

884
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,620
And the monks helped me in ways
that proved to be very...

885
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,848
I don't need any help.

886
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,850
But maybe I will later on.

887
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,051
I've got some packing to do.

888
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,260
BRUCE: Gotham P.D.'s collecting evidence
at the Court of Owls.

889
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,681
I suspected Samantha's involvement
early on.

890
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,931
S.T.A.R. Labs should have an analysis
of the talons' remains within the week.

(BRUCE SIGHS)

892
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,843
He needs this time
to find his own place in the world.

893
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,089
He's a 10-year-old boy.

894
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,282
No. He just looks like one.

895
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,442
There's not another child on Earth
like Damian Wayne.

896
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,500
When the time is right,
Damian will be back.

897
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,446
And it won't be because I want him to,
it'll be because he wants to.

898
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,122
And if you're wrong, sir?

899
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,370
Sometimes, Alfred,
you have to have a little faith.
