00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:07,403
And then when I heard
his car come in the driveway,

3
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:10,539
I would immediately bust into my
favorite "solid gold" dance moves.

4
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:11,907
- What's that?
- You don't know what...

5
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:13,409
It's like the best
dance show on television.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,543
- You don't know that?
- No.

7
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:16,044
Oh, I'm so bummed.

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,796
I'm learning so much
about you today, Patrick.

9
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:19,331
Oh, God.

10
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:22,384
Well, I would bust those moves,
I would run around the room,

11
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,137
my dad was so annoyed, he would
be like, "Patrick, calm down."

12
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,805
- "Shut the fuck up!"
- Exactly.

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,807
Or just, like, stop
dancing at least.

14
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:31,260
I couldn't help it, and then
I'd dance over to the door,

15
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:32,594
and there he was.

16
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:33,846
Your knight in shining armor.

17
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:35,481
My dad's best friend, Tony.

18
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:37,983
He was so hot.
He was so '90s.

19
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,601
He even drove
a bright red motorcycle.

20
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:40,936
- Of course he did.
- Right?

21
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:42,771
And when you're little,
you just are really happy,

22
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:44,506
but you don't
fully know exactly why.

23
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,825
- You just need to dance.
- Yes! Thank you!

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,569
I had a huge crush
on my dad's best

25
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,279
friend, Tony, and I
just needed to dance.

26
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,947
- Yeah, me too.
- You too?

27
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:55,784
When I was little, I was obsessed
with a boy band called "Take That".

28
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:56,785
Do you know them?

29
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:58,086
- No.
- They made it here? No?

30
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:59,371
Anyway, they were
like a British version

31
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:01,089
- of the backstreet boys.
- Oh.

32
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:02,791
And I remember the first time
I saw their pop video,

33
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:04,877
"do what u like,"
and looking back,

34
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:06,628
I mean it's literally
the gayest thing ever.

35
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,130
They're wearing
fringe leather jackets,

36
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:10,799
all prancing around rubbing
food into each other.

37
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,801
And I remember
the first time I watched it,

38
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:15,137
I sat in front of the TV,
getting ready for school,

39
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:17,556
eating my corn flakes,
and it pops up, and I thought,

40
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:19,942
"what the fuck is this?"
You know?

41
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:23,111
- Wow. I loved it.
- Amazing.

42
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:26,615
I even... I made up
a whole dance routine to it.

43
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:29,034
- You did not make up a dance.
- Do you wanna see it?

44
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:30,786
Uh, I need to see
your dance, yes, please.

45
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,404
Okay. Well, don't judge me,
I'm a little bit rusty.

46
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:33,622
Okay, no.
I wanna see it.

47
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,207
Oh, I'm already impressed.

48
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:39,244
Okay, well,
just give me a second.

49
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,663
- No, I'm not gonna do it.
- Oh!

50
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:43,248
- No, I'm too embarrassed.
- Come on.

51
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,836
No, not gonna do it, but I'm
gonna show you something else.

52
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:50,389
I wanted to see the dance.

53
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,975
Oh, okay, Booty dance,
that's fine, thank you.

54
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,510
- Ba-bum!
- Oh!

55
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:56,395
- That's the, uh...
- The game I told you about.

56
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:57,513
- Yeah, yeah.
- Top trumps.

57
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:59,398
Top trumps!
Yeah, I got them on eBay.

58
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:01,316
Oh, my God.

59
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,268
Even holding these cards again
makes me feel like a kid.

60
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,153
Well, you gotta teach
me how to play.

61
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:07,022
- What... the "circus of death"?
- Yeah.

62
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:08,907
- That's a very dark game.
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:10,692
- The "maggot."
- Hot.

64
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:12,411
The fit... oh, my God. These...

65
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:14,613
Oh, Jesus, Patrick,
look, it's nearly 2:30.

66
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:18,450
Oh, my God.
Godzilla in a pink bow tie?

67
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,702
I am obsessed with this art.

68
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:24,139
Yeah, get ready for the gayest
Dracula you've ever seen.

69
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,676
- Uh-oh. Oooh!
- Girl.

70
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,361
Patrick, there's
literally hundreds of these

71
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,013
you can get, anything
you can think of.

72
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:34,349
"Star wars," "Star trek,"
The Royal Family, Miley Cyrus.

73
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:35,717
- Wow.
- Cats.

74
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,937
- Amazing. Mmm,
- I'm surprised there isn't a gay one.

75
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:41,273
Well, why don't we make
a gay game like this?

76
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:43,942
For, I don't know, for iPhones?

77
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,352
Probably a bit busy
making first-person

78
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,728
shooters for straight men.

79
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:50,566
No, no, it could be like a
cage match for gay archetypes:

80
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:53,902
You'd have the "hot jock"
versus the "drag mother."

81
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:58,874
And then you could have, uh, "lusty
lads of London" against "gay for pay."

82
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:01,159
"Farm boy with big ideas."

83
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,545
Oh, come on, don't we need
something else in our lives?

84
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,497
Is this really why
we got into this industry?

85
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:09,084
I don't think gay novelty
games is the reason either.

86
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:12,421
Oh, the "ashamed gay."
Another card.

87
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:14,056
This game is practically
writing itself.

88
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,508
Patrick, it's
fucking ridiculous...

89
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:19,227
Which, of course, means it
would probably work. Right?

90
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:23,231
- So? What do you say?
- Yeah, let's do it.

91
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,083
- Yes!
- But listen,

92
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:26,835
the company will own
every idea we come up with.

93
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:28,103
So we'll need
to keep it on the sly.

94
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:31,106
But I know you can
keep a secret, so...

95
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,025
Sorry, Patrick,
that was bad taste.

96
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:37,112
No, I, uh...

97
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:39,114
I've been meaning
to tell you something.

98
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,750
What?

99
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:43,535
I told my friends.

100
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:46,955
You... you told
your friends about us?

101
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,425
Really? But just Dom and Agustín.
Nobody else.

102
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,348
What did they say?
Out of interest.

103
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:57,966
Actually, you know what?
I don't want to know.

104
00:03:58,017 --> 00:03:59,801
But they obviously think
I'm a prick, do they?

105
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:01,470
No, no, they don't
think you're a prick.

106
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:04,139
They don't even know you.

107
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,693
Yeah. Okay, come on.

108
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,195
Uh, you... you go on ahead,
I've got to, uh...

109
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,731
I gotta make that phone call.

110
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,784
Go...
Okay.

111
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:23,158
Where the fuck have you been?
I was... I went to a movie.

112
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,410
- In the middle of a workday?
- Yeah.

113
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:28,914
I had to, uh, refill the well
of my creative unconscious.

114
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:31,083
You read that
on some self-help blog?

115
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:32,735
No.

116
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,336
Well, what movie did
you pour in there?

117
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:36,171
They're, uh... "Showgirls."

118
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:38,674
- It's a revival thing with drag queens.
- At lunchtime?

119
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,059
Yeah, uh, Agustín's
friend organizes it.

120
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,562
It's, um,
it's at the McClintock.

121
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:46,431
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the McClintock.

122
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:48,734
What? Why?
You haven't heard?

123
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,436
- Bed bugs.
- What?

124
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:54,573
You can't let them hear you.
It's bed bugs.

125
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,525
Shut up.
Yeah, it's worse than ever.

126
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,193
Movie theaters,
hotels, you know,

127
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,912
I have a plastic suit I wear
if I'm going to either one.

128
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:03,532
- You do not.
- I do. I can get you one if you want.

129
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,784
You have a plastic...

130
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:09,254
Hey. Uh, yeah.

131
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,589
I gotta go.

132
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:12,708
- I'm worried about you.
- I'm worried about you!

133
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,459
You don't have a plastic suit.

134
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,095
Movie theaters, hotels.

135
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:26,888
So what do you think
about the "fag stag" card?

136
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,108
A straight guy that only
hangs out with gay men.

137
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,644
Did you say something to him?

138
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:36,064
Say something to who?
To Owen?

139
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,733
You two were just
whispering to each other.

140
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,367
Oh, yes, that.

141
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:41,570
No, I'm sorry, I just...
I was just telling him

142
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,790
about that nice, big,
juicy foreskin of yours.

143
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,128
Oh, Patrick, please
don't joke about this.

144
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:51,413
Of course I would never
say anything to Owen.

145
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:52,664
It's such a small city.

146
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:55,751
You tell someone and they happen to
mention it to their fucking dog Walker

147
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,920
and let it slip to
some Castro queen,

148
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:00,088
and suddenly it's all
over San Francisco.

149
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,975
I really don't want
that to happen. Okay?

150
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,929
Because...
I don't want this to end.

151
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,016
Okay, yeah.
I won't let anyone know.

152
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:14,069
I'm sorry. Just Dom
and Agustín know.

153
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:15,487
Okay? It stops there.

154
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:18,406
Cool. Sorry, I know
it's your friends, and...

155
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:21,943
- No, it's okay.
- I'm...

156
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:26,114
Okay, cool. Thanks.

157
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:30,452
You don't think that hotel
has bed bugs, do you?

158
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:35,040
- Huh?
- Hm? No. Nothing.

159
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:38,009
Okay, uh, have a good meeting.

160
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,928
- Thanks.
- Okay.

161
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,767
But we went to this, uh, this hotel,
it's called the Morwood Hotel.

162
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:49,888
- Oof! Shady lady.
- Oh, my God. That place is so gross.

163
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,439
Even I wouldn't
go there for a hook-up.

164
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:52,974
Were there cum stains
on the wall?

165
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:55,360
Come on, don't you guys
find seedy motels kinda sexy?

166
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:59,815
Not that place. It's been a
24-hour meth party since '97.

167
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:02,534
So do you guys just fuck
or do you talk too?

168
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:04,820
We talk all the time. We spend
most of every day together.

169
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:07,155
Well, what do you talk about?
Work doesn't count.

170
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:09,407
I don't know, whatever, normal things.
What do people talk about?

171
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,161
All kinds of things. We talk
about boy bands, our childhood.

172
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:15,497
What about Jon?
Where is he in this?

173
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:16,748
Yeah.
I don't know.

174
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,250
But what I do know
is that he and Jon

175
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:20,218
are having major problems.

176
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:23,672
And I know how that sounds,
like the worst TV show

177
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,223
you've ever seen,
but it's true.

178
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,474
And it's none
of my business, anyway.

179
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:28,426
So all we can do
is just live in the moment

180
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,729
- and stay open with each other.
- Wide open.

181
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:33,181
- Gross.
- Who paid for the room?

182
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:34,816
- He did.
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,852
You're like Julia Roberts
in pretty woman.

184
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:40,130
Yep, shine up those
fierce thigh highs, Paddy.

185
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:41,022
You're his dirty
little secret.

186
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:42,858
Well, secrets are
freaking sexy. And, look,

187
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:44,693
I know it's because
you guys love me

188
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,661
and you don't want to see me get
hurt, but this is happening.

189
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:49,030
So just try and see it
from my perspective, okay?

190
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:53,034
Don't speculate, don't judge,
just be supportive.

191
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:55,420
I'm gonna be fine.
Really.

192
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:57,831
You know what, Paddy?
I'm happy for you

193
00:07:57,832 --> 00:08:00,208
that you're getting
nailed in your p-spot.

194
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,711
Well, thank you.
Me too.

195
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:06,581
And now you finally have someone
to bring home to mommie dearest.

196
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:12,921
- It's a good neighborhood.
- It is, yeah.

197
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,806
- Yeah. I feel like it's up-and-coming.
- Totally.

198
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,257
It is, totally, and there's
a lot of people who...

199
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,893
- Confess your sins!
- Wow!

200
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,562
Fucking Jesus.
Okay.

201
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:23,932
Oh, my God. He's gonna work for me.
Kidding.

202
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:29,270
So... here it is.

203
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:32,774
- It's this?
- Yeah, this is it. It's cool, huh?

204
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:35,276
- It's very cool.
- Confess your sins!

205
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,163
So this is where
the chicken comes out?

206
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:41,032
Yeah, we'll build a little
counter here and then an awning,

207
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,618
and, uh, there will
be a couple benches here,

208
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,038
and maybe a parklet
when I get the permits.

209
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,707
Yeah. How much does it
cost to start it up?

210
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:52,377
- It's much less than a restaurant.
- Like $10,000?

211
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:53,845
Well, the kitchen
doesn't really exist yet.

212
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:55,263
So we'll have to
build that out.

213
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:56,548
It's like $20k?

214
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:00,301
And the landlord wants six
months up front, so I need...

215
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:02,353
- 80. Which is not that much.
- $80,000!

216
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:04,139
Confess your sins!

217
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,107
He's fucking the boss
behind his boyfriend's back.

218
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:08,059
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm confessing your sins.

219
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,361
You can't do that! Homeless
people have Twitter accounts.

220
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,313
- Guys, focus.
- Sorry.

221
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:14,149
- Do you love it?
- It's great.

222
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:15,366
- Right?
- Yeah.

223
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:16,534
Why don't I get
a picture of the two of you

224
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:17,652
- in front of it.
- Great idea.

225
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,320
And, uh, then
we can get out of here.

226
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,139
- Think positive thoughts.
- Okay, yes.

227
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,657
Okay.
Flash that 80k smile.

228
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,242
Say chicken!

229
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:26,661
- Chicken!
- Money!

230
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:28,163
- Margaritzis.
- Yay.

231
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:30,331
- Here's to you, Patrick.
- Thank you.

232
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,917
So, Patrick, how's the affair?

233
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:35,970
Really? I didn't know it was
a secret until just now.

234
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:37,305
It's an affair!

235
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,642
I don't know if you know this,
I had an affair once.

236
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:45,680
Uh, it was with a vet, okay?
Not a, uh, veteran, a veterinarian.

237
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:46,748
It was fantastic.
Okay, sorry. Whatever.

238
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:47,815
Okay, zip it, Doris.

239
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,150
As long as
you're having fun,

240
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:49,851
- good for you.
- Thank you.

241
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,653
Hey, hey, hey,
someone's checking us out.

242
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:53,571
- Yeah, he's checking us out.
- Oh, my goodness.

243
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,074
- Oh, yeah, big time.
- Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

244
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:58,026
- We're not even at a gay bar!
- That's a lot of man.

245
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,611
It might need
to be a group effort.

246
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:02,163
Hey, I have to go to the bathroom.
Dom, will you join me?

247
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:04,532
- Oh, fun.
- All right.

248
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,367
All right. Have fun.

249
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,086
- Yeah.
- Bye.

250
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,421
I'm glad I bothered
to brush my teeth.

251
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:13,341
It's... I think it's... I don't
think it's anything, Paddy.

252
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,760
No, look, it's those little
red bumps right there.

253
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:17,128
- No, it's...
- I hope it's not bed bugs.

254
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,713
I see it,
but it's not bed bugs,

255
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:20,048
I think it's just
from scratching.

256
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,432
Leave it alone.
Stop touching it.

257
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,017
It wasn't there this morning,
you know?

258
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,053
We went to that hotel
and then did whatever,

259
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:27,772
and then we played
Top Trumps on the F line and then...

260
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:30,725
Top trumps? Is that like
bumping donuts for tops?

261
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:33,394
No, it's a British card game
he wanted me to play.

262
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,613
- It was actually really sweet.
- Aww.

263
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:36,848
It's definitely
not AIDS, right?

264
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:38,733
Oh, come on, you make
everything about AIDS.

265
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:40,201
I do not make
everything about AIDS.

266
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:41,736
Oh, remember
gay Channing Tatum?

267
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:44,572
Well, that was different. That
was a legitimate AIDS situation.

268
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:47,542
I had just had my wisdom teeth pulled
out and it was totally possible

269
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:49,244
that my gums hadn't healed
before I blew him.

270
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:51,496
Was that before or after the
time your asshole was so tight

271
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,414
it sucked the condom
off that guy's dick?

272
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:54,916
- That really happened!
- Really?

273
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,843
- Yes.
- Listen, have another

274
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,720
Margarita and
enjoy the evening.

275
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:01,956
- Your AIDS crisis is over.
- You're probably right. I'm crazy.

276
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:06,094
- Maybe it's just a spider bite?
- Maybe.

277
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:13,451
Here we go.

278
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:15,270
- Ah! Another round!
- Oh, God!

279
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:17,272
No, I can't do another.
I'm not paying for this one.

280
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:18,966
- Why don't you get it?
- Okay. As soon as

281
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,658
I get a job, I'll
get another round,

282
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,610
and I'll get you a new haircut.
Huh? How does that sound?

283
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,612
You know, why don't I get
you a job at the hospital.

284
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,431
But you'd have
to change some catheters,

285
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:28,032
which actually I think
would be perfect for you,

286
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,534
it would be so real
and gritty and help inspire

287
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:31,286
your next new body of work.
How about that?

288
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,788
- My art practice is over, so...
- No! Oh, no!

289
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,623
Don't do that to the world!
How cruel!

290
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:39,594
- Fuck you, hagsville.
- You did not just call me a hag, fag!

291
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,129
- I actually did.
- Did you really?

292
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:42,930
Hey, hey! Enough
with the hags and fags.

293
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:46,267
- Unbelievable!
- Is everything okay over here?

294
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:47,928
Oh, yes. Oh, no, we're
good, thank you for checking.

295
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:49,554
We're having a heart circle.

296
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:52,273
We're just, you know, we're sharing
and being honest with each other.

297
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:53,133
Oh, it's very healing.

298
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:54,809
You guys are using
shots of Tequila?

299
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,311
- Yeah.
- How'd that work out?

300
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:59,981
I've been unburdened.
I feel fantastic.

301
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:02,200
Have we met before?

302
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:05,320
Um, at the symphony gala maybe?

303
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,488
Um, um...

304
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,158
Uh, yeah, maybe.

305
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,242
Oh, that's totally possible.

306
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:13,127
How funny, you know,
I actually do, yes.

307
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:14,379
- Yeah.
- Hi.

308
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,547
- Hi. Malik.
- Hi, I'm Doris.

309
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:18,549
She's just so rude sometimes.

310
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:20,193
I know, she always
just says the first

311
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,803
unfiltered thing that
pops into her head,

312
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:23,671
which, by the way,
is usually wrong.

313
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:24,493
Oh, I know!

314
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,808
Like the thing she said
about me and Kevin, right?

315
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:29,143
Technically, we are not
actually having an affair.

316
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:30,678
Yeah, but you are.
Technically it is an affair...

317
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,431
No, technically he is
having an affair. Not me.

318
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:35,016
I don't think that's
exactly true, Paddy.

319
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,851
No, that's completely true.
And also, by the way,

320
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,070
- this has nothing to do with my mom.
- What?

321
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:41,322
What you said before
about Kevin and my mom.

322
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:43,408
Oh, that. I mean,
maybe just a little bit.

323
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:44,992
No, no, no, no, no,
it's not like that anymore.

324
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:47,612
I genuinely, really,
actually like him.

325
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:50,365
Which, honestly, it seems like
it's making everything even worse.

326
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,034
And, truly, I also think that
that is why the word affair

327
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:56,204
is starting to feel
kind of shitty to me.

328
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,172
Fuck, maybe Doris is right.

329
00:12:58,207 --> 00:12:59,207
I don't know what
I'm doing right now.

330
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:01,209
Can you please
tell me what to do?

331
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,960
I'm sorry, Paddy.
I love you, I adore you,

332
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,679
but I can't go on one of
your spirals right now.

333
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:05,405
Oh, no, come on.
I just need to talk it out.

334
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:06,097
No, not tonight.

335
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:08,516
No, I wanna find Eddie
and dance with some bears.

336
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,886
- Find who?
- From the Russian River.

337
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,154
Love you long time.

338
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:14,722
Are you sure you should
be going out tonight?

339
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:16,941
Yes.

340
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:30,238
Hello. Would you
like to get tested?

341
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,489
- Hmm?
- Would you like to get tested?

342
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,040
- Me?
- Yeah.

343
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:39,213
I'm good.
Yeah. Thank you.

344
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,082
Sure.

345
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,092
- I love your shirt.
- Thank you.

346
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:11,496
Hey! Remember me?
Have you seen Eddie?

347
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:27,428
Oh!

348
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,886
Oh, my God.

349
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:52,236
Oh, my God.

350
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,287
Nobody important?

351
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:55,573
No, Patrick's having
a meltdown tonight.

352
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:58,376
You just gotta
let him cycle out.

353
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,877
The more he...
You tell him he's okay,

354
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:02,713
the more he finds reasons
that you're wrong.

355
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:04,549
That thing with his boss?

356
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,917
Yeah. No, I'm good.

357
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:07,668
Yeah, he has a little rash.

358
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,054
And he's convinced
that he has AIDS.

359
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:12,673
I have a good dermatologist.

360
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:16,060
That doesn't offend you,
irrational AIDS panic?

361
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:18,563
No, sir.

362
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:22,266
Jesus, Jack can talk.
I'm exhausted.

363
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,355
Oh, and he wants to know
everything about where you're at.

364
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:32,994
Your window. I said, "Jack, why
don't you just ask him yourself?"

365
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:37,448
- Do you miss him?
- Who?

366
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:42,119
Brian. I saw your photo
album at the house.

367
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,873
He was very handsome.

368
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,094
Of course I miss him.

369
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:51,846
You guys, um,

370
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,382
you guys remember to turn
off the hot water heater?

371
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,717
Uh, yeah.

372
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,185
Set the alarm?

373
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,222
Yes. We went through
the entire checklist, twice.

374
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:03,724
Fuck anyone?

375
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,728
Are we really
talking about this?

376
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,447
Well, yeah, why not?

377
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:11,899
I mean, if we're
going to be open,

378
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,235
there's no space for jealousy.
We... we talked about this.

379
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:16,904
I just, I didn't know
we were going into specifics.

380
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:19,073
Oh, okay.

381
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:21,208
Did you fuck anyone
on the bedspread?

382
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:24,045
The one from Santa Fe,
'cause it's so hard to clean.

383
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,247
No, we didn't
fuck on the bedspread.

384
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,716
- Oh.
- Or on the rug from Turkey.

385
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,919
Or on the beautiful credenza
from design within reach.

386
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,221
Relax.

387
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:36,507
Relax. I just wanna know
if you had a good time.

388
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:39,260
- Oh.
- And exactly

389
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:42,930
what kind of
a good time you had.

390
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,982
- Exactly.
- Really?

391
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:47,401
And where.

392
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,450
Um, uh... s...

393
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,534
- Scotty.
- Yeah.

394
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:06,087
- Yeah. How you been, Agustín?
- What's up, man?

395
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:08,956
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm all right,
I'm all right. How are you?

396
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:12,627
Uh... you look good, you look
really... you look really good.

397
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,262
I heard you and Frank
had a horrible breakup.

398
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:19,016
Yeah, yeah, it just turns out we
wanted different things, so...

399
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:23,304
You, uh...
Who told you about it?

400
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:25,690
- Frank.
- Oh.

401
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:28,976
- You see him much?
- All the time.

402
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:31,646
Oh. That's cool.

403
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:36,067
So what's up with you?

404
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:38,285
Uh, me and some buddies,

405
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,122
we're working on this thing,
uh, out in LA, actually.

406
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:43,207
- I might head there soon.
- Oh, nice, man.

407
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:45,543
Yeah.

408
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:47,578
Hi, can I have a water, please?

409
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,880
- Here you go.
- Not drinking tonight?

410
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:54,885
No, GHB doesn't really play well
with others, so...

411
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,504
You mind sharing?

412
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:58,556
Have you been drinking tonight?

413
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,808
Stone cold.

414
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,512
Maybe a drop.

415
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:11,235
To Dolly.
Cheers.

416
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:13,654
Whoo!

417
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:44,852
I know this guy.

418
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:50,057
Yo, Agustín!

419
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:52,693
Yo, man,
wake the fuck up, dude.

420
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:55,062
Richie! What's up, man?

421
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,313
What's up, man?

422
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:57,865
You're a fucking mess,
dude, here.

423
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,985
Clean yourself up, dude.

424
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:04,238
You know it.

425
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,412
- I think he's fine.
- Ugh.

426
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:13,247
All right.

427
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:15,049
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

428
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,385
Yo, I know that guy.

429
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,138
- No, you don't, Kyah.
- No, I fuckin' know that guy.

430
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,923
He works at the Chipotle
by the mall.

431
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:24,842
You think everyone
works at that Chipotle.

432
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:27,678
No I think that guy
works at the chipotle, Brady.

433
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:30,514
He screws up my burrito bowls.

434
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:35,986
There are some skin
conditions associated with HIV.

435
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,072
But again, I must emphasize,

436
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:40,658
I can't make any diagnosis of
your condition over the phone.

437
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:42,860
No, I know you can't diagnose
anything over the phone,

438
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:44,679
but I was wondering
if you had any

439
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,447
scientific data of
my, you know, chances?

440
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,783
Have you had
unprotected anal sex?

441
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,252
No, no, that would
be crazy to do that.

442
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:55,339
We strongly advise that anyone with
concerns about exposure get tested.

443
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,541
Would you like me to look up
testing sites in your area?

444
00:19:57,592 --> 00:19:59,426
Oh, no, that's okay.
I live in San Francisco,

445
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,961
they give them out
like coffee stirrers.

446
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:04,265
Great. Is there anything
else I can help you with?

447
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,851
You have a very comforting
voice, do people tell you that?

448
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:09,603
It's kind of like
a young Angela Lansbury,

449
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:10,805
which I don't know
if that makes any sense,

450
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:12,640
but we were a big
"Murder, She Wrote" family.

451
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:15,059
Oh, honey, who wasn't.

452
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,646
Uh, Noelle, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

453
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:33,043
- Hi.
- Hey, Patrick.

454
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:37,665
What are you doing here?

455
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,836
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

456
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:44,171
- Paddy.
- Are you okay?

457
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:45,673
I'm good, brother, I'm good.

458
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:47,174
Where did you find him?

459
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:49,844
He was in soma passed out
by a pupusa cart.

460
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,098
All right, onto the bed.

461
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,569
Richie...

462
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,447
What was that?

463
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:13,534
Nothing, just drunk talk.

464
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:18,255
So, how's the shop?

465
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,758
Good, busy.

466
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,960
How's work for you?

467
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:25,212
Complicated.

468
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,847
I'm sorry to hear.

469
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:29,049
But I really like
the new desks they got us.

470
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,469
I can raise and lower
them now, so I can work

471
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,888
standing up if I want
to, which is cool.

472
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:35,556
Now we both work standing up.

473
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:38,309
That's right, we do!

474
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,362
You know, they say you're more
productive when you're standing up.

475
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:44,565
- No shit.
- That's what they say.

476
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:50,454
Are you seeing anyone?
No.

477
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:53,624
Mm. Delete, delete, delete.

478
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,328
Are you?

479
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,413
No. I'm...

480
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:04,418
Uh... I'm not really
seeing anyone.

481
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:07,755
So, you're just
barely seeing someone?

482
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:10,591
No.
I mean I'm not seeing

483
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:13,348
anyone at all, full stop.

484
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:16,605
Can we get lunch sometime?

485
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:21,936
Uh, no,
but thanks for the offer.

486
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:23,437
I should go, my friends
are waiting for me.

487
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,521
No, just lunch, just lunch.

488
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:26,357
No agenda,
no expectation of anything,

489
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:27,441
and it can be
whenever you want.

490
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,827
It can be next week
or next year,

491
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,746
but hopefully before next year.

492
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,034
I'll think about it.

493
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:39,870
Okay.
I'll walk you out.

494
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:42,089
No need.

495
00:22:42,123 --> 00:22:44,174
Thanks for the tea.

496
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:49,096
Thanks again.

497
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
Good night!

498
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:32,389
- All right, a little prick.
- Okay.

499
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:41,982
Actually I have to...
I have to confess something.

500
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:45,185
I lied on the form outside.

501
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:48,072
I have had unprotected sex.

502
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:51,075
- How long ago?
- Uh, six weeks ago.

503
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:53,277
- Just once?
- Just one time.

504
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:54,828
And I'm pretty sure
that he's negative.

505
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:57,581
And when he came...
When he came,

506
00:23:57,665 --> 00:24:01,201
he came, like, on my...
He came on my body.

507
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:03,754
He didn't cum in my...
In myself.

508
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:06,090
So I think it should be fine,

509
00:24:06,124 --> 00:24:07,958
and I just, I'm really...

510
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:10,461
I'm sorry,
I don't know why I did it.

511
00:24:10,512 --> 00:24:12,963
People make mistakes.

512
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,138
So these tests,

513
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:22,773
they find the virus
pretty quickly now, right?

514
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:24,975
Oh, we don't actually
test for the virus itself.

515
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:28,228
We test for your body's
response to the virus.

516
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,782
The way that a pregnancy test measures
your body's response to a baby.

517
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:34,902
"Hey, everyone
I'm pregnant... with HIV!"

518
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:47,081
Tell me what you see.

519
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:56,807
Hey.

520
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:59,259
Uh, you can't come in and
tease me like this, Patrick.

521
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,311
- Lunch is still hours away.
- I'm not hungry.

522
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:03,564
Fantastic. Neither am I.

523
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:06,934
I lost my appetite when I
was getting my HIV test.

524
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,770
Why were you getting
an HIV test?

525
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:10,904
Because I freaked out.

526
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,940
Because this is clearly
freaking me out.

527
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:14,491
- What is?
- This, us,

528
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:16,860
sitting in this glass box
pretending we're not fucking.

529
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:18,779
Okay, hold on.

530
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,534
- What is your status?
- I'm negative.

531
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:25,452
What about you? I don't even know
if you're positive or negative.

532
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:27,254
Jesus Christ.
Um, I'm negative, Patrick,

533
00:25:27,288 --> 00:25:28,672
does that make you
feel any better?

534
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:30,624
No, actually, it doesn't.

535
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:34,294
Kevin, what are we doing?

536
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:37,631
- I don't know.
- Well, I don't know either,

537
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:39,299
but why do I feel
so alone in this?

538
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,219
Well, you're not alone in this,
Patrick, because I'm a fucking mess.

539
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,720
Okay? I'm getting
these migraines,

540
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:45,772
which I've not had
since I was a kid,

541
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:48,125
which come to think
about it was the last

542
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:50,444
time I had to hide
how I was feeling.

543
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:52,479
Well, I'm sorry that
you're having migraines,

544
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,064
but that does make me
feel a little bit better.

545
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:57,034
Jesus.

546
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,486
You're not alone in this.

547
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:03,240
Next time you freak out, don't
fucking panic and have an AIDS test.

548
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:05,492
Just call me. Okay?

549
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,828
Okay.

550
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:18,055
I remembered the, um...

551
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:21,341
The dance moves to my routine.

552
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,513
Your routine?

553
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:29,483
Do you want to see it?

554
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:32,486
- Now?
- Yeah.

555
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:36,240
- Yeah.
- Really?

556
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:37,691
Fuck it.

557
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:41,361
All right, this is for you.

558
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:49,870
- Okay, shh, I need to concentrate.

Yes, it was.
