00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,981
EP. 1— THE PASTMASTER ALWAYS
RINGS TWICE

2
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:29,417
Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea, Tom.
This old boneyard is supposed to be cursed!

3
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:36,583
What are ya, Jack, a scaredy kat? We find somethin’
valuable, and the museum’ll pay big bucks for it!

4
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,333
So shut up and keep diggin’!

5
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:46,648
Hey, I think I’ve hit paydirt!
Gimme a hand here!

6
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,919
There’s probably treasure inside.

7
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:09,632
Ugliest treasure I’ve ever seen…

8
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:20,742
Yeah, well this old watch has
gotta be worth plenty of- What?!

9
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,180
Wh-who are you?

10
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,579
I am the Pastmaster, imprisoned
in here for 800 years.

11
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,060
I told ya this place was cursed!

12
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:42,606
At last I’m finally free! Now to
find my book of spells.

13
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:45,305
L-L-Let’s get outta here!

14
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:52,336
No way! We’re gonna sell that old
gnome to the museum, watch and all!

15
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:01,775
Curse the council!
My book isn’t where I hid it!

16
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:07,045
- You’re comin’ with us, Pastmaster!
- You foolish mortals!

17
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:14,619
Even without my spellbook I have enough
power to deal with vermin like you!

18
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,384
Let them go!

19
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:49,738
I have more important work for you.
Start digging, and find my book of spells!

20
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,948
You are violating a restricted area! Put
down those shovels! You’re under arrest!

21
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:08,705
Do those modern fools think some
infernal machine can stop me?! Attack!

22
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,761
- Do we read these things their rights?
- You have the right to remain buried!

23
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,837
These bones ain’t movin’ now.
What’s this thing?

24
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:33,742
I don’t know. Headquarters wants us to
take it over to the Museum of History.

25
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:35,311
Roger.

26
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:46,024
Perhaps this “museum” has my book.

27
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:01,058
So, this is what’s
been accomplished in 800 years.

28
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:10,119
I want the Dark Ages back! And when I
find my Tome of Time, I will arrange just that!

29
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,339
Mach 4! Ready for more?!

30
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:26,806
Mach 5!

31
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:44,807
All right, ten seconds.
Beat that, SWAT Kat.

32
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:54,122
- What?
- New personal best! Ten seconds at Mach 5.

33
00:05:55,246 --> 00:06:00,998
Yeah, well, if you say so.
Of coruse, I didn’t see it.

34
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:04,000
Sure you didn’t see it, you were
out like like a blown engine!

35
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:11,450
Then how do I know you made 10 sec.? I mean,
you could’ve passed out too, and just made it up to yank my tail.

36
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:17,089
That does it! Two outta three!

37
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,028
You’re on!

38
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:35,708
Why don’t ya just admit it! I can
take more Gs than you!

39
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:38,331
I’ll believe it when I see it!

40
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:43,045
And so when the museum re-opens,
our new exhibit will trace...

41
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,372
...the evoloution of Megakat City from
prehistoric swamp, to urban sprawl.

42
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:49,498
This should be enough for me to
write the Mayor’s press release.

43
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:52,423
Thanks, Dr. Sinian.
Will that be in the exhibit?

44
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,153
Oh, just came in, but it’s definatly
a part of history. The darker part.

45
00:06:57,781 --> 00:07:00,467
These inscriptions date back to
the Dark Ages.

46
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,549
Really? Any idea what was inside?

47
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,716
Jewels, perhaps. Who knows what
our ancestors might have buried in here?

48
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:21,374
Here, the past is dead.
I prefer my past alive!

49
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:29,272
How’d you get in here?
The museum is closed until further...

50
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:31,191
And I say it is open!

51
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:48,748
What was that?!

52
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,400
I do not want to be disturbed while
I look for my book!

53
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:03,072
Oh good heavens!
One of the exhibits has fallen!

54
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,384
One of the exhibits is alive!

55
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,594
Where is my book?!

56
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:33,432
Jake! Callie’s callin’ us!

57
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,291
Oh and by the way, eleven
seconds at Mach 5!

58
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:52,792
T-Bone here. What’s happening, Ms.
Briggs? Ms. Briggs, do you copy?

59
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:57,229
Sounds like big trouble!

60
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,292
- What?
- Up and at ‘em, partner!

61
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:34,494
- Got a fix on Callie’s signal?
- Yes! Megakat City Museum of History!

62
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:39,856
We can get out through the garage!

63
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:47,594
Seems pretty quiet.

64
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,159
Quiet?

65
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,343
Popping canopy, now!

66
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:19,532
Bingo!

67
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,690
Let me give ya a hand, ladies.

68
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:33,284
T-Bone!

69
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,723
Thanks, Razor. I think I
could’be taken him.

70
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:49,800
Just makin’ sure the cement
machine gun was operational.

71
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:56,272
Exhibits are gettin’ kinda lifelike,
aren’t they?

72
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:04,525
Looks like the Enforcers are here,
late as usual.

73
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:17,652
My Tome of Time. 800 years is far
to long to be separated from such power!

74
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:29,276
Only a sorcerer’s dark power could have brought these
ancient bones to life. It must have been the Pastmaster.

75
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:36,504
- Do you mean that weird little guy in the hood?
- He’s stolen an ancient spellbook!

76
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:41,349
- All right, buddy, hand it over!
- The Tome of Time belongs to me!

77
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:47,071
Hear the spell  of this immortal, send
this creature through the portal!

78
00:11:58,348 --> 00:12:00,184
It’s a Megasaurus Rex!

79
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:13,665
Out of my way, you fools! I command the
past, and your future looks bleak!

80
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:19,779
Hang tight, we’ll take care of this.

81
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,822
- Let’s kick some tail!
- Roger! Octopus Missiles, away!

82
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:46,384
It just kicked our tails!

83
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:58,122
- The SWAT Kats!
- They’re gone!

84
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,946
Now who will save Megakat City?!

85
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:15,040
Come on, baby! Gotcha!

86
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,343
T-Bone? I’ve got a feeling we’re
not in Megakat City anymore.

87
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:26,914
Yeah, sleepin’ beauty, looks like that
giant lizard smashed us into the past.

88
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,636
Any idea how to get back?

89
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:36,198
Well, I’ve got a better question. How
does a jet stay in the air without fuel?

90
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,479
Answer: it doesn’t!

91
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,730
Well, I’d better get to work fixing
that torn fuel line.

92
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:55,388
Fine. The closest gas station is
only a million years away.

93
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,260
- Ejektors!
- Engaged!

94
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,293
- I guess we showed them.
- Yes, but now we have to show them!

95
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:28,229
Fire!

96
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:39,097
There is a way to destroy this modern monstrosity
called Megakat City, and bring back the Dark Ages!

97
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:49,418
It’s no use, Commander! We’ve
thrown everything at that lizard!

98
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:55,096
- I’m surprised SWAT Kats aren’t here.
- They got taken out early, sir.

99
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:59,576
Really? Well, we can handle this.
Launch gas grenades!

100
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:01,654
Yes sir!

101
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:06,474
The spell must be cast from the
tallest clocktower in the land.

102
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,834
Once that was my tower, but now...

103
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,249
- You stupid beast!
- They’re not going anywhere!

104
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,040
- Get that spellbook from the Pastmaster.
- I give the orders around here!

105
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:37,710
Dr. Sinian knows what she’s talking
about. She’s the curator of the museum.

106
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:40,931
All right. Throw a net over that guy!

107
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:46,353
Hear the spell of this immortal, send
these creatures through the portal!

108
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,977
- Too little too late, Feral!
- This is Feral. Bring me chopper backup!

109
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:07,449
Yes, that clocktower will do nicely!

110
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:11,477
He’s headed for City Hall!

111
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:35,310
Spider Missiles, now! Goin’ down!

112
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:43,853
T-Bone, follow me!

113
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:48,729
Into a live volcano?! Razor,
you’re crazier than I am!

114
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:03,000
Oxygen masks, now!

115
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,593
Lucky for us those leather-wings
don’t have gas masks.

116
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:18,979
Smells like prehistoric fried chicken.

117
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:32,229
Volcano was fun, but I don’t wanna spend the
rest of my nine lives stuck in dinosaurville.

118
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,699
Affirmative. And I’ve got an idea that just
might get the Turbokat back in the air.

119
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:45,167
- Let me blast that gnome and his buzzards.
- I give the orders around here, Feral...

120
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:51,949
and you’re not going to blow up my City Hall,
until I know who we’re dealing with and what he wants!

121
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,605
He’s an 800-year-old sorcerer
from the Dark Ages!

122
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:02,168
Perfect! Well, don’t just stand there! Get
up to the tower and find out what he wants!

123
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:06,075
Fuel tanks are modified.

124
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:12,371
- Give me some gas!
- You really think this is gonna work?

125
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:22,262
Theoretically, the natural volcanic gas mixture
should get us off the ground. Or blow us up.

126
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:34,066
When this clocktower strikes noon, my Dark Age
city will return, and your Megakat City will be no more!

127
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:43,631
The Mayor has authorized me to give you
anything you want! Money! A parade in your honor!

128
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:48,410
How generous. But I’m already getting
what I want! A return to the past!

129
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:53,203
- Our only hope is to destroy that book!
- And we’re running out of time!

130
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,546
You’re really going to enjoy the
Dark Ages!

131
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:08,263
Guess it’s up to Feral now, especially
without the SWAT Kats.

132
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:16,078
- Maybe we should’ve tried the unleaded volcano.
- Well, at least we didn’t blow up.

133
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,794
Feeding time again, guys?

134
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:24,983
Sorry, SWAT Kat
ain’t on the menu!

135
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:32,267
T-Bone! Looks like another one of
those time holes is opening.

136
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:48,673
Feral, you’ve got only three minutes to
blast that sorcerer out of the clocktower!

137
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:53,483
My pleasure! Fool should’ve
given the order an hour ago.

138
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,608
Get them!

139
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:14,095
My office!

140
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:26,705
It won’t be long, now!

141
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:33,486
- We’re back!
- The SWAT Kats!

142
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,641
Looks like our city’s having
an identity crisis.

143
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:43,165
SWAT Kats, you have only one minute to blast
the Pastmaster out of the City Hall clocktower!

144
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:45,674
Who says we can’t fight City Hall?

145
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:52,861
Eat afterburner!

146
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,064
Watch this!

147
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,833
If the Gs don’t knock you out!

148
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:16,393
Nice flying, T-Bone! Hey! I didn’t pass out!
Wake up, buddy! We need a pilot now!

149
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:24,831
- Why didn’t you eject?
- And miss that look on your face? No way!

150
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:26,895
They’re too late!

151
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:39,332
Time’s up!

152
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:42,602
Nooooo!

153
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:49,363
I wish they’d got back in time
to save my office.

154
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:53,050
I guess the Tome of Time won’t be
making it into the new exhibit.

155
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,051
But, at least we don’t have to worry
about the Pastmaster anymore.

156
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,863
- Yeah!
- Rock and roll!

157
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:41,492
Episode 2
THE GIANT BACTERIA

158
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,049
Does that crazy megalo think he can
blow up every refinery in Megakat City?

159
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:29,664
He’s doin’ a good job so far.

160
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:55,995
He’s shreddin’ those Enforcer choppers like
an old scratchin’ post! Guess it’s up to the SWAT
Kats to kick some tail!

161
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:04,289
- Can ya get a lock on him?
- Workin’ on it.

162
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,768
Locked and loaded, T-Bone!
One Octopus Missile, on its way!

163
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,707
Sucker doesn’t even see it comin’!

164
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:21,127
He suckered us!

165
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,665
How’d you miss him, sure-shot?

166
00:25:25,978 --> 00:25:28,348
That guy must have eyes in the
back of his head.

167
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:39,050
Whoa, he does have eyes in
the back of his head!

168
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:40,833
No excuses.

169
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,458
You’ll have to do better than that,
SWAT Kats, to catch Morbulus!

170
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:53,207
So, four-eyes wants to play
canyon tag, huh? Crud!

171
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:08,573
- He’s goin’ after the Megakat Refinery!
- Head for that cloud bank, I’ve got an idea!

172
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,868
I hope it’s better than your aim.

173
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:16,621
Scratch one more refinery!

174
00:26:23,461 --> 00:26:26,710
Let’s see if four-eyes has eyes
under his head! Bingo!

175
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:58,258
What’ll it be, Razor?
Dunk or deliver?

176
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:00,120
Dunk!

177
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,202
Belly flop?

178
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,928
Mega-belly flop! Guess Feral and
the Enforcers can handle it from here.

179
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,898
Keep away, Deputy Mayor!
He could still be dangerous!

180
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:36,057
Yes, he could be. If he was here.

181
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,806
Looks like you’ve come up empty,
Commander Feral. And the SWAT Kats
practically gave him to you!

182
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:51,273
If they’d held Morbulus until
we arrived, he’d be in custody right now!

183
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:09,726
Mayor Manx, is this the end of what has
been dubbed “The Refinery Reign of Terror?”

184
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,035
Absolutely! The authorities have
apprehended the villain!

185
00:28:16,276 --> 00:28:18,536
Mayor Manx, I’m afraid that’s
not the case.

186
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,743
- But Callie, you told me on the phone...
- You were obviously misinformed!

187
00:28:24,943 --> 00:28:27,227
Well, which is it, Commander?
Do you have this wacko or don’t you?

188
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:35,005
Despite our valiant efforts, the
villain managed to escape. Although, we
believe he may have drowned in the bay.

189
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,681
No way I’m gonna rot in some
Megakat City prison!

190
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:48,625
I’ll put you to much better use
than that!

191
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:36,032
Chalk up another one for the
SWAT Kats!

192
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:41,750
- Nice flyin’.
- Nice shootin’.

193
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,992
Fun’s over.

194
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:00,147
Back to the greasepit.

195
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,314
Let’s see if we made the 5:00 news.

196
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:18,378
- Hey, there’s Feral.
- Guy looks like he hasn’t hit
the litterbox in a week!

197
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:23,911
Turn it up, I wanna here him take
credit for what we did.

198
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,557
So you don’t have Morbulus
in custody?

199
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:32,178
Due to the interference of the SWAT Kats,
this is all we have of Morbulus at the moment!

200
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,115
- What?!
- What?!

201
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:39,107
No one asked for their help and they
allowed a dangerous criminal to escape!

202
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:43,806
Escape?! We practically
handed Feral a gift package!

203
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:47,867
And if I ever find out who they are,
I’ll...

204
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:53,610
Aw, great. Morbulus is gone,
so’s our TV!

205
00:30:57,324 --> 00:31:01,493
I need your help, guys. This crate
pinged all the way from Megakat Bay.

206
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,743
- What were you doin' there, Callie?
- Didn’t you guys hear?

207
00:31:09,057 --> 00:31:12,639
The SWAT Kats shot down
Morbulus! They were magnificent!

208
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:15,297
- Really?
- They tore him right out of his plane!

209
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:17,172
- Nu.
- Yes!

210
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,368
But somehow Commander Feral
managed to lose him…

211
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:25,273
- Yeah, so we heard. When we had a TV.
- When can I pick up the car?

212
00:31:25,775 --> 00:31:31,014
Jake’ll start on it right away.
You can wait for it, how ’bout some milk?

213
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:37,682
I can’t. I’ve got to get  back into town and
help “his Honor” write his speech for
tomorrow’s park dedication.

214
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:39,495
I’ll be happy to drive you.

215
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:45,495
No need. Mayor Manx is waiting
for me outside. One  of the, um,
“perks” of being Deputy Mayor.

216
00:31:45,995 --> 00:31:47,055
Thanks, Chance.

217
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:54,526
- Did you hear that? She’s crazy
about me! - Bye, Jake!

218
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:10,893
So, this is the secret lab
of the legendary Dr. Viper.

219
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:14,185
Quite an eyeful, isn’t it, Morbulus?

220
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:20,060
Very impressive. Looks like you’ve got
everything a mad scientist needs, right here.

221
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:27,175
Everything except the rare biochemical
compound known as Katalyst 99.

222
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:29,921
Well maybe I could help
ya get it, doc.

223
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:34,497
We see eye to eye, Morbulus.

224
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:40,395
I do have need of  someone to get
me into Megakat Biochemical Labs!

225
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:45,120
Megakat Labs? Are you outta your mind?!
That building’s impenetrable!

226
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,623
Up until now.

227
00:32:51,425 --> 00:32:54,457
What? What have you done to me?!

228
00:32:56,964 --> 00:33:03,965
I’m letting you help me! As a living
test tube for my new bacteria strain!

229
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:07,371
- No!
- Yes!

230
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:17,425
I have big plans for you!  With your help, I will
have Katalyst 99, and the power to destroy
Megakat City!

231
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:35,418
I’m not sure using these turbo plugs on
Callie’s engine is such a good idea, Chance.

232
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:39,083
I say she’s gotta have extra horsepower
in case of an emergency.

233
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,386
I say you’re gonna blow the engine.

234
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:46,833
Jake, I’m a pilot. I know what
an engine can handle.

235
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:53,707
See? Purrs like a kitten.
Growls like a tiger!

236
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:59,584
Blows like a volcano!
Now what’ll we tell Callie?

237
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,740
I’ll think of somethin’.

238
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:07,254
Problems, guys?
Maybe we can add to ‘em!

239
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,957
Hit it, Murray!

240
00:34:14,395 --> 00:34:16,760
This makes my day, Burke!

241
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,085
They come a long way from bein’ pilots.

242
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:23,771
A looooong way – down!

243
00:34:27,728 --> 00:34:29,326
Sign here.

244
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:39,524
Here’s your copy! We’ll tell Commander
Feral, you sent your love!

245
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,088
Adios, amigos!

246
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:46,930
“This makes my day!”.

247
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:52,930
If those dipsticks knew we built
the Turbokat outta stuff like this.

248
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:55,856
They’d cough up a hairball!

249
00:34:57,169 --> 00:35:04,428
Check it out. We can drop this baby under
Callie’s hood. With a little modification, of course.

250
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:07,365
And I think I found our new TV!

251
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:25,077
What’s goin’ on out here?

252
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:32,640
Get away!

253
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:36,273
I’ll teach you to tamper with my
experiment!

254
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:45,555
And now that you’ve had your breakfast, it’s time
to begin our commute into Megakat City, by sewer.

255
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:51,011
Follow me!

256
00:35:56,177 --> 00:36:02,022
As Mayor of Megakat City, I am proud to dedicate
this beautiful new park, which bears my name.

257
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:09,460
That Callie sure is pretty.

258
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:12,989
Yeah, but she’ll be pretty mad if
we don’t get her car running.

259
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:18,384
From the new Manx Municipal Park,
this is Ann Gora for Kat’s Eye News.

260
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,114
What in the…!? Quick, get a shot of that!

261
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:28,522
It’s every kat for himself!

262
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:40,692
- Better let me drive, Mayor!
- Just get me out of here!

263
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:51,489
- Hey, that’s Callie!
- Out of my way, slimeball!

264
00:37:07,263 --> 00:37:08,211
Let’s hit it!

265
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:33,025
Come on, Mayor! Hurry!

266
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:54,617
- Relax, Mayor. The Enforcers
are here, now! - So are the SWAT Kats!

267
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,402
- Looks like Callie’s safe.
- Not the way Feral flies!

268
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:06,009
Back off, you vigilantes! The authorities
are handling this! Fire on my order!

269
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,150
I don’t think that’s a good idea, Feral.
We saw what happened when Callie hit it.

270
00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:12,429
- He’s right!
- I’m in command here!

271
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:16,826
I think he’s blown us off.

272
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:22,058
Fire!

273
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:28,431
Now he’s done it!

274
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:39,767
Those fools have given me three
ways into Megakat Labs!

275
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:54,016
- Normal weapons won’t stop them!
- You’ve made that abundantly clear, Feral.

276
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:58,650
They seem to be heading for the Biochemical
Labs. We’d better get there first!

277
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:03,963
- Any idea what to throw at these guys?
- How ’bout Feral?

278
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:09,558
- Thanks to him we’ve got three to fight!
- Then how come I only see two!?

279
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,259
- Hey, where’d the other one go?
- Use the X-ray Beam!

280
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:27,494
- Oh no, one’s going in the subway!
- Gotta move fast!

281
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:54,340
Oh no, too late!

282
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:18,092
So, it doesn’t like heat? Maybe it’ll
follow me onto this electrified rail and die!

283
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,270
Bingo!

284
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:33,187
- Razor, what is cookin’ down there?
- Fried bacteria! Rendezvous in 5 seconds.

285
00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:37,392
3, 2, 1... Gotcha!

286
00:40:39,686 --> 00:40:44,688
- The other two  giant zits are closin’
in on Megakat Labs! - I can handle ‘em.

287
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:51,802
They appear to be giant bacteria.
On such short notice, this is the best I could do.

288
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:57,437
It contains the most powerful antibiotics
known. Hopefully, it should stop them.

289
00:40:58,144 --> 00:41:05,031
- It better work. There heading right for us!
- Don’t worry! These windows are practically
indestructible.

290
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:21,530
While the bacteria wreak havoc, I
will raid the labs!

291
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:30,469
I’m coming too! I don’t want to be
around here if this stuff doesn’t work!

292
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:36,457
- You’re a coward, Manx.
- You don’t get to be Mayor for ten terms,
without being cautious!

293
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:50,562
- Say ‘A’!
- One Megavolt Missile, away!

294
00:41:56,831 --> 00:42:04,980
- I thought you said this would work!
- Give it time. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

295
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:15,917
- The SWAT Kats took care of that one, Feral.
- And I’ll take care of the other!

296
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,319
Got him!

297
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:30,695
It worked!

298
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:39,100
You were always an arrogant fool,
Dr. Zyme! My bacteria is immune to antibiotics!

299
00:42:50,808 --> 00:42:55,965
- Time for another Megavolt Missile!
- Guess I’m one short!

300
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:05,215
- You won’t get away with this, Dr. Viper!
-  No, Miss Briggs. It’s you who won’t get away!

301
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:10,029
- Callie!
- Callie!

302
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:19,183
Lead him onto the bridge, then
double back! Now!

303
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:45,486
Game’s over, Dr. Viper!

304
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,309
Still one more play!

305
00:44:05,902 --> 00:44:10,238
- Miss Briggs, are you all right?
- Yes, thanks to the SWAT Kats.

306
00:44:10,968 --> 00:44:12,121
Whoever they are.

307
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:15,873
Thanks to them, half of Megakat City
is without power!

308
00:44:17,248 --> 00:44:19,530
Hey, you know a better way to cook
a giant bacteria?

309
00:44:28,778 --> 00:44:32,719
Looks like Burke and Murray have
got a looooong day ahead of ‘em.

310
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Episode 3
THE WRATH OF DARK KAT

311
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,761
Halt or we’ll shoot!

312
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:02,775
Citizens of Megakat City, this is Dark Kat.
My business at this facility will be brief.

313
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,449
I warn you, do not interfere!

314
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:23,339
I repeat, do not interfere! You have witnessed
only a sample of my destructive power!

315
00:47:23,826 --> 00:47:29,627
Any more acts of defiance, and Megakat
City will suffer on a grand scale.

316
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:52,354
Stop! This is a secured area!
Put me down!

317
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,793
They’ve breached the reactor!
Everybody get out! Get out!

318
00:48:13,262 --> 00:48:17,996
As usual, Kat’s Eye News is first on the
scene of this late-breaking story at
Megakat Nuclear Plant.

319
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:22,295
And it appears Deputy Mayor Callie
Briggs has just arrived.

320
00:48:23,224 --> 00:48:30,013
Everybody stand back! This area is under
Enforcer control! That means you, too, lady!

321
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,326
Back off, Steele. Let Deputy Mayor
Briggs through.

322
00:48:35,138 --> 00:48:39,856
You must forgive Lieutenant Steele,
Miss Briggs. He’s green and a little too ambitious.

323
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:43,752
- What’s the situation here, Commander?
- Dark Kat has broken into the reactor.

324
00:48:44,536 --> 00:48:48,545
We’re just about to move in, if you’d
like to stay and watch the fireworks.

325
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,904
Fireworks? Commander, you can’t
fire this close to the reactor!

326
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:57,099
One mistake and the whole city
could be poisoned by radioactivity!

327
00:48:57,831 --> 00:49:04,669
And what do you suggest I do, Miss Briggs?
Wait for Dark Kat to steal all the nuclear matierial inside?

328
00:49:05,297 --> 00:49:08,233
Feral to all units!
Move in now!

329
00:49:20,894 --> 00:49:26,014
Blast that  Dark Kat! Very well.
Let’s see what he can do against this!

330
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:31,482
Dark Kat will never be able to hit three
targets traveling faster than the speed of sound!

331
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:43,233
Kats alive! Those
were the best pilots I had…

332
00:49:43,654 --> 00:49:46,472
I know two better ones.

333
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:07,640
- Pepper number one.
- Well, I’ll see that, and raise you this.

334
00:50:24,173 --> 00:50:25,172
It’s Callie.

335
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,797
He’s broken into the Megakat Nuclear
Plant, and the Enforcers are helpless to stop him.

336
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:43,607
Got it, Miss Briggs, we’re on our way!

337
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:52,014
Razor, tell the truth. Did you really
eat that last mongo pepper?

338
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:57,309
T-Bone, I can’t believe you’d even
ask me that. I can still feel the afterburn.

339
00:50:58,419 --> 00:51:03,844
- No doubt about it, Razor. You are one
macho kat. - Ain’t it the truth?

340
00:51:12,725 --> 00:51:17,358
- The SWAT Kats! What are they doing here?
- Your job, Feral.

341
00:51:18,872 --> 00:51:22,328
So, Dark Kat’s back. Well
he won’t get away from us this time!

342
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:26,891
Good morning, Dark Kat, this
is your wakeup call!

343
00:51:28,372 --> 00:51:30,950
Razor, those Baby Boomer
Missiles didn’t make a dent!

344
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,955
There must be some kind of
a forcefield surrounding the ship.

345
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,785
Since explosives don’t work, this could be the
perfect time to try out my new Scrambler Missile.

346
00:51:40,218 --> 00:51:44,796
Good idea. If one million megavolts
can’t take out those shields, nothing will.

347
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,453
- Don’t wimp out on me now, Al! Get in closer!
- It’s too dangerous, Annie!

348
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:55,984
For Kat’s Eye News? Come on! I wanna
see Dark Kat’s expression when
the SWAT Kats whip his tail!

349
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:03,891
Great kats! We’ve lost our man
rotar! We’re goin’ down!

350
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,019
- We’re hit!
- Where’s that Scrambler Missile?

351
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:25,318
Jammed. That heat blast messed us
up good. We’re sittin’ ducks!

352
00:52:25,718 --> 00:52:27,257
No, we’re outta here!

353
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:36,235
- Look, Commander. The SWAT Kats have failed.
- Shut up, you idiot. This is no time to gloat.

354
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:38,234
Sorry, Commander, I just thought...

355
00:52:38,546 --> 00:52:43,567
Don’t think, listen. The only way to
stop Dark Kat is from inside that ship.

356
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:50,082
I’m going to try to sneak in. I’ll take along
a signal device, so you and the
Enforcers can follow me.

357
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:55,047
- Yes sir. It’s an inspired plan, sir.
- No, it’s desperate and it’s stupid!

358
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:02,876
Captain! I want you to throw everything
you’ve got at Dark Kat on my order!

359
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:04,500
Yes sir!

360
00:53:04,758 --> 00:53:09,134
- If I don’t come back, you’re in command.
- I’m hardly worthy, Commander.

361
00:53:09,414 --> 00:53:10,931
You can say that again.

362
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,602
Fire!

363
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:39,432
Where’s Feral?

364
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:45,404
He left, and I’m in charge.
Lt. Cmd. Steele, that’s with two Es.

365
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:50,946
Steele, I’m on Dark Kat’s ship.
Set up tracers while try to stop him.

366
00:53:51,346 --> 00:53:53,994
Yes sir. Good luck, sir,
and break a leg.

367
00:53:54,481 --> 00:54:00,002
- That Dark Kat’s never brought us
anything but bad luck.
- He almost hit our fuel tanks.

368
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:07,243
We’re here, Miss Briggs,
repairing the Turbokat.

369
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:13,026
Well you’d better hurry. Dark Kat
escaped with some nuclear fuel rods,
and Feral sneaked aboard to stop him!

370
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:14,544
Feral?!

371
00:54:16,448 --> 00:54:19,251
Steele, this is Feral.
Are you following my signal?

372
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:25,277
I’m sorry, sir, but we haven’t had a
chance to scramble any jets yet.
Mechanical problems.

373
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:30,667
- Steele, where’s my backup?
- Be patient, sir. We’ll be there as
soon as possible.

374
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:34,533
But not too soon.

375
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:42,013
He hung up on me!
The little creep hung up on me!

376
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:06,763
It’s about time you said hello, Cmd. I
imagine it was getting rather chilly in
the cargo bay.

377
00:55:07,248 --> 00:55:10,810
You’re too late, Dark Kat!
The Enforcers are right behind me!

378
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:22,888
You’re referring to the signal this
communicator is sending. When your men
will arrive, Megakat City will be in ruins!

379
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:29,825
Welcome aboard the Doomsday
Express, Commander! Enjoy the ride!

380
00:55:36,043 --> 00:55:40,324
This is all too weird, Chance.
I mean Dark Kat, Feral, it’s like deja vu.

381
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,794
Deja who? What do you mean?

382
00:55:43,235 --> 00:55:47,888
I mean not only are we going after Dark Kat,
but we also have to save Feral’s tail.

383
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:52,922
- Do you remember what he did to us that day?
- Remember? How could I ever forget.

384
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:58,951
- Chance, Jake, let him go it’s too
dangerous! - Negative. We’re bringing
Dark Kat in.

385
00:55:59,411 --> 00:56:01,532
You guys get yourselves some
donuts.

386
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:13,516
- You two are nuts! We’re
breakin’ off pursuit! - We’ll bring
this psycho in if it kills us.

387
00:56:17,598 --> 00:56:22,609
Now I’ll destroy the justice
machine that protects Megakat City!

388
00:56:23,185 --> 00:56:28,063
- He’s locking missiles on the new
Enforcer building! - Then we gotta
nail him now, Jake!

389
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:31,266
No problemo! Missile deployed!

390
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:37,326
- No! My missiles won’t fire!
- Knocked out his weapons system!

391
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:40,202
One more shot and Dark Kat is
history!

392
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:44,533
This is Feral. Fall back, you two.
I’ll handle Dark Kat.

393
00:56:44,876 --> 00:56:48,782
Negative, Commander Feral, we already
have our missiles locked! It’s our tag!

394
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:54,158
- I’m ordering you to back off!
- I repeat, sir, we’ve got a lock!

395
00:56:57,924 --> 00:57:00,299
We’re outta the game, Chance.
We gotta eject!

396
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:15,052
Dark Kat’s gone! All because of
those two young hotshots!

397
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:19,702
- Heck of a loss, Jake.
- Monumental disaster, Chance.

398
00:57:20,176 --> 00:57:25,863
I’m glad you both agree. Because this is
the last act of vandalism you will ever
perform on this city.

399
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:31,953
It was our tag, Commander! None
of this would have happened if you
hadn’t interferred, sir!

400
00:57:32,174 --> 00:57:37,361
- That’s it! You’re off the force!
Both of you! - Suits us.

401
00:57:38,391 --> 00:57:40,219
Who needs this crud anyway?

402
00:57:41,284 --> 00:57:45,893
Just a minute. I said you’re off
the force, but not off the hook.

403
00:57:46,314 --> 00:57:52,454
There’s still the matter of paying for this building, and
that’s what you two are going to be doing for a long,
long time.

404
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:03,267
Hey look, Burke. it’s those two hotshots
who wrecked the new Enforcer building.

405
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:07,415
Don’t look so hot, now, do they?

406
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:19,240
Hey, Feral says you guys gotta run the
salvage yard, ’till you pay back every penny it
costs to rebuild the Enforcer building.

407
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:25,446
Yeah, and at your present salary,
it’ll only take a thousand years!

408
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:31,502
- Take care of the place now, boys!
- We’ll be checkin’ up on ya!

409
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:36,676
This can’t be happening!
We’re pilots, not junkmen!

410
00:58:37,227 --> 00:58:41,979
Hey, y’know Chance, there’s enough
military salvage here to build our own jet.

411
00:58:42,321 --> 00:58:43,550
And do what?

412
00:58:43,768 --> 00:58:50,145
Get back in the air and get back at
Dark Kat! And all the other criminal scum who
rear their ugly heads in Megakat City.

413
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:53,019
Only this time, we do it our way!

414
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,878
Well, whata re we waitin’ for,
buddy?

415
00:58:57,526 --> 00:59:01,986
Time to take care of Dark Kat!
And this time, we do it our way!

416
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:23,965
My Doomsday Device is nearly complete,
Cmd. The nuclear fuel rods I just stole
are the last components I require.

417
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:36,530
In less than on hour, I will destroy Megakat
City! And from its ashes I will create a new
city, where lawlessness is the law of the land!

418
00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:43,904
- Feral’s signal is coming from inside
that volcano. - Inside? You sure?

419
00:59:44,341 --> 00:59:48,779
No doubt about it. Swing around.
Maybe the X-Ray Beam will show
us a way in.

420
00:59:50,718 --> 00:59:53,936
The volcano’s honeycombed with
passages, but no real entrance.

421
00:59:54,427 --> 01:00:00,029
- Guess we’ll just have to make
our own door? - Affirmative. Realeasing
Mole Missile, now!

422
01:00:09,403 --> 01:00:11,001
Bingo! We’re in!

423
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,750
Time to settle up with Dark Kat.

424
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:36,531
Careful, my creeplings. We don’t want any
accidents. The SWAT Kats? You didn’t
mention they were joining the party, cmd.

425
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:46,156
The signals’ coming in strong.
Dark Kat should be dead ahead!

426
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:12,049
Watch this, Commander. The SWAT Kats
are about to discover that tunnel offers
no escape!

427
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:16,564
- T-Bone! - I know! What do you
want me to do, stop?!

428
01:01:20,939 --> 01:01:28,117
So much for the SWAT Kats. Now,
where was I? Oh yes. Doomsday!

429
01:01:31,959 --> 01:01:36,328
- The Glovatrix. Don’t leave base without it.
- Roger that.

430
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,939
Now sit there and be quiet.
This won’t take much longer.

431
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:56,178
Heads up, Dark Crud!

432
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,799
Too late! My bomb is armed!

433
01:02:21,253 --> 01:02:22,629
Game’s over!

434
01:02:31,432 --> 01:02:31,818
T-Bone!

435
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:38,721
Nevermind me! Load the bomb!

436
01:02:41,379 --> 01:02:42,347
T-Bone!

437
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:45,408
Hey, what too ya so long?

438
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:49,901
Dark Kat is getting away!

439
01:02:57,831 --> 01:03:00,495
- We have to stop him!
- What do you mean, we?

440
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,190
Looks like you won’t be
needing a ride, Feral.

441
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:20,068
- Commander Feral, you’re okay?
- Lights against you all the way, Steele?

442
01:03:20,556 --> 01:03:22,724
Sorry, sir, we had trouble
getting organized...

443
01:03:23,129 --> 01:03:27,145
Mister, you don’t know what trouble is.
But I’m going to introduce you to some!

444
01:03:27,723 --> 01:03:31,393
Bit sir- I’m not really trained for this.

445
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:34,912
You want my job, greenhorn?
This is how you learn it.

446
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,257
Today will become the blackest
day in Megakat City’s history.

447
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:55,723
- We’re too late! He’s ready to unload!
- It’s not over ’till the fat kat sings!

448
01:04:02,497 --> 01:04:06,401
And now, it’s doomsday time.

449
01:04:08,369 --> 01:04:14,757
Why won’t the bomb release?! It’s one
of those meddling SWAT Kats!

450
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:26,881
Your luck just ran out!

451
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:30,372
Holy kats!

452
01:04:33,914 --> 01:04:37,271
Megakat City is history,
my creeplings!

453
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:42,036
Razor, jump! I’ll blast the bomb
as soon as you’re free!

454
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:46,646
No can do, T-Bone. It’ll explode for
sure and destroy the city.

455
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:51,884
I’ve gotta try to disarm this baby
right now, or we’re all goners anyway.

456
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:53,787
Any lasts requests, buddy?

457
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:57,009
Yeah. Get Dark Kat!

458
01:05:00,914 --> 01:05:05,883
Just remember, always cut the red wire.
Aw, Dark Kat, you miserable psycho!

459
01:05:09,154 --> 01:05:11,916
Will I never be rid of those
infernal SWAT Kats?

460
01:05:14,155 --> 01:05:17,601
Switching to auxillary weapons
panel. This is for you, Razor.

461
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:22,886
Dark Kat, I am takin’ you down!

462
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:33,226
No! My shields have
shortcircuited!

463
01:05:33,945 --> 01:05:39,059
- Say goodnight, Dark Kat!
- Back off, SWAT Kat! The
Enforcers will handle this!

464
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:41,555
You back off, Feral! It’s my tag!

465
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:48,968
- Steele, return fire!
- I, I don’t have any experience in this, sir.

466
01:05:49,405 --> 01:05:52,596
I’ve never been in an actual air fight!
I think I’m gonna be sick!

467
01:05:53,886 --> 01:05:55,874
You wanted my job?

468
01:05:58,259 --> 01:06:01,167
This has gotta be the right wire.
Well, I’ll soon find out.

469
01:06:12,158 --> 01:06:15,634
Out of the way, SWAT Kat! I’
m taking Dark Kat personally!

470
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:20,059
But he’s not
crowdin’ me out this time!

471
01:06:24,337 --> 01:06:25,639
This one’s for you, Razor!

472
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:33,542
Too bad Razor wasn’t
here to see it.

473
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:38,699
- T-Bone, how’s it going up there?
- Razor! Mission accomplished.

474
01:06:39,307 --> 01:06:42,264
And I guess you must’ve stopped
the bomb from wreckin’ the city.

475
01:06:42,783 --> 01:06:48,854
Basically, yeah, but, you better pick me up
at Enforcer Headquarters, before Feral
comes back and sticks us with another bill.

476
01:06:49,229 --> 01:06:50,667
On my way.

477
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:40,440
Episode 4
DESTRUCTIVE NATURE

478
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:50,667
At 300 stories, Megakat Tower is the tallest,
most modern office complex in the whole city!

479
01:08:52,377 --> 01:08:53,478
Very impressive.

480
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:58,899
Oh yes! Why, it’s the perfect place to house
your corporate headquarters, Mr. Young!

481
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:01,725
Perhaps.

482
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:06,461
- How’m I doing?
- Greed brings out the best in you, Mr. Mayor.

483
01:09:07,145 --> 01:09:08,057
Thank you.

484
01:09:08,521 --> 01:09:12,258
He sunk most of the city treasury into
this place, but that’s off the record.

485
01:09:12,677 --> 01:09:15,636
Gotcha, and thanks again for
giving me the exclusive, Callie.

486
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:22,586
Now, why don’t we continue this meeting at
Megakat Golf Course? We tee off in ten minutes!

487
01:09:23,043 --> 01:09:27,115
So close to the golf course?
This is an excellent location!

488
01:09:27,493 --> 01:09:31,294
That’s what I’ve been tryin’ to tell you!
Right This way, gentlemen!

489
01:09:33,685 --> 01:09:40,259
Not this time, sucker! You’re dead meat!
Ha! Gotcha! Uh oh, sneak attack!

490
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:53,650
Got ‘em! Two million points and
I’ve saved the universe!

491
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,615
Well I’m tryin’ to save this place
from the smell of sour milk.

492
01:09:58,602 --> 01:10:03,884
- So that’s what all this plant business is about.
- Good for the environment, good for the air.

493
01:10:05,742 --> 01:10:13,040
But not so good for my game score.
And I was goin’ for a personal best, too!

494
01:10:14,245 --> 01:10:20,010
Relax, buddy. Space Kat!
There's always another universe to save.

495
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:48,274
Today, only a few potted plants occupy the
Megakat Tower, but when it opens next month
this place is guaranteed to be a bustling
business center!

496
01:10:48,826 --> 01:10:50,964
This is Ann Gora, Kat's Eye News.

497
01:10:56,186 --> 01:11:01,893
And this is Callie Briggs, klutz. No, it
couldn't be!

498
01:11:08,301 --> 01:11:10,148
Get some good shots of the courtyard.

499
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:24,228
What the?!

500
01:11:44,948 --> 01:11:51,820
Thanks to my growth formula, this
building is now impenetrable!

501
01:11:52,540 --> 01:12:02,570
But I count on you, my creations,
to protect me from Feral, his Enforcers,
and most of all, those meddling SWAT Kats!

502
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:07,384
It is Dr. Viper!

503
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:24,243
Soon, this foul city will be one giant,
glorious swamp!

504
01:12:24,792 --> 01:12:26,822
- I’d better get some help!
- A spy!

505
01:12:32,446 --> 01:12:33,859
No way out!

506
01:12:38,168 --> 01:12:38,934
Not connected yet!

507
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:50,597
- Yes, Miss Briggs?
- We’ve got problems! It's Viper!

508
01:12:51,723 --> 01:12:56,199
- Viper?! Where?
- At Megakat Towers! And this time he’s got
an army of plant monsters to...

509
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:05,360
Misd Briggs! Let’s kick some
Viper tail!

510
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:25,518
Report!

511
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,520
According to witnesses, Commander,
this stuff just sprang up in minutes!

512
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:31,541
But it’s gonna take
a week to cut through.

513
01:13:32,081 --> 01:13:33,517
Not if we burn our way in!

514
01:13:34,412 --> 01:13:39,627
That’s a ten story wall of dry brush, sir!
If our fire gets outta hand it’ll torch the whole city!

515
01:13:40,177 --> 01:13:41,425
Objection noted.

516
01:13:42,612 --> 01:13:47,958
Ann Gora, Kat’s Eye News! Commander
Feral, are you aware that Deputy Mayor
Briggs is trapped somewhere in that tower?

517
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:54,230
Briggs? That figures. Get the choppers
ready, we’ll take the tower from above!

518
01:14:05,721 --> 01:14:11,190
Kats alive! This stuff’s acid, eating
right through my chopper!

519
01:14:15,132 --> 01:14:22,557
Weapon systems gummed up! Viper...?
Should’ve known that crazy lizard would
be behind this mess!

520
01:14:23,737 --> 01:14:29,116
Run, Feral, you fool. Because there’s
nothing you can do to stop me!

521
01:14:32,645 --> 01:14:36,083
- Let me go!
- Save your breath, Miss Briggs!

522
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:46,365
My plantimals obey only me. Besides,
you don’t want to run away and miss out on
all the excitement!

523
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:50,586
What is that thing?

524
01:14:51,522 --> 01:15:00,270
My spore pod? Why it’s going to explode!
And at this height, it’s beautiful spores will
cover the entire city!

525
01:15:02,584 --> 01:15:14,293
I can see it all now. A spectacular new
Megakat City. No more ugly metal and plastic,
only beautiful swamp...

526
01:15:14,993 --> 01:15:23,648
ruled by me! Dr. Viper’s Megaswamp
City! It will be so beautiful!

527
01:15:24,445 --> 01:15:28,022
Wake up and smell the coffee,
Viper! Here come the SWAT Kats!

528
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:34,458
- Looks like a farmer’s market down there!
- It’s Viper alright, and he’s got Callie!

529
01:15:35,241 --> 01:15:36,991
Attack them, my little pets!

530
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:44,336
- We’ve got some plug-ugly company!
- Ok, T-Bone. Weapon systems ready.

531
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:50,242
- Hey these things are spittin’ acid!
- So I’ve noticed! I’m takin’ evasive action!

532
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,045
Piranha Missiles, away!

533
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:08,963
- T-Bone, those things melted my
missiles! - Attack! Destroy them!

534
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:20,900
You see, Miss Briggs, my armies are
endless! She’s gone! You fool, you let her escape!

535
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:35,432
- Say again, Razor? You must be jokin’!
- I said, I’ll penetrate the building, and...

536
01:16:35,715 --> 01:16:40,242
- ...come up on Viper from underneath!
- That’s a negative, Razor. Plants are
takin’ over the whole building.

537
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,797
- Affirmative, but Callie’s in there, T-Bone!
- Right.

538
01:16:46,713 --> 01:16:51,515
- Maintain radio contact at all times, do you copy?
- Affirmative, T-Bone. I’m goin’ in!

539
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:02,401
- Razor, you okay? Talk to me, buddy!
- Looks like a swamp in here, but so far so good.

540
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:08,649
- What’s your situation?
- It’s weird. Those flying cabbages don’t
attack me unless I’m close to the roof.

541
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:12,057
Just keep away from ‘em. I’ll call ya
when I find Callie.

542
01:17:17,423 --> 01:17:18,462
Don’t like the look of this.

543
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,172
Chew on this!

544
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:34,591
I don’t believe it!

545
01:17:44,152 --> 01:17:46,863
- Any progress, Razor?
- No sign of Callie.

546
01:17:49,275 --> 01:17:50,707
Gotta run! Out!

547
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:59,891
Cmd. Feral, do you have a plan for
getting Deputy Mayor Briggs out of there?

548
01:18:00,434 --> 01:18:03,685
Yes, a simple one. We’re going in!

549
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,463
Fire!

550
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:15,091
- That did it, Commander! We’re through!
- Let’s move in!

551
01:18:18,904 --> 01:18:21,594
- Blast it!
- Looks like Feral got stopped at the door.

552
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:30,841
What?!

553
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:37,113
Excuse my clumsiness!
You play through, I have to a phone call.

554
01:18:39,968 --> 01:18:40,966
Get me Feral!

555
01:18:43,527 --> 01:18:55,826
Soon, my lovely, soon! Let those fools
waste their time. In fifteen minutes,
Megakat City will be mine!

556
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:16,624
he toughest tanks we have, and that,
that thing melted ‘em like butter!

557
01:19:17,108 --> 01:19:23,406
Now you listen to me, Mayor, Dr. Viper has
turned your pet skyscraper into a living
weed patch, and...

558
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:29,081
No, you listen to me, Feral! The city has
a billion dollars sunk in that tower.

559
01:19:29,595 --> 01:19:34,377
Use weed killer if you have to, but
get that wacko Viper out of there now!

560
01:19:35,015 --> 01:19:37,334
- And don’t damage the building
doing it! - You don’t understand...

561
01:19:37,614 --> 01:19:42,234
Don’t do it, Feral! My friends here are
about to sign a ten year lease!

562
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:48,778
- Is there a problem, Mayor Manx?
- Don’t be ridiculous, not at all.

563
01:19:50,686 --> 01:19:57,772
Great! I can’t burn, cut or blast!
What does he expect me to do?
Leave it to the SWAT Kats?!

564
01:20:27,085 --> 01:20:28,593
What’s it take to stop these things!?

565
01:20:31,564 --> 01:20:38,551
- That should buy me some time.
- Oh no. Wake up! Oh, Razor I’m so sorry!

566
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:45,642
- Callie? Uh, Miss Briggs?
- Are you okay? I hit you pretty hard.

567
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,806
- Good thing we’re required to wear
helmets. - I thought you were one of them.

568
01:20:56,688 --> 01:20:57,805
This way, hurry!

569
01:21:07,315 --> 01:21:08,766
Make room, Miss Briggs!

570
01:21:15,732 --> 01:21:20,995
- Copter 1 is on approach from the chemical
factory. - We’ll try it the Mayor’s way.

571
01:21:21,682 --> 01:21:25,305
Let’s see how that cabbage
likes a thousand gallons of weed killer!

572
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:30,514
Drop payload on my command!

573
01:21:34,486 --> 01:21:36,174
Roger! We have target aquisisioned!

574
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:40,134
Now!

575
01:21:44,996 --> 01:21:47,746
Gotcha! We’re goin’ in!

576
01:21:51,744 --> 01:21:54,201
Oh no! Commander, weed killer
only makes it bigger!

577
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,932
Is there no way to destroy
these things!?

578
01:22:00,744 --> 01:22:03,775
Feral’s strikin’ out big time down there.
Razor, what’s your status?

579
01:22:05,121 --> 01:22:08,355
I’ve got Miss Briggs. We’re in the
ventilation shaft heading for the roof.

580
01:22:09,182 --> 01:22:10,215
The roof?! That’s a negative!

581
01:22:17,643 --> 01:22:19,986
Those critters won’t let me get
close enough for pickup!

582
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:24,540
- No time for that. Miss Briggs says Viper’s...
- He’s growing a pod to destroy the city!

583
01:22:25,434 --> 01:22:28,736
- We’re gonna have tos top him from inside.
- Well ya don’t have much time.

584
01:22:29,454 --> 01:22:34,588
- From what I can see, that ugly thing is about
ready to burst! - We’re on our way, big buddy!

585
01:22:36,172 --> 01:22:38,530
Am I just scared or is it freezing
in here?

586
01:22:50,213 --> 01:22:54,183
- Now, Razor! Blast ‘em!
-  With what!? I’ve got nothing left but
grappling hooks!

587
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:02,434
- It worked!
- Yeah, but the cold stopped ‘em first.

588
01:23:03,186 --> 01:23:07,489
- Too bad we couldn’t freeze the whole building.
- Hey, maybe we can! Come on!

589
01:23:08,395 --> 01:23:13,715
T-Bone, I think we found a way to stop Viper.
But you’re gonna have to make a fast pickup
at the space center.

590
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:19,996
- I’m there, buddy. What do you need?
- Super rocket coolant! We’ll meet you on
the roof in 10 minutes.

591
01:23:21,552 --> 01:23:23,590
How can you be so sure we’ll
make it in ten minutes?

592
01:23:24,092 --> 01:23:25,656
‘Cause we’re gonna take a shortcut!

593
01:23:31,592 --> 01:23:34,581
- You call this a shortcut?
- Hang on tight!

594
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:40,246
- I don’t know about thi-aaaaah!
- This is easy.

595
01:23:41,303 --> 01:23:42,843
Yeah, piece of cake.

596
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:51,989
Turbokat, I say again, this is flight control,
you are not cleared for this area. Over.

597
01:23:52,435 --> 01:23:55,544
Understood, flight control. But I have
an emergency situation here.

598
01:23:56,027 --> 01:23:59,255
- Explain the nature of your
emergency. Over. - Here’s the deal…

599
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:06,880
- What’s that SWAT Kat want
with a tank of super rocket coolant?
- Who cares?

600
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,510
Yeah, but that one barrel has enough
coolant to freeze a whole city block!

601
01:24:17,001 --> 01:24:18,696
Razor, we’ve got trouble!

602
01:24:21,323 --> 01:24:22,197
Big trouble!

603
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:36,699
It’s just you and me now, sweetness.
Feral is helpless, and the SWAT Kats
have run away in their stupid jet!

604
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:45,479
You’re so beautiful!  It’s going to be
a shame to have you explode!

605
01:24:57,918 --> 01:24:59,418
If anything’s happened to him, I’ll….

606
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:09,977
- Nice knowing you, Razor!
- Thanks, and it still will be.

607
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:16,166
I’ve been
saving this for last! Hang on!

608
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,784
Attack! Protect our spore pod!

609
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:36,543
Time for some real flyin’!
I owe it that much to Razor.

610
01:25:39,327 --> 01:25:45,420
Eat my backwash, you lettuceheads!
Barbecued cabbage, my favorite!

611
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:51,473
They’re tougher than I thought!

612
01:25:53,389 --> 01:25:56,138
- Don’t tell me your givin’ up!
- Razor!

613
01:25:56,876 --> 01:26:02,001
The SWAT Kats have failed!
In a few minutes, it will be all over!

614
01:26:02,745 --> 01:26:07,844
- You can say that again, snake-puss!
- What!? it’s not possible!

615
01:26:08,482 --> 01:26:12,918
- Anything’s possible, ugly!
- You can’t stop me now!

616
01:26:22,007 --> 01:26:26,384
- It’s oblivion for you, SWAT Kat!
- Razor! No!

617
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:33,945
Yes! But don’t worry, Miss Briggs,
you’ll be joining him!

618
01:26:36,073 --> 01:26:37,385
Need a lift?

619
01:26:54,852 --> 01:27:01,109
- This is great! My weapons systems are
all gummed up! - Musta gotten too close
to those sap-slingers.

620
01:27:02,368 --> 01:27:08,154
Yeah. Well, I’m gonna have to drop our freeze
bomb by hand, if that flying produce
doesn’t drop us, first!

621
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:20,447
Get ready, Viper! TheSWAT Kats are
gonna put the big chill or your big plans!

622
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:26,165
T-Bone, go for that big air
conditioning unit on the roof!

623
01:27:29,322 --> 01:27:32,342
Right on target! It’s now or never!

624
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,566
Get clear! On the double!

625
01:28:19,314 --> 01:28:22,872
Next time, Dr. Viper better make his
plans frost-free.

626
01:28:23,323 --> 01:28:26,354
Better drop me off, guys. I think the
Mayor’s gonna need sedation.

627
01:28:28,013 --> 01:28:30,376
Thanks! It was fun, w ehave to
do it again sometime.

628
01:28:31,637 --> 01:28:34,826
- Yeah, right. Take care!
- See you later, Miss Briggs...

629
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,947
...we have to get back. Razor
has to water his plants.

630
01:28:38,473 --> 01:28:41,293
Oh, no. I think I’ve had enough
gardening for one day.

631
01:29:00,907 --> 01:29:05,408
Thank you for the golf game,
but I think we will pass on
your most generous offer.

632
01:29:07,235 --> 01:29:13,824
Now, now, now don’t be hasty!
A fresh coat of paint, I’ll upgrade
the carpetting!

633
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,143
We have some lovely parting gifts,
just don’t part! Free golf clubs!  Come back!

634
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:59,190
Episode 5
METALLIKATS

635
01:31:11,497 --> 01:31:14,186
Best katnip in Megakat City,
Katscratch.

636
01:31:14,905 --> 01:31:17,675
See? It’s the good stuff!

637
01:31:31,581 --> 01:31:34,155
Where did you learn to drive, the
demolition derby?

638
01:31:34,782 --> 01:31:38,185
- So I run a couple a’ stop signs.
- Yeah, and here they all are.

639
01:31:40,804 --> 01:31:42,992
Look, are we goin’ in, or we gonna
yammer?

640
01:31:49,251 --> 01:31:51,171
Who the-?

641
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,459
Sorry we’re late, boys. Unavoidable
delays.

642
01:31:57,218 --> 01:31:58,796
Mac? Molly? Is that you?

643
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:05,162
- Mac, they remember us.
- They oughta! We used to run this mob!

644
01:32:06,157 --> 01:32:09,124
We heard youse drowned, tryin’
to bust outta Alkatraz.

645
01:32:10,093 --> 01:32:13,015
Yeah, and what’s with them voices?
How come you guys sound so weird?

646
01:32:18,624 --> 01:32:25,251
- It’s not just our voices that’ve changed.
- We had a complete makeover.

647
01:32:26,097 --> 01:32:29,281
- Whaddaya think?
- I think youse two should’ve stayed dead!

648
01:32:30,032 --> 01:32:34,656
It’s my mob now, and you
guys are history!

649
01:32:42,597 --> 01:32:45,021
What a shockin’ developement!

650
01:32:47,188 --> 01:32:54,035
The rest of you lugs listen up! The
Metallikats are runnin’ this city, now! And as
soon as we finish some personal business...

651
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:59,878
- Like rubbin’ out that crud Mayor Manx!
- We’re gonna tear up this town like a scratchin’ post!

652
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:02,100
- You’re the boss!
- Whatever ya say!

653
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,534
We’re with ya, guys!

654
01:33:04,307 --> 01:33:08,930
Thanks for your confidance, creeps!
But traitors like you don’t fit into our new plans.

655
01:33:09,742 --> 01:33:14,102
Molly and I are our own gang now,
and we’re dealin’ all of you out!

656
01:33:24,572 --> 01:33:25,870
So long, losers!

657
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:52,004
- Thermal sensor has detected an
explosion by the harbor. - Better take a look.

658
01:33:56,128 --> 01:34:00,598
- It’s the tuna factory. What a waste!
- Lowering the X-ray Scope.

659
01:34:05,435 --> 01:34:11,224
- What the heck was that?!
- Well, whatever it was, it’s goin’
over 200 miles an hour!

660
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:16,404
- No kiddin’. I’m goin’ after it!
- Negative, T-Bone. We’ve got other priorities.

661
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:21,522
The X-ray Scope reveals activity
inside that burning building. We’ve gotta
help them first!

662
01:34:26,098 --> 01:34:29,723
- Put us in hover mode, T-Bone. I’m gonna
try a foam bomb. - Roger that.

663
01:34:40,686 --> 01:34:43,618
Fire’s under control.
Goin’ in to help casualties.

664
01:34:45,932 --> 01:34:51,442
- Looks like the cavalry’s arrived.
- Which is our cue to split. They
can get inside faster than us.

665
01:35:03,474 --> 01:35:08,474
The SWAT Kats. I figured those
hoodlums had something to do with this.

666
01:35:11,586 --> 01:35:15,319
And you say the SWAT Kats are
responsible for this fire, Cmd. Feral?

667
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:25,750
Absolutely! Alot of you out there may
consider the SWAT Kats to be heroes, but I
think this wanton destruction proves what
criminals those two really are!

668
01:35:26,448 --> 01:35:34,585
- Mrs Briggs, do you have any comments on
this? - With all due respect to Cmd. Feral,
I don’t think he has a shred of evidence
to support his attack on the SWAT Kats.

669
01:35:38,511 --> 01:35:46,287
Fango! Up to your neck in trouble
again, I see. Talk to me, you creep. Did the
SWAT Kats do this?

670
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:52,353
It wasn’t the SWAT Kats.  It was
Mac and Molly Mange. They did it.

671
01:35:53,094 --> 01:35:56,416
You’re crazy! Mac and Molly have
been dead for months.

672
01:35:57,746 --> 01:36:04,689
No, they ain’t dead! They’re some
kinda robots now! Callin’ themselves
the Metallikats! They’re back from...

673
01:36:04,905 --> 01:36:09,875
...the dead to get revenge! And Mayor
Manx is next on their list!

674
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:15,603
- Mayor Manx? Why him?
- Didn’t the Mayor deny their parole,
Deputy Mayor?

675
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:21,368
That’s correct. If anyone deserved to spend
all their nine lives in jail, it’s those two.

676
01:36:23,508 --> 01:36:31,251
Then you better tell the Mayor to crawl into the
deepest hole he can find and stay there!
Bullets don’t stop the Metallikats! Nothin’
stops ‘em.

677
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:37,946
Take this trash out of here. Don’t
worry your little head, Briggs, the Enforcers
will handle this situation.

678
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:41,564
And if you can’t, I know two
heroes who can.

679
01:36:55,887 --> 01:36:56,855
Have you seen the paper?

680
01:37:00,074 --> 01:37:02,100
Hey! I’m tryin’ to watch Scaredy-Kat!
It’s an 80-hour marathon!

681
01:37:02,388 --> 01:37:07,261
It’s about that fire we put out. Paper
says it was caused by a couple of robots
called the Metallikats.

682
01:37:09,136 --> 01:37:13,826
Fine, let Feral handle it. Now, if you
don’t mind, I’m trying to watch Scaredy Kat.

683
01:37:14,526 --> 01:37:21,137
- Chance, it says here the Mayor’s in danger.
- Look, watch what happens when
Scaredy-Kat opens the closet again.

684
01:37:24,728 --> 01:37:26,103
Callie could be in danger, too.

685
01:37:29,963 --> 01:37:33,264
Hey, come on, you slouch! We’ve
got work to do!

686
01:37:38,251 --> 01:37:45,500
There’s too much at stake here.
Can’t afford to fail. Last ball, Manx.
This one’s for the game.

687
01:37:48,588 --> 01:37:50,510
Mayor! You’re in grave danger!

688
01:37:53,354 --> 01:37:55,253
<i>All units in the area,
please respond.</i>

689
01:37:55,721 --> 01:37:58,890
Got an interesting emergency call
comin’ in, T-Bone. Try the police band.

690
01:38:00,546 --> 01:38:04,814
<i>All available units, armored vehicle
out of control, main and central. Please
respond.</i>

691
01:38:05,464 --> 01:38:12,090
- Could be the Metallikats. Whaddaya
say, T-Bone? - I say let’s kick some robot tail!

692
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:29,450
- Make way for the Metallikat Express!
- Mac, you are absolutely the worst
driver in history!

693
01:38:30,011 --> 01:38:34,225
I don’t have to drive well in this little
hotrod. Everyone else jumps outta the way!

694
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:42,380
- Deploying Shark Missile, now!
- What’s goin’ on?!

695
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,857
- It’s the SWAT Kats!
- Those pests!

696
01:38:49,194 --> 01:38:53,169
I’ll teach ‘em a lesson.
The Relentless Missile!

697
01:38:56,819 --> 01:38:59,944
Hang onto your stomach!
We’re climbin’!

698
01:39:04,237 --> 01:39:06,438
Just glad I skipped lunch!

699
01:39:06,737 --> 01:39:10,624
You can forget about supper, too,
if we can’t shake this missile!

700
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,367
20 meters and closing!

701
01:39:25,721 --> 01:39:29,498
It’s a heat-seeker! It’s stayin’ right
on our engine exhaust!

702
01:39:39,719 --> 01:39:41,770
It’s like tryin’ to lose your own shadow!

703
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,795
Yeah, but this shadow’s carryin’ high
explosives!

704
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:58,189
Feral will hold them. I mean,
nobody’s better than Feral, right?

705
01:39:59,688 --> 01:40:01,770
Let’s hope so, Mayor, for our sakes.

706
01:40:07,688 --> 01:40:11,749
So sue me! How was I supposed to know
that was your sister’s car back there?!

707
01:40:12,304 --> 01:40:16,986
You always hated my side of the family!
Sometimes I don’t even know why I married you!

708
01:40:18,939 --> 01:40:19,998
Wait for the order, men.

709
01:40:20,959 --> 01:40:22,968
- Ready?
- Ready.

710
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:30,675
Mac and Molly Mange, you’re
under arrest! Surrender, or we’ll fire!

711
01:40:31,535 --> 01:40:34,556
- Knock yourself out, Commander!
- Fire!

712
01:41:03,535 --> 01:41:06,274
The Mayor’s on the tenth floor.
Take the inside route.

713
01:41:06,649 --> 01:41:09,870
- And what are you gonna do?
- I’m goin’ up this way!

714
01:41:16,627 --> 01:41:19,083
No, no! This can’t be happening!

715
01:41:21,127 --> 01:41:22,971
- You’re still there?
- I’m goin’, I’m goin’!

716
01:41:26,354 --> 01:41:29,336
We’re done for! Nobody can stop
those machines!

717
01:41:30,212 --> 01:41:32,774
Except the SWAT Kats. I hope.

718
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:42,691
- Callie’s calling on the distress band!
- One crisis at a time! Guess it’s time
for Plan Z!

719
01:41:43,253 --> 01:41:49,128
- T-Bone, I hate Plan Z!
- No other choice, kiddo. Prepare for
engine shutdown!

720
01:41:51,931 --> 01:41:54,816
Engine’s cold. Launching Decoy
Missile!

721
01:42:03,253 --> 01:42:10,568
- Great job, T-Bone. What a team!
- We’re not outta the woods yet! The
engines won’t restart!

722
01:42:11,582 --> 01:42:14,631
This is why I hate Plan Z!

723
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:20,556
I don’t know about you, but I’m
getting the heck out of here!

724
01:42:21,277 --> 01:42:24,590
Mayor, stop! The other robot’s in the
building somewhere!

725
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:30,350
- We have to eject!
- No way!

726
01:42:31,942 --> 01:42:36,863
- Oh, how did I know you were gonna
say that? - C’mon, baby, you can do it!

727
01:42:38,226 --> 01:42:40,654
One tiny miracle is all I ask!

728
01:42:46,567 --> 01:42:55,005
I thought we bought the big litterbox for sure
that time! Ah, but the Turbokat came through
for us, just like always.

729
01:42:55,623 --> 01:42:59,288
- T-Bone, it’s Callie again.
- Yes, Miss Briggs? What’s the problem?

730
01:42:59,998 --> 01:43:04,288
I’m in the Mayor’s office, T-Bone, and
right now I could really, really, use your help!

731
01:43:05,692 --> 01:43:06,709
Mayor’s office!

732
01:43:15,176 --> 01:43:16,199
Come on, come on.

733
01:43:19,747 --> 01:43:22,703
Mayor Manx, I was just lookin’ for you!

734
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:31,967
- Well, well. Look what the kat dragged in.
- Please, please, I beg you! I’ll make any
deal just don’t hurt me!

735
01:43:32,715 --> 01:43:39,437
Too late, Mayor. You had your chance to
make a deal with us earlier, when we offered
you a fat bribe for our parole.

736
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:41,938
But ya turned us down.

737
01:43:42,812 --> 01:43:51,686
Bribe? I swear I don’t know what you’re talking
about! Molly, please. Life’s just dealt you
some bad cards, that’s all.

738
01:43:54,623 --> 01:44:02,828
No! You dealt us the bad hand! You
don’t get it, do ya? It began two months ago,
on Alkatraz Island.

739
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:14,677
- Okay, first Katscratch.
- What about money, and transportation?

740
01:44:15,174 --> 01:44:22,244
- Okay, okay! First the bank, then Katscratch.
- We’d get there faster if you’d help me row.

741
01:44:22,691 --> 01:44:24,847
- Shut up! I hear somethin’.
- Whaddaya hear?

742
01:44:25,566 --> 01:44:28,211
I dunno! Can’t see a thing in
this soup…

743
01:44:54,721 --> 01:45:00,742
I’m still alive. What’s wrong with
my body? Mac? Mac, where are you?

744
01:45:01,245 --> 01:45:07,214
- Behind ya, Molly.
- Mac, we’re all silvery and weird! What’s
happened to us?

745
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:11,899
I don’t know, but I’m gonna wring the
neck of the guy who did this to us!

746
01:45:12,756 --> 01:45:17,692
That would be my neck, young fellow.
I think the masks are good likenessess.

747
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:24,909
I’ll create full bodysuits for you
to wear. No sense scaring everybody every
time you go into public.

748
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:28,379
- Who are you?
- Why’d you do this to us?

749
01:45:28,879 --> 01:45:33,971
My name is Professor Hackle.
When my robots found you, your bodies
were destroyed.

750
01:45:35,019 --> 01:45:38,694
The only way to save you was to
plant your minds inside my robots.

751
01:45:39,316 --> 01:45:42,784
We’re robots?! You turned us
into tin cans?!

752
01:45:43,285 --> 01:45:53,035
I know this is a shock, but in every
way, you are faster and stronger. The only
differance now is your bodies are steel,
instead of flesh.

753
01:45:53,744 --> 01:45:58,808
- We’ve still got our brains, right?
- I’ve transferred your memories onto
a hard disk.

754
01:45:59,508 --> 01:46:00,817
Mac, I don’t like this.

755
01:46:01,341 --> 01:46:09,276
I dunno, I think I could get to like this.
I’ve never felt so powerful, like I could rip
apart this whole town with my bare claws!

756
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:14,288
Indeed you could, my boy, but fate
has delivered you to me for another reason.

757
01:46:18,137 --> 01:46:25,601
My whole life I have created such weapons
of destruction for the military. Laser weapons,
rockets, even bombs.

758
01:46:26,724 --> 01:46:35,093
However, now I have
turned my efforts toward making a contribution
to katkind. That is why you two are so important.

759
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:43,662
As soon as you are healed, I will present you both
to the scientific acadamy. Imagine the great minds
that could be saved...

760
01:46:44,245 --> 01:46:50,975
...with this form of brain transplant. And history
will forgive me. Goodnight, children. Sleep well.

761
01:46:51,662 --> 01:46:54,851
- Sleep well.
- Yeah, goodnight, Professor.

762
01:46:57,056 --> 01:47:02,413
-  Imagine leavin’ us alone to swipe all this
loot! - Yeah, what a sucker!

763
01:47:05,122 --> 01:47:11,272
- Hey Mac, look at this!
- Kats alive! Transportation! Let’s go to town!

764
01:47:15,725 --> 01:47:18,656
End of story, end of you!

765
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:25,790
Leave him alone, you metal morons! He
didn’t turn down your parole, I did!

766
01:47:26,476 --> 01:47:27,727
And who are you?

767
01:47:27,975 --> 01:47:32,624
Calico Briggs, Deputy Mayor. Manx hasn’t
done an ounce of paperwork around here for years!

768
01:47:33,226 --> 01:47:35,844
I turned down you parole,
bribes and all.

769
01:47:36,291 --> 01:47:42,664
- You? You let us rot inside that prison?
- That’s right, sister! And I’d do it again in a
heartbeat!

770
01:47:49,937 --> 01:47:55,792
- You don’t scare me, you brass bimbo!
- Remember to land on your feet, Deputy
Mayor!

771
01:48:14,251 --> 01:48:20,404
- Hey, need a lift?
- It’s about time, you guys! Catch you on
your lunch hour?

772
01:48:24,846 --> 01:48:26,468
- Careful, Miss Briggs.
- Thanks, Razor.

773
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:36,042
- Think you can handle the Mayor while I go
ather them? - “Think you can handle the Mayor?”

774
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:40,542
I’m gonna get the Mayor,
you stay here!

775
01:48:50,062 --> 01:48:50,938
Right here, Mac!

776
01:48:55,219 --> 01:48:57,275
Hey, I guess we’re better built
than I thought.

777
01:49:09,524 --> 01:49:12,539
Don’t you know a rust-proof robot
when you see one?

778
01:49:18,939 --> 01:49:22,362
Party’s over! Aah! That ashtray!

779
01:49:23,908 --> 01:49:32,470
- The sand jammed the gun, and my parts, too!
- Well, Mayor, any parting words for your
fellow citizens?

780
01:49:33,898 --> 01:49:38,252
- Molly! I don’t feel so good…
- Mac!

781
01:49:43,503 --> 01:49:48,191
- Mac!
-  I didn’t do it! It’s not my fault!

782
01:49:48,596 --> 01:49:52,098
Jump, Mayor! Jump on the wing!

783
01:49:59,724 --> 01:50:01,693
Hey, lady! Don’t mess up my jet!

784
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:17,441
That’s it, right this way.
Come on in.

785
01:50:23,066 --> 01:50:25,246
I asked you nicely!

786
01:50:44,536 --> 01:50:48,676
Thank you, SWAT Kats! And don’t
forget about SWAT Kat Day!

787
01:50:50,163 --> 01:50:51,912
Are you really going to have
a SWAT Kat Day?

788
01:50:52,379 --> 01:50:57,226
Don’t be ridiculous. How would it
look if I through a parade for a couple of
vigilantes?

789
01:50:57,498 --> 01:51:03,722
I was just being polite. Feral!
Have this mess cleaned up! Take it to the
metal salvage yard!

790
01:51:09,038 --> 01:51:13,190
- Well, there you go, Professor Hackle.
- Oh, yes. Thank you, lads.

791
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:18,556
- This will advance my research considerabley.
- Sure, Professor. Glad to help.

792
01:51:20,613 --> 01:51:30,551
You two have been very naughty!
I’ve been looking for you for days! I’m afraid
I’ll have to make some adjustments on you
two before I can allow you to be examined by
the acadamy.

793
01:51:31,095 --> 01:51:35,972
- Since you’re gonna make adjustments,
why don’t you make him taller?
- And her better lookin’!

794
01:51:36,532 --> 01:51:41,189
- Must you two always argue?
- Better lookin’?! Listen Mr. Cyclops...

795
01:51:41,711 --> 01:51:47,251
- ...you ain’t exactly easy on the eyes yourself.
- Hey, Professor, can you make it so she
can’t talk?

796
01:51:47,689 --> 01:51:49,586
Oh, drop dead!
