1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,400
(folk song playing )

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,300
¶ I wanna die ¶

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,700
¶ I wanna die ¶

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,300
¶ Down south Louisiana ¶

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,900
¶ And grey evening sky.¶

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,500
Woman:
June 21st.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,800
Exile to Siberia.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,400
I mean, New Jersey.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Is there a difference?

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,300
I can't tell.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,800
Isn't Siberia the place
they send you to die?

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
And from my experience

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,800
Ocean Grove isn't that much different.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
I think the median age is 85

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,900
with the life expectancy of 86.

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,000
Sounds about right to me.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,300
Thanks, Mom.

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,900
Thank you for buying me
a one-way ticket to hell.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,700
I mean,
Grams' and Gramps' mausoleum.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,100
where it always smells like
desiccated socks.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,200
Oh, I'm sure they're thrilled too.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,400
It'll just be one great summer
of Chinese torture for all of us.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,900
Who cares anyway?

24
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,900
Nobody.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,000
Actually, maybe Ocean Grove
is the perfect place for me.

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,300
In fact, when I get off this bus

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,000
I should just walk over to the pier
and jump,

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,300
end it all.

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,100
Goodbye, world.
Goodbye, New Jersey.

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,300
The truth is, if I weren't around,

31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,900
it would solve everyone's problems.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,900
Mom could really focus
on saving marriage number nine.

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
And my grandmother--

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,400
well, she could spend
her whole summer

35
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,000
making those seashell
thingies she makes.

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,900
And Gramps could finally finish

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,700
fixing up that boat of his.

38
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,300
Yeah, Grams definitely wouldn't care
if I weren't around.

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,500
I swear she has some serious
anxiety issues.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,100
Maybe I should give her
some of my pills.

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,100
That's what I should do--

42
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,200
make it easy on everyone.

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,500
If I weren't here,
their lives would be better.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,600
There's only one person
who might actually care,

45
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,600
but Dad isn't around anymore.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,800
( man snoring )

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,400
( coughing )

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
Buses suck, huh?

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,400
Great. Hello, New Jersey!

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,500
Good times, good times.

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,300
Hi, sweetie.

52
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,000
Greta, how nice to see you.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,900
Gramps, Grams, hi.

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,800
You folks don't look so bad,

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,300
all things considered.

56
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,300
Hello to you too, Greta.

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Yeah, hello hello.

58
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,600
We all know why I'm here.
No need to act thrilled about it.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,600
We're glad to have you here, honey.
We really are.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,900
Yeah, well, I didn't really plan
on spending my summer in Jersey,

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,700
in what might as well be
a nursing home.

62
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,400
Gramps: Well, I guess you're glad
to be out of school for the summer, right?

63
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,800
If I cared one microbe
about school,

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I guess yeah, it'd be some kind
of a relief.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,000
Your mother said
you were on the honor roll all year.

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
That's terrific.

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,500
You should be proud of yourself.
You'll get into a good college.

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm not going to college.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,700
Of course you're going
to college.

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,900
The fact is that I'm gonna kill myself
before I turn 18,

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
so that doesn't really leave much time
for an undergraduate degree.

72
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,100
I assume that you understand

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,300
that a joke is supposed
to be funny.

74
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,600
It's not a joke.

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,000
See, I've been making this list
of all the different ways you can die--

76
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,700
self-immolation,

77
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
falling from a great height.

78
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,400
I don't know about electrocution.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,700
I hear that your heart actually cooks
and you puke up your melted guts.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,800
All right, Greta, just stop.
Just stop right now.

81
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,100
Well, at the same time,
I've been making this list

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
of things that I want to do
before I die.

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,100
For instance,
I want to eat a bug

84
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,000
just to say that I did.

85
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,600
I want to get in a fistfight
with a grown man.

86
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,900
Don't ask.

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,100
I want to learn
how to really paint,

88
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,600
and maybe get a tattoo.

89
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,300
Anyway, as soon as I choose
my method of death

90
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,800
then I'm gonna cross as much off
my to-do list as I can

91
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,400
and commit some kind of
grizzly suicide.

92
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,900
Voilà.

93
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,500
You won't have Greta
to kick around anymore.

94
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,800
Come on, Greta.

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,100
Well, look who it is.

96
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,700
You certainly have grown up
to be quite the pretty young lady

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,500
under all that makeup.

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,700
Mrs. Wocheski,
same nosy old bag.

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
What? What's that?

100
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
I said, "Isn't this heat a drag?"

101
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,600
A drag?

102
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey, did you hear about
that huge hunk of space junk

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,300
that landed in some
old lady's home

104
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,400
just about a month ago
right here in Jersey?

105
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,500
Jersey?

106
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
( whispering ) The universe is just
loaded with things that we've left up there.

107
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,000
- What?
- And all of a sudden--

108
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,400
- Bam!
- Whaa!

109
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,900
Instantly vaporized.

110
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,200
( barking )

111
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,200
¶ I don't know what to do
about you ¶

112
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,400
I left your things upstairs,
honey.

113
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,400
¶ I learned a lot of rules
from the Bible, baby ¶

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,500
¶ But I wonder wonder
what I should do ¶

115
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,300
¶ But I wonder wonder
what I should do ¶

116
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,300
¶ I don't know
why I'm staying with you ¶

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,200
¶ If everything they're saying
is true ¶

118
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,300
¶ I heard about you lying
to your mama, baby ¶

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,700
¶ And I wonder wonder
what I should do ¶

120
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,000
¶ But I wonder wonder
what I should do. ¶

121
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
( cat mewing )

122
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,300
Parnelli.

123
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,300
Hey.

124
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,200
What's it like living with the mummies
of Guanajuato?

125
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
Do you ever get used
to that smell?

126
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,000
Hmm?

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,900
You don't care,

128
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,400
as long as someone feeds you
and scoops your litter.

129
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a pretty good deal,
a life you want anyway.

130
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,000
( teapot whistling )

131
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Katherine: I'm trying not to be
judgmental, Joseph,

132
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,200
but she's a handful.

133
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,700
Joseph: Oh, Katherine,
it's only three months.

134
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,800
September will be here
before you know it.

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,200
You don't think
she's serious, do you?

136
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,000
No, I think she's just
being dramatic,

137
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,700
trying to push our buttons.

138
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,900
Yeah, you know who she
reminds me of at that age?

139
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,300
Karen.

140
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,100
Ow. I'm nothing like my mother!

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,100
Nothing!

142
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,000
Hey, Gramps,
can I bump a $20?

143
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,100
Mm!

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,500
Greta, we have rules
in this house.

145
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,200
I assume your mother
told you about them.

146
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,800
Yeah.

147
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,900
I'm sure she did.

148
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm also sure
I wasn't paying attention.

149
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,100
Oh, well,

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
then listen to me.

151
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,000
Now you can have
a very nice summer here,

152
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,400
but it won't be
without structure and supervision.

153
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Now if you want to have
spending money,

154
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,800
you're going to have to
get a job.

155
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,500
And there will be
a 10:00 PM curfew.

156
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,200
And you're not permitted
beyond the town lines,

157
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,500
especially not to Asbury Park.
That's no place for you.

158
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,300
So does all of that
sound fair to you?

159
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,900
Let me tell you how this works:

160
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,600
I go where I want
when I want with whom I want.

161
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,000
And I don't come home
until I want to.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now that's how it works
at Karen's.

163
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,400
So if you've got a problem with it,
take it up with her.

164
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,200
She's the one who dumped me
on you two anyway.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay? Let's just do each other
a favor,

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,900
stay out of each other's way.

167
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Summer will be over
before we know it.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,300
Deal?

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,700
Deal.

170
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
( whistles )

171
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
Where did you get that?

172
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,800
Oh, yeah.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
What does that thing get,

174
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,800
90 yards to a gallon?

175
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,900
Only on a steep downgrade.

176
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,400
Can I borrow it?

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,500
Huh-uh. I heard about what happened
when you went to get your driver's license.

178
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,500
That DMV guy
was emotionally unstable, okay?

179
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,900
It was not my driving
that made him cry.

180
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,000
( Joseph guffaws )

181
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm serious.

182
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,500
Okay, we'll see
what your mother thinks.

183
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Like she thinks.

184
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,800
I swear she holds the record
for the most blah moments.

185
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,200
She thinks that string theory
has something to do with macramé.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,400
This is the same woman
that gives me advice on boys.

187
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,600
Her husbands are in and out so fast,
I can't even keep track.

188
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,400
What, is this
husband number nine?

189
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,300
Three.

190
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,500
And you can't drive alone
without a license.

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,500
It's against the law.

192
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,800
What's the worst
that's gonna happen, Grams?

193
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,000
I die?

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
No, the worst thing
that can happen

195
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,600
is that you take somebody
with you when you die.

196
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Greta: Ocean Grove.

197
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,400
More like Ocean Grave.

198
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,000
No wonder Mom left this place
when she was 17.

199
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,400
It's so passé.

200
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,200
I'll make her pay for this torture
when I get home.

201
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,900
That is, if I make it home.

202
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,400
Wow. Okay, I'll give it to her--

203
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Grams looked pretty.

204
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,900
( changing channels )

205
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
( turns off TV )

206
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,700
( tinkling )

207
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,000
Can I help you?

208
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,300
There's something majorly wrong
with the cable.

209
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
I think you ought to call
and light a fire under someone's ass.

210
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,600
We don't have cable.

211
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Wait, say that again.

212
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,100
I said we don't--

213
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,200
What are you wear--?
Oh, look at you.

214
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,600
How do you survive
without cable?

215
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,400
It's really tough, Greta.

216
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,500
Sometimes we cry ourselves
to sleep at night.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,300
You know, you can always
rent videotapes.

218
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Videotapes?

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,100
Come on, who lives like this?

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,700
Oh, stop the histrionics, Greta,
for goodness' sakes.

221
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
There's so much to do
around here.

222
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
There's the whole ocean
right there.

223
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,900
Take my bicycle.
Ride along the boardwalk.

224
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,000
Then you won't have time
for TV.

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,700
So you want me to sacrifice
reality TV

226
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,900
for purely empirical
experiences?

227
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Yeah, that's my
recommendation.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Fine.

229
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,000
¶ Come with me ¶

230
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,600
¶ Come with me ¶

231
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,300
¶ On a voyage ¶

232
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
¶ To the bottom ¶

233
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,900
¶ Of the sea ¶

234
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,300
¶ In a sea ¶

235
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,100
¶Of blue-green ¶

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,800
¶ We will find love ¶

237
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
¶ At the bottom ¶

238
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,500
¶ Of the sea ¶

239
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,700
¶ Unbelievable, inconceivable ¶

240
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,600
¶ Fantastic it will seem ¶

241
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,100
¶ But we'll be the first ¶

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,300
¶ The very first ¶

243
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,900
¶ To live such a strange ¶

244
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,100
¶ New dream ¶

245
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,900
¶ There we'll be ¶

246
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,400
¶ Lost and free ¶

247
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,000
¶ On our voyage ¶

248
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,600
¶ To the bottom ¶

249
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,000
¶ Of the sea ¶

250
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
¶ Come with me ¶

251
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,900
¶ On our voyage ¶

252
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,100
¶ To the bottom ¶

253
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
¶ Of the sea. ¶

254
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,400
Greta: They say that drowning
and freezing to death

255
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,500
are the nicest ways to die,
euphoric even.

256
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,400
I wonder how they would
know that.

257
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,700
The way I see it, what does
experience have to do with anything?

258
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,900
I mean, I've been served
by 1000 waitresses

259
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
and the job just doesn't
seem that tough.

260
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm sure it has its nuances
just like anything else,

261
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,000
but I'll figure it out.

262
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,800
You're soaking wet.

263
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,500
Oh, come on, Lou.

264
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,100
I'd say the wet T-shirt look
definitely trumps experience.

265
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,700
Does he have
all of his shots?

266
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,400
Let me get you an application.

267
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,100
What the hell for?
It's a yes or no decision.

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
Not really. It's--

269
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,100
Hey, Lou, give her the job.
You're gonna give it to her anyway.

270
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,200
Zip it, Julie.

271
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
See, this is how it works--

272
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,400
you ask him something;
he pretends to chew on it.

273
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,100
He can't say no to nobody,
so you got the job. Don't worry about it.

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,300
I don't need your help.

275
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,800
I ain't trying to help you.
Hell, I don't even know you.

276
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm trying to help my boy.
One more night that he's shorthanded--

277
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
he's gonna develop an ulcer
and it's gonna be problematic for all of us.

278
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Get back to the dungeon.

279
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm just saying, man.
I'm just saying.

280
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,400
I can start tomorrow.
Would you like me here at 4:00?

281
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,400
Um...

282
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Or how about lunch?

283
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,600
Then I can learn everything.
It'll be all good.

284
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,600
Uh...

285
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Great. See you then.

286
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,600
Hey, that girl's trouble.

287
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I think I just hired her.

288
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,100
( chattering, laughing )

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,900
Oh my God, you guys
are still awake?

290
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,900
You do realize
it's past 9:00, right?

291
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,800
You realize
that you missed dinner?

292
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,900
What happened to my dress?

293
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,300
Oh, I went swimming.

294
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,300
New York doesn't use that ocean
as a toilet, do they?

295
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,400
Is my hair starting
to turn green?

296
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Greta, I really don't mind
you wearing my dress.

297
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,600
I do mind you going swimming in it.
Would you take it off, please?

298
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,200
Greta, your mother called.

299
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,900
You were supposed to let her know
you got down here all right.

300
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,400
Well, did you tell her
that I was still alive?

301
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,100
Why don't you tell her?
There's a phone on the piano.

302
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,400
- Are you taking that?
- Yes, I am.

303
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,100
- You're in deep trouble now.
- Come on.

304
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,200
- Gin.
- Oh, no.

305
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
It's me.
What do you want?

306
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,500
Karen: I see you survived
the bus trip after all.

307
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,200
I'd rather have ferried
across the River Styx.

308
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,000
Grams told me about your little
to-die list.

309
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,000
You shouldn't scare her
like that.

310
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
She doesn't know you well enough
to understand.

311
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,500
How's my old room look?

312
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
Does she still have
her seashells everywhere?

313
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,100
It's a shell hole, Mom.

314
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,100
Why are you doing this to me?

315
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Karen: You know why.
We've discussed this.

316
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,000
I am trying
to save my marriage.

317
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,600
You would have better luck

318
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,400
trying to save
the polar ice caps, Mom.

319
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,700
Why is it that your marriage only works
when I'm not there?

320
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,700
Sweetie,

321
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,300
Greta, I know this is tough,
but try to make the best of it.

322
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Take as much time
as you need, okay, Karen?

323
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,500
Sort things out,
shuffle them together,

324
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,400
do whatever the hell it is
you need to do

325
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,300
to try and save
this marriage, okay?

326
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm here and I'm fine.
Don't even worry about me.

327
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm fine!

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
¶ Trouble ¶

329
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,300
¶ Oh, trouble, set me free ¶

330
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
¶ I have seen your face ¶

331
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
¶ And it's too much, too much
for me. ¶

332
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Greta: If Dad were alive,

333
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
he'd let me drive the car.

334
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,900
And we'd do stuff like paint.

335
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,900
Maybe I'd be friends
with the kid down the street.

336
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,600
Mom and he would argue
about petunias instead of money.

337
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,700
If Dad were alive,

338
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,000
he'd teach me
how to play the guitar.

339
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,600
If Dad were alive.
If Dad were alive.

340
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,700
¶ I drank your wine ¶

341
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,200
¶ And you have made
your world mine ¶

342
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,400
¶ So won't you be fair? ¶

343
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,100
¶ So won't you be fair? ¶

344
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,800
¶ I don't want ¶

345
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,300
¶ No more of you ¶

346
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
¶ So won't you be kind
to me? ¶

347
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,500
¶ Just let me go there ¶

348
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
¶ I have to go there ¶

349
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,600
¶ Trouble ¶

350
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,300
¶ Oh, trouble, please be kind ¶

351
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,500
¶ I don't want no fight ¶

352
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,000
¶ And I haven't got
a lot of time. ¶

353
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,900
( jazz music playing )

354
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,500
No, I ordered the High Tide.

355
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
The Red Squall is mine.

356
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
You expect me to remember
what you ordered?

357
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Figure it out yourselves.

358
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,800
You guys have had plenty of time
to look over this lousy menu.

359
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,200
So what's it gonna be?

360
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,900
Is everybody ready?

361
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,200
- No.
- I think we need another minute.

362
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,400
If I walk away from this table
without an order,

363
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,300
I'm not coming back
for another 20 minutes.

364
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
I hope by then
you've got it figured out.

365
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,800
I know what I want.

366
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,300
Yeah? Well, I see
who the decision-maker is here.

367
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,900
What will it be?

368
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,900
I will have the chicken breast.

369
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,700
What the hell is wrong with you?

370
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,500
You come to a seafood restaurant
and order chicken?

371
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,800
Well, the other stuff
is expensive.

372
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,000
That's because it tastes good.

373
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,700
Come on, Stacy,
order the lobster.

374
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,300
You can even pick it out
if you're feeling particularly sadistic.

375
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,600
Do you like shrimp?

376
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,300
We have a spectacular
shrimp cocktail,

377
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,500
if you don't mind ripping apart
their freaky exoskeletons.

378
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,200
They have a lot of cholesterol,
don't they?

379
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,800
Not half as much
as the lobster.

380
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Oh my God.

381
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,000
Listen, you could die
on a car ride home tonight,

382
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,300
and you're worried
about a little bypass surgery

383
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,500
20 years down the road?
Relax.

384
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,100
You're gonna get the shrimp cocktail
and the poached lobster.

385
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,100
Who's next?

386
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,900
Not bad for a kid
learning the ropes.

387
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,300
Welcome aboard, Greta.

388
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,900
Thanks.

389
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,900
Hey, that seafaring lingo
that you do--

390
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,100
you don't do that
all the time, right?

391
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,200
Yeah, I want to see a collar
from now on.

392
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,500
This is a respectable place.

393
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,700
Aye aye, Captain.

394
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,800
Oh my God.

395
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Hey, you got a car?

396
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,300
Seeing as I don't have a license, no.

397
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,500
Yeah, well,

398
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,500
why don't you stick around
a little while?

399
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,000
And I will get you home safely.

400
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,100
Uh, thanks, Voltaire,

401
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,200
but I can take care of myself
all right?

402
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,100
Anyway, I'm only 17.

403
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,600
What, are you, like, 40?

404
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,700
Hey, Lou,

405
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,100
what's a Voltaire?

406
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,200
Does Lou know that you're
feeding his food to the strays?

407
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,300
It's just garbage.

408
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Lou know that you think
his food is garbage?

409
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,700
No, I mean it's going
in the garbage.

410
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,800
It's just a joke.

411
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,900
Hold on.

412
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,800
My name's Julie.

413
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm Greta,

414
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,000
which is just a thinly disguised
anagram for "great."

415
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay.

416
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,800
You didn't thank me
for getting you hired.

417
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
That's 'cause I already
hate the job.

418
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,800
It's only been one day.

419
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,000
( distant siren wailing )

420
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,300
( distant siren wailing )

421
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,400
( car alarm whooping )

422
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
What's up, little girl?

423
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,000
( helicopter blades whirring )

424
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,900
- Man: Check this out.
- Man #2: Yeah, look at that.

425
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,800
Hey, slice, like at you.

426
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,900
Baby, can I walk with you?

427
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,100
No.

428
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh, she cold.

429
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,700
Yeah, that's right.

430
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,400
( woman singing )

431
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Woman: What are you
looking at?

432
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,500
( men and women arguing )

433
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,100
Man: What did I say?
What did I just say?

434
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,300
Woman: I'm not giving it to you
no matter what.

435
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,000
( siren whooping )

436
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,500
Parnelli.

437
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,800
Where are you?

438
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,000
Parnelli, time to come in.

439
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
( police radio chatter )

440
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,100
Parnelli.

441
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,000
Thanks for the ride.

442
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,400
- Stay out of trouble, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

443
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,900
Grams, don't worry.

444
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,300
They're trumped up charges.
Jury's got nothing on me.

445
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,400
What?

446
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,200
We found her over
in Asbury Park.

447
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,200
She got a little scared,
so we brought her home.

448
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,200
Oh.

449
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,900
Oh, thank you.

450
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
( knocks on door )

451
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,300
What happened?

452
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,900
Come right in, Grams.
Don't bother waiting for an invitation.

453
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Now you see why I told you

454
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,100
to stay away
from Asbury Park.

455
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Well, you piqued
my curiosity, okay?

456
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,600
Oh, I see.
It was all my fault.

457
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
If you don't want me
to do something,

458
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,500
don't plant the idea
in my head.

459
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,100
I'm just trying
to protect you.

460
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,700
It's a little late.

461
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm really tired, Grams.

462
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,000
Good night.

463
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,600
Good night.

464
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,000
Well, I admit
she's a bit of a challenge, but--

465
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,300
Well, I admit
she's a bit of a challenge, but--

466
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,500
What?

467
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,100
A challenge.
I say she's a challenge.

468
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
A challenge?
She's a pain in the butt.

469
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Good morning.

470
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,500
Oh, love,

471
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,900
it seems Greta is giving
Mrs. Wocheski some difficulty.

472
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,300
There's no "seems" about it.
She is.

473
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,500
She said Mr. Poodles
was just a mangy rodent

474
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,700
and not a real dog at all.

475
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,800
And then she said
he looks just like me.

476
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,600
Are you sure you heard her
correctly?

477
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
What?

478
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,300
I said I'm sure she meant it
in the sweetest possible way.

479
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,300
Oh, she's a menace,
that girl.

480
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,000
You'd better keep
a sharp eye out.

481
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,200
Well, we'll see to it
that she apologizes.

482
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Won't we, dear?

483
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,200
Are you done?

484
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,500
I wish.

485
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,700
- Well, how much longer?
- Just a bit.

486
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,000
Excuse me, is that
your van outside?

487
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,300
Yes, ma'am.
I'm hooking it up right now.

488
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,900
Well, I didn't order any hooking up,
so you just go ahead

489
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
and unhook
whatever it is you hooked.

490
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,500
Grams, I'm paying for this.

491
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,700
That's not the point.

492
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,700
You're gonna love this, okay?

493
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,300
I don't want cable.

494
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,000
Look, I'm almost done here,
so if you don't want this--

495
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,800
Grams, it's guaranteed to keep me
out of trouble the whole summer.

496
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,200
And it's not costing you
a thing.

497
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,300
We've got to send her home.

498
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,400
I can't do it.
I just can't take it anymore.

499
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,100
Oh, honey, so she wants
the cable TV.

500
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
What's the harm in that?

501
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,300
Katherine: That's the point.
She does whatever she wants to do.

502
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,900
She has no boundaries.

503
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,700
Karen's always been
too permissive with her.

504
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay, that'll do it.

505
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,200
Finally.

506
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,800
This here is your remote.
What you do is--

507
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,200
Yeah, I got it, okay?
Scram.

508
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,100
All right, just--

509
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,300
I just need a signature here.

510
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,400
- ( flipping channels )
- Ma'am?

511
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,500
Sir?

512
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,800
- I just need a signature.
- Okay, I got it.

513
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,300
- Hey.
- I told Mrs. Wocheski

514
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,300
that you would apologize
for that smart-alecky remark

515
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,300
you made about her dog.

516
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,100
Now please go do it.

517
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,800
I can't believe you would
sell out your own granddaughter

518
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,100
to that old blue-hair.

519
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
It's not even blue
in a good way.

520
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,400
Go.

521
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,300
Now.

522
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,400
We thought we heard
someone at the door.

523
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,600
You ratted me out
to my grandparents.

524
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,500
I most certainly did.

525
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,100
And I believe you owe me
an apology.

526
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,900
You know,

527
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,500
I noticed you keep those windows
pretty much open all the time.

528
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,000
Of course I do.
The breeze is healthy.

529
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
Yeah?

530
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
What time do you go to bed
around usually,

531
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,800
7:30, 8:00-ish?

532
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,100
What are you getting at?

533
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,200
( chuckles )

534
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,700
You don't scare me.

535
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,700
Mm-hmm.

536
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
You don't scare me.

537
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
( dog yapping )

538
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,700
( patrons chattering )

539
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,500
Give me just one second here.

540
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Uh, okay.

541
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,400
How's the perch?

542
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,000
How should I know?

543
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,400
I'm sorry?

544
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,100
It's perch.
I'm sure it's fresh.

545
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,200
I'm sure it tastes
how perch usually does.

546
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,800
I can't afford to eat here,
so how should I know?

547
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,100
There's no need to be rude.

548
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,200
Woman: Table 12.

549
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,000
Man: Can I get a side
of horseradish?

550
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,600
What's the perch taste like?

551
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,600
What?

552
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
The perch-- how is it?

553
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,700
It's all right,
but the catfish is the business.

554
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,500
Yeah? What's that
taste like?

555
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,400
Are you telling me you've never
tried fish before?

556
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,900
Yeah, I have.

557
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay, I'm not talking
out of the box or the can.

558
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,700
What kind of wonk
has never tasted fish before?

559
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,200
Okay, maybe not.

560
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,700
Come around here.
I'm gonna show you what it tastes like.

561
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,200
Come on.

562
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,600
Okay, now this right here
is perch, all right?

563
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,000
Now hold on.
Stay here.

564
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,900
Now this is catfish,

565
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,200
Cajun blackened, okay?

566
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,600
Okay.

567
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,800
It's my favorite.

568
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,400
Mm.

569
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,900
You made that?

570
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,100
Yeah.

571
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,200
Well, that is
surprisingly edible.

572
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,400
Well, I'm glad you like it.

573
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Man: Hey, Julie.

574
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Man #2: I need another special.

575
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,900
You don't want the perch.

576
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,300
What's this?

577
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
Catfish.

578
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
But I wanted the perch.

579
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,300
No, trust me,
you want the catfish.

580
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,500
The perch is all right,

581
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,000
the catfish is the business.

582
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
( distant siren wailing )

583
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,500
You know, it's really gonna be
really hard for you to ride that bike

584
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
with my foot
shoved up your ass.

585
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Wow.

586
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,400
Oh, it's you. I thought you were
these guys from the other night.

587
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,200
- You ever let it down?
- What?

588
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Your force field.

589
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You know, you walk around
all up in your own shit

590
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,400
like you ain't got no time
for nobody else's goodness.

591
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,100
How does somebody get close enough
to give you what you need?

592
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I don't need anything.

593
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,700
Everybody needs something.

594
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,500
As of right now, seems like
you might need a ride.

595
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,400
On that?

596
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,800
Yeah.

597
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,700
I don't think two bodies
can fit on that.

598
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,700
What, is it, like,
your little brother's bike?

599
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,300
Okay, let me tell you something
about this right here.

600
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,700
This is a masterpiece
of engineering.

601
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,400
This is the product
of my love and sweat.

602
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,600
And it can and will prove you wrong.
But as of right now,

603
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,300
I don't think I even want
to let you on this thing.

604
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,200
I mean, unless-- and I mean,
only if you promise to be sweet.

605
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Promise.

606
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,400
Are you always
that sensitive?

607
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
I mean, didn't your mama
breastfeed you?

608
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay, that would be classified
as sour in my kitchen.

609
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,200
But I'm gonna pretend
that didn't happen.

610
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
Okay? Come on.

611
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,300
Now you promise
to be sweet, right?

612
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,500
Yeah.

613
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
I promise.

614
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,100
¶ She's mine ¶

615
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,900
¶ She's mine ¶

616
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,300
¶ She's mine ¶

617
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,400
¶ All mine ¶

618
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,800
¶ Yeah, she's mine ¶

619
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
¶ Mine ¶

620
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,800
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, what's up?

621
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,500
Forget you.

622
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,800
¶ Yes, she's mine ¶

623
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,300
¶ Mine ¶

624
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,600
¶ Yeah, mine ¶

625
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,100
¶ Yeah, she's mine. ¶

626
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,300
She must have been pretty.

627
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,400
Who?

628
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,900
RS.

629
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,600
RS was a he.

630
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,200
No, not like that.

631
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,100
He was a good friend of mine.

632
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,400
Does he have your initials
tattooed on his wrist?

633
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,900
No.

634
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,100
Why not?

635
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,500
'Cause I'm not dead.

636
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,600
( distant train horn whistles )

637
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Is this what you guys do
for fun around here?

638
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,400
I kind of try
not to have fun.

639
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,300
I try to stay working.

640
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,500
I got this great talent
for finding trouble

641
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,900
and getting all up in it,

642
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
so I stay busy.

643
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,400
You want to be a chef?

644
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,600
Yeah, I want my own restaurant.

645
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,800
Where did you learn
how to cook anyway,

646
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,200
home ec?

647
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,100
No, prison.

648
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,700
You lie.

649
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,400
No, for real.
I was at juvie.

650
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,000
I was younger then.

651
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
What were you in for?

652
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,200
Joyriding.

653
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,800
( harrumphs )
You're full of it.

654
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,000
I mean, it's not something
I'm trying to brag about.

655
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,700
I'm not proud of it.

656
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,500
Stealing cars, huh?

657
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,800
That's joyriding.

658
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,800
But I'm not into that anymore.

659
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,100
So the correctional system

660
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,700
totally corrected you.

661
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,700
Let me tell you something--

662
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,200
it's a miracle
that I'm even on the outside.

663
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,400
Where I'm at--
I did that, you know.

664
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,700
So if I go back--
I did that too.

665
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,000
That's cool.

666
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,100
Yeah.

667
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,500
But you'd still steal me
a BMW, right?

668
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,800
For you-- anything.
I got you.

669
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,800
I just don't know
why you don't like my BMX.

670
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,800
It's the sickest right here.

671
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,100
Greta: Why do I say
the things I do?

672
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,400
They just come out
totally wrong.

673
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,400
Sometimes I just wish
I wouldn't say anything at all.

674
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,800
I like him.

675
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,700
Narrator:
...hundreds of others.

676
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,500
Interpreter: Handcuffed me, beat me,
denied me food and water.

677
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Narrator:
Palden Gyatso endured

678
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,200
33 years of torture
in Chinese prison camps.

679
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,800
Uh, come on.
We found a show

680
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,700
I'd like to watch.
Let's watch it.

681
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,600
- Morning, ladies.
- ( cell phone ringing )

682
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,000
- Hi, love.
- Hey, Gramps.

683
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,100
You want to go down
to the marina with me today,

684
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
help me work on my boat?

685
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
I can't, sorry.

686
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,700
I'm gonna hook up
with my friend Julie.

687
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,200
Julie?
You're making new friends already.

688
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,800
Why don't you invite
Julie to lunch?

689
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,400
Okay.

690
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,900
That's a good idea.

691
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,700
Good morning, ma'am.

692
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,600
We're not interested.

693
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,500
Is Greta here?

694
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,700
Hey. Grams, this is Julie.

695
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
How do you do, ma'am?

696
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,600
Everything looks really great.

697
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,400
Thank you.

698
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,100
Julie knows food.

699
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,600
He's a chef.

700
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,200
Really?

701
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,800
No, I'm just a line cook,

702
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
but I'm working on
becoming one.

703
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,600
I hope to own
my own restaurant one day.

704
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Why don't you tell them
where you learned how to cook?

705
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
He learned in prison.

706
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,600
He got busted
for stealing cars.

707
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,000
Something the matter, Grams?

708
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,600
So that would make you
an ex-con?

709
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Yeah, but I'm not
that guy anymore, so...

710
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,600
I'm sure. I understand
that a little prison time

711
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,300
totally transforms everyone.

712
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,500
Yeah, well, that's just it,
you know.

713
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,600
All the kids that were
in the juvenile detention center with me

714
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,000
had been in and out of there
a dozen times.

715
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Seeing that helped me realize
you get out the same way you get in--

716
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,200
on your own.
And so I straightened myself out.

717
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,300
Well, good for you.

718
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,600
Of course, it would
have been better

719
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,200
if you hadn't gotten in
in the first place.

720
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,100
You're absolutely right, ma'am.

721
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,800
Is there celery
in this potato salad?

722
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,400
Mm-hmm.

723
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,600
With a little bit
of sweet relish?

724
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,300
Yes, there is.

725
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,800
I thought Mom made
the best potato salad.

726
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,300
I think this got that beat.

727
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,200
( laughs )
It's my mother's recipe.

728
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,200
You mind if I steal it?

729
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,900
Oh, I thought you had
given up stealing.

730
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,300
Julie! Julie, wait.

731
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,500
That was bullshit,
you know that?

732
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,900
How are you gonna put
my business out there

733
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,500
- just to you could scare her?
- It was a joke.

734
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,600
Okay, well, you know what? I don't
like being the punchline of your joke.

735
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,700
What's with you anyway?
Why are you like this?

736
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,800
You didn't think twice
about leaving me out to dry

737
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,300
just so you can school her.

738
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,300
And you know what bothers me even more
than you playing me right now?

739
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,500
You're staring me with those
big, sexy eyes and, you know--

740
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
You want to kiss me.

741
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
Hell yeah, I want to kiss you.

742
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,800
Yeah.

743
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,200
¶ Do you understand ¶

744
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,200
¶ This might be
the perfect song ¶

745
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,600
¶ Something pure and new? ¶

746
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,400
¶ No more late-night ¶

747
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,700
¶ Television hours ¶

748
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,600
¶ Or sleepless mornings. ¶

749
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,900
You know I'm still
mad at you, right?

750
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

751
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,400
What's this?

752
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,400
Oh, hey, give me that.

753
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,800
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.

754
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,600
- What is it?
- Julie, give it back.

755
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,000
- Wait, what is that?
- Julie, seriously.

756
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,300
"Learn how to ride
a unicycle."

757
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,800
God damn it.
Come on.

758
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,700
"Become fluent
in the African clicking language.

759
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,100
Create the first gummy museum."

760
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,700
- Seriously, can you give it back to me?
- What the hell is this?

761
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,700
It's just a to-do list, okay?

762
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,900
You want to do all this stuff?
"Lose all my virginity."

763
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,200
- Screw you. Stop.
- It's getting too good right now.

764
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,800
"To die."
Oh, man.

765
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,700
"Get pureed in a jet engine.

766
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,500
Get run over by a back-up.

767
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,200
Skydive nude
with no parachute."

768
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,800
You want to do all this stuff too?
You can't do all this stuff.

769
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,400
Jerk, stop laughing at me.
The one serious thing in my life,

770
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,700
and you're laughing.

771
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,100
Greta, you want to kill
somebody?

772
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Just myself, okay?
Don't worry about it.

773
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,300
You need to stop
talking shit.

774
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,700
I'm not.

775
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm not talking shit.

776
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm not.

777
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,400
So why do you want
to kill yourself?

778
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,500
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard all day today,

779
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,300
and today has been
straight up retarded.

780
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,500
You know what I think's
retarded?

781
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,000
Wanting to own a restaurant.

782
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,900
Look, I've got one more year
of high school left,

783
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,300
and then what?

784
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,700
Be like my mother,

785
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,000
desperate for companionship?

786
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,900
Or my grandparents?
They're afraid of their own shadow.

787
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,000
They're prisoners
in their own little world.

788
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,400
So you get 16 years
of having a good time

789
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,400
and then 60
running away from death?

790
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,700
Not me.

791
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm gonna quit
while I'm ahead.

792
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,700
You have an extremely

793
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,200
extremely cynical look on life.

794
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
But you're so lucky.

795
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,700
And you're such a privileged
person, you know?

796
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,200
You should appreciate
what you got good.

797
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,800
That's what I'm doing.

798
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,600
I'm trying to appreciate

799
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,800
what I have good right now.

800
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,900
Hello.

801
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,100
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

802
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,100
Katherine: Do you think
it's a literary reference or what?

803
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,400
- Have you ever heard of that?
- No.

804
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,500
You guys look bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

805
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,500
All right, just don't.
Don't even.

806
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,300
You want some tea?

807
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,500
- No, thanks.
- Katherine: Thank you.

808
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,600
- How is that?
- It's still hot.

809
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,800
I'll say.

810
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,700
Greta, didn't anybody
ever teach you

811
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,500
not to barge into people's rooms
without knocking?

812
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,200
Well, I'm sorry.

813
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,600
I didn't realize
that you guys still do that.

814
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,000
Well, that's a very conventional
point of view, isn't it?

815
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,300
Looks like another
hot one today,

816
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,600
another hot and sweaty one.

817
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,100
That's funny.
I feel perfectly cool.

818
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,800
I know that you guys were
a little preoccupied last night,

819
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,500
but I came home on time.

820
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,800
Congratulations.

821
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,500
Of course, you could have told us
it was your day off.

822
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,100
Well, you could have let me know
it was your day to get off.

823
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,100
Oh, Greta, you just
don't stop, do you?

824
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,700
You just have to push it
as far as you can.

825
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,500
Well, I may not
know much, kiddo,

826
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,800
but I know when it's time
to get out of Dodge.

827
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,100
So where's that old hunk of junk
you've been working on?

828
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,400
You're looking at her.

829
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
No way.

830
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,700
Yeah, uh-huh.

831
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,500
That's pretty pimp.

832
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
What happened?

833
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,500
You know,
a little elbow grease,

834
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,800
a lot of love,
a lot of patience.

835
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,100
I think it's gonna be
worth the effort, though,

836
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,400
when your grandma sees it.

837
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,100
It's so dope,

838
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,600
definitely the best-looking boat
on the marina.

839
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,100
Thanks.

840
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,600
Didn't you just
have breakfast?

841
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah.

842
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,800
Where are we going?

843
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,600
We're not going anywhere today.
I've got a lot of work to do on this engine.

844
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
Fine by me.

845
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,900
I get seasick
watching "Gilligan's Island."

846
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,700
Greta, can I talk to you
for a minute?

847
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,500
Thanks to the Bill of Rights.

848
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,200
This morning your grandmother
found a pill in the toilet bowl,

849
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,700
a little white pill
just stuck there.

850
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,900
And?

851
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,400
You want to tell me
what that's all about?

852
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,800
I haven't spoken to your mother
about it yet,

853
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,400
but I think
I'm gonna have to.

854
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,700
What do you think it is-- Ex?

855
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,200
What?

856
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,700
It's Lexapro.

857
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,200
It's an SSRI,

858
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,600
which means that it's--

859
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,000
I forget what it means,

860
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,100
but it's supposed to make me
normal and boring.

861
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,900
Dr. Glickman put me on it

862
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,500
after I set Edgar's briefcase
on fire.

863
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,600
( chuckles )

864
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,900
What was it doing in the toilet?

865
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,300
I stopped taking it
months ago.

866
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,400
I don't feel right
when I'm on it, you know.

867
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,500
And plus, they say,
"Just say no,"

868
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,700
and then they turn around
and write you a prescription

869
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,400
for some mood-altering drug.
It's so stupid.

870
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,900
Yeah, but if he prescribed it,
maybe you should be taking it.

871
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,600
The only reason
he even wrote the scrip

872
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,700
is because Mom saw
an ad somewhere

873
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,400
and he does everything
that Mom tells him.

874
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,400
Your mother is just trying
to do what she thinks is best for you.

875
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,700
You know, she loves you.

876
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

877
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,300
Then why am I here?

878
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,600
She doesn't know
what do with you, Greta.

879
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,200
You know what?

880
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,200
If the house was on fire

881
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,700
and she could choose
to save me or Edgar,

882
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,700
I think that she'd choose Edgar.

883
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,700
I really think that.

884
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,600
Woman: Hey, Greta,
table 9 wants you.

885
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,400
Hey, remember us?

886
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,400
Yeah.
What do you want?

887
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,800
Well, we don't know. We thought
maybe you could help us decide.

888
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,400
We had a really good time
last time.

889
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,100
Yeah? What am l,
a goddamn sideshow?

890
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,500
What the hell do you want?

891
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,600
Excuse me.
Greta, could I see you?

892
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,100
Thank you.

893
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,500
Look, the attitude was cute
for a while,

894
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
but you gotta shape up.

895
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
Now I'm gonna put Donna
on that table,

896
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,000
so just take it easy, okay?

897
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

898
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,200
Can we go to the beach later?

899
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,500
Yeah, we can.

900
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,500
But you have to let go of me
so I don't burn anything, okay?

901
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,300
Can I get a refill?

902
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,400
Do I look anything
like your waitress?

903
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,300
Sit down, Greta.

904
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,200
I'm not trying to pick on you,

905
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,900
but you have to treat customers
like what they are.

906
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,000
Thumbtacks in my ass?

907
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,900
No, they're your employers.

908
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,000
They're my employers.
They pay our salaries.

909
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,200
All right.

910
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,500
Do you want to fire me?

911
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,700
You're an unusual girl.

912
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,600
You have more confidence

913
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,100
and self-assurance
than any adult I know.

914
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,500
You can go very far in life.

915
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,700
Except you have this way

916
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,800
of poking people in the eye
with your words.

917
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,900
You know what, Lou? I really
don't need this hassle tonight, okay?

918
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,700
I'm being very kind here.

919
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,800
Well, save your charity
for someone who wants it, okay?

920
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,100
If you don't want me working here,
then fire me.

921
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,000
Why don't you take
tomorrow night off?

922
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Maybe I will.

923
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I'll take tomorrow night off,
and the next night after that,

924
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,200
and the night after that,
and after that,

925
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,800
and after that,
and then after that one...

926
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,100
( continues ranting )

927
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
- Greta, wait.
- I quit.

928
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,400
- Let me just talk to Lou.
- Don't you dare.

929
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,600
I'm sick of wasting my time
in this lousy dump.

930
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,900
It's not that bad, okay?
I'm gonna go in there

931
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,300
and I gotta mop.
It should take 10 minutes. Stay.

932
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,700
No way.

933
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,300
You can meet me
at my house later.

934
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,600
What about your grandmother?

935
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,900
What about
my lousy grandmother?

936
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,600
¶ All I have ¶

937
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,800

All right.

954
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,400
Julie.

955
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,300
You told me to come over.

956
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,000
- Come on up.
- How am I supposed to get up there

957
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,100
without waking up your grandparents?
Come down here.

958
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,000
I can't.
I'm not dressed.

959
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,600
Climb up.

960
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,600
Hell no.
I ain't climbing up that.

961
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,900
I want to see you.
I want you to come up here.

962
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,100
Please please please
please please.

963
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,800
Look what you got me doing.

964
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,500
( dog yapping )

965
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,500
Shh.

966
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,500
Be careful.

967
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,100
- Hi.
- You're gonna make me kill myself.

968
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,100
¶ Time was sitting still ¶

969
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,000
¶ In a sleepy world ¶

970
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,000

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,000
¶ At your gate. ¶

976
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,400
What's this?

977
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,900
Well, you know, they are
these balloon thingies

978
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,200
- and two people use them--
- Yeah, I know what they are.

979
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,100
I didn't know what size to get,

980
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,600
so I got Magnums.

981
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,500
We're not about to use this.

982
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,100
Yes, we are.

983
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,100
I mean, it's not gonna be
that way.

984
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,900
We're not about to have sex.

985
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,900
What's wrong?

986
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,100
There's nothing wrong.

987
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,100
That's the problem.
See, I really like you

988
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,400
and I don't want to be one of those things
you check off your to-do list.

989
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,700
You know,
you can't control

990
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,000
every damn thing
that happens in your life.

991
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,600
Some things just gotta have
their own rhythm, you know?

992
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,000
You gotta go with that.

993
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,400
You know what I mean?

994
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,500
So you don't think
I'm gross or anything?

995
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,300
( chuckles ) No.

996
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,400
You're trouble for sure, yeah,

997
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,100
'cause you're hot
and you're sexy and you're smart.

998
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,000
( police radio chatter )

999
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
- Why are cops here?
- Shit.

1000
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Julie.

1001
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,400
Julie, wait.
Where are you going?

1002
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,700
- I gotta go.
- Julie.

1003
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,600
I gotta get out of here.

1004
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,300
What are you doing?
Julie, Julie.

1005
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,300
Hey, get out of there.

1006
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,700
Come on, get down.
On the ground. On the ground.

1007
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,200
I didn't do anything.

1008
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,800
Shit.

1009
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,000
Come on, junior.
Get up, get up.

1010
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,100
Just one second, man.
I didn't do nothing.

1011
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,900
- Wait wait, hold on, hold on.
- Easy now.

1012
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,400
Mrs. O'Donnell, you gotta tell them.
They made a mistake.

1013
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,900
What's going on here?

1014
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,000
A neighbor spotted this individual
climbing up your trellis, ma'am.

1015
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,400
- Ma'am, do you know this person?
- Yes, of course.

1016
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,300
I thought you were through
with stealing.

1017
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,300
I wasn't stealing anything.
It's a mix-up. They made a mistake.

1018
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,700
Leave him alone.

1019
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,100
Just one second, man.
I didn't do nothing.

1020
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Grams, tell them to stop, please.
He's gonna be in so much trouble.

1021
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,900
- What is he doing here?
- I invited him here.

1022
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,300
- To do what exactly?
- What's going on here?

1023
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,700
Gramps, please
make them stop.

1024
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,500
Okay, that's it. I've had it.
I'm calling your mother right now.

1025
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,900
You're insane.

1026
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,700
- Look, he didn't do anything.
- No, back inside.

1027
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,900
Joseph: Katherine, don't get Karen
all riled up.

1028
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,000
Gramps, they're gonna
take him in.

1029
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,700
- I've got to call her mother.
- You have to go tell them.

1030
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,100
He didn't do anything wrong.
I promise.

1031
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,200
- He crawled through my window.
- Shut up, Grams.

1032
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,100
- Don't talk to her that way.
- Please, it's not fair.

1033
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,100
You're not helping things.
Now listen to me.

1034
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Go upstairs
and let me deal with this.

1035
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,500
I will take care of this.
Yes yes, right now.

1036
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,100
I will take care of this.
I will deal with it. Go on, go on.

1037
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,800
Go on.

1038
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,100
Oh, that girl--
she is totally out of control.

1039
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I mean, just once
she's got to learn

1040
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,400
that she can't have everything
her own way.

1041
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,900
She's your family, Katherine.
She's your flesh and blood.

1042
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,500
She's not some enemy
you have to defeat.

1043
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,700
I apologize for all this,
Mr. O'Donnell.

1044
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,200
And I hope I didn't get Greta
in too much trouble.

1045
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,400
Thanks.

1046
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,800
And I think you got it backwards.
I think she's the one

1047
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,400
who got you in trouble.

1048
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,200
I like her, you know.
I really like Greta

1049
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:06,100
and she's worth it,

1050
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,800
but I'm worried about her,
you know?

1051
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,000
Does she ever talk to you about--?

1052
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
She's got that little notebook
she carries around.

1053
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,000
Do you--?

1054
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,000
Greta ever say anything to you
about her father?

1055
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,600
She doesn't talk too much
about personal stuff, you know.

1056
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,900
Well, it's something we don't
talk about very much in this family either,

1057
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,400
but I think you've earned the right
to know about it.

1058
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,700
Greta's father killed himself.

1059
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,500
She was just a little kid,

1060
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,400
five, six years old.

1061
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,100
He took his shotgun
and stuck it in his mouth.

1062
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,400
She was there.
She walked in on him.

1063
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,200
You know, I don't know

1064
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,200
how much of it
she remembers,

1065
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,700
how much
she carries around with her,

1066
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,800
but here she is,
all grown up,

1067
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,200
and writing that list.

1068
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,100
You know, it may be a phase
she's going through.

1069
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,600
It may be just some idea
that she has to reckon with,

1070
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,100
but I think--

1071
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,700
I think it's our job

1072
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,700
to try and help her
through it.

1073
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,100
Wow.

1074
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Yeah.

1075
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,300
Well, go on home.

1076
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,200
Get some sleep.

1077
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,600
Thank you, sir.

1078
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,900
- Hey, Julie.
- Yeah?

1079
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,500
Do you get seasick?

1080
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:52,400
¶ If life is like a mountain,
did you, did you not fall? ¶

1081
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,300
¶ I have missed you
since I was five ¶

1082
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,800
¶ I don't recall your eyes,
but your hands I do recall ¶

1083
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,600
¶ And I know how you smelled
when you were alive ¶

1084
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,400
¶ You've died ¶

1085
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,800
¶ Like we're all gonna go
someday ¶

1086
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
¶ You've died ¶

1087
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,200
¶ I was five
and I wish you'd stayed ¶

1088
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,200
¶ You've died ¶

1089
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,900
¶ I was five
and I wish you'd stayed. ¶

1090
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,500
Yeah, this is great.

1091
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,800
I feel all preppy and shit.

1092
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,100
Why are we here?

1093
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,600
Your grandfather's
a good guy, you know.

1094
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,300
This means a lot to him.

1095
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,300
Come on, it's not that bad,
though, right?

1096
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,300
Hey,

1097
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,500
remember that stuff

1098
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,500
that you said in my room
the other night?

1099
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,600
Yeah, I remember.

1100
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,700
Did you mean that?

1101
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,400
Have I lied to you yet?

1102
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,600
I don't know.

1103
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,300
Hey, Julie,
want to take the helm?

1104
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,100
Go ahead.

1105
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,400
All right, I'm coming.

1106
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,800
Just keep her
in a straight line.

1107
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,100
Katherine: I love it.
It's wonderful.

1108
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,900
¶ Come with me ¶

1109
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:05,300
¶ Come with me ¶

1110
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,000
¶ On a voyage ¶

1111
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,400
¶ To the bottom ¶

1112
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,800
¶ Of the sea ¶

1113
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,500
¶ In a sea ¶

1114
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,800
¶ Of blue-green ¶

1115
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,600
¶ We will find love ¶

1116
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,900
¶ At the bottom ¶

1117
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,500
¶ Of the sea ¶

1118
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,800
¶ Unbelievable, inconceivable ¶

1119
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,300
¶ Fantastic it will seem ¶

1120
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,500
¶ But we'll be the first ¶

1121
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,700
¶ The very first ¶

1122
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,700
¶ To live such a strange
new dream ¶

1123
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,100
¶ Come with me.¶

1124
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,200
Greta.

1125
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,500
Greta.

1126
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,100
There they are.

1127
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
Greta.

1128
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,000
I've got you.
I've got you.

1129
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,200
Okay, right there, right there.

1130
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,500
Are you all right?

1131
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,400
Yeah. Are you okay?

1132
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,300
- Are you okay, honey?
- My head.

1133
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,800
You hit your head?
Let me see it.

1134
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,600
Turn it.

1135
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,700
Joseph: It's not bleeding.

1136
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,300
Grams.

1137
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,800
Grams.

1138
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,200
Katherine, Katherine.

1139
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,500
Are you all right?

1140
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,000
- Grams.
- I'm gonna get on the radio.

1141
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,300
Grams, hey.

1142
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,500
( P.A. chatter )

1143
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,900
It was a mild heart attack.
She's okay.

1144
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,200
She's gonna have to be
on medication from now on, though.

1145
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,100
But she's okay.
They want to keep her here tonight

1146
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,800
and run some more tests.

1147
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,200
I'm gonna stay with her
until she goes to sleep.

1148
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,000
You two go on home,

1149
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,300
get out of this
air conditioning.

1150
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,400
( thunder rumbling )

1151
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,400
Hey, here.

1152
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,300
You're not gonna stay?

1153
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:50,800
No, you can check me off
that list of yours.

1154
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
I'm done.

1155
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,800
What?

1156
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,100
What are you talking about?

1157
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,500
Are you serious?

1158
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,000
You really don't get it?

1159
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,400
Reggie Spiegel,

1160
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,300
my roommate in juvie.

1161
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,600
One morning, Mother's Day...

1162
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,500
I found him hanging
by an electric cord.

1163
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,900
I didn't see it coming
'cause he didn't mouth off about it.

1164
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,200
He didn't want to be saved.

1165
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,200
See, you knew I'd jump in
after you

1166
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,700
'cause you didn't want to die.

1167
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,700
You just wanted that drama.

1168
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,500
- No, l--
- What you did was serious.

1169
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,800
And it affects people.

1170
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,300
It affects me.

1171
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,300
I wish I could help you,
'cause you need it.

1172
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,600
But I'm not going
overboard for you.

1173
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,900
I got my own shit.
I'm doing my own thing.

1174
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,300
You know?

1175
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,100
"April 10th, 1962.

1176
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,200
My sweet sweet Joseph,

1177
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,000
you set sail
less than an hour ago

1178
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,400
and I'm kicking myself already.

1179
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,800
Please forgive me.

1180
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,100
I only treated you that way

1181
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,900
because I was mad
about you leaving.

1182
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,800
I've been silly,

1183
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:24,000
prone to capriciousness.

1184
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,300
I'm mad at myself

1185
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,100
for wasting our last
moments together,

1186
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,500
for not telling you

1187
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,700
how I really feel.

1188
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,300
I love you

1189
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:41,600
and I've missed my chance
to tell you in person.

1190
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,100
If something happens to you,
I'll just die.

1191
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,000
I miss you, Joseph.

1192
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,900
Promise you'll come home safely.

1193
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,200
Forever yours, Katherine."

1194
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,300
Grams.

1195
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,600
( tinkling )

1196
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,900
Okay, close your eyes.

1197
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,300
Katherine: Can I trust you?

1198
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,300
Okay, this way.

1199
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Can I open my eyes yet?

1200
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,100
Mm, okay.

1201
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:25,000
Oh, you didn't have to
do that, Greta.

1202
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,000
Those flowers
are expensive.

1203
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,500
Can't you see that I'm trying
to say I'm sorry?

1204
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,100
Well, then say it.

1205
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,900
I just did.

1206
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,500
No.

1207
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,400
You don't even know
what you're sorry for.

1208
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,200
I'm fighting to save my life

1209
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,400
and you're trying
to throw yours away.

1210
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,200
Now why is that?

1211
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,900
'Cause...

1212
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,400
I want to be
like the girl in this picture,

1213
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,700
young and alive.

1214
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,100
I haven't seen this picture since--

1215
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,900
I wasn't any older
than you there.

1216
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,000
You look like a totally
different person,

1217
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,800
so happy.
Don't you miss that?

1218
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,500
Well, no.

1219
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,500
You're telling me
that you wouldn't jump at the chance

1220
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,400
if you could turn
the clock back?

1221
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,200
( chuckles ) No.

1222
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,700
I wouldn't.

1223
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,000
You see...

1224
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,000
I was a different person then.

1225
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,600
I didn't know anything
about the world or myself.

1226
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,900
I had no perspective.

1227
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,800
This was a long time ago.

1228
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,100
And every day since then,

1229
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,600
every experience I've had,

1230
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,200
every person I've met

1231
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:05,700
has carved an impression on me.

1232
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,800
You know, this girl, this child--

1233
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,700
she's just a fraction
of what I've become--

1234
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,300
a wife, a mother,
a grandmother--

1235
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,700
me.

1236
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,100
Oh, honey,
you have no idea

1237
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,200
what's ahead of you.

1238
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:27,100
It's all such an incredible
adventure.

1239
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,300
Do you have a picture of my dad?

1240
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,700
I just want to know
what he looks like.

1241
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,800
You've never seen
a picture of your father?

1242
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,600
No.

1243
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,900
Sweetheart.

1244
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,900
( horn honks )

1245
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,400
What are they doing here?

1246
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,400
Mom.

1247
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,700
Hiya, all.

1248
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,100
Are you okay?

1249
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,800
Shouldn't you be
sitting down or something?

1250
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,700
- I'm fine, dear. Hello.
- I'm so sorry.

1251
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,200
What are you doing here?

1252
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,300
Gramps, what are they
doing here?

1253
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,500
Greta, go inside
and get your things.

1254
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,000
I don't want to go home
with you.

1255
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,800
We're not taking you
home, Greta.

1256
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,900
Then why are you he--?

1257
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,900
You're gonna send me
to that boot camp.

1258
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,700
Go get your things, Greta.

1259
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,100
Wait a minute.
What's this boot camp stuff?

1260
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,700
No, it's a special
summer camp

1261
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,200
for kids like her,

1262
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,800
to straighten her out.

1263
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,000
Gramps, why didn't you tell me
that they were coming?

1264
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,000
I asked your grandfather
not to say anything.

1265
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,000
We didn't want you
running off or something.

1266
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,700
- Greta.
- Edgar: Come on now.

1267
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,600
Karen: Greta.

1268
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:08,200
My mom is here.

1269
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,400
She's gonna send me away
to some boot camp place.

1270
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,300
What am I gonna do?

1271
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,600
What can you do?

1272
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,000
There's got to be something.

1273
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I guess you could
check the camp out,

1274
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,400
see what it's all about.

1275
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,200
You think I'm screwed up
and that place is gonna save me?

1276
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,700
Yeah, you're screwed up.

1277
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,700
But that place can't fix you.

1278
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,300
Only you can fix you.

1279
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,300
If that's not what you want,
it ain't gonna happen.

1280
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,700
I'm really sorry.

1281
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,100
Well, that's a start.

1282
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,300
- You smell like food.
- Yeah.

1283
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,300
Yeah.

1284
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,100
Call me when you get it all
figured out, okay?

1285
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,100
All right.

1286
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,000
Have a nice walk?

1287
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,500
Did Mom leave?

1288
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,800
She's here now,
so come on back.

1289
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,800
You all finished
with your little tantrum?

1290
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,300
What are you doing
with my stuff?

1291
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,500
I packed your things.
You've wasted enough time already.

1292
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,900
I don't want to go.
Please, please let me stay.

1293
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,900
Your grandmother
does not want you here.

1294
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,800
- That's not true.
- That's what you told me last week.

1295
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,900
"There's no winning with her,"
you said.

1296
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,300
Did I say that?

1297
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,900
Well, that was then
and this is now.

1298
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,300
And if Greta wants to stay,
I would quite like to have her.

1299
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,700
- I'm staying.
- No, you're not.

1300
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,400
- Mom.
- Shh.

1301
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,000
- Greta, let go.
- Be careful there. Be careful.

1302
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,200
Mom.

1303
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,400
- Quiet down and give me the bag.
- What's wrong with you?

1304
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,000
- Greta, stop it.
- Edgar: What's going on?

1305
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,600
- Mom, please.
- Stop making a scene.

1306
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,300
- Edgar: What are you doing?
- Edgar, I could use some help.

1307
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,300
- Be careful. Don't hurt her.
- Come on now.

1308
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,400
Mrs. Wocheski: What the hell
is going on over there?

1309
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,800
All right, just stop.
Everybody just stop.

1310
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,200
( blaring )

1311
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:33,200
Greta, get up.

1312
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,500
Please, Katherine, sit down.

1313
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,500
I'm sick of all this.

1314
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,700
I'm tired of all this screaming
and yelling and fighting

1315
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,600
and the police on my porch
in the middle of the night

1316
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,500
and my wife upset
every 15 minutes.

1317
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,700
I don't want to hear
another word

1318
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,200
about this boot camp nonsense.

1319
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,000
Dad, look,
with all due respect,

1320
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,000
you really don't have
any say here.

1321
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,300
Oh, yes, I do.

1322
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,500
I earned it when you
dumped her on us this summer.

1323
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:00,000
This kid needs love
and understanding and patience.

1324
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,100
Do you hear yourself?

1325
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,600
Where was the love and understanding
when I needed it,

1326
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,400
when you let her
run me out of the house

1327
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:10,100
because she didn't like
my boyfriend?

1328
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,900
What? I never threw you
out of this house.

1329
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,200
I simply said you couldn't live here
and do drugs.

1330
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,100
You two have a lot of nerve

1331
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,500
bringing my parenting skills
into question.

1332
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,900
Stop it.
Mom, stop talking to them like that.

1333
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,300
Okay, I will go
to the stupid boot camp.

1334
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,600
- No, Greta, Greta.
- Wait wait.

1335
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,300
- Greta's staying here.
- Dad.

1336
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,600
- And so are you.
- No, I'm not.

1337
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,800
We're gonna make this right.
We're gonna fix it.

1338
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,100
We're gonna get to know
one another, this family of ours.

1339
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,100
Dad, I have a job.

1340
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,100
Well, you've got vacation time
saved up, haven't you?

1341
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:46,100
Well, yeah, but that's for Bermuda
in the fall.

1342
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,700
Oh, you're taking your daughter
to Bermuda in the fall, are you?

1343
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,600
No, just Edgar and l.

1344
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,700
Uh-huh.

1345
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,600
No, you cannot make Edgar
spend his vacation here.

1346
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,000
Edgar isn't invited.

1347
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,300
This is between us and you
and Greta.

1348
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,700
And if Edgar really loves you,
he can just do without you for a little while

1349
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,100
while you save
your daughter's life.

1350
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,800
When you put it like that,
I have to say--

1351
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,000
- You're not gonna leave me here?
- Yeah.

1352
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,500
You're leaving me here?

1353
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,400
Yeah, this is the best idea
any of us have had.

1354
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,800
You know, I think your dad is right.
This could be good for everyone.

1355
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,000
- Edgar.
- See you in a couple of weeks.

1356
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,500
- Edgar.
- You'll be fine, sweetheart.

1357
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,700
Oh, this is grand.

1358
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,900
Oh, this is gonna really
be helpful.

1359
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,800
Go on, you two, yuck it up.

1360
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,300
I don't even have
any clothes to wear.

1361
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,500
Grandma's got some dresses
you could wear.

1362
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,700
- Edgar: Bye, all.
- You two are exactly alike.

1363
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,500
And you--

1364
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,100
Here.

1365
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,500
Here he is.

1366
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,400
Oh, yeah, there he is.

1367
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,300
He was handsome.

1368
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,900
I dream about him sometimes,

1369
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,300
but he never looks the same.

1370
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,300
You have his eyes.

1371
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,000
Yeah?

1372
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,900
And his brains.

1373
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,800
Well, I'll try to keep mine
inside my skull.

1374
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,400
I always loved
that picture of you.

1375
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,400
God.

1376
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,000
Oh my God.

1377
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,300
What happened to your hair, Mom?

1378
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,100
The 1980s.

1379
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It's huge.

1380
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,900
Katherine:
Big hair. Big hair.

Greta: Dear Mom,

1385
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,300
I'll probably be home
by the time you get this,

1386
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,600
but I don't care.

1387
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,100
I just wanted to thank you
for the time we had together

1388
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,400
and for letting me
stay down here.

01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:37,500
¶ This world is a warm,
sunny park ¶

1398
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,600
¶ Nice day for a talk
with your girl ¶

1399
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:04,300
¶ Nice day for your shop
to get busy ¶

1400
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:11,300
¶ This world is
of no empty part ¶

1401
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:31,200
¶ Please don't ask me
all those questions ¶

1402
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
¶ I don't know ¶

1403
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,300
¶ Please don't ask me
all those questions ¶

1404
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,800
¶ I don't know ¶

1405
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:43,300
¶ And when you wake up early
and the sun is shining ¶

1406
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:47,800
¶ Are you ready for
the day that's coming? ¶

1407
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,200
¶ It's coming ¶

1408
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,200
¶ Yeah. ¶
