1
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,633
Go, go, go, go!
Move it, move it!

2
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,761
Move it! Let's go!

3
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,558
Move, move! In the car!
Let's go.

4
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,352
Let's go!

5
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,188
There's 4 of you.

6
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,064
You can count.
I'm impressed. Now drive.

7
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,066
Rule one...
Never change the deal.

8
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,401
The deal was
transportation...

9
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,736
for 3 men
with a combined weight...

10
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,321
of 254 kilos.

11
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,823
Yeah? Well,
this is a new deal.

12
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,075
An extra 80 kilos
means we'll not make...

13
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,994
your destination on
the gas I have allotted.

14
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,579
So we'll stop
and get more gas!

15
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,872
Every stop we make
exposes us.

16
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,915
Every exposure...

17
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,750
increases the risk
of getting caught.

18
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,419
An extra 80 kilos means
the Koni shock absorbers...

19
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,213
I installed for this job
will not give us...

20
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,255
the ability
to outmaneuver...

21
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,382
any police that might
be chasing us.

22
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,010
Which means,
if there is a chase...

23
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,429
we lose our advantage,
which also increases...

24
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,931
the possibility
of getting caught.

25
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,058
I don't want
to get caught.

26
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,559
You don't want
to get caught.

27
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,019
Just drive the car, man...

28
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,437
or you're gonna catch
a bullet through the brains!

29
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,688
And who's going
to drive?

30
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,190
Shoot this asshole!
I'll drive.

31
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,317
Not without the ignition
code you won't.

32
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,618
3 men. 254 kilos.

33
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,662
That was the deal.

34
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,332
Argh!

35
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,922
3 men, 254 kilos.

36
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,966
Seat belts.

37
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,217
Argh!

38
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,014
Shit!

39
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,391
Shit!

40
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,969
See what I mean
about the shocks?

41
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,059
Now it's time.

42
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,610
Cop:
Move it, Marcel, move it!

43
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,821
Look out!
Get out of the road!

44
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,368
One way, one way!

45
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,329
We're going
the wrong way!

46
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,914
Stop it,
Marcel, stop!

47
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,417
Move away!

48
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,005
Look out, look out!

49
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,632
Whoa!

50
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,550
Whoo-hoo!

51
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,150
Yes!

52
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,528
Go, go, go!

53
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,570
Merde!

54
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,043
Oh... shit!

55
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,617
If you don't mind...

56
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,952
I just conditioned
the leather back there.

57
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,540
Take us to the drop point!

58
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,749
Not yet.

59
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,264
Aah!

60
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:55,976
Hello.

61
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,103
The cops, the cops!

62
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,605
What are you doing?
Don't stop now!

63
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,148
Thug 1: Do something!
Come on, do something!

64
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,233
What are you thinking?

65
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,184
Your gun, please.

66
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,321
Police! Stop!

67
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,115
Stop! Police!

68
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,497
I'm fed up with this car chase!

69
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,732
You gave me too much.

70
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,860
We need you to take us to Avignon.

71
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,614
The deal was this far
and no further.

72
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,241
The deal is the deal.
Rule number one.

73
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,284
Rules are meant to be broken.

74
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,744
Not mine.

75
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:25,459
Let's go. Get in the car.

76
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,377
Come on! Quick!

77
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,255
Move it!

78
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,800
Man 1 On TV:
Really I did.

79
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,343
Man On TV 2:
Oh, yeah, well, how come...

80
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,678
you don't have your
yellow card with you?

81
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,304
Well, I... I...

82
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,014
must've left it
back in Nam on the base.

83
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,516
Yeah, they all say that.

84
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,976
"Left it back in Nam
on the base." Uh-huh.

85
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,644
Let me show you
what we do to people...

86
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,104
who left it back in Nam
on the base.

87
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,522
Oh, no!
Please let go of me!

88
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,773
Where are you taking me?

89
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,650
You gotta be punished
for not carrying...

90
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,777
your shot record on you.
It's a fate far worse than death.

91
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,452
Newscaster: The Argentinian
government reaffirmed...

92
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,537
its commitment to meeting...

93
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,248
the I.M.F's target
this year.

94
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,333
And yesterday, in Nice...

95
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,878
4 men robbed the Alliance
Investment Corporation.

96
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,338
One man died
on the sidewalk.

97
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,216
The others were apprehended
early this morning...

98
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,219
when they took a wrong turn
on a one-way street...

99
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,680
in Avignon and ran into
a taxi cab.

100
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,723
The police said...

101
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,308
were it not for their
poor driving habits...

102
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,476
the 20 million euros
in bearer bonds...

103
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,646
would have been cashed
and gone by this afternoon.

104
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,607
And in other news...

105
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,613
I always say the way
a man treats his car...

106
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,699
is how he treats himself.

107
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,409
I'd say that's probably true,
Inspector.

108
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,245
Heh heh heh!
You have a good sense of humor...

109
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,039
for a foreigner,
Monsieur Frank.

110
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,500
Like the French.
Sly wit.

111
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,919
Just the right amount
of flavor.

112
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,253
Been out driving?

113
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,506
Until they pass a law
that says I can't.

114
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,174
You want to come in
for a coffee?

115
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,717
Uh, thank you...

116
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,802
but I have a lot
of stops to make.

117
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,387
88 to be exact.

118
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,848
That's a lot of stops.

119
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:49,269
A lot of 1999
black BMW 765s...

120
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,898
with 06 in the license
plates to check out.

121
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,650
Oh, it's a very
popular car...

122
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,610
with a certain type
down here.

123
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,111
You've seen them.

124
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,530
They come over from Italy...

125
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,406
in those very expensive suits...

126
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,574
and the young pretty girls...

127
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,410
with the big jewelry
and too much make-up.

128
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,455
Very... Mafia.

129
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,290
There was a robbery.

130
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,542
A getaway.

131
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,295
Some very fancy driving.

132
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,758
By someone in a 1999
black BMW 735?

133
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,844
With 06 on the plate.

134
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,556
You have been
in the city lately?

135
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,266
Not for a while.

136
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,185
I love Nice.
The food...

137
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,645
the way they grill fish.

138
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,814
No place else in France does it...

139
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,023
the way they do in Nice.

140
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,942
And the women...

141
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,903
I prefer the women there.

142
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,657
They are more...
complicated...

143
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,034
than the local variety.

144
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,121
Don't you think?

145
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,582
I don't particularly
like complicated.

146
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,250
You like to keep it simple.

147
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,793
Why are you so interested?

148
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,795
Oh, you know, uh...

149
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,380
ever since
I'm a little boy...

150
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,674
military people
have always intrigued me.

151
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,634
I'm ex-military.

152
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,554
I'm an ex-little boy.

153
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,520
Sure you don't have time
for a coffee?

154
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,898
Everything is always...

155
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,317
so neat with you,
Monsieur Frank.

156
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,613
Nothing ever out of place.

157
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,198
I'll take that as a compliment...

158
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:27,743
coming from a man who pays
attention to every detail.

159
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,164
Maybe I'll come back
later for that coffee.

160
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,834
Door's always open to you.

161
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,628
Hmph.

162
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,424
Unh. Ahh.

163
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,224
Man On Phone:
Lupo gave me your number.

164
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,350
Be brief.

165
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,559
I'm looking for a transporter.

166
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,894
I'm listening.

167
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,147
Are you ready?

168
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,482
Are you ready...

169
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,527
One bag, that's it.

170
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:02,819
Dimensions.

171
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,156
Be specific.

172
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,200
One meter fifty
by half meter.

173
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,159
Weight?

174
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,328
50 kilos, not more.

175
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,041
Destination?

176
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,209
24 Rue de Luxembourg.

177
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,002
You're delivering to Mister...

178
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,088
Rule 2... No names.

179
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,217
Time of pickup?

180
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,846
7:00 in the morning
at the front door.

181
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,141
A package,
one meter fifty by fifty...

182
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,435
50 kilos,
250 kilometers...

183
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,603
travelling within
the speed limit...

184
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,980
one stop for refreshments...

185
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,898
40,000.

186
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,525
Half now, half on delivery.

187
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,360
Delivery will be at noon.

188
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,779
If no one's there,
it is not my responsibility.

189
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,614
I'll leave the package.
Once we make a deal...

190
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,157
the terms of that deal
cannot be changed...

191
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,325
or renegotiated.

192
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,451
Another rule?

193
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,954
It's rule number one.

194
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,289
Do we have a deal?

195
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,130
You're very precise.

196
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,841
Transportation is
a precise business.

197
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,404
Flat.

198
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,880
Hi.

199
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,512
Now, don't move.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

200
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,138
I'm just gonna
make a little hole...

201
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,640
so you can drink.
That's all I'm gonna do.

202
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,975
Please... please!
Please, come on.

203
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,117
Come on, drink.

204
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,496
Slowly.

205
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,133
OK, OK, that's enough.

206
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,844
Good girl.

207
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,470
I'm going to take
the tape off.

208
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,013
If you scream,
I'll have to kill you.

209
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,933
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,101
Aah! I have to pee!

211
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,563
You want me to do it
in your car?

212
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,400
OK.

213
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,528
Mmph!

214
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:26,829
I'm gonna take my knife out...

215
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,873
so don't scream, OK?
It's to cut you free.

216
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,629
You don't need
your mouth to pee.

217
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,638
You have one minute.

218
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,853
55... 54...

219
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:54,648
53... 52...

220
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,739
You're breaking
the rules, Frank.

221
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,658
Not good to break the rules.

222
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,043
15...

223
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,215
7...

224
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,970
2...

225
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,930
Time's up.

226
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,393
Don't make me drag you out.

227
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,741
Shit!

228
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,935
Aah!

229
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,619
Aah!

230
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,621
No, please! Nnn!

231
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,375
Rule 3...
Never look in the package.

232
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,460
Hope you enjoyed your pee...

233
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,629
because it's your
last on this trip.

234
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:59,690
Aah!

235
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,787
See what comes
of breaking the rules?

236
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,713
Yeah, yeah

237
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:29,136
My music, my life,
my heart, my soul...

238
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,013
Woman:
Jerk!

239
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,599
My wife, my daughter,
my love, my dream

240
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:36,268
My mother, my father,
my brother, my team

241
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,146
My camp, my squad,
my house, my car

242
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,982
My boat, my shoes,
my pants, my shirt

243
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,776
My coke, my sugar,
my cream, my butter

244
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:47,863
My toast, my all
my queen, my folks

245
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,908
My baby
walk like 6 strings tall

246
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:55,579
Talk like she's my everything

247
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,663
You're late.

248
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,291
Ran into a little problem.

249
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,710
Nothing serious?

250
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,965
Nothing serious.

251
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,813
You open the package?

252
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:24,942
Rule 3...
Never open the package.

253
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,277
Ha! I like that.

254
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,488
Rules.

255
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:33,033
You can't get anything done
in the world without rules.

256
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,952
You're a foreigner, right?

257
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,036
This is a nice little thing...

258
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,663
you've got going
for yourself here.

259
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:42,000
High class,
good reputation.

260
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,252
I didn't get your name.

261
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,921
Rule 2... No names.

262
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,965
Of course.

263
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,479
You don't count it?

264
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,357
Why? Should I?

265
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,859
No, no.

266
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,652
That concludes the deal.

267
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,411
You know,
I was wondering...

268
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:18,871
if you wouldn't mind...

269
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:21,248
transporting something for me.

270
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,333
That's what you do, right?

271
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,919
You deliver,
no questions asked.

272
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:30,757
Why not?

273
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,426
Mmm!

274
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:37,306
Weight?

275
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:41,018
Oh, maybe a kilo.

276
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,436
Destination?

277
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,606
Grenoble, 306 Rue du Lac...

278
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,191
a Mister...

279
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:50,235
Oh, right. I forgot.

280
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,445
Rule 2.

281
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,381
Heh heh heh!

282
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,175
I like him.

283
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,563
Thug:
What the fuck?!

284
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,284
Come on!

285
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,419
Oh!

286
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:13,629
Aah!

287
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,179
Where is he?

288
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,683
Aah!

289
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:03,720
Uhh!

290
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,072
Uhh!

291
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,366
Mm!

292
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:51,286
You're like dog shit!
You're everywhere.

293
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,080
Yeah.

294
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:54,289
I know, you wanna pee.

295
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,250
All you wanna do is pee.

296
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,677
Shit.

297
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:16,687
I got love

298
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,772

My homies

00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,234
Play no game

301
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,777
Play no games

302
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:26,155
Frank, you stupid shit.

303
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,531
I got love

304
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:29,116

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,828
I got love

307
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:35,038
Love for the ghetto,

308
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:36,373
If you was down before

309
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,209
You gon' still

310
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:42,421
I got game 'cause
the game was given to me

311
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:56,203
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

312
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:58,330
No long speeches.
Just keep it simple.

313
00:33:58,413 --> 00:33:59,540
Got it?

314
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,545
Who are you?

315
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,630
My name is Lai.
I come from Chi...

316
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,215
Uhh!

317
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:11,260
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

318
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,970
Nothing more.
Nothing less.

319
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,389
You want to try again?

320
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,853
What kind of shit am I in?

321
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,313
Deep shit.
Very deep shit.

322
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,357
Those guys...
Sorry! Sorry!

323
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:26,692
I won't say any...
Mm!

324
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,932
Bon Appetit.

325
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,559
Where are you going?

326
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,020
To bed.

327
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,188
I can't think straight
when I'm tired.

328
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,397
After a good night's sleep...

329
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,857
I always see things better.

330
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,025
Can I leave?

331
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,484
Be my guest.

332
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:40,474
Aah!

333
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:07,019
Hey...

334
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:09,730
are you comfortable?

335
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,398
- Boss...
- Shh.

336
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:12,524
Save your strength.

337
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,236
Just tell me, who did this?

338
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:19,072
The transporter.

339
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,159
The transporter's dead.

340
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:24,161
He's not.

341
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,168
Believe me.

342
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,047
I believe you.

343
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:39,426
And the police?
They were here?

344
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,886
No.

345
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,554
You told them nothing, right?

346
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:44,556
Right.

347
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,184
Of course...

348
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,896
you couldn't talk.

349
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,773
Yeah.

350
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:59,071
Let's keep it that way.

351
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,841
I picked them
from the garden outside.

352
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:03,844
I hope you don't mind.

353
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,847
I didn't know
if you like coffee...

354
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,473
or tea,
so I made both.

355
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,198
I hope you like, uh...

356
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,783
"Ma-de-leine."

357
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,869
Try one.

358
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:33,373
Careful.

359
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,666
It's hot.

360
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:39,046
Good?

361
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,553
Let me.

362
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,182
I like it quiet in the morning.

363
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,309
Yes.
Quiet in the morning.

364
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:53,727
Me, too.
Me, too.

365
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,439
I'm the same way.
I like very quiet.

366
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:01,443
Sorry.

367
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:08,951
Are you looking for milk?

368
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,496
There's milk at the door.

369
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,832
Stay, stay.
I'll go.

370
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,380
Hi.

371
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:25,759
And you are?

372
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:28,011
The new cook.

373
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:30,556
Is Monsieur Frank in?

374
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,892
Ah! Monsieur Frank.

375
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:37,062
Is your invitation
for coffee still open?

376
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,772
Sure, come on.
Please, sit.

377
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,401
Madeleine?

378
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,402
Homemade?

379
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:44,778
Lai:
Yes.

380
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,613
I'll bring some more.

381
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:47,739
Ah.

382
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:49,700
My mother used to make...

383
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:51,076
fresh Madeleines every morning.

384
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,287
I smell them
and my whole childhood...

385
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:55,414
comes back in one big flood...

386
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,166
like Proust.

387
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,917
You ever read Proust,
Monsieur Frank?

388
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,460
No.

389
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:01,753
Ah. He's fantastic.

390
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,755
Memory like a steel trap.

391
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,382
He would have been a great cop.

392
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,466
A real detail man.

393
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,093
- Milk?
- Please. Mmm.

394
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:13,098
Thank you.
Ahh.

395
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,601
Tarconi:
I used to have a memory like Proust.

396
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,811
Like a filing cabinet up there.

397
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:20,439
I would see something
and remember it like that.

398
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,065
Like, uh, license plates.

399
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:25,152
I could see a plate
and it was printed in my head.

400
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,112
Now I need all
the help I can get...

401
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,780
remembering whose plate...

402
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:30,282
goes with whose car.

403
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:33,410
Like, uh, this one.

404
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:36,663
It's mine.

405
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:39,041
Ah, memories.

406
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,334
Frank:
So?

407
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,585
Where's the rest
of the car?

408
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,587
I was hoping
you could tell me.

409
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,172
- It was stolen.
- Stolen?

410
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,299
Yeah, I went down to Frejus
to pick up a few things.

411
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:48,800
When I came out
of the market, it was...

412
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,803
Gone.
Did you report it?

413
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:54,973
It's the first on my list
of things to do today.

414
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:55,974
It's a long walk
from Frejus.

415
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,017
How did you get home?

416
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,310
Well...

417
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:00,854
I brought him.

418
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:03,315
I saw him walking
along the dark road.

419
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,400
Mm, a risky thing.

420
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:07,820
Picking up a stranger
on a dark road.

421
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,823
He had a kind face.

422
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,078
I didn't see
a car outside.

423
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:17,329
It's in the garage.

424
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:18,330
May I see it?

425
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:19,706
Mm-hmm.

426
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,688
Pretty nice car
for a cook.

427
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,734
Some people have a problem
with the Germans.

428
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,986
They're too aggressive.

429
00:42:49,111 --> 00:42:51,405
They take up
the best beaches in summer.

430
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:53,532
They can't cook worth a damn.

431
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,871
I say anyone
who makes such great cars...

432
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:01,665
can't be all bad.

433
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,417
I would say your intuition
worked out very well...

434
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:04,501
for Monsieur Frank,
mademoiselle.

435
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,881
Worked out for both of us.

436
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,262
Bon.

437
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:17,598
My intuition says
this is probably a good time...

438
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:20,100
for me to go
file my report.

439
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:21,685
Where's the rest
of my car?

440
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,061
Oh, yes.

441
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:24,646
I almost forgot.

442
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,982
It was blown to pieces
at a rest stop.

443
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:31,278
What's left of it
is down at the lab.

444
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:33,822
They're trying to separate
what was left...

445
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,908
of the 2 cops in the trunk...

446
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:38,076
from the rest of it.

447
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:40,996
But, uh, you wouldn't know
anything about that?

448
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,789
No.

449
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:44,291
Sorry to interrupt.

450
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,960
Thank you for the coffee
and the memories.

451
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:48,795
Come back any time.

452
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,797
Would you mind walking me?

453
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,633
Come on.

454
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,218
You have always
been very quiet...

455
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:56,136
about your business,
Monsieur Frank.

456
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:59,097
I appreciate that.
Less work for Mother.

457
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:00,974
But this business
at the rest stop.

458
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:03,268
That is not very quiet.

459
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,020
I don't suppose you
would like to tell me...

460
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,523
something besides
a stolen car story?

461
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,358
If I had one I would.

462
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:12,277
Well, may I suggest
that when the 2 of you...

463
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:14,154
show up in my office
after lunch...

464
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:15,823
you do have one.

465
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:18,450
A better one
than you currently have.

466
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,459
You are the one
he wants to see...

467
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:28,460
not me!

468
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:30,003
Quiet!

469
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,130
Please, I have to think.

470
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,174
You were supposed
to think last night.

471
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:36,677
Yeah, well,
last night I had nightmares...

472
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,805
about a girl who came
into my nice, quiet life...

473
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:41,348
screwed it all up.

474
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:42,558
Everything she touched broke...

475
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:44,518
and every move she made
turned into a catastrophe.

476
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:46,854
OK. Sorry.

477
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:51,608
I'm still wondering
if I want to know everything...

478
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,819
or nothing about you.

479
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:03,912
What?

480
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:05,414
The quiet.

481
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,791
I thought you liked quiet.

482
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:13,589
Yeah, not this quiet.

483
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:17,509
Aah!

484
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:34,318
You OK?

485
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:35,319
No!

486
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:36,695
Good. Let's go.

487
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,240
Uhh!

488
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:43,702
Aah!

489
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:47,539
Go! Go! Go!

490
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:54,880
Uhh!

491
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,886
- Aah!
- Aah!

492
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:02,012
No, don't stay there!

493
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,222
No!

494
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,099
Aah!

495
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:13,857
Aah! Aah!

496
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,334
Frank!

497
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:35,671
Come on,
give me your hand!

498
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:40,926
Aah!

499
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:49,643
Uhh!

500
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:51,979
Aah!

501
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,363
- Aah!
- Come on!

502
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:05,117
Come on, get in!
Get in!

503
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,077
- No! No!
- Get in!

504
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:13,000
Lai, look!
Come on, you wanna die?!

505
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,334
Get in!

506
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,485
Calm down, OK?

507
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:41,862
Don't worry.
You OK?

508
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,239
Stay here.
I'm coming back.

509
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,658
No, wait! Wait!

510
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:52,998
Uhh!

511
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,878
Aah!

512
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,507
Put it on.

513
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,344
- You OK?
- Mm.

514
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:06,887
Sure?

515
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,555
OK, let's go.

516
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,115
Frank?

517
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,992
Is this your house?

518
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:56,788
Lai:
Frank?

519
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:58,749
Uhh! Yeah, guess.

520
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:03,670
Frank.

521
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:12,846
I should mind
my own goddamn business.

522
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:18,143
A simple rule.
A simple, little rule.

523
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:19,520
There's gotta be
some dry clothes...

524
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:22,523
in this house.

525
00:50:22,648 --> 00:50:26,068
Don't open the package.

526
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:27,694
Nothing but trouble,
you open the goddamn package.

527
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,447
Lai:
Frank.

528
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:35,536
What are you doing?

529
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:37,371
Making up for the trouble.

530
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:44,837
Wait, wait.

531
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:45,879
Why are you making...

532
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:47,381
No more questions.

533
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:51,009
Wait.

534
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:53,053
I don't like it
when things get complicated.

535
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:55,514
You like things simple.

536
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:57,224
Very simple.

537
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:15,325
I'm not so clear
about the house.

538
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,744
Could you explain...

539
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,205
uh, one more time.
After I left.

540
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:22,291
After you left, we went
for a walk on the beach.

541
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:23,750
- Had a swim.
- Where again?

542
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:24,877
Past the point.

543
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:26,670
Anyone else swimming
at that time?

544
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:27,671
No.

545
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:28,964
Did you see
anybody else swimming?

546
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:30,591
No. No one.

547
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:35,387
So, you took a walk,
had a swim...

548
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,681
on a beach where no one
else was swimming...

549
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,559
past the point
where you can't see...

550
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:43,103
or be seen from the beach
on either side...

551
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:45,939
which makes witnesses
a little hard to come by.

552
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:48,484
That's the point
of a romantic swim.

553
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:50,819
Who wants witnesses?

554
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:54,406
And then?

555
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,449
Then we came back
to the house...

556
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:56,700
found it on fire.

557
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:58,619
Just like that?
On fire?

558
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,078
Yes.

559
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:03,248
And the 5,000 rounds
of spent ammo...

560
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:05,125
my men found
all around the house?

561
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:06,585
Maybe they had
the wrong house.

562
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:07,961
Monsieur Frank...

563
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:10,839
people with
this kind of firepower...

564
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:14,051
do not make mistakes
about who they visit.

565
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:17,054
Who would want you this dead?

566
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,889
I don't know.

567
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:20,724
Any problems with a client?

568
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:22,976
I don't have clients.
I'm retired.

569
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,938
I live on my army pension,
you know that.

570
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:26,980
You have all the facts
of who I am...

571
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:28,774
and who I was.
You've had them for years.

572
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:30,651
Any enemies
you can think of?

573
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:31,652
People from the past?

574
00:52:31,777 --> 00:52:33,779
I left the past behind
when I moved here.

575
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:38,659
Huh. A past like yours
you never leave behind.

576
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:41,620
Commissaire,
on vous demande en bas.

577
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:43,831
I'll just be a moment.

578
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:45,374
Don't leave.

579
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:00,764
What are you doing?

580
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,850
Computers know everything.

581
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:04,017
You just need a password.

582
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:06,854
What, are you nuts?
We're in a police station.

583
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:08,313
You're always complaining.

584
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:11,108
Except when we make love.
Then you say nothing.

585
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:26,707
Aha.

586
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,334
Ah.

587
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:36,717
La la la

588
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,135
Hello.

589
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:39,678
See?

590
00:53:58,614 --> 00:53:59,907
So, where will you be staying?

591
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,241
I don't know.

592
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:03,869
Well, my cousin
has a small hotel.

593
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,289
Thanks, but we'll manage.

594
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:10,375
Without money,
it would be hard.

595
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,543
Here.
It's not much...

596
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,754
but at least
you won't go hungry.

597
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:16,173
Thank you.

598
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:29,061
Where are you going?

599
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:30,479
Going to see that guy.

600
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:31,939
Good luck.

601
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:33,273
One minute.

602
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:34,608
You're not coming?

603
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:35,859
No.

604
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:37,569
But he blew up your car.

605
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:38,946
I'll buy a new one.

606
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:40,364
He burned your house.

607
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:41,573
I'll rebuild it.

608
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:43,033
He tried to kill you!

609
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:44,785
And as far as he knows,
he succeeded.

610
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,161
Look, I'm going
to give you some advice.

611
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,287
I don't know
what you were into.

612
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:48,413
I don't care
what you were into.

613
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:49,456
But whoever wanted you dead...

614
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,457
thinks you're dead.

615
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,875
You have a free pass
to start over.

616
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,962
Here's the advice:
Start over!

617
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:04,555
There are 400 people dying...

618
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,474
in a container on a ship.

619
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:12,604
My father.

620
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,857
My sisters.

621
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:17,985
The ship arrives today.

622
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,321
They will make
my father a slave.

623
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:25,492
The only one who knows
the container number...

624
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,995
is that guy.

625
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,955
You're very good.

626
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:32,040
What do you mean?

627
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,959
The moment you saw
those pictures in my house...

628
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:36,128
you were setting me up
to get involved in this.

629
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:37,296
The breakfast.

630
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:38,881
Giving the excuse
to the cop to help me.

631
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:40,966
One lie after another.

632
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:44,845
Not everything is a lie.

633
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:47,181
Name one thing
that isn't?

634
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:52,436
What happened in the house...

635
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,937
between us...

636
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:56,815
that was not a lie.

637
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:01,570
You were a soldier.

638
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:04,490
Your job was to save people.

639
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,908
Past tense.

640
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:07,367
What does that mean?

641
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:09,244
It means I got tired
of seeing my best efforts...

642
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,038
get turned into bullshit
by the same people...

643
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:12,998
who paid me to do the job.

644
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:14,249
No one cared.

645
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:18,212
This time... I care.

646
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:35,729
Thank you.

647
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:47,032
Bonjour.

648
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,200
Bonjour.

649
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:49,743
No phone calls
for half an hour?

650
00:56:50,953 --> 00:56:52,704
Hello. Surprise!

651
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:00,879
Sit.

652
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:14,726
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

653
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:18,313
So, before we get
to the heart of the matter...

654
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,315
I have one question for you.

655
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,733
Why'd you try to kill me?

656
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,235
You lied to me.

657
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:24,778
You opened the package.

658
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:26,113
You broke the rules.

659
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:27,114
Your rules.

660
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:28,323
What did you
expect me to do...

661
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:30,367
recommend you for another job?

662
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:35,622
What's the ship number?

663
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,335
Mr. Transporter...

664
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,795
we can both agree...

665
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,839
I answered your first
question politely.

666
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,674
I won't answer any more...

667
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:49,761
so I suggest
you kill me right now...

668
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:52,556
and go screw yourself.

669
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,643
I can't find anything.

670
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:06,111
Oh, poor Frank.
What did she tell you?

671
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,697
We're smuggling people
in containers?

672
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:11,450
I tell you, Lai's
the perfect name for her.

673
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:12,951
Secretary, On Intercom:
Mr. Kwai's on the way up.

674
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:13,952
Your father's here.

675
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:16,079
He'll really get
a kick out of this.

676
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:17,789
I thought your father
was in a container.

677
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:19,666
Yes! I... I mean, no.

678
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:22,294
There are 400 people
in that container.

679
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,047
Stay where you are!

680
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,633
She's a real heartbreaker,
isn't she, Frank?

681
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:31,970
10 seconds, 2 choices.

682
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:34,473
The information on the paper
or your brains on the desk!

683
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:35,724
Now tell me I'm lying!

684
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,309
- 9... 8...
- Frank: Lai.

685
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:38,977
Lai, give me
the gun.

686
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:40,229
I don't know
what you're talking about.

687
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:42,064
...6... 5...

688
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,857
4... 3...

689
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:44,858
2...

690
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:46,235
...one.

691
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,486
Shoot.

692
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:52,825
Lai!

693
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:03,794
Would I kill
my own daughter?

694
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,797
Lai.

695
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,508
Come on now.

696
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:10,801
Put it down.

697
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:15,722
We'll talk.

698
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:19,560
She thinks we're smuggling
people in containers.

699
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:22,437
I don't know where
you get these ideas!

700
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:23,522
Stay away!

701
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:30,904
Would you kill
your own father?

702
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,531
Please...

703
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,199
I am begging you.

704
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:36,034
Stop what you are doing.

705
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:37,828
I do what I do.

706
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:39,204
I am who I am.

707
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:40,455
I'll never change.

708
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:42,916
So if you're
going to kill me...

709
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,084
kill me.

710
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:46,170
But if you don't...

711
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:47,546
get this gun
out of my face!

712
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:52,426
Give me.

713
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:53,510
No!

714
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,013
I know he's innocent.

715
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:57,890
Oh, you have
such a good heart.

716
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:01,101
Always interested in
saving innocent people.

717
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:02,811
Well, here's
your big chance.

718
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:04,104
Drop your gun...

719
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:06,690
and you will save one.

720
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:13,739
- Kill him!
- No!

721
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:18,202
The police are
on their way up.

722
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:19,786
- What now?
- Take her.

723
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:23,415
Send in Leo.

724
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:25,042
I need him to wrap
something up.

725
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,351
Just for the record...

726
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:44,645
there aren't 400 people
in that container.

727
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:48,690
Only 395 made it here alive.

728
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:50,442
Frank!

729
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:55,989
Inspector.
Am I glad you're here.

730
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:57,366
What is this?

731
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:58,283
What is this?

732
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:00,327
This man used
my partner's daughter here...

733
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,787
to try and blackmail us.

734
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,414
Luckily, my security
got the drop on him.

735
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,251
I wanna press charges...
kidnapping...

736
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:08,669
extortion, assault.

737
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,045
I know this man.

738
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:11,922
Well, I suppose
in your business...

739
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:14,049
you have to know all types.

740
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:18,095
Now, should I call my lawyer?

741
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:19,805
We'll handle it.

742
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:26,603
I'll expect all of you...

743
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,397
down at my office
to give your statements.

744
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:30,315
As soon as I contact
my lawyer...

745
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,401
we'll be more
than happy to oblige.

746
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,452
Ohh. Mmm...

747
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:53,547
The doctor said
you will have a headache...

748
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:55,424
for a few days
and then everything...

749
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:56,800
will go back to normal.

750
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:57,843
Where are they?

751
01:01:57,926 --> 01:02:00,429
Ah, I think you should
be more concerned...

752
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:02,764
with where you are.

753
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:06,268
What got into you?

754
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:07,895
You were always so careful.

755
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,521
I've got to get out of here.

756
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:11,940
Oh, well,
with the charges they filed...

757
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,233
you will not be getting out...

758
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:14,860
for a very long time.

759
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:17,362
Assaulting a distinguished member...

760
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:19,907
of the international
business community...

761
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:21,408
kidnapping his daughter...

762
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:22,409
extortion.

763
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:25,454
I'm sorry, Frank.

764
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:27,456
I would like to help you...

765
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:30,042
but if you continue
with the same old story...

766
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:32,586
"I am retired,
living on a pension..."

767
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:36,048
I need fresh, Frank.

768
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:37,633
I need new.

769
01:02:37,758 --> 01:02:39,927
For once,
I need the truth.

770
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:45,057
OK.

771
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:47,267
They're smuggling people.

772
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:48,644
From Asia through Marseilles...

773
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,062
in containers.

774
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:53,774
You know this for fact?

775
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:55,859
The girl told me.

776
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,027
You believe her?

777
01:02:57,152 --> 01:02:58,654
Yes.

778
01:02:58,779 --> 01:02:59,738
In French we have a saying...

779
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:01,198
"Never believe the cook."

780
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,660
She's not the cook.

781
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,286
Oh.

782
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:08,539
I suspected.

783
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:09,873
You know, Frank...

784
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:10,958
no one is perfect.

785
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,376
So you're saying
you're gonna do nothing?

786
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:13,836
No, I'm saying...

787
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,004
I'm going to start
an investigation.

788
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,589
And in the meantime,
the 400 people...

789
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,341
in that container
could be dead already.

790
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:21,385
But what am I
supposed to do?

791
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:22,427
There are laws.

792
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:23,762
Did it ever occur
to you that sometimes...

793
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:24,888
you have to make
your own law?

794
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:26,014
Like you do?

795
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:27,432
At least with me,
it doesn't take 12 months...

796
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:28,433
to get the job done.

797
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,434
Oh, yes, I know.

798
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,271
That's what I admire
about you, Frank.

799
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:33,730
All that army training...

800
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:36,316
all that sneaking around...

801
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,443
a man like you could
probably resolve this case...

802
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:39,987
in, how long?

803
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,156
12 hours?

804
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:43,448
Less.

805
01:03:43,574 --> 01:03:45,033
Less?

806
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:46,827
Impressive.

807
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,163
You would be the perfect man
for the job.

808
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:50,372
Yes...

809
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:51,832
if I were out.

810
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:52,833
Yes...

811
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,585
if you were out.

812
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:17,274
Anybody moves
and I kill him.

813
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:19,693
Personne ne bouge.
Baissez vos armes.

814
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,987
Ce type est dingue
et capable de tout.

815
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:31,079
I met him in the Bahamas

816
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,789
I love that nigga persona

817
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:34,124
Smoke that nigga marijuana

818
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:35,751
Get freaky, call me Madonna

819
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:36,793
Lay on the bed, he follow

820
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:38,420
Bone him until tomorrow

821
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:40,005
Make him sing high soprano

822
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,423
Ahh

823
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:42,674
54-50-50

824
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:44,092
Mr. Act-Super-Kinky

825
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:45,219
Baby, what you gonna get me

826
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:46,970
Is rings for my little pinkie

827
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:48,180
Money will multiply

828
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:49,598
Before you run up inside

829
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:52,476
Make me all weak
and tired, mm-hmm

830
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:55,979
If this is
how you transport...

831
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:58,774
I'm amazed you get
any work at all.

832
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:00,275
Come on and give me a hand.

833
01:05:09,785 --> 01:05:11,370
Maybe I should go with you?

834
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:14,122
Thanks, but, uh,
I'm better alone.

835
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,167
That is a very small boat...

836
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:18,752
to fight a very big war.

837
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:20,712
Yep.

838
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:22,339
But it's a good boat.

839
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:24,091
Frank, here.

840
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:26,635
You'll need it.

841
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:32,099
Or maybe not.

842
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,188
The shipment's cleared.

843
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:02,523
Here's the paperwork.

844
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:03,857
Take the highway
all the way...

845
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:05,567
to the first exit... Lyon.

846
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:07,402
Go straight
to the warehouse.

847
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,404
We'll be right behind you
just in case.

848
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:28,298
OK, we are ready to go.

849
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:35,848
Lai, dear...

850
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,024
I spent thousands of dollars...

851
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:48,485
for you to go to school
and learn English.

852
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:50,320
The least you can do
is speak it.

853
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:51,738
I hate you.

854
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,370
I'm still your father.

855
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:01,582
Get her out of here!

856
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:19,850
Aah!

857
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:22,895
Give me a minute.

858
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,271
Ohh!

859
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:28,901
Aah!

860
01:08:28,984 --> 01:08:30,027
Aah!

861
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:32,529
Yah!

862
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:33,739
Uhh!

863
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,542
Aah!

864
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:51,215
Keep him alive.

865
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,801
Let's go!

866
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:34,610
No, don't!

867
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:38,197
Let's go!

868
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:03,305
Aah!

869
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:16,128
Ohh!

870
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:22,885
Ohh...

871
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:38,275
Ohh...

872
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:42,696
Ohh...

873
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:46,533
Uhh!

874
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:10,349
Ohh! Aah!

875
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:11,600
Ohh!

876
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:10,868
Oh, shit!

877
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:12,995
- Aah!

878
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:24,877
Ohh!

879
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,878
Ohh!

880
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,012
Get ready-ready-ready to rock

881
01:16:35,012 --> 01:16:37,431
Get ready-ready-ready to rock

882
01:16:37,556 --> 01:16:39,850
Get ready-ready-ready to rock

883
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,051
Bitch!

884
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:00,430
Good morning.

885
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:01,431
Pilot:
Good morning.

886
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:03,475
Oh...

887
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:05,102
I'm looking to do
a little sightseeing.

888
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:06,979
This plane is not
for tourists.

889
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:11,275
I'm not a tourist.

890
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,551
Frank: Call this guy
and tell him to meet me.

891
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:38,552
Pilot:
Sure.

892
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:40,012
Where?

893
01:18:41,638 --> 01:18:43,015
Down there.

894
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:12,711
Here!

895
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:19,593
Careful!

896
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:40,447
Ohh! Aah!

897
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:01,927
Ohh... Aah!

898
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:04,972
Move up.

899
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:29,663
Get down.

900
01:20:50,142 --> 01:20:51,351
Aah!

901
01:20:54,313 --> 01:20:55,189
Aah!

902
01:21:22,299 --> 01:21:23,509
Ahh!

903
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,068
Get closer!

904
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,741
- Steady!
- No, Dad, stop!

905
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:35,581
- Get away!
- Aah!

906
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:51,388
Aah!

907
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:15,913
Aah!

908
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:18,290
Aah!

909
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:22,294
Aah!

910
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:23,420
Aah!

911
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,466
Aah!

912
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,168
Kwai, Cocking Gun:
Down!

913
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,931
Hands on your head.

914
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:18,517
Move!

915
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:22,229
Watch her.

916
01:24:22,354 --> 01:24:23,814
If she moves
or I don't return...

917
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:25,232
shoot her!

918
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,736
To the water.

919
01:24:29,862 --> 01:24:31,655
I'm really not
in the mood for a swim.

920
01:24:31,738 --> 01:24:32,656
March!

921
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:37,619
So, how did
a lowlife like you...

922
01:24:37,703 --> 01:24:38,871
end up with my daughter?

923
01:24:38,996 --> 01:24:41,081
Found her in a bag.
Isn't that where you left her?

924
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:42,166
You know nothing.

925
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:43,333
Move!

926
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:49,339
You got involved
with the wrong girl...

927
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:50,382
you dumb shit.

928
01:24:50,507 --> 01:24:52,968
The delivery will be made.

929
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:54,261
My daughter
will get over it.

930
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:56,722
If I'm lucky,
maybe she'll see the light.

931
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:05,772
Yeah, if she's lucky
maybe you'll get hit by a truck.

932
01:25:05,898 --> 01:25:07,274
What do you know?

933
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:09,443
I know she'll never stop
being who she is...

934
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:12,112
and she'll never be you
or anything like you.

935
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:13,697
She'll come around...

936
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,365
but you won't be here
to see it.

937
01:25:15,491 --> 01:25:17,034
Lai: No!

938
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,298
I guess she won't be
coming around after all.

939
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:34,051
Turn around!

940
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:35,594
I'd rather see it coming.

941
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:37,554
Makes no difference to me.

942
01:26:03,163 --> 01:26:05,374
He was a bastard...

943
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:08,126
but he was still
my father.

944
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,143
Pretty impressive timing, Frank.

945
01:26:27,813 --> 01:26:30,357
I guess I underestimated you.
