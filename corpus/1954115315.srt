1
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,400
I can't believe we're actually
staying with Cameron Hunter.

2
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
This is a dream come true

3
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,400
I've seen every one of your movies
at least five times

4
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm sorry ...

5
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I mean, you can have any girl you want.

6
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,100
True.

7
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,100
I want you.

8
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,500
And you.

9
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
and them

10
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
and them

11
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,200
Hold on.

12
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,500
Cameron!

13
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Cameron!

14
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Cameron!

15
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Ah! Morning Cheeky

16
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,300
Morning Boss! Bright eyed and
bushy tailed this morning aren't we?

17
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,600
I want a drink.

18
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,800
You know there's some ... uh ...
guests up in the master bedroom.

19
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do you think they could be
gone by, uh, noon?

20
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Of course.

21
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Are there any messages?

22
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,700
On the machine? Um, your publicist
left one to catch your photograph.

23
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,900
You have a tasting at 1 for tonight,
a sit down with props at 2,

24
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,100
haircut 3:45, you get to meet
the wife of your banker at 6, and

25
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,300
don' t forget the training at 8.
OK?

26
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Is there any way I could get out of it?

27
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Oh, and, Lou called wondering where you are.

28
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
Shit, I forgot, could you
call him and tell him ...

29
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
you'll be late... I did.

30
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
you did good.

31
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I'll bring the car around,
you check the messages, OK?

32
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,700
You have fourteen messages.

33
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
How you doing, kid?

34
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
You look great.

35
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
All right.

36
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
What's up Lou?
- Great news.

37
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Mystique has "Space Buddies 2"
in mind with you.

38
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
no more sequels.

39
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Right!

40
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
We'll just tell them "No Thanks".

41
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I'm serious.

42
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
I want to do something else.

43
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,900
I want to do this.

44
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
man, there's a chill.

45
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
It's an art film.

46
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
done by some kids, just out of film school.

47
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
It's deep.

48
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
It's dark.

49
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
It's edgy.

50
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
there's not even dialogue
for the first half hour.

51
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Gee, sounds great.

52
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Doesn't it!

53
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
You're kidding me, right?

54
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,200
This is going to be a move,
where I can get the respect I deserve.

55
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Respect!

56
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I'll tell you what people respect.

57
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
An actor who gets 3 million a picture.

58
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's what people respect.

59
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
You know how many people
out there would kill to be you?

60
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Right now, in this city,

61
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
there's probably some young
schmuck out there thinking,

62
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I wish I were Cameron Hunter.

63
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You know, I can't get arrested
in this town as an actor,

64
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
and that guy made
20 million dollars a picture.

65
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
It's not fair.

66
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
You know what, I'm sure
something will come up eventually

67
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Yeah, I gotta get a job.

68
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh hey, my buddy just called.

69
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
You can work at a place in Beverly Hills.

70
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Delivering pizzas you can
get $300 a day in tips

71
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
the number's on there
if you're interested.

72
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I can't, I want to be available
for auditions.

73
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I hate to be the one to break this to you,
but you're not getting any auditions.

74
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
That's because of Cameron Hunter.

75
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I can't get arrested in this town
because I look too like him.

76
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Why don't you go back to your music?

77
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
You used to love that stuff.
Look at these trophies and stuff

78
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
they loved you.

79
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
you looked happier there.

80
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Yeah, what happened to your ambition?

81
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,700
You know, I thought you were going to be
a great big famous screenwriter.

82
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,900
I am

83
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I just can't write now,
it's all in a mess.

84
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
You know what?

85
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Screw this

86
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm going surfing,

87
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
I'm tired of talking about this crap.

88
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
You coming?

89
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
It will do you some good.

90
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
No, I'm good.

91
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Yeah, no, it's gonna be good

92
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Yeah, I know, it's here early.

93
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
see you when you get here.

94
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
the blonde...
all right.

95
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
who's the other one?
No, no, not the little one

96
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,700
we still got ...

97
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Hey, when you get over here ...

98
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,300
Uh, I got to go. Bye.

99
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Hi. Hi Karen.
what are you doing here?

100
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Well, I was on my way to do
something at a Shakespeare festival,

101
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,700
and I thought I would surprise you.

102
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
You did.

103
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Come in.

104
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
Hi.
Hi.

105
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
So, what's going on here?
You, um, having a party or something?

106
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,800
Kind of. It's like a Friday
night thing, you know?

107
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
A bunch of people
come over, party,

108
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
It's whether I want it or not
they're going to come over, so...

109
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Hmm, you have quite a
social life, don't you?

110
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Every time I see you out, you're usually
with this girl, or that girl...

111
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
You know that's all for the press.

112
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
You are the only one I love.

113
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
You know that.

114
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
Then why don't you live in the
market with me?

115
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
You know I can't do that.

116
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Why don't you just stay here?

117
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
oh, Hollywood isn't me.

118
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Besides, where I live
I could be chairman in 4 more years.

119
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
You want to know what's on the ????

120
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
No, later.
I want to know what time your flight s.

121
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
It's in a few hours. Why?

122
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
I was just thinking

123
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,200
that doesn't give us a lot of time.

124
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Time for what?

125
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Karen

126
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Don't stay away too long.

127
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I need you.

128
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I mean, this is a great time.

129
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
It's so much better with you here.

130
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,700
Cameron, things come so easy for you.

131
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
I think you need to challenge yourself.

132
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Find something that

133
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
that you can use your heart at.

134
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Otherwise, all this
success is going to ruin you.

135
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
I'm going to make you proud of me.

136
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Hello!

137
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Hello Cameron. Are you sitting down?

138
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,300
What?

139
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Listen to this.

140
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,700
I got Kaufman to come to 22 five
in Space Buddies 2.

141
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
All you gotta do is the usual and
show up for the role.

142
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Great, yeah but,
you know what I think?

143
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
I think I am going to slip
away somewhere

144
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Somewhere like a cabin away where
I can't be bothered by this sort of call.

145
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
Really getting tired of this.

146
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
I'm going to lose... 50 pounds.

147
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Listen slick.

148
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,300
When life hands you a glass of lemonade,
don't make lemons.

149
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,600
We worked hard on this.

150
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Don't blow it.

151
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,900
I'll call you tomorrow.

152
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
I got pizza!

154
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Happy boy!

155
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, pizza

156
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,000
Can I help you?

157
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Yeah, uh, who's gonna pay for the pizza?

158
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Here why don't you meet me
at the bottom of the stairs.

159
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
On the... OK.

160
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh, I don't believe this.

161
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
That's pretty fucking amazing.

162
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah.

163
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
What is this some pay you
to look like that?

164
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
No, no, I'm just delivering pizza.

165
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You like that job?

166
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
No. No.

167
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Look you know, I'm sorry if
I caused any trouble

168
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,500
Pizza comes to $22.50.

169
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Why don't you have a slice on me. I might
have a little better proposition for you.

170
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,900
Let's say that you disappeared from
the face of the earth for.. 30 days.

171
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Do you think anyone might notice?

172
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Probably not.

173
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
You know, you could help me.
- How?

174
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
You could pretend to be me.

175
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
You could be Cameron Hunter.

176
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,100
I mean, that way I could get out of here,
go where I want to go.

177
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
You really think that anyone
would be fooled by that?

178
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Oh Yeah!
People believe what they see.

179
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
All you have to do is just stay here.

180
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
Hang out for a while.

181
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
You go do some clothes,

182
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
Hang out with some girls

183
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Do what's your thing

184
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
You can drive my Porsche.

185
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,900
You have a Porsche?

186
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
I'll give you my credit card

187
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Hell, I could pay you,
like, 50 grand.

188
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Do you know what,
do you really need these?

189
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,700
No, I only wear them so
I don't look like you.

190
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,000
That is really amazing.

191
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Yeah, you know what, this isn't gonna work

192
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
I don't think I can do it.

193
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Oh sure you will.

194
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
50 grand?

195
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But, you can't tell anybody.

196
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Alright? You can't tell my manager,
not my assistant Jenkins

197
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Don't have any contact with
Sue or Jenkins,

198
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
sign contracts or autographs,
anything like that.

199
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
So what do you say?

200
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
excuse me

201
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Oh, hey boss.

202
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
You're Jenkins?

203
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
What?

204
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Nothing.

205
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Rough night?

206
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Yeah, kind of.

207
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Jesus, what is this?

208
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Oh, uh, we ran out of garlic so,
I used pepper.

209
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Yeah, that gives it a kick.

210
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I got your message and put
Tom Hicks on for today,

211
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Do you want me to stick around here
and field calls for you?

212
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
No, I don't.

213
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,700
Is everything OK?

214
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
yeah.

215
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Listen, why don't you just
take the day off?

216
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,300
OK, now I know there's something wrong.
I'm calling your internist.

217
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
No, no, no everything is alright
it's just

218
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
I'm just taking a bit of time off.

219
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
That's all. Look, I'll call
you if I need you.

220
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
You're sure?
Yeah.

221
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
OK.

222
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Ok, I'm going to leave my cell phone
on if you change your mind.

223
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Lou called twice, and a
reporter called also.

224
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Have a fun day.

225
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Alright. Enjoy yourself.

226
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,300
I would like to thank all the
little people who made me the

227
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
people's favourite this year,
Cameron Hunter.

228
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Sam, dude, you gotta get up here.
you're not going to believe where I am.

229
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
Come here, come here, look.

230
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,100
full entertainment system, 5 player CDs,
that's awesome right there.

231
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
Look at this. Beer

232
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,500
look, look, look, look.
my own refrigerator.

233
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
it's got two doors.

234
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
It's like all of a sudden I'm famous.

235
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
I always wanted to be the best friend
of a star.

236
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
Holy!

237
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
get naked!

238
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,700
This is gonna be so much fun!
Yeah, look at that.

239
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,900
We gotta meet them.
We have to. Yeah.

240
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
OK. Remember, I'm Cameron.

241
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Oh, hi. Sorry for using your pool,
it's a hot day.

242
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Please don't call the police.
We so wanted to meet you.

243
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,900
No that's uh, fine, you know.
It's always a pleasure to meet my public.

244
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Would you like to come in?

245
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,300
That's funny, because we were just
thinking about going swimming.

246
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
who are you?

247
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Whoa, excuse me. I'm Tim's friend.

248
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
And who is Tim?

249
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Cameron, Cameron, yeah Cameron's friend.

250
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

251
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
No, it's all cool.

252
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Cameron's down by the pool,
we're just having some brews.

253
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,900
Sorry about the flash.
You must be Jenkins.

254
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,100
Tell Cameron that I will be doing things
in his office, alright?

255
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Do you want a beer?
- No thanks.

256
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Love that skirt!

257
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,700
oh good.
Oh, I could live like this.

258
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
very nice.
Hi!

259
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
that's happening!

260
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,300
ooh, that's bad.
What are these, imported? Agh.

261
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
yeah, it said they're from Cuba.
Agh.

262
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Sticking to beer.
Yeah, right on.

263
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
Hey! 2 drinks.

264
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
15 bucks each.

265
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,300
I told him to put it on the tab.
- Oh yeah!

266
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Have you seen anyone in here?
- yeah I took a loop around.

267
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Really? Yeah you wouldn't believe it.

268
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,900
I just ... I didn't mean ...
Isn't that your assistant?

269
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,100
That girl over there ...
That one right there?

270
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Dude, every girl wants to fuck
Cameron Hunter.

271
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Hello.

272
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,700
You're not supposed to answer the phone.

273
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Cameron?

274
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Hey look, I don't have long to talk
before this cell phone dies.

275
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm in a cabin.

276
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
You know what, I've even got
a mosquito bite.

277
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Do you know how long its been since
I've had a mosquito bite?

278
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
No.
Hey, uh, that Jenkins...

279
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Uh, do I do her too?

280
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
No, no, not her, ok,
this is business.

281
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,600
You even try to do her you'll get
arrested, alright?

282
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Ok. Hey, your agent's been calling.

283
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Alright, well don't talk to him. If he talks
to you, you make no decisions, ok?

284
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Ok, will do.

285
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Ok, talk to you later.
- Ok.

286
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Hi, may I help you?

287
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Cameron, it's me. from Stanford.
We have an interview today.

288
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We do? Yeah. My editor helped
me come up with 200 questions.

289
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
We'll finally get to the bottom
of Cameron Hunter.

290
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Oh, no, no we're not, you see, I mean,

291
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I've been sick, I've been throwing up all day, and

292
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
maybe, you could come back
in a couple weeks.

293
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
A couple of weeks?

294
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Yeah, you know,
Sam can show you out.

295
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Can you do that?
- Um... door.

296
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Bye.

297
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
So, you're a friend of Cameron's.

298
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Well, would you mind helping
me to get into Cameron?

299
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,200
If he decides to do what
ever things I'm into.

300
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
It would really help me out.

301
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
I don't know.

302
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
It's my job to get close to a star.

303
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
And if that happens to mean
close to their friend

304
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
then I don't mind.
I'm more than willing. - Really?

305
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Are you sure you're not interested
in helping me out?

306
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I'll make it worth your while.

307
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Well, ... maybe.

308
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
So, what do you know about ...

309
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So you're gonna help me?

310
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
yeah, I guess.

311
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,400
So, what good gossip are you going to
come up with now we're partners?

312
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Well, I told you everything I know.

313
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
really I don't know him too well.

314
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But you said you would help me out.

315
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
No, I never said that.
Beer?

316
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,400
You bastard!
- Wait a second, I had fun didn't you?

317
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Thanks for coming.

318
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Get it? thanks for coming.

319
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I love being a movie star.

320
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Get the phone.

321
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
I thought you weren't supposed
to answer the phone.

322
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
What's the fun of being Cameron Hunter if
you can't actually be Cameron Hunter?

323
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
See, let it ring for a couple.

324
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Cameron Hunter.

325
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
What!

326
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,400
Yeah!
Hold it.

327
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Ok, give me the number.

328
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Ok, got it.
OK, I'll call you back.

329
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Hey, hey!

330
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
That was Steven Kaufman for us.

331
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
The Steven Kaufman?

332
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Yeah, he wants me to go in and audition
for his film "Space Buddies 2".

333
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,800
No, he wants Cameron Hunter to
go and audition.

334
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
What's the difference?

335
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,900
Might be fun to screw around with
Steven Kaufman. What do you think?

336
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,100
I think you need to get out of the pool.
I need another beer, you want one?

337
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,300
Uh, yeah, Steven Kaufman please.

338
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Space Buddies did what, ah,
200 million?

339
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,700
We're gonna double that, you and me.
You believe that?

340
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,900
If you say so.
- I do say so.

341
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Listen, the effects that we got lined up
for Space Buddies 2 are a must-see.

342
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,300
That and the signings.
I swear, a true story.

343
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Alright, listen.

344
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,700
Come on. This isn't an audition.
You're Cameron Hunter.

345
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,900
You can do this part in your sleep.
Ok?

346
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,100
I just want to hear you're in with
Jennifer Parkin, that's all.

347
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
Jennifer Parkin?

348
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
Yeah. You didn't hear?

349
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,700
Aw, man, you are gonna love this
sweet sweet role.

350
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,900
Yeah, send her in.

351
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Mmm. It's all good Cameron.

352
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Hello everyone.

353
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Jennifer, how are you?

354
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,700
Hi.
Thanks for coming down.

355
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,900
Lou Spiro. marketing.

356
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,100
Love your work. Love it.

357
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,300
You should have gotten a statue
for your work on Night Tales, definitely.

358
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,500
That's a real sweet thing to say. Thankyou.

359
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:26,800
yeah well, let's just jump in, you know?
See where we're at.

360
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Please have a seat.

361
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Cameron.

362
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,400
You're Mark McCoy. Space pirate.

363
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Jennifer. You are a Federation spy with
a heart of gold.

364
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
Now.

365
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Make me feel the long living human love.

366
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
Make me feel the vastness of space.

367
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
and. action.

368
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,600
what are you doing up here?

369
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Starbase regulations,
all passengers in the back.

370
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm not a passenger, remember?

371
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
I'm a stowaway.

372
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,400
I remember. and just as soon as we get back
to the bend, your ass is going back.

373
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
there's a hefty reward for fugitives.

374
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Is that all that I am to you?
Just reward money?

375
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You and I had something more.

376
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,900
Listen, lady. Or whatever you are.

377
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,100
As far as I'm concerned, you're cargo.

378
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,300
I've got a spaceship to fly.

379
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Not for long if you don't watch
for that asteroid!

380
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
It's Ok, sister.
I can do this.

381
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,900
I've been flying in space since
I was 14 years old.

382
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,100
You know, I'm sorry, I'm having a
time with this dialogue, it's tough.

383
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,300
I mean, maybe he just doesn't want it,
out of a growing awareness of the shades.

384
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
Kind of adds a whole new level of interest.

385
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,700
Yeah. yeah, um...

386
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,900
No.

387
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:09,100
No. you know, what we have
here is an action picture.

388
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,300
Ok?

389
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,500
Alright?

390
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,700
Lou, back me up here. I mean, let me
just show you, in the climax here

391
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,900
your character, Mark McCoy,

392
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
blasts into hyperdrive.
and what does he do?

393
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,300
he shoots right into the middle
of this planet

394
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
I mean, right into it. What happens?
What happens?

395
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,700
There is an explosion!

396
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,900
the biggest, most amazing explosion
ever to be seen on the big screen.

397
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,100
Ok?

398
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,300
This planet, you gotta see what we do
with this planet, is unbelievable.

399
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
it's so incredible.

400
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,700
the audience is gonna be sitting there going
Oh my God, look how beautiful, and

401
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,900
boom, it's all gone, I want to look
and I can't look.

402
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,100
You got to see it, you will you get it,
you see, you have the means.

403
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,300
So that's about it.

404
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,500
I was just living where, deep in
the character you know.

405
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,700
yeah, absolutely, I am all up for
suggestions.

406
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,900
hah, we should get that out of the way.

407
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,100
Ok, indulge me,

408
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,300
give me that Cameron Hunter laugh

409
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Just once, come on.

410
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,700
No, no.
- Come on.

411
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,900
I couldn't.

412
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Please

413
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,300
Uh, I have a sore throat.
It hurts.

414
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Oh gosh, thank God.

415
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Lou, you're scaring me.

416
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,900
Alright, there's plenty of time to save
that, right? Right.

417
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,100
Well, I have to go everybody. I have a
function I am late for.

418
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Jenny, thank you so much for coming in.
We'll be in touch.

419
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
I'll walk you out.

420
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,700
So, that went well.
Please have a seat.

421
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,900
I am prepared to offer you the role,
right now.

422
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,100
You're kidding.

423
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,300
No, no, you're prepared to offer Cameron
Hunter the role, right now, right?

424
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
yeah, what do you need, an interpreter?

425
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,700
Yes, that's right. yes.

426
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,900
Look, I got a deal ready right here.
I want you to sign that.

427
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,100
You can play today, or the studio's
gonna make me go with the second choice.

428
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,300
Hold on, Cameron, we've got some
problems, don't you remember?

429
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Wow, what's this?

430
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,700
yeah, uh, well we got some ideas we thought
would strengthen the story.

431
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,900
You do have you?

432
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,100
and uh, Cameron doesn't sign until
you take a look at this story.

433
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,300
Well, I don't know about that.

434
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,500
yeah, yeah. I'll sign, only if you agree to
hire Sam to do a rewrite.

435
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,700
What is, what is this you come in here
and lay this on me?

436
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,900
No, you don't come to my office and
tell me how to run my picture, ok?

437
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,100
hey, did you believe me?

438
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
that was good.

439
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,500
Kinda got you on that.

440
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,700
You're good. You got balls kid.
So I'm gonna agree to see your first draft.

441
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,900
and that's it.

442
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,100
and also, you agree to sign on, today.

443
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,300
Now I'm not trying to cut you off in this,
we're doing business.

444
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Two weeks from now, what are
you going to be saying?

445
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,700
I fucked up.

446
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
Don't let that happen.

447
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:31,100
Ok, but can we wait, can we wait a few
more minutes and tell Lou about it?

448
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,300
Absolutely.

449
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,500
Just sign.

450
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,700
What were you thinking dude?

451
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
What, what’s wrong, I got you some work.

452
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,100
Yeah you also signed Cameron Hunter
up for a movie.

453
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,300
yeah but its Space Buddies part 2.

454
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
I'm sure he'll like it.

455
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,700
and look what Jennifer gave me.

456
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,900
It says call me.
- Nice.

457
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,100
Its Jennifer Parkin.

458
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,300
hook me up man, you think she has a friend?

459
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,500
I don't know.

460
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,700
Well, movie star, I'm outta here.
I gotta start writing.

461
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,900
Yeah, and I got to see Jennifer tonight,
and I don’t know what to do.

462
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,100
Oh, take her some place you'll feel good.
Don't forget that you are Cameron Hunter.

463
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,300
I mean, look at that.

464
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
And don't forget the laugh.

465
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,700
I'll see you tomorrow.

466
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,900
What a darling little place.

467
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,100
Whose place is this?

468
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,300
Oh, uh, this is where I lived when I first
moved to Los Angeles.

469
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,500
I keep it as a way of remembering
the years of struggle.

470
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,700
It's a wonderful idea.

471
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,900
Do you have a bottle of water?

472
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,100
no. no.

473
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,300
You know, you're more beautiful in person
than you are on television.

474
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
that's so sweet.

475
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,700
would you like to take my clothes off?

476
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,900
and go slow 'cause, I'm a little bit shy.

477
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,100
really?

478
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,300
sit down.

479
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:00,500
That's it. I've now fallen into bed with
a fabulous guy worth over 23 million.

480
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,700
That's what this was all about?

481
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,900
Oh don't tell me you're offended.

482
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,100
You seemed to be enjoying yourself.

483
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,300
Ok, let's go over the ground zero.

484
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
There's always a bunch of photographers
right out front

485
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,700
and when they see us together

486
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,900
it will make all the magazine covers
for a month.

487
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,100
I thought maybe we could stay in.

488
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,300
go over the script, run some lines
and stuff?

489
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,500
Please, I don't do that shit unless
I'm getting paid for it.

490
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,700
So, let's go on, come on.

491
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,900
No, no, I think I'm gonna stay here tonight.

492
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,100
now wait a minute honey.

493
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,300
You say no to Jennifer Parkin,
she doesn't ask again.

494
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Are you gonna go?

495
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,700
No?

496
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,900
Suit yourself.

497
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,100
Oh, no, thanks.

498
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,300
I was wondering how long it would take
for you

499
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,500
to stop pretending that you like this stuff.

500
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,700
What do you mean pretending?

501
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,900
Is there something you want to tell me?

502
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,100
What do you mean?

503
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,300
About the fact that

504
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,600
Cameron Hunter hates orange juice.

505
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,800
and he happens to be left handed.

506
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Hey, hey,
- what did you do with Cameron?

507
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,200
my name is Tim Bennet.

508
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Cameron hired me to replace him
for a few weeks.

509
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,600
Do you believe me?

510
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Well, I, I wouldn't normally, but...

511
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
it sounds like something Cameron would do.

512
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,200
My God, the resemblance is remarkable.

513
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,400
yeah.

514
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
Listen, he didn't want anybody to know.

515
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,800
and I promised him I would
leave his life as I found it.

516
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So, nobody knows.

517
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
No, I mean, I even fooled Steven Kaufman.

518
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,400
wait, when did you talk to Steven Kaufman?

519
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,600
He called me for an audition.

520
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Ok don't go. Cameron doesn't want anything
to do with that Space Buddies sequel.

521
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
He doesn't?

522
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,200
No, nothing.

523
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,400
The best thing you can do is just stay away
from Kaufman, from Lou, from anyone.

524
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,600
I'll cover for you.

525
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,800
I don't want you making any messes
that he can't clean up.

526
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Wait, here's my card.

527
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
You call me if you need anything.

528
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,400
and do not use that phone.

529
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,600
Right. Ok.

530
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,800
Cameron, you there, the studio tells
me you added a condition to Space Buddies.

531
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Hello.- Cameron.
Yeah.

532
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
Hello, uh, I've changed my mind
about Space Buddies.

533
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,400
Don't start that nonsense again.

534
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,600
You want to get sued for breach?

535
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,800
You want to be the most hated in town?

536
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But Lou.

537
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,200
I told them we'd meet about it.

538
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,400
Ah, yeah, sure.

539
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,600
That's my boy.

540
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,800
Jesus.

541
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Look, it's Cameron Hunter!

542
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Hello.

543
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,400
Cameron?

544
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,600
Excuse me,

545
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,800
What the hell are you doing in here?

546
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Hi honey, want to wash my back?

547
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
No!

548
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,400
You what, this is getting out of hand.

549
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,600
You can't break in to someone's
house like this.

550
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,800
You know you're lucky I don't bop you.
- You want to bop me?

551
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
No, I'm serious. You gotta get out of there.

552
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,200
You mean get out like this?

553
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,400
No, uh, hello, uh, no.

554
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,600
Come in!

555
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,800
What are you..

556
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Love, Cameron.

557
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,200
Shit!

558
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
Hello.

559
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,600
Sam, it's me, listen. Cameron's girlfriend
just came on to me.

560
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,800
What do you mean, came on?
You didn't do anything?

561
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
No. No, of course not.

562
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
No but I looked right at her.

563
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,400
Well, just stay away from her, alright?

564
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,600
Right, stay away from her. Bye.

565
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,800
Hey uh, I'm gonna go out for a few days,
so I'll see you later.

566
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
a few days?

567
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,200
You know what, I've got a lot of stuff to
do, so I'll call you in a couple of weeks.

568
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,400
How about we eat?

569
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,600
The Shakespeare festival was so great.

570
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,800
I met these people doing a regional
theatre company in town

571
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and they want me to consult on
their production

572
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,200
and they're gonna pay me.

573
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,400
so guess what?

574
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,600
I'm gonna be here for the whole week.

575
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,800
Great.

576
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Have you given any thought to what we talked
about before?

577
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,200
what were we talking about?

578
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,400
Cameron come on.

579
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,500
You know Karen, I got to say something.

580
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,800
I've got a million things to do. Maybe you
could stay at a hotel for a few days?

581
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
What is wrong with you?

582
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
Nothing.

583
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,400
I promise, you'll just have to
trust me on this.

584
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,600
I don't want to stay at a hotel.

585
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,800
I've been in a hotel all week.

586
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I hate hotels.

587
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,200
Ok, well, I gotta run and see Jenkins.

588
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,400
What is wrong with you?

589
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,600
Nothing.

590
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,800
Everything is going to be fine
in a few days.

591
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
OK.

592
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,200
Let's make love first.

593
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,400
Oh, no, no.

594
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
I mean, uh,

595
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,800
I'm trying to stay pure right now.

596
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
yeah, I'm preparing for this
really intense role,

597
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,200
what role?

598
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,400
the uh, space buddies 2.

599
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,600
whatever.

600
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,800
why don't you give me Jenkins address.

601
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
and I'll call you when you're making
some sense.

602
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,200
20 million dollars for this?

603
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,400
what's the difference

604
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,600
life has no meaning.

605
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,800
Life - has no point.

606
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Life has no point.

607
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,200
this script has no point

608
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,400
it's awful, so bad.

609
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,600
Hey!

610
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
God, don't you ever wear clothes?

611
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Maybe if you called first I wouldn't
be stuck.

612
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,200
Now I have to put something nice on.

613
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,400
Wait, can you give this to Cameron?

614
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
Do you think you could
take a look at this?

615
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,800
Oh God, don't tell me you're a
screenwriter too?

616
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
If you could just have a look,
I won't tell, for Cameron.

617
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,200
If I have time,
Ok?

618
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,400
Love that blouse.

619
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,600
Hi there.

620
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,800
How did you get through the gate?

621
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I know your secret.

622
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,200
I know everything.

623
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,400
How long did you think the two of you could
keep something like this from me?

624
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,600
Not long, I guess.

625
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,800
You can invite me in?

626
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
and uh,

627
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,200
we could talk about it.

628
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,400
I hope you understand that you
can't write this story.

629
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,600
It's too big to sit on it.

630
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,800
"Cameron Hunter agrees to Space Buddies 2."

631
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
But you can't

632
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,200
write

633
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,400
Oh, the big sequel.

634
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,600
Yeah, but you see, it hasn't

635
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,800
officially been signed yet.

636
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
A little bird told me you signed a deal
with Kaufman.

637
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,200
Lisa, you can't print this story yet.

638
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
and what do I get for not printing it?

639
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,600
I uh, what do you want?

640
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,800
You know what I want.

641
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh, fuck, holy, holy

642
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,200
Karen, Karen!

643
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,400
Get out of the way!

644
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,600
Friend of yours?

645
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
You have to leave.

646
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Now, this interview is over.

647
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,200
So uh, I can run the story then.

648
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,400
No. Please just leave me alone.

649
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,600
What are you doing here?

650
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,800
Karen, I know this is gonna sound dumb,
but will you please let me explain.

651
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I have a better idea. Why don't I close
the door and you go away.

652
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
I can't. I don't have anywhere to go to.

653
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,400
Come in.

654
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,600
You mean everything to me.

655
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,800
You're a better actor than I thought.

656
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I'm serious.

657
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,200
Listen, that reporter wanted to write
a story about me

658
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,400
and I didn't want her to write it.

659
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,600
I tried to be nice to her

660
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,800
but she took it the wrong way.

661
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
and?

662
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,200
I've been reading your letters

663
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,400
I mean, re-reading them.

664
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,600
and it's amazing.

665
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
I mean, the way that you
are about acting.

666
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
and talk about life.

667
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
It's like I always had those feelings

668
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,400
but didn't have the words for them.

669
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,600
I've never met a woman like you before.

670
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,800
Do you mean that?

671
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Of course I do.

672
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,200
Do you think

673
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,400
maybe we could

674
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,600
go back to the way that we were?

675
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
well, it...

676
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
well, we could get something
to eat and talk about it.

677
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,200
Coming!

678
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,400
Well, hello there.

679
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,600
Jesus you're dangling.

680
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,800
Come on, I was just taking a nap

681
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
and just rubbing my shoulder,
Come on in.

682
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,200
Um, I had a look at, to see your script

683
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,400
Aw, thanks.

684
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,600
So, what did you think?

685
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,800
You wrote that in a week?
- Yeah.

686
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
You came up with all those characters,
and the house and a plot,

687
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,200
and all of this
in a week?

688
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,400
yeah, does it show?

689
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,600
It's amazing.

690
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
It's the smartest thing I've read in months.

691
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
great!

692
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,200
You know, I tried to write there was
something there but I wasn't sure, so

693
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,400
I really appreciate this

694
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,600
Oh, you're welcome.

695
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,800
So

696
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You know what, I know you think
I'm a hard ass.

697
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,200
Come on.

698
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,400
No, it's ok,
I don't mind it.

699
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,800
I take my work seriously.

700
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and that scares guys off sometimes.

701
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,200
But when I'm not at work

702
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,400
I can be just as playful as any girl.

703
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,600
Um, I'm sure you can.

704
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,800
and,

705
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I know that I'm not usual for you

706
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,200
so um,

707
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,400
I hope you don't mind me asking

708
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,600
are you doing anything tonight?

709
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,800
You know, like I say, I was just
working this knot out of my shoulder.

710
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Right.

711
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,200
Well, um,

712
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,400
do you need any help?

713
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,600
I hope you like this place
I know its a surprise.

714
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,800
No, it's fine.

715
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
What are you looking at
me like that for?

716
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,200
You are so beautiful.

717
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,400
I don't know if I can ever get enough.

718
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,600
So, tell me about the theatre.

719
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,800
Nah, you don't want to hear about it.

720
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
No, I do, I do, really.

721
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,200
yeah?

722
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,400
ok.

723
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,600
Well, this fall we're gonna have, um

724
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,800
Ibsen.

725
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
and I'm gonna direct.

726
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,200
and

727
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,500
open this whole Mamet series

728
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,600
It's gonna be great.

729
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,800
You should come and see it

730
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I really miss working in theatre,
it's the best

731
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,200
I mean, working with people in their craft

732
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,400
and watching people make a connection
with an audience

733
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,600
What do you know about real theatre?

734
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,800
Oh, I've done a lot.

735
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I mean it was

736
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,200
it was before I met you though.

737
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,400
You never told me that.

738
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,600
You know, you never talk about yourself.

739
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,800
why are you being so honest now?

740
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I think it's you.

741
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,200
something about you makes me

742
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,400
want to be better.

743
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,600
Cameron

744
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,800
that is the sweetest thing you've
ever said to me.

745
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Ah, hold on to that.

746
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,200
Now,

747
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,400
If the old Cameron comes back

748
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,600
you still have to like him.

749
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,800
Why would the old Cameron come back?

750
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I'm just saying hypothetical if he did,
but it didn't sound right

751
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,200
and you want to be around Cameron

752
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,400
Make love to me.

753
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,600
You know that wouldn't be a bad idea, but

754
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,800
Have you ever got naked and made love to me?

755
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You have never made love to me
like that before.

756
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,200
Was it ok?

757
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,400
Of course, it was wonderful.

758
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,600
Where did you learn that,
thing with your hips you do?

759
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,800
Oh, I just made that up

760
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Well, that may be a first for us after all.

761
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,200
It is really.
- Yeah?

762
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,400
Do you, do you love me?

763
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,600
I mean, more than the old Cameron?

764
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:03,800
yes, I do.

765
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Would you love me if I wasn't
rich and famous?

766
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,300
Of course I would.

767
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,500
It's on the inside that's what counts.

768
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:17,700
you know that.

769
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:24,900
I'm gonna take a shower

770
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,100
then I'm going to make us some breakfast.

771
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,300
so nice.

772
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,500
Jesus.

773
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:08,700
Tim

774
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:09,900
what?

775
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:14,100
you can't do this.

776
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,300
do what?

777
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,500
falling in love with Karen.

778
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,700
Maybe all this was supposed to happen.

779
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:25,900
I mean, she's unlike any girl I've ever
met before.

780
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,100
but

781
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,300
you made a promise to Cameron

782
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,500
that you would

783
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,700
leave his life the way you found it.

784
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,900
How would Karen feel if she found out

785
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:37,100
that you were some other guy
who's been misleading her?

786
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,300
She's not yours, Tim.

787
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,500
I guess you're right.

788
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,700
Listen will you do me a favour?

789
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,900
Would you tell Karen

790
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,100
I had to go out of town, on
an emergency. or something

791
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,300
Cameron will be back in a few days,

792
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,500
and everything will be Ok.

793
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,700
and I guess I'll just

794
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,900
live my life.

795
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,100
Sorry Tim.

796
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,300
Yeah this is Lou.

797
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,500
Lou, I feel like I’m 90 here.

798
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,700
Cameron.

799
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,900
Hey I got the feeling this is absolutely

800
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,100
the best contract with Kaufman

801
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,300
what?

802
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:37,500
I think it's crazy on the news already

803
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:44,700
Cameron.

804
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,900
Lou. hold on. I'll be right back

805
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,800
I am not believing this thing about you.

806
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,200
me too.

807
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,400
I thought you were going to be leaving town?

808
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,600
I was, but I'm back.

809
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,800
you know I've got Lou on the phone.

810
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
but I'll deal with that later

811
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,200
right now I want to take you upstairs.

812
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,400
do that thing you do.

813
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,600
what?

814
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,800
that thing that you do with your hips

815
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
You know what I mean.

816
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,200
Come on, don't tease me.

817
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,400
Oh, you know what, I just forgot,
be right back, I'll do it.

818
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,600
Lou

819
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,800
yeah, Lou Sperling

820
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Lou, hey, Les is still on the old time,
right?

821
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,200
Jesus, Cameron, listen, I got Kaufman
on the other line.

822
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,400
You can't say no.

823
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,600
Perfect, great. Come over in the morning
with the contract, we'll sign, alright?

824
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:29,800
Cameron

825
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
are you coming back to bed?

826
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:46,200
OK, does someone want to tell me
what is going on?

827
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,400
Alright, I can explain.

828
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,600
Maybe I should. It might be easiest.

829
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,800
Well, I just want to know how

830
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I just want to know how long
this has been going on?

831
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,200
and which one of you have I been
sleeping with?

832
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,400
Who is responsible for this prank?

833
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,600
Well?

834
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,800
Are you not going to speak?

835
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
You slept with my girl?

836
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,200
I didn't mean to.

837
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,400
It was her idea.

838
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,600
I didn't want to blow your cover.

839
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,800
Well, you better go and explain it.

840
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I think I've done enough already.

841
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,200
I don't want to go.

842
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,400
Hi Karen.

843
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,600
It's uh,

844
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,800
I guess we haven't been properly introduced.

845
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
My name is Tim

846
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,200
I'm sorry about this.

847
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,400
Please don't blame Cameron.

848
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,600
It wasn't his fault.

849
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,800
I had no business doing what we did.

850
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
No, you didn't.

851
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,200
Well, the thing is, just

852
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,400
well, I, fell in love with you.

853
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,600
You know it's a pretty easy thing to do.

854
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,800
and you're beautiful.

855
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
smart.

856
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,200
kind.

857
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,400
You're wonderful, you know.

858
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,600
Everything I said last night was true.

859
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,800
That was you?

860
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
You know I started imagining what my life
would be like with a girl like you in it.

861
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,200
and I liked it.

862
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,400
But then I realized I didn't deserve you.

863
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,600
not after lying to you the way I did.

864
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,800
So I just came up to tell you I'm sorry.

865
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
and goodbye.

866
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,200
Baby!

867
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,400
It's me.

868
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,600
It's the real me.

869
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,800
Aw, baby you're not going
to be mad at me, are you?

870
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Come on.

871
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,200
I didn't mean for you to find out.

872
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,400
You know what? I really liked it
while I was gone.

873
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,600
I know it's a lot for you to advance your
career and everything but

874
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,800
honey, we could find a way for
you to fit in.

875
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
what do you say?

876
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,200
I say you both get out of here.

877
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,400
why should I leave for a loser?

878
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,600
You know, I fell in love with a man.

879
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,800
and I'm not going to throw that all away

880
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
just because of some stupid prank.

881
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:24,200
That's right

882
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,400
Right

883
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,700
This is the man I fell in love with.

884
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,900
Wait a minute, that's not me, I'm me.

885
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,100
And I'm me Cameron.

886
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:50,300
You have to accept that we're
never gonna change.

887
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,500
what do you mean?

888
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,700
I don't belong here.

889
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:56,900
I'm sorry.

890
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:02,100
Come with me.

891
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:23,300
I'm going to have to work in Portland

892
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
are you coming with me?

893
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:29,700
You want me to come?

894
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:32,900
Well, you're obviously a good actor.

895
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:35,100
the regional theatre could use an
actor like you.

896
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,300
I could, too.

897
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,500
I just, just, this matter with Cameron.

898
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,700
Well, Cameron and I have obviously
outgrown each other.

899
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,100
I'll miss this.

900
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:50,300
I'll be Ok.

901
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,500
Yeah, what about Cameron?

902
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,700
He'll be Ok too.

903
01:36:58,900 --> 01:36:59,900
He's Cameron Hunter.
