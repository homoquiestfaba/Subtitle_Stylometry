[tense music]

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Mom!

4
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,410
Jaden!

5
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,750
[Jaden] Mom!

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,030
Mom!

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,070
[dark music]

8
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,310
Jaden!

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,140
[Jaden] Mom!

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,340
- Jaden!
- Mom!

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,650
Jaden!

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,000
- Jaden.
- Mom!

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,170
Jaden.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,370
Jaden!

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,580
Help!

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Jaden!

17
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,750
[gasping]

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,510
Babe.

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,820
You all right baby?

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,340
Yeah,

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,820
I'm fine, sorry.

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,030
- That's the third
nightmare this week.

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,030
The masked man took Jaden.

24
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,650
So it was the same man?

25
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,410
Well, babe, I don't
know what to do, man.

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,610
Cause it's getting worse.

27
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,380
I had my son taken from me.

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,650
It doesn't get better.

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,340
You mean our son?

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,130
Okay, I was messed
up about it too.

31
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,690
We got him back.

32
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,480
- [Clarisse] You
were out of town?

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,790
Yeah, I was out of town,

34
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,440
working, so I can provide
all of this for you.

35
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,370
Right?

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,450
I forgot I'm supposed
to thank you.

37
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,750
Risse, babe.

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,310
Risse, come on.

39
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,790
You know that's
not what I meant.

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,380
It's what you said.

41
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,100
[soft music]

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,450
Good night.

43
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,860
[soft music continues]

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,820
[gentle music]

45
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,690
- In this upscale
area of Phoenix,

46
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,550
the FBI is investigating
a bank robbery

47
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,790
and the subsequent murders

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,690
of the bank vice
president and his wife.

49
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,380
We've just learned from sources

50
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,650
that both husband and wife
have been brutally murdered.

51
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,830
Husband and wife.

52
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,550
That's scary.

53
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,910
Probably some drugs involved.

54
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,690
You know, some money
laundering and shit.

55
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,550
Some freaky sex
games or something.

56
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,860
People just don't get
killed randomly, baby.

57
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,340
You don't know that.

58
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
Yeah, I do.

59
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,830
It's called karma.

60
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,310
You get what you
got coming to you.

61
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,650
I don't believe in karma.

62
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,550
Anyway, the food's ready.

63
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,866
When you come late to the table,

64
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,340
the kids think
they can do it too.

65
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,070
What's up, baby?

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,760
Give me like five more minutes,

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,340
plus I'm here trying to
look good for you anyway.

68
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,516
You want me to stop, why
don't you come gimme a kiss?

69
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,310
No, you'll taste sweaty.

70
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,370
Sweat tastes good.

71
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,650
Where is everybody?

72
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,650
Watch this.

73
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,380
Allie, breakfast
is on the table.

74
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,720
Five more minutes.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,380
The food is hot now

76
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,460
and I asked you not to
come outside in your bra.

77
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,890
Mom, it's a workout top.

78
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,270
And who's gonna see me?

79
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,860
- I see you and I'm
asking you to change.

80
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,370
- Boo.
[gasping]

81
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
- Jaden, why do you
insist on these games?

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
It's fun.

83
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,410
[fire alarm beeping]

84
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,790
Fire truck.

85
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,690
- Ooh ooh ooh.
- Oh, crap, not again.

86
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,240
Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,620
[beeping]

88
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,310
Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

89
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,410
Oh.

90
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,000
[Jaden] Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

91
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Nice.

93
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,050
We could have a nice morning

94
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,520
if I didn't have to
chase everybody around.

95
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,790
It's disrespectful.

96
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,480
- Baby, nobody's
disrespecting you.

97
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

98
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,060
[Clarisse] Jaden, stop.

99
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,000
Come on, relax.

100
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,270
You just having fun, ain't
that right little man.

101
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,790
- He can have fun and
still listen to me.

102
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,726
- Jaden, all right,
that's enough, man.

103
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,480
Come on, eat your waffles.

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,480
Oh my God.

105
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,310
Every day.

106
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,450
Come on, we're gonna be late

107
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,000
and I can't get another tardy.

108
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,690
I'm coming, we'll

109
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,890
make it.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,450
You are not wearing
that to school.

111
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,960
You're ridiculous.

112
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,070
You make us move out here.

113
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,720
I never see my friends,

114
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,960
and now I can't even wear this.

115
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,690
- Your mouth is
getting ridiculous.

116
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,860
I'm the mother here.

117
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,070
You're not even my real mom.

118
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,650
[soft music]

119
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,000
- Like it or not, I've been
your mother since you were two.

120
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,650
Whatever.

121
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,410
You wanna hide from life,
that is your problem.

122
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,610
It's not mine.

123
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,510
[sad music]

124
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,520
I, I'm walking to the garage

125
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
and this masked man,
he jumps into the car

126
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,960
and takes off with Jaden.

127
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,070
That's that vulnerability.

128
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,440
Fear of strange places,
fear of strangers.

129
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,410
And I'm tired of it.

130
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,610
Good.

131
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,060
- I always feel so scattered
after these dreams.

132
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,100
Allie yelled at me.

133
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,830
Why did she yell at you?

134
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,200
She had a half shirt on.

135
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,750
I told her to change it.

136
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
She said, I made them
move from the city.

137
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
I,

138
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,830
She made it a point to tell
me that I'm not her real mom.

139
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,510
She's 16 years old.

140
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,510
Most girls that age are
always raging at their moms.

141
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,860
- I've been her
mom for 14 years.

142
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,060
She knows that.

143
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,520
And so do you.

144
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,130
To never know her biological
mom, it hurts her.

145
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
Yeah, I know.

146
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,860
Still it's like a
knife in my chest

147
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,100
when she says I'm
not her real mom.

148
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
She's a teenager.

149
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,510
She wants to hurt you.

150
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,930
So what about Walt?

151
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
The sex?

152
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,620
He's busy.

153
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Everything's fine.

154
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,650
Is it?

155
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,690
- What does everyone
want from me?

156
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,720
I had my son taken from me

157
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,130
and I am dealing with
that the best I can.

158
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,930
- That was six years ago,
and you got him back.

159
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,240
- Are you saying my fear has
a statute of limitations?

160
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,790
No, I'm not.

161
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,620
What I'm saying is we have
to work on letting go.

162
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
You know this.

163
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Letting go.

164
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,100
My son was stolen from me.

165
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,760
I'm not letting
that happen again.

166
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,200
So if people think I'm too
intense, then so be it.

167
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,580
[soft music]

168
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,580
[Sandy] Hi Clarisse.

169
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Hey.

170
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,030
I'm back.

171
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,936
- You know, you
have support here.

172
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I know.

173
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,900
Thanks.

174
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,200
- See you later.
- Yeah.

175
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,580
Morning, Doris.

176
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,580
Good morning, Clarisse.

177
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,780
This is Lauren.

178
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
Welcome Lauren.

179
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,170
Hey Clarisse.

180
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,620
Thanks for doing
all of this for us.

181
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,100
Of course.

182
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,830
- So I was just
explaining to Lauren

183
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,720
about our
confidentiality policy,

184
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,206
how we're not
allowed to let anyone

185
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,270
know that she's actually here.

186
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,860
However, we do recommend

187
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,030
that you let the authorities
know about these incidents.

188
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,930
No, no cops.

189
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,000
I just need things to calm down.

190
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
You know,

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,900
my man is a good guy.

192
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,340
It's just he was upset and.

193
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,340
Shit, you know, he just
gotta, he has his moments.

194
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,720
No, that's your prerogative.

195
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,386
We're only gonna talk
about the options

196
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,820
that we have available to you.

197
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,830
Doris, we have a situation.

198
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,030
We need you.

199
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,060
[Doris] Oh God, okay.

200
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,310
- She just, she just
barged in yelling for help.

201
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,270
I saw the blood.

202
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,900
So I came to get you guys.

203
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,240
- Call an ambulance.
- No.

204
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,830
No doctors.

205
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,720
No Cops, he'll.

206
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,100
He'll find me that way.

207
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,516
- Sandy, Get me
the first aid kit.

208
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,750
[Sandy] Okay.

209
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,210
Oh God.

210
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,030
I'm so sorry about all
the blood on the floor.

211
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,790
The floor can be washed.

212
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,270
We need to get you cleaned up.

213
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,270
- I punched my hand
through the window

214
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,310
to smash his fucking
face in and I,

215
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,720
goddammit, I missed.

216
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,000
Where's that first aid kit?

217
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Coming, I have it.

218
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,310
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

219
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,790
[soft music]

220
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,000
God, it's gonna sting.

221
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,270
[Doris] Hold still.

222
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,470
Um,

223
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,340
do you think I could maybe
stay here a little while?

224
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,720
Of course.

225
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
This is your safe place.

226
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
This is home.

227
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,030
I've always wanted a home.

228
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,790
- And we'll keep
the boogeyman away.

229
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, right.

230
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
What's so funny?

231
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,860
- My guy would kick
the boogie man's ass.

232
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,370
[dark music]

233
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,720
[dark music continues]

234
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Feel better.

235
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,760
I feel safe.

236
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,170
Cuts and bruises, I'm used to.

237
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,540
- Apparently, you and
me sing the same song.

238
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,930
My name's Clarisse,

239
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,340
and today's topic is hope.

240
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,240
Cherry, why don't you
introduce yourself

241
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,240
and tell us, if
you care to share,

242
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,100
the situation that
brought you here.

243
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,410
I'm Cherry Redvine.

244
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,930
My boyfriend Billy
calls me Blossom,

245
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,550
and I got lots of
reasons to be here.

246
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,340
Why are you here, Clarisse?

247
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,310
I'm the group facilitator.

248
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,830
Yeah, no shit.

249
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,030
I get that.

250
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,060
But do you have
problems with your man?

251
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,270
- I've been married
for 14 years.

252
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,960
Walt's great.

253
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,370
- Oh, does Walt
hit you or did he?

254
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,340
Did a old boyfriend used to?

255
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,170
No.

256
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,480
Wow.

257
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,380
Well, congratulations

258
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,580
on a normy husband
and a perfect life.

259
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,860
Just wow.

260
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,340
But if you don't have any
experience with bad boys,

261
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,170
then how the fuck are
you gonna help us?

262
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,270
Learned experience.

263
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,210
I'm completing my masters.

264
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,480
Oh, so we're test subjects.

265
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,030
Hey, can you just lay off?

266
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,550
Okay, Clarisse seems like
a really nice person.

267
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,556
I don't know why you're
giving her a crap, bitch.

268
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,340
[Cherry] Bitch?

269
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,930
Yeah, you heard me,

270
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,550
bitch.

271
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,520
Yeah, bitch.

272
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,930
I wanna share too.

273
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,380
We all got issues.

274
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,520
- What the, what the
fuck is going on?

275
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,340
Hey.

276
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,170
Oh, okay.

277
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,370
Ladies, uhuh.

278
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,550
No names.

279
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,650
Okay.

280
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I mean,

281
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,930
don't you ever
wanna live a little?

282
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,130
Excuse me?

283
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,170
One man,

284
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,370
14 years of the same dick.

285
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,030
Now that is safe.

286
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,620
[ladies giggling]

287
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,030
Cheers.

288
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,930
[ladies giggling]

289
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,550
Hey,

290
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,240
guys, be careful.

291
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,030
[ominous music]

292
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,520
I met an interesting
woman today.

293
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,750
She was spunky,

294
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,620
kind of charming,

295
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,000
self-confident,

296
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
angry,

297
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,370
not like the others.

298
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,130
Haven't been able
to place her yet.

299
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,370
Baby, you're spunky.

300
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Very charming.

301
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
Sexy as hell.

302
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,000
- Moi?
- Yeah.

303
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,930
Sexy?

304
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,130
[Walt] Yeah.

305
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Talking about you.

306
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,510
God dammit.

307
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,140
When are the
painters coming back?

308
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,000
- Next week, baby,
they'll finish it.

309
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,480
Can we finish the sexy?

310
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Next week.

311
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,650
When are things gonna get
back to normal around here?

312
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,680
Soon I hope.

313
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,620
- I'm sorry for putting you
on the spot the other day.

314
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,030
I'm in a bad place.

315
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,650
Things will turn around.

316
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,850
Yeah.

317
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,410
Just like my daddy
always used to say.

318
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,030
Just keep looking
on the bright side.

319
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,410
There you go.

320
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,440
- He was an alcoholic who
died of violent death.

321
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,480
So yeah, he was always looking
on the bright side of things.

322
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm so sorry, Cherry.

323
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,340
Sometimes the people
closest to us,

324
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,310
they hurt us the most.

325
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,510
Yeah.

326
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,270
My daddy hurt us.

327
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
He

328
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,750
Beat my mom so bad once
she got blood on the brain,

329
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,580
she died a week later.

330
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,270
I'm so sorry.

331
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,170
Don't be.

332
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,550
Motherfucker went to prison, and

333
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,750
when he got out,

334
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,100
he got knifed right
outside of a bar.

335
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
That's karma for you.

336
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,860
Fucking monsters
deserve to be destroyed.

337
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,370
- Yeah, but sometimes people
do have the capacity to change.

338
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,240
- Yeah, and you didn't
fucking know him.

339
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,790
- Do you have
something against me?

340
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,210
Yeah, actually I do.

341
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,720
Why?

342
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
I don't know.

343
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,790
Women like you annoy
the shit outta me.

344
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,790
Life is just, just
passing you by.

345
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,210
You're just coasting.

346
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,450
I mean, nothing is,
is, is challenging.

347
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,680
Okay, strong women

348
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,380
are not born with a silver
spoon in their mouth.

349
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,820
You don't know me like that.

350
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,210
Hey.

351
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,680
Wanda needs to use the office.

352
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,440
Come on, Cherry, let's go.

353
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,680
[soft music]

354
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,380
This is fucking bullshit.

355
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,830
You let 'em kick you
out of your own office.

356
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,860
It's not my office.

357
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,890
I'm working on my
credential hours.

358
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,960
- You let them
dictate who you are.

359
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,860
Who are you, Clarisse?

360
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,650
What are your secrets?

361
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,170
My secrets.

362
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,440
My son Jaden is
borderline autistic.

363
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,520
Six years ago I was coming
from the dry cleaners

364
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,960
and Jaden was in the back seat.

365
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,170
I went to take the clothes
inside of the car and

366
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,480
my SUV was jacked.

367
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,790
Just like that.

368
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,310
The next few hours
were terrifying.

369
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,650
Later that day,

370
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,960
they found my car and luckily
Jaden was still inside.

371
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,860
They never found the
man who took my baby.

372
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,270
You were traumatized?

373
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,650
Oh, I was a train wreck.

374
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,000
I couldn't be separated
from Allie or Jaden.

375
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,750
I still can't.

376
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,680
Then the nightmares started.

377
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,820
You still have those?

378
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,790
Yeah.

379
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,930
- And this happened
six years ago?

380
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,130
Six years ago.

381
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,580
- My trauma happens
fucking daily.

382
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,930
- Cherry.
- Fuck.

383
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,550
- I'm not comparing my
trauma to your trauma.

384
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,930
Trauma is still trauma,

385
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,860
no matter the
perspective or privilege,

386
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,550
you have to be open to change.

387
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,370
You have to learn
to trust others.

388
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Honestly,

389
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,650
from the moment I
met you, Clarisse,

390
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,440
I said to myself,

391
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,650
this person is gonna
be good for me.

392
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,480
- Not everybody is out
to get you, Cherry.

393
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,550
Ditto, Clarisse.

394
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Ditto.

395
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,380
[gentle music]

396
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,000
[ominous music]

397
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,340
[ominous music continues]

398
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Hey.

399
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,340
You seem so distracted lately.

400
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,060
You know, you can
tell me anything.

401
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,060
- You don't need to
worry about that.

402
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,620
[ominous music]

403
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,620
[ominous music continues]

404
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,890
You're late.

405
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,510
Got a new client,

406
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,550
so we went out for drinks.

407
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,860
- I've asked you to call me
so I don't sit here worrying.

408
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
You know my mind races
when I don't hear from you.

409
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,760
Sorry.

410
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
I apologize.

411
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,480
You smell like beer

412
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
and perfume.

413
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,520
Baby, I was at the Highland.

414
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,520
I was crowded, okay.

415
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,030
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,230
I'll take a shower.

417
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,960
I thought about you today.

418
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,440
About us,

419
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,030
and,

420
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,130
I just want you to know
I'm thinking about it.

421
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,620
Okay.

422
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,940
I'm gonna, I'm gonna shower.

423
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,790
[dark music]

424
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,480
Don't move

425
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,930
or your fucking dead.

426
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,690
Shut up.

427
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,720
I slice your throat open
right here, you little bitch.

428
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
Now you tell Cherry

429
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,790
Billy says hello.

430
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,790
[emotional music]

431
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,930
Hey, what happened?

432
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,130
Billy.

433
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,650
He threatened me.

434
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
He was gonna cut me up.

435
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Billy?

436
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,850
Your Billy.

437
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,650
He's a fucking psycho.

438
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
He knows you're here.

439
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,520
He's gonna kill
you in your sleep.

440
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,790
He's evil.

441
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Shit.

442
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,000
Fuck.

443
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
He knows where I am?

444
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,720
Look, I'm,

445
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,100
I'm safer at home.

446
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,520
I, I gotta get outta here.

447
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
But

448
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,620
he's gonna kill you.

449
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,270
[uneasy music]

450
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,310
[uneasy music continues]

451
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Clarisse.

452
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,790
Cherry's gone.

453
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,990
Lauren left too.

454
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
What happened?

455
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,550
- Cherry's boyfriend
threatened Lauren.

456
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,000
He said he was gonna kill her.

457
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,000
[uneasy music]

458
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Billy found her?

459
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,650
Yeah.

460
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,240
We called the
sheriff right away.

461
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,890
She gave Doris this note.

462
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,310
[sad music]

463
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,340
- Thanks for your
help, Clarisse.

464
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,210
I'll miss you.

465
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,720
Your friend, Cherry.

466
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,650
- Hey, you really connected
with her, Clarisse.

467
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,340
That's all we can really do.

468
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,410
Yeah.

469
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,410
[sad music continues]

470
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,960
[sad music continues]

471
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,790
[sad music continues]

472
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,620
Hey.

473
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,100
Babe, what's wrong?

474
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,720
I can see you shaking.

475
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,100
Ah.

476
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,960
The girl,

477
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,930
Cherry that I was helping,

478
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,130
she left the shelter.

479
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,170
Oh.

480
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,030
Why she leave?

481
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
I don't know.

482
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,170
It's complicated.

483
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,370
- I mean, isn't this kind
of thing expected though?

484
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,270
The girl is unstable.

485
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,860
Baby, I mean, those
women are so traumatized.

486
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,340
Sure they have all types
of mental issues and stuff.

487
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,210
Cherry thanked me.

488
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,410
She said I helped her.

489
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,790
Good.

490
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
You did good, baby.

491
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,000
You brought some light
into this crazy world.

492
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,930
I really don't know anymore.

493
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,340
Come on.

494
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,540
Come on.

495
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,480
I need you to get ready.

496
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
Remember,

497
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,340
I got that business
launching I told you about.

498
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,100
All my wealthiest clients
are gonna be there, baby.

499
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,270
It's gonna be very
important for us.

500
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,470
So, come on, I need you.

501
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,890
Give me a minute.

502
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,960
Okay.

503
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Get ready though.

504
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,480
[soft music]

505
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,030
So how do I look?

506
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:26,930
Good.

507
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,410
I bet she won't go.

508
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,790
- Don't say that 'cause
she's really doing good.

509
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,270
- Look, Mom, I can
do the crabwalk.

510
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,140
- No, Jaden, don't.
[heel snapping]

511
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,760
Dammit.

512
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
You're all right, baby?

513
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,790
I don't wanna go.

514
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,960
No, babe.

515
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,960
You can just go get
another pair of shoes.

516
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,860
- I don't have another pair
of shoes to match this dress.

517
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,790
Mom, I have shoes.

518
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,240
They're not my style.

519
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,140
I don't wanna go.

520
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,790
- No, no, no, baby, just
go get another dress.

521
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,860
- Kids, can you give
your dad and I a second?

522
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,890
Listen,

523
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,410
babe,

524
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,070
I already told you how
important this is for us.

525
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,510
Okay, look, I need
you by my side.

526
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,510
- We don't even
have a babysitter.

527
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,380
Allie's 16.

528
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,790
She can handle it.

529
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,960
Jaden's a handful.

530
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,030
You can go.

531
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,440
Please, just be understanding.

532
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,930
- I've been fucking
understanding.

533
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,130
All right.

534
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,340
And I've been patient.

535
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,930
I'm sick of this shit.

536
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,370
[sad music]

537
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,170
I am not helping anybody,

538
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,930
and I'm not getting better.

539
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,340
I am actually scared.

540
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,480
And what are you scared of?

541
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
Every damn thing.

542
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,000
My family has no faith in me.

543
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,550
You know, I'm supposed
to be the strong one,

544
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,580
but I'm the one who
needs all the babying.

545
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,340
Clarisse, you're putting

546
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,070
way too much
pressure on yourself.

547
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,960
You're a mother, you're a
wife, you're a therapist.

548
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
You are enough.

549
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,170
Actually, I'm not.

550
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,370
I'm not.

551
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,620
Walt is uh,

552
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,680
Walt's going to leave me.

553
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,410
I bailed on his business
lunch a few hours ago.

554
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,240
Why did you bail?

555
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,650
- Like I said, I am
scared of everything.

556
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,100
My heel broke.

557
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,030
We had no babysitter.

558
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,130
I panicked.

559
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,550
Walt loves you,

560
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,930
no matter how difficult it
is to navigate this trauma,

561
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,580
Walt loves you.

562
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
You know that.

563
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,930
Some nights he comes home

564
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,370
smelling like
alcohol and perfume.

565
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,650
He says he's networking,
but I'm not stupid.

566
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
I know there's someone,

567
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,930
but I can't confront him.

568
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,170
What if he leaves?

569
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,550
- All right, try and
look at this big picture.

570
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,650
You're afraid Walt
is going to leave,

571
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,520
yet by being weak, you
are pushing him away.

572
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,060
Assertiveness is a very
attractive state, Clarisse.

573
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,130
You have to find the
warrior within you.

574
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,410
[soft music]

575
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,610
I can't.

576
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,510
Yes, you can.

577
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,130
We have to find something
in you to make that happen.

578
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,580
[soft music continues]

579
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,270
Hey, you forgot your backpack.

580
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,340
[playful music]

581
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,170
- [Allie] Give me
back my phone, jerk.

582
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,480
Jaden not in the parking lot.

583
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,480
I'll kill you.

584
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,480
He's just teasing you.

585
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,000
She's gotta crush on Jami.

586
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,000
Okay, enough, both of you.

587
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,620
- Hey, Jaden,
what's on your shoe?

588
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Gotcha.

589
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,170
There you go.

590
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,070
Thanks.

591
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,270
Why don't you kiss her.

592
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Jaden.

593
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,750
I'll kill him.

594
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,240
He's just a kid.

595
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,820
Everything seems funny to him.

596
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,550
All right, I'll
see you guys later.

597
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,340
Bye.

598
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,650
Excuse me, sir.

599
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,070
Hi.

600
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,726
I'm desperate to scrap
together some funds

601
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,520
for a bus trip home.

602
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,340
I really don't need much.

603
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
Cherry?

604
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,170
Hey.

605
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,240
Hey, Clarisse.

606
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,550
Funny running into you
at my place of business.

607
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,866
[Clarisse] How are you doing?

608
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:37,890
Who's this?

609
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,580
This is my friend, Cherry.

610
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,550
Cherry, this is my
daughter, Allie.

611
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,210
And that's Jaden over there.

612
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,410
Hey guys.

613
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,170
See you got a feisty one here.

614
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,340
God, I'm, I'm so embarrassed
that you had to see me begging.

615
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,030
You could have asked me.

616
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,860
You wanna be my sugar daddy?

617
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,450
I, I'm really just trying
the scrape together

618
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,650
a hundred bucks for a bus ticket
to go back to Mississippi.

619
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,480
That's where my sister lives.

620
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,370
Mom, come on, let's go.

621
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
I'm so sorry.

622
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,430
Thank you for trying to help.

623
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,140
Take it.

624
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,340
- Here.
- No.

625
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,550
Keep it.

626
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,510
- I will mail you the
money back, I promise.

627
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,270
Thank you.

628
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,890
Bye, bye guys.

629
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,380
[Walt] Oh man.

630
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,620
You're so silly.

631
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,760
- Oh boy.
- This looks good.

632
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,620
[Walt] Gimme one.

633
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,620
I want a piece.

634
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,020
[Clarisse] Yeah, [indistinct].

635
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,930
So guess what.

636
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,930
[Clarisse] What?

637
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,140
I got a B on my math test

638
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,480
and Mr. Reeves said
if I keep it up,

639
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,240
I'll be in advanced
placement classes next year.

640
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,580
A B?

641
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,270
I thought you said you
studied for that test.

642
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,720
I did.

643
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,620
Not enough, you can do better.

644
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,380
Come on.

645
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,480
I think advanced placement will
be good for you young lady.

646
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,170
You know, another
challenge, right?

647
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,440
- Mom gave a hobo
a hundred bucks.

648
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,520
Jaden.

649
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,240
What, what?

650
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,830
- She's not a hobo and that's
not a good word to use.

651
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,520
She's struggling.

652
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,820
- Huh?
- Yeah.

653
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,170
A struggling hobo.

654
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,140
Allie.

655
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,380
[family laughing]

656
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,580
Allie, stop it.

657
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,790
Let's say grace.

658
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,380
All right, when,

659
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,270
Lord, thank you for our food.

660
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,450
Thank you for our family
and for our blessings, Amen.

661
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,650
- Amen.
- Amen.

662
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,370
Amen.

663
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,550
It was Cherry.

664
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,340
- You mean the woman
from the shelter?

665
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,480
- She has a sister
in Mississippi.

666
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,860
She wants to go there
for a fresh start.

667
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,450
Okay.

668
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,416
I guess it was nice that
you was able to help her

669
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,890
with some cash then, right?

670
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,900
I wish I could do more.

671
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,960
She seems like she has
a ton of potential.

672
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,620
Mom, she was manipulating you.

673
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,860
She's a user and
she got your money.

674
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,720
Mm.

675
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,930
Allie no.

676
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,240
No, you have to
learn to trust people

677
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,270
and see their good sides.

678
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,550
If they have a good side.

679
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,620
[Walt laughing]

680
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,650
Don't do your mama like that.

681
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,930
Hey, excuse me, sir.

682
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,570
Look, I'm desperate
for a bus ticket.

683
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,340
I, I, I really, I just.

684
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,340
Hey, just help a girl out.

685
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,000
Hey.

686
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,550
Are you kidding?

687
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,310
Look at me.

688
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,510
Come on.

689
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,340
Just look at, a little.

690
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Come on, fuck.

691
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,830
Really?

692
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,000
[dark music]

693
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,650
Hey Blossom.

694
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,240
You miss me?

695
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,960
[dark music continues]
[Cherry groaning]

696
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,790
No.

697
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,370
[dark music continues]
[Cherry groaning]

698
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
I missed you,

699
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
Blossom.

700
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,380
[horn honking]

701
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,930
[uneasy music]

702
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,060
[Billy coughing]

703
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,620
You're never going
to get away from me.

704
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,030
Amy,

705
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,550
can I talk to you for a second?

706
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,650
Yes, Walt?

707
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,480
I can't do this anymore.

708
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,930
No one will ever know.

709
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,130
Trust me.

710
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I do trust you.

711
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,830
Amy, you're amazing.

712
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,680
I just, I can't do this anymore.

713
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,340
But it's our secret.

714
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
I promise.

715
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,510
It's wrong.

716
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,860
I'm a married man.

717
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,380
- You were married
when this started.

718
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,000
Do you want me to
tell her about us?

719
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,626
- If you feel that's
what you need to do, Amy,

720
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,650
you go right ahead.

721
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,620
But my wife is going through
a very difficult time,

722
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,130
and what we're doing,

723
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,130
I'm only making it worse.

724
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,000
So if you feel you need
to tell her, you do that,

725
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,820
I just hope we can still
make it through counseling.

726
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,620
I don't wanna hurt you, Walt.

727
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,480
I don't wanna hurt you either.

728
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,720
You really think I'm amazing?

729
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,370
[soft music]

730
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,060
You know I do.

731
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,790
He's fast, right?

732
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,620
Yeah.

733
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,790
[doorbell ringing]

734
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,990
Coming.

735
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Cherry?

736
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,820
Can you help me?

737
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,170
Oh my gosh, come on.

738
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,750
Thank you.

739
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
She's bleeding.

740
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,480
Jaden, get the bandages.

741
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,450
[Jaden] Bandages?

742
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,440
Yes, bandages.

743
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,060
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.

744
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,480
Oh my God.

745
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,930
I'm so sorry, Clarisse.

746
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,790
I had know where else to go.

747
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,990
Aha.

748
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,450
- We've gotta get
you to a hospital.

749
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,690
No.

750
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,890
No, he'll find me there.

751
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,830
Did he follow you here?

752
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,410
No.

753
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,610
No, I ran.

754
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,130
God, he's gonna kill me.

755
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,130
I have nowhere else to go.

756
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,930
I, I asked that waitress.

757
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,510
She knew where you lived.

758
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,830
- Don't worry, I'll
take care of you, okay?

759
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,820
You're the only one who cares.

760
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,690
Here mom.

761
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,130
Thank you, honey.

762
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,860
Go play in your room, okay?

763
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Okay.

764
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,180
- [Clarisse] She'll
be fine, honey.

765
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,690
Oh god.

766
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,750
[Clarisse mumbles]

767
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,140
Ah.

768
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,960
[phone ringing]

769
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,790
- Jaden, honey, can
you get my phone?

770
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,170
[phone ringing]

771
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,370
Jaden?

772
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,200
[phone ringing]

773
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,140
Hello?

774
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,000
- [Allie] Hey,
mom, I'm in the ER.

775
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,860
- What?
- I fell at practice.

776
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,580
Oh my God, are you okay?

777
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,270
[Allie] No, I'm fine.

778
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,580
Can you come and get me?

779
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,780
Okay.

780
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,100
That, that was Allie.

781
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,830
She fell a gymnastics.

782
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,790
She's at the hospital.

783
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,620
I've gotta go.

784
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,240
Oh, okay.

785
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
Can, can I help?

786
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,930
Jaden, where are you?

787
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,200
Jaden, mommy's gotta go.

788
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,930
Jaden, mommy has to go.

789
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,070
Whoa, Clarisse, calm down.

790
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,030
What's going on?

791
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,000
Jaden's hiding.

792
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,930
He loves to hide.

793
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,720
Oh, okay, well, I'll stay.

794
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,106
I won't let nothing
happen to him.

795
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,130
I don't know.

796
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:53,930
Have little faith.

797
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,550
He's a big boy.

798
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,930
I got you.

799
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,240
Jaden, mommy's gonna go.

800
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,890
Cherry's gonna stay.

801
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:04,790
Jaden.

802
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:06,790
Hey Jaden.

803
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,060
[soft music]

804
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,720
Jaden, Cherry.

805
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,200
- [Cherry] We're
in Allie's room.

806
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,410
- You left Jaden here with
that homeless psycho?!

807
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,650
Uh uh.

808
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,930
Go fish.

809
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,130
[Clarisse] Jaden?

810
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,100
I'm teaching Cherry go fish.

811
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,140
And I am cheating
like hell, heck.

812
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,340
I'm cheating like heck.

813
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,470
Thank you.

814
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,130
Allie, come say a proper hello.

815
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,310
- Thanks for taking
care of my bro.

816
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,960
How's the eye, love?

817
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Sorer than hell.

818
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,270
I mean, heck.

819
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,170
- Well, you should really
put some ice on it.

820
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:14,760
It'll turn black and blue fast.

821
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,380
Trust me, I have a little
bit of experience with that,

822
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,370
but hey, we can heal together.

823
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,070
Sounds great.

824
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,270
Let's go.

825
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,000
You have such a
beautiful family.

826
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah.

827
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,070
So what's the deal with Allie?

828
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,030
Is she a stepdaughter?

829
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,230
She's adopted.

830
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,340
Walt had a short engagement
and she'd already had a baby.

831
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,760
Then she died in a car accident

832
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,860
and I've been Allie's
mother since she was two.

833
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,380
Wow.

834
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,930
Yep.

835
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,550
- She is so lucky
to have you guys.

836
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:04,930
Yeah, she is.

837
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,200
- But I'm sure that must be
tough on Allie too, though.

838
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:12,890
Yeah.

839
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,340
Yeah.

840
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,450
[phone ringing]

841
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,930
I'm gonna get my phone.

842
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,550
[phone ringing]

843
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

844
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,240
Is Allie all right?

845
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,380
- Yeah, bad landing
during a back flip,

846
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,270
cut under her eye.

847
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,470
- She's okay.
- All right.

848
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,626
I'm right around the corner.

849
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,240
I'll be there soon.

850
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,170
- [Clarisse] I'll see
you when you get here.

851
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,790
[upbeat music]

852
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,240
[upbeat music continues]

853
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,130
[upbeat music continues]

854
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,100
Hey.

855
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,480
Dad.

856
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,680
Hey, dad.

857
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,170
What's up, little man?

858
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,206
You know I was worried
about my princess, right?

859
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,580
Oh, yeah, I went to the ER.

860
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,520
This is Cherry.

861
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,000
She watched Jaden
while mom pick me up.

862
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,130
Thanks, Cherry.

863
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,900
Nice to meet you.

864
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,480
She beat me in go fish.

865
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,100
- Yeah, it's nice
to meet you too.

866
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,030
You must be the
king of the castle.

867
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,230
Yeah.

868
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,100
Cherry Redvine

869
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,580
at your service.

870
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,060
I'm Walt.

871
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,480
I've heard so many things.

872
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,480
Good things, I hope.

873
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,410
Where's your mother?

874
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,480
In the bedroom.

875
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,620
Excuse me.

876
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,680
[upbeat music continues]

877
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,030
Hey.

878
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,130
Hey.

879
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,380
You're early.

880
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,340
Great.

881
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,240
Yeah.

882
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,480
I was worried about Allie

883
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,310
and you too, of course.

884
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,410
See, you got some childcare
help out there, huh?

885
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,380
Yeah, that's Cherry.

886
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,520
She's great, isn't she?

887
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,520
Yeah, she's great.

888
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
She's beat the hell up.

889
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,416
Do you think that's
a good influence

890
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,240
for our kids to be around?

891
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,580
- I think she's
having a rough time.

892
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,380
I think my help
might be the bump

893
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,680
she needs to rise above it.

894
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,370
But who did that to her face?

895
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,900
Do you think he's gonna
come in looking for her?

896
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,310
No.

897
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,696
No, he didn't follow her here.

898
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,240
How would he know where we live?

899
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:07,960
She's in need.

900
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,160
So am I.

901
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,620
Walt,

902
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,960
I need to do this.

903
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,160
Yeah.

904
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,750
I know everybody's hungry.

905
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,100
[Walt] That's nice.

906
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,000
This is all so good.

907
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,210
- Wow, so cool that Walt helps
you with dinner, Clarisse.

908
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,580
You're lucky.

909
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,000
Huh?

910
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,800
Sounds like somebody
hit the mother load.

911
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,030
Let's say grace.

912
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,230
Uh, Can I?

913
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,410
Lord, above,

914
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:56,130
thank you for placing me
with this great family.

915
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,060
I have always wanted to
know what a home felt like.

916
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,510
And

917
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
now I know.

918
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,690
Amen.

919
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:08,890
[All] Amen.

920
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,380
- All right, I know
you want a biscuit.

921
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,170
- Give me the biscuits.
- Give them the biscuits.

922
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,620
- There you are.
- Thank you.

923
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,650
- [Clarisse] I'll
take one of these.

924
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:24,580
[distorted conversations]
[soft music]

925
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,270
Sorry to gush on grace.

926
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,030
Just look at me.

927
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:59,170
I have great food in front of me

928
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:00,680
and a great roof over my head,

929
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,310
and I get to share it
with such nice people.

930
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,170
- Yes, you have
to stay positive.

931
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,380
Always.

932
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,340
That's what I'm learning
from you, Clarisse.

933
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,550
Eat.

934
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,100
[soft music]

935
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,370
Okay, baby.

936
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:32,510
What's up?

937
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,240
I need you to tell
me what the plan is

938
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,550
with your little charity case.

939
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,170
Her sister's in Mississippi.

940
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,070
I offered to take her
to the bus station,

941
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,240
but she doesn't want her
sister seeing her beat up.

942
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,690
- Baby, that girl don't seem
much ashamed about anything.

943
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,170
- These women are good at
hiding how much it hurts.

944
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,650
It's not just the physical pain.

945
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,380
It's emotional.

946
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,580
Mental.

947
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,890
Okay, I understand.

948
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,720
But like I said, baby,

949
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
what is the plan?

950
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:12,370
- She asks if we could put her
in a hotel until she heals.

951
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,620
- Are you sure this girl
isn't manipulating you, baby?

952
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,760
- When I am scared and
afraid to leave the house,

953
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,100
you tell me to talk
to my therapist.

954
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,680
But when I step out on my
shell and I help somebody,

955
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,450
you imply I'm being manipulated.

956
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,720
Baby, come on.

957
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,200
You know that's
not what I meant.

958
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,580
Risse.

959
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:54,790
Where's Allie?

960
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,450
She's in the shower.

961
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,410
She said I could crash here.

962
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,170
- She's a great kid to
everybody who's not her mom.

963
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:09,310
You know, Walt, he
thinks I'm weak.

964
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,410
Pisses me off.

965
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,410
Listen,

966
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,930
I know you might
think I'm this wild,

967
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,820
uneducated woman, but I,

968
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,860
I know people.

969
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:28,790
And you,

970
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,860
you've got this
fire, this, this,

971
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,620
this fight inside
you and I, I see it.

972
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,310
You do?

973
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,860
Hey.

974
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,340
I just wanna say I'm
sorry for everything.

975
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,780
- Cherry's staying
with us for a week

976
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,270
until her eye clears up

977
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,370
and then I'm taking
her to the bus station.

978
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Okay.

979
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,340
[blender rumbling]

980
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:52,580
You're an early riser.

981
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,580
Guys, come on breakfast.

982
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,890
Good luck, they never listen.

983
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,000
You sure about that?

984
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,060
Come on, man.

985
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,930
Wow, this looks good, Cherry.

986
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,650
- And a healthy smoothie
for the man of the house.

987
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,620
Thank you.

988
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,890
Yeah, it looks great.

989
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,410
What?

990
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,960
Okay, I retire.

991
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,720
Jaden.

992
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,580
Jaden, stop that, please.

993
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,440
Jaden, stop.

994
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,520
Don't show your mom disrespect.

995
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,960
She asked you to stop.

996
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,720
You guys should really
appreciate your mom.

997
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:48,060
She is an amazing woman

998
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,060
and she loves you all so much.

999
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,480
Now, let's eat.

1000
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,000
I don't want anyone to be late.

1001
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,620
Yes.

1002
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:08,690
Okay.

1003
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,106
Hey, let me call you right back.

1004
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,130
Okay.

1005
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,130
Guess what?

1006
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,550
I found Cherry.

1007
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,750
Cherry?

1008
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,920
Really?

1009
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,510
Where?

1010
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,860
Billy beat her up again

1011
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,930
and she's staying with
us until she heals.

1012
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,440
- He beat her up again?
- Yeah.

1013
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,000
- Wait, she's staying
with you at your house?

1014
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,200
Yeah.

1015
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:35,450
- Mm, I don't know how I
feel about that, Clarisse.

1016
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,060
You're dealing with a very
violent, dangerous man.

1017
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,860
You're putting yourself
and your family in danger.

1018
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,090
Are you saying I'm not capable

1019
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,000
of taking care of my own family?

1020
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,070
I'm not saying all of that.

1021
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,720
What I'm saying is we all
know what Billy is capable of.

1022
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,000
He choked Lauren.

1023
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,860
Cherry is afraid and in need.

1024
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,650
And I stepped up.

1025
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,060
And I applaud that.

1026
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,490
Okay, but that
still does not mean

1027
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,650
that you opened up
your home to the girls.

1028
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,760
I'm not you, Doris.

1029
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,030
No, you're not, Clarisse.

1030
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,070
And all the women here love you.

1031
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,140
But that still does not mean

1032
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:21,580
that you invite them
into your safe place.

1033
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,780
What were you thinking?

1034
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,760
You know what?

1035
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,960
I quit.

1036
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,100
Clarisse.

1037
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,620
Clarisse.

1038
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,030
I care about you.

1039
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,580
Oh god, really.

1040

Sheriff Clay.

1044
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,100
Hi, Sheriff.

1045
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,550
This is Doris,

1046
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,350
the director of the
Willing Hill Shelter.

1047
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,480
You actually came
by the other day

1048
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,140
about the guy who choked
one of my residents.

1049
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,030
Yes, of course.

1050
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,860
How can I help you, Doris?

1051
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,060
One of my employees,

1052
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,030
her name is Clarisse Spencer.

1053
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,000
She took in one of
our battered women.

1054
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,860
The young lady's name
is Cherry Redvine.

1055
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,070
Okay, and you think this,

1056
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:23,860
her batterer might find this
Cherry in Mrs. Spencer's home?

1057
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,936
- He was the one that was
violent with my girls,

1058
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,510
and he threatened
to kill Cherry.

1059
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,510
I'm very concerned.

1060
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,650
All right.

1061
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,170
Putting her home
on my route now.

1062
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,830
Thank you, Doris.

1063
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,130
[soft music]

1064
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,680
Hello.

1065
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,580
Oh, hi.

1066
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,780
You're home early.

1067
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:13,130
Yeah.

1068
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,270
I just quit.

1069
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,720
Good.

1070
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,620
It's about time you
stood up for yourself.

1071
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,820
Oh, it feels weird.

1072
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,030
I shouldn't have done that.

1073
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,230
It's irresponsible.

1074
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,820
- Once a good girl,
always a good girl.

1075
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,680
That's who I am.

1076
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,790
- Yeah, but I mean
when is the last time

1077
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,210
that you fuck the system?

1078
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,410
Feels good, right?

1079
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,580
A little.

1080
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,780
Yeah.

1081
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,200
- Do people take advantage
of you, Clarisse?

1082
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,340
Yeah.

1083
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:03,030
- Even though you always
do the right thing.

1084
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,060
Then screw them.

1085
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,550
Right.

1086
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,750
Right.

1087
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,170
Screw 'em.

1088
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,580
Screw 'em.

1089
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,240
Oh, yeah.

1090
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,930
Well, you know, I
was just out here

1091
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,720
trying to seduce all
these neighbors of yours.

1092
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,000
What neighbors?

1093
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,340
You are fearless.

1094
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:38,270
I admire that.

1095
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,240
You should try it,

1096
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,440
with me.

1097
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,070
You and I being
fearless together,

1098
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:48,580
giving zero fucks.

1099
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,340
Must be very liberating.

1100
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,030
What,

1101
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,580
what are you most afraid of?

1102
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:03,650
Losing my family.

1103
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:12,100
- You are not gonna
lose your family.

1104
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,820
Say it.

1105
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,410
- I'm not going
to lose my family.

1106
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,750
- The day that you
actually believe that,

1107
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,370
you'll be free of that fear.

1108
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:27,930
Thank you.

1109
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,030
I'll work on that.

1110
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,030
- Well, the working
starts today.

1111
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,650
Go get a bikini and take
off your fucking top

1112
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:36,850
and get in here.

1113
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,860
Mm.

1114
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,310
I'll go get a bikini,

1115
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,650
but I'm leaving my top on.

1116
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:46,270
Woo.

1117
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,470
Baby steps.

1118
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,550
- Baby steps.
- Baby steps.

1119
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,860
I'll move this little
jet right here.

1120
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,410
It feels so good.

1121
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:10,760
How you doing Mrs. Spencer?

1122
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,960
Ma'am?

1123
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,100
Sheriff Clay.

1124
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,030
What brings you around here?

1125
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,070
Doing my day's rounds.

1126
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,480
Hope all is well around here.

1127
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,000
- Well everything is
peaceful, as you can see.

1128
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Indeed it is.

1129
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,100
Ma'am.

1130
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Have a good day.

1131
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,270
- No, but I mean
it, I mean, no one

1132
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,380
has ever shown me
love like you before.

1133
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,030
I, I, I really appreciate it.

1134
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,650
- You've had an
effect on me too.

1135
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,030
- You know, just a
little bit more wine,

1136
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:55,790
and I think you and I should

1137
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:58,720
just go Thelma and Louise
on the whole fucking world.

1138
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,140
- Oh.
- Fly over the edge.

1139
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,270
What about my kids?

1140
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:04,480
They can come.

1141
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,930
Just nod it over the edge.

1142
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,510
[Clarisse laughs]

1143
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:13,930
Woo.

1144
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:16,240
[soft music]

1145
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:44,510
Babe.

1146
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,240
What are you doing?

1147
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,550
[soft music]

1148
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,960
[soft music continues]

1149
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:12,440
[soft music continues]

1150
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,346
[Clarisse] I had some wine.

1151
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,140
I went to the bedroom.

1152
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,930
It was incredible.

1153
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:19,620
That's great.

1154
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,000
It's been a long time.

1155
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,270
It's terrific.

1156
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,900
This Cherry seems to be
a positive influence.

1157
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,170
She's helping you
get past your fears.

1158
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,370
Yeah.

1159
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:32,030
Yeah, I got some
of my mojo back.

1160
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:34,170
Not so many nightmares.

1161
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,170
I don't feel so helpless.

1162
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,000
Good.

1163
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,930
Just be weary, all right.

1164
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:44,000
When we base our happiness on
an emotion or another person,

1165
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,130
we sometimes leave
ourself open to let down.

1166
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,140
I know she'll be leaving.

1167
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,930
- I do.
- Yeah.

1168
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,860
Well, she may have
kickstarted the new you,

1169
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,100
but this is you Clarisse.

1170
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,170
Yeah.

1171
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,620
I, I feel like I used to feel

1172
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,100
back before Jaden
was taken from me.

1173
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,340
Good.

1174
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,930
This is you.

1175
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,240
You did the work.

1176
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,240
You made the progress.

1177
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,240
Not her.

1178
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,620
You.

1179
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,450
Remember that.

1180
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:16,650
Yeah.

1181
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,480
- Me.
- Yeah.

1182
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,276
- I'm reminding you
of the merger meeting

1183
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,000
in Phoenix tomorrow.

1184
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,550
You're on a plane tonight and
I booked you into a hotel.

1185
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,750
Yeah.

1186
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,680
- I could meet you
there if you want.

1187
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,410
Separate planes, of course.

1188
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,000
[soft music]

1189
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,270
Cancel my flight.

1190
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,100
I'm going home to my wife.

1191
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,000
[phone trilling]

1192
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:24,030
[uneasy music] [water flowing]

1193
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:33,750
[uneasy music]

1194
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,310
[screaming]

1195
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,240
Shit, Cherry.

1196
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,440
What?

1197
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:49,656
I thought you were Clarisse.

1198
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,270
I, I was just trying to.

1199
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,310
- She said that I could shower
while she went shopping.

1200
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,440
Can I have a little
privacy, please?

1201
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:01,170
- So now I'm getting kicked
outta my own damn shower!

1202
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,220
- [Clarisse] Put
'em on the counter.

1203
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:15,410
Okay, mom.

1204
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:30,620
What are you doing home?

1205
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,720
- Do you know, I just
walked in on that woman

1206
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:33,920
in my shower.

1207
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,410
- What?
- Yeah.

1208
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,610
I thought she was you.

1209
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:41,820
I think he was disappointed.

1210
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:44,790
He was hoping to see you.

1211
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,650
Yeah,

1212
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:50,410
I was.

1213
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:55,340
- Well, I guess
everybody makes mistakes.

1214
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,450
Cherry, can you take
the kids out for a sec

1215
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:02,310
so that Walt and I can talk?

1216
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:03,760
Yeah, sure.

1217
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,936
Let me just throw on some
clothes and we'll take 'em out.

1218
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,170
Hey guys, you wanna go play?

1219
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:08,830
Yeah.

1220
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,030
Come on, Jaden.

1221
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,450
I know.

1222
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:23,410
Can we just talk?

1223
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,720
Yeah.

1224
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:28,890
Okay.

1225
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,450
Baby, I'm serious.

1226
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:37,140
I'm so embarrassed.

1227
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,620
I really thought
she was you, okay?

1228
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,580
- I know, don't
worry about that.

1229
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:47,410
I actually need to talk to you
about something I did wrong.

1230
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,650
Okay.

1231
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:52,580
I lied to you.

1232
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,140
Well, I didn't lie.

1233
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:59,580
I just didn't tell you
everything about Cherry.

1234
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,170
Oh, okay.

1235
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,960
- She left the shelter
because of her boyfriend.

1236
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,820
He choked another woman
there named Lauren, and

1237
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,170
he threatened to
kill Cherry too.

1238
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,270
What?

1239
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:20,960
Shit baby.

1240
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,380
Why you didn't tell me
that in the first place.

1241
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,650
- I was making
real strides there.

1242
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,036
I thought if you knew how
dangerous the men were,

1243
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,240
you wouldn't want me
working there anymore.

1244
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,550
Wait, well, oh, hold on.

1245
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,960
So you telling me

1246
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,480
it's a crazy psychopath
killer after this woman

1247
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,036
and she's been
staying in our house?

1248
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,550
I'm sorry.

1249
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,930
I apologize.

1250
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,340
We've been doing better and
I don't want any secrets.

1251
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,890
- Well, I got something
I need to tell you too.

1252
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:06,480
I was seeing somebody else,

1253
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,790
but it's already over.

1254
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:10,860
I broke it off, okay.

1255
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,690
I swear to God.

1256
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:13,890
I'm sorry baby.

1257
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:17,340
And it means nothing.

1258
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,170
I'm sorry.

1259
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:19,370
You are sorry?

1260
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,650
Yeah.

1261
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,450
You're sorry.

1262
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,340
Walt, what the fuck?!

1263
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,900
Baby, it didn't mean anything.

1264
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,140
It didn't mean anything?

1265
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,550
No.

1266
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:31,900
Oh, it means something.

1267
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,210
It means everything.

1268
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,480
[sad music]

1269
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,650
Goddammit.

1270
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:45,960
No, don't.

1271
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:49,890
No,

1272
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:52,930
no, don't you touch me.

1273
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,380
Don't you say anything to me.

1274
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,310
I don't wanna see you.

1275
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:57,580
You just go.

1276
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:59,790
Leave?

1277
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,930
Walt, when I met you,

1278
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:08,760
you were a grieving man
with an orphan baby.

1279
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,930
I put this entire
family on my back.

1280
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,650
How could you?

1281
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,620
Go.

1282
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,450
Go!

1283
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,720
[sad music]

1284
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:42,890
Oh my God.

1285
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:50,580
- [Cherry] Oh, you
definitely won that one.

1286
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:56,650
Where are you going?

1287
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,620
I got a business thing.

1288
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:59,820
See you.

1289
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,760
- We are gonna make
tater tots and hotdogs.

1290
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:06,960
Yes.

1291
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,480
- [Cherry] All
right, come on Jaden.

1292
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:11,550
Let's go, Allie.

1293
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,310
[emotional music]

1294
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,960
[Clarisse sobbing]

1295
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,750
[knocking on door]

1296
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:03,130
Walt, he's cheating on me.

1297
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,960
What?

1298
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,130
I'm sorry.

1299
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:16,690
- He said it's over,
but I can't trust him.

1300
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,480
I mean, what the fuck?!

1301
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,930
I chased him away.

1302
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:29,790
But all my fears, all
my, I did, I did this.

1303
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1304
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,170
Okay.

1305
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,030
Look, no marriage is perfect.

1306
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:43,960
And he messed up.

1307
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,930
I mean, he, he made a mistake,

1308
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,450
a huge fucking mistake.

1309
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:49,100
But, Clarisse,

1310
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,030
that man he

1311
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,230
loves you.

1312
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,680
I can see it in his eyes.

1313
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,620
I'm so,

1314
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:02,580
I'm so mad right now.

1315
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,580
But I don't want
the kids to know.

1316
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,240
Not yet.

1317
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:13,890
Please.

1318
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,720
[emotional music]

1319
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,830
Oh God.

1320
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:33,620
[emotional music continues]

1321
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:48,890
It's like my heart has been
ripped out of my chest,

1322
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,930
my perfect life.

1323
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:59,440
- Look, I have been
hurt so many times,

1324
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,960
but the pain is temporary.

1325
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,000
I promise.

1326
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,580
It makes you stronger.

1327
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:09,650
You realize that
there is no one else.

1328
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:12,870
But you know what, Clarisse,

1329
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:16,760
you can be a beautiful
badass butterfly.

1330
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,240
We just got a bust out of the...

1331
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,030
Blossom,

1332
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:20,000
you've been a bad girl.

1333
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,860
You coming with me.

1334
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:22,690
Ah.

1335
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,650
[dramatic music]

1336
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:36,130
[dramatic music continues]

1337
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:46,130
[dramatic music continues]

1338
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:49,860
- Ah.
- Come on.

1339
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,720
Come on, let's go.

1340
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,240
[dramatic music continues]

1341
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,240
Okay, okay.

1342
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,890
Is he out there?

1343
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,680
No.

1344
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:08,240
- Oh God.
- Are you okay?

1345
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,070
Uh huh.

1346
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,270
Yeah.

1347
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:15,900
[phone trilling]

1348
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,270
[Operator] 911.

1349
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:18,210
- [Clarisse] This
is Clarisse Spencer.

1350
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,930
There's an armed man
outside my house.

1351
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:23,340
[tense music]

1352
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:30,580
I'm gonna kill him.

1353
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:32,620
Oh my God.

1354
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,140
Cherry, the gun
isn't even loaded.

1355
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,930
[tense music]

1356
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,580
Oh no, he's going to the back.

1357
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,780
Okay.

1358
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:42,310
[tense music]

1359
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,130
The sheriff will be here soon.

1360
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,200
Not soon enough.

1361
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,750
Blossom, gimme that knife.

1362
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,140
No, no.

1363
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,270
Why you up in my business?

1364
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:11,470
I called the police.

1365
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,100
Blossom, you coming with me.

1366
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,860
- Unless you plan on
killing both of us,

1367
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,860
you get the fuck
out of my house.

1368
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,100
[Billy chuckling]

1369
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,760
- I'm coming back
for you, bitch.

1370
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,310
And you,

1371
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,720
next time you try to stop me,

1372
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,000
I will kill you.

1373
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,130
I am so sorry.

1374
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:44,000
- No one should be that
afraid of another person.

1375
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,960
[sirens wailing]

1376
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,070
Mrs. Spencer.

1377
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,170
Someone broke into my house.

1378
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:10,936
- [Sheriff Clay] Are
they still inside?

1379
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,030
No, he left.

1380
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,230
Very good, good.

1381
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:15,270
Okay, do me a favor,
go back inside.

1382
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:16,866
I'm gonna clear area, be
in and talk to you, okay.

1383
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:17,890
Okay.

1384
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,210
Two alpha five to dispatch.

1385
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:21,890
Show me out on scene
with the subject.

1386
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:22,960
I advise on further.

1387
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,480
- It took him 15
minutes to get here.

1388
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,140
Better late than never.

1389
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,340
Was that your old boyfriend?

1390
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:34,540
Yeah.

1391
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,310
Learn from my
mistakes, become a nun.

1392
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:37,510
Men are not worth it.

1393
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:39,960
He's gone.

1394
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,930
Gone for good?

1395
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:44,000
Yes, I promise.

1396
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,210
Good 'cause

1397
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:49,860
I thought my heart
was gonna explode.

1398
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,720
Mine too, baby, mine too.

1399
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,860
[Sheriff Clay knocking]

1400
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:58,860
All clear.

1401
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,450
Everybody okay?

1402
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:03,170
Yeah.

1403
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:04,410
Did you know this person?

1404
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,140
No, never saw him before.

1405
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,550
He looked like a transient.

1406
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,240
You seen him before?

1407
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,410
I, I'm new here.

1408
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,380
And you are ma'am?

1409
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,210
She's my cousin,

1410
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:22,410
Sam from Miami.

1411
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,890
This number is my direct line.

1412
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,550
You got a problem, you call.

1413
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:34,930
Thanks.

1414
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,440
Evening ladies, kids.

1415
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:53,450
Look, he won't be back.

1416
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:56,140
Billy is scared
shitless of cops.

1417
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,790
He didn't seem scared.

1418
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,410
[soft music]

1419
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,310
I'm giving you
some of my clothes

1420
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:19,060
so you look presentable when
you get to your sisters.

1421
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,310
I cannot thank you enough

1422
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:24,626
for everything
you've done for me.

1423
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:26,960
Why does Cherry have to leave?

1424
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:35,410
- Cherry usually doesn't
stay places too long.

1425
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,930
A change will do her good.

1426
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:43,030
It, it did you good, right?

1427
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,310
Yeah.

1428
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:47,510
Yeah it did.

1429
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:50,130
I am so sorry, Clarisse.

1430
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,790
Don't, don't

1431
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:54,930
apologize for him.

1432
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:56,550
No, I'm apologizing for me.

1433
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,310
I'm so sorry for bringing you
into all this, all this shit.

1434
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:03,960
All,

1435
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,160
all this.

1436
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,140
And I was being sincere

1437
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,180
when I said I appreciated
you giving me a home.

1438
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,060
Because honest to God,

1439
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,060
I have never had one before.

1440
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,410
It was nice.

1441
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,100
It was really nice.

1442
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,960
Thank you.

1443
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,130
I will wait for you in the car.

1444
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,130
Excuse me, sir.

1445
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,960
[emotional music]

1446
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:45,860
[phone trilling]

1447
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:47,060
- Hey.
- Hey.

1448
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:48,130
What's up?

1449
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,210
- I'm taking Cherry
to the bus station.

1450
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:55,900
Maybe you can come by for
lunch and we can talk then.

1451
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,270
- [Walt] Okay, yeah,
that sounds great.

1452
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:59,470
Okay.

1453
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,310
[emotional music]

1454
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:17,070
- Dad.
- Dad!

1455
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,270
Hey.

1456
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,310
I missed you too.

1457
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,510
[Jaden] The sheriff came.

1458
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,210
What?

1459
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:27,240
- Yeah, Cherry's gangster
boyfriend just showed up.

1460
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,450
Whatever, it's over.

1461
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,050
We just took her
to the bus station.

1462
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:30,580
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1463
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,780
Hold on, what?

1464
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:34,000
Are you okay?

1465
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,620
I am fine.

1466
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,030
I will tell you later.

1467
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:41,210
So you're fine?

1468
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:42,960
It's a long story.

1469
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,450
Let's eat.

1470
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:48,100
- Then mom was like Gandalf and
said, "You shall not enter".

1471
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,140
You're stupid.

1472
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,100
We got mom, with hos gangsta.

1473
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,240
I'm so proud of her.

1474
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,960
I just feel awful for Cherry.

1475
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,380
She must be devastated.

1476
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,930
Yeah?

1477
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:00,130
Yeah.

1478
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,620
It might be good for you.

1479
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:06,370
[soft music]

1480
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:15,270
Billy?

1481
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:16,470
What the fuck?

1482
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:18,410
You scream,

1483
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:19,140
I'll kill you.

1484
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:21,410
Please, please don't hurt me.

1485
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,000
I'll do anything.

1486
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,960
You forget I was even here.

1487
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,440
This wasn't me, this
was your boyfriend Walt.

1488
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,480
He angry when you ended this.

1489
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,620
You bring up my
name, you're dead.

1490
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,750
Babe.

1491
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,100
I,

1492
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,310
Just listen to me, please.

1493
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:48,510
I am,

1494
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:53,000
I'm 100% committed to us,

1495
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,580
to you.

1496
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,410
And if I gotta get counseling

1497
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,100
or therapy or whatever it takes,

1498
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,410
I'm willing to do that baby.

1499
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:04,030
I'm willing to do
whatever you need.

1500
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,820
I am exhausted, Walt.

1501
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,410
First the thing with
Cherry and Billy,

1502
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:12,610
then you,

1503
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,210
I don't know what I need.

1504
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,410
Okay, okay.

1505
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,750
It doesn't matter

1506
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,440
'cause we're gonna
figure it out together.

1507
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,170
All right. [doorbell ringing]

1508
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,410
Who the hell is that?

[ominous music]

1510
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:38,030
- [Clarisse] Walt,
don't answer it.

1511
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:39,310
Hey.

1512
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:40,510
It's Cherry.

1513
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,130
Cherry?

1514
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,210
[tense music]

1515
01:24:55,410 --> 01:24:56,650
Knock, knock motherfuckers.

1516
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:02,140
I'm sorry, Clarisse.

1517
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,760
It's nothing personal.

1518
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,270
[tense music]

1519
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,140
Now move it.

1520
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,340
Now.

1521
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:12,410
- Hey.
- Move!

1522
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,240
We going to your vault, Walt.

1523
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:27,100
It's Saturday.

1524
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,100
The vault is
closed, you asshole.

1525
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:29,900
No shit.

1526
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,480
That's why we going today.

1527
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,246
- [Walt] All right, just
leave my family out of this.

1528
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,790
Dad!

1529
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:35,270
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1530
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,830
You kids stay the fuck calm.

1531
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:39,070
I put a bullet in your mama.

1532
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:41,110
Don't want y'all growing
up like Auntie Blossom

1533
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,410
without no mama now.

1534
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,750
You kids sit by your mama.

1535
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,170
Come here, baby.

1536
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:52,760
Your kids can handle this.

1537
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,310
You need to let them go.

1538
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:55,510
Okay.

1539
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,450
Calm your fucking family, man.

1540
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:00,620
- If you hurt my
family, I will kill you.

1541
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,760
If you want everyone to live,

1542
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,720
you will calm everyone
the fuck down.

1543
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,930
- All right, all
right, all right.

1544
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,690
Everybody relax, okay.

1545
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:11,170
I'll do whatever you want.

1546
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:12,690
Yeah, you is.

1547
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:14,480
Or you going be sorry.

1548

[Walt groaning]

1549
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,270
What's the matter, football
stud ain't gonna fight back?

1550
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:28,240
Stop.

1551
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,440
Stop.

[kids sobbing]

1553
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,170
You shut the fuck up,

1554
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:40,550
or uncle Billy's got
cut out your tongues.

1555
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,380
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

1556
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:43,580
Trust me.

1557
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,310
You have to trust me.

1558
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:47,480
- Hey, just get the
money and fucking go.

1559
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,720
Enough of these games.

1560
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,820
- You don't fucking tell
me what to do, bitch.

1561
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,210
Everyone stay quiet, okay.

1562
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:55,720
You're gonna take this tape

1563
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,210
and you're gonna tie your
kids' hands behind their back.

1564
01:26:58,410 --> 01:26:59,140
Got it?

1565
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,340
Come on.

1566
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:01,310
Come on.

1567
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:02,690
We on a schedule.

1568
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:04,240
Tell your family goodbye.

1569
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:06,650
I love you.

1570
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,860
I'm sorry.

1571
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,550
- I'm so sorry.
- Shut up!

1572
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:11,860
Let's move.

1573
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,960
Move, up!

1574
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:16,580
Come on man.

1575
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,000
Don't get any ideas.

1576
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,550
In the car!

1577
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,270

01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:25,720
[tense music]

1579
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:38,890
Amy's a fighter.

1580
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:41,510
You lucky dog.

1581
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:44,720
What the fuck, man?

1582
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,900
What you bring her into
this shit for, huh?

1583
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,900
- Unhappy husband
has a girlfriend.

1584
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,520
Unhappy at work robs
his own business.

1585
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,960
Wants to skip town.

1586
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,586
- Man, ain't nobody gonna
believe that shit, man.

1587
01:27:58,610 --> 01:27:59,820
It's a diversion, Walt.

1588
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:02,690
They don't have to.

1589
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:05,650
By the time they figure
out it wasn't you,

1590
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:07,060
we halfway out the country.

1591
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,550
- All right, all,
all right, all right.

1592
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:13,270
I'll do whatever you say.

1593
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:14,480
Good.

1594
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,860
Or else your wife,

1595
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,520
your kids and your
girlfriend gonna be dead.

1596
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,720
All right, man.

1597
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:21,340
Just get the gun outta my face.

1598
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:22,580
All right, look,

1599
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:23,860
in and out.

1600
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:25,060
No problems.

1601
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,960
[soft music]

1602
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:38,890
- I taught you how
to play go fish.

1603
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,790
- Everyone keep
their mouths shut.

1604
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,480
Why?

1605
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,580
To get paid.

1606
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,440
Why us?

1607
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:56,960
Oh yeah.

1608
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,130
We got to you through Walt.

1609
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:05,960
Yeah, because we knew
how vulnerable you are.

1610
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,310
I was.

1611
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,550
Yeah.

1612
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,930
You know what,

1613
01:29:10,130 --> 01:29:11,650
I actually kind of
liked you, Clarisse.

1614
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15,550
I mean, no one had ever
cared for me before

1615
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,750
quite like you,

1616
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,720
so, you know, it almost
made me think twice

1617
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,720
about doing all of this.

1618
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,130

You can have the money.

1622
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,380
All of it.

1623
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:11,310
Just let us go, please.

1624
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:15,410
- We are getting the
money, with or without you.

1625
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:16,610
You're an asshole.

1626
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,480
[Clarisse] Hey.

1627
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,410
That's right.

1628
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:26,650
Give me attitude, give me
lip and I will cut you up.

1629
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:28,690
Do you understand?

1630
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:29,900
You leave them alone.

1631
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,370
You are not in charge anymore.

I will make you bleed.

1638
