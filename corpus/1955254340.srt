00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,519
Although the brain is clinically dead,
charging active neurons one last time

174
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:20,316
and allows us to see
a map of your neural pattern.

175
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:22,723
What then transferred
to the other's head?

176
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:26,072
No... its not... not a transfer.
Jericho was chosen

177
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,260
because Stuart has syndrome frontal lobe.

178
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,700
A trauma to his brains as a child,
is incredibly rare. One in 10 millions.

179
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:37,075
His frontal lobe remains in an undeveloped
state. A hotbed of neural stem cells.

180
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:40,608
We stimulatee them with theta
waves duplicating the pattern.

181
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,972
You might have done this work?

182
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:47,506
The subjects rats walked staight through
mazes. Thats what they had never seen before.

183
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,496
Rats?

184
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:51,395
What about human trials?

185
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,155
You are looking at it.

186
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,079
What happened to that other guy?

187
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:36,955
<i>Drilling begins.</i>

188
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:55,929
<i>Receiver Port ready for insertion.</i>

189
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,794
<i>Fiber optic wand is ready for insertion.</i>

190
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:19,530
<i>Theta Waves are activated.</i>

191
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:27,056
<i>Neural cell stimulation commenced.</i>

192
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,211
Test Theta.

193
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,422
Oh! The temperature is hiking.

194
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:52,571
Before bleeding, it's in 102. 104.

195
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,534
Calls back... stroke 104 sir.

196
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:57,242
What is going on?
We're losing him.

197
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,325
We have to stop bleeding or he will die.

198
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,914
Alright, we remove the robotic injector...

199
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,925
Hey! You pull that thing.

200
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,181
You, carry on.

201
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,610
You think... still we can't.

202
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:16,478
Carry on.

203
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:26,622
It is stabilizing.

204
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,640
What we tell his wife?

205
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:00,532
Nothing.

206
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:05,511
As far as she knows,
Billy died ten days ago.

207
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,875
That is not right.

208
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:13,005
Now if he comes from nothing like Billy.

209
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:14,973
Like Billy.

210
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:50,560
Jericho?

211
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:52,692
Jericho?

212
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,584
Jericho.

213
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:04,984
Jericho.

214
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:10,500
Jericho take it easy.
Everything is fine.

215
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:13,074
My head...
I've just gave you an injection.

216
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:15,764
It will take effect in a minute.
You will feel better.

217
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,981
You swear God?
I swear. You trust me.

218
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:22,304
Ok. Everybody out.
No no no .. there is a protocol ..

219
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:25,177
No, No, you stay.
Everybody else, come on!

220
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:36,128
Hey, Hey, Look at me, Look at me.
Do you know who I am?

221
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,924
My .. My head is bad,
I need some kind of pill.

222
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,310
Yes, no, I love in getting thing.

223
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,660
But first I need you to remember.

224
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:48,498
Remember what? What's your name?

225
00:24:50,877 --> 00:24:52,113
- My name?
- Your name.

226
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,129
Your name is Bill Pope.

227
00:24:57,702 --> 00:24:59,469
Why, you messing with me boss?

228
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,710
I'm sick, doc.
I need some kind of shock..

229
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:05,366
I need something.
Its okay. Nobody...

230
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,107
Only you can help.

231
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:13,868
Your name is Bill Pope.
Even you may tell your office is in CIA.

232
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,257
Intelligence?

233
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:18,707
Hum.. Fuck ...What the fuck?

234
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,787
- Pay attention.
- What did you do to me?

235
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,801
- Pay... What did you do to me?
- Pay attention!

236
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:27,175
Right, Jan Strook
Dutch programmer, a genius.

237
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,940
He sold trapdoors to Heimdahl.
I need water.

238
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,407
That's better.

239
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,563
Now, a few days ago...

240
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:42,801
The Dutchman dug a
wormhole in the deep web.

241
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:45,492
You can stop there and give me
a moment with him to hear me.

242
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:47,482
For me this is the theta major
brain surgery...

243
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:50,072
he is not able to tell you anything...
Oh!

244
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:53,732
Suddenly the Dutchman
has got command under his control.

245
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,453
He can fire missiles at anytime, anywhere.

246
00:25:56,591 --> 00:26:02,169
If... over his head,
So the Dutchman calls you, Bill Pope.

247
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,095
He needed protection
Offered to make a deal...

248
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:08,805
With you, Bill Pope.
I need something, please.

249
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,419
An aspirin. I beg...
Give him an aspirin.

250
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,925
Aspirin is not good for you.
But this will help.

251
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:22,971
Billy, we had orders to put it
in the Dutchman's head.

252
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:25,426
But you forced the game off,
because you thought

253
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:28,455
you could trust him by paying him on.
Remember?

254
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:33,261
Billy!... With, we did it your way.
You brought him to such a safe house.

255
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:36,341
Remember? Anything? Billy!

256
00:26:39,872 --> 00:26:44,136
Where is he? Where the Dutchman right now?
That's all we need to know.

257
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,838
You went back to him.
You had picked up the money.

258
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:49,203
You without action went
back to close the deal.

259
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,375
Remember? Remember?

260
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,206
I remember nothing, Fucker.

261
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,208
Me confused with somebody else.

262
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:11,878
Try family.

263
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,169
Your daughter's name? Come on.
Remembers it. What is her name?

264
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:22,025
Emma. Your wife Jilly? Jill?

265
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,108
Come on. Shit. You remember.
Something. Anything.

266
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:32,591
We have nothing.
The science behind it is good.

267
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:35,495
Shit, Fuck it Science.

268
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:39,676
How long have you worked on this?
18 years.

269
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:43,218
We want a refund.

270
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:47,124
Pack up these trials. Yes, sir.

271
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:53,181
<b>Jan Stroop ALIAS The Dutchman.</b>

272
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,548
Guys, we're back to square one.
We start from the beginning.

273
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:16,313
Charlie, put the Dutchman's video.
Yes, sir.

274
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,170
What a fucking mess.
My name is Jan Strook.

275
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:23,097
My Cyber name is Dutchman.

276
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:26,803
I am now the Sole administrator
of Vigilant Shield..

277
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:31,331
The emergency command and control
systems of the United States...

278
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:35,847
I can authorize and
activate any weapons system in its arsenal.

279
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,731
And I can overwrite any standing order.

280
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:42,829
I will sell wormhole back to you.

281
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:48,286
For asylum, a permanent passport, guaranteed
protection and ten million dollars.

282
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:54,748
Turn it off. Let us think about this...
Heimdahl have safe house here.

283
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:59,476
The luggage stores is here. So somewhere
between those two points, the Dutchman is.

284
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:01,596
But where?

285
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:08,387
Hotel, hostel? The homeless shelters
already checked. So what the hell is?

286
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,148
You're not listening to me.

287
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,558
- Hello.
- Bill Pope, please.

288
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,540
Who is this?
An old friend, Jan Strook.

289
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,228
- Is he there?
- Billy...

290
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:22,808
My husband is dead.

291
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:29,863
Hello?

292
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,662
Can I have a minute, guys?

293
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,163
Open your mouth.

294
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:08,878
Its a vasodilator to increase
the blood circulation...

295
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:10,882
and reduce the pressure
inside your head.

296
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:17,590
Thanks Doc. You release me now?

297
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,944
You take care yourself.

298
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:24,857
Okay!

299
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:30,978
Who loves?
$ 4.20. Number eleven, order ready.

300
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,880
Hey! Hey! Hey!... Hey!

301
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:46,488
Gun? You are funny.

302
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:48,958
It's not worth it.

303
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:52,585
Who is that guy?

304
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,107
What's wrong with your face?

305
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,884
- I'll take your van.
- What?

306
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:11,845
What did you say?
I said I take you Van.

307
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:14,647
Ht is saying that he
will take our van.

308
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,739
What? He can get the hiccups.

309
00:37:16,883 --> 00:37:19,553
You heard him, and now get out.

310
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,363
Come on, get out.

311
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:27,772
What happens?

312
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:30,770
What is happening here?

313
00:37:32,408 --> 00:37:34,818
My leg, dirty bastard.

314
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:35,859
Martin.

315
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:51,955
You fucking...

316
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:09,567
- Who is this guy?
- I'm cold.

317
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:10,054
Where is the money, Jill?

318
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,029
No, the big bag of money.

319
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:19,141
- Billy's bag.
- I do not know.

320
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:21,890
Please.

321
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:29,403
Do not make me hurt you.

322
00:44:31,283 --> 00:44:34,553
Please you can take whatever you want.
Yah! No wish I have...

323
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:45,879
You have changed the PIN.
The PIN code 6969.

324
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,150
Yah! I know stuff.

325
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:14,121
SILENT ALARM

326
00:45:16,195 --> 00:45:18,168
A silent alarm from the Pope's house.

327
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:47,196
Security code, please.
Alpha, 2365.

328
00:45:47,793 --> 00:45:51,349
Emma must have pressed the button
by mistake, guys. Sorry, I will restart.

329
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:19,394
It's okay. Where you are going?
Is it okay? It's okay!

330
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,902
Mama is with you.
There's someone in the house.

331
00:47:01,376 --> 00:47:06,895
My name is Jan, Jan Strook.
My cyber name is Dutchman.

332
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:10,725
I am now the sole administrator

333
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:14,251
The emergency command and control
systems of the United States.

334
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:20,953
I brought you in. I made my partner.
I treated you like my son...

335
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:23,319
And you betrayed me.

336
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:28,621
I am seeking cede control
to an irresponsible authority.

337
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:32,884
The Americans have fucked me and
now they want to kill me.

338
00:47:32,908 --> 00:47:36,477
<i>I will find and rip it to get
your heart out, you understand?</i>

339
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:40,504
The anarchist Heimdhal is chasing me and...
I can not let...

340
00:47:40,604 --> 00:47:44,144
tracing.. fuck and getting..
Because I'm not crazy.

341
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:51,625
Jan. Please come back.
Come back home. To the cause.

342
00:47:57,707 --> 00:48:02,988
I asked for asylum in Russian Federation.
And a permanent passport.

343
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:08,302
I want a better deal and a bodyguard.
Guaranteed protection and ten million $.

344
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:11,511
It's not about the money,
but my freedom.

345
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:15,701
I will demonstrate my control over
Vigilant Shield today at 6 PM.

346
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:21,174
<b>Nine hours to deadline.</b>

347
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:23,125
Understood.

348
00:48:26,663 --> 00:48:30,430
We'll wait for deadline.
Let's see what the Dutch can do.

349
00:48:32,057 --> 00:48:33,262
Jilian called the police.

350
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:36,397
They have a description
of the intruder.

351
00:48:37,095 --> 00:48:40,304
It looks like Jericho, she
told he knew personal details.

352
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,672
PIN number, security code.
You're kidding me.

353
00:48:44,169 --> 00:48:47,694
I talked to him.
He recognized my voice and knew my name.

354
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,681
That's fucked up.

355
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:56,558
The lab report just came back.
They confirmed that three passengers.

356
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:59,163
The two were officers in the vehicle.

357
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:02,436
But the third passenger in
the car was not Jericho.

358
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:07,866
Then I have to find him.

359
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:20,970
Here we go - You
change trash for cash.

360
00:49:38,907 --> 00:49:41,706
Come on. I'm hungry.

361
00:50:01,246 --> 00:50:05,436
Hello, I want this and vanilla...
Hello, Francoise.

362
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:11,122
Hello.
A grapefruit, Suikerbol and a macchiato.

363
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:15,115
- Coming.
- What did I just say?

364
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:21,596
Pamplemousse, Grapefruit, Suikerbol and coffee.
- Pampa-Mooo!

365
00:50:24,116 --> 00:50:30,588
I am speaking Spanish.
It's French, Mother fucker.

366
00:50:36,108 --> 00:50:37,312
I do not think we've met.

367
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,508
Anybody else? Anybody else?

368
00:50:45,089 --> 00:50:48,288
Call the police... Oh!...

369
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:52,099
You can not get fists world, you animal!
Anybody else?

370
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:55,612
We'll talk about after coffee.
Fuck it. Macchiato

371
00:50:55,712 --> 00:50:59,557
I think you broke my nose... Oh! Forever.
No!

372
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:03,129
- You are alright?
- Oh! No, no... you are alright.

373
00:51:37,709 --> 00:51:42,939
Hey! Do Georgia Wall books here?

374
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:47,705
- There's a queue, sir, if you do not mind.
- That's right, and I'm the lips sweet face.

375
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:51,195
Maybe you can tell me
where is this...

376
00:51:56,061 --> 00:52:01,209
Fourth floor Section 41.
Fourth floor! Fourth floor!

377
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:04,045
Sorry.

378
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:39,601
This is not right. Where's the bag Billy?
Where's the bag?

379
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:45,110
God!

380
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:52,516
Guys, someone logged in as Billy.

381
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,925
Some must be Jericho.

382
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:03,362
- Lock it.
- No... leave him.

383
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:07,846
- I want to see what he is searching for?
- I can not get into the account..

384
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:12,105
What is the access point?
Terminal one in Public Librariy..

385
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:27,318
- It is this. This one.
- Okay.

386
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:33,259
It looks like he accessed our
telephone tracking software.

387
00:53:35,594 --> 00:53:36,958
Dr. Franks.

388
00:53:40,298 --> 00:53:44,026
Hello - it is Quaker.
Jericho is on his way...

389
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:47,070
We have your location, do not hang up.
Do you understand me?

390
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:50,274
- Do not hang up.
- I understand.

391
00:54:02,746 --> 00:54:06,056
What's up, doc?
I need more of these pills.

392
00:54:06,758 --> 00:54:11,405
Without those pills Bill Pope
makes my head broken inside.

393
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:13,869
You remember? I remeber. My fuck ..
Breaks my skull in two...

394
00:54:14,065 --> 00:54:16,677
My head bursts apart
just like yours...

395
00:54:16,701 --> 00:54:20,451
Unless you find out how you can
help me. Yes. Yes. Ofcourse.

396
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:25,284
Where to? Do not say
I do not hear anything.

397
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:28,643
Pharmacy, near the down road.
Good.

398
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:32,349
Let us go.

399
00:54:47,198 --> 00:54:49,166
Hello, Dr. Franks.

400
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:59,175
Hey! Hey! Just hurry up, yes.
That was mean, I'm sorry.

401
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:06,531
Do you hear that? I'm sorry. As Billy
talking not me Yah! He fucked up my name.

402
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:09,323
Billy Pope's personality is
affecting your behavior.

403
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:12,786
And a damn know about Billy, I know
nothing about that. All I know is that...

404
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:16,190
I'm living this. I can do stuff.
It was you, Alright!

405
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:18,290
Do not want to put stuff in
my head, I try to...

406
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:21,453
You have skills.
That's right, I do math now.

407
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:24,457
I talk languages, I know what
I want and I do what I want.

408
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:26,254
Everything is different. I am grand new.

409
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:28,575
Memories are chronological?
I do not know.

410
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,704
They are triggered by things...
I say, I smell.

411
00:55:30,804 --> 00:55:34,948
I use sometimes things just emerge.
I just need one of those pills.

412
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:36,416
All I need is...

413
00:55:38,249 --> 00:55:40,242
All I need is one pill.

414
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:46,355
Jericho! You recognize Billy's responses?
What about places, touch, smell?

415
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:50,499
What about emotions?
Yah! I met his wife and child.

416
00:55:50,595 --> 00:55:52,457
- And?
- And...

417
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:57,817
There was something.
What do you mean something?

418
00:55:58,036 --> 00:56:02,204
People always told me I
did not feel anything... this and that.

419
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:07,000
I don't know.. talking family still.
I can not... I can not do this.

420
00:56:07,098 --> 00:56:07,809
Shove.

421
00:56:16,588 --> 00:56:17,743
What about now?

422
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:22,678
Now you messed me up.
For making you better.

423
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:24,463
These are called emotions.

424
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:31,027
Whatever they are, they are not useful to
me - You do not mean much without them.

425
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:36,806
Thanks for the pills, Doc.

426
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:42,693
I need some tests from you
before the process begins to fade..

427
00:56:44,241 --> 00:56:45,410
Disappear?

428
00:56:52,324 --> 00:56:57,437
How much time do I have?
48 hours, I do not know.

429
00:56:58,263 --> 00:57:00,205
Maybe I can make it longer.

430
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:02,873
Then I'd better go right now.
I have things to do.

431
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:04,804
Make money to find. Money?

432
00:57:05,003 --> 00:57:09,264
Yes, a big bag full money.
- What will you do with money, when you find it?

433
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:16,631
I don't know.
Buy .. Buy a house you know!

434
00:57:17,173 --> 00:57:22,556
A TV. One vacation like other people, right!
- Of course.

435
00:57:24,856 --> 00:57:26,090
Take what you owe.

436
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,993
- On the house, sir.
- Cheers.

437
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:32,031
Who says now Cheers?

438
00:57:57,925 --> 00:57:59,917
Ruiza, you still have 20 pounds
for Arsenal.

439
00:58:00,184 --> 00:58:01,967
I think it's fair if you pay me, right!

440
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:03,978
That's enough.

441
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:10,140
You remember everything, right?
Where is the Dutchman?

442
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:16,280
I do not know.
But I know how I have a single break.

443
00:58:45,017 --> 00:58:48,716
I do not know what you guys do, but
have stop beating him.

444
00:58:48,981 --> 00:58:50,171
Especially in the head.

445
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:54,353
Yah! I get the point.
But he is coming along.

446
00:58:54,612 --> 00:58:57,162
So who am I to do now?
Is it Bill Pope?

447
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,337
No, it's Jericho, influenced
by Billy's memories...

448
00:59:01,786 --> 00:59:04,363
- Skills, routines.
- Routines?

449
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:05,555
Yah! Routines.

450
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,590
If routines. Basically what we do in life
I is reduced to subconscious routines.

451
00:59:08,614 --> 00:59:12,647
It is these things that make the
leap of Bill Pope to Jericho.

452
00:59:13,085 --> 00:59:15,687
He makes it with money.
A bag which is driving him.

453
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:18,038
Offer that money.
And he will give you everything you want.

454
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:20,285
Take him to the last
place you had to Dutch.

455
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:23,053
Trigger memories of Billy
Pope and follow the trail.

456
00:59:23,253 --> 00:59:25,275
A source from the Lubyanka
Square just gave it to us.

457
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:27,822
The Dutchman wants to make
a deal with the Russians.

458
00:59:27,922 --> 00:59:30,193
He is going to give
proof today at 6 PM.

459
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:34,005
Did you hear that? We're fucked.

460
00:59:34,105 --> 00:59:38,934
Becaused, you wanted a psychopath finish
that instead of a hero from SEAL things.

461
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:49,324
<b>Three hours until the deadline.</b>

462
01:00:11,531 --> 01:00:14,594
The ransom money... in the bag.

463
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:17,604
You take us to the
Dutchman and it is yours.

464
01:00:20,498 --> 01:00:21,538
Do we have a deal?

465
01:00:25,103 --> 01:00:26,286
Do we have a deal?

466
01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:36,725
That! That!

467
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,690
Yah! The beach.

468
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:44,675
That too. I want to go there.

469
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:51,490
Okay! Okay! You... you can go to the beach.
Now, We have a deal?

470
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,818
Yah!

471
01:01:02,573 --> 01:01:03,887
- Don't shoot.
- Don't shoot..

472
01:01:06,294 --> 01:01:07,183
Stop! Down.

473
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,533
Only you can put out as spy.

474
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:17,340
The Dutchman, where is he?
And the money is yours.

475
01:01:18,556 --> 01:01:21,190
- Wher is money?
- Corner.

476
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,224
I will get there.
And the picture.

477
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:47,528
Which way, Jericho?

478
01:01:58,964 --> 01:02:01,014
- Right.
- Right.

479
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,595
<i>Airport London.</i>

480
01:02:30,836 --> 01:02:34,063
Sir, the facial recognition
system just detect a red alert.

481
01:02:34,637 --> 01:02:37,318
Pull over. Stop.

482
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:47,219
Put the convicted waiting and send it home.
That's it!

483
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:51,626
The Dutch has been right
in the city airport MI5...

484
01:02:51,826 --> 01:02:52,982
We have to go.

485
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:59,179
Hey, hey! My money.
Hey, what about my money?

486
01:04:02,527 --> 01:04:05,714
Elsa, he is yours now.
I need him alive.

487
01:04:08,869 --> 01:04:10,122
I'm afraid it's not your man.

488
01:04:29,853 --> 01:04:33,101
- I'm wounded.
- Give me the gun.

489
01:04:44,354 --> 01:04:45,717
Don't kill.

490
01:05:57,601 --> 01:06:01,160
Sir! A team of drivers
searching Jericho's body.

491
01:06:02,907 --> 01:06:04,564
What a fucked mess.

492
01:06:05,563 --> 01:06:07,979
The Russians can not be
allowed to make the buy.

493
01:06:08,946 --> 01:06:13,508
Check their embassy. Anything in,
anything out will be filtered, clear!

494
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:14,480
Yes Sir!

495
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,157
Heimdahl bastard that of
our aims from the start.

496
01:06:17,888 --> 01:06:21,422
I want new pass
codes, new firewalls...

497
01:06:21,993 --> 01:06:25,816
Switch to military channels, understand?
Yes, Sir.

498
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,813
<b>One hour to deadline </b>.

499
01:06:32,713 --> 01:06:35,713
<i>Today, Cannon

<i>Several people were
seriously injured.</i>

501
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:44,413
The authorities still searching for
bodies fell into the River Thames.

502
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,364
I'm sorry that I lost it.

503
01:06:48,486 --> 01:06:51,136
- Maybe if I...
- If, if, if... if.

504
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:56,928
If you had kept closer to the Dutchman,
may be now we already had the wormhole.

505
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:04,528
I must say I'm not that
happy at the moment, Elsa.

506
01:07:05,836 --> 01:07:07,726
- Do you want me to leave?
- No.

507
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:15,085
I apologize.

508
01:07:16,926 --> 01:07:17,926
Good.

509
01:07:26,471 --> 01:07:28,333
We need to find Jericho.

510
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:23,094
Mommy, can I watch TV?
Sure, sweetie.

511
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,125
What are you doing in my basement?

512
01:09:26,644 --> 01:09:27,998
What is all this?

513
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:31,814
That belongs to Emma.

514
01:09:35,409 --> 01:09:36,738
Did you work with Billy?

515
01:09:37,655 --> 01:09:38,914
I do not think...

516
01:09:40,023 --> 01:09:43,074
Someone like him ever worked
with someone like me..

517
01:09:44,844 --> 01:09:48,008
They stuck Billy in my head.

518
01:09:48,993 --> 01:09:50,641
I have a scar, you see?

519
01:09:52,202 --> 01:09:57,350
All stuff he knew, all stuff he could do
I have mixed up inside me.

520
01:09:59,376 --> 01:10:00,564
That's impossible.

521
01:10:02,558 --> 01:10:04,606
The first car you too have bought...

522
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:11,105
Used Rover. Smelled like fish and
chips. The clutch marred the first week...

523
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:15,297
Of course I did not have
the $ 100 to fix it.

524
01:10:16,393 --> 01:10:20,810
I told you, they put his brain in me.
Thats enough.

525
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:25,937
Mom, where are you? I'm hungry.
Just a second, baby.

526
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,090
Sunday night.

527
01:10:31,312 --> 01:10:32,671
Chicken and waffles.

528
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:36,622
You doing the chicken, the waffles.

529
01:10:37,856 --> 01:10:40,667
I know she likes the syrup
in the bottom only.

530
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:46,943
I see pieces that pop up suddenly...

531
01:10:48,092 --> 01:10:49,400
At different places.

532
01:10:50,848 --> 01:10:51,995
I see things.

533
01:10:53,318 --> 01:10:55,151
Do not ask me how they did it, but...

534
01:10:57,196 --> 01:10:59,802
- They did.
- Why?

535
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:02,192
Aah!

536
01:11:02,937 --> 01:11:07,096
They're looking details of a place where
your husband hid a guy before he was killed.

537
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,618
Now, ..you to take care of.
I'll finish here.

538
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:28,057
I'll finish here and go away.
Leave me alone.

539
01:11:42,084 --> 01:11:45,368
Billy could never hurt
you, so can I?

540
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:48,141
<b>Off the coast of Portugal.</b>

541
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,614
<b>USS VIRGINIA SSN743.</b>

542
01:13:20,675 --> 01:13:22,692
Armed missile to port, sir.

543
01:13:23,447 --> 01:13:24,550
That's not possible.

544
01:13:24,624 --> 01:13:26,834
Guidance systems are to go.
Tracking system to go.

545
01:13:26,934 --> 01:13:27,837
Turn them off.

546
01:13:29,588 --> 01:13:31,320
I can not, we are blocked sir.

547
01:13:38,854 --> 01:13:41,505
Missile fired. I repeat, missile fired.

548
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:49,445
Send self-destruct code
before it reaches its target.

549
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:52,623
Alpha 30, Echo 40, Bravo Hotel.

550
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:56,016
Negative..., not responding.

551
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:15,063
It's good! It destroyed! It's good!

552
01:14:17,968 --> 01:14:21,053
Jesus Christ.
We do not fired that missile, sir.

553
01:14:39,696 --> 01:14:41,895
Did you know I lost my daddy?

554
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,688
Yah!

555
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:49,848
He gave me Ellie, for my birthday.

556
01:14:52,316 --> 01:14:54,713
If we do not dig deeper,
its trunk sticking out.

557
01:14:55,466 --> 01:14:56,466
Do deeper.

558
01:15:01,846 --> 01:15:02,886
Are you hurt?

559
01:15:12,784 --> 01:15:13,784
Stop.

560
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,627
Emma, come here please!

561
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:19,615
No mommy, we bury Ellie.
Come here.

562
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,727
He said he was a friend of daddy.

563
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,644
Go away, please.

564
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:31,213
Can you stay for dinner? He is nice.

565
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:33,722
Emma, go inside.

566
01:15:42,576 --> 01:15:44,195
I make waffles and then I go.

567
01:16:04,049 --> 01:16:05,065
Come and play.

568
01:16:05,643 --> 01:16:07,890
- What?
- Come play.

569
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:13,625
- I do not know.
- I'll teach you.

570
01:16:18,316 --> 01:16:22,039
I do not know if this is a good idea.
Fine. Come on.

571
01:16:26,244 --> 01:16:27,244
Come on.

572
01:16:33,536 --> 01:16:35,655
Just put your hands well.

573
01:16:37,647 --> 01:16:38,953
Put your hand there and touch.

574
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:40,699
And then you do...

575
01:16:47,602 --> 01:16:48,602
That's okay.

576
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:03,814
That's good and again.

577
01:17:08,687 --> 01:17:12,953
Emma, it's late.
It's time to go to bed.

578
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:15,672
Yes, Mommy. Good night, Jericho.

579
01:17:18,172 --> 01:17:20,247
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, honey.

580
01:17:33,745 --> 01:17:34,809
Who are you?

581
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:40,428
I don't know.

582
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,864
Most of my life a number.

583
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,670
My brains do not always work well.

584
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,861
I have not always done well.

585
01:17:54,655 --> 01:17:56,869
Having your husband
in my head made me...

586
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:01,425
It made me feel things.
Knowing things.

587
01:18:03,187 --> 01:18:05,167
Right, wrong.

588
01:18:07,246 --> 01:18:10,588
I guess it does not matter.
The doctor says it will disappears soon.

589
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:15,151
Can you tell me what Billy felt?

590
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:20,341
Can you?

591
01:18:32,168 --> 01:18:33,332
That's too much!

592
01:18:33,532 --> 01:18:36,412
There was something funny
that Billy used to do.

593
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,657
That was our signal that he loved me.

594
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:45,376
I...

595
01:18:46,693 --> 01:18:49,535
I know... I Know.

596
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:54,685
I know with that what is supposed
to be in the night...

597
01:18:56,847 --> 01:18:59,415
But I never... Our wedding day.

598
01:19:00,751 --> 01:19:01,751
Do you remember?

599
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:05,221
Yes.

600
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:07,879
The beach.

601
01:19:08,299 --> 01:19:12,852
The first time you gave to Emma.
I was so happy.

602
01:19:13,654 --> 01:19:17,364
Yah!... I... I have...

603
01:19:18,734 --> 01:19:22,076
I... I feel it... I feel it.

604
01:19:28,945 --> 01:19:29,993
He loves you.

605
01:19:31,437 --> 01:19:32,643
So much.

606
01:19:41,088 --> 01:19:42,485
Where will you go now?

607
01:19:45,251 --> 01:19:46,926
I don't know. Where...

608
01:19:48,013 --> 01:19:49,687
Where ...he takes me.

609
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:55,636
Then stay here.
You can stay on the couch.

610
01:20:02,412 --> 01:20:05,006
It would not be the first
time on that couch.

611
01:20:12,336 --> 01:20:17,083
<i>Our Top Story: A mysterious missile was
launched off the coast of Portugal.</i>

612
01:20:17,195 --> 01:20:19,837
<i>The question is where did
the missile come from.</i>

613
01:20:27,099 --> 01:20:32,084
Good morning. I brought you some fresh coffee.
- Thanks.

614
01:20:37,408 --> 01:20:40,368
Do not worry about it.
It's okay.

615
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:45,950
Where the missile came from. We do
not know who will be held responsible.

616
01:20:57,747 --> 01:21:03,592
You work at the university. There is a cage
in the library. A bookcase with a key.

617
01:21:03,616 --> 01:21:07,097
Yes, there are rare books...
Billy and I used to go there sometimes..

618
01:21:07,244 --> 01:21:09,665
Why? Does this have something to do with...
Yes... Yes.

619
01:21:11,501 --> 01:21:14,532
Jilly. I need a car.

620
01:21:14,683 --> 01:21:16,883
And the key to the book.
Oh! Sure..

621
01:21:23,168 --> 01:21:26,462
We'll have Jill money, lots of money.

622
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:37,524
I wish I could keep him.

623
01:22:00,424 --> 01:22:04,168
Emma, come upstairs, please.
I am coming.

624
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,628
Come, You must take a shower.

625
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:10,700
Have you done down the door?
Yes.

626
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:26,313
Where is Jericho?

627
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:53,188
You're the guy, who killed me.

628
01:23:54,037 --> 01:23:55,323
Good memory.

629
01:23:56,246 --> 01:23:57,247
Yah!

630
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:04,523
If you hurt me, I'll do worse.

631
01:24:05,736 --> 01:24:07,140
I respect your belief.

632
01:24:08,839 --> 01:24:10,093
And you do well..

633
01:24:18,683 --> 01:24:19,689
On there.

634
01:24:39,732 --> 01:24:41,161
Sir, I have something.

635
01:24:41,688 --> 01:24:44,021
Akhmadov, Russian FSB operative.

636
01:24:44,633 --> 01:24:47,464
What makes arriving in a
fishing boat in Dagana?

637
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:51,394
It seems that is not stupid enough
to try it alone from the embassy.

638
01:24:52,002 --> 01:24:54,604
They are bringing a team to grab
and pick up the Dutchman!

639
01:24:54,755 --> 01:24:56,306
Put me in the air, now!

640
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:15,326
Stay in 1-11. They're
heading right toward us.

641
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:18,882
We follow the Russians.
They will lead us to the Dutchman.

642
01:25:23,596 --> 01:25:25,931
I do not particularly like children.

643
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:28,574
They never meet expectations.
Jericho.

644
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:31,112
Jericho! Help us, please.
Boarding.

645
01:25:31,312 --> 01:25:34,094
No!... Please!

646
01:25:35,508 --> 01:25:41,771
Stop! .. No more violence
No more violence. Get him.

647
01:25:44,738 --> 01:25:46,240
Take me to the Dutchman.

648
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:51,747
He's in there.

649
01:26:03,544 --> 01:26:04,798
Let me see thermal images.

650
01:26:12,716 --> 01:26:17,089
The Russian team was in the other truck.
We follow them, navigate.

651
01:26:18,953 --> 01:26:24,169
All units, we are in a covert persecution
Do not approach. Understood.

652
01:26:33,597 --> 01:26:35,746
There, at the university.

653
01:26:36,494 --> 01:26:40,397
Do not approach until we see the Dutchman.
All units, they are not approachable.

654
01:26:50,953 --> 01:26:53,122
Let's go!

655
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:03,391
Team Snipers, what is your position?

656
01:27:03,582 --> 01:27:05,050
Sniper team on move.

657
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,544
Sir, we have Heimdahl and Jericho.
Follow me. Follow me.

658
01:27:24,644 --> 01:27:26,890
All units, come.
Disable the Russian team.

659
01:27:27,001 --> 01:27:28,719
We need Jericho alive.

660
01:27:41,983 --> 01:27:43,659
Your wife and child just died.

661
01:27:50,556 --> 01:27:52,112
Put this thing on the ground.

662
01:27:53,783 --> 01:27:56,461
Your man is not there. They do not have.
What do you mean?

663
01:27:56,552 --> 01:27:58,058
I just said they dion't have it.

664
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:03,451
I just told you. He's up there. Alright.
They do not have...

665
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:11,511
I'll go. Go to the airfield.
You need to get out of here.

666
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:13,806
Get to Dutch. I'll see you there.

667
01:28:23,206 --> 01:28:24,306
CHEMISTRY LAB

668
01:28:24,393 --> 01:28:26,639
- Where are we going?
- Over here.

669
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:29,467
Jillians office.

670
01:28:35,705 --> 01:28:36,705
Where is he?

671
01:28:37,769 --> 01:28:39,277
In the corner office.

672
01:28:42,377 --> 01:28:44,077
GLICERINA

673
01:28:47,877 --> 01:28:49,777
NITRIC ACID

674
01:29:03,115 --> 01:29:04,123
Get out.

675
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:46,633
Don't kill me.
- Shut up, you do not know me, but I know you.

676
01:29:46,776 --> 01:29:51,449
You and Pope have made a deal.
He's dead, but he is making it good.

677
01:29:54,124 --> 01:29:55,172
That's your money.

678
01:29:56,668 --> 01:29:57,700
Your passport.

679
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:11,513
Passport.

680
01:30:11,608 --> 01:30:15,866
The wormhole. Where is it?
It's still in my computer.

681
01:30:15,992 --> 01:30:17,199
- Set it now.
- No problem.

682
01:30:21,297 --> 01:30:25,390
Do exactly what I tell and maybe
live to spend all this money.

683
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:38,965
You're a fucking genius.

684
01:30:42,124 --> 01:30:45,330
This is some thing of crazy .. here..

685
01:30:45,616 --> 01:30:49,479
Live by the sword, Die by the sword.
Brilliant.

686
01:30:55,094 --> 01:30:57,365

691
01:31:11,207 --> 01:31:15,585
Give to Heimdall
Vigilant Shield is fucking crazy.

<i>Elsa</i> - I got it, I'm on my way.

693
01:31:25,302 --> 01:31:29,000
The Dutchman and Jericho are dead.
<i>Good girl. I'll be waiting for you </i>.

694
01:31:31,991 --> 01:31:35,412
<i>Elsa? Elsa?</i>

Do you need an ambulance, sir.
Wait here. I immediately send a nurse.

697
01:32:05,636 --> 01:32:06,935
Okay.

698
01:32:23,921 --> 01:32:24,929
Who is that?

699
01:32:39,238 --> 01:32:40,261
She's dead.

700
01:32:45,162 --> 01:32:49,368
Yes. Here. Take the computer.

701
01:32:49,559 --> 01:32:51,915
Have a Scan of her.
Stolen ambulance right outside.

702
01:32:52,103 --> 01:32:53,039
A wounded man took it.

703
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:55,518
Fits the description of Jericho.
Jericho ...started...

704
01:32:55,618 --> 01:32:56,464
On our way.

705
01:32:56,564 --> 01:32:57,246
Communicting in front of .. ambulance.

706
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:07,215
Elsa.
Does it sound to you like Elsa, Fucker.

707
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:08,067
Where is she?

708
01:33:08,136 --> 01:33:10,400
I ended up with it. She is dead.

709
01:33:10,575 --> 01:33:13,839
Fuck her. I have what you wanted.
This is what will happen.

710
01:33:13,935 --> 01:33:17,870
Are you dictating terms to me?
That's right, psycho.

711
01:33:18,496 --> 01:33:19,697
Get the little girl.

712
01:33:20,215 --> 01:33:26,001
I will send you instructions. You come
here and give me the flash drive...

713
01:33:26,723 --> 01:33:29,065
Or they die. Say something.

714
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,096
Jericho, help. He's seeking. Do something.
Hi.

715
01:33:32,207 --> 01:33:36,596
She will be the first, so her
mommy can watch. You understand?

716
01:33:37,101 --> 01:33:40,325
I'll fuck you up. I'll fuck you up.

717
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,539
Jericho! Jericho!

718
01:33:58,363 --> 01:34:04,112
Do not give him the USB flash drive, you understand
me? He destroys the earth. Do you hear me?

719
01:34:05,426 --> 01:34:09,199
I have it figured out.
Jericho, you have not been figured.

720
01:34:09,294 --> 01:34:12,685
You are here ...temporary.
You're not Bill Pope.

721
01:34:12,786 --> 01:34:16,961
He has a gun over her head.
He has a gun...

722
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:23,030
On the baby. I can not remember her name.
Emma.

723
01:34:23,509 --> 01:34:26,072
Her name is Emma.
Connect me with the ambulance radio.

724
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,350
You're on. Here he can hear you.
Jericho, Dr. Franks.

725
01:34:29,631 --> 01:34:33,584
I can undo implantation.
You can be normal.

726
01:34:33,638 --> 01:34:35,196
We need to do it now.

727
01:34:35,311 --> 01:34:38,562
Before it's gone, turn around
and come back to see me.

728
01:34:40,817 --> 01:34:41,902
What about Jill?

729
01:34:42,102 --> 01:34:45,203
Let somebody at stake.
There are more lives. We all will die.

730
01:34:45,485 --> 01:34:47,485
Let them, they do not matter.

731
01:34:48,588 --> 01:34:49,898
But it matters to me!

732
01:35:39,892 --> 01:35:40,995
A little closer.

733
01:36:06,282 --> 01:36:08,178
<i>Officer to the ground!
Officer to the ground!</i>

734
01:36:08,285 --> 01:36:10,243
<i>Medical units... hit the Gas tank.</i>

735
01:36:24,671 --> 01:36:27,393
He is getting close, so
let's get ready.

736
01:36:59,592 --> 01:37:01,164
Jericho.

737
01:37:18,619 --> 01:37:20,037
It has Emma!

738
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:31,317
Put it down.

739
01:37:34,358 --> 01:37:35,911
Put it down.

740
01:37:48,434 --> 01:37:49,717
Give me the flash drive.

741
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:07,756
Emma. Run.

742
01:38:41,905 --> 01:38:43,731
What are the coordinates down there?

743
01:38:44,429 --> 01:38:48,494
I have... reasons
to be new to them.

744
01:38:56,759 --> 01:38:59,184
<b>ACCESS CODES ACCEPTED LAUNCH
PROTOCOL ACTIVATED.</b>

745
01:39:17,262 --> 01:39:18,477
<i>- Quaker.
- I listen.</i>

746
01:39:18,643 --> 01:39:22,373
Heimdahl has fired a missile,
100 kilometers north of you.

747
01:39:22,826 --> 01:39:25,468
Evacuate area. Get out.

748
01:39:28,564 --> 01:39:30,673
Hey! Do you have any idea
what you've done? He is stiil...

749
01:39:31,458 --> 01:39:36,818
You've killed them all...
What are you doing?

750
01:39:36,913 --> 01:39:37,913
Backwards.

751
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,516
Do not worry so much. I mean...

752
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:46,412
I made that guy fix.

753
01:39:46,531 --> 01:39:48,285
Who? I don't remember his name..

754
01:39:48,388 --> 01:39:52,677
Jan Stroop? Dutchman? The Dutchman?
Yah! Yah!

755
01:39:52,913 --> 01:39:54,530
Yah, the Dutchman is Fixed.

756
01:39:54,829 --> 01:39:56,389
Fixed what?

757
01:39:56,489 --> 01:39:59,326
Jericho! Jericho!

758
01:39:59,526 --> 01:40:00,897
What is the Dutchman fixed?

759
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,142
Heimdahls first shot.

760
01:40:08,408 --> 01:40:12,603
What it was, he tried
to steer around.

761
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:14,787
It comes back for him.

762
01:40:18,024 --> 01:40:19,826
I told that bastard:

763
01:40:21,286 --> 01:40:24,539
"You hurt me.
I have to be worse."

764
01:40:25,221 --> 01:40:26,221
Coming.

765
01:40:50,156 --> 01:40:52,818
I'm cold in the head.

766
01:40:58,205 --> 01:40:59,057
I'm cold.

767
01:41:46,873 --> 01:41:50,301
Are you sure about this?
Yes, he has been responding.

768
01:41:51,091 --> 01:41:53,010
Maybe this despolete something.

769
01:41:53,648 --> 01:41:57,469
If he remembers anything,
Bill Pope remains here to stay.

770
01:42:37,704 --> 01:42:41,506
You might not be remembering,
but I know you.

771
01:43:33,763 --> 01:43:36,462
It's incredible, he remembers.

772
01:43:38,009 --> 01:43:40,015
Then relase him now He moves.

773
01:43:42,699 --> 01:43:44,845
I will give him offering a job.
