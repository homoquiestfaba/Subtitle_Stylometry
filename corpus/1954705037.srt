To tell you the truth ... it's embarrassing.

169
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,675
Grandma ...

Enzyme levels on the way up. Enzyme levels are at max.

00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,066
Shit.

You are not the same person.

190
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:52,645
I want to know every version of Dean that was before he left went.

191
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,457
- Where is Rhonda? -Sover Still. Did you sleep okay?

To keep.

201
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,953
This time, Grandma? What do you say?

202
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:46,425
Your grandfather told me a story once. If two monks.

203
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,549
One old and one young, who went along.

204
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:54,762
Did you know that monks are not allowed to have someone contact with women?

205
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:54,770
No, I did not know.

No, I did not know.

207
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:03,103
They see a woman standing by a stream. She seems stuck in there.

208
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:03,112
She seems to want to go over, but she wears a long skirt.

212
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:18,661
And five hours later saying the young monk:

213
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:24,917
"Why are you wearing that woman?" And the old monk says:

214
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:24,925
"I put her down for several hours ago. Why are you wearing her still?"

00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,271
- Maintain. Yes. Okay.

226
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,605
Forgive me for interrupting. Dean, you have to look at something.

We take a break, okay? I'll be right back.

229
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:44,209
- How long has she been like this? Thio minutes?

230
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,299
Rhonda, do you hear me?

231
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,768
- Oh my God! -Keep Her down!

232
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,936
Take her feet! Give me something to put in her mouth! Fort!

233
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,575
We need to get her to the hospital. Where is it coming?

234
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,619
Nearly five mil away.

235
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,701
No! No!

236
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,872
Then it starts.

237
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,685
- What's wrong? -No Gasoline.

238
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,902

240
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:07,579
- Any idea what the hell it is? She has no allergies.

241
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:07,584
That illness that comes from musskit? I have seen mice here. Hantavirus?
- Any idea what the hell it is? She has no allergies.

242

That illness that comes from musskit? I have seen mice here. Hantavirus?

243
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:16,009
- It is not true. -How Do we know we are not infected?

244
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:23,183
- We do not know. It was very reassuring.

245
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:31,605
Rhonda was good last night. Had a nosebleed at 8 am this morning.

246
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,733
- KI 13, she could not walk. Five hours. -When She got eliminated?

247
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:41,956
Half an hour later. So the bleeding. It sounds like a virus.

248
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,805
Is she really ...

249
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,270
- She has gone mad! -Lugna You, Rhonda.

250
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,082
- Are you crazy? -You Saw that she attacked me!

251
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,424
- Travis, what did you do? -That I must do.

252
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,552
- It was under control. Do not say so out!

253
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,645
Travis, you're an idiot.

254
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,936
- She's dead. Is she dead? -Download A sheet.

255
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,149
- Do not. -Get A sheet!

256
00:30:59,149 --> 00:30:59,150
Well it was self-defense? Y'all?
- Do not. -Get A sheet!

257
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,278
Well it was self-defense? Y'all?

258
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,966
Give me your phones. Come on!

259
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,054
This did not happen.

260
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,183
Come on, Izz.

261
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:32,524

262
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,653
- Travis, just go! -Go!

263
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,948
Where are you going?

264
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:54,372
Her sister is getting married in June.

265
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,593
I know this is difficult.

266
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,798
It can not be denied.

267
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,096
Rhonda is not the first friend I lost.

268
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:17,354
There will be time to grieve later, now we must focus on getting from here.

269
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,399
Okay?

270
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,574
It would she liked.

00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,300
Come on.

272
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,505
Yes! Yes.

00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,809
- The switch, 112. What is your emergency? We need help!

274
00:32:54,931 --> 00:33:00,145

How about a little love?

283
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,939
Izzy, he compensates only.

284
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:43,944
Really?
Izzy, he compensates only.

285
00:33:43,944 --> 00:33:45,941

00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:27,654
- I will be like Rhonda. What happened?

287
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,945

294
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:49,597
- Did you hear that, Izz. It will be good. Shall we take a walk?

295
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,531
I'm afraid.

296
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,698
Izz, look at me.

297
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,920
I will not leave you.

298
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,083
I let nothing happen to you.

299
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,172

... Through blood transfusion.

Get in the car.

502
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,837
I just have to do one more thing.

503
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,219
Goodbye, Grandma.

504
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:56,395
- We are on the way. Be ready for us. -Take Her to me.

505
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:01,646
- Are you okay? I'm fine.

506
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,902
- I need your help. What are we gonna do?

507
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,995
You should go to the school house.

508
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:15,243
Go down the hatch that goes into a tunnel that goes to the mine. Are you listening?

509
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:19,372
I take lobster with Mandy, you meet us there.

510
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:25,669

Show route.

515
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,704
- Stay with me, baby. Almost there. -where Is she?

516
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,087
- She's here. Excuse me?

517
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:50,091
- You did well to have Sarah's DNA? I wanted her alive.
- She's here. Excuse me?

518
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:55,309
- You did well to have Sarah's DNA? I wanted her alive.

519
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,348
So do I.

520
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,524
- May I? -No. Not yet.

521
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:10,867
So young, with so much blood on his hands. How many have you killed so far?

522
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,028
Why does she?

523
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,205
Why Sarah?

524
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:24,538
Every year we flnkammar earth for new and rare bacteria.

527
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:33,839
We discovered an abnormally potent species that grew in your grandmother's basement.

528
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:33,840
Sarah was breathing contaminated air in a decade without getting a single symptom.

Sarah was breathing contaminated air in a decade without getting a single symptom.

530
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:42,223
No man is capable of those exposures.

531
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:47,353
But she did it. So you think she is immune.

532
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:53,693
You manufactures a virus and losing her DNA and make a vaccine.

533
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:56,821
- Waiting for me not understanding. -You Played with my grandmother IIV.

534
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:00,996
You do not see the beauty of it. Detecting any d?dligt-

535
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:04,120
-t?mja it, and then eradicate it.

536
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,249
As long as there ?nns diseases need people like me.

537
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:12,503
- People who challenge nature's worst. You're killing innocent.

538
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:17,599
You harfel, Dean. I do not IIV, I'm saving them.

539
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:22,813
Mandy! Mandy! Breathe. You save them?

540
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:28,059
I was spared once. I know what it's like to lose.

541
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:28,065
And I am aware of the extreme acts it can get a man to commit.

Beautiful, is not it?

545
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:09,819
The spores began as a simple Ieveranssystem to the virus. Vector.

546
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:17,110
But they adapted and became something much more complex.

547
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,543
Preparations?

548
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,755
The moment of truth.

549
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,006
Start chemical washing and biodekonstruktion.

__ It is Iivsduglig. Transfer it to manufacture.

554
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,585
Okay, give it to her.

555
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,704
Now.

Antiserum introduced into the bloodstream.

557

559
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,586
- Now we are taking over. What?

560

You have fulfilled your contract terms. Final payment is transferred to your account.

561
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,887
You're free to go.

562
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:32,095
You can not take me from the project. It's just the beginning.

563
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:32,103
I'm afraid it's already done, Dr. Locke.

This was not your fight.

566
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:28,359

The world will always need someone who kills masses, Dean.

01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:06,289
- The game is over, Locke. You're not a soldier anymore, Dean.

607
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:12,495
- I said that it is not your fight. -You Did that to my battle.
