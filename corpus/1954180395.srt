a nigger, a kike and a wop

and they get surrounded by Indians.

3
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,569
The chief walks to them.
He says, "Listen, we're gonna kill you,

we're gonna boil you.

"But you get one final request."

7
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:53,246
So the chief walks up to the nigger, and
of course he orders a bucket of chicken.

8
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,381
He eats it, he's killed.

9
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:59,619
They skin him, they boil him, and
they make a canoe out of him.

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,857
So the chief goes up to the
Jew, "What do you wish for?"

11
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,359
He says "I'll have
a knish and a bagel."

12
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,261
But he takes his time eating it.

13
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,563
Then they kill him,
they skin him, they boil him,

14
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,832
they make a canoe out of him.

15
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,602
And finally, the chief
walks up to the wop.

16
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,870
He says, "What do you want?"

17
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,906
The Italian says, "I want a fork."

18
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,642
The chief says,
"What do you want a fork for?

19
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,410
"You don't want something else?"

20
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,714
The Italian says,
"No, give me a fork!"

21
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,616
He says, "We don't have a fork!"

22
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,483
He says, "Find me a fucking fork!"

23
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,354
So the chief goes out,

24
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:41,461
finds him a fork, he brings
it over, hands it to him.

25
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:45,398
He walks straight up to the chief.
He says, "Here's your fucking canoe!

00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,225
I'm gonna try to, uh, find
you a better mattress, too.

176
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,960
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

177
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,495
All right, well, you know,
make yourself at home, dude.

178
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,330
Oh, the toilet's broken

179
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,500
so, if you wanna flush it,

180
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,635
you gotta jiggle the, the bar
and if that, that doesn't work,

181
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,404
you gotta lift the ball inside.
Yeah, no problem.

182
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,339
But I'm serious about this
because the whole thing will...

183
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,880
Will flood if you don't...
All right.

184
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,688
I got it. It's good.

185

FRANK: You want a beer?

186
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,365
Here, an ashtray.

187
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,737
You know those guys?

188
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,838
No.

189
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,212
So, uh, how was
first day at the lot?

190
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,716
It was okay.

191
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,325
It's a start though, right?

192
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,194
I'm sure something...
Something better's gonna come up.

193
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,174
These guys don't look familiar to you?
Frank, do me a favor.

194
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,235
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

195
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,346
Stranger?

196
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,214
Jesus Christ, you scared me, man.

197
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,051
What do you say, Chris!
What are you doing, man?

198
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,252
Whoa!
Hey.

199
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,820
It's about fucking time, man.

200
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,321
How you're doing?
Look at you, man!

201
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,690
Oh, man.
I'm doing all right now.

202
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,759
What about Big Sal?

203
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,829
Oh, man! You won't be seeing
him around here no more.

204
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,331
He bought a bar,
over in Manhattan.

205
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,666
He's doing all right.

206
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,835
I hear he plays poker
with the DA these days.

207
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,456
Can you imagine?
That scumbag.

208
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,653
What about you, Chris?
Any plans?

209
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,343
Keep the judge happy.

210
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,928
Here where it says "print" and then
the timing when she got here...

211
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,489
I'm gonna... I'm also gonna give
you some forms to fill out.

212
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,162
So, please fill these out.

213
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,583
You keep the pen.
Thank you.

(WHISPERING) What are
you doing here?

215
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,206
Well, I didn't know
you worked there.

216
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,842
I just wanted to see
how you was doing.

217
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,546
What do you want from
me, huh? He's in jail.

218
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,948
Don't you feel like you fucked
things up enough already?

219
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,549
Hey, wait a second. He is the
one who fucked things up!

220
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,350
Get out of here!

221

223
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,597
I've seen you.

224
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,868
What do you want, Frank?

225
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,274
Okay. (SIGHING)

226
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,708
I been thinking about you a lot.

227
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,177
I been thinking about
what's happened between us.

228

I been thinking about
how it ended,

229
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,647
and I've been worried about you,

230
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,315
and I wanted to see if we
could be friends, okay?

231
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,517
I just wanted to see
if I could be there for you

232
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,653
if you needed me sometime.
That's all I wanted, okay?

233
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,424
Yeah?
Yeah.

234
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,536
Can you be seen with me now?

235
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,502
Can you be seen
with the "colored girl"?

236
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,604
Come on, that's not, I...

237
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:06,805
You just said it yourself, that was
a long time ago. Yes, yes, yes.

238
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,340
And that things are different now.

239
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,721
Leave me alone.

240
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,959

Natalie, what is it?
What's the matter?

244

$40 short.

245
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,955
It's the second time in 10 days.

246
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,390
I already had to spend $50

247
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,925
out of my own pocket last week.

248
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,861
You need help recounting it?
No.

249
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,365
(SNIFFLES) No, I already counted
three goddamned times. It's gone.

250
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay, so there's 40 bucks missing.

251

It's not the end of the world.

252

Yeah, maybe not to you.

Can I ask you something?
Sure!

all the stuff for the hospital,

you always told us that

know, it's to the judge

she had in her hands.

00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:25,269
but unfortunately there's nothing
written down, right? So...

521
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,806
How... How can you say that?
I mean, just like that?

522
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:29,808
I'm sorry.

523
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,944
If it was up to me, you'd get it,
I mean, I gave you my full support.

524
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,180
So what's the problem?

525
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:39,216
Well, the mayor's been getting
these anonymous letters.

526
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,884
You know, and some of
his people have too,

527
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,020
and, you know, they're
not too happy about it.

528
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:46,323
Wait, wait. You knew about our records,
so did the commissioner, right?

529
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:49,059
Yeah, right. But, this guy,

530
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,995
you know, he's gonna make a
stink with the whole city.

531
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,663
So, I mean,
what do you want with me?

532
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,898
You said it was as good as done!
Yeah.

533
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:56,367
That's what you said! Right?
Right! I did.

534
00:43:56,368 --> 00:43:58,802
And, and I said I'm sorry!

535
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,038
And I am very sorry.

536
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:03,774
But, you know, we got
an election comin' up

537
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,409
and, the mayor, he's just...

538
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,244
(STUTTERING) I mean
it's just too risky!

539
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,380
Who sent the letters, do you know?

540
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:12,082
There's no point even telling you.

541
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:15,919
But if it's any consolation, Mike, that
guy's not gonna get the bid either...

542
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,755
I don't fucking care about that!
Mike.

543
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:21,091
What I care about is you
keeping your fuckin' word!

544
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,360
MIKE: You fucking weasel!
Don't touch me.

545
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,330
Do not ever touch me again!

546
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,198
You guys, now you're in real...

547
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,833
Now you're in real trouble!

548
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,769
This is...
Now you're in...

549
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,672
You're in such trouble!

550
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:37,141
MIKE: Fucking weasel!
Fuck you!

551
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:38,709
Fuck you!

552
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,111
You are fucked!

553
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,346
If I fuckin' had a gun...
Fuck!

554
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,768
Prick!
MIKE: Fuck!

555
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,864
What is this?

556
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,467
You're fucking serious?

557
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,839
I don't have a choice.

558
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,660
You're coming after me
with a judge now?

559
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,211
You owe me, Chris.

560
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:50,279
10 years of child support.
I was in fucking jail!

561
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,420
What do you think
you're gonna get outta me?

562
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,756
I hear you're starting a
business with your friend.

563
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,497
Yeah, well that just
went up in smoke.

564
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:06,797
I know you inside and out, Chris.

565
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:09,139
You make promises
and then you break 'em.

566
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,937
I'm telling you, I'm not
gonna let this drop,

567
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,839
because there are a lotta things.

568
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,307
Things even money can't undo.

569
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,943
What do you want from me?
What do you expect me to do?

570
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,945
I don't have anything.

571
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,413
You know, my brother has
to lend me a fucking room.

572
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,634
I'm at the end of my fucking
rope, you know that.

573
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,419
Oh, yeah. Poor thing!

574
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,223
Oh, it's been so difficult for you.
Nobody is helping you.

575
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:35,359
And you wanna change.

576
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,062
Yeah, you wanna be a nice guy now.

577
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,799
Don't give me that shit, right, you
can't change, you're trash to the core.

578
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,199
You shut your fucking mouth!

579
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,148
Go to your room, honey, okay?

580
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:53,643
MONICA: Word is you found
yourself a nice young thing.

581
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,912
Why don't you pimp her?

582
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,448
Huh? You out of practice?

583
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,911
Oh, she too good for that, right?

584
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:08,192
Me, am I too good for that?

585
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:09,959
You shut your fuckin' mouth!

586
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,232
You wanna know something?

587
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:17,967
Your new one,
she'll be hooking soon...

588
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,509
See?

589
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,846
I know you real well.
Yeah, I know you too.

590
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:32,049
You just want that money to
sniff it up your fuckin' nose!

591
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,984
No one's telling you to go on whoring.
So stop judging me!

592
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,725
(DOOR CLOSING)

593
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,736
Hey, what's the matter?

594
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,020
I think it's better
we stop seeing each other.

595
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,180
What did I do?
You didn't do anything.

596
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,316
This fuckin' pisses me off.

597
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:14,324
It pisses me off to have
to do these shitty jobs.

598
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:18,629
Pisses me off to see you
at that fucking desk.

599
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,065
And all this being with you like this,
without money, without anything.

600
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,467
It fuckin' pisses me off.

601
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,458
Can't you see I don't give
a shit about any of this?

602
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,343
I mean do you really think
that I care about money?

603
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,245
Is that how you really see me?

604
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,482
Come on, Chris, I just wanna be
with you, that's all that matters.

605
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,923
I don't care
if you bring me stuff.

606
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:48,225
It's better this way, believe me.

607
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,059
Yeah, give me a beer, please.
A Miller.

608
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,098
What'll you have?

609
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:12,683
NEWS REPORTER:
<i>So, the situation here is</i>

610
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,718
<i>we've got two crews</i>
<i>that can't get out.</i>

611
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,087
<i>We're trapped here,</i>
<i>that's the way I see it</i>

612
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:19,723
<i>and we're going to remain</i>
<i>stuck for very long time.</i>

613
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,225
<i>Did you hear what the police said?</i>

614
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:25,395
<i>We got some unbelievable news. Information
from monitoring the police scanner...</i>

615
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,562
Fuckin' pigs.

616
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,167
Shut his fuckin' mouth!

617
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:32,828
He thinks we're all fucking idiots.
Shh!

618
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,607
They wanted to kill those people,
so they fucking killed 'em.

619
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:41,044
Yeah, shut the TV off Frank.
I'm watching, Pop.

620
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:44,715
It's fucking disgusting...
Bunch of fuckin' assholes.
Shut the damn thing off!

621
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:46,316
You know, nobody's
making you watch.

622
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,985
You can go in
and help with dinner.

623
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:49,753
Oh, you're supporting the cops?
What a fucking surprise.

624
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:51,153
MARIE: Frank.

625
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,496
Hey, you don't know what the
fuck you're talking about, okay?

626
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:03,200
They had bombs inside there, they had
grenades, they came out firing shots.

627
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:05,268
If the cops fired, that means
they had no other option!

628
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:06,209
What a fucking joke.

629
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:08,372
You got no idea what
the SLA is capable of.

630
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:10,774
Your guys slaughtered them
like fucking animals.

631
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:13,143
I didn't do anything, A!

632
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:15,379
And B, shut the fuck up, you don't
know what you're talking about!

633
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,514
Guys, it's Thanksgiving!
You know what?

634
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,484
Take your turkey and shove
it up your ass. I don't give a fuck.

635
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:23,921
Don't you fucking tell me I don't know what
I'm talking about. Not ever, you hear me?

636
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:26,390
I've known all about cops
since I was 12 years old.

637
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,258
As far as I'm concerned, they got
exactly what was coming to them.

638
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,693
What, you think they had a choice?

639
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:32,496
Yeah. That's right, they had a choice.
So did you.

640
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:35,132
Don't try to make us think that
you're the victim all of a sudden.

641
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:36,366
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

642
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,201
Don't put your fucking hands on me!
Please, please!

643
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,105
Please, my God.

644
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,807
What is the matter with you guys?

645
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:46,810
Chris, are you crazy, come on!

646
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:50,447
I mean, we're never together. Now we're
all together we gotta act like animals.

647
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:53,283
Do I gotta beg you guys?
Please, stop making trouble!

648
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:55,252
What, what are you talking about?
Me making trouble?

649
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:56,987
I didn't do shit, Pop!
I didn't mean you.

650
00:50:56,988 --> 00:51:00,487
I'll tell you what... There he goes,
he's got a smile now. I tell you what,

651
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:03,126
I'm out of this nuthouse. If the department
needs me, tell them to call me at home.

652
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:05,062
No! Nobody's leaving.
I been cooking all morning.

653
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,797
I mean, what're you guys,
10 years old?

654
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:09,298
Sit down on the couch,
shut your fucking mouths.

655
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,401
No Dad, I've had it!

656
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,382
Please, have some manners for
once in your life, please!

657
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,473
He's got a fucking
smile on his face.

658
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:17,854
All right, all right.

659
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,983
Okay?
All right.

660
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,489
You little fucking prick!

661
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,157
Yeah, yeah,
go fuck yourself, convict.

662
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:36,818
Oh, come on!
Hey, hey, hey!

663
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,795
(GRUNTING)
(MARIE GASPS)

664
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:41,730
Dad. Dad, you all right?

665
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,203
Oh, my God.

666
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:49,639
No, no, I'm okay. I'm okay.
All right.

667
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,700
You're bleeding.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

668
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,861
(WHEEZING)

669
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,563
Sit the fuck down.

670
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:07,256
You two assholes,
sit the fuck down!

671
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,380
MARIE: Dad, you're all right?

672
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,496
Go fix the turkey.
Okay.

673
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:18,867
Gimme...

674
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,515
There's three of them.

675
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:34,851
The two DeStefano brothers
and Heredy...

676
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:38,255
They got a bar over on
Nassau called Gantry's.

677
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:41,625
A little neighborhood spot
that's always empty.

678
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:45,328
They open it up for lunch but
they're always in there real early.

679
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,930
It's ideal.

680
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:49,431
The address is
on the back of the picture.

681
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,868
I just need to
get back on my feet.

682
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,612
I'm not gonna make a habit of this.
Understood?

683
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,067
Understood.

684
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,729
Any questions?

685

"That's my brother."

He told me he tried to call you

1070

and come to see you
but you didn't want to.

1071

1072

He's getting married soon,
and, I mean...

1073

He's your brother.

Hey... you...
No, no, no, listen to me.

1084
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:21,970
You know, when...
When your mother left,

1085
01:27:21,971 --> 01:27:24,738
you weren't more than
a year and a half.

1086
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,711
I was...

1087
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:32,759
...very resentful.

1088
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,551
You know, about your mother...

1089
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:39,553
Every time I looked
at you, I... I saw her.

1090
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:46,243
And you can't imagine how much...
how much you look like her.

1091
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,063
And she...

1092
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,069
She was beautiful.

know just all wrong,

01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:07,615
it's... I mean... it's... It's wrong and
it's a horrible god-awful thing to say

1095
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,650
but it took me time...

1096
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,056
...not... not to think
of you as a burden.

1097
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:18,960
I mean that doesn't excuse that
I wasn't with you all the time,

1098
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,429
but all that,

1099

1102
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,739
I just want you to know...

1103
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:38,178
I think that you're
a hell of a good man, Frank.

1104

for me to say all the time,

to be a father.
