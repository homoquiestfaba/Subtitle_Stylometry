telling your husband that

190
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,864
he needs some new accounts.

Uh... Frosty Cakes,

193
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,402
and some company that
sells office supplies

194
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,805
- marketed towards women.
- [laughs]

195
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,240
You just need to make a
better impression on Simion.

196
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,818
Oh, that's a really
good idea. Thank you.

197
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,119
- I hadn't thought of that.
- [man laughs]

- What happened?

200
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,652
Nothing, I just made this
silly mistake earlier

201
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:05,920
during a presentation

202
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:08,022
and I'm never gonna
hear the end of it.

203
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:09,757
[man] He was trying
to say to a client

204
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,992
that he'd fight for them,

205
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:12,827
but instead he said
he'd torture them.

if I smoke in here?

208
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,572
Uh, well, Julia gave up
smoking a few months ago.

209
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,674
Really? I don't see
you as a smoker.

210
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,241
I'm trying not to be.

211
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,612
- I... I don't have to.
- No. No, really.

212
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,046
It's totally fine.

213
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,423
[man] I don't want to
be a bad influence.

214
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,382
- No, it... it's fine.
- [man] All right. Thanks.

215
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,150
[woman] Francis told
us you're an actress.

Wasn't really for me,

219
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,628
so I'm, um, reevaluating.

220
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:50,865
Uh, Jules and I had an interesting
experience the other night, didn't we?

221
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,141
We were walking just
a few blocks away,

222
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,134
we go past this crime
scene, a bunch of cops.

223
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,207
This afternoon, we turn on
the news and there it is.

224
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,083
- [woman] What happened?
- [man] They found a woman murdered in her apartment.

225
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:01,809
- Yeah, you heard about it too?

What?

229
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,894
Do I need to leave so
the grownups can talk?

230
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,730
They're saying the woman
had her head cut off.

231
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,884
- You didn't tell me that.
- They didn't say anything about that.

232
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,403
It must be related
to the other attacks.

233
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,406
So, uh, they found a
woman about a month ago

234
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,174
with her throat slit
in her apartment

235
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,510
around the same age.

236
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:38,112
So, but this one,
he cut so deep,

237
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:40,114
it was essentially
a decapitation.

238
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,816
They're calling him The Spider.

I think he regrets
it now but, uh,

489
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:50,418
it just makes it easier for me

you from the theater

across the street to the market?

524
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:19,954
I think so.

I think it could be.

his face in a window

534
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:52,253
Not exactly.

535
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:55,089
It was dark. It was
his silhouette mostly.

- Mostly?
- Look, this isn't normal.

I'll talk with him.

If you want, you
can come with me,

see if it's the same
man as in the picture,

be shopping at the same store.

He lives in the building

Mr. Weber made a
complaint with us today

has been harassing him.

from your complaint,

and I wanted to resolve this
before it goes any further.

this was misunderstanding,

779
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,954
They found a bunch of her

780
01:10:19,987 --> 01:10:21,756
