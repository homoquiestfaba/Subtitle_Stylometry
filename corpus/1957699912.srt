00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:09,217
[crickets chirping]

2
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,362
[car door opens]

3
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:16,098
Kyle!

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,881
Kyle McCormick!

5
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:20,673
-[flashlight clicks]
-[gasps]

6
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:22,337
[man] What are you doing here?

7
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:23,329
I was...

8
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:26,497
Can you put that flashlight
down, please?

9
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:28,674
Thank you.

10
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:30,401
You know,
this is private property.

11
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:32,674
I'm looking for my son, Kyle.

12
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:34,402
[sheriff]
He came here with you?

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,266
No.

14
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:38,657
-Boys from school--
-[sheriff] They dared him.

15
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,986
Lady, you would not believe
how many kids

16
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:44,866
I've had to run off ever since
<i>America's Most Haunted</i> was here.

17
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:47,938
But we've collected
nearly $200,000

18
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,497
in trespassing fines
just from the last year.

19
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:53,506
-My son is not a trespasser.
-[sheriff] Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,032
-How old is he?
-Fifteen.

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,226
Uh, he's probably out
just joyriding with his friends.

22
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:02,146
They're probably
mooning some takeout window

23
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:04,098
at the local
burger joint by now.

24
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,849
Why don't you go home?
He'll turn up.

25
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,705
They don't always, do they?

26
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:10,914
-[sheriff] What do you mean?
-You know what I mean.

27
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:14,722
[sighs] Kids, teenagers,
they run away from home.

28
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:16,706
Boys, especially.

29
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:20,032
Heck, they were doing that
ever since I was in high school.

30
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:22,530
But more of them disappear
after coming here, don't they?

31
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:25,729
Well, we don't keep records
on that sort of thing.

32
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:27,777
Sheriff, please. Look around.

33
00:01:29,058 --> 00:01:31,552
I don't have to see it
on TV to know...

34
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:34,465
there's something wrong
about this place.

35
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,417
That place?

36
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:40,096
People got hurt here,
people died here.

37
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:43,201
You don't believe
what people say about...

38
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,961
the ghosts of the dead.

39
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,554
I don't believe in ghosts,
I don't believe in poltergeists,

40
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:49,282
I don't believe
in shadow people.

41
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:50,625
What do you believe in?

42
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,986
I believe in evil.

43
00:01:55,842 --> 00:01:57,058
And Pennhurst is evil.

44
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,393
All right. Look.
I'll look for him.

45
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:04,482
What's he wearing?

46
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:07,554
His red letterman's jacket.

47
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:11,138
He was so proud to get his
letter in JV track.

48
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:14,242
-[sheriff] Red letterman jacket?
-With white sleeves.

49
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:16,034
Okay. Got it.
With white sleeves.

50
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,713
Why don't you go on home?
I'll look for him.

51
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,593
All right.
Thank you.

52
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:31,458
[car engine starts]

53
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:42,914
[sheriff] Son of a bitch.

54
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:44,449
Kyle!

55
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,392
Kyle! Kyle!

56
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:49,825
Let's go, son.

57
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,146
Kyle, your mom's
worried about you.

58
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:03,616
She wants you to come home.

59
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,874
All right, son,
you're trespassing.

60
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:11,746
[crying]

61
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,433
I hear you, son.

62
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:18,466
Kyle. All right.
Stop crying, son.

63
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,936
I'm not gonna do it.

64
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:21,474
No! [screams]

65
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,136
[indistinct chatter]

66
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:43,458
[Vincent]
Guys, it's not much further.

67
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,538
[Jake] You said it was,
like, two minutes.

68
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,865
[Vincent] We walk this fucking
many steps every day at school.

69
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,081
All right, guys,
we're almost there.

70
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,362
-[Amelia] Are you taking us--
-[Jenny] Oh, yeah, really?

71
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,378
You're alive, guys!
[claps]

72
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,458
Wouldn't offer you up
for sacrifice if you were dead,

73
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,249
so I'm gonna make sure
you get there alive.

74
00:04:13,282 --> 00:04:14,817
Fucking kill you
if we don't make it, dude.

75
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,906
Really, save us.

76
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:17,026
[Jenny]
I don't trust you to protect me.

77
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:17,858
-Yeah, really?
-[Jasmine laughs]

78
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,778
[Cody]
Tour guide, Vincent, thank you.

79
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,376
-[sighs]
-[Jenny] Will you wait up?

80
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,074
What's the fucking rush?

81
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:24,994
Wouldn't wanna miss
the haunted insane alyssum.

82
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,426
You don't believe me?
This shit's the real deal,

83
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,346
they're filming, uh,
some TV show here.

84
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:30,754
[Jenny] <i>Haunted America?</i>

85
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:32,226
<i>Ghost Finders,</i>
the one on the Syfy Channel.

86
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:34,434
And that's cool because...

87
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:35,936
[Vincent]
That's not the point, Jen.

88
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,978
The point is,
this is Pennhurst.

89
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,665
Eighty acres of...

90
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:45,376
fucked-up haunted
mental institution.

91
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,762
[speaking indistinctly]

92
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:52,482
[Chris] Sorry, Dad, but...

93
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:54,242
[Chris' dad]
Chris, they'll take you.

94
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,514
Don't let them take me, Dad.
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,434
It's time, Chris.

96
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:01,282
Don't let them take me.
Don't let them take me.

97
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,946
Dad! Dad!

98
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:04,705
Don't touch me!

99
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:08,833
Don't touch me!
Dad! Dad! Dad!

100
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:11,778
-[Chris screaming]
-[engine starts]

101
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,769
Looks like a tough one.

102
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,258
Give him a sedative.
Don't worry, we'll break him.

103
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,312
Seriously?
Why the hell are we here?

104
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:39,522
They're turning this place
into a theme park or something.

105
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,602
-Haunted theme park?
-Yeah, whatever.

106
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,170
Look, the point is,
that after this,

107
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,346
it's gonna be impossible for us
to sneak in here.

108
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:48,993
-So let's go?
-Let's do it.

109
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,146
-Let's go?
-Let's go.

110
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:09,122
-Haunted theme park.
-[all] Ooh.

111
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:11,554
[Jake] This guy is busy at work,
right here.

112
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,122
I don't know what the hell
he's doing.

113
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,305
Working himself to the bone.

114
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:17,185
-[laughs]
-[Cody] Ooh, Jake!

115
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:19,456
-[Vincent] Oh, showers.
-Showers, there you go.

116
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:20,706
Haunted day spa.

117
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:22,657
-There you go, Jasmine.
-[Jasmine] Shut up.

118
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,506
[overlapping conversation]

119
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:28,096
And, of course, the food court.

120
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:29,698
[Jake] Oh, there we go.

121
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,393
If you care
for some late refreshments.

122
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:32,993
[Amelia]
Fine dining up in here.

123
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,897
Your choice of white food,
grey food, or orange food.

124
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,017
[overlapping conversation]

125
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:40,866
[Jake] Hi, Grandpa,
how are you doing?

126
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:42,529
Yes, so this is my grandpa.

127
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:44,194
[Jake screams]

128
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:47,041
[screaming]

129
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:53,090
[boys laughing]

130
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,498
[Jake] That's great,
they're scared.

131
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,186
-Seriously?
-That's not funny.

132
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,177
Fuck you, Jake!

133
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:00,866
Ooh!

134
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,138
-[Jenny] Why did you that?
-[Cody] Stop it.

135
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:04,706
Good shit, man.

136
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:06,946
-Awesome. So good.
-[Jasmine] Stop.

137
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,962
-That's really not funny.
-[Jake] Ow!

138
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,153
Look at this stuff.

139
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,953
[Amelia]
Harrowing conditions.

140
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:48,385
I can't understand why
they needed hospitals like this.

141
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,673
[Jenny] People didn't understand
mental illness back then,

142
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,978
just because they thought
it was all about Satan

143
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,025
and demonic possession
and shit like that.

144
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:58,882
[Amelia] So, they were
gonna torture them straight?

145
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:00,961
-[Jake] Whoa!
-What is it?

146
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:04,130
[Jake]
Now, 1683 they were still...

147
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,281
[Amelia] Bullshit!

148
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:07,010
[Vincent] I mean, the state
kinda wanted to be exclusive

149
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,090
on freaky puritan behavior.

150
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,186
The governor, William Penn,
actually sat on a trial

151
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,690
as one of the judges.

152
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:17,730
Now, these two Swedish immigrant
women were--

153
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:18,978
That's ancient history,

154
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:20,993
why do you even wanna know
shit like that?

155
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,657
[Jake]
Vincent's going to college.

156
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,281
Not community college,
but real-life four-year college.

157
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:26,306
I'm impressed.

158
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:28,449
-Really?
-No.

159
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:29,602
College is a waste of money.

160
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:32,513
[spray paint cans rattling]

161
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,242
[spray paint hissing]

162
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,018
Vincent, you
spelled "fuck" wrong.

163
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,473
I meant to do that.

164
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:46,722
Does this get any better?

165
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:48,034
Yeah, when the ghosts come out.

166
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:50,593
This is lame,
it's just an empty building.

167
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:53,346
No way. You don't know
what happened here?

168
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:54,337
What?

169
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:58,050
A whole TV show film crew
disappeared here last year.

170
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,329
I never heard that.

171
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:01,217
Well, no one did,
but it's true.

172
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:04,225
My dad has a friend
in the police force.

173
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:05,826
Who were they?

174
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:07,553
They were from that show
with the psychic chick,

175
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:10,018
-the one on channel nine.
-[Jasmine] I love that channel.

176
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,706
Um, they have that show
with the guy who eats bugs

177
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:15,553
in foreign countries,
but I never understood

178
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:18,402
why they had
ghost shows on there.

179
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,674
Yeah. That's not the point.

180
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:22,817
The point is they came here
to shoot a segment...

181
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,321
and they were never
heard from again. [chuckles]

182
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:40,577
Hey, listen, if we don't get
these shots and nail this,

183
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:42,754
somebody's gonna
have my balls, okay?

184
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:44,897
I'm not going down alone,
I'll tell you that.

185
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,761
Oh, man,

186
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,394
this is real <i>Deliverance</i>
territory, right here.

187
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,833
Oh, good,
you'll fit right in, then.

188
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,082
[humming "Dueling Banjos"]

189
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:56,545
Any chance Matilda loves us
enough to spring

190
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:58,593
-for a decent meal for a change?
-[Badger] Ya got a pretty mouth.

191
00:09:58,626 --> 00:09:59,938
-Yeah, right.
-[Jesse laughs]

192
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,729
She wants you hungry.
Makes you work harder.

193
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:04,290
Uh-huh. Making you hungry
makes you faint.

194
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,281
Yeah, that's such crap.

195
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:23,521
But how could Bruce Willis
not have known he was a ghost?

196
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:25,377
-I mean...
-He was dead.

197
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,170
You're not thinking
straight when you're dead.

198
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,313
And didn't he think it was weird
that he didn't have to pee?

199
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:31,297
Well, he didn't drink anything
after his death,

200
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,513
so maybe he figured out
that was why.

201
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:35,873
What about sleeping? Didn't
he notice he never got tired?

202
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:37,089
-Oh, yeah, good point.
-[Jesse] Yeah.

203
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:37,953
[loud rattling]

204
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:39,585
-What was that?
-What happened?

205
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,113
Holy shit,
did I just hit something?

206
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:43,746
No, you didn't.

207
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,345
-The fuck was that?
-Did not sound good.

208
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,762
[indistinct chatter]

209
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:12,353
You want me to throw it
in the back?

210
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,889
-How are you?
-[Scott] Hello?

211
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:23,937
I'm standing in front
of the abandoned

212
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,697
state mental hospital
known as Pennhurst.

213
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:27,777
-And let me tell you...
-[Scott] I can't hear you.

214
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,633
...as you can see,
it is eerie.

215
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:32,353
I know. I know. I know.

216
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:38,913
Pennhurst served as the clearing
house of the mentally ill

217
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:41,825
and unfortunately
the hunting grounds

218
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:43,873
of the abusive attendants.

219
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:46,114
And now,
according to local legend,

220
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,034
these grounds
are riddled with the ghosts

221
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,505
of the violent past.

222
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,290
-Damn! I'm good. All right.
-[Badger] Yeah. It was good.

223
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,441
All right, three...

224
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,505
[indistinct chatter]

225
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:05,665
[Megan]
Donuts? Bags? Anyone?

226
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:11,938
The ghosts
have a truly violent past.

227
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:15,746
Motherfucker!

228
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,633
-[Badger] Wow, yeah.
-Okay. Just keep it going.

229
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,521
[Badger] Do you think
you nailed that?

230
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:21,153
-Shh. In three, two, one.
-[Badger] Yup.

231
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:22,945
So, I'm gonna try to get
a reading now

232
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:25,121
-and see if I can feel anything.
-[Badger] Oh, my God.

233
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:28,066
[snoring]

234
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:32,513
-Nothing.
-[Badger] Really?

235
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,921
I'm not picking up any...

236
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:37,793
Badger, please don't talk.
Damn it, man. Come on!

237
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:41,057
That was--
You're blowing take after take

238
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,233
and I did the trance
and everything. Scott!

239
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:44,417
[Badger] You think
you did the trance?

240
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,273
Shut up!
Scott, can I talk to you?

241
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,274
[indistinct chatter]

242
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,585
-[Megan] Donuts?
-Do you need help?

243
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,921
Oh!

244
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:00,481
You're the caretaker?

245
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:01,569
I'm Willard.

246
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,129
We're supposed to check in
with you when we got here.

247
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:07,297
-We're here.
-Okay.

248
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,201
You live around here?

249
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,729
I used to.

250
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,937
Uh, do you-- Do you
know Pennhurst pretty well?

251
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,465
Yes.

252
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,937
You think
you could show us around?

253
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,753
It would be better if you left.

254
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:25,922
Scott, I thought
this was all arranged,

255
00:14:25,954 --> 00:14:26,882
this was all cleared.

256
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,602
[Scott] What's going on,
who's this?

257
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,225
[Willard]
It would be better if you left.

258
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,602
Are you saying we have to leave?

259
00:14:35,362 --> 00:14:36,418
It's up to you.

260
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:40,226
All right.
Let's do a walkthrough, guys.

261
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:42,497
-When I'm talking, don't talk.
-[indistinct chatter]

262
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,994
-[Sarah] Guys, come on!
-Huh?

263
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:46,786
-[Sarah] Let's do a walkthrough.
-[both] Oh, okay.

264
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:48,449
Scott, I wish
you would not tell him.

265
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,297
-I wish you would not tell him.
-Cameras, enough.

266
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,570
Then Matilda's considering
letting do stuff--

267
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,073
[Scott] Yeah. Just no.

268
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:57,442
-Because all he does is...
-You are doing great.

269
00:14:57,474 --> 00:14:59,330
-You are doing great.
-I know I'm doing great.

270
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,025
[indistinct chatter]

271
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:10,433
[inaudible]

272
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,809
Where the hell is Elden?

273
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:49,889
He thinks the bathroom
still works, I don't know.

274
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:51,266
[Jesse] Pennhurst State School
and Hospital

275
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:55,106
sits on 115 acres of land.

276
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:56,898
It's composed of 17
different buildings,

277
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,850
all of which are connected
through a series

278
00:15:58,882 --> 00:15:59,713
of underground tunnels.

279
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:01,249
Oh, awesome.
Where are those?

280
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:02,272
I'm not sure.

281
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:06,305
The building we're in now
was referred to as Building A.

282
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:08,865
This must've been the day room.

283
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:12,065
We're in what was known as Q1,
back when it was in use.

284
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,953
Marginally retarded
low-maintenance patients

285
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:15,234
spent their days in here.

286
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,665
Ah. You must feel right
at home there, Badger.

287
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:20,673
No, she said Q1
was for marginally retarded.

288
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,050
I don't think Badger
would've made the cut.

289
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,681
[laughs]

290
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:24,834
[laughs] Okay, next.

291
00:16:25,473 --> 00:16:27,169
You guys are hilarious,
you know.

292
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,602
[indistinct chatter]

293
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:34,466
Pennhurst had a staff
of doctors

294
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,322
including surgeons and dentists.

295
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:37,985
[Sarah] Watch your step.

296
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:40,226
So this is maybe some sort
of operating room or--

297
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:41,954
They were at the forefront
of cutting-edge

298
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,898
medical treatments
like sterilization or...

299
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:48,289
pulling the teeth
of patients who might bite.

300
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,858
-[Badger] Ooh.
-[Sarah] That's nasty.

301
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,778
I think one of you girls
should show your boobs,

302
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,185
maybe we'll see
some ghosts down here.

303
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:55,265
-[Megan] You know what--
-[Jesse] All right!

304
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:58,306
-[Jesse] Moving along.
-[Megan] Disgusting!

305
00:16:58,498 --> 00:17:00,354
-[Elden] What did I miss?
-Nothing, at all.

306
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,378
[Elden] Okay.

307
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:09,794
[Sarah] Where's Megan?
Megan!

308
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:10,754
Coming.

309
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,345
[indistinct chatter]

310
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:18,626
[Badger] What is this?

311
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,193
[Scott]
It's popular with the rats.

312
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,762
Oh, look at this.

313
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:24,737
-[Badger] It this remodeled?
-[Jesse] This is the cafeteria.

314
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,242
[Elden] Okay. Yum.

315
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:29,986
Everyone ate as a group,
patients, attendants, doctors.

316
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:31,938
Doesn't look so bad.

317
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,914
I mean, lots of room,
plenty of light.

318
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,634
Just wait.

319
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,225
Okay. Let's get out of here.

320
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:41,506
[Elden] Wait, let's see
what's on the menu.

321
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,594
[Scott]
Yeah, if they're serving chili,

322
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,641
-I'll definitely stay.
-Follow me, watch your steps.

323
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:46,242
[indistinct chatter]

324
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,194
[Scott] I had a house
on the Jersey Shore like this.

325
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:49,665
[Elden laughs]

326
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,321
Any guesses on what this is?

327
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:55,842
Oh, the attitude
readjustment room?

328
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,345
[Jesse] Sort of.

329
00:17:57,954 --> 00:18:00,706
It's actually
the electroshock therapy room.

330
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:01,505
Ooh, kinky.

331
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,818
At the time
they started using it,

332
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,578
it was considered
cutting edge therapy.

333
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,041
[indistinct chatter]

334
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:08,674
[Scott] Look at this.
I got to get me one of these.

335
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:09,505
It's beautiful, yeah.

336
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:10,912
[Scott] Huh?

337
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:14,913
-[Elden] Whoa!
-Dude, dude!

338
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:16,098
-[Elden] Whoa!
-Okay! Really?

339
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,617
-[chuckles] Sorry, I had to.
-Oh, I like that. Nice try.

340
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:20,962
-I tried.
-All right.

341
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,585
Okay. Next room.

342
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,505
Watch your football game in
here, you don't have to move.

343
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,594
[chuckles]

344
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:30,145
[Jesse]
This is one of the dorms.

345
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,330
[Sarah] So they kept them
all in the same rooms?

346
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:37,186
[Jesse] Not everyone, but some.

347
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,418
They had to.

348
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,234
The facility was designed
to accommodate 800 patients.

349
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:46,945
At its peak, it held 2,500
and they never had enough staff.

350
00:18:46,978 --> 00:18:48,674
So, they grouped
a lot of them together.

351
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:50,785
What is that?

352
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:55,072
That must be the crib.
I saw it on a documentary.

353
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:57,186
Some of the patients
were essentially

354
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,041
babies in adult bodies,

355
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,729
so they put them
in a giant crib.

356
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,841
Oh, man, it looks like
they kept them there.

357
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:07,138
Many patients spent their entire
lives at Pennhurst.

358
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,409
From childhood
until they died of old age.

359
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:12,256
That's a lot of Depend.

360
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:12,961
Right.

361
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:15,745
-[groans]
-Thanks a lot.

362
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:17,634
I think they should
be called Definitely.

363
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,266
Oh, yeah!
Definitely, that's good.

364
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:21,601
-Yeah.
-And why do you have a coupon?

365
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:23,905
If you're shitting yourself,
who cares about the $3?

366
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:26,785
You got to pay $1,100 apiece
if you have to.

367
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,866
[Jesse] Pay close attention
to this one, Elden.

368
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:31,201
Because this is where
they would end up.

369
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:32,994
-[Badger] Picking anything up?
-[Elden] Not a thing!

370
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:33,954
[Badger] Nothing, man?

371
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,938
-I'm shocked. Yeah.
-The morgue!

372
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:39,649
Yup! I believe they also did
autopsies in here, too.

373
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,282
-[Badger] Oh, yeah.
-Look at this.

374
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,754
Oh, this is great.

375
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,865
-Don't touch that!
-I'm just getting a reading.

376
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:47,521
[Jesse] Take a peek in here.

377
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:50,752
Yeah. We can get a camera
in there, right?

378
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:52,066
[Sarah] Yeah, sure.

379
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:54,274
Nice, though.
One-stop retard shopping.

380
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:56,002
Oh, Badger, you might not wanna
let them hear you say that,

381
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,954
because you could end up in here
at some point.

382
00:19:58,432 --> 00:19:59,842
-[metal door slams]
-Whoa!

383
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:01,858
-Shit!
-[Jesse laughs]

384
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,096
Sorry. Come on, guys!
Next room.

385
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:05,634
[Scott] What the hell's
the matter with you?

386
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:06,594
-Crazy.
-Right?

387
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:10,082
[Jesse] This is Building B,

388
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:12,962
where the more severely
handicapped were kept.

389
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,066
[Sarah] What's more
severely handicapped?

390
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:17,954
-[Badger] Vegetables!
-[Jesse] Essentially. Invalids.

391
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:19,138
People who just
couldn't function

392
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,962
on the most basic level
in society.

393
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:32,193
So, they just
warehouse them in here.

394
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:33,856
Yup. I mean,
what are you gonna do?

395
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:35,970
-You have to live somewhere.
-You left out some parts.

396
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,218
Jesus, Willard!

397
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:39,074
Shit!

398
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:43,906
Shit!

399
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:45,602
Pennhurst started out
as a good idea,

400
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,898
yet quickly spiraled downward
into a nightmare of...

401
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,714
Of intimidation.

402
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,538
There's beatings, rapes,
and castrations...

403
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,073
and experimental psychotropics,

404
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,074
and medicinal
and psychological abuse.

405
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:10,466
And if you weren't useful
to them as--

406
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:13,825
As slave labor to help
make the clothes

407
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:16,546
they sold at a profit
to the local businessmen,

408
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:19,426
well, then there was always
medical experimentation...

409
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,634
and lobotomies.

410
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:24,033
Hey! Who the hell
are you, anyway?

411
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:25,026
He's the caretaker.

412
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:26,913
Willard, thank you
for the history lesson here,

413
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:28,258
but we're trying to work.

414
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,953
Do you need
something specific

415
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,552
or are you just gonna
keep freaking us out?

416
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:32,769
-[sensor clicking]
-[Badger] Whoa! Whoa!

417
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:34,818
Holy shit! Look at this, guys!

418
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:36,865
-Yes! I got something!
-What you got over there?

419
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:39,841
Hold on a sec, let me see
if I can get a reading.

420
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:41,665
-[sensor clicking rapidly]
-No, <i>nada.</i> Yeah.

421
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:43,489
You must've damaged
the equipment, Badger.

422
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:44,449
-[Badger] No, no, no.
-There's nothing here.

423
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,561
I'm serious. You must've
dropped it or something.

424
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:48,193
-We're wasting our time.
-Wait. Shh, you guys.

425
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:51,138
-[Elden] What?
-[children giggling]

426
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:53,154
Did you hear that?

427
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:55,873
[loud banging]

428
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:57,762
What the fuck was that?

429
00:21:57,793 --> 00:21:58,914
[Scott]
Anybody got a video camera?

430
00:21:58,945 --> 00:21:59,905
[indistinct shouting]

431
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:02,402
Guys! Guys, get over here,
you got to see this!

432
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:04,705
Look at this.

433
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:09,282
Right behind that wall.
There's a shape.

434
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:10,434
You see that?

435
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:15,906
[indistinct chatter]

436
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,018
[Badger] That was amazing!

437
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,777
[Sarah] Oh, my goodness!
-[Jesse] Really?

438
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,417
Okay. So, do we always
find ghosts that fast?

439
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,858
-Never. Never during the day.
-[Megan] No.

440
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,874
Okay. Jesse and I
are gonna take building B.

441
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:29,634
Sarah, Badger, Elden,
you guys are Building A.

442
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,297
-All right. What's our coverage?
-[Megan] Full.

443
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:34,017
Wireless cams, EVPs,
thermals, EMFs,

444
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,329
motion-activated still cams.

445
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:37,153
I really want
this place covered.

446
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:39,073
Everything will feed back
into the production van,

447
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:40,609
and Scott
will be on the monitors

448
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:42,082
and acting as quarterback
on this one.

449
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:45,376
I think we really
have a shot here, guys.

450
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,586
-Don't fuck this up.
-Oh, thanks for the confidence.

451
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,473
I'm serious, Badger.

452
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:52,738
I think this is the real deal,
which means real ghosts.

453
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,721
So, you know the drill.

454
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:56,001
Don't challenge them,
don't aggravate them,

455
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:57,153
show them respect.

456
00:22:57,186 --> 00:22:58,881
We're here as researchers.

457
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,314
Actually we're here as
researchers with shitty ratings.

458
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:03,234
So, let's stir up the pot
a little bit?

459
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:05,058
Did you not see
what I saw in there?

460
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,105
I don't think
we have to stir this pot at all.

461
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:08,610
It's not too late to leave.

462
00:23:08,642 --> 00:23:10,786
Willard, if you're
gonna call the cops, do it.

463
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:12,386
If not,
please get out of our way.

464
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,473
I'm trying to help.

465
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:15,778
Are we ready?
Charged up, extra batteries?

466
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:17,506
-[all] Ready.
-[Badger] Charged.

467
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:19,329
-Let's go.
-[Jesse] Okay.

468
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:21,825
[indistinct chatter]

469
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,122
[Sarah] Elden, come on!

470
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,338
-[Elden] Over there?
-[Sarah] Yes.

471
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:31,938
Wait, so you're saying that

472
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,473
they went hunting for ghosts
during the day?

473
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:34,722
[tuts] What a rip!

474
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,473
Well, I mean,
it's not like the paranormal

475
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:39,137
really has, like,
a biological clock.

476
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:41,506
They're up 24/7.

477
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,033
What's that for?

478
00:23:44,545 --> 00:23:46,561
Oh, that's
to bring the ghosts out.

479
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:48,514
Why did they have flashlights
during the daytime?

480
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:50,401
What are you asking me for?
[stammers]

481
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:53,122
I didn't make this shit up.
Like, this shit happened.

482
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,746
Wait. So, when
do the ghosts come out?

483
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:57,154
I mean, this isn't gonna be
like your last story,

484
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,978
I don't think I can handle
five more minutes

485
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,506
of them walking around
with nothing happening.

486
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:03,457
-I mean, does--
-You want some scary shit?

487
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,193
-How about this?
-[screams]

488
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:10,338
-Hey!
-What the fuck was that for?

489
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,193
[Amelia] You were
trying to grab my boob!

490
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:14,657
-I was just joking, bitch.
-Perv.

491
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,218
-[Jake] Cockblock!
-Guys! Just chill out, please.

492
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:21,025
All right, this is supposed
to be scary. It's haunted.

493
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,074
[chuckles] Now,
can I finish the F-ing story?

494
00:24:23,105 --> 00:24:24,802
All right. So they were...

495
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,618
Girls were running out in terror
from the haunted house, right?

496
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:30,433
Well, I mean, they went
to go get their equipment.

497
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:32,066
Wait, so they're professional
ghost hunters

498
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,986
who leave their shit in the van
instead of bringing them

499
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:35,073
to the haunted house.

500
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,890
Look, Cody, I don't need
this shit from you right now.

501
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:39,810
Like, if you're not
interested in the story,

502
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:43,586
we could call your mom
and she could come pick you up.

503
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:45,666
-[chuckling]
-No.

504
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:50,337
That's when shit started to get
freaky with a capital freak.

505
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:06,113
[Elden] Whoa!

506
00:25:06,977 --> 00:25:08,129
Yeah.

507
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:10,945
You know what, if you guys
don't need me for anything--

508
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:13,377
Um, actually,
you could hang a camera, too.

509
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,682
[laughs] Yeah. You know what,
I think I'm gonna try to get

510
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:18,146
some readings in other rooms
of this building, you know.

511
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:19,393
-[Badger] Mm-hmm.
-Play to my strengths.

512
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:20,578
Yeah.

513
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:22,817
[sighs]

514
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:25,153
He has strengths?

515
00:25:25,186 --> 00:25:26,850
[Elden]
I heard that, cheeky monkey!

516
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:29,218
-No. No, he doesn't.
-[Sarah laughs] Okay.

517
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:32,098
Okay. So, uh,
what I'm thinking here

518
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:34,018
is that we get
some wider lenses

519
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,642
to cover the whole area
and then we can, uh...

520
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:40,065
get some softer lenses
to cover the doors.

521
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,714
Um, you know, because,
I mean, it would be really cool

522
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:47,554
if we can, uh, get those, uh,
rooms-- The doors closing.

523
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:50,242
Um, yeah, I think if we get
the doors closing again,

524
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:51,265
-it's gonna be really cool.
-Okay.

525
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:54,690
-And what about the hallways?
-What about them?

526
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,098
Well, I was just thinking

527
00:25:56,129 --> 00:25:57,762
we should put a camera
in the hallways, right?

528
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:59,746
That's where
the ghost came from in Q1.

529
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:01,666
Just to make sure
we cover all our bases.

530
00:26:01,697 --> 00:26:04,577
Yeah. You're cute. Okay.

531
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:07,041
So, look, newbie,
um, trust me on this.

532
00:26:07,073 --> 00:26:09,538
And once you've had a few years
in the business like I have,

533
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,073
you'll learn a few things.

534
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:14,242
Yeah, um,
we gotta cover this room.

535
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,962
So, why don't we just do it
my way?

536
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:21,410
Hey, Badger.
I don't need a few years

537
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,786
to know that
you're full of shit.

538
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:26,818
So, um, why don't you just cover
this room any way you want?

539
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:30,177
All right. Yeah, great.
Sounds good.

540
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:32,641
Then I'll just find
another room to cover.

541
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:35,810
Oh, um, well, hang on, wait.

542
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:38,242
I mean, I thought-- I thought
we could work together, though.

543
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:40,193
You know, I mean,
you're new and all.

544
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,977
I mean, I could teach you
a few things of the experience.

545
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:46,786
Not a fucking chance.

546
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,785
Okay. All right. I'll see you.

547
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,673
[scoffs] What an asshole!

548
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:55,522
[Elden laughs]

549
00:26:57,313 --> 00:26:59,458
Nice work, Sarah.
It was great.

550
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:02,273
Hmm. That went well.

551
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,913
[drill whirring]

552
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:31,457
[static]

553
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,641
All right, check it.

554
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:38,722
I set up my device to monitor
EMF readings.

555
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:41,217
Cross-reference them with EVP
and thermal data in real time

556
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,041
to eliminate false positives.

557
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:45,377
I figure if we can triangulate
even the lowest level readings

558
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:46,977
with corroborative data
then we can

559
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,353
detect more in our data set.

560
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:50,273
Can you speak English, please?

561
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,609
-This thing F-ing rocks.
-[Megan chuckles]

562
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:55,234
-That works.
-[Jesse] Yes.

563
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:58,433
Okay. Let's set up IRs in here
and the hallways.

564
00:27:58,465 --> 00:28:00,417
-Yeah, that makes sense.
-Let me just go...

565
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,882
[children laughing]

566
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:07,233
Did you hear that?

567
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,193
Yup.

568
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:10,433
[adults laughing]

569
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:11,970
Oh!

570
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,474
That's coming
from the east hall.

571
00:28:13,506 --> 00:28:14,402
Let's go.

572
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,842
[ghostly voice]
<i>Help me!</i>

573
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:30,337
I'm not getting anything.

574
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,409
[disembodied screaming]

575
00:28:33,442 --> 00:28:34,402
Let's go.

576
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:41,218
Hello!

577
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,265
We mean you no harm!

578
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,937
Troubled souls?

579
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:01,345
Is anyone listening?

580
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:03,937
No?

581
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,705
Good.
Because you are so...

582
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,706
boring.

583
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:20,417
[exhales]

584
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,825
Well, I'm definitely
feeling something now.

585
00:29:35,713 --> 00:29:39,137
-What now?
-[disembodied screaming]

586
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:40,353
Through that door.

587
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:46,113
[gasps] Oh, my God.

588
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:47,554
What?

589
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,993
Are you seeing this?

590
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,194
[gasps] It's amazing.

591
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:58,561
Holy shit!

592
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,729
What was that?

593
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:04,065
Sometimes ghosts
just wanna be acknowledged.

594
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:07,426
Willard, have you ever seen
anything like this?

595
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,417
Yes.

596
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:11,745
So, tell me this,

597
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:16,577
if you were a ghost,
where would you be?

598
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:18,657
I'll show you.

599
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:25,249
[music playing on computer]

600
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,369
[beeps]

601
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:27,617
Oh, fuck!

602
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:31,265
Oh, man, I didn't even
hear this thing ring!

603
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:42,657
Oh, man.

604
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:03,617
Oh, shit!

605
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:06,274
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

606
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:09,377
I'm just trying to clear my head
before we tape my segment, okay?

607
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:12,737
Sorry if, you know, I--
I just scared you.

608
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,625
Okay, dude.
Let me get out of your way.

609
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:16,738
Is this your room or something?
Do you mind?

610
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,977
Hey, man! Hey, let's not
fuck round, all right?

611
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,602
Megan! Hey!
Hey, what the-- Hey!

612
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,234
[screams] Don't fuck with me!

613
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,065
Fuck!

614
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:39,746
Wow. What's this?

615
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:42,498
This is Q2.

616
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,282
This is where
you were sent for punishment.

617
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:54,913
Most of the patients
in this ward had a very low IQ.

618
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:58,561
But if you had normal IQ
and you were sent here,

619
00:31:59,713 --> 00:32:01,633
it's because
you were considered difficult.

620
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,506
Being sent to Q2 is far worse

621
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:07,618
than being sent
to solitary confinement.

622
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:11,105
You're immersed
in a sea of people

623
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,025
you couldn't communicate with.

624
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:14,945
That sounds terrible.

625
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:19,042
Alone, in a crowd,
with no escape.

626
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,026
It was torture.

627
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,209
This is where
you'll find your ghosts.

628
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:29,602
So, do spirits just pop up
around here all the time?

629
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:31,681
It happens.

630
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:35,169
[Megan] Has anyone ever
capture them on video before?

631
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:37,057
The spirit doesn't
wanna be seen.

632
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:39,585
It won't let itself be seen.

633
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:41,569
Why? Why would they
wanna be seen?

634
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:44,545
They're sending you a message.

635
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:50,433
So, in your experience,
are the spirits ever dangerous?

636
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:52,578
It depends on the message.

637
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,233
What are they trying to tell us?

638
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:58,912
I've been telling you. Leave.

639
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,994
Scared yet?

640
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:08,002
No. This is bullshit.

641
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:10,786
Corpses that move.

642
00:33:10,818 --> 00:33:12,866
Is this a ghost story
or <i>Walking Dead?</i> I mean...

643
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,457
ghosts that look like zombies?

644
00:33:15,488 --> 00:33:17,698
Not just ghosts, Dr. Death.

645
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:19,490
Who's that?

646
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:22,338
I've heard he was the vengeful
spirit of an old Nazi

647
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,418
who used to torture
his patients to death.

648
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,082
Well, I've heard that
he's actually

649
00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:27,969
an escaped mental patient

650
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:29,954
who's been living here
since '85,

651
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:34,369
eating pigeons,
and sometimes even people.

652
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:35,842
Well, you're both wrong.

653
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:38,305
Dr. Death's been around for

654
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:40,257
longer than anyone
could remember.

655
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:43,201
You know, they say
he haunts these corridors,

656
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:47,298
stirred by the blood
of the living.

657
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:55,874
Oh, awesome!

658
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:57,922
Hey, kid! Kid!
[pounding on window]

659
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:00,898
Kid! Have you seen my friends?

660
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:04,385
Kid! Kid!
Have you seen a white van?

661
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:08,032
Kid!

662
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:10,017
Kid!
[groans]

663
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:14,656
[muffled scream]

664
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,017
One guy and girl,
kind of like you two,

665
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,314
actually came up here one night

666
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,298
and didn't tell anyone
where they were going.

667
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:42,496
And they never made it out.

668
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:45,025
So, what did you hear from them?
Nobody knew where they went?

669
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:48,578
When they looked at the bodies,
carved into the skin...

670
00:34:49,602 --> 00:34:53,442
was "Dr. Death was here."

671
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:59,138
If that happened, then why
didn't we see it on the news?

672
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:01,441
Jasmine, do you watch the news?

673
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,170
MTV News.

674
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,162
That's why.

675
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:06,753
Why didn't they just call
the cops on their cell phones?

676
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:08,034
Look at your cell phone
right now.

677
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:16,353
-No bars.
-Exactly.

678
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:19,169
There's no service for at least
a mile around here.

679
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,049
I think there's some payphones
somewhere, though.

680
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:23,937
If things really
were that freaky,

681
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:26,752
why didn't they just leave and
come back with police officers?

682
00:35:26,785 --> 00:35:28,258
And the police would have
believed them?

683
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:30,946
They never believe
that supernatural shit.

684
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:32,898
Yeah. In the movies.

685
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,746
Well, this isn't a movie.

686
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:38,754
And the cops wouldn't have
gotten there in time anyway.

687
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:41,569
Besides, what makes you think

00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:18,978
[panting]

867
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:21,376
[Dr. Death] How do you feel?

868
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,714
-You feel better, huh?
-Fuck you.

869
00:52:23,746 --> 00:52:24,802
You ready to play by the rules?

870
00:52:24,834 --> 00:52:28,609
-[whimpering]
-No? Aw.

871
00:52:28,642 --> 00:52:31,681
-[mumbling]
-Huh?

872
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:34,498
[mumbling, crying]

873
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,338
Oh! That's a real shame.
I had high hopes for you.

874
00:52:39,745 --> 00:52:41,986
Please stop,
please stop, please stop.

875
00:52:42,882 --> 00:52:44,065
[Elden crying]

876
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:46,658
[electric crackling]

877
00:52:46,882 --> 00:52:47,874
[grunting]

878
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,762
[screaming]

879
00:53:06,946 --> 00:53:08,673
[machine powering off]

880
00:53:14,306 --> 00:53:15,266
Hmm.

881
00:53:17,825 --> 00:53:21,378
Well, we try our best.

882
00:53:33,506 --> 00:53:35,553
Can one of you guys
please answer your walkies?

883
00:53:37,346 --> 00:53:38,754
This is Badger's?

884
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:42,433
Hmm, yes, it is.
And it's still rolling.

885
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,386
He's gotta be close.
Badger?

886
00:54:08,386 --> 00:54:10,338
[Dr. Death]
Good morning, sunshine.

887
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:13,153
What the fuck is going on?

888
00:54:16,258 --> 00:54:17,826
What the fuck
do you want with me?

889
00:54:17,857 --> 00:54:18,946
Let me out of here, man.

890
00:54:19,234 --> 00:54:21,762
[Dr. Death] Now,
that's not the attitude to have.

891
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:25,410
What the fuck do you want?
Take off this strap.

892
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:27,778
[Dr. Death] You know, that's
the problem I have with you.

893
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,698
I don't like your language.

894
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:31,522
Hmm?

895
00:54:31,554 --> 00:54:34,946
Now, I'm gonna have to stick
to drastic measures.

896
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:37,826
Drastic measures? What the fuck
are you talking about?

897
00:54:38,882 --> 00:54:40,162
What the fuck is that?

898
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,786
What the fuck is that!
What are you doing?

899
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,786
[Dr. Death] Now, I know
this must look scary to you.

900
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:50,306
But it's actually quite simple.

901
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:52,801
And rather efficient.

902
00:54:53,282 --> 00:54:55,266
The procedure I'm about to do

903
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:57,378
is called
a transorbital lobotomy.

904
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:59,841
Mm-hmm?

905
00:55:00,193 --> 00:55:02,401
-Oh, yes.
-[Badger] What are you doing?

906
00:55:02,434 --> 00:55:04,162
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

907
00:55:04,194 --> 00:55:07,906
What the fuck are you doing?
No! [screams]

908
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:10,945
[distant screaming]

909
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:22,946
[Dr. Death] Oh, baby, oh, yes,
that's more like it.

910
00:55:26,817 --> 00:55:28,577
[grunting]

911
00:55:41,186 --> 00:55:42,369
Perfect.

912
00:55:42,402 --> 00:55:44,353
How does that feel?
Hmm?

913
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:47,298
Hello?

914
00:55:50,369 --> 00:55:51,777
Anybody home?

915
00:55:54,817 --> 00:55:55,873
[sighs]

916
00:55:58,049 --> 00:55:59,297
That worked.

917
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:01,537
Hmm.

918
00:56:17,314 --> 00:56:19,842
[Sarah sobs]

919
00:56:33,186 --> 00:56:34,465
[knocking on door]

920
00:56:43,842 --> 00:56:45,762
[continues sobbing]

921
00:56:50,722 --> 00:56:52,257
I see you're upset.

922
00:56:53,217 --> 00:56:54,593
I'm sorry to worry you.

923
00:56:55,618 --> 00:56:59,810
We have a very strict policy
about our patient safety.

924
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:03,233
The sad truth of the matter
is that there are many times

925
00:57:03,265 --> 00:57:06,690
that they are in danger
of hurting themselves,

926
00:57:06,721 --> 00:57:08,993
and we have to protect them
from themselves.

927
00:57:13,537 --> 00:57:15,233
You have to trust me
here on this.

928
00:57:16,193 --> 00:57:17,665
It's for the best.

929
00:57:17,698 --> 00:57:20,482
-No, no, no. [coughing]
-[Dr. Death] Come on, hey.

930
00:57:20,513 --> 00:57:22,402
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

931
00:57:22,722 --> 00:57:24,481
[groaning]

932
00:57:28,385 --> 00:57:30,017
[choking]

933
00:57:40,705 --> 00:57:42,017
[exhales]

934
00:57:45,665 --> 00:57:47,073
How does that feel?

935
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:52,097
I'll be back later.
We'll try it again.

936
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:06,466
That's Sarah's camera.

937
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:08,993
Oh, no.

938
00:58:13,378 --> 00:58:15,841
This is getting scary.
Should we call the police?

939
00:58:15,873 --> 00:58:17,730
I'm sure they're fine.

940
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:19,842
But I don't have
any reception at all.

941
00:58:21,153 --> 00:58:22,978
All right. Let's go upstairs
and look for them.

942
00:58:29,633 --> 00:58:31,266
Guys, this is the room.

943
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:35,937
[Jake] Yeah.

944
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,345
-Love this.
-[Jake] Yeah.

945
00:58:37,378 --> 00:58:38,401
So love them.

946
00:58:42,657 --> 00:58:44,673
The fatal faithful room.

947
00:58:45,473 --> 00:58:46,786
Who cares?

948
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,802
Well, this is the room

949
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,433
where the guy
got his nuts chopped off.

950
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:11,265
[Dr. Death] Hello?

951
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:15,586
You got to help me.

952
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:18,306
I'm in a...

953
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:20,033
-Please help me.
-[Dr. Death] Of course.

954
00:59:20,065 --> 00:59:22,306
-Of course, I can help you.
-Okay.

955
00:59:22,337 --> 00:59:23,521
[Dr. Death] As your doctor,

956
00:59:23,554 --> 00:59:26,338
I'm morally obligated
to help you.

957
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:27,841
What are you talking about?

958
00:59:27,873 --> 00:59:28,833
[Dr. Death] But you
understand...

959
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:29,730
Get me out of here.

960
00:59:29,761 --> 00:59:32,962
...we can't have patients
running around,

961
00:59:32,993 --> 00:59:35,553
making babies
with other patients around here.

962
00:59:35,586 --> 00:59:37,697
What the fuck
are you talking about?

963
00:59:37,729 --> 00:59:40,546
-Get me out of here.
-[Dr. Death] Now, listen.

964
00:59:40,737 --> 00:59:41,762
You got to help me.

965
00:59:41,794 --> 00:59:44,033
-[Dr. Death] Of course, I will.
-You got to help me.

966
00:59:44,065 --> 00:59:44,961
[Dr. Death] Calm down,

967
00:59:44,993 --> 00:59:48,482
I will help you
as soon as we get you fixed.

968
00:59:48,514 --> 00:59:49,729
Okay?

969
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:54,082
It's a simple procedure really.

970
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:56,833
-Just...
-What are you doing?

971
00:59:56,866 --> 00:59:58,082
...hold still.

972
00:59:58,114 --> 00:59:58,882
What are you doing?

973
00:59:58,913 --> 01:00:00,577
[Dr. Death]
I don't wanna nick you.

974
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:03,682
Wait. What are you doing?
No. No!

975
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,762
[screams]

976
01:00:25,697 --> 01:00:26,657
[Dr. Death] Oh.

977
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,577
That worked.

978
01:00:49,986 --> 01:00:52,225
How would cutting off a guy's
scrotum make him less crazy?

979
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:53,345
My balls make me crazy.

980
01:00:53,602 --> 01:00:55,426
[Amelia] Do you ever
wash them occasionally?

981
01:00:55,457 --> 01:00:56,386
That's so not cool.

982
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:59,073
How could a bro
do that to another bro's junk?

983
01:00:59,105 --> 01:01:00,930
Beware of the junk snipper.

984
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:03,169
He lurks these hallways,
he'll cut off your wiener.

985
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:04,322
If you have one.

986
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:07,617
-[loud thud]
-[Jasmine] What the fuck?

987
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,889
And no, it wasn't
the fucking junk snipper, Jake!

988
01:01:09,922 --> 01:01:11,841
Well, maybe it was Dr. Death.

989
01:01:11,873 --> 01:01:13,793
Or one of his victims,
trying to escape.

990
01:01:13,826 --> 01:01:15,681
[Cody] It's probably
just the wind, guys.

991
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,601
Maybe we were
just getting all the...

992
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:20,193
currents converging
on this spot.

993
01:01:20,225 --> 01:01:21,506
I bet it happens every night.

994
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:24,257
It scares the shit out of...
[laughs] ...little kids.

995
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:26,785
It's not a ghost.
It's, like,

996
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:29,121
when the doors shuts in your
own house on a windy day.

997
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:30,721
-It's all--
-[loud thud]

998
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:33,409
[metal scraping]

999
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,673
All right. I don't know physics.

1000
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:38,593
But what the fuck
was that, genius?

1001
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:41,217
Well, that sounds like
a psychopathic,

1002
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:44,417
ghost murderer,
scraping rusty blades to get us.

1003
01:01:45,346 --> 01:01:47,937
-Wanna check it out?
-Okay.

1004
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:51,137
Hey, guys, meet back
in the hallway where we came in.

1005
01:02:39,905 --> 01:02:40,993
Aren't you afraid
of Dr. Death?

1006
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:43,681
Please! That's just a story.

1007
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:48,737
I mean, it's a true story,
but those sounds weren't him.

1008
01:02:50,305 --> 01:02:52,289
Now, if you're done
interrupting,

1009
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:53,473
I can finish the story.

1010
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:57,857
And it might be the last time

1011
01:02:57,889 --> 01:02:59,394
you guys get a chance
to hear it.

1012
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:03,105
[Megan] Sarah!

1013
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:04,897
Badger!

1014
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:06,434
Elden?

1015
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:08,897
Maybe they're high again.

1016
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:10,082
I hate it when
he does that shit.

1017
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:11,297
Scott!

1018
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,417
What's that smell?

1019
01:03:14,593 --> 01:03:15,682
Isn't that the morgue?

1020
01:03:22,402 --> 01:03:23,394
Scott.

1021
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:30,657
He's fucking dead.

1022
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:32,194
[Willard] I told you
you shouldn't be here.

1023
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:33,409
[Jesse] He's right.

1024
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:36,385
-We gotta find everybody else.
-[Megan] You get us out of here.

1025
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:44,353
[Megan] This is locked!

1026
01:03:45,538 --> 01:03:46,913
No!

1027
01:03:47,201 --> 01:03:48,929
[Jesse grunts]

1028
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:51,009
Goddamnit!
Fuck this!

1029
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,897
-Megan, no!
-I will kill you.

1030
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:55,042
No! Megan, come on.

1031
01:03:55,074 --> 01:03:57,826
I can hear you,
I can fucking hear you!

1032
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,257
Show yourselves!

1033
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:01,505
Show yourselves!

1034
01:04:01,858 --> 01:04:03,329
Come and get me!

1035
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:05,506
[indistinct whispers]

1036
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,353
[Megan screams]

1037
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:13,346
Hello? We're at Pennhurst.

1038
01:04:13,665 --> 01:04:15,073
Someone's trying to kill...

1039
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:16,098
Damn it!

1040
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:32,161
Megan, it's Willard. Come on.

1041
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,601
-[children laughing]
-[indistinct whispers]

1042
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,521
I thought you said
this is the safest way out?

1043
01:05:00,514 --> 01:05:02,114
We should leave this place now.

1044
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:13,505
Badger, Scott's dead.
We have to go.

1045
01:05:16,866 --> 01:05:19,297
[whimpers]

1046
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:22,306
We have to go.
We have to go!

1047
01:05:25,857 --> 01:05:27,265
-[Megan] Sarah!
-[Jesse] Keep moving.

1048
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,801
-Keep moving.
-Sarah!

1049
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,114
[Jesse] Just go, keep going.

1050
01:05:38,465 --> 01:05:40,514
Wait. No, no, no,
why are we going down?

1051
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:42,177
Down is the only way out now.

1052
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:17,954
-Where's Willard?
-He was just right there.

1053
01:06:35,138 --> 01:06:37,122
[Jesse] Oh, my God! No!

1054
01:06:37,154 --> 01:06:38,146
Go. Go!

1055
01:06:38,434 --> 01:06:39,777
Go, Megan!

1056
01:06:40,386 --> 01:06:41,954
[screams]

1057
01:07:01,506 --> 01:07:02,817
[breathing heavily]

1058
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:05,122
What are you doing here?

1059
01:07:07,681 --> 01:07:09,058
How did you get here?

1060
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,553
I've always been here.

1061
01:07:12,674 --> 01:07:15,554
Who are you?
What are you?

1062
01:07:15,586 --> 01:07:17,538
I'm trying to help you.

1063
01:07:17,569 --> 01:07:19,458
We're all trying to help you,
to protect you.

1064
01:07:20,322 --> 01:07:22,113
Protect me from what?

1065
01:07:22,146 --> 01:07:24,258
[pounding]

1066
01:07:30,657 --> 01:07:32,416
-[pounding continues]
-From them.

1067
01:07:36,674 --> 01:07:38,337
I don't know what's going on,

1068
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:39,778
but I just
wanna get out of here.

1069
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:42,112
[pounding]

1070
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:52,002
[scraping]

1071
01:07:52,962 --> 01:07:53,922
What is that?

1072
01:07:56,449 --> 01:07:57,409
Willard, no!

1073
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:01,216
I was killed by the people

1074
01:08:01,249 --> 01:08:03,458
who were supposed to take care
of me years ago.

1075
01:08:06,338 --> 01:08:07,458
Pennhurst is my home.

1076
01:08:08,386 --> 01:08:09,538
Just like you, Chris.

1077
01:08:23,425 --> 01:08:24,706
You know my name.

1078
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:26,785
Willard, you're a ghost?

1079
01:08:27,905 --> 01:08:30,625
Chris Benham was the last
patient released from Pennhurst.

1080
01:08:32,322 --> 01:08:34,178
He was barely 18 years old.

1081
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,002
No family would take him in.

1082
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:43,746
No friends, nobody.

1083
01:08:46,753 --> 01:08:48,802
Pennhurst was the only home
he ever knew.

1084
01:08:49,602 --> 01:08:50,754
Its time, Chris.

1085
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:53,634
[grunts]

1086
01:08:56,353 --> 01:08:57,985
I'm not like you.

1087
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:02,817
I'm helping these people.

1088
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:08,833
I'm not like you!

1089
01:09:10,593 --> 01:09:12,256
I'm not-- [groans]

1090
01:09:14,562 --> 01:09:17,282
-[Chris groaning]
-[Megan panting]

1091
01:09:33,698 --> 01:09:35,618
-[gasps, whimpers]
-It's okay, it's okay.

1092
01:09:37,025 --> 01:09:38,562
It's okay.

1093
01:09:41,313 --> 01:09:43,137
It's okay. It's okay.

1094
01:10:24,898 --> 01:10:27,297
The spirits
weren't trying to hurt us,

1095
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,738
they were trying to protect us.

1096
01:10:35,266 --> 01:10:37,153
[officer] Ladies, are you sure
there's five bodies in there?

1097
01:10:37,186 --> 01:10:38,209
[Megan] Yes.

1098
01:10:38,242 --> 01:10:39,746
[officer]
I'm only counting four.

1099
01:10:41,218 --> 01:10:44,449
Well, let's get down
to the hospital,

1100
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:45,602
get you guys checked out.

1101
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:07,553
[engine starts]

1102
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,289
[Cody]
Let's go to that door.

1103
01:11:20,322 --> 01:11:22,146
[Jenny screams sarcastically]

1104
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:24,066
[Jenny] I don't like
being alone down here,

1105
01:11:24,097 --> 01:11:25,697
do you know where you're going?

1106
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:27,584
[indistinct chatter, chuckling]

1107
01:11:32,769 --> 01:11:34,114
Let's forget about this,
can we just go?

1108
01:11:34,145 --> 01:11:35,746
Guys, just chill out.

1109
01:11:35,778 --> 01:11:37,698
-It's nothing.
-[Amelia] Where are they?

1110
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:39,522
[Vincent] Cody,
get the fuck down here.

1111
01:11:39,553 --> 01:11:40,801
-I'm not kidding!
-Jenny!

1112
01:11:40,834 --> 01:11:43,106
This is not funny,
this is not a funny joke!

1113
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:44,386
Where the fuck are you guys?

1114
01:11:44,418 --> 01:11:46,306
-[Cody] Coming!
-[Jenny] Hi, guys!

1115
01:11:46,338 --> 01:11:48,322
[Jake] Oh, Jesus!
This isn't funny!

1116
01:11:48,353 --> 01:11:50,242
[Vincent] We do not
want to be here all night.

1117
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,329
-Let's get out of here.
-I'm sorry.

1118
01:11:51,713 --> 01:11:53,314
[Amelia] Whatever happened
to the film crew?

1119
01:11:53,345 --> 01:11:54,882
Never heard from again.

1120
01:11:54,913 --> 01:11:56,450
-Dr. Death got them.
-[Jasmine] That's not funny.

1121
01:11:56,737 --> 01:11:58,913
Well, it's just how it happened.

1122
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:04,673
You're real.

1123
01:12:04,705 --> 01:12:05,633
-Shit!
-[knife slicing]

1124
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:08,193
[screaming]

1125
01:12:16,225 --> 01:12:18,530
-[man] Get them up? Great.
-[man 2] Yup.

1126
01:12:18,561 --> 01:12:21,121
We're back here at
Pennhurst State School Asylum.

1127
01:12:21,154 --> 01:12:23,009
We came back, we were here
a couple years ago,

1128
01:12:23,235 --> 01:12:25,217
and we had some really
interesting findings.

1129
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,818
So, as a result,
we came back again,

1130
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:28,673
because we're trying
to disprove some of those

1131
01:12:28,705 --> 01:12:30,433
with more information
and background.

1132
01:12:30,466 --> 01:12:32,226
As you know,
Pennhurst was a mental asylum,

1133
01:12:32,257 --> 01:12:33,601
and it was used to house

1134
01:12:33,634 --> 01:12:35,777
a lot of the criminally insane
in the area.

1135
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,178
And, unfortunately,
the nature of the business,

1136
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:40,354
it just so happens
that a lot of the patients

1137
01:12:40,385 --> 01:12:43,490
are brutalized, victimized,
taken advantage of.

1138
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:45,441
And, unfortunately,
that's just how it is.

1139
01:12:45,473 --> 01:12:46,753
That's what it is.

1140
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:50,753
Is that blood?

1141
01:12:50,785 --> 01:12:51,553
Sure is.

1142
01:12:55,457 --> 01:12:56,578
[man] All right, guys,
this isn't right.

1143
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:02,401
-Holy shit!
-[woman] Oh, my God.

1144
01:13:03,841 --> 01:13:05,666
-[man] Oh, my God.
-[woman] What happened?

1145
01:13:11,682 --> 01:13:12,898
-Oh, my God!
-That is brutal.
