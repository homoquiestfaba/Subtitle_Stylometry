1
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,916
A brief hello from Milan.

2
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,318
We've had a very nice time.

3
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,654
Madeleine is well set-up here.

4
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,691
She told me to extend an invitation.

5
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:26,725
Maybe next summer?

6
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,863
Looking forward to New York
and to seeing you.

7
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,432
There's a lot for us
to talk about, too.

8
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,035
See you soon.

9
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:36,935
David.

10
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,065
But, if you see,
then from here did you see

11
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,467
this is Jonathan's study.

12
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,002
Very necessary.

13
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,570
Are those the same dimensions
that are there now?

14
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,005
Didn't even exist.

15
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,342
We just four-walled
part of the living room.

16
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,509
Oh, right.

17
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,978
Yeah.

18
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,380
And that's where we're standing?

19
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,815
Correct.

20
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,017
This door, which will no longer
be here, that is the door

21
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:12,884
right there.

22
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,092
- I know.

23
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:20,993
- Remember that.

24
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,349
It's the last time
you'll see them.

25
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,036
- Are you on a blood thinner?

26
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,171
That's fine.

27
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,842
Start with 20 milligrams and
go up to 25 after a week.

28
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,814
Yeah, yeah, sometimes dizziness,

29
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,217
sometimes nausea,
but usually nothing.

30
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:21,820
Only once.

31
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,424
No.

32
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,992
30 days.

33
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,026
This is very safe.

34
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,294
It's a very safe drug.

35
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,180
No one ever gave me money.

36
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,678
I left my parents' house early,

37
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,879
because I remembered what it was

38
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,647
like to have to wait between trains.

39
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,099
I wanted to deposit
the check someplace,

40
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,701
since I didn't like the idea

41
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,503
of carrying it around in my wallet.

42
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,839
But I hadn't seen Todd in a long time.

43
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,742
And I worried it would be in
bad taste to talk about money.

44
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,589
I'd known Todd since college.

45
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,025
He moved to the city a few years ago,

46
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,994
and he was living off a fellowship

47
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,162
that allowed him to work full time

48
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,531
on a biography he was writing

49
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,367
of an American political
theorist named Stephen Taubes.

50
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,971
I knew little about Taubes
other than that

51
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,507
Todd and his roommate Brandon,

52
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,409
who was helping him
with the biography,

53
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,446
thought very highly of him
and were working closely

54
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,480
with his estate.

55
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,218
Todd's work could take
years to finish, he told me.

56
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,221
There was much to be
cleared up for the record,

57
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:39,291
and a good deal of intellectual
rehabilitation was in store.

58
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,994
I didn't ask him what
he meant by this.

59
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,199
But when he offered to bring
me on as a research assistant,

60
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,667
and after he mentioned in passing

61
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,569
that Taubes's history
had been contentions

62
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,738
for many years and weighted
down by controversy,

63
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,574
I quickly learned that some things

64
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,142
were better left unspoken.

65
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,091
And then we were at Don's,

66
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,692
and we used to know this
guy who worked there.

67
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,327
And he came up to us
and started talking,

68
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,596
and Casey and I were all of
a sudden taking directions

69
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,531
to his apartment.

70
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,798
And we must've been wasted,

71
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,468
because it was four in
the morning, and then,

72
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,702
all of a sudden, he was there,

73
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,838
and he was telling us
what he was selling.

74
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,140
It was so weird!

75
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,509
What time did you get back?

76
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,978
I don't know, like 8:00.

77
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,647
I was so tired!

78
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,614
Was Mandy there?

79
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,549
No.

80
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,317
Mandy thankfully was not there.

81
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,518
Who's Mandy?

82
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,720
You met Mandy.

83
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,856
She's the girl with
the really long hair.

84
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:18,857
She's kind of tall.

85
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,058
No, you know!

86
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,593
She was at Conner's thing in April.

87
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,395
Is this the one
who faked the abortion?

88
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,963
She is such a wreck.

89
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,332
Very strange.

90
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,833
Very fun-house.

91
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,402
So, do you even know
what this thing is?

92
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,870
What does this guy do?

93
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,706
I think it's a video installation

94
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,176
based on '90s TV shows.

95
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,047
And then he syncs them up to
old clips of Waco and O.J.

96
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:42,981
Shows?

97
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:43,915
You mean sitcoms?

98
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,016
That sounds good.

99
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,675
I had two job interviews.

100
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,846
My brother gave me
an old suit to wear,

101
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,214
but it didn't fit me well,

102
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,817
and I needed to find
a tailor who could

103
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,219
shorten the arms and legs
by the end of the week.

104
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,272
There was a box of
videotapes on the floor

105
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,141
among the papers in Todd's apartment.

106
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,412
When I mentioned this, Todd told me

107
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,114
that Taubes kept video recordings

108
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,384
of all of his travels during
the last 20 years of his life.

109
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,120
Most of my work would be devoted to

110
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,089
itemizing these tapes and
describing their contents.

111
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,027
We watched one of them
for a few minutes.

112
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,198
Sometimes voices were
heard and faces were seen.

113
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,335
But I didn't understand
what the tapes were for

114
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,503
or why they were made.

115
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,474
Usually, the camera stayed put,

116
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,111
or else the video cut
abruptly to a different view.

117
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,315
I rarely saw anyone in
any of these recordings.

118
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,452
Their importance was unclear.

119
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,458
- How do you know each other?

120
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,392
- From Bard.

121
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,161
We were in the same program.

122
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,595
- Is this your first time here?

123
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:38,897
- No.

124
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,965
I came last summer to
look for an apartment,

125
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,501
but I ended up staying
with my parents.

126
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,402
Where are you from?

127
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,704
- Chappaqua.

128
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,439
- And you already found a job?

129
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:51,509
Not yet, but I have
two interviews next week.

130
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,977
- Where?

131
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,614
- One is for a part-time
clerical job at a law office.

132
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,451
The other's in Tribeca,
at a restaurant.

133
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,553
Have you thought about tutoring?

134
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,488
- I've never tutored before.

135
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,657
It can pay well.

136
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,092
You're a good enough writer.

137
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,627
I'm sure you can find
something through an agency.

138
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,929
What do you write?

139
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,698
I haven't written
much since school.

140
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,433
I'm writing some short stories now.

141
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,602
- Have you published anything?

142
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,838
- Not yet, but I'm trying to.

143
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,005
Oh, you should.

144
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,407
At your age, you should
be placing pieces

145
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,708
in as many outlets as possible.

146
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,113
- Do you write?

147
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,481
- Sometimes.

148
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,550
I'm finishing a dissertation
and I translate,

149
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,352
so that takes up most of my time.

150
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,820
I can introduce you to someone,

151
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,422
if you're interested in tutoring.

152
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,523
Thanks.

153
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:39,858
I don't want to be a bother.

154
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,792
- It's not a bother.

155
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,327
He may have some ideas.

156
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,428
- Should we go?

157
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,396
- Mm-hmm, do you want to walk?

158
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,264
- Yeah, that's fine.

159
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,132
Let's walk.

160
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,909
I made a pot of coffee and wrote

161
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,211
for a little while after they left.

162
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,071
From the fifth floor,
you could see the rest

163
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,139
of the neighborhood.

164
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,011
There was a big construction
site across the street,

165
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,979
for a new apartment
building, I think.

166
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,850
Todd told me that the whole area

167
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,718
would be unrecognizable in a year.

168
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,856
I tried to imagine the new view.

169
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,724
He's farther away here.

170
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:40,858
We can crop it later.

171
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:45,296
This one's clearer.

172
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,467
Something like this?

173
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:50,835
Is that one recent?

174
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,570
I have a few more from April.

175
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,806
This one's from last winter.

176
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:00,711
Are they coming here?

177
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,246
- His father might.

178
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,147
I don't know.

179
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,451
Did he know
anyone else in the city?

180
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,019
- I spoke to his cousin.

181
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,488
Maybe he can help.

182
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,890
- Can we talk to him?

183
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,092
He knows I'm here.

184
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,327
I can call him again.

185
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,629
- Do you know where he lives?

186
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,264
He lives in Queens.

187
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,201
- I work now.

188
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,036
I don't have the time
I had five or six months ago.

189
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,304
Even if he did,

190
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,672
I doubt I'd have
a chance to see him.

191
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,442
We're both working overtime.

192
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,310
Diana's parents
have had to help us.

193
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:07,611
My father's trying
to get my foreman

194
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,814
to renegotiate my contract.

195
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,750
But I'd still be taking home
less than I did last year.

196
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,717
David's parents made things very

197
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,319
difficult for me and my wife.

198
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,988
They cheated my
parents out of a lot.

199
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,123
My grandmother was very sick,

200
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,624
and they refused to take her.

201
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,294
I know my father doesn't
speak to them anymore,

202
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,229
and we don't ever hear from David,

203
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,565
but I never stopped him
from trying to call us.

204
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,400
- Do you ever talk to Julius?

205
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,702
Not a lot.

206
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,171
I don't think he kept
in touch with David.

207
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,706
Who's Julius?

208
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,708
He was a good friend
of my brother's.

209
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,009
He went to high school with David.

210
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,078
Should we talk to him?

211
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,047
- He doesn't live here anymore.

212
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,515
I haven't seen him in years.

213
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,151
I can try to find the address,

214
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,252
but I'd really prefer it
if you didn't tell him

215
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,487
you came here.

216
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,354
How you doing?

217
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:58,622
How are you?

218
00:25:58,624 --> 00:25:59,857
Man, I had to
work since nine or 10.

219
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,091
Really?

220
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,626
Yeah, last time
I went in, I went in.

221
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,398
This was last time.

222
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,799
Where at, here?

223
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:12,269
No, the lake on Cathcart,
I was carrying my son.

224
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,531
- We'd like to get started.

225
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,035
Thank you for coming.

226
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:49,039
This is the first of three
panels on translation.

227
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,642
In October, we'll be joined
by Natasha Wimmer,

228
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,510
who will discuss her experience

229
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:56,313
translating Alvaro Enrigue's
Sudden Death,

230
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:59,416
which was put out by
Riverhead Books in February.

231
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:03,420
Tonight, we're fortunate
to have three very smart,

232
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,823
very talented translators,

233
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,525
whom I'll introduce,
starting with Keith Cohen,

234
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,426
to my left.

235
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:13,597
Keith's translation of
Danilo Kis's Early Sorrows

236
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,101
is forthcoming with
Dalkey Archive Press,

237
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,504
and he's a frequent contributor
to n+1, The Believer,

238
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:23,641
Tin House, and Bookforum.

239
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:27,011
In July, Keith was named one
of our most promising young

240
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,613
translators of fiction
and poetry into English

241
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,215
by the New York Times,

242
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,617
and in April he received
a Guggenheim fellowship

243
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,353
for his work in literary criticism.

244
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,890
To Keith's left is Christian Haley,

245
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:43,127
an editor at Triple Canopy
and a frequent contributor

246
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,295
to The New Inquiry, Bookforum,

247
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,931
the London Review of Books,
and n+1.

248
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:51,902
In March, Archipelago Books
will publish his

249
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,405
translations of Kleist's
poetry and prose.

250
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:58,175
Christian is also a
professor of German Studies

251
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,245
at Sarah Lawrence and is
currently editing a volume

252
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:04,114
on Friedrich Schleiermacher
and 19th-century

253
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:08,419
German theology, expected from
Princeton University Press

254
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:09,687
in January.

255
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,956
To his left is Karin Apter.

256
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,826
Karin is a doctoral candidate
in Comparative Literature

257
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,295
at Columbia University

258
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:21,532
and has written extensively
on Latin American literature,

259
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,134
poetry and politics.

260
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,904
Her work can be found in
the London Review of Books,

261
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,373
Jacobin, Harper's, Dissent,

262
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,309
Cinema Scope, The New Inquiry,

263
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,944
the Times Literary Supplement,

264
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,513
and most recently in n+1,

265
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,450
for which she's translated
poems by Roberto Bolano.

266
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,087
In December, her translations

267
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,256
of García Lorca will be
published by New Directions,

268
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,725
and she's currently
preparing a book

269
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,561
on Fernando Solanas
and Argentine cinema.

270
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,597
Our format tonight
will be three talks

271
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,166
followed by a brief
question-and-answer session,

272
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,869
during which we'll open up
the floor for discussion.

273
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,038
Please join me
in welcoming our panelists.

274
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,145
And I was just sort of wondering,

275
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,481
because you mentioned
Danilo Kis, right?

276
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,851
This thing that happens where
writers become more famous

277
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,586
in countries than their own,

278
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,489
is this just a problem
of publishing in general?

279
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,526
- Because all of us read more
than one language, right?

280
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,328
So, I wanted to ask
if you could speak

281
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,929
to this issue of displacement,

282
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,466
when you have this slippage
and when you want

283
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,068
to say something but somehow it...

284
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,212
Do we think of this
as just another failure

285
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,680
of late capitalism,

286
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:46,450
or as another homogenizing
impulse of capitalism

287
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,551
as it expands?

288
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:54,758
Please join me
in thanking our panelists.

289
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,157
Do you think this is uninteresting?

290
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,592
- I think it's beneath you.

291
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,996
Why are you
so preoccupied with it?

292
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,798
Because he's a friend of mine.

293
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,300
- But what does it matter?

294
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:37,835
You did what you could.

295
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,304
Do you think he's going to
come back and scold you?

296
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,306
- No, I don't think that.

297
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:44,575
Then why do you
feel guilty about it?

298
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,612
- I don't know if I feel guilty.

299
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,113
You shouldn't.

300
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,282
But I don't even know
where he is or if he's safe.

301
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,885
I think it's pointless
to talk about this.

302
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,053
He's gone.

303
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,288
If he comes back, then he does.

304
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,023
This is really so stupid.

305
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,960
You're not even making
an effort to be helpful.

306
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:03,894
- Oh, get over yourself.

307
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,230
You sound like a wounded mother.

308
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,298
Some of us have been
working very hard

309
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,700
this past year on something

310
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,034
that's incredibly important
to the direction

311
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,502
we want this country to go in,

312
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:16,039
and what you're telling me
has absolutely no importance.

313
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,541
It's a non-event.

314
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,644
It bores me, and I wish
we wouldn't talk about it.

315
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:21,612
It's a distraction,

316
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:22,946
and as far as I'm concerned,

317
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,148
it's something that
never even happened.

318
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,049
What time did you leave?

319
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,684
Super late.

320
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,385
God, I went home with Dane.

321
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,254
What a horrible idea.

322
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:38,722
Which one was Dane?

323
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,157
He was the one that
went to the Cooper Union.

324
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,159
He came with Shane and Zerlina.

325
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,493
You went to his place?

326
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:44,761
No.

327
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,029
We couldn't.

328
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,197
I was like,
"Dude, my place is all the way

329
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,398
"out in Fort Greene."

330
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,599
"My roommate's going to be there."

331
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,334
And he's like, "No, no, it's fine."

332
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,702
"Don't worry."

333
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,003
So, we end up at my place.

334
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,438
Shannon's door is already shut.

335
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,672
We go into my room.

336
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,343
The next morning, I get this really

337
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,844
passive-aggressive E-mail

338
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,379
that's telling me
I can't bring boys over

339
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:04,214
anymore because it's
rude and inconsiderate.

340
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,350
She said that to you?

341
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,551
I'm not kidding.

342
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,353
It's like, I'm sorry, I pay rent,

343
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,620
I'm 26 years old.

344
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,555
Get over yourself!

345
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:12,723
That's ridiculous, man.

346
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:13,657
You should get a new place.

347
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,458
Try to kick her out.

348
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,726
I wish.

349
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,694
You know what you should do?

350
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,030
You could kill her and make
it look like an accident.

351
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:20,864
Yeah!

352
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:21,798
I'll do it for you.

353
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,033
That's horrible.

354
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,501
These are horrible times.

355
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,748
Buying books?

356
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,184
- Hi.

357
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,685
We saw you through the window.

358
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,687
- Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

359
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,889
I was in Senegal for five weeks.

360
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,291
Do you know Gabe?

361
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,125
- I don't think so.

362
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:55,959
Hi.

363
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,360
- Nice to meet you.

364
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,962
- Were you on your way?

365
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,031
No, I just wanted to take a walk.

366
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,299
- Why don't you join us?

367
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,900
We're going to an opening.

368
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:04,835
- An opening?

369
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:06,169
- Gabe's friend's in a show.

370
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,938
There's going to be
a reception with drinks.

371
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,306
- Oh.

372
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,074
Do you have plans?

373
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,409
- No, I don't have plans.

374
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,243
- Come with us.

375
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,178
It starts in an hour.

376
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,793
- Do you usually do this?

377
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,863
Would it bother you if I did?

378
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:41,765
- I don't know.

379
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,369
Don't you think it seems impulsive?

380
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,637
I was bored.

381
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,039
Does it matter?

382
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,574
- No.

383
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:52,475
I'll be gone in a few weeks.

384
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,244
- Where are you going?

385
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,078
Hungary.

386
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,979
Maybe Romania.

387
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,516
What are you doing in Hungary?

388
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,151
- I don't know.

389
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:02,586
Just see what
it's like for a while.

390
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:03,920
A few friends are coming.

391
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,288
We've had enough of this city.

392
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,557
There's nothing really
keeping us here.

393
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,993
What will you do for money?

394
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,328
- I don't know.

395
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:14,864
A friend's cooking dinner.

396
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,700
If you come,
you could talk to them.

397
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:17,968
They'll all be there.

398
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,936
We'll be celebrating
our independence.

399
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:53,903
Do you live in the neighborhood?

400
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:54,938
- Nope.

401
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,872
- Just visiting friends?

402
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,173
- I was invited.

403
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,875
I don't know any of the artists.

404
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,043
We all went to school together.

405
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:00,944
- Oh.

406
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:02,779
- What do you do?

407
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,613
- I'm a student.

408
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,948
- In the city?

409
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,982
- Yep.

410
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,350
- Are you from around here?

411
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,019
- No, I grow up in Arizona.

412
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,320
- Do you ever go back?

413
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:11,621
- Not really.

414
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,555
Are you from New York?

415
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:14,090
- No, I was born in Boston.

416
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:16,359
My parents moved here
when I was in middle school.

417
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,794
- Your parents live in the city?

418
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,897
- No, my father died on 9/11.

419
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:21,998
My mother's very sick.

420
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,566
We're not able to speak.

421
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:24,768
- I'm sorry.

422
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,669
- It's okay.

423
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,939
Are you expecting someone else?

424
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:30,840
- No.

425
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,610
Why don't we go to the other room?

426
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,790
Most of this is gone now.

427
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,362
When were these taken?

428
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,931
At least 100 years ago.

429
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:02,105
Ceausescu destroyed most of this.

430
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,742
It isn't him.

431
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:28,811
Doctor Stephens,
Doctor Alfred Stephens.

432
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,547
Doctor Powers,
Doctor Edward Powers.

433
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,716
Doctor Sholom,
Doctor Stephen Sholom.

434
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:37,053
Doctor Braiden,
Doctor Anthony Braiden.

435
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,514
- Are you hungry?

436
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,517
I can't think of eating anything.

437
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,556
I don't want to do anything.

438
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:50,727
I want to leave.

439
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:58,901
- How do you feel?

440
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,572
I'm still tired.

441
00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:04,741
Do you want to go back to sleep?

442
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:05,642
- No.

443
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,345
I think I'll feel better
when I'm on my way back.

444
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,183
I can't think of
anything else we can do.

445
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:16,853
I think we did everything we could.

446
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:21,124
- Part of me wants to stay.

447
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:22,025
- Why?

448
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:25,528
Because I don't think
I did everything

449
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,429
I could do.

450
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,465
- Could you do anything more?

451
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:34,337
He's not going to reappear
because you keep looking for him.

452
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:35,405
I know.

453
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:40,443
I'm frightened.

454
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:41,744
- Why are you frightened?

455
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:47,550
What's frightening you?

456
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,919
- I don't know.

457
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,025
I don't want him to be gone.

458
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:02,265
The idea of him not existing
anymore frightens me.

459
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:03,566
- But why do you think that?

460
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:07,670
You'll see David again.

461
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:11,040
I don't think
I believe that anymore.

462
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,742
- But you should believe it.

463
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,614
I wish I could distract myself.

464
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:19,515
- You can.

465
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:21,584
- How?

466
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:23,186
- By leaving.

467
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:24,187
It's not difficult.

468
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:30,927
Don't let this get to your head.

469
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,249
<i>I think of the words</i>

470
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:10,319
<i>of the great Russian nihilist
Nechayev when he says,</i>

471
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:14,490
<i>Day and night,
we must have but one thought,</i>

472
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:17,159
<i>one aim, and that's death.</i>

473
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:20,529
<i>The death of individuals,
the death of consciousness,</i>

474
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,331
<i>the death of politics.</i>

475
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:26,068
<i>The true victory, the true freedom,</i>

476
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:30,172
<i>isn't appeasement and compromise,
but annihilation.</i>

477
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,587
<i>They say that liberal democracy</i>

478
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,956
<i>is the best of all possible worlds.</i>

479
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,059
<i>They spit in our faces
with their homilies.</i>

480
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:52,995
<i>They give us platitudes
about values.</i>

481
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:56,899
<i>They poison us with their talk
about the truth.</i>

482
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:59,435
<i>But who are they
to talk about values</i>

483
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,438
<i>when their wallets grow thick
each time they stab</i>

484
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,673
<i>us in the back?</i>

485
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:05,675
<i>Who are they to talk about truth?</i>

486
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:10,880
<i>Who among us
still believes in the lie</i>

487
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:13,149
<i>about the sanctity of human life?</i>

488
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:16,552
<i>Who among us can continue
to go on walking on tiptoe</i>

489
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:20,122
<i>for fear of offending
the hypocrites, the scum,</i>

490
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,724
<i>who have been peddling this garbage</i>

491
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:24,160
<i>to us for the last 30 years?</i>

492
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,903
<i>Let them suffer and disappear.</i>

493
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:37,540
<i>I'm not going to answer their
attacks on me by pleading.</i>

494
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:42,244
<i>Their language of reform is
appalling and unworthy of me.</i>

495
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:45,047
<i>What they don't realize
is that there are more</i>

496
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:47,616
<i>of us than they think.</i>

497
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:51,153
<i>One day, and I promise you one day,</i>

498
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,255
<i>and it won't be long from now,</i>

499
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:57,960
<i>this entire sickly order
is going to implode.</i>

500
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,563
<i>It won't announce itself outright.</i>

501
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:04,266
<i>It's not going to be a matter
of barricades or slogans.</i>

502
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:07,003
<i>But I promise, it will happen.</i>

503
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:10,272
<i>We are not going away.</i>

504
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:06,896
- Hi.

505
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:07,730
Hi.

506
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:08,898
- Where have you been?

507
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,565
We thought something had happened.

508
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,733
No,

509
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:11,867
I was taking Madeleine
to the station.

510
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,002
- Everything all right?

511
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:13,936
Yeah.

512
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:14,970
- We're all inside.

513
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,049
How was the food?

514
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,851
It was fine.

515
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:38,053
Moroccan food is cheap.

516
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:40,322
We found these great
tajines in Chefchaouen.

517
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:44,860
Where's that?

518
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:47,329
This is the wall
of the Medina in Fez.

519
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:50,199
I'll see you when you get back.

520
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:51,300
- You sure?

521
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:52,134
- I'm tired.

522
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:53,435
It wouldn't make sense.

523
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:55,070
This may be our last chance to go.

524
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:57,439
I know, but I'd rather stay here.

525
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:58,674
What do you want me to tell them?

526
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,910
That I'm not feeling well
and need to sleep.

527
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:02,378
I wouldn't be good company.
