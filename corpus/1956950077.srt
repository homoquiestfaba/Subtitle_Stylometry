- I'm gonna make some snack.

22
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:57,192
- I think I'm getting a
rash from these boxes.

23
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:07,883
Are you ready for your
epic journey to New York?

24
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:08,716
Yes!

25
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:19,623
- I'm not eating bread.

26
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,170
Since when?

27
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,511
- Since I want a flat belly for auditions.

28
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:29,226
New York's not gonna put
up with Midwest butt.

29
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:32,636
- You look great, don't freak out.

30
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:33,679
Are you sure you don't want any?

31
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,187
It's your favorite, it's Trader Toe Jam.

32
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:36,437
- Can't do it.

33
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,281
Hey, who am I?

34
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:48,299
- I don't know.

35
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,382
How about now?

36
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:54,971
- Oh god no, don't, don't,
don't hug-massage me.

37
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:56,572
You're Carl, okay, you're Creepy Carl!

38
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:59,739
Got it.

39
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:14,860
- Those are yours, that's your pile.

40
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,608
- Hm, I have doubles.

41
00:03:19,963 --> 00:03:23,334
I actually went to a
drugstore and had copies made.

42
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,167
- Wow, I,

43
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:28,603
I have a whole bunch you
know, on my computer,

44
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,660
but I never think to print them.

45
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,121
- I know.

46
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:33,983
I'm gonna put a bunch of 'em on my fridge,

47
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:35,733
in my new apartment.

48
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:40,137
Speaking of which,

49
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:47,624
my new job called, and they
want me there in 2 weeks,

50
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:51,920
or they have to give it to someone else.

51
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:09,971
- I'll still take care
of the bills this month.

52
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:13,190
I'll even clean the oven.

53
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,107
- I'm going to work, I'm late.

54
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:49,250
Doors closing.

55
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,917
Last before doors close.

56
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:07,351
You look like shit.

57
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:09,961
- Thank you.

58
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:15,468
- It's Jamie, she's
leaving in two weeks now.

59
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:19,465
- I don't really see a point,
she doesn't like me like that.

60
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:20,755
- Okay, first of all,
you don't even know that

61
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,610
because my last girlfriend
said she had a crush on me

62
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,361
for like, months, before
we even hooked up.

63
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:28,868
- Renee.

64
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:36,498
- Jody, Renee was before
Jody and after Lisa.

65
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:38,823
- I liked Lisa, Lisa was funny.

66
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:40,573
- Yeah, she still is.

67
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm gonna have to hook you
up with some cool ladies.

68
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,254
Yeah, you
can try, I don't know.

69
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:47,827
- No I get it, I get it.

70
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:51,618
I fall in love with every girl I fuck too.

71
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,108
Cheer up!

72
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,191
What up dog?

73
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:58,657
Always with the down low, dang!

74
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:02,824
Seriously, you're gonna have
to stop hanging out with Jamie.

75
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:09,629
It's all right, I'm gonna
hook you up with some hotties!

76
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,781
♫ Too much time to think

77
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:23,231
♫ My future prospects stink

78
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,341

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,967

95
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,039
- Large soy chocolate steamer, for Chuck.

96
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:14,962
- Thanks.

97
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,540
Hey.

98
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,373
- Hi.

99
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:28,105
So Dawn said you used to do

100
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,950
stained glass in Madison?

101
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,927
- Yeah, that was a great gig.

102
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:35,236
I still do it, but most
of the studio I use now,

103
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:36,655
for my leather business.

104
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:40,640
- Leather jackets, custom chaps.

105
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,973
But uh, accessories are the big seller.

106
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:48,326
I sell like a dozen a week,
even more in July and August.

107
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:54,122
- Yeah, yeah I went there
last summer but umm,

108
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:56,382
a bee stung me on my lip
like the very first day,

109
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:59,708
so I was in my tent on
Benadryl like the whole time.

110
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,641
But I remember there
was a lot of good music

111
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,308
and um, corn bread.

112
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:07,408
- Your lips look just fine right now.

113
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,427
- Um, you're a smoker.

114
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:22,478
Yeah.

115
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,934
- I don't think this is gonna work out.

116
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,091
- Yeah, sure, I could eat.

117
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:52,450
I don't care what you did,
Sasha, it doesn't matter now.

118
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:56,861
- Line.

119
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,456
Sorry, Jess.

120
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:02,623
Let's just
break, reset scene, take ten.

121
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:07,848
- Hey.
- Hey.

122
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,048
Sounds good.

123
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:11,108
- Thanks, I wish you
could be here to see it.

124
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,408
Do you, really?

125
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:13,775
- No, I don't wish you
could be here to see it.

126
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:14,608
Yeah, 'cause you look like

127
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,625
you're totally checking out.
- Look at me.

128
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,548
Look at me.

129
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:20,030
- You look like a tapestry
that fell off the wall.

130
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,120
Looks terrible.

131
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,953
- I like this a little--

132
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:26,373
- Hey Jamie, thought you were in New York.

133
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:28,036
Brooklyn.

134
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:29,212
Ten days.

135
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,519
- Uh, oh.

136
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,706
- Can't believe you're
not off book yet, man.

137
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:35,911
- What do you mean, we're
not up for a few weeks.

138
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:37,657
- I was kidding.

139
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:40,339
- Oh, so what neighborhood
you gonna move to?

140
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,254
Uh, Ditmas Park.

141
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:47,322
- It's out past Park Slope.

142
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:48,648
- You're gonna love it.

143
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,428
I got a cousin there in
Williamsburg, she loves it.

144
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:54,735
She's a painter, she loves it.

145
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:00,156
- She's married.

146
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,377
- I have to pee.

147
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,578
- Yeah, I'll meet you
at the beach in an hour.

148
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:08,828
Okay.

149
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:15,763
- Um yeah, so don't forget
about me when you're all famous.

150
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:18,161
Send me a postcard from Broadway.

151
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:21,157
But don't worry, you don't
have to go to Broadway Street.

152
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:24,456
A regular postal service will be okay.

153
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:25,289
- Okay.

154
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:27,831
Ah, okay.

155
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:32,698
I'll see you around Carl.

156
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:33,531
- Okay.

157
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:46,691
♫ They think I got it made

158
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:50,108
♫ You think I got it all

159
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:54,197
♫ But it's not what you think

160
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:57,447
♫ Feeling pretty small

161
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:03,527
♫ Don't know what happens next

162
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:07,693
♫ I may not pass the test

163
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,816
♫ They say I got the stuff

164
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:15,141
♫ But what if it's not enough

165
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:18,693
♫ What if you're not enough

166
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:32,566
♫ I can't wait to get out of here

167
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,152
♫ I'm ready to explode here

168
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:37,624
♫ Can't shoot my load here

169
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:41,186
♫ Chicago ain't my kind of town

170
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:43,572
♫ Don't explode

171
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:46,176
♫ That'll get messy

172
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:47,844
♫ She's moving on

173
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:51,609
♫ But what about Jessie

174
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,674
♫ You're a big fish in a little pond

175
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:58,841
♫ There you're just another prawn

176
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,350
♫ New York is the place for me

177
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,107

178
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:10,684
♫ I will be a big star

179
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:13,462
♫ I can go far

180
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:17,861
♫ And you won't need a car

181
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,541
♫ New York will put me to the test

182
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,198
♫ But I am different than the rest

183
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:25,878

♫ New York will put me to the test

190
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:45,276

♫ She thinks she's better than the rest

193
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:10,563
- Thought you didn't
have time for me anymore.

194
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,980
I have ten minutes.

195
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,542
Take it off.

196
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,603
- Okay, you missed it.

197
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,655
I don't know why I wait for you.

198
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:18,822
Um, if you're not here in ten
minutes, I'm gonna take off.

199
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:03,796
- Oh god, don't, don't get sand on me.

200
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:10,334
You were supposed to be here
at sunset, I called you.

201
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,584
- I'm sorry, my phone died.

202
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:18,060
Didn't think you'd still be here.

203
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:20,774
Sorry Jess.

204
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,084
Hey.

205
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:27,070
Who am I?

206
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:30,103
Blah, blah blah blah blah.

207
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:32,176
Blah, blah, blah blah blah blah blah.

208
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,607
Blah, blah, blah blah blah, blah.

209
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:36,217
Blah, blah
- Close-talker.

210
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,641
- Yes, my name is Sean.

211
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,686
You will know what I had for lunch

212
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:42,861
whether you want to or not, blah.

213
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,833
- I can tell what you had
for dinner, that's for sure.

214
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,666
- Uh-huh.

215
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:04,847
- Let's go skinny-dipping.

216
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:05,745
- It's not warm enough.

217
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:08,453
- Come on, just come in up to here.

218
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:11,189
- The last time I went in
there I got a yeast infection.

219
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:14,856
- That's not why you
got a yeast infection.

220
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,957
Come on, pretty soon I
won't be here to swim with.

221
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,049
- It's too cold.

222
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,186
- Pussy.

223
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:28,019
- Yeah, that's right.

224
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:42,364
♫ And if I say hello again
let it be for the last time

225
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:49,630
You know I think
this may be the only table

226
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,988
that will fit in my apartment.

227
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:53,168
- Sounds about right.

228
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:54,001
- Thanks.

229
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,430
Crap!

230
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,850
What?

231
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,933
- It broke off in there.

232
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:08,129
Screw it, I owe you a foot rub.

233
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,348
This is your last chance to claim it.

234
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:14,181
Let's go.

235
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:20,336
(light acoustic guitar
music in background)

236
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:30,611
♫ And if I say I love again
let it be for the last time

237
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:36,811
♫ And if break my bones again
let it be for the last time

238
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:42,166
- I still need to sort
through the bathroom stuff.

239
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,999
- Yeah, I can help you with that.

240
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:52,360
- Need to rent the truck,

241
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:56,638
do laundry, wrap dishes.

242
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:12,832
I'm kind of afraid of New York.

243
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:21,196
♫ Let's be happy

244
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:28,764
♫ All day and night

245
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:36,878
♫ I don't, know I won't, pretend it

246
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,430
♫ Let's be happy

247
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:01,877
- Hey.

248
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:03,127
Heyo.

249
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:10,886
- I don't really think they
were looking for girls like me.

250
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:13,934
It was a bunch of models there.

251
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,434
- That's a shame.

252
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:21,696
Foxy Oxy works too, got the
blood out of my frisbee shorts.

253
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:22,653
- Yeah, I was the one who rubbed that

254
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:23,890
on your frisbee shorts.

255
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,807
- Hey, I did your MichFest towels.

256
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,157
- Yeah, you probably should
have burned those.

257
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,141
- Your show's gonna come on.

258
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:38,799
Glenn Dreck.

259
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:42,747
- Scary.

260
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:49,375
- No, thank god, I need
a night to be depressed.

261
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:56,293
Hey, you wanna make frames for these?

262
00:21:58,388 --> 00:21:59,221
- Okay.

263
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,331
Okay, no more.

264
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,164
- Okay.

265
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:29,743
Business
values or labor values,

266
00:22:29,743 --> 00:22:31,826
they're American values.

267
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,827
- Let's go to Homo Depot, for the frames.

268
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:42,878
We'll get wood.

269
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:45,740
- Yeah.

270
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:51,142
- So shoes.

271
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:54,101
- Okay.

272
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,333
- And jacket.

273
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:10,527
- Hey Jamie.

274
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:11,360
Um-hm.

275
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:13,026
What?

276
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:14,359
- Chicken butt.

277
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,102
Nerd.

278
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,553
- Ow!

279
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,116
♫ I cannot breathe I cannot sleep

280
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:39,466
♫ I meditate while counting sheep

281
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:43,633
♫ Every now and then I think of you

282
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:50,289
♫ You are the eye inside my storm

283
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:53,981
♫ If I were cold, you'd be my warm

284
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:58,148
♫ Every now and then I think of you

285
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:03,525
♫ If you could see me
the way that I see you

286
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:10,574
♫ Then everything would
be just how I want it to

287
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:19,429
♫ Until you do, I will think of you

288
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,395
- You know mom is already
planning her holiday in Manhattan.

289
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:27,949
She wants me to come with.

290
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:30,105
It's gonna be a girls weekend.

291
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:30,938
- Um-hm.

292
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:33,983
You know mom and dad came here twice

293
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:35,983
in the last three years?

294
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:39,895
It's New York she wants to see.

295
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,812
- Come on.

296
00:24:45,404 --> 00:24:48,646
So, who's Jessie's new roommate?

297
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:52,573
- This guy from school, gay guy, musician.

298
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:54,572
- Well he better be cool,
because I'm not giving up

299
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:57,966
my Thursday nights away from my kids.

300
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:04,377
- Well, yeah, I mean if that's okay.

301
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:07,929
I love Jess, she's--

302
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:10,574
- It's, it's fine.

303
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:17,966
- This has got to be really hard for you.

304
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,659
I mean you guys talk like every day.

305
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,972
- It's not like we're not gonna talk.

306
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,107
When is she
planning on coming to see you?

307
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,357
- I don't know.

308
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:31,276
We haven't worked that out yet.

309
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,352
Hey, I have something for you.

310
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:52,004
I bought you this two years
ago in a thrift store.

311
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:54,671
- Hm, it's gorgeous, I love it.

312
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:01,078
Although I don't know if
I've really been a size six

313
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,599
since before the baby.

314
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,537
- Don't say that until you try it on.

315
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:06,450
- Ohh, my little sister!

316
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,830
- Ow, ow, all right, geez.

317
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,518
- I'm really proud of you, you know.

318
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:13,825
What?

319
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:17,838
- Just, don't be too
disappointed when I flop.

320
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:19,327
- That's the thing, babe,
even when you do flop

321
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,041
you still keep going anyways.

322
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,298
I know.

323
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:24,923
- Oh by the way, if you
don't sell everything

324
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:27,973
in the yard sale, dad's planning
on giving you some money

325
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:30,056
so don't worry about it.

326
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,637
Hey, when's this from?

327
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:38,091
- That's last summer.

328
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,993
It's a great
picture of you two.

329
00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:45,955
It's a copy, we have the originals.

330
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:47,987
- Sure, I'll put it on my fridge.

331
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:50,872
Oh shit, the spaghetti!

332
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,958
Oh fuck, it's all mushy now.

333
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,708
Lemme see.

334
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:04,439
- I guess it's just been one
of those really lucky years

335
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,459
for me, you know?

336
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,383
You ever have one of those?

337
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,824
- Well now that Mercury
is out of retrograde

338
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:16,585
and Jupiter's aligned
with Mars, I mean come on.

339
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:18,585
Let's go for it, right?

340
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:21,029
- Right.

341
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,414
- And then when Dawn said
that she had somebody

342
00:27:24,414 --> 00:27:27,337
she wanted me to meet that,

343
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:31,071
I might really like, , I um,

344
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:35,238
pulled out the calendar
and whoa, it was Flag Day.

345
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,470
It's about being proud of who you are.

346
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,769
- Proud of your country,
sure, but, you know,

347
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:46,029
standing up for yourself and saying yes.

348
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:49,279
I want love, I want freedom, you know?

349
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:53,218
- Just noticed your tattoo.

350
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:54,978
It's pretty awesome.

351
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:57,339
Miss Pac Man, I've never seen that before.

352
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,685
No, it's not Miss Pac Man.

353
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:00,649
- Oh.

354
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:04,554
- Um, it's an ancient symbol of a fish.

355
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:05,392
- Oh.

356
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,559
- Mm-hm, it uh means time before time.

357
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:11,775
Love before hate.

358
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,828
Something like that.

359
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:16,061
- Sounds about right.

360
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,836
- I should probably just tell you now

361
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:20,553
what eventually is gonna come up later.

362
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,459
- Um, well, we're not allowed
to talk about it in my family.

363
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,292
But,

364
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:33,025
my Grandpa was in the Nazi youth.

365
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:39,562
- Uh, oh, okay.

366
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:43,127
- He wasn't in it for very
long, only a couple years,

367
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:45,544
and then he moved to France.

368
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:51,081
- I, I don't really know what to say, um.

369
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:55,893
I'm feeling kind of nauseous
and my stomach is just like--

370
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,927
Something else we'd have in common.

371
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:06,118
I just didn't want any
secrets between us, you know?

372
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,231
- I have to go home.

373
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:09,064
Um.
- Okay.

374
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,882
- I need uh, I need to make
some watermelon slices.

375
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:15,903
- Oh, okay, take your time, I mean,

376
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:20,047
I really do think we could
have some fun though.

377
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:21,464
- See you later.

378
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:33,415
- Um-hm, it'll be a lot of
fun just to spend the day

379
00:29:33,415 --> 00:29:34,248
out in nature.

380
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:35,868
- Right.

381
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:36,775
- Hey.

382
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,003
- Jessica!

383
00:29:38,003 --> 00:29:39,071
- Hey.

384
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:40,988
- Hi!

385
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:44,674
- Uh.

386
00:29:44,674 --> 00:29:46,148
- There's extra pasta if you want some.

387
00:29:46,148 --> 00:29:48,063
- Oh no thanks, I'm not hungry.

388
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,935
- Hey Jess, Jamie said it's still cool

389
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:52,539
for me to come over after she moves.

390
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:54,800
- Awesome, Spaghetti Thursdays.

391
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,633
Mm-hm.

392
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:59,665
Did you kiss her?

393
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,835
- I've already tried to blank it out.

394
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:03,035
Oh, I didn't realize you were

395
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,108
dating other people already Jess.

396
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:11,027
- I'm really super tired, I'm gonna.

397
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:15,254
- Hey Jess, I'm planning
on coming to see your play.

398
00:30:15,254 --> 00:30:16,913
Can you tell me when is it again?

399
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:17,831
- It's next month.

400
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:22,548
- I will, uh, have a good night, bye.

401
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,254
- Night.

402
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:37,429
What's going on?

403
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:42,297
- She had a bad day,
she wants to go to bed.

404
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:56,075
- I don't get it.

405
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,483
♫ Far away I lie to myself

406
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:12,191
♫ For a change I lie to myself

407
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,776
- Okay, what's the first
thing you're gonna do

408
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:46,404
when you move to New York?

409
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,814
- Hm, buy tampons, I start
my period on the 15th.

410
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:51,315
- Mm, so do I.

411
00:31:51,315 --> 00:31:52,195
- I know.

412
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:58,166
- Um, I'm gonna buy a
slice of sausage pizza

413
00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:01,860
and walk everywhere.

414
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:04,137
- Do you have to start
your job right away?

415
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:04,970
- Mm-hm.

416
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,803
- Mm.

417
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:07,607
- She's got two auditions
lined up already.

418
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,618
Really, for plays?

419
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:11,935
- One is for Candyland, the play.

420
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:17,168
- Um-hm, I'd play Princess Lolly.

421
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,642
- Mm, you were born to
play Princess Lolly.

422
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:23,475
- Yeah, I'd want to play her too.

423
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:30,303
- She's moving after
this last year of school.

424
00:32:30,303 --> 00:32:32,095
- Which is a long way away.

425
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,512
- Two semesters.

426
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:38,125
Hey, let's split another beer.

427
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,875
- Ah, if you insist.

428
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:47,363
So how was your date with
the dental hygienist?

429
00:32:47,363 --> 00:32:48,625
- Kind of like getting your teeth pulled

430
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,254
but without the nitrous.

431
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:52,833
- Thank God I'm with Sarah.

432
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:56,134
I don't even know what
it's like to date anymore.

433
00:32:56,134 --> 00:33:00,301
- Yeah, I don't know if I've
ever really dated anyone.

434
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:08,485
It's just hard to find the
kind of girl I like in Chicago.

435
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,157
- Yeah, especially since she's going to be

436
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:12,157
in New York in a minute.

437
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:17,150
Only have to
get me another drink.

438
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,317
Hey!

439
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:22,477
Hey, how's it goin'?

440
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,767
- Hey, glad you made it.

441
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:28,662
I already got your drinks.

442
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:30,437
- Oh, thanks.
- Thank you, awesome.

443
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:31,697
That's why I love you.

444
00:33:31,697 --> 00:33:33,420
- Good turn out tonight.

445
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,253
- Think you'll have time to squeeze in

446
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:36,336
another one

447
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:41,245
- Here, I've got to go to the potty.

448
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:43,025
- I swear she has a bladder infection.

449
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:45,507
- She drinks too much
water, not enough wine.

450
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:49,601
- Is that why she has anxiety
attacks every other week?

451
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:53,172
- Oh my god, this person, I'm knocking.

452
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,595
Hey, is this the end of the--

453
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:00,428
- Yeah.

454
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:05,315
God I hope they play some
decent music this time.

455
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:07,022
- Yeah, it was really
shitty last week, wasn't it?

456
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:10,718
- I wish they'd play
something, you know, funky.

457
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:13,718
- Yeah, 'cause I uh, like it funky.

458
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:18,557
- Cool.

459
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:21,729
- And I like your T-shirt.

460
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:26,650
- Thanks, I have trouble with real ties.

461
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,483
- Yeah.

462
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:30,420
Ah, go ahead, you can take mine.

463
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,347
Are you sure?

464
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:32,180
- Yeah.

465
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,525
- Thank you.

466
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,525
- If you dance with me.

467
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,763
- Yeah, all right.

468
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,703
- To Jamie, and her Big Apples.

469
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:50,018
- I do love big apples.

470
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:55,487

471

- Um, do you mind if we
move over to the rocks?

501
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,991
I'm allergic to grass.

502
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:24,824
- Sure.

503
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,614
That must be a drag.

504
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:46,837
- A friend of mine is
allergic to wheat and corn,

505
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,509
plus he can't drink wine.

506

- That'd be horrible.

507

Hey James, Jamie?

525
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,720
What?

526
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,522
- Can't wear that.

527
00:39:57,115 --> 00:39:59,431
- Crap, I can't wear my lucky shirt then.

528
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:00,278
Yeah.

529
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:01,111
Well, you can't wear that one,

530
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:04,242
they'll smell you a mile anyway.

531
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:05,075
- I know.

532
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:08,652
Ow!
- Oh!

533
00:40:08,652 --> 00:40:09,932
I'm really nervous.

534
00:40:09,932 --> 00:40:12,765
- You're gonna be great, come on.

535
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:20,241
You've run it a million
times, you know your lines.

536
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:22,888
The play's about being in
love, you've been in love.

537
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,138
So, just connect with that.

538
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,320
Go in, say your lines right,

539
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,100
you'll knock 'em out of the park.

540
00:40:35,078 --> 00:40:38,013
- It won't take long, I, I uh,

541
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:39,929
it'll just help me focus,
run lines, you know?

542
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:40,762
- Mmm.

543
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:45,754
- Fine.

544
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:48,635
Only if we get to go skinny-dipping after.

545
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:50,569
- Yeah sure cool, whatever,
let's just go I'm late.

546
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:53,050
Whoo!

547
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,879
And then
the sun started to sink

548
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,969
just like the coward it was.

549
00:40:56,969 --> 00:40:58,898
You were the last one to see it,

550
00:40:58,898 --> 00:41:01,632
but I was the last one who cared.

551
00:41:01,632 --> 00:41:02,549
And, scene.

552
00:41:03,965 --> 00:41:05,132
Thanks again.

553
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:08,932
Next?

554
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:09,765
- Hello.

555
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:15,180
- Hey, just do what you
do, I'll be over here.

556
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,740
- Oh, Jamie!

557
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,740
- Oh!
Hey Hi!

558
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:27,402
Are you auditioning for this?

559
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,787
- No, I'm just waitin' for Jess.

560
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:32,287
- Oh, she'd be wonderful in this, I think.

561
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:36,337
Hey, anything lined up in New York?

562
00:41:36,337 --> 00:41:37,813
You know, it's always good
to get a few auditions

563
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:40,600
in your calendar before you get there.

564
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,844
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

565
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:43,779
- Well, keep me informed.

566
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:45,911
I know some people you should meet.

567
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:47,661
- I will, thank you.

568
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,943
- You know, you should
just audition for this,

569
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,194
now that you're already here.

570
00:41:52,194 --> 00:41:54,284
I mean, it's good practice.

571
00:41:54,284 --> 00:41:57,044
- I-I'm not gonna be
in town for it though.

572
00:41:57,044 --> 00:41:59,576
- So much the better, it
won't matter that much.

573
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:00,680
I'll get ya in next.

574
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,704
- I, I don't want to cut in line.

575
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:04,037
- Hey, come on.

576
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:14,506
- Oh, hey, I'll be out in 10 minutes.

577
00:42:28,866 --> 00:42:30,939
Jess, she pushed,
she pushed me in there.

578
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:32,455
Whatever.

579
00:42:32,455 --> 00:42:34,142
Helen said to
audition for practice.

580
00:42:34,142 --> 00:42:35,476
It's not like I'm gonna,

581
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:37,462
I don't even want the role.

582
00:42:37,462 --> 00:42:39,890
Okay, it's harmless.

583
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,584
- I don't really feel like swimming.

584
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,667
- Hello, this is Jamie.

585
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:49,627
Hi, yeah.

586
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:56,049
Oh, thank you, but um, I
don't think I can take it.

587
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:02,661
Yeah, Helen told you right?

588
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:06,279
Yeah, huh, I really can't take it.

589
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,717
I've got some stuff lined
up in New York already,

590
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:10,384
but umm, thank you.

591
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:13,541
Yeah, you too.

592
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:15,434
Bye.

593
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:37,544
- Hello.

594
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:39,780
Oh hi.

595
00:43:41,979 --> 00:43:42,812
Really?

596
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:45,370
Yes, yeah, I,

597
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:48,863
yes, I, I, I, I really love this role,

598
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:51,613
I really want, love this play I,

599
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:53,921
Okay.

600
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:59,221
Okay, okay, well, thank you so much.

601
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:00,471
Okay, uh, bye.

602
00:44:06,304 --> 00:44:08,548
- Yeah, I got it.

603
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:10,548
- That's awesome, Jess.

604
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:15,264
You knew how much
this meant to me, Jamie.

605
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:18,189
Yeah, that's
why I didn't take it.

606
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:21,473
- So what, now I know
I'm their second choice.

607
00:44:21,473 --> 00:44:23,186
Why did you even try out?

608
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:24,222
- Helen pushed me in there.

609
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:25,075
- Don't blame Helen!

610
00:44:25,075 --> 00:44:26,391
You are so fucking selfish!
- I'm sorry,

611
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:28,641
what do you want me to do?

612
00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:31,918
- You just do this all the time.

613
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,796
- You wouldn't even have been
there if I hadn't asked you

614
00:44:35,796 --> 00:44:37,713
to come and support me.

615
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:42,385
You just, everything just
comes so fucking easy for you.

616
00:44:42,385 --> 00:44:44,431
Jess, Jess.

617
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,931
Go, go hump a camel!

618
00:44:54,062 --> 00:44:55,645
Damn it.

619
00:45:12,932 --> 00:45:15,553
Hey, do you need help?

620
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:18,053
- Yeah, someone took my wheel.

621
00:45:20,088 --> 00:45:21,851
People suck, who does that?

622
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:22,838
It's raining.

623
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:31,131
Sorry,  do you need help?

624
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:33,535
- No, I walked today.

625
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:35,798
Can you leave it here and
then just come back for it?

626
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:39,083
- I don't want them to
take the rest of it.

627
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,294
I'm going about two miles that way.

628
00:45:41,294 --> 00:45:42,452
- Well, I'll go with you.

629
00:45:42,452 --> 00:45:44,989
I was going to Andersonville
anyway, we'll take turns.

630
00:45:45,924 --> 00:45:47,347
- Yeah, come on.

631
00:45:51,936 --> 00:45:52,772
My god.

632
00:45:52,772 --> 00:45:53,688
What?

633
00:45:53,688 --> 00:45:56,411
Bad day.

634
00:45:56,411 --> 00:45:57,359
It's kind of like a wheelbarrow--

635
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,544
- I know.
- you have to angle it.

636
00:45:59,544 --> 00:46:01,294
There, okay, got it.

637
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:07,217
- That must be kind of great,
getting to be on the stage,

638
00:46:07,217 --> 00:46:09,136
you know, to be someone else.

639
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:11,970
Yeah, but I'm
always me, you know?

640
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,529
Like no matter who I play.

641
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:17,904
Sometimes I wish I could just
totally become someone else,

642
00:46:17,904 --> 00:46:19,547
you know, and have their voice.

643
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:20,926
Oh yeah, like Meryl Streep.

644
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:25,673
- No, no, no, no, no, I
mean, I could never be her.

645
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:29,104
Like, like scientific stuff, you know?

646
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:31,995
Like, instead of having lines from,

647
00:46:31,995 --> 00:46:35,482
from Mamet or Wasserstein, I
could be thinking about like,

648
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:37,202
microbes and protons.

649
00:46:37,202 --> 00:46:38,964
Do you want me to switch?

650
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:42,464
- Well, yeah, here I'm gonna put it down.

651
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:45,067
Go for it.

652
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:47,172
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:50,253
Yeah, here, done.

654
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:53,479
- Oh god, here, thank you.

655
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:58,401
Well, you know, you don't have
to be good at just one thing.

656
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:02,198
- You're right, I could
fail equally at many things.

657
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:06,550
- Seriously, I couldn't do what you do.

658
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:11,253
- Yeah, you kind of keep us sane.

659
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:13,602
You're basically a mental health worker.

660
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:20,100
- Um, well, I, believe it or not,

661
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,652
I used to want to write mystery novels.

662
00:47:22,652 --> 00:47:26,972
And then I went into my
family's snack business.

663
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,280
Come on.

664
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:34,199
- Little Bobbie.

665
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:38,460
Oh my god are you for
serious, I love Little Bobbie!

666
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,892
With the, the, let me get that.

667
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:44,551
With the, with the, with
the, with the swirly thingies

668
00:47:44,551 --> 00:47:48,134
and the the caramel star, um, cake things?

669
00:47:50,094 --> 00:47:51,369
- Yep.

670
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,605
- That's hot.

671
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:55,645
- Yeah, well I hated it.

672
00:47:55,645 --> 00:47:59,515
And then I didn't really
like being around my family,

673
00:47:59,515 --> 00:48:01,735
so I went into computer engineering.

674
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:02,568
- Aa-ah.

675
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:08,578
Do you have a lot of bad lighting there?

676
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:09,733
Is that the
one with the talking dog

677
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:11,065
and the old guy baby?

678
00:48:11,065 --> 00:48:12,128
Yeah.

679
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:14,531
It's like there's all these shows with

680
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:16,938
old fat dads, you know?

681
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:18,227
- Well, that's why they
need the talking dog

682
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:20,019
and the old guy baby.

683
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:24,103
- Well maybe you can
explain it to me sometime.

684
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:25,186
- This is me.

685
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:32,447
Thanks again for helping
me take that home.

686
00:48:32,447 --> 00:48:33,614
- Yeah, sure.

687
00:48:34,898 --> 00:48:36,059
You know, I have a little sailboat

688
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:37,735
I'm taking out this weekend.

689
00:48:37,735 --> 00:48:39,985
Do you maybe want to join me?

690
00:48:41,257 --> 00:48:42,090
- Yeah.

691
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:46,194
- Um, I don't know, my, my
roommate is moving and I'm help--

692
00:48:46,194 --> 00:48:48,944
- Well, here, give me your hand.

693
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:52,132
Why don't you, let me know.

694
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:54,965
- Okay.

695
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:00,721
What's up?

696
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:02,490
- Someone stole my wheel.

697
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,240
- Bummer, I'm Jamie.

698
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,292
- Hi, I'm Elizabeth.

699
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,571
It's nice to meet you.

700
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:17,517
It's really nice to meet you too, Jessie.

701
00:49:17,517 --> 00:49:18,937
Bye.

702
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:20,029
Oh, sorry.

703
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:21,512
- Oh, thanks.

704
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:22,345
- Bye.

705
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:29,356
- She's hot.

706
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:32,809
She live around here?

707
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:06,709
Dunno, have to work.

708
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:08,469
- Well call in sick, I'll
pay your wages for the day.

709
00:50:08,469 --> 00:50:10,018
For the week how bout?

710
00:50:10,018 --> 00:50:11,518
- Don't be weird.

711
00:50:16,585 --> 00:50:18,118
What're you doin'?

712
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:19,270
- I was gonna send you this,

713
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,020
but you may as well have it now.

714
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,984
I feel like a hooker.

715
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:34,676
- You're my friend, moving
to an expensive city.

716
00:50:34,676 --> 00:50:37,984
Come on, this is easy for me.

717
00:50:37,984 --> 00:50:39,739
- That's like a month's rent.

718
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:43,322
- It's what I make in a day, just take it.

719
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:52,844
You're gonna miss me.

720
00:50:52,844 --> 00:50:54,509
- Don't rub it in.

721
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,926
- That's not what you said a minute ago.

722
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:03,132
- I wish I could take you with me.

723
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:05,799
And Jessie, and Katrina, George,

724
00:51:07,078 --> 00:51:09,078
my sister, and the lake.

725
00:51:10,707 --> 00:51:12,711
- And your women.

726
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:14,884
You've got the best of both worlds.

727
00:51:14,884 --> 00:51:16,947
What worlds?

728
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:18,611
- Well, you have booty
calls whenever you want them

729
00:51:18,611 --> 00:51:20,450
and you have the wife at home,

730
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,784
cooking, cleaning, and doing your laundry.

731
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:24,334
- We share the laundry.

732
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:26,463
- So you're the only
one who hasn't noticed?

733
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:29,463
- How Jess looks at you.

734
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:30,978
Like what?

735
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:32,249
- Like so.

736
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:33,161
Ohh.

737
00:51:33,161 --> 00:51:35,661
- Oh, that looks good on you.

738
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:41,893
- Whatever, it's good you're leaving.

739
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:46,425
I don't know how much
more of this I could take.

740
00:51:48,854 --> 00:51:51,271
- You're not exactly single.

741
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:56,978
I'm sorry, I guess I'm just jealous.

742
00:51:56,978 --> 00:51:59,895
- You didn't get jealous you said.

743
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:03,589
- Everybody gets jealous.

744
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:08,071
It's just a matter of time.

745
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:12,632
Now get outta here.

746
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,497
♫ Hurry up and leave my love

747
00:52:38,497 --> 00:52:41,330
♫ Hurry up and go

748
00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:47,466
♫ The first time that I touched you

749
00:52:48,323 --> 00:52:52,398
♫ I didn't even know your name

750
00:52:52,398 --> 00:52:56,065
♫ Now I can hardly stand it

751
00:52:57,562 --> 00:53:01,062
♫ Got beat at my own game

752
00:53:03,282 --> 00:53:07,692
♫ Hurry up and leave my love

753
00:53:07,692 --> 00:53:11,192
♫ It's time for you to go

754
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:16,511
♫ Hurry up and leave my love

755
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:20,539
♫ Hurry up and go

756
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:24,974
♫ I thought that I was

757
00:53:24,974 --> 00:53:27,569
♫ Tough and strong

758
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:31,069
♫ Would never wear a ring

759
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:34,320
♫ Our one night stand

760
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,168
♫ Went on too long

761
00:53:37,168 --> 00:53:41,844
♫ It became a three month fling

762
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:45,344
♫ And now the die is cast

763
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:51,082
♫ I'm just a story in your past

764
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:54,415
♫ I'm already wondering

765
00:53:55,883 --> 00:53:59,716
♫ Which kiss will be our last

766
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:14,721
Hey.

767
00:54:14,721 --> 00:54:15,888
Hey.

768
00:54:20,931 --> 00:54:23,212
- You should press
through your hands more,

769
00:54:23,212 --> 00:54:25,777
straighten your back.

770
00:54:25,777 --> 00:54:29,360
I don't need your advice, thanks.

771
00:54:33,805 --> 00:54:36,539
- Actually, um, could
you just leave me alone

772
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,150
for a few minutes, I'm trying to relax.

773
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:40,983
- Yeah.

774
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:48,504
Oh, just real quick, 'cause
you never called me back.

775
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:53,706
Um, are we still doing something tomorrow?

776
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:59,240
- Um, I can't, I, I have
a date with Elizabeth.

777
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,573
We're going sailing, she has a, a boat.

778
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:04,287
- Cool.

779
00:55:06,716 --> 00:55:10,466
We always said we needed
friends with boats.

780
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:17,391
You're still helping me
with the yard sale, right?

781
00:55:17,391 --> 00:55:19,498
- Yeah, I said that I would.

782
00:55:19,498 --> 00:55:22,625
- And um, we need to go
grocery shopping for the party.

783
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:26,708
- Yeah, okay, can we just
talk about this later?

784
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:48,766
♫ Why don't you tell her

785
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:52,553
♫ You waited all your life to tell her

786
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:56,720
♫ Come on you know you wanna
tell her what she means to you

787
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:03,751
♫ It's a cynical life and
you're not a simple girl

788
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:06,675
♫ You drink a bottle of wine every night

789
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:09,904
♫ And you prefer to
keep a mask on your face

790
00:56:09,904 --> 00:56:14,071
♫ You're playin' it safe under the covers

791
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:19,752
♫ You're losin' your faith
in the mantra that you live

792
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:24,099
♫ It's sayin' that you gotta
love the one you're with

793
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:28,266
♫ If you can't be with the one you love

794
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,853
- No thanks.

795
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:55,331
- Five days.

796
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:56,890
Jessica going too I assume?

797
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,025
- Nah, she's got a year left of school.

798
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:07,282
- Uh no, actually we're not
together, we're just friends.

799
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:09,032
Oh, oh.

800
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:13,126
How much is this?

801
00:57:13,126 --> 00:57:17,043
- Um, I don't know,
actually, that's Jessie's.

802
00:57:18,246 --> 00:57:19,079
She made it?

803
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:20,144
- Yeah.
- It's great.

804
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:23,975
- Yeah, she should have
been here by now, actually.

805
00:57:23,975 --> 00:57:26,829
I'll give
her five bucks for it.

806
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:28,564
- How about I set it aside for you,

807
00:57:28,564 --> 00:57:30,859
and when she gets here I'll
let her know you want it.

808
00:57:30,859 --> 00:57:31,766
That sound good?

809
00:57:31,766 --> 00:57:32,599
Yeah.

810
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:33,957
- Good.

811
00:57:33,957 --> 00:57:35,375
- Good luck.

812
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,208
- Thanks.

813
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:55,838
Uh--

814
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:57,734
- Come on in, come on in, you
don't have to stand out there.

815
00:57:57,734 --> 00:57:58,844
- Thanks, sorry.

816
00:57:58,844 --> 00:58:02,327
Ah, Jamie said that she left
a hoodie of mine over here?

817
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:05,457
It's a black, it's kinda long, have you?

818
00:58:05,457 --> 00:58:07,765
- Oh, I haven't seen it but
you're welcome to come in

819
00:58:07,765 --> 00:58:08,712
and look around if you want.

820
00:58:08,712 --> 00:58:11,214
- Cool, cool yeah, thank you.

821
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:13,648
Oh.

822
00:58:16,803 --> 00:58:17,736
Wow.

823
00:58:19,224 --> 00:58:21,282
- You have a lot of cameras.

824
00:58:21,282 --> 00:58:24,495
- Oh, yeah, well I started
collecting them when I was a kid.

825
00:58:24,495 --> 00:58:25,328
- Cool.

826
00:58:25,328 --> 00:58:27,495
- This one's my favorite.

827
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:30,756
Why?

828
00:58:30,756 --> 00:58:32,551
- It was one my dad gave me.

829
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,953
You know why they call it Kodak?

830
00:58:34,786 --> 00:58:37,362
- 'Cause when you press the
button it makes that sound.

831
00:58:37,362 --> 00:58:38,529
Kodak, Kodak.

832
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:44,036
- Yeah, yeah, it sounds
like when you say it.

833
00:58:44,036 --> 00:58:45,864
My Mom had a camera when
I was, when I was little,

834
00:58:45,864 --> 00:58:47,996
and it would like talk at
you and it would say like,

835
00:58:47,996 --> 00:58:50,556
too dark, too dark, when it was too dark.

836
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:53,233
But it wasn't clicking
it was an automated,

837
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:55,400
you know, accented, yeah.

838
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,186
- You're a lot funnier than Jamie is.

839
00:58:59,186 --> 00:59:00,019
- Thanks.

840
00:59:02,577 --> 00:59:04,874
I'm, I'm sorry, am I
interrupting something?

841
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,783
- No, no no, I was just having
a drink, do you want one?

842
00:59:07,783 --> 00:59:08,616
- Sure.

843
00:59:08,616 --> 00:59:09,449
- All right.

844
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:10,616
- Yeah, yeah.

845
00:59:13,422 --> 00:59:15,405
- Yeah that's, whiskey's fantastic.

846
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:16,988
Awesome.

847
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,369
- Thank you.

848
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:28,068
- You're welcome.

849
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:30,835
Oh, you don't need to chug
it, you can just sip it.

850
00:59:30,835 --> 00:59:31,835
- Oh, okay.

851
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,002
- Cheers.

852
00:59:35,002 --> 00:59:36,419
- Cheers, sorry.

853
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:41,987
- Uh huh, I think I need a little more.

854
00:59:42,936 --> 00:59:44,765
- Yeah, I'm, I'm fine, I just--

855
00:59:46,992 --> 00:59:49,023
- I just kinda wanna get
my hoodie back, you know?

856
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,564
- Yeah.

857
00:59:50,564 --> 00:59:52,408
- Jamie is always taking my stuff and--

858
00:59:52,408 --> 00:59:54,352
- Yeah, it's okay, I got it.

859
00:59:54,352 --> 00:59:55,396
Cool.

860
00:59:55,396 --> 00:59:59,146
- Sorry, I'm just weird
about the sweatshirt.

861
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:02,890
It's probably not even here.

862
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,639
You know, you just lend something to Jamie

863
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:06,737
and then you think you're
gonna get it back maybe

864
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:09,471
at some point, but then she
gives it to someone else

865
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:10,913
and then you see them wearing it

866
01:00:10,913 --> 01:00:13,867
and that's just, it's strange.

867
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:15,236
- Yeah, I have the same
problem with my jewelry.

868
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:19,605
She like takes it, doesn't
ask, never get it back.

869
01:00:19,605 --> 01:00:21,153
- You still have some on.

870
01:00:21,153 --> 01:00:24,013
- Oh this, well, I never take this off,

871
01:00:24,013 --> 01:00:25,693
so she'd basically have to like,

872
01:00:25,693 --> 01:00:28,226
take it off while I was sleeping.

873
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:29,742
Which would be creepy.

874
01:00:29,742 --> 01:00:32,372
- Yeah, oh yeah that
would be pretty creepy.

875
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:41,097
This is good.

876
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:42,862
- Yeah, I uh, I didn't make it

877
01:00:42,862 --> 01:00:45,076
so I can't take credit for
it but I, I poured it--

878
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:48,431
- I have, yeah.

879
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:52,495
In the wintertime.

880
01:00:52,495 --> 01:00:53,964
- That's intense.

881
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:55,923
- Yeah, it's fun.

882
01:00:55,923 --> 01:00:59,104
Tastes better when you
work for it, ya know?

883
01:00:59,104 --> 01:01:03,271
- Is that like the liquor
version of hunting or something?

884
01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:08,730
I never
thought about it that way.

885
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:10,147
You're so weird.

886
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,167
- Okay.

887
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:16,890
I feel like I should tell you something,

888
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:21,482
but I don't want this to
come off the wrong way she,

889
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:25,649
Jamie's not really good at
keeping in touch with people.

890
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:27,708
You know?

891
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,032
Why are you telling me that?

892
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:34,199
- I mean, I don't know, just,
thought you should know.

893
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:37,241
- Are you talking about like
when she goes to New York?

894
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:39,828
Like whether she's gonna call me or not?

895
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:41,233
- I mean, I don't know
what she's gonna do,

896
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:43,680
I'm not saying that.

897
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,827
- I mean it doesn't
really matter, we don't,

898
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:46,835
it's not like we've made any promises

899
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:48,717
to each other or anything.

900
01:01:48,717 --> 01:01:49,579
- Okay.

901
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:50,412
- Yeah.

902
01:01:51,902 --> 01:01:53,123
You worried about that?

903
01:01:53,123 --> 01:01:53,956
- Mm-Uh.

904
01:01:57,073 --> 01:01:58,991
Yes you are.

905
01:01:58,991 --> 01:02:00,241
- No, I'm not.

906
01:02:01,578 --> 01:02:04,495
You like her don't you?

907
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:06,425
- No.

908
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:11,079
- Yeah you do, you like her a lot.

909
01:02:13,222 --> 01:02:14,829
- You need to shut up.

910
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:21,658
- You definitely don't
like me very much, do you?

911
01:02:28,134 --> 01:02:29,641
- I'm done.

912
01:02:30,844 --> 01:02:32,344
It's a camera.

913
01:02:32,344 --> 01:02:33,962
See, Kodak, Kodak.

914
01:02:34,795 --> 01:02:36,462
- You are so weird.

915
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,147
- Um, the glasses.

916
01:02:49,147 --> 01:02:50,564
- Oh, I'm sorry.

917
01:02:52,865 --> 01:02:54,222
- Oh, we don't have to stop.

918
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,647
This is awkward.

919
01:03:02,647 --> 01:03:05,647
♫ I could come down

920
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,132
♫ To your love

921
01:03:10,611 --> 01:03:14,778
♫ And I could live longer than you thought

922
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:23,225
♫ And then you'd never have to leave me

923
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:30,952
♫ And you would never have to deceive me

924
01:03:34,518 --> 01:03:37,768
♫ Oh I could come down

925
01:03:50,685 --> 01:03:53,993
♫ I went to your show

926
01:03:53,993 --> 01:03:56,993
♫ To see the actors

927
01:03:58,237 --> 01:04:01,946
♫ Though I'll never know

928
01:04:01,946 --> 01:04:05,196
♫ How much they suffer

929
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:11,258
♫ 'Cause it's only shining stars

930
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:19,134
♫ On stage with bleeding hearts

931
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:27,514
- All right,

932
01:04:30,556 --> 01:04:32,973
here you go, have a good one.

933
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:46,893
- I just put Judith Butler
in the kids' section.

934
01:04:46,893 --> 01:04:48,551
I am freaking out.

935
01:04:50,711 --> 01:04:52,374
- Oh it's like

936
01:04:52,374 --> 01:04:54,207
Jess is acting weird.

937
01:04:57,507 --> 01:05:00,546
- Well, she blew me off at my yard sale,

938
01:05:00,546 --> 01:05:03,141
now she won't answer calls.

939
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:07,308
- It sounds like she's sad, not
mad, for you abandoning her.

940
01:05:08,181 --> 01:05:11,343
- I'm not abandoning her,
she's not my girlfriend.

941
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:13,233
- Ah, coulda fooled me.

942
01:05:13,233 --> 01:05:16,400
She acts like she's in love with you.

943
01:05:17,558 --> 01:05:18,453
- You know you're not the first person

944
01:05:18,453 --> 01:05:20,703
to tell me that this week?

945
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:24,398
- Oh, here she comes.

946
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:26,436
Hey.

947
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,100
- Thank you.

948
01:05:31,347 --> 01:05:33,724
Oh my god, falafel.

949
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:36,807
Thank you, I am so hungry right now.

950
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:42,018
Hey Jess, I need to talk to you.

951
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:46,297
- Um, I wanna talk to you
too, but I have to go to work.

952
01:05:46,297 --> 01:05:48,170
I'll see you at the party?

953
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,095
Bye Katrina.

954
01:05:49,095 --> 01:05:49,928
- Bye.

955
01:05:53,488 --> 01:05:56,535
She looks good walking away.

956
01:06:05,459 --> 01:06:06,292
- It's really sweet of you

957
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:08,539
throwing this party for Jamie, George.

958
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:11,195
- Going away parties are
so more important than

959
01:06:11,195 --> 01:06:14,671
birthdays or weddings, that's what I say.

960
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,448
- You know, I'm going to
be leaving too one day.

961
01:06:16,448 --> 01:06:18,198
- No, it's all right.

962
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:22,171
Here, cheese nib, aw, pop.

963
01:06:22,171 --> 01:06:23,728
- Mm, those things are good.

964
01:06:23,728 --> 01:06:26,529
- I know, it's right there, it's good.

965
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:28,192
Who's that sexy thing?

966
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:29,784
I haven't seen her before.

967
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:32,534
Hey, you might get lucky tonight.

968
01:06:33,725 --> 01:06:34,704
Hey.

969
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:35,537
Hey, how you doin'?

970
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:39,119
Ah, this is my sister.

971
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,314
- Hi, I'm Monica.

972
01:06:41,314 --> 01:06:42,578
- Hi, Rhonda, nice to meet you.

973
01:06:42,578 --> 01:06:43,898
- Nice to meet you.

974
01:06:43,898 --> 01:06:46,755
- Rhonda's a good friend.

975
01:06:46,755 --> 01:06:47,802
- Yeah.

976
01:06:47,802 --> 01:06:48,684
- Good.

977
01:06:48,684 --> 01:06:49,973
- Good.

978
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:52,140
I'm gonna go get a drink.

979
01:06:58,587 --> 01:06:59,420
Hey.

980
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:04,765
- I didn't know you were gonna be here.

981
01:07:04,765 --> 01:07:06,348
- Clock's ticking.

982
01:07:12,816 --> 01:07:14,566
- Have a cheese nib.

983
01:07:27,395 --> 01:07:28,844
- Everyone, everyone.

984
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,342
A toast.

985
01:07:31,342 --> 01:07:34,198
- Yes, okay, even though
you are my younger sister,

986
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:37,216
and a complete pain in the ass.

987
01:07:37,216 --> 01:07:40,780
And you narcked on me every
chance you could to dad,

988
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,430
I couldn't have asked for a better sister.

989
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,236
I'm proud of you, Jamie.

990
01:07:45,236 --> 01:07:47,648
- Here, here.
- Oh, okay,

991
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:49,692
okay, okay, okay.

992
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:51,920
The bookstore is gonna miss her,

993
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,132
and I'm gonna miss you
especially even more

994
01:07:54,132 --> 01:07:56,120
because I'm not gonna
be able to play D and D

995
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,231
all the time on the computer!

996
01:07:59,231 --> 01:08:03,690
But seriously, enjoy New
York, I'm gonna miss you.

997
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:04,523
- Cheers.

998
01:08:04,523 --> 01:08:05,356
- Cheers.

999
01:08:05,356 --> 01:08:06,189
To Jamie!

1000
01:08:06,189 --> 01:08:07,838
To Jamie!

1001
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:11,823
- My darling roommate, a
fabulously talented actress

1002
01:08:11,823 --> 01:08:14,323
and an even better fuck, huh?

1003
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:24,241
What?

1004
01:08:24,241 --> 01:08:25,658
I know you know.

1005
01:08:29,373 --> 01:08:32,898
You know Jamie, Chicago
is going to miss you, but

1006
01:08:32,898 --> 01:08:34,065
I'll survive.

1007
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:39,816
- Jess, you're drunk.

1008
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,339
Did you eat anything?

1009
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:42,344
You care?

1010
01:08:42,344 --> 01:08:44,039
- God, don't be so mean.

1011
01:08:45,515 --> 01:08:47,977
I'm the nice one, Jamie.

1012
01:08:47,977 --> 01:08:51,144
Who got you into that Improv
for Pinter class, huh?

1013
01:08:51,144 --> 01:08:52,832
And who helped you with
all your algebra tests,

1014
01:08:52,832 --> 01:08:55,862
negative plus negative
equals positive, Jamie.

1015
01:08:55,862 --> 01:08:57,486
- Yeah, that was you, Jess but--

1016
01:08:57,486 --> 01:08:59,314
- Yeah, and when you
had to sell your eggs,

1017
01:08:59,314 --> 01:09:01,686
who put all the hormone
shots in your butt?

1018
01:09:01,686 --> 01:09:03,421
And who got you lime popsicles every night

1019
01:09:03,421 --> 01:09:05,185
because you were feeling really shitty?

1020
01:09:05,185 --> 01:09:08,102
Those were made out of real limes.

1021
01:09:09,739 --> 01:09:11,466
- Thanks a lot, I'm leaving.

1022
01:09:11,466 --> 01:09:13,466
- No, no, no, no, Jamie!

1023
01:09:14,528 --> 01:09:16,445
This is your party, hm?

1024
01:09:18,164 --> 01:09:19,581
Hm, go, have fun.

1025
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:23,328
I'm gonna go home, to my house.

1026
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:25,578
And I'm gonna watch a show.

1027
01:09:27,798 --> 01:09:28,631
Whatever.

1028
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,212
- Jess come on, we love you too.

1029
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:33,045
- Yeah, okay.

1030
01:09:35,108 --> 01:09:36,504
Jamie, we're gonna have a good time.

1031
01:09:36,504 --> 01:09:38,929
A good time, you know, with your friends.

1032
01:09:38,929 --> 01:09:40,096
Jamie, Jamie.

1033
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,233
- Jamie.

1034
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:43,733
- It's your party.

1035
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:47,629
Fortunately, there is still alcohol.

1036
01:09:47,629 --> 01:09:50,315
So drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink,

1037
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:52,317
drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.

1038
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:54,039
All right, cups up.

1039
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:55,111
Whoo!

1040
01:09:55,111 --> 01:09:56,944
- To Jamie and Jessie.

1041
01:09:58,293 --> 01:10:00,876
To Jamie and Jessie!

1042
01:10:04,286 --> 01:10:07,746
♫ We don't want to take no sides

1043
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:11,465
♫ It's gettin' sticky with you guys

1044
01:10:11,465 --> 01:10:15,060
♫ Come back out and have a drink

1045
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,748
♫ For you we'll mix up something pink

1046
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:22,434
♫ For you I'll muddle something pink

1047
01:10:22,434 --> 01:10:26,074
♫ Your appetite for the ladies

1048
01:10:26,074 --> 01:10:29,537
♫ Gets you in such trouble

1049
01:10:29,537 --> 01:10:33,177
♫ But we find you entertaining

1050
01:10:33,177 --> 01:10:36,929
♫ So get out here on the double

1051
01:10:36,929 --> 01:10:40,492
♫ No matter what we'll still be here

1052
01:10:40,492 --> 01:10:44,740
♫ In fact I'll have another beer

1053
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,711
- Hey!

1054
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:46,755
Yeah, come on!

1055
01:10:46,755 --> 01:10:47,990
I'll have another one too.

1056
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,114
Or two.

1057
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:49,947
I had about four too many.

1058
01:10:49,947 --> 01:10:51,213
Come on, out.

1059
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:52,046
No.

1060
01:10:52,046 --> 01:10:53,237
Oh, but you
borrowed the purple shirt.

1061
01:10:53,237 --> 01:10:55,703
- I'll mow anything you want.
- Come on, Jamie.

1062
01:10:55,703 --> 01:10:57,146
We're not leaving.

1063
01:10:57,146 --> 01:10:57,997
- You're super-selfish.

1064
01:10:57,997 --> 01:10:59,538
- But we like you.

1065
01:10:59,538 --> 01:11:02,751
♫ It'll all work out

1066
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:06,386
♫ Sweet Jamie dear

1067
01:11:06,386 --> 01:11:07,723
♫ And when you wake up

1068
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:09,962
♫ You'll still be queer

1069
01:11:09,962 --> 01:11:11,454
♫ And when you wake up

1070
01:11:11,454 --> 01:11:14,787
♫ You'll still be queer

1071
01:11:53,216 --> 01:11:57,383
♫ Don't let my eyes tell lies

1072
01:12:06,082 --> 01:12:08,732
♫ Its been harder--

1073
01:12:08,732 --> 01:12:10,078
- That really sucked you told everybody

1074
01:12:10,078 --> 01:12:12,245
I sold my eggs for money.

1075
01:12:15,534 --> 01:12:17,870
That was horrifying.

1076
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:21,537
♫ I've been afraid to walk

1077
01:12:26,797 --> 01:12:28,964
- That really sucked Jess!

1078
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:33,711
♫ To feel it--

1079
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:46,570
- Oh my god, honey.

1080
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:51,300
Let me get you a washcloth.

1081
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,731
Will you turn that off, oh god.

1082
01:12:52,731 --> 01:12:54,148
Sorry.

1083
01:13:00,996 --> 01:13:02,492
I'm sorry.

1084
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:04,159
For what?

1085
01:13:08,409 --> 01:13:09,242
Jessie,

1086
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:14,678
you're one of the coolest girls I know.

1087
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:17,230
But you know me.

1088
01:13:21,699 --> 01:13:24,116
No one compares to you, Jess.

1089
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:34,551
Think you can go lay down?

1090
01:13:34,551 --> 01:13:35,801
Yeah.

1091
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,183
Oh, nope.

1092
01:13:50,874 --> 01:13:52,457
This way.

1093
01:13:53,789 --> 01:13:57,207
I'll turn on your fan, get you some water.

1094
01:13:57,207 --> 01:13:58,040
Let's go.

1095
01:14:20,153 --> 01:14:20,986
Hey.

1096
01:14:22,252 --> 01:14:23,085
- Hey.

1097
01:14:24,508 --> 01:14:27,136
How you feeling'?

1098
01:14:27,136 --> 01:14:28,940
- Better-ish.

1099
01:14:31,857 --> 01:14:32,690
- Yeah.

1100
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:39,078
Mm, this is good.

1101
01:14:42,618 --> 01:14:43,535
Want some?

1102
01:14:47,523 --> 01:14:48,356
- Mmm.

1103
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:55,281
I don't make it as good as you though.

1104
01:14:55,281 --> 01:14:57,763
- Got to put the peanut butter on first,

1105
01:14:57,763 --> 01:15:00,263
then the butter then the jam.

1106
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:10,634
- So much for low carb.

1107
01:15:20,387 --> 01:15:22,198
- It's a cougar.

1108
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:28,685
- Stripes and spots.

1109
01:15:44,682 --> 01:15:46,184
- Yeah.

1110
01:15:46,184 --> 01:15:47,684
- Then answer it.

1111
01:15:51,357 --> 01:15:52,190
- Hi.

1112
01:15:54,031 --> 01:15:54,864
Hey.

1113
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:00,703
No, I'm not doing anything, I just got up.

1114
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:20,171
♫ Hands pressed hard against the window

1115
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:24,985
♫ Looking out like a puppy

1116
01:16:24,985 --> 01:16:28,402
♫ Waiting for its master

1117
01:16:29,308 --> 01:16:32,596
♫ Your mattress, the biscuit's quenched

1118
01:16:32,596 --> 01:16:35,970
♫ And you think a little too much

1119
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:38,303
♫ About her

1120
01:16:39,312 --> 01:16:41,645
♫ About her

1121
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,611
♫ Be all that

1122
01:16:46,611 --> 01:16:50,444
♫ You see I'm trouble for you

1123
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,379
- Don't forget that one.

1124
01:16:53,379 --> 01:16:54,960
I got ya.

1125
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,210
It's all right.

1126
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:57,918
Good?

1127
01:16:57,918 --> 01:16:59,881
Yeah, that was awesome.

1128
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,913
Swimming right off the boat,
I've never done that before.

1129
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,294
God, it was beautiful today.

1130
01:17:04,294 --> 01:17:05,692
- Yeah it was.

1131
01:17:05,692 --> 01:17:07,618
- You got some sun.

1132
01:17:07,618 --> 01:17:09,035
- It's worth it.

1133
01:17:09,966 --> 01:17:11,968
- Your hair's all wet.

1134
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:13,846
- That happens when you go swimming.

1135
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:14,679
- Yeah.

1136
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:16,772
Come here.

1137
01:17:27,355 --> 01:17:29,294
You make me feel like
John Cougar Mellencamp.

1138
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:33,117
- Like what, Jack and Diane or,

1139
01:17:33,117 --> 01:17:34,852
or Little Pink Houses or something?

1140
01:17:37,389 --> 01:17:38,722
- I don't know.

1141
01:17:44,046 --> 01:17:46,696
Um, I've, I've got to home.

1142
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:48,528
I gotta wake up early.

1143
01:17:48,528 --> 01:17:50,060
Is that okay?

1144
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,060
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

1145
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:55,278
Here I'll, I'll take these two, okay?

1146
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:56,111
- Okay.

1147
01:18:35,072 --> 01:18:37,405
- It's hemp milk, it's good.

1148
01:18:45,042 --> 01:18:46,570
- I wish you wouldn't do that.

1149
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:49,447
- That tastes like sidewalk chalk.

1150
01:18:49,447 --> 01:18:50,450
- Yum.

1151
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:51,283
- Spider, spider!

1152
01:18:51,283 --> 01:18:52,200
- Oh, shit.

1153
01:18:53,248 --> 01:18:56,748
- Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
- Go, go, go, go.

1154
01:19:04,646 --> 01:19:05,965
- My hero.

1155
01:20:00,668 --> 01:20:02,257
Is this my underwear?

1156
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:05,840
Yeah.

1157
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:08,852
Ah-ah.

1158
01:20:18,776 --> 01:20:23,105
♫ Come on baby just light my fire

1159
01:20:23,105 --> 01:20:28,062
♫ Come on baby just light my fire

1160
01:20:28,062 --> 01:20:32,229
♫ Come on baby just light my fire

1161
01:20:33,397 --> 01:20:36,647
♫ Come on baby tonight

1162
01:20:38,336 --> 01:20:43,258
♫ Come on baby just light my fire

1163
01:20:43,258 --> 01:20:46,758
♫ Come on baby just light

1164
01:20:48,559 --> 01:20:52,726
♫ Come on baby just light my fire

1165
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:56,951
♫ Come on baby tonight

1166
01:20:58,843 --> 01:21:03,836
♫ Come on baby just light my fire

1167
01:21:03,836 --> 01:21:07,336
♫ Come on baby just light

1168
01:21:08,808 --> 01:21:12,975
♫ Come on baby just light my fire

1169
01:21:14,215 --> 01:21:17,465
♫ Come on baby tonight

1170
01:21:19,487 --> 01:21:22,070
♫ Come on baby

1171
01:21:24,478 --> 01:21:27,061
♫ Come on baby

1172
01:21:47,418 --> 01:21:48,251
- Hi.

1173
01:21:52,091 --> 01:21:55,674
That's true.

1174
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:20,544
- Yeah.

1175
01:22:25,897 --> 01:22:28,397
- I can't, I'm going sailing.

1176
01:23:59,962 --> 01:24:03,379
♫ Hearts beat, eyes roll

1177
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:10,793
♫ Lips meet drum roll

1178
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,384
♫ Built up to this moment with you

1179
01:24:22,823 --> 01:24:26,990
♫ Build up to this feeling so true

1180
01:24:28,956 --> 01:24:31,123
♫ But you

1181
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:36,237
♫ Can't stay, can't stay

1182
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:41,409
♫ Can't stay any longer so you

1183
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:44,159
♫ Move your feet

1184
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:47,717
♫ Move your feet

1185
01:24:47,717 --> 01:24:51,160
♫ So you move your feet

1186
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,410
♫ As far as you can go

1187
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:01,323
♫ Move your feet

1188
01:25:01,323 --> 01:25:04,656
♫ As far as they can--

1189
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:16,091
- I'm a little worried about you.

1190
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:16,924
Come on.

1191
01:25:18,778 --> 01:25:20,528
Step into my office.

1192
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:30,789
So what's going on with Jamie?

1193
01:25:30,789 --> 01:25:31,956
- I messed up.

1194
01:25:32,809 --> 01:25:33,642
We slept together

1195
01:25:33,642 --> 01:25:34,952
a few days ago.
Oh my god.

1196
01:25:34,952 --> 01:25:35,785
- Yeah.

1197
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:37,100
- No way, are you like--

1198
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:39,245
- Well, and then I slept with her lover.

1199
01:25:40,299 --> 01:25:41,293
How did that even happen?
- I know.

1200
01:25:41,293 --> 01:25:44,413
I-I-I-I-I went over there
and I said that I lo,

1201
01:25:44,413 --> 01:25:46,804
that Jamie had taken my hoodie,

1202
01:25:46,804 --> 01:25:49,265
that she had left over at Rhonda's.

1203
01:25:49,265 --> 01:25:51,098
- Oh that's not good.

1204
01:25:52,813 --> 01:25:54,063
- I know that.

1205
01:25:57,775 --> 01:26:01,942
- Okay, I can't believe
that Rhonda did that either.

1206
01:26:04,018 --> 01:26:07,008
- Yeah, afterwards she said that we um,

1207
01:26:07,008 --> 01:26:08,414
were probably just doing it

1208
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:11,544
so that we could get closer to Jamie.

1209
01:26:13,237 --> 01:26:14,276
- Yeah.

1210
01:26:14,276 --> 01:26:15,109
- Yikes.

1211
01:26:16,967 --> 01:26:17,800
- Thanks.

1212
01:26:27,647 --> 01:26:30,164
Which is so funny because she's
not even my type, you know?

1213
01:26:30,164 --> 01:26:32,081
- Whatever that means.

1214
01:26:33,143 --> 01:26:36,247
Oh my god, does Jamie know?

1215
01:26:36,247 --> 01:26:38,222
- Oh god, I don't know, I
mean I haven't told her.

1216
01:26:38,222 --> 01:26:40,805
Um, I don't know if Rhonda has.

1217
01:26:41,813 --> 01:26:43,374
I was gonna tell her right away, you know,

1218
01:26:43,374 --> 01:26:44,653
to just kind of like get back at her

1219
01:26:44,653 --> 01:26:45,767
and stuff like that--

1220
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,596
- This is really good.

1221
01:26:52,596 --> 01:26:54,719
- Come on, for that audition
thing, are you kidding?

1222
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:56,696
- Well I-I-I-I didn't really have

1223
01:26:56,696 --> 01:26:59,053
fully think this all out, okay?

1224
01:26:59,053 --> 01:27:00,689
- Okay.

1225
01:27:00,689 --> 01:27:02,882
- I felt better for like
48 minutes afterwards.

1226
01:27:03,821 --> 01:27:05,190
Because she's leaving in like three days.

1227
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:06,422
I mean, are you still gonna still tell her

1228
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:09,800
that you're in love with her, or?

1229
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,050
- I don't know.

1230
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,690
I'm all smooshed up, Dawn.

1231
01:27:16,466 --> 01:27:18,017
- Okay, let me ask you a question.

1232
01:27:18,017 --> 01:27:20,184
Do you dream about Jamie?

1233
01:27:21,092 --> 01:27:21,925
Sometimes.

1234
01:27:21,925 --> 01:27:24,472
- Okay, in these dreams
what are you guys doing?

1235
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:25,758
- Stupid stuff, like you know,

1236
01:27:25,758 --> 01:27:27,511
doing laundry or watching TV or--

1237
01:27:27,511 --> 01:27:30,261
- Okay, okay, and this
new girl, Elizabeth.

1238
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:32,824
How do you feel when you're with her?

1239
01:27:32,824 --> 01:27:34,739
- Kind of shy.

1240
01:27:34,739 --> 01:27:36,747
You know, nervous, excited.

1241
01:27:37,947 --> 01:27:39,767
Yeah, but
without the goopy eye things.

1242
01:27:39,767 --> 01:27:41,750
- I mean, do you feel like, eager to

1243
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:44,488
touch her and just to be near her?

1244
01:27:44,488 --> 01:27:45,425
- Yeah.

1245
01:27:45,425 --> 01:27:47,924
- Do you like, feel your shit
drawn to her like a magnet?

1246
01:27:47,924 --> 01:27:49,287
Geez Dawn, yeah, yeah.

1247
01:27:51,997 --> 01:27:53,959
- Talking's good.

1248
01:27:53,959 --> 01:27:57,185
You know, she, she, she gets my jokes.

1249
01:27:57,185 --> 01:27:59,490
Time goes by quickly.

1250
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:02,540
- Do you think about Elizabeth
when you pull espresso?

1251
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,040
Like, her eyes and her mouth?

1252
01:28:08,813 --> 01:28:09,646
- Yeah.

1253
01:28:11,423 --> 01:28:12,256
- Okay.

1254
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:14,774
One last question.

1255
01:28:19,838 --> 01:28:24,005
Okay, pretend Jamie asks you
to be with her, as a lover.

1256
01:28:25,141 --> 01:28:28,955
And asks you to go to New York with her.

1257
01:28:28,955 --> 01:28:30,538
What would you do?

1258
01:28:38,228 --> 01:28:39,561
Take your time.

1259
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,833
- I wouldn't go.

1260
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:51,366
Why not?

1261
01:28:52,405 --> 01:28:56,572
- 'Cause I don't want to
follow her around anymore.

1262
01:28:59,672 --> 01:29:03,091
'Cause I'm not in love with her.

1263
01:29:03,091 --> 01:29:06,243
I mean, I think I was,
but I'm not anymore.

1264
01:29:06,243 --> 01:29:08,346
Are you sure?

1265
01:29:08,346 --> 01:29:09,179
- I mean,

1266
01:29:10,998 --> 01:29:13,517
she knows me better than anybody.

1267
01:29:13,517 --> 01:29:16,688
And, and I would do anything
for her and I love her

1268
01:29:16,688 --> 01:29:20,855
and, and I don't ever want
her to forget about me but,

1269
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:23,924
I'm not in love with her.

1270
01:29:28,498 --> 01:29:32,269
Holy shit,
Dawn, I am like, I'm,

1271
01:29:32,269 --> 01:29:35,862
I-I-I, okay, I kinda have bad self esteem

1272
01:29:35,862 --> 01:29:38,229
and I'm kinda this neurotic mess, but,

1273
01:29:38,229 --> 01:29:40,646
I am not in love with Jamie.

1274
01:29:43,703 --> 01:29:47,007
Yeah, okay cool, I'm, I'm gonna go.

1275
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:47,954
Okay, I have--
- Okay.

1276
01:29:47,954 --> 01:29:52,305
I mean I have to
talk to her about, stuff.

1277
01:29:52,305 --> 01:29:53,138
- Yeah.

1278
01:29:55,331 --> 01:29:56,251
Thank you.

1279
01:29:56,251 --> 01:29:58,334
- Yeah, you are welcome.

1280
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:07,293
- I'm not in love.

1281
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:41,692
Hey.

1282
01:30:41,692 --> 01:30:42,599
- Hey.

1283
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:48,809
- Streetcar Named Desire just came on.

1284
01:30:48,809 --> 01:30:51,757
- That's interesting, how
bout something a little,

1285
01:30:51,757 --> 01:30:54,340
I don't know, less depressing?

1286
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:01,032
- Sure.

1287
01:31:04,203 --> 01:31:06,203
- It uh, it makes me sad

1288
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:10,807
that we haven't been getting along lately.

1289
01:31:10,807 --> 01:31:11,640
- Yeah.

1290
01:31:12,656 --> 01:31:15,573
- And um, I was talking to Rhonda.

1291
01:31:20,951 --> 01:31:25,490
- Well I mean, she's not
my Rhonda but you know.

1292
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:26,726
You know Rhonda.
- I know two Rhondas.

1293
01:31:26,726 --> 01:31:28,038
There's a Rhonda that
lives down the street

1294
01:31:28,038 --> 01:31:28,937
and then there's your Rhonda.

1295
01:31:28,937 --> 01:31:30,748
- Well, the Rhonda that we both know.

1296
01:31:30,748 --> 01:31:32,557
- Your Rhonda, so you're
talking about your Rhonda.

1297
01:31:32,557 --> 01:31:33,557
Okay, yeah?

1298
01:31:36,266 --> 01:31:37,339
So, what?

1299
01:31:37,339 --> 01:31:40,922
- Well, I was just um,
I was talking to her

1300
01:31:42,143 --> 01:31:43,226
and she said,

1301
01:31:45,936 --> 01:31:49,103
I was telling her I'm gonna miss you.

1302
01:31:51,861 --> 01:31:54,444
- I'm, I'm gonna miss you too.

1303
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:56,913
- An, and uh,

1304
01:31:59,894 --> 01:32:01,181
I mean--

1305
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:07,340
- Well, you know how important
you are to me, right?

1306
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:10,757
I'm gonna call you like ten times a day.

1307
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:15,984
- Of course, and I'll
probably do that too, but?

1308
01:32:18,702 --> 01:32:19,717
And um--

1309
01:32:20,922 --> 01:32:25,089
- Well, hopefully Elizabeth
knows how to handle you.

1310
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:29,583
- I think she does.

1311
01:32:31,775 --> 01:32:32,858
- Well then.

1312
01:32:37,382 --> 01:32:38,382
- Well I...

1313
01:32:43,246 --> 01:32:47,278
- Can we just watch
animals eat each other?

1314
01:32:47,278 --> 01:32:49,036
I'll rub your feet.

1315
01:32:49,036 --> 01:32:50,516
Yay, yay, yeah?

1316
01:32:50,516 --> 01:32:51,738
- Yeah, yes, yes.

1317
01:32:51,738 --> 01:32:54,905
- Give me your feet please, thank you.

1318
01:32:57,283 --> 01:32:59,913
Oopsies.

1319
01:32:59,913 --> 01:33:01,330
Look at his head.

1320
01:33:02,316 --> 01:33:03,149
It's huge.

1321
01:33:04,853 --> 01:33:07,020
I mean, I think it's a he.

1322
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:40,403
- In two days I'm gonna be in Brooklyn,

1323
01:33:42,465 --> 01:33:44,132
eating a real bagel.

1324
01:33:45,318 --> 01:33:49,068
- Yeah, you won't have
sky like this though.

1325
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,036
- I'll have stars though.

1326
01:33:54,036 --> 01:33:55,786
Madonna lives there.

1327
01:33:57,599 --> 01:34:00,540
- Yeah, I heard that Michelle
Williams lives in Brooklyn.

1328
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,694
- She's lovely.

1329
01:34:10,122 --> 01:34:11,336
Madonna.

1330
01:34:12,704 --> 01:34:15,128
I'd go for Michelle.

1331
01:34:15,128 --> 01:34:17,295
Yeah you would.

1332
01:34:20,969 --> 01:34:22,302
- I'm goin' in.

1333
01:34:31,925 --> 01:34:32,758
Hey Jamie?

1334
01:34:32,758 --> 01:34:33,591
- Yeah.

1335
01:34:40,289 --> 01:34:42,630
That's all Jessie!
