1
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,296
Hundred bucks a plate.

2
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:30,598
They cannot pour
a decent cup of coffee.

3
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:32,638
Your refined palate for coffee.

4
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,263
Coffee is coffee already.

5
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:35,500
Really?

6
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,941
Take a sip.
Doesn't it taste like garbage?

7
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:39,602
I don't know how garbage tastes.

8
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:41,044
It tastes like cof...

9
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:41,944
Shut up.

10
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:45,882
But I have smelled garbage,
and I'll tell you what...

11
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:49,186
this here coffee...
it smells like coffee.

12
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,754
Let's do this thing, huh?

13
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,682
I'm hearing that someone
lifted jewelry from a heist

14
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,260
the other day.

15
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:29,328
You know about that?

16
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:30,418
I don't know...

17
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,431
Don't lie to me
like I'm Judge Judy!

18
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,470
Young people today
take no responsibility.

19
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,571
It's the decline
of the two-parent household.

20
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:49,977
What are you talking about?

21
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:53,415
My old man left when I was ten.
I turned out fine.

22
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,511
This kid's just a punk.

23
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:57,247
Okay.

24
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,620
Okay, okay.

25
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:04,857
I lifted a couple of necklaces,
but I still got 'em, I swear.

26
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:11,302
I got a buddy.
He's keeping 'em in the safe.

27
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,998
All right,
you're taking us there.

28
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:16,974
I don't want no more, uh,
little fandangos here.

29
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,339
Wrap up our package.

30
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:19,776
With what?

31
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,110
Do I care with what?
Rope, chain, whatever.

32
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:23,079
What, his cumberbund?

33
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:25,241
We don't got nothing.

34
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,012
You just told us about this.

35
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,848
But if you'd have told us...

36
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:31,150
I'll send you an e-mail next time!

37
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,249
We're in a commercial
establishment, right?

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,055
Find a utility closet.

39
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:36,093
They got rope, string.

40
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,460
I don't care.
Just get it done!

41
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:44,369
I think he'd be perfect.
His name is Carlo.

42
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,369
The eyes, the hair.

43
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:48,441
- Where you been?
- What do you care?

44
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:53,002
Who is it this week?
It's Connie Tadero's sister.

45
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,610
Can I ask you something?

46
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,083
I don't want to disturb...

47
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:01,949
No.
How are you?

48
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:04,819
- Not bad.
- How you been?

49
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,620
Um, give us a minute.

50
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:07,852
Please.

51
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,697
Look at this.

52
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:21,638
I got a plate of gravy
and no macaroni.

53
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,209
My wife's idea.

54
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:25,801
Low-carb diet.

55
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:26,708
Oh, yeah.

56
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:30,180
I tell ya, I meet Dr. Atkins,
I'm gonna kill him.

57
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:35,153
So, how's that thing?

58
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,222
That thing is good.

59
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:38,052
We're taking care of it now.

60
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,955
Good, good, good.

61
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:47,557
Now listen, Beans, not for nuthin',
but you know I think you're aces.

62
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,532
You're one of my best earners.

63
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:50,432
Thanks, Angelo.

64
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:54,200
I always saw you as kind
of a father to me, you know?

65
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:57,538
That's why I want you
to hear it from me first.

66
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,873
I'm making Mickey Valecci
the new captain.

67
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:11,424
That's, uh... good.

68
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,082
Mickey's good people.

69
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:15,525
I knew I could count
on your support.

70
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:20,731
Yeah, well, you're like
a father to me.

71
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,567
I'll take care of that thing now.

72
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:26,866
Uh huh.

73
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,999
- Enjoy your meat.
- All right, Beans.

74
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,746
Hey, I found some duct tape.

75
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:38,045
I said to make sure
he doesn't go anywhere,

76
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,209
not wrap him like a Cuban cigar!

77
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:41,217
You said, "Wrap."

78
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,913
It was a figure of speech!

79
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,923
Why is he in his underwear?

80
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:50,122
The tux has to be back;
he used his mom's credit card.

81
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,826
I'll drop it off on the way;
it's no big deal.

82
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:57,630
We kidnap him
and make stops along the way?

83
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:58,465
Brilliant!

84
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,505
How you gonna get him out?

85
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:03,234
How can he walk
looking like a mummy?

86
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:05,868
He can hop.
Show the man your hop.

87
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:09,813
Go on. Hop up and down
or I'll stab you in the leg.

88
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,382
I mean it!

89
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,083
He can hop.

90
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:34,670
We got Carmine "The Beans" Pasquale
and his crew

91
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:37,004
with Jimmy Amoroso in the trunk.

92
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,671
I think we're the ones
that get a big gift.

93
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,176
Attention: Crappy Mart shoppers,
the store is closed.

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,220
Oh, what is this?

95
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:50,584
You, let's go.

96
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,554
I'm buying smokes.

97
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,888
Smokin'll kill you or I will.

98
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,551
Now beat it.

99
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,424
What's going on?

100
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:57,223
Where's the safe?

101
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,026
- You robbing me?
- No, that's already been done.

102
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,260
We're here to take back what's ours.

103
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:08,773
Jimmy, I thought you told me
those were gifts for your old lady.

104
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:13,175
I want you guys to know I didn't
have nothin' to do with of this.

105
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,473
Asalamalakem.

106
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:23,389
Just doing my part to reach out.

107
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:25,953
Bada-bingo!

108
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:28,050
Aw, you broke my safe, dog!

109
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,352
Oh gees.

110
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:32,756
FBI! Freeze!

111
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:33,855
I'm not doin' nuthin'.

112
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,059
All right. Okay.

113
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:44,104
Look, Carmine, kidnapping,
accessory to a jewelry heist,

114
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,044
coupled out with your rap sheet,
you're looking at 20 years.

115
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,137
Twenty-five...

116
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,682
Unless you want to play ball.

117
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,487
I could do 20 years
standing on my head, boys.

118
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:03,221
As I'm sure you could.

119
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,765
You know, Carmine,
I've got to be honest,

120
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:08,390
we're amazed that you slipped.

121
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,799
It's devastating.
Tragic.

122
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:15,034
If Angelo Marcello is worried
you'll talk, he might hear

123
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:18,440
you're upset about getting
passed over for promotion.

124
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,069
You know how rumors fly.

125
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,874
Like rockets.

126
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,878
To the moon.

127
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,074
Do you take your show
on the road?

128
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:26,378
Go to schools?
Keep kids off drugs?

129
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,783
Because your little puppet show,
very entertaining.

130
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:29,855
Yeah?

131
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:32,048
Who do you think is pulling strings?

132
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,127
Clearly, Angelo Marcello
is pulling the strings.

133
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:37,594
And if he thinks
that you're talking,

134
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:42,798
you're going to be doing
a lot more time six feet under.

135
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:50,172
Unless, unless, and I'm just
thinking out loud here, but um...

136
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:56,146
unless you actually do talk,
then we can at least help you out.

137
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:00,152
Six accused members
of the Marcello crime family,

138
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:02,777
including mafia boss
Angelo Marcello,

139
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:07,154
were found guilty today
of twelve counts of extortion
and racketeering.

140
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,125
Prosecutors credited the victory

141
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:12,528
to testimony of longtime
Marcello crime family member,

142
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:14,600
Carmine "The Beans" Pasquale.

143
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,726
Pasquale is now believed
to have entered

144
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,963
the Federal Witness
Protection Program.

145
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:21,700
Let's go live...

146
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:24,470
...not being able to see
her great-grandson no more,

147
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:26,670
Grandma Florentino
is gonna be heartbroken.

148
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,110
Oh, please!

149
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,808
When she came from the old country,
the statue said,

150
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,441
"Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses..."

151
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:34,610
Know why they huddled?

152
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:37,951
She was beatin' the crap out of
everybody with that wooden spoon.

153
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:39,217
You know what, Carmine?

154
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:42,021
The place may change,
but you'll always be a jerk.

155
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,652
Will you guys shut up?

156
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:47,563
Oh! You do not talk
to me like that.

157
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,898
You know what this is?
Rap music.

158
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:53,268
It breeds disrespect like a fungus.

159
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:58,709
The names these guys have:
Slim Shady, Puff Daddy.

160
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:00,938
He goes by P-Diddy for short.

161
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,105
For short?
Why?

162
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:05,775
It takes all day to say "Puff"?
Oh! I'm exhausted.

163
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,546
Look who's talking about names.

164
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:09,416
They call you Carmine "The Beans."

165
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:13,788
Yes, because I grind
my own beans for coffee.

166
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,327
A nickname has to be married...

167
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:17,191
What?

168
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:19,629
You're no longer known
as "Carmine The Beans."

169
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,461
You're George,
Linda, and Patrick Cheeseman.

170
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,535
Cheeseman.
What is that, French?

171
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,537
Who's Patrick? Who's George?
Because I ain't no "George."

172
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,163
I ain't no "George," either.

173
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,037
I think Linda's a beautiful name.

174
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:32,703
I always wished my mother
had named me Linda.

175
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,177
Should've named you
"Chatty Kathy."

176
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:35,178
Just zip it.

177
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:38,011
I ain't no "Patrick."
They call you "Pat" for short.

178
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,482
"Pat" is a girl's name,

179
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:43,021
and I ain't no name
that goes both ways.

180
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:46,387
Look, we have driver's licenses,
birth certificates, bankcards,

181
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,960
social security cards,
and supermarket rewards cards.

182
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:51,826
They're all made out to George,
Patrick, and Linda Cheeseman.

183
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,162
Well then, I'm going by "Rick,"
because I ain't no "Pat."

184
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:58,998
So, Agent Banks, where we moving to?

185
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,022
Mr. And Mrs. Cheeseman,
I'm Special Agent Tuttle.

186
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,682
Welcome to Utah.

187
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,158
Okay, the arrangements
have been made for you

188
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,024
to stay in a hotel tonight,

189
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,428
then provide you with a vehicle.

190
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:27,931
How many wives you got?

191
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:28,898
Just one.

192
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,230
You're not a Mormon?

193
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,237
I am. The Church hasn't
practiced polygamy for 100 years.

194
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,899
It's the offshoot groups
that still have plural wives.

195
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,035
You'd have to shoot me.
Having one is bad enough.

196
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:43,172
It'd be nice to have more than one.
Give me a break from you.

197
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,510
I'll grab your bags.

198
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,617
We're right out here.

199
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:46,616
Take a break.

200
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,708
- Fine.
- Go ahead.

201
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:48,843
Find me somebody else.

202
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,752
Preferably someone without
a mustache and a bad attitude.

203
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,895
This looks like
a whole lot of nothing.

204
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,694
Actually, it was a desert wasteland

205
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,464
when the Mormon Pioneers
arrived in July of 1847.

206
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,505
Under the leadership
of President Brigham Young,

207
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:08,369
the entire area...

208
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:11,034
You work for the Park Service
or the FBI?

209
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:13,669
.

210
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,475
Patrick, there's a lot to do...

211
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,139
It's Rick!

212
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:20,650
There's a lot to do
just a day's drive from here.

213
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:22,778
We've got the Grand Canyon,

214
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,322
there's Hollywood, Disneyland...

215
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:26,756
Disneyland.

216
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,794
My old man promised to take me
and you know what?

217
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,557
Took off and never came back.

218
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:34,758
I haven't had much desire
to visit there ever since.

219
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:37,358
I'm afraid it'll bring up
too much repressed anger.

220
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,129
Yeah?

221
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,831
So, take a Prozac
like a normal person.

222
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,400
So, what's the neighborhood
we're moving into like?

223
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:50,005
# We are all enlisted
till the conflict is o'er #

224
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,549
# Happy are we! #

225
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,052
# Happy are we! #

226
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:56,712
# Soldiers in the army #

227
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:59,950
# There's a bright crown
in store #

228
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,462
# We shall win
and wear it by and by ##

229
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:11,431
I received a page.
I have a family emergency.

230
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:21,370
We'd like
to excuse Bishop Harrison

231
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:25,349
who's had to attend to
a very important family matter.

232
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:29,148
Our concluding speaker will be
Brother Chris Moore.

233
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:30,415
Brother Moore.

234
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,365
- It's okay.
- Hang on, Brother Moore.

235
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,496
Let me try and get this
a little higher for you.

236
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,338
Brothers and sisters,
I'm grateful for the opportunity

237
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,072
to stand before you this...

238
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:57,477
Hang on.

239
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:03,945
It's moving, it's good.
It's coming.

240
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:10,357
Just take five,
brothers and sisters.

241
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:11,760
Thank you.

242
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,800
Sorry to hear
about Bishop Harrison's dad.

243
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,063
When are they leaving
for the funeral?

244
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:20,230
First thing in the morning.

245
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,706
They're worried about how his mom's
going to handle the farm alone.

246
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:27,210
He'll be gone 3-4 weeks
to sort things out.

247
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:30,180
With the bishop gone, does that mean
we won't have church?

248
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:33,752
No, sweetie,
with the bishop gone,

249
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:37,822
your daddy's first counselor
to the bishop and he'll be in charge.

250
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:41,393
He certainly had things
under control today, didn't he?

251
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:43,121
Thanks for the support there, Jewels.

252
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:44,423
Anytime, bro.

253
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,693
Exactly when are your parents
getting back from the Philippines?

254
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,292
Two years, ten months.

255
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:52,462
You got a countdown?

256
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:56,303
Technically she is my aunt,
but I despise her like a sister.

257
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:59,507
There's a "SOLD" sign
on the Cooper house.

258
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,204
When did that happen?

259
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:02,611
I don't know.

260
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:05,148
It has been vacant for a while.

261
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,242
Be nice to have someone in there.

262
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:09,684
He had eight stitches.

263
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,724
Yes, I just got off
the phone with his wife.

264
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:15,350
With Bishop Harrison gone
for who knows how long,

265
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:17,395
the inmates are running
the asylum.

266
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:20,662
Michael James in charge?
Please.

267
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:21,790
Mom.

268
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:23,868
Sister Johnson's on the phone.

269
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,063
Hold on, Robin.

270
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:29,073
Mary Jo, did you hear?
Eight stitches.

271
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:34,803
What? Are you sure?
When?

272
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:38,281
Run to the Cooper's house and see
if there's a "SOLD" sign.

273
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:39,146
Mom.

274
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:40,809
Just do it.

275
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,853
I wonder who's moving in.

276
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,549
This place is a shoebox!

277
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:46,989
It's a great house, George.

278
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,822
We got a satellite, right?

279
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,226
Actually, we cover the house,
but amenities are extra.

280
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,958
The government pays three grand
for a military toilet seat,

281
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,693
but they can't pop for HBO?

282
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,462
I can't believe it.

283
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,368
Why not send us to the Amish?

284
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,441
Because they sent us
to the Mormons.

285
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,803
Yeah, same difference.

286
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:05,536
Honestly, no, it's not.

287
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:09,081
Right... because the Amish wear
black shirts and ride in buggies,

288
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,150
but the Mormons wear white shirts
and ride bikes.

289
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:13,479
Completely different.

290
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:14,608
Okay. Look, George...

291
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:16,449
I hate that name.

292
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:17,522
Mr. Cheeseman.

293
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:18,555
Worse.

294
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:21,252
This right here is
your first month's stipend.

295
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,193
You'll get a few more
until you're on your feet.

296
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,629
What do I do for a ride?

297
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,222
You'll get that red minivan.

298
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:29,494
Are you kidding me?

299
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,968
- I think it's real cute.
- You would.

300
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:34,062
You drove an AMC Pacer when we met.

301
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:35,071
I loved it.

302
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:36,971
I was heartbroken when it got stolen.

303
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,976
You still think it got stole?

304
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,639
I paid Butch 20 bucks to drive it
into the river.

305
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:45,842
Why are you complaining?
I bought you a new Iroc-Z.

306
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:46,883
Oh!

307
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,253
Hi.
I'm Chris Moore.

308
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,793
These clowns are stealing my stuff!

309
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:56,589
We're your neighbors.

310
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,596
We're just here to help.

311
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:00,666
Oh.

312
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,993
Don't break nuthin'.

313
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:11,437
George, you've got to understand
people here are friendlier

314
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,671
than what you're normally used to.

315
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:17,738
Yeah, here two days, and no one
has flipped us the bird.

316
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,180
I don't want friendly.

317
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,286
I just want to be left alone.

318
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,196
- Hi.
- Hi.

319
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:41,137
I wanted to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

320
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,731
Thank you.
Please come in.

321
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:45,174
Thanks.

322
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,275
Um, I'm Louise Means.

323
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,287
I'm Linda Cheeseman.
This is my husband, George.

324
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,291
Nice to meet you, George.

325
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:01,883
These are for you.

326
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,656
Thank you. Have a seat.

327
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:07,995
Oh, thanks.

328
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,668
So, where did you move from?

329
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,211
Omaha, Nebraska.

330
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,746
You have a slight Eastern accent.

331
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:25,282
We're from the eastern side.

332
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:31,186
So, anything you want to know about
the neighborhood or the neighbors?

333
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,552
I got a question.

334
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:36,219
You're not going to come knocking
on my door 8:00 AM Saturday, are you?

335
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:37,989
Why would somebody do that?

336
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:41,430
Come on. I know you people.
It's what you do.

337
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:43,764
You go door-to-door,
knock, knock, knock,

338
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:46,736
talking to people,
preaching your Mormon Bible.

339
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,275
Meanwhile, inside are staying down
trying not to make a noise,

340
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,469
so you think we're not home.

341
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:56,639
So, you're not members?

342
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,977
Members of what?

343
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:01,985
Louise hasn't wasted any time
burning up the phone lines

344
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:04,954
letting people know
they're not members of the Church.

345
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:07,355
I just hope
she hasn't offended them.

346
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,354
We'll do a little damage control.

347
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,900
We'll show them the rest of us
are just regular, normal people.

348
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:22,598
Um, we can see you've got a lot
of unpacking to do.

349
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,903
We didn't want to intrude.

350
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,908
We just wanted to come over and
introduce ourselves... say "Hello."

351
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:33,041
No, it's no intrusion;
it's very nice of yous.

352
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:34,584
Something to drink?

353
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:35,415
Oh no.

354
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,455
No, let us get you something.

355
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,218
Okay, great.
Thank you.

356
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,297
I'll get you a beer.

357
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:48,423
Uh, no.

358
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:49,831
That's okay.

359
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:50,959
You said okay.

360
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,595
Right. I did.
Just no beer.

361
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:54,673
All right.
Whatever.

362
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:56,502
How bout you, Toots?

363
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,702
Um, no, no,
I'm fine thanks.

364
00:19:58,811 --> 00:19:59,573
What're you thinking?

365
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:02,306
She's not going to be drinking
while she's pregnant.

366
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,279
Why not? You did.

367
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:08,113
Actually, we don't drink at all...
alcohol.

368
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:12,657
- Is that a Mormon thing?
- Yes, we don't drink alcohol.

369
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:13,884
We got coffee.

370
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:17,326
Just that freeze-dried
sewer water that you buy.

371
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,398
Hey, that website I would get
my imported coffee from,

372
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:21,761
what was that called?

373
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,095
I don't know.

374
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,760
I'll Google it.

375
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,431
It's okay, because we don't
drink coffee, either.

376
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,806
We'll, go to the kiddy menu.

377
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:35,608
I'll get you a Coke;
and you a Diet Coke.

378
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:38,012
You're not going to believe this.

379
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,210
Um, there's some members
of our church that um,

380
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:42,980
choose to drink cola drinks,

381
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:47,218
but Michael and I, we happen
to not drink cola drinks.

382
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:49,351
What do you do
for liquid refreshment?

383
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:51,520
What, is your mother
still nursing you?

384
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:53,431
Thank you so much.

385
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:55,830
Yeah.

386
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,799
Goodnight.

387
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:58,369
Goodnight.
Nice to meet yous.

388
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,233
Thanks, you too.
Bye-bye.

389
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:04,268
That was interesting.

390
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,900
Yep.

391
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:18,253
Uh, hello, ma'am.
I'm Rick Cheeseman.

392
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,188
We just moved in down the street.

393
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,726
I'm Blanche Brinkerhoff.
Nice to meet you.

394
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:25,194
Blanche, Louise Means
is on the phone.

395
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,787
I'll call her back.

396
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:29,834
I was just walking around
meeting the neighbors and uh,

397
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:30,731
I was wondering,

398
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,669
do you know those people
with the satellite dish?

399
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:35,672
That's Bishop Harrison's.

400
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:37,867
I knocked, but nobody answered.

401
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:39,672
They're out of town.

402
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:40,938
Really? I see.

403
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,480
Hey, you wouldn't happen
to have a ladder

404
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:45,481
and some power tools, would ya?

405
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,089
Julie, let's go, lights out.

406
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,282
I still have homework.

407
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:53,415
Which you wouldn't have

408
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,322
if you hadn't been on the phone.

409
00:21:55,427 --> 00:21:58,294
If I still lived in California,
I could see my friends

410
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:00,661
and not worry
about making time for phone calls.

411
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:03,792
And making time to get up earlier
to do your homework,

412
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:05,767
because now it's time for bed.

413
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:06,838
Good night.

414
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,703
I hate this place!

415
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:16,747
You know, we need
to make an effort and reach out.

416
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:17,746
Really?

417
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:22,582
I was thinking more along the lines
of a padded room with a big lock,

418
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:27,955
and the only contact is to slide food
through this tiny, little slot.

419
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,186
What?

420
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:33,594
I'm talking about dealing
with your sister and her attitude.

421
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:37,533
I was talking about the Cheesemans
and their not being members.

422
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:38,625
What do you mean?

423
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:40,227
Well, I've just been thinking.

424
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,933
I know what it feels like
to be the minority.

425
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:47,775
My dad moves us down to the South,
and suddenly, I'm the only Mormon

426
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,576
in a high school filled with
born-again Christians.

427
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:54,810
I mean, I was voted
most likely to burn in hell.

428
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:56,750
I think dealing with your sister

429
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:59,949
comes in close second
to eternal damnation.

430
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,425
Didn't I get you Dr. Phil's book
on teenagers?

431
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,655
You said were going to open it.

432
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:09,832
"Ten Stupid Things Women Do
to Mess Up Their Lives."

433
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:15,903
Seriously honey, I know
she's your sister, and I love her.

434
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:18,568
I do; but something has to be done.

435
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:21,669
Okay. All right.
I'll, uh, I'll talk to her.

436
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,614
I promise, I'll...
A little tough love.

437
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:26,547
- You will?
- Sure.

438
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:28,710
Okay.
Thanks.

439
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:32,119
And about the Cheesemans,
why don't I call Linda tomorrow

440
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:34,692
and see if they want
to come to dinner?

441
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,761
Yes, yes. Good.

442
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:37,829
That would be nice.

443
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,488
I just, I don't know,

444
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:42,123
I gotta do something,
with the bishop gone...

445
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:44,099
gotta step it up a notch.

446
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,728
Don't worry.
You're doing a great job.

447
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,430
Don't stress.

448
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,769
The Cheesemans will fit in
just fine.

449
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:14,597
Excuse me, uh.

450
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,428
How you doin'?

451
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:17,126
That's my paper.

452
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:18,828
Oh yeah. Here you go.

453
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:25,070
You live here?

454
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:25,973
Yeah.

455
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:26,373
Yeah.

456
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:27,502
We're neighbors... over there.

457
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:29,171
That... house.

458
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:31,475
Yeah, well uh, my wife and I

459
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:36,987
were thinking about coming
over tonight or sometime or...

460
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:39,455
Do you mind, uh?

461
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:41,719
What? Oh yeah.

462
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:43,454
Sure.

463
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:46,861
That blonde girl.
That's your wife?

464
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:48,262
Nice.

465
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:51,700
Hey, you got one like that,
who needs twelve?

466
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:04,804
Ugh, this coffee is awful!

467
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,780
Really?

468
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:08,409
What do you mean "really?"
You think I'm lyin'?

469
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,021
Nah, I believe you.

470
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:12,123
No, no you don't.
You're questioning me.

471
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:13,417
It wasn't a question.

472
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:15,322
If there was a stenographer here

473
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:18,396
writing down our little
jovial repartee here,

474
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:20,897
she would have typed, "Really"
with a question mark.

475
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,866
I've had a lot of stuff
read back to me

476
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:26,494
that I said
that I didn't remember saying.

477
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:29,540
I meant I was surprised
that it was bad.

478
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,666
How could you?
Don't you drink it?

479
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:34,541
Nah, I don't drink coffee.

480
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:38,047
Let me guess.
You're Mormon.

481
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:39,081
Yeah.

482
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:41,152
Maybe that's why
Mormons don't drink it.

483
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:44,187
Because no one knows how
to make a good cup.

484
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:47,588
You know what, just give me
the paper and a Pick Six.

485
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,854
A pick six of what?

486
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:51,691
Numbers.

487
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,731
Winners.

488
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,629
You've got to be kidding me.

489
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:57,725
Besides not making good coffee,

490
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,963
Utah ain't got no lottery either.

491
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:05,308
They got no horse track.
They got no lottery.

492
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,843
They got nuthin' up here.

493
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:08,742
How far away is Vegas?

494
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,974
I don't know, but don't talk
about Vegas.

495
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:12,708
These people are the good,
church-goin' type.

496
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:13,545
That's another thing.

497
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:16,518
I'll go in there, I'll eat
their crappy, white-bread food,

498
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:19,853
but I ain't holdin' hands,
and I ain't singin' no "Kumbaya."

499
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,448
Take those off.

500
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,358
These people invite us to dinner.
You're gonna be pleasant.

501
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:27,660
I'm just sayin', if they bring out
the Bible Pictionary... gone.

502
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:29,961
A perfect game for you;
no words... all pictures.

503
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,228
That's very funny.

504
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:34,100
- Let me tell you something.
- Let me tell you...

505
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:40,402
Hi.
The kids are already started.

506
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,480
Everybody, this is
the Cheeseman family.

507
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:44,878
Uh, George, Linda, their son Rick.

508
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:47,042
Kepi, Laura, a couple of friends.

509
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:47,879
How ya doin'?

510
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,918
Nice to meet yous.

511
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:50,045
You remember Kate.

512
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:52,156
Hi, so glad you could make it.

513
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:55,124
And uh, several
of the children here.

514
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:57,388
We've got more
running around here someplace.

515
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:59,555
Shocker!

516
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,462
Hey, we brought you somethin'.

517
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:03,625
Oh, thanks.
You shouldn't have, really.

518
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:07,734
- We wanted to.
- It's not booze or nuthin'.

519
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,239
Yoohoo!
You shake it.

520
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:17,939
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

521
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:22,854
So George, what did you do
in Omaha before the move?

522
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,422
I was in waste management.

523
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:26,922
Then that's what
brought you out here?

524
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:29,391
In a manner of speaking, yeah.

525
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,689
How 'bout you, big guy?
What's your story?

526
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:32,957
How's that?

527
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,828
I haven't seen black people in Utah.

528
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:37,458
Did you get lost
on your way to somewhere?

529
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:40,231
No.
I'm not black; I'm Tongan.

530
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:43,866
I don't keep up with the
whole politically correct thing.

531
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:46,171
You know, I mean,
first you're Negroes.

532
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:48,371
Then you're blacks.
Now you're African Americans.

533
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,175
Now you're the Tongans?

534
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,510
I don't think it's as catchy...
whatever.

535
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:54,585
No.
I mean I'm from Tonga.

536
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:56,210
It's a South Pacific island.

537
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:59,324
Oh, like "Survivor."
I love that show.

538
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,289
I bet it's very clean there.

539
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:03,623
We moved here
for my husband's health.

540
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:04,889
The air is better.

541
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:06,430
Yeah, there's no cigarette smoke.

542
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:10,592
Let me ask yous, is that like
the body is a temple sort of thing?

543
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:11,327
What's that?

544
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:12,368
The no smoking.

545
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:13,938
Oh yeah, yeah.

546
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,202
It's a health code
that the Church practices.

547
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,867
I'll tell you something.

548
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:22,640
I have seen some of the biggest,
chunkiest people

549
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:26,239
I have ever seen in my life
waddling around Utah.

550
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:27,852
That was rude to say!

551
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:30,420
That's not rude.
It's just, it's the truth.

552
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:33,013
You've given up smokes;
you've given up booze.

553
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:35,490
Maybe should think
about giving up baked goods.

554
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:36,925
Chungaloones over here.

555
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,860
We should have made fruit salad.

556
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,829
No, no.
I don't mean yous.

557
00:28:40,932 --> 00:28:43,992
Fifty, a hundred pounds overweight,
that's not a big deal.

558
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:46,570
I am talking about fat people.

559
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:50,937
People walk down the street,
and you go, "Fat guy!"

560
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:53,409
Look at this guy.
He is a fat guy.

561
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:58,609
Guy on Jerry Springer... 1700 pounds.
What does he do for Halloween?

562
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,686
White sheet over his head
and he goes as one of the Alps?

563
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,446
What?

564
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,923
This is Michael with
Bishop Harrison a few years ago.

565
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:17,262
Let me ask yous two,

566
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,496
are you like what,
assistant ministers?

567
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:23,973
Well, uh, we're what you call
"counselors to the bishop."

568
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:26,306
Like the consigliere.

569
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:34,450
We also have full time jobs too.
Our work at the church is voluntary.

570
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:35,645
That's right.
That's right.

571
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:38,255
I know you don't
have anything lined up yet.

572
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:40,415
I mean... I could go into work

573
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:43,619
and talk to my manager about you
if you'd like.

574
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:45,161
Oh, that'd be great.

575
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:48,528
This is so nice.
Look at all this you got here.

576
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:52,262
You even saved your kid's hospital
ID tag from when they was born.

577
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,600
You know what?
If you're interested,

578
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:57,368
there are a ton
of scrapbooking stores around here.

579
00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:59,068
It's really popular.

580
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:03,671
There's stores where people
come to save their junk?

581
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:05,646
Oh yeah, they do very well.

582
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:08,617
Besides, it's not junk.
It's preserving memories.

583
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,689
Preserving memories?
What are you going to preserve?

584
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:14,690
What, old cocktail napkins
with guys' phone numbers on 'em?

585
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:16,420
Okay.
Who wants desert?

586
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:20,829
Sorry about my dad;
he's kind of got a big mouth.

587
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,025
You know what?
He's hysterical.

588
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:26,696
My family is so boring with their
domestic-tranquility lifestyle.

589
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:29,171
Your brother seems like kind of
a cool guy.

590
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:32,300
Yeah, whatever.
He was my last resort.

591
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,278
I lived in California before my
parent's moved to the Philippines.

592
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:39,248
My dad had to become
a mission president over there.

593
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:40,749
So jacked up.

594
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:44,015
I didn't want to go,
so I had to come here.

595
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:47,489
Your dad was a mission president.
What's that?

596
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:51,494
Those guys that come to your door
to talk about the Mormon Church.

597
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:53,564
- Mormon missionaries.
- Yeah.

598
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:54,791
Well, the mission president

599
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,132
is the really old guy in charge
of all those young guys.

600
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:00,761
I thought it would be cool

601
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:03,067
to give the Mormons
the Jehovah's Witnesses' addresses

602
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:05,234
and the Jehovah's Witnesses
the Mormons' addresses.

603
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:07,243
Have 'em go at it...

604
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:12,373
like religion's version
of the Bloods and the Crips.

605
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:14,609
- Do you ski?
- No.

606
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:18,086
I might do something,
if I don't want to die of boredom.

607
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,818
At least you have a satellite
dish to entertain you.

608
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:22,791
You saw that?

609
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:24,919
Your secret's safe with me.

610
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,393
Hey, no boys in the room.
You know the rules.

611
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,128
That was at home.
I didn't know that applied here.

612
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:32,897
Same family, same rules.

613
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:35,029
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to disrespect.

614
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,404
You didn't know.
Listen, we've got cake. Come on.

615
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:38,669
I'm watching my weight.

616
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:40,267
Watch it downstairs with us.

617
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:41,936
Let's go.

618
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,776
Rick, have you thought about
going out for sports

619
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:46,884
at the high school?

620
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:49,418
- Uh, no, probably not.
- Really?

621
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:52,490
You seem like the kind of guy
they could use.

622
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:55,253
Yeah?
Like what kind of sports?

623
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,887
You know, the regular ones.
Baseball, basketball, wrestling...

624
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:00,225
Wrestling?

625
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,424
You mean like, you know,
busting heads, fightin'?

626
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,731
Well, it's not like on TV.

627
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:07,498
No, no, no.
It's fighting.

628
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:09,733
The beauty is,
it's sanctioned by the school.

629
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:10,967
They let you!

630
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:15,376
Beat the crap out of kids,
and I don't get calls

631
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,471
from some p.o.'d
vice principal sayin',

632
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:21,780
"Your kid beat up this one,
he threatened this guy over here."

633
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,887
No fuss.

634
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:24,615
I'm not involved with you.

635
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:27,817
I love it!
Love it!

636
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:29,223
But it's not fighting.

637
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:31,727
No, no, it's not fighting at all.

638
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,129
Wink, wink, nod, nod.
I getcha.

639
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:44,868
Brother Cheeseman,
will you read us a story?

640
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:48,104
Oh, so you're a brother already?

641
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:49,373
You know what, sweetheart?

642
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:51,608
George is visiting.
Let's leave him alone.

643
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:57,154
Yeah, I can uh, yeah,
I can read a story to children.

644
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:59,849
What is this?
"The Three Little Pigs?"

645
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:03,394
I don't need a book.
I know this story!

646
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,827
You ready to hear it?
All right.

647
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,228
Once upon a time there were
three little pigs:

648
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,528
Antonio, Joseppi, and Fredo.

649
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:13,502
Antonio, he lived in a straw house.

650
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:16,369
Joseppi lived in a stick house.

651
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:18,442
And Fredo, nice brick house

652
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,602
with the cobblestone driveway
and the lights underneath

653
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:24,170
that show the trees at night...
adds to the curb appeal.

654
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:26,716
One day, Antonio,
in the straw house,

655
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:28,945
is sittin' around,
pickin' his teeth,

656
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:29,883
watchin' television,

657
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:33,116
when he hears a knock on the door.

658
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:35,624
It's a soft knock.
The door's made of straw.

659
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:37,251
Outside he hears,
"Big Bad Wolf,

660
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:39,387
"I'm here to collect
my protection money."

661
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:44,059
This is money that the wolf charges
them every month not to eat them.

662
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,330
Protection money.
They'd give money in an envelope.

663
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:49,965
Antonio was just sick of it.
He doesn't want to pay the wolf.

664
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:53,636
So Antonio says, "Forget it!
I'm not payin' you anymore!"

665
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:56,543
Now, this of course,
makes the wolf very irate.

666
00:33:56,648 --> 00:33:59,640
So, he says, "I am gonna huff,
I am gonna puff,

667
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:03,481
and I am gonna b-b-b-b-blow
your house down!"

668
00:34:03,588 --> 00:34:06,352
Antonio is very, very upset,
and the wolf huffs

669
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,359
and he puffs... blows it down.

670
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:12,055
Now, Antonio is losing
his little pig mind,

671
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:13,687
running around
screaming and yelling.

672
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:16,358
His house is ruined.
He's got no insurance.

673
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:18,368
He runs
to his buddy Joseppi's house.

674
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,198
Boom, boom, boom.

675
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:21,363
Joseppi, let me in!
The wolf just...

676
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:24,101
- "He blew it d..."
- "Yes, he blew it down!

677
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:26,677
Come on inside, sit down,
have an espresso, relax."

678
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:28,006
They're freakin' out.

679
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:30,809
Next thing you know...
boom, boom, boom.

680
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,712
Who do you think it is?

681
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:33,579
Big Bad Wolf.

682
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,151
Exactly.
The Big Bad Wolf.

683
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:38,689
Joseppi says, "Forget it.
I'm not gonna give money either."

684
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,282
Wolf says,
"All right, I'm a huff.

685
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:47,798
I'm a puff, and I'm gonna...
b-b-blow your house down!"

686
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,389
There's sticks all over the street.

687
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:52,664
People are slipping and falling...
like a John Woo film.

688
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,204
It's crazy!

689
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:57,866
Now these two pigs are
out of their... minds.

690
00:34:57,976 --> 00:34:59,170
Don't know what to do.

691
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:01,142
They run to their buddy Fredo's

692
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:03,578
with the big brick house.

693
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:04,181
Boom, boom.

694
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:05,577
He blew down our house.

695
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,150
Fredo says, "All right, come in."

696
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:09,379
"Help. He's gonna cut us.
He's gonna eat us."

697
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:11,489
Fredo's like,
"Please, have an espresso?

698
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:14,319
"Calm down. Relax.
I'll take care of it."

699
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:18,760
Fredo is as cool as a cucumber.
Walks over to the phone.

700
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:22,993
He dials some associates
and hangs up the phone.

701
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:26,002
The next thing you know...
big black Cadillac limo

702
00:35:26,104 --> 00:35:28,664
pulls up in front
of Fredo's brick house.

703
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:31,241
Two Goomba pigs
in dark suits get out.

704
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:32,639
They say,

705
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:34,644
"Excuse me.
You the Big Bad Wolf?"

706
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:35,713
He says, "Yeah."

707
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:37,611
They pick him up by his lapels

708
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:40,240
and start bangin' him
against the side of the house,

709
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:42,012
crackin' his brain
against the wall!

710
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:45,452
Then the pig reaches
into his pocket, pulls out his 9mm,

711
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,889
puts it against
the wolf's temple... badabing!

712
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:50,222
They blow his brains
all over his suit.

713
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:51,795
Boom!

714
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:53,989
Uh, George, I think we're...

715
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:55,463
This is the best part.

716
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:56,591
I think we probably...

717
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,396
This is the best part!
Trust me!

718
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:02,940
Then Antonio and Joseppi they go,
"Fredo, who was that?"

719
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,941
Fredo goes, "Ah, those guys?

720
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,204
Those are my cousins,
The Guinea Pigs."

721
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:12,875
Guinea Pigs...

722
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:14,985
Never mind.
The End!

723
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,451
Yeah! Yeah!!

724
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:21,986
Good kids, good kids.

725
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:24,288
Hey, tell you what kids, here.

726
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:26,124
Go get yourselves some ice cream.

727
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:27,630
That's fine.
Seriously.

728
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:28,892
What, it's ice cream?

729
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,936
They get an allowance...
garbage and things they do...

730
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:36,029
Eh, it's thirty bucks.
It's no big deal.

731
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,539
Well...

732
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:51,882
Hey, how are you?

733
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:55,759
Good to see you.

734
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:01,190
So, what's goin' on with that thing?

735
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,789
I looked into the thing.

736
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:03,697
And?

737
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:07,134
I talked to the guy;
he said it's early 20th century,

738
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:10,071
maybe you'll get
$200 - $300 at auction.

739
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:13,007
Stinkin' "Antiques Road Show"!

740
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:15,238
Getting everybody's
hopes up like that.

741
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:16,745
My Aunt Adeline... 87 years old.

742
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:18,348
She's up in the attic.

743
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:19,916
She's looking for things to bring.

744
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:22,019
Unbelievable!

745
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,519
What about that other thing?

746
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,485
Don't worry about that other thing.

747
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:32,119
We're gonna find Carmine,
and we're gonna kill 'im.

748
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:35,530
Kill 'im twice.

749
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:38,898
...his glorious resurrection
and ascension into heaven,

750
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:42,063
and ready to greet him
when he comes again.

751
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:48,840
We offer you in thanksgiving
this holy and living sacrifice.

752
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,107
Excuse me.

753
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:54,674
Father, not for nuthin',
but it's just the two of us?

754
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:55,844
Nobody else?

755
00:37:55,987 --> 00:38:00,583
There was an altar boy once,
but he left for college.

756
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:14,697
My husband said
yous guys was comin' over.

757
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:16,398
What?
I can't...

758
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:17,269
I...

759
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,809
I said, "My husband said
yous guys was comin'..."

760
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:21,310
Hey, where'd you go?

761
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:24,176
I came home from church
and went to the store.

762
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:25,408
You get the capicola?

763
00:38:25,516 --> 00:38:29,612
Excuse me; I'm trying to have
a conversation here.

764
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,585
With who?

765
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:39,262
These are the seven-thirties.

766
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:42,197
If you'll... just stand there,

767
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,598
I'll do that.

768
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:46,169
We're not a "big box" here.

769
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,602
I like to call it a customized store.

770
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:50,674
So, you'll find seven-thirties,
three-eighties...

771
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:51,469
Brother James.

772
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:53,976
President Perry, good to see you.

773
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:55,067
How are you?

774
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,511
I'm fine.
My wife has me fixing the gate,

775
00:38:57,615 --> 00:39:00,607
and I'm looking for
some specific hinges.

776
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:01,719
Yes, yes.

777
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:03,684
Hinges, I can take care of that.

778
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:06,313
Let me introduce you
to George here, first.

779
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:09,085
He just moved in a few weeks ago.

780
00:39:09,193 --> 00:39:10,455
This is President Perry.

781
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,654
He's a stake president,
we call that.

782
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:16,165
He's a sort of the leader
of many of the local congregations.

783
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:16,995
Like a president.

784
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:18,295
Like president of the Mormons?

785
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:19,734
Something like that, yeah.

786
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:23,405
What, you want to be
the teamsters now?

787
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,373
The Mormon Jimmy Hoffa?

788
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:27,569
Did I mention that George
is from Omaha?

789
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,704
My son served a mission to Omaha.

790
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:31,406
Bet he knocked on your door.

791
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:35,247
Well, if he did,
I didn't answer it, Mr. Hoffa.

792
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:38,514
The hinge aisle, President,
is just over in this area.

793
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:40,180
- I'll take care of this.
- Great.

794
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:42,724
Nice to have met you.

795
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:44,055
Wife's got 'im working.

796
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:45,026
Yeah, what?

797
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:47,120
Can get this cut in half?

798
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:52,294
Here.
You don't got a saw at home?

799
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:54,998
All right.

800
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,440
You want it exactly in half?

801
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,601
Preferably.
As close as you can get.

802
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,177
You have used one
of these before?

803
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,221
Yeah, but not to cut wood.

804
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:23,558
- Kate.
- Oh, Louise, you startled me.

805
00:40:23,668 --> 00:40:27,399
I'm sorry.
I'm just out for my morning stroll.

806
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:30,565
I noticed when the postman
put the mail in,

807
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:33,405
the postcard from your
in-laws in the Philippines.

808
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:34,136
Oh.

809
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:37,146
It's nice to see things
are going well for them.

810
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:39,443
Thank you.

811
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:45,489
Yeah, you know, normally I'm not one
to pry into other people's affairs.

812
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,955
No, of course not.

813
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:51,188
I thought you should know,
the other night I was taking a walk,

814
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:54,264
and um, minding my own business,
of course...

815
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:55,730
Of course.

816
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,994
I thought I saw
Julie through the window.

817
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:00,036
With the Cheeseman boy.

818
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:01,628
And?

819
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:03,900
He's not a member of the Church.

820
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:04,804
Ah.

821
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:07,036
Who knows what his values are.

822
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:09,204
I mean, to encourage them
to socialize.

823
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:10,575
I mean really.

824
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:14,481
Well, I thought that you
and your husband,

825
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,644
with him being in a position
of leadership,

826
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:20,588
would want to set the standard
for the community, you know.

827
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:23,251
You know what, Louise?
We are setting a standard.

828
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,352
We had the Cheesemans
over for dinner.

829
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:27,055
It's called "friendshipping."

830
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:30,134
You know what?
You should try it sometime.

831
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,702
- I see.
- Hmmm, I hope so.

832
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,374
Patricia?

833
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:45,380
Yeah, it's Louise.

834
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:47,774
The end of your
first big day.

835
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:49,079
Bringin' home the bacon.

836
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:52,356
My old man used to say success comes

837
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,517
in a pair of overalls
and works eight hours a day.

838
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:58,652
It feels good.
Do you feel that?

839
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,322
- It feels good.
- Yeah.

840
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,865
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

841
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:08,899
Eight hours a day,
forty hours a week!

842
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:15,206
How do you people do it?

843
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:16,541
Huh?

844
00:42:58,789 --> 00:42:59,778
Good afternoon, ma'am.

845
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:01,152
I'm looking for the owner.

846
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:03,227
Yes, I'm the owner,
Francis Eastlack.

847
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:06,558
Mrs. Eastlack, I'm Brigham Smith
from Scrapbookers Local 327.

848
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:08,359
- From where?
- Scrapbookers 327.

849
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:10,491
It's the local scrapbooking union.

850
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,296
I didn't know
scrapbookers had a union.

851
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:13,427
Well, you're supposed to.

852
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:16,005
You're also supposed
to pay your union dues.

853
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:16,869
Union dues?

854
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:17,998
Yes, ma'am.

855
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:19,940
How many employees do you have?

856
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:21,443
Six.

857
00:43:21,545 --> 00:43:24,639
Two full time and four part-time.

858
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:28,344
Well, as you know,
it's $50 a month per person.

859
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:29,453
That's for the full-timers.

860
00:43:29,553 --> 00:43:31,544
For part-timers
we have to charge double dues

861
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,281
because we find that they exert

862
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:36,393
a bigger suck on the pension
and health programs.

863
00:43:36,494 --> 00:43:39,395
So, that's two workers
at $50 a month,

864
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:41,863
four at a $100 a month.

865
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:44,457
That's $500 a month
you have to pay.

866
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:46,331
- I have to pay?
- Yes, ma'am.

867
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:48,598
I thought employees paid
for things like that.

868
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:50,503
What kind of money
do employees make?

869
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:51,666
Minimum wage.

870
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:54,370
And it looks like you're doing
pretty well here.

871
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:55,809
It's a beautiful store.

872
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:56,436
Well, yes.

873
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:57,878
That's why you're responsible.

874
00:43:57,982 --> 00:43:59,244
Let's talk about back dues.

875
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:01,681
Now, unfortunately,
I'm not able to wipe out

876
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:03,684
an entire 12-month period
of back dues.

877
00:44:03,788 --> 00:44:07,417
However, what I can do is
I can only go back three months.

878
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:11,621
So, that's this month
plus three months of back dues.

879
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:13,993
That would be $2,000
you have to pay.

880
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:15,429
That's a lot of money!

881
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:18,161
Is it Mrs. Eastlack?
Is it really?

882
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:20,362
Don't you think it's
in everyone's best interest?

883
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:22,962
You wouldn't want
a strike now, would you?

884
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:23,802
Strike?

885
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:24,932
Oh yes, ma'am.

886
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:28,637
Your employees parading
up and down that beautiful sidewalk,

887
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:30,236
carrying large signs,
and screaming

888
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,873
about how unfairly
they're being treated.

889
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:34,008
We are very fair.

890
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:34,810
Exactly.

891
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:37,512
That's why you have
to pay the $2,000.

892
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:41,948
Well, will you take
a check?

893
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:45,256
Do you have a driver's license
and a major credit card?

894
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:49,165
What can I get you?

895
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:53,961
Yeah, could I get a pound
of your capicola?

896
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:55,595
I'm sorry?

897
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:57,606
Capicola.

898
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,107
Produce section is back there.

899
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,906
It's not produce; it's ham.

900
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:03,037
We have boiled ham.

901
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:06,116
I don't want boiled ham.
I want capicola ham.

902
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,186
Hey, uh... do we have any uh...
cappuccino ham?

903
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:11,413
Capicola!

904
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:12,920
Yeah, that.

905
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:14,457
It's a ham.

906
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,018
We have boiled ham.

907
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:20,564
I don't want boiled ham.
I want cap... never mind.

908
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:28,399
Oh great! Name brand.

909
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:30,064
What is this, detergent?

910
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:31,937
What happened to the Pop-Tarts?

911
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:38,373
Hey, Kate.

912
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,916
Linda.

913
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,079
Hi.

914
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:46,189
Are you okay?

915
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:47,051
Oh, hi.

916
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:50,753
No. It's nuthin'.
I'm fine. Honestly.

917
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:54,695
Oh, honey.
Honey, what is it?

918
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:57,029
Back home I had my friends
and family.

919
00:45:57,134 --> 00:46:00,069
Out here I got nuthin'.
Not even good meat.

920
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,071
Oh, sweetie.

921
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:04,971
But you've got
a wonderful husband and son.

922
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:06,566
My husband?

923
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:08,372
He's more like
that college roommate

924
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,107
when you couldn't wait
for the end of the semester

925
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:12,477
so everybody could move out.

926
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,881
Except with him
I ain't never graduatin'.

927
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:17,214
Oh, hey.

928
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:18,912
Thank you.

929
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:20,523
Oh.

930
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:23,252
You people are so nice.

931
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,555
There's such
a good feelin' about you.

932
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:33,496
Look, Linda, would you like to come
to church with us on Sunday?

933
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:37,174
I mean, just come out
and meet a few more people.

934
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:40,732
You could make new friends.

935
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:43,245
- Yeah.
- Okay.

936
00:46:44,582 --> 00:46:45,446
He hit someone.

937
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:48,677
Uh-huh. So what?
It's wrestling.

938
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:50,377
Yeah, I know it's not fighting.

939
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:51,715
Wink, wink, nod, nod.

940
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:53,721
I get that, all right.

941
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:55,792
What do you mean, "No I don't"?

942
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:58,384
You callin' me stupid?

943
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:02,660
You know, I may drive a minivan,
it's short, but it ain't yellow.

944
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:04,290
Who was that?

945
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:06,266
The high school vice principal.

946
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,337
What's his problem?

947
00:47:07,438 --> 00:47:10,134
Eh, he's upset
that he's only number two.

948
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:13,267
You know, Buzz Aldrin
never got over it either.

949
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:16,175
Oh, and your kid
hit some other kid.

950
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,212
I don't know.

951
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:17,837
What?

952
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:19,176
It was wrestling tryouts.

953
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:20,874
Oh, did he make the team?

954
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:23,714
I'll get the update from him
when he gets home.

955
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:26,186
So you know,
Michael and Kate Jaymes invited us

956
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,985
to go to church Sunday.

957
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:30,219
What?
I don't go to my own church.

958
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:31,851
I'm gonna go to somebody else's?

959
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:33,361
It's not like we're gonna convert.

960
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:36,297
This is a different world.
I would like to know people.

961
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,563
I'm sure they are curious
about who we are.

962
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,798
Who are you talking about,
neighbors or the extraterrestrials?

963
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:44,374
Carmine Zindeli Pasquale,

964
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:46,966
this Sunday you are
gonna get dressed,

965
00:47:47,077 --> 00:47:49,511
your son is gonna get dressed,

966
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:53,071
and we are goin' to church
like a happy, normal family.

967
00:47:54,385 --> 00:47:55,044
Fine.

968
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:02,648
# There is beauty
all around #

969
00:48:02,793 --> 00:48:09,426
# When there's love
at home #

970
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:16,371
# There is joy
in every sound #

971
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:24,972
# When there's love
at home #

972
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:31,646
# Peace and plenty
here abide #

973
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:38,991
# Smiling sweet
on every side #

974
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:47,162
# Time doth softly,
sweetly glide #

975
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:53,699
# When there's love
at home #

976
00:48:53,811 --> 00:49:11,355
# Love at home,
Love at home ##

977
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:18,059
Steve and I are going skiing
Do you want to go with?

978
00:49:18,168 --> 00:49:20,728
Third wheel?
I'll pass.

979
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:23,466
Another fun weekend for me
here in Happy Valley.

980
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:24,939
Just come on.

981
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:30,180
If there was four of us...

982
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:40,587
Kopi Luac?

983
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:41,521
Oh, hey.

984
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,820
Yeah, it's this special coffee
my dad likes.

985
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:47,556
He wanted me to order it.
He's a freak about this stuff.

986
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:49,530
He grinds his own coffee beans.

987
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,157
- Wow!
- Yeah.

988
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:52,895
What happened to you yesterday?

989
00:49:53,003 --> 00:49:55,563
Yeah, Kate told me.
You guys came to church?

990
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:57,072
Uh-huh.

991
00:49:57,174 --> 00:50:00,575
I faked a massive stomachache.
Sorry you had to suffer through it.

992
00:50:00,678 --> 00:50:03,613
No, everyone was real nice.
I kinda liked it.

993
00:50:03,714 --> 00:50:04,806
You're kidding me.

994
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:05,609
It was cool.

995
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:08,207
Your brother asked me to
a paintball thing

996
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,980
the guys from church
are having in the mountains.

997
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:13,089
I'm gonna go.

998
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:14,622
Great.

999
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:17,590
Let's go guys.
Manja.

1000
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:24,261
- Is this my package?
- It came today.

1001
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:26,859
And this is the first I'm hearin'?

1002
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,700
What, are you that desperate
for a coffee fix?

1003
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:37,480
Pineapple?
Pineapple?

1004
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:39,378
Who puts pineapple on a pizza?

1005
00:50:39,483 --> 00:50:40,745
Canadian bacon and pineapple.

1006
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:42,112
It's very popular here.

1007
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:43,480
Folks said to try it.

1008
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,589
You don't put pineapple
on a pizza!

1009
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,749
It's like putting pepperoni
in a fruit cocktail!

1010
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:50,917
It's something you don't do!

1011
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:53,258
I wanted to try something new.

1012
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:55,093
I though we were havin' manicotti.

1013
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,292
I needed something easy,
I'm goin' out tonight.

1014
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:59,232
There's a women's night
at the church.

1015
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,600
- What church?
- The Mormon Church.

1016
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:04,037
With the Mormon Church?
You were there Sunday.

1017
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:05,369
So?
There's something tonight.

1018
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:07,376
Kate invited me.

1019
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:09,234
...Fruit on pizza?

1020
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:11,314
What, you gonna be a Mormon now?

1021
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:14,873
No, but now I have friends.
It's nice to socialize.

1022
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:16,509
With them?
With June Cleaver?

1023
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,518
It's Nick at Night
with these people.

1024
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:19,953
And what's wrong with that?

1025
00:51:20,057 --> 00:51:22,389
They have values!

1026
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:24,427
Hey, take those off.

1027
00:51:24,528 --> 00:51:26,120
Leave the kid alone, will you?

1028
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,131
It would be nice to have
some dinner conversation.

1029
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:30,598
He's got nothing to say!

1030
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:33,534
You got something to say?

1031
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:36,197
Bop! Nuthin'!

1032
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:37,432
Some guys from Church

1033
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,873
are havin' this paintball thing
in the mountains.

1034
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:41,342
Kids your age?

1035
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:42,309
It's the guys.

1036
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:44,005
It's some father and sons.

1037
00:51:44,114 --> 00:51:46,105
Michael asked if we wanted to go.

1038
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:48,207
You have got to be kidding me.

1039
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:50,115
You wanna go runnin'
in the mountains

1040
00:51:50,254 --> 00:51:52,017
playin' Hide and Seek
with Mormons?

1041
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:53,180
What's the matter?

1042
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:55,848
It would be nice,
yous getting together

1043
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:58,086
and doin' something fun
like that.

1044
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:00,686
Why do I wanna go?
I got a house.

1045
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:02,288
It's freezing cold outside.

1046
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:04,026
I'm not goin'.

1047
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:05,624
That happened with the Donner Party.

1048
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:07,135
Them people... they froze.

1049
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:09,637
They ended up putting themselves
on their own pizza.

1050
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,173
You know what, this is...

1051
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:12,299
I'm outta here.

1052
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:13,068
Forget it.

1053
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,611
I'm gonna go get
something to eat somewhere else,

1054
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:17,077
and not in the woods.

1055
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:29,256
Let me get this straight.

1056
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,418
You're telling me
you are the largest

1057
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:34,258
wholesale distributor
of scrapbooking materials

1058
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:36,195
in the entire state of Utah?

1059
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,631
And most of Idaho.

1060
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:39,895
No kiddin'.

1061
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:41,527
Where you were from again?

1062
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:43,833
Save All Memories
of the Children.

1063
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:44,703
What is that?

1064
00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:46,537
You heard of "Save the Children?"

1065
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:48,372
Well, we save all the memories.

1066
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:50,572
What our organization does,
in a nutshell,

1067
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:51,613
is we raise money

1068
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:54,377
for underprivileged children
all around the globe,

1069
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,486
so that they can keep
a scrapbook.

1070
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,918
These little tikes,
they're gonna grow up,

1071
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:01,616
they're gonna' become doctors
and lawyers and such,

1072
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:02,692
and with these scrapbooks,

1073
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:05,158
they're gonna be able to refer back

1074
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:07,093
and see how far they've come.

1075
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:08,289
That's very considerate.

1076
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:09,365
I agree.

1077
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:12,094
How else we gonna know
about these kids?

1078
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:13,100
You've seen them.

1079
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:16,195
It's truly sad,
with the bloated bellies

1080
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:18,171
and the flies flyin' around them.

1081
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:21,335
How we gonna know bout 'em
if there ain't someone there

1082
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:24,710
takin' pictures
while the flies are buzzin'?

1083
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:27,249
We'd be more than happy
to donate scrapbooking materials.

1084
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:29,443
I appreciate that; I really do.

1085
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:32,077
Thing is, we already got us
a government contract

1086
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:34,747
to purchase
the scrapbookin' supplies.

1087
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:36,553
All we're looking for
quite frankly,

1088
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,356
and there ain't no way
to sugarcoat it,

1089
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:41,397
is financial donations.

1090
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:43,056
It's for the children.

1091
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:48,599
Yeah, Salt Lake City
to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

1092
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:52,908
This Friday.

1093
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:57,113
Do ya got something
in the morning?

1094
00:53:57,214 --> 00:53:58,579
I'll take that.

1095
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:00,450
First class.

1096
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:04,976
One seat.

1097
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:08,685
And, no.
One way.

1098
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:12,157
Yes.

1099
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:16,198
You know, Rick, after dinner
we'll check out

1100
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,995
the paintballing equipment
if you'd like.

1101
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:18,692
Hey, thanks.

1102
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:21,100
And thanks for letting me stay
for dinner.

1103
00:54:21,204 --> 00:54:22,831
Oh, it's our pleasure.

1104
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,000
But shouldn't you call your parents
so they know you're here?

1105
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:27,371
Oh no, that's fine.

1106
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,069
They got into another fight.

1107
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:32,478
Dad took off and Mom drank
a whole bottle of white zinfandel.

1108
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,778
She's facedown,
you know, wasted.

1109
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:36,715
So this works out fine.

1110
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:41,119
So you ever actually played
paintball before, Rick?

1111
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:42,884
Oh, no.

1112
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:44,051
Really?

1113
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:45,219
Not everyone's Rambo.

1114
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:48,492
Some people lead
civilized lives indoors.

1115
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,694
It's a shame your dad
couldn't make it with us.

1116
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:55,897
He told me about
his doctor's appointment.

1117
00:54:56,006 --> 00:54:57,735
He told you he had an appointment?

1118
00:54:57,841 --> 00:55:00,605
Yeah, that's why he won't
be coming paintballing with us.

1119
00:55:04,147 --> 00:55:06,707
I thought this was going
to stay in the family,

1120
00:55:06,817 --> 00:55:09,786
but I guess we can confide in you.

1121
00:55:09,886 --> 00:55:11,854
Why, what's wrong?

1122
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:15,413
Well, Dad... Dad's got
to get a colonoscopy.

1123
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:17,254
Oooh, wow!

1124
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:19,386
- What's a colonoscopy?
- Look on the Internet.

1125
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:20,895
No, no, no, no.

1126
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:23,330
It's just
a doctor's appointment, honey.

1127
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,731
Look Rick,
I don't want you to worry.

1128
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:26,928
It's probably nothing,
really.

1129
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:29,767
I had an uncle;
he had a colonoscopy.

1130
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:31,431
It was a buffalo head nickel

1131
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:34,271
that he'd swallowed
when he was two years old.

1132
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:38,508
They got it back too.
Mint condition.

1133
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:40,173
Thing tripled in value.

1134
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:43,779
There isn't a paintballing
merit badge yet,

1135
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,512
but some are working on it.

1136
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:48,090
I like to use this space
to practice.

1137
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:49,488
We'll set up targets.

1138
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:52,323
Have you ever actually
shot a gun before, Rick?

1139
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:54,624
- Well, uh...
- Well, it's pretty easy.

1140
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:56,562
Use the rifleman approach...
the Chuck Connors.

1141
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:57,861
Keen-haw, keen-haw.

1142
00:55:57,968 --> 00:55:58,957
I like that.

1143
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:02,129
Some prefer sort of the delicate
Princess Leah sort of a feel.

1144
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:04,707
You know what I mean?

1145
00:56:04,808 --> 00:56:06,275
You're right.
That's pretty cool.

1146
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:08,003
Look at that, yeah.

1147
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:10,409
I was thinking of having
that painted soon.

1148
00:56:10,514 --> 00:56:13,108
I'll put up some targets
to shoot at.

1149
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,308
How bout that?

1150
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:15,782
Hey, it's pretty fun.

1151
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:18,719
Ahhh!

1152
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:22,019
Julie.

1153
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:24,150
Yeah, you're right.
That was fun.

1154
00:56:24,261 --> 00:56:25,455
Yeah.

1155
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:31,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

1156
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:33,096
What's your problem?

1157
00:56:33,203 --> 00:56:35,637
You've been acting
weird all day.

1158
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:37,366
My problem is when friends come

1159
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:39,738
and spend the night
hanging out with my brother.

1160
00:56:39,843 --> 00:56:41,743
So? You was hangin' out too.

1161
00:56:41,845 --> 00:56:43,039
A good time

1162
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:45,410
is not to hang out
with my brother.

1163
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:47,039
I had a good time.

1164
00:56:47,184 --> 00:56:50,585
If a good time is hangin' out
with my brother, you've got problems.

1165
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,655
You said you had the problem.

1166
00:56:52,756 --> 00:56:54,815
- I did.
- Shhh.

1167
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:56,892
Look, my brother
is a complete dork.

1168
00:56:56,993 --> 00:56:59,484
And his wife is this little
homemaking Nazi.

1169
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:01,723
Your brother and wife
are good people,

1170
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:04,266
and probably your mom
and dad too.

1171
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:06,426
You want nuthin' to do with them?

1172
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:09,198
That's another problem
you got.

1173
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:11,672
Technically, that's just
an extension of the problem.

1174
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:14,209
Shhh!

1175
00:57:14,311 --> 00:57:16,336
Well, then you got one
really big problem.

1176
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:24,080
All right,
I'm goin' to lunch.

1177
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:27,852
Hello.

1178
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:30,051
George, it's Special Agent Tuttle.

1179
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,355
Hey, how you doin'?

1180
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:35,693
[Faking bad phone connection]

1181
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:39,899
- We need to talk.
- Come on.

1182
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:41,402
I just started lunch hour.

1183
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:42,437
That's perfect.
Let's go.

1184
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:45,667
Is your car parked out front?

1185
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:52,642
All right, fine!

1186
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:53,306
Fine!

1187
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:56,010
I did the scrapbooking thing.
Big deal!

1188
00:57:56,153 --> 00:57:58,713
You're doing scrapbooking?
See, that is so cool.

1189
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:00,846
This going straight thing
has worked for you.

1190
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:03,755
It's opened up a myriad
of hobbies and interests.

1191
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,919
When I got married,
we started scrapbooking.

1192
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:08,520
Then we took scrapbooking
and combined it with genealogy

1193
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:09,462
and made books...

1194
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:11,193
La, la, la, la, la.

1195
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:13,997
You see this?
This is my "don't care" face.

1196
00:58:14,104 --> 00:58:16,504
Now, we're not here
for the scrapbooking thing?

1197
00:58:16,606 --> 00:58:18,767
What are you doin' here then?

1198
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:19,773
All right.

1199
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:23,312
Agents in Atlantic City
collared a Rocky Delfurio

1200
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:24,937
on a calling card scam.

1201
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:25,980
Do you know him?

1202
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,413
Yeah, he's like,

1203
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:29,519
he's an old-timer
with Gagliano's crew, right?

1204
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:30,381
Right.

1205
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,148
He wanted to cut a deal
in exchange for information.

1206
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:34,780
Everybody's a stool pigeon.

1207
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:37,894
He actually had
a lot to offer, George.

1208
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:40,929
He lead investigators
to an area in the Pine Barrens.

1209
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:43,090
There were an old farm and well,

1210
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,031
it had been dried up for years.

1211
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:48,104
There was a concrete slab
placed over the top of it.

1212
00:58:48,205 --> 00:58:51,641
It was at the bottom
of the well...

1213
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:54,539
they found the remains
of your father.

1214
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:57,374
I'm so sorry, George.

1215
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,645
At the time your father was involved
in some importing operation.

1216
00:59:02,786 --> 00:59:05,220
A guy named Jimmy lanucci
tried to muscle in.

1217
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:07,017
Your father and lanucci
had some words,

1218
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:08,715
and one thing lead to another.

1219
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:12,386
Lanucci's been doing a 12 to 15
on another wrap in Tallahassee.

1220
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:17,262
He's up for parole in six months
but he's not going anywhere now.

1221
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:21,030
The office sent me all

1222
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:23,537
of your father's
personal effects to give you.

1223
00:59:27,043 --> 00:59:32,345
There's a gold necklace
with a gold crucifix.

1224
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:37,818
A gold ring.

1225
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:42,255
A gold chain with a squiggly thing.

1226
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:47,019
A money clip, no money.

1227
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,358
Gold, though.

1228
00:59:48,465 --> 00:59:52,834
A gold watch.

1229
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:55,564
Gold bracelets.

1230
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:58,971
Something else gold,
I don't know what that is.

1231
00:59:59,075 --> 01:00:00,474
Your father's billfold

1232
01:00:00,577 --> 01:00:02,374
with driver's license
and credit cards.

1233
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:07,007
And a travel brochure
to Disneyland

1234
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:17,925
with three plane tickets
to Los Angeles.

1235
01:00:28,305 --> 01:00:30,239
There you go.

1236
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,808
Thanks.

1237
01:00:33,243 --> 01:00:36,371
So you got that doctor's appointment
this weekend?

1238
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:38,908
Uh, yeah.

1239
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:43,714
You know, I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about, really.

1240
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:46,947
Rick, he told me everything.
He's concerned.

1241
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,352
What are you talking about?

1242
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,392
Look, I know
it's a sensitive subject,

1243
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:53,121
and I want you to know
I feel for you.

1244
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:55,288
I had an uncle
who had a colonoscopy.

1245
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:56,797
So?

1246
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,097
Look, I want you to know
if anything unusual comes up

1247
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:02,171
that we are here for you.

1248
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:05,036
Look.
I'm not having a colonoscopy.

1249
01:01:05,141 --> 01:01:05,732
You're not?

1250
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:08,003
No.

1251
01:01:08,478 --> 01:01:11,675
You know, George, you're over 40.
I mean, this is the time...

1252
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:13,942
We are not having
this discussion!

1253
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:18,253
Ignoring the situation
isn't going to make it actually...

1254
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,724
You know what,
I'm sure your doctor...

1255
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:24,794
All right, you know what?
I lied.

1256
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:25,861
I made it up.

1257
01:01:25,996 --> 01:01:28,556
I got no doctor's appointment,
no colonoscopy, nuthin'.

1258
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:31,259
I made it up so I wouldn't have to go

1259
01:01:31,368 --> 01:01:33,962
out with you into the woods
to play army patrol.

1260
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:36,095
Happy?

1261
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:38,766
Okay.

1262
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:41,040
You know, Rick is really excited.

1263
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:43,203
Let me ask you a question.

1264
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:47,340
Why do you care about me
and my family, huh?

1265
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:48,246
What is your...

1266
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:51,320
You get me this job,
you bring me to church,

1267
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:52,752
you invite us to dinner,

1268
01:01:52,856 --> 01:01:55,154
and now you inviting me
into the woods.

1269
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:56,555
What, you need more converts?

1270
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:58,820
There aren't enough Mormons
in this state?

1271
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:01,692
No, no, George, it's not anything
like that, really.

1272
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:03,993
I just... I consider you a friend.

1273
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,965
I want you to feel like part...

1274
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:07,900
Oh no, I do.
I do.

1275
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:09,266
Every time we go walkin'

1276
01:02:09,372 --> 01:02:11,363
people close their drapes
when they see us.

1277
01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:12,532
Part of the community?

1278
01:02:12,642 --> 01:02:13,836
Ah, see, you know,

1279
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:15,877
there's a saying
about Mormons by Mormons,

1280
01:02:15,979 --> 01:02:18,777
and it says
that the Church is true,

1281
01:02:18,882 --> 01:02:20,873
the people aren't... necessarily.

1282
01:02:20,984 --> 01:02:22,246
And what does that mean?

1283
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:25,252
.
.

1284
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:27,220
But I suppose you think
you're great?

1285
01:02:27,323 --> 01:02:30,053
No, George, I don't think
anything about myself.

1286
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:30,819
I'm sorry.

1287
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:34,920
I just... I just happen to think
that you're a great guy.

1288
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:39,297
You have a great family,
and I want you to feel happy here.

1289
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:40,664
That's all.

1290
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:17,235
Five.

1291
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,466
We're going in!

1292
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:20,042
Put your bike down!

1293
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:23,579
In an approved parking place!

1294
01:03:39,562 --> 01:03:43,328
The guy said I should test drive
this thing before this weekend.

1295
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:44,331
So you're going?

1296
01:03:44,434 --> 01:03:48,495
Yeah. I got you one too.
Give it a shot.

1297
01:03:48,605 --> 01:03:50,630
- All right.
- There's a safety on it.

1298
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,968
- Right here.
- Here?

1299
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:53,167
Push that button.

1300
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:54,004
All right.

1301
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,839
- Show me what you got.
- Just go?

1302
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:57,207
Go!

1303
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:05,911
What's all this?

1304
01:04:06,055 --> 01:04:08,956
You look like Darth Vader
and G.I. Joe had a kid.

1305
01:04:09,058 --> 01:04:11,288
Hey, Dad's going paintballing too!

1306
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:14,227
Really? That's good to hear.

1307
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:20,364
You know what?
It's gonna be cold.

1308
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:23,837
- You know how to start a fire?
- I set a few.

1309
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,376
Just to be safe, get that thermos
and fill it up with gas.

1310
01:04:27,477 --> 01:04:28,671
Okay.

1311
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:36,385
Hey, how you doin'?

1312
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:37,508
Oh, hey.

1313
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:38,643
We're the missionaries from

1314
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:40,915
The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints.

1315
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:44,620
Got it.

1316
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,820
Who were those people
you were talking to?

1317
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,398
Oh, that was
the Mormon missionaries.

1318
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:50,227
Are you kiddin'?

1319
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,824
Who are they preachin' to?
Everyone's already Mormon.

1320
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:54,233
We're not.

1321
01:04:54,337 --> 01:04:56,601
They're gonna be comin' here,
talking to us?

1322
01:04:56,706 --> 01:04:58,173
No, I took care of it.

1323
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:00,902
I told them
this wasn't where I lived.

1324
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,774
I gave them another address
to someplace else.

1325
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,609
I love it.

1326
01:05:12,155 --> 01:05:13,713
Okay guys. Okay guys.
Listen up.

1327
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:16,086
You got your teams.
You know the rules.

1328
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,855
First team to get the other team's
flag and brings it home wins.

1329
01:05:19,963 --> 01:05:20,691
Let's move.

1330
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:21,821
All right, let's go.

1331
01:05:21,931 --> 01:05:24,900
Hey, I gotta go to the bathroom
before we get started.

1332
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:28,368
- All right. Take care of it.
- Well, where'd you put it?

1333
01:05:28,471 --> 01:05:30,632
Are you kiddin' me?
It's pretty much anywhere.

1334
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,265
I mean as long as it's
away from camp.

1335
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:34,934
No, no... you're not hearing me.

1336
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:38,411
It's morning time.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1337
01:05:38,514 --> 01:05:42,746
Anywhere you want.
Just keep it away from camp.

1338
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:47,288
Oh! I got a fire in the hole here!

1339
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,756
All right! They're your woods.

1340
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:00,287
Wherever I want.

1341
01:07:00,363 --> 01:07:02,126
Wherever I want.

1342
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:04,096
I want four walls, a newspaper,

1343
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:06,861
and my toilet seat that plays
"That's Amore."

1344
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:08,732
That's what I want.

1345
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:10,965
Aw! Who clipped you guys?

1346
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:14,305
I don't know.
It was a blur.

1347
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:15,672
Never even heard it comin'.

1348
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:17,177
You must have seen it.

1349
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,510
This act does not go unpunished.

1350
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:21,810
Give me a name.
Give me the name!

1351
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:24,943
I'm hazy.

1352
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:27,921
- Give me the name.
- Robby.

1353
01:07:28,024 --> 01:07:30,515
You're a good kid.
Let's go.

1354
01:07:34,097 --> 01:07:35,758
Why're you cryin' kid?

1355
01:07:35,865 --> 01:07:38,663
Because I want to keep playing.

1356
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:40,167
What's your name?

1357
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:41,896
Robby.

1358
01:07:42,004 --> 01:07:44,131
Robby, huh?

1359
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,233
If I wanted to shoot you Robby,
you'd be dead already, right?

1360
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:51,210
That's a nice gun you got.

1361
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:55,206
What is this?

1362
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:56,818
Granola.

1363
01:07:58,688 --> 01:07:59,916
Granola?

1364
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:01,045
You're a kid.

1365
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:04,489
You should be eating candy
and popcorn and crap.

1366
01:08:07,997 --> 01:08:11,262
I like it though;
I like the granola.

1367
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:17,539
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm not gonna shoot you.

1368
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,108
But you tell us
where your home base is

1369
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:22,370
so we can capture
your flag and win.

1370
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:24,743
It's the other side of the hill.

1371
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:26,439
Don't lie to me kid!

1372
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:27,607
I'm not lying.

1373
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,082
My sixth sense tells me
when people are lying,

1374
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:32,187
especially little kids!

1375
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:36,690
I'm gonna ask you one more time!
Where is your home base?

1376
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:38,488
I'm not lying.

1377
01:08:38,594 --> 01:08:39,390
All right.

1378
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:41,258
I'm gonna shoot you.
Your day's over.

1379
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:44,891
Okay, it's on the other side
of the stream down by the cliffs.

1380
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:46,696
Okay.
Good.

1381
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:50,571
Don't be stupid.

1382
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:53,839
Ah, man!
Now I can't keep playing.

1383
01:08:53,943 --> 01:08:55,069
Yeah.
That's the point.

1384
01:08:55,178 --> 01:08:58,341
But, I didn't shoot you, did I?
Let's go.

1385
01:08:58,448 --> 01:09:00,348
Hey, what should I do with this?

1386
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:02,542
Leave the gun;
take the granola.

1387
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:08,557
Punk.

1388
01:09:37,553 --> 01:09:38,485
You have fun?

1389
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:40,146
Yeah, I did.
It was great.

1390
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:41,381
It was fun, huh?

1391
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:44,925
Did you see me drinkin' coffee
so the Mormons wouldn't see me?

1392
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:46,995
Yeah, that's not all you was doin'.

1393
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:48,495
See that kid?

1394
01:09:48,598 --> 01:09:51,431
Comes around the big boulder
and sees me squattin' there?

1395
01:09:51,534 --> 01:09:53,024
The look on his face.

1396
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:54,363
I love it.

1397
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:57,937
You know what?
I got a good idea.

1398
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,634
Why don't we go home,
get cleaned up,

1399
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:02,506
and take your ma to dinner?

1400
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:03,408
Yeah, where?

1401
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:07,478
Know where I wish we could go?
Naples. Route 45.

1402
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:08,982
Get a big panzorotti.

1403
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:10,549
Baked or fried?

1404
01:10:10,987 --> 01:10:13,080
Who you talking to?
Deep-fried.

1405
01:10:13,222 --> 01:10:13,984
Remember?

1406
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,991
But you know what?
I'll bet nobody's got no Naples,

1407
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:18,993
and nobody knows nuthin'
about no panzorotti.

1408
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:22,124
Isn't that a sports car?

1409
01:10:22,231 --> 01:10:25,758
No. That's a Maserati.
I said panzorotti.

1410
01:10:25,868 --> 01:10:27,096
It's like, picture this.

1411
01:10:27,203 --> 01:10:29,865
Take a pizza, fold it,
throw meat and cheese inside,

1412
01:10:29,972 --> 01:10:31,530
deep fry it, done.

1413
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:33,074
Oh, you mean a calzone?

1414
01:10:33,175 --> 01:10:35,405
No. No.
Look at me.

1415
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:40,346
Does it not look like
I know the difference between
a panzorotti and a calzone?

1416
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:42,383
Maybe I don't know the difference.

1417
01:10:42,518 --> 01:10:43,951
Bingo! Nathan.

1418
01:10:44,053 --> 01:10:45,850
I'll tell you,
today's your lucky day.

1419
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:46,649
You're gonna learn.

1420
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:49,849
Get me an apron; I'll show you
how to make panzorotti.

1421
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:52,222
I'm gonna show you once,
so pay attention.

1422
01:10:52,328 --> 01:10:52,885
All right?

1423
01:10:52,995 --> 01:10:53,484
All right.

1424
01:10:53,596 --> 01:10:56,793
First thing you do,
you turn the dough into crust.

1425
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:59,225
Roll it out nice.
Make a nice ball.

1426
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:01,667
Nice thin crust; that's the key.

1427
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:05,605
Throw in your red sauce,
around the edge, not too much.

1428
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:10,338
You throw in your sausage,
your pepperoni, then your...

1429
01:11:10,446 --> 01:11:11,572
What is this?

1430
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:12,306
A pineapple.

1431
01:11:12,415 --> 01:11:15,248
Pineapple.
Now it's garbage.

1432
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,351
Fold it over.

1433
01:11:19,455 --> 01:11:20,615
You make your seam.

1434
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:24,493
You throw it in your deep fryer.

1435
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:25,924
Nice and brown.

1436
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:27,558
Like that, right?

1437
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:29,528
Then you stuff it in your face.

1438
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:32,692
Yeah, Mike is covered in paint,
and we find the kid.

1439
01:11:32,802 --> 01:11:34,793
Dad makes him tell
where his base is.

1440
01:11:34,904 --> 01:11:37,202
No loyalty, this kid.
Total stool pigeon.

1441
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:40,275
Boo hoo, I just want
to keep playing the game.

1442
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:41,434
He told us everything.

1443
01:11:41,544 --> 01:11:43,444
I would've blasted him right off.

1444
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:45,639
You see?
That's the problem with kids today.

1445
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:47,340
It's all about the violence.

1446
01:11:47,483 --> 01:11:48,450
Be smart.

1447
01:11:48,584 --> 01:11:52,520
True coercion is an art form;
it all starts up here.

1448
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:53,986
So we find the flag,

1449
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,581
we grab it
and start booking it for camp.

1450
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,990
I'm glad you twos
had a good time.

1451
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:00,619
- We did, didn't we?
- Yeah.

1452
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:05,190
Yeah, I was thinking
maybe... spring comes,

1453
01:12:05,301 --> 01:12:07,633
it gets a little warmer
up in the woods,

1454
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:11,036
the three of us, we go,
do like a camping weekend.

1455
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:11,902
For real?

1456
01:12:12,008 --> 01:12:14,568
I don't think so.
You two go.

1457
01:12:14,677 --> 01:12:16,907
I have a house.
Why do I wanna go?

1458
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:18,002
Ah, very funny.

1459
01:12:18,114 --> 01:12:19,513
We'll start out slow.

1460
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:21,810
We'll finish dinner,
go home, open windows,

1461
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:24,442
and we can snuggle up
in the same sleeping bag.

1462
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:26,646
Hey, too much information people.

1463
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:29,758
I'm headin' to the bathroom,
kinda like Dad in the woods.

1464
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,588
- We're not goin' there.
- You already did.

1465
01:12:31,694 --> 01:12:34,720
Um, um! This is so good!

1466
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,422
My compliments to the chef.

1467
01:12:39,502 --> 01:12:40,730
What do you think?

1468
01:12:40,836 --> 01:12:44,431
Tomorrow we get all dressed up
and the three of us,

1469
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:47,100
we go to church together
like a family.

1470
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:48,073
Not for nuthin',

1471
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:50,907
but what's gotten into you,
George Cheeseman?

1472
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:52,480
I don't know.

1473
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:55,709
That's for me to know
and for you to find out.

1474
01:12:56,886 --> 01:13:00,185
Give to your people
the joy of continual health

1475
01:13:00,289 --> 01:13:02,382
in mind and body

1476
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:05,824
with the prayers
of the Virgin Mary to help us.

1477
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:09,762
Guide us through
the sorrows of this life

1478
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:12,732
to eternal happiness
in the life to come.

1479
01:13:13,969 --> 01:13:17,632
I told you it's a hi-tech world,
and we gotta get an IT guy?

1480
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:21,039
The jamook who every time
I got a problem with my computer

1481
01:13:21,143 --> 01:13:23,304
tells me to turn it off and on.

1482
01:13:23,412 --> 01:13:26,210
I get to thinking,
that special coffee

1483
01:13:26,315 --> 01:13:28,306
Carmine always says
he can't live without...

1484
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:29,509
Uh-hmh.

1485
01:13:29,652 --> 01:13:32,143
I get the computer geek
to go on the Internet

1486
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:34,449
and do some research.

1487
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:37,616
There's a half dozen or so
home addresses in the U.S.

1488
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,093
For somebody ordering
that special coffee.

1489
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:44,189
But there's only one out West

1490
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,792
just started ordering the same time
Carmine goes into hiding.

1491
01:13:47,903 --> 01:13:50,531
I want you
to handle this personally.

1492
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:54,509
Already bought the plane tickets.

1493
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,043
I'm goin'.

1494
01:13:56,145 --> 01:13:58,773
And I'm bringin'
Rocco Mancusso with me.

1495
01:13:58,881 --> 01:14:03,079
This time tomorrow,
Carmine Pasquale will be a dead man.

1496
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:12,755
This stuff's pretty good.

1497
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:15,524
I think they call it "fry sauce."

1498
01:14:15,631 --> 01:14:17,360
It tastes like ketchup
and mayonnaise.

1499
01:14:20,069 --> 01:14:22,970
Thought you were on a diet.

1500
01:14:23,072 --> 01:14:24,801
I'm working on it.

1501
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,668
Look at this.
What do we got here?

1502
01:14:27,777 --> 01:14:28,675
What?

1503
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:30,073
There. The van.

1504
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:30,873
It's the wife.

1505
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,038
Look at this.

1506
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:34,911
She must work out.

1507
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:45,660
Oh, look at this.

1508
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:47,490
The groceries;
a nice, happy family.

1509
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:50,924
Not for long.

1510
01:14:52,134 --> 01:14:53,226
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.

1511
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:54,324
You need some help?

1512
01:14:58,274 --> 01:14:59,241
There he is.

1513
01:14:59,341 --> 01:15:00,865
That's him,
that rat fink Carmine Pasquale.

1514
01:15:00,976 --> 01:15:02,068
Come on, let's go.

1515
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:09,540
What, are you nuts?

1516
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:11,250
It's Little Nicky.

1517
01:15:11,353 --> 01:15:12,445
Do you got everything?

1518
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:13,816
CALL THE FEDS!!

1519
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:15,384
He made us.

1520
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:17,049
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

1521
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:18,421
Move over this thing!

1522
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:41,209
- On the left.
- What?

1523
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:42,675
Would you go left?

1524
01:15:42,818 --> 01:15:43,842
All right!

1525
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:45,453
Shut up!
Just shut up!

1526
01:15:45,554 --> 01:15:46,578
Me shut up?

1527
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:48,155
- What are you gonna do?
- Straight.

1528
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:51,055
Well, this is a stroke of genius.
He's just disappeared.

1529
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,151
All these houses look alike to me.

1530
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:54,695
How can we lose 'im?

1531
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:01,860
Right there. Quick, quick!
Make a right.

1532
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:08,934
Rest assured,
you were our last resort.

1533
01:16:10,212 --> 01:16:12,908
Good to see you.
Are Rick and Linda coming?

1534
01:16:13,015 --> 01:16:14,004
No. By myself.

1535
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:16,311
Are you okay?
You seem a little rushed.

1536
01:16:16,452 --> 01:16:16,918
I'm fine.

1537
01:16:17,052 --> 01:16:19,646
Listen, do you have
like a... a basement?

1538
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:22,518
No, no, we have Sunday School,
however, that's starting.

1539
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:25,621
Listen, we also have
a church social next week.

1540
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:40,866
- This is a Mormon church.
- Yeah? So what?

1541
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:43,001
It's supposed to be
some kinda cult.

1542
01:16:43,112 --> 01:16:45,376
What are you talking about "cult"?

1543
01:16:45,481 --> 01:16:48,177
Would you come on?

1544
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:49,045
Hello.

1545
01:16:49,184 --> 01:16:52,051
Are you brethren visiting
with us today?

1546
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:55,248
Uh... yeah, yeah sure.

1547
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:58,053
Good, good, good.
Come on.

1548
01:16:59,061 --> 01:17:01,029
Now, here's our Sunday School class.

1549
01:17:14,476 --> 01:17:17,570
I'd like to welcome everybody out
to Sunday School today.

1550
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,148
Do we have any visitors with us?

1551
01:17:21,317 --> 01:17:22,648
We've seen you here before,

1552
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:26,551
but would you mind standing up
and introducing yourself again?

1553
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,145
I don't want to.

1554
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:31,054
Come on. It's easy.
It's the thing we do.

1555
01:17:33,896 --> 01:17:37,024
I'm George Cheeseman.

1556
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:40,463
George Cheeseman?

1557
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:42,537
Thank you, George.

1558
01:17:42,638 --> 01:17:44,196
And you two brethren back there,

1559
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:46,240
I don't believe
we've met you before.

1560
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:49,306
Go on, please,
introduce yourselves.

1561
01:17:54,750 --> 01:18:00,655
Yeah... my name is uh...
Robert de Niro.

1562
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:04,454
Rocco Mancusso.

1563
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,221
Pleased to meet you.

1564
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:07,693
Nice to have you.

1565
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:12,124
Why didn't you use
a made-up name?

1566
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:13,861
You took mine.

1567
01:18:13,969 --> 01:18:17,700
Okay, lets all turn
to John chapter eight.

1568
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:18,670
You know what?

1569
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:23,040
I left my Bible
in my other church.

1570
01:18:23,946 --> 01:18:25,345
Me too.

1571
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:35,278
Come on.
Open up!

1572
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:37,824
- Give me the keys.
- I don't have the keys.

1573
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:39,450
Oh! There they are.

1574
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:41,188
Where?

1575
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:43,127
They're in the car.

1576
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:46,527
Come on.

1577
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:05,146
We got you now, you rat fink!

1578
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:08,649
Carmine Pasquale, you're a dead man!

1579
01:19:10,826 --> 01:19:11,952
Hey, it's the missionaries.

1580
01:19:12,061 --> 01:19:13,961
Hi, Elders.

1581
01:19:26,608 --> 01:19:29,736
FBI.
Freeze!

1582
01:19:31,847 --> 01:19:33,439
They know where we are now!

1583
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:34,309
George, relax.

1584
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:37,385
We've got them in custody.
They're willing to make a deal.

1585
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:39,681
You see this?
You can't trust nobody.

1586
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:40,584
But it's perfect.

1587
01:19:40,689 --> 01:19:41,986
Now we're spinning a story

1588
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:44,821
that they got picked up
before they got to you,

1589
01:19:44,927 --> 01:19:46,588
and you're completely
unaware of this.

1590
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:49,129
If Angelo thinks he's failed,
he'll send somebody else,

1591
01:19:49,231 --> 01:19:50,755
and that we use as leverage.

1592
01:19:50,866 --> 01:19:52,766
Of course,
he's gonna send somebody else.

1593
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:54,893
What happens when
somebody else gets here?

1594
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:56,300
We are dead!

1595
01:19:56,405 --> 01:19:58,236
George, we're going to protect you.

1596
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,535
Right.

1597
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:02,371
Trust me.

1598
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:06,179
You got this Mormon family,
Catholic family,

1599
01:20:06,281 --> 01:20:07,839
living next door to each other.

1600
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:10,418
So each family has
a little four-year-old kid.

1601
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:13,283
One's a boy; one's a girl.
It's summertime.

1602
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:15,686
The kids are playin';
they turn on the sprinkler.

1603
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:19,056
They figure, "Eh, we'll strip down
to our birthday suits," right?

1604
01:20:19,161 --> 01:20:19,889
They're running around.

1605
01:20:19,995 --> 01:20:21,929
Little boy looks
at little girl and goes,

1606
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,191
"Oh! Look, there really is

1607
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:28,065
a difference between Mormons
and Catholics!"

1608
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,102
All right.

1609
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:31,331
I just got one more thing...
I wanna...

1610
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,668
What are you gonna do?

1611
01:20:32,774 --> 01:20:35,572
Hey, uh, folks,
if I could have your attention.

1612
01:20:35,677 --> 01:20:41,206
Now, I know you don't drink,
or smoke, or have fun.

1613
01:20:41,316 --> 01:20:42,613
Of course, I'm kidding.

1614
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:47,882
But I would like to raise a toast
with my caffeine-free Diet Pepsi

1615
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:51,015
and share with you
an old Italian toast.

1616
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,252
It goes something like:

1617
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:57,196
"Chi trova un amico,
trova un tesoro."

1618
01:20:57,299 --> 01:21:01,463
Which means, "He who finds a friend
finds a treasure."

1619
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:05,904
- Chindan.
- Chindan.

1620
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:08,909
Put your cups down!
That's not appropriate.

1621
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:11,479
For heaven's sakes,
that's the appearance of evil.

1622
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:15,875
Well, uh, thanks for having us guys.
This was great.

1623
01:21:16,018 --> 01:21:17,007
Oh, you're leaving?

1624
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:19,620
Yep, we gotta go.
Saturday night mass.

1625
01:21:19,721 --> 01:21:21,154
Wanna to stay for desert?

1626
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:23,816
I left the ricard pie on the table.
Enjoy.

1627
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:25,392
Oh, thanks for coming.

1628
01:21:28,197 --> 01:21:31,724
Listen, about the other day,
do you think we could talk later?

1629
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:34,324
Um, yeah.
Sure.

1630
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:35,960
Okay.

1631
01:21:36,071 --> 01:21:37,561
Good to have you.

1632
01:21:37,673 --> 01:21:39,834
Yeah, thanks.

1633
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:41,568
You guys take care.

1634
01:21:41,677 --> 01:21:44,407
Yeah, sure.

1635
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:49,015
When in Rome.

1636
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:50,814
See ya.

1637
01:21:51,253 --> 01:21:51,981
See ya, Rick.

1638
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,712
Thanks for comin'.

1639
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:57,725
That was nice.

1640
01:21:57,859 --> 01:21:58,518
Yeah.

1641
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:01,255
Aside from the food,
that was great fun.

1642
01:22:07,002 --> 01:22:10,130
You know, I've never heard a toast
at a church dinner before.

1643
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:11,263
That was a first.

1644
01:22:11,373 --> 01:22:13,307
Well, George is a good guy.

1645
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:15,239
Yeah, they're good people.

1646
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:32,717
According to a spokesman
for the FBI,

1647
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:36,320
notorious mob figure
Carmine "The Beans" Pasquale

1648
01:22:36,431 --> 01:22:38,092
and his family,
known to neighbors

1649
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,930
as George, Linda,
and Patrick Cheeseman,

1650
01:22:41,036 --> 01:22:42,628
were in the
Witness Protection Program

1651
01:22:42,738 --> 01:22:44,330
for just over a month,

1652
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:47,431
when this apparent
mob retaliation took place.

1653
01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:49,134
Investigators say...

1654
01:23:08,563 --> 01:23:11,498
It's all over the news.

1655
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:19,300
Hello.

1656
01:23:20,642 --> 01:23:21,540
President Perry.

1657
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:23,177
Christina?

1658
01:23:23,278 --> 01:23:25,473
I knew there was something
suspicious about them.

1659
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:28,208
What if that explosion had happened
when we were nearby?

1660
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,874
It could have been a tragedy!

1661
01:23:30,652 --> 01:23:31,812
Brothers and sisters,

1662
01:23:31,953 --> 01:23:35,514
I bring you condolences
for this incredible tragedy.

1663
01:23:35,657 --> 01:23:36,715
You knew this family

1664
01:23:36,858 --> 01:23:40,021
and their effort to get
a second start in life,

1665
01:23:40,128 --> 01:23:43,757
and I understand many of you
here embraced them, as you should,

1666
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:45,594
as neighbors.

1667
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:47,464
Now, I have other news.

1668
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:50,663
With Bishop Harrison's recent loss,
he and his family have decided

1669
01:23:50,772 --> 01:23:56,005
to permanently relocate back East
to assist with his parents' farm.

1670
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:59,205
We therefore need to release
Bishop John Clayton Harrison

1671
01:23:59,314 --> 01:24:01,077
as bishop of the Mountain View Ward

1672
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:03,845
with Michael Isaac Jaymes
as first counselor

1673
01:24:03,985 --> 01:24:08,718
and Kepi Vakasiwola Viahani
as second counselor.

1674
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:11,622
Those who can offer
a vote of thanks for their service,

1675
01:24:11,727 --> 01:24:13,957
please join me in doing so.

1676
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:18,456
Would the following individual
please stand;

1677
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:21,058
as I read his name,
we ask for your vote.

1678
01:24:21,169 --> 01:24:23,194
As the bishop
of the Mountain View Ward,

1679
01:24:23,305 --> 01:24:25,205
Michael Isaac Jaymes.

1680
01:24:29,211 --> 01:24:32,203
All those who can accept
Michael Jaymes as your bishop,

1681
01:24:32,314 --> 01:24:33,941
please indicate.

1682
01:24:34,383 --> 01:24:35,907
No, I don't think so pal!

1683
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:36,608
What?

1684
01:24:36,752 --> 01:24:38,879
George, we're trying
to keep a low profile.

1685
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,783
I gotta pay for meals in coach.

1686
01:24:40,889 --> 01:24:44,052
He says I look like I'm goin'
to a Barry Manilow concert.

1687
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,093
George, you're in disguise.
Keep it low-key.

1688
01:24:46,194 --> 01:24:48,219
You could have done better
on these getups.

1689
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,525
It's temporary.
Your plane leaves in 15 minutes.

1690
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:52,265
Okay.

1691
01:24:52,367 --> 01:24:53,231
Now, be assured.

1692
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:55,462
Angelo Marcello thinks you're dead.

1693
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:58,903
I wish I was dead with these clothes.
You have no imagination.

1694
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:00,770
Are you sure
nobody suspects a thing?

1695
01:25:00,876 --> 01:25:01,342
No.

1696
01:25:01,443 --> 01:25:03,570
Everybody has bought this,
including your neighbors.

1697
01:25:03,678 --> 01:25:05,805
We've kept a tight beat
on the community

1698
01:25:05,914 --> 01:25:07,176
and what people are saying.

1699
01:25:07,282 --> 01:25:09,876
You might be interested
to know your friend, Mike Jaymes,

1700
01:25:10,018 --> 01:25:12,009
was called to be
the new bishop today.

1701
01:25:12,154 --> 01:25:13,018
Really?

1702
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:15,089
Well, not for nuthin'.
He's good people.

1703
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:16,418
I can see why.

1704
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:19,790
- Apparently not everybody can.
- What do you mean?

1705
01:25:19,895 --> 01:25:22,455
In the Mormon Church,
when called to any position,

1706
01:25:22,564 --> 01:25:25,055
everybody in the congregation
has to vote on it.

1707
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:29,263
Now, 999 times out of 1000
everybody votes in the affirmative.

1708
01:25:29,371 --> 01:25:31,236
What happens on the 1000th time?

1709
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:34,240
Once in a while people
will vote against it.

1710
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:35,434
So, so what?

1711
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:37,341
Somebody didn't want
to vote for Mike?

1712
01:25:37,446 --> 01:25:39,346
Actually about half
the congregation.

1713
01:25:39,448 --> 01:25:40,506
What?

1714
01:25:40,615 --> 01:25:42,606
I've got to admit,
it's almost unheard of.

1715
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:45,618
How could anyone
have anything bad to say about Mike?

1716
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,188
We're here tonight for you
to voice your concerns.

1717
01:25:48,323 --> 01:25:53,226
I asked Brother Jaymes not to attend
- to allow everyone to speak freely.

1718
01:25:53,328 --> 01:25:55,626
I have known Michael Jaymes
for years.

1719
01:25:55,730 --> 01:26:00,133
We're not going to find anyone
with more dedication.

1720
01:26:00,235 --> 01:26:03,762
You know, I think I speak
for a lot of people here

1721
01:26:03,872 --> 01:26:08,309
when I say he may mean well,
but at what expense?

1722
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:11,277
What if one of us had been killed
because Michael Jaymes

1723
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:14,780
invited a mobster to wander
the halls of our church?

1724
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,316
But he didn't know.

1725
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:18,112
The federal government
sent them here.

1726
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,221
There should be a law against that.

1727
01:26:20,355 --> 01:26:23,324
Or some law notifying us
that these people are moving in.

1728
01:26:23,425 --> 01:26:26,189
It's the
Witness Protection Program!

1729
01:26:26,294 --> 01:26:28,922
If we know they're here,
they're not protected.

1730
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:30,895
Then who is going to protect us?

1731
01:26:30,999 --> 01:26:33,263
That mobster thug
scared my son to death

1732
01:26:33,368 --> 01:26:34,733
and ate his granola!

1733
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:36,531
Exactly.

1734
01:26:36,638 --> 01:26:40,699
Michael Jaymes invited a wolf
into our little flock of sheep.

1735
01:26:41,843 --> 01:26:44,539
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

1736
01:26:50,452 --> 01:26:51,817
Oh!

1737
01:26:54,489 --> 01:26:57,481
Can I, uh, say somethin' here?

1738
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:07,695
Thank you.

1739
01:27:11,406 --> 01:27:13,499
Um, well, we're not dead.

1740
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:19,337
That little magic show
you saw yesterday

1741
01:27:19,447 --> 01:27:21,642
was courtesy of the FBI.

1742
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:27,518
They did it to trick
some people I used to know.

1743
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:30,887
And we're movin' away from here now.

1744
01:27:30,992 --> 01:27:32,516
But the Feds have big ears,

1745
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:37,564
and I heard what was going down here
with uh... with Mike Jaymes

1746
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:41,762
and what some of you think about him,

1747
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:43,360
that you believe he's responsible

1748
01:27:43,471 --> 01:27:46,167
for bringing in a wolf
amongst your sheep.

1749
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:53,473
And my life these days
has been all about

1750
01:27:53,582 --> 01:27:56,574
saving my own skin
and looking out for number one.

1751
01:27:56,718 --> 01:28:00,051
Actually,
my whole life's been that way.

1752
01:28:02,724 --> 01:28:06,820
But I figured when I heard about
this sit-down today,

1753
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:09,362
it's a good opportunity
for me to stand up

1754
01:28:09,464 --> 01:28:12,729
for someone who done right by me.

1755
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:16,868
Someone like Mike.

1756
01:28:17,305 --> 01:28:18,499
So...

1757
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,674
Just relax!

1758
01:28:20,775 --> 01:28:22,640
I just wrote down some notes.

1759
01:28:28,316 --> 01:28:31,945
You know I heard one time
that the Mormon Church is true,

1760
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:34,385
but the people ain't.

1761
01:28:34,489 --> 01:28:37,458
I don't know if the Mormon God
is the one true God.

1762
01:28:37,592 --> 01:28:39,617
I'm not a prayin' man.

1763
01:28:39,728 --> 01:28:42,925
I have heard many people
say their prayers.

1764
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:44,430
But I can tell you,

1765
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:47,262
if there is one ounce
of truth in the Mormon Church

1766
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:51,738
and I relied on the people
in this room to find out about it,

1767
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,738
I'd never know.

1768
01:28:52,841 --> 01:28:57,175
Some of you people wouldn't give
me and my family the time of day.

1769
01:28:57,812 --> 01:29:03,011
That aside, you do have
one good thing going for ya,

1770
01:29:03,151 --> 01:29:04,982
Michael Jaymes.

1771
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,521
That guy cared more about me
and my family than I did.

1772
01:29:11,559 --> 01:29:15,962
And he showed me what's
really important in life.

1773
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,692
If he can do that
with a guy like me,

1774
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,564
imagine what he could do
with people like you.

1775
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:25,272
So, I don't know if it counts,

1776
01:29:27,909 --> 01:29:30,036
but Mike Jaymes has my vote.

1777
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:03,141
Hey!

1778
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,071
What, we need
an engraved invitation?

1779
01:30:07,182 --> 01:30:09,673
I smell dinner;
I don't know about you guys.

1780
01:30:11,586 --> 01:30:14,248
So, the Feds have
their undercover guy.

1781
01:30:14,389 --> 01:30:16,084
He's worked in with Angelo's crew,

1782
01:30:16,191 --> 01:30:18,659
he tells 'em
that what went down was real,

1783
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,125
Angelo believes we're dead.

1784
01:30:20,228 --> 01:30:21,855
So did everyone else.

1785
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:23,521
It had to be that way.

1786
01:30:23,631 --> 01:30:25,861
But when we heard about
what happened...

1787
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:28,527
I hadda come back and say my piece.

1788
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,533
So any idea
where you're heading now?

1789
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:35,267
None.

1790
01:30:35,376 --> 01:30:38,743
As long as they don't put pineapple
on their pizza, I'm fine.

1791
01:30:38,847 --> 01:30:40,212
And good coffee.

1792
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:41,213
I don't know.

1793
01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:43,341
Coffee almost got me killed
this time around.

1794
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:46,750
I'm thinking there's something to
this whole Mormon health code thing.

1795
01:30:48,289 --> 01:30:49,984
- Oh, hey. President.
- Hi.

1796
01:30:50,091 --> 01:30:52,423
- I wanted to tell you.
- What?

1797
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:53,892
Congratulations, Bishop.

1798
01:30:54,562 --> 01:30:56,655
Ha, ha, ha.

1799
01:30:56,765 --> 01:30:58,027
Everybody sustained me?

1800
01:30:58,133 --> 01:30:59,566
No.

1801
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:01,862
But I never said everybody had to.

1802
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,461
All I wanted to know
was why they didn't.

1803
01:31:04,572 --> 01:31:06,631
But you're where
you need to be, Bishop.

1804
01:31:06,741 --> 01:31:08,208
The rest will come around.

1805
01:31:08,309 --> 01:31:11,472
Look at you.
The Mormon Jimmy Hoffa over here!

1806
01:31:11,579 --> 01:31:15,106
If I were you,
just in case you ever disappear,

1807
01:31:15,216 --> 01:31:17,684
leave a note saying
to look for you

1808
01:31:17,786 --> 01:31:19,811
under the goalposts
at the B YU stadium.

1809
01:31:21,456 --> 01:31:22,218
Okay.

1810
01:31:22,323 --> 01:31:23,915
He has no idea.

1811
01:31:26,127 --> 01:31:30,063
I don't know if you can write,
but if you can, here's the address

1812
01:31:30,165 --> 01:31:32,759
to my parents' home
in the Philippines.

1813
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:34,164
Your brother's kickin' you out?

1814
01:31:34,502 --> 01:31:37,869
Nah. I decided I'm going
to live with my parents.

1815
01:31:37,972 --> 01:31:41,339
It's sort of trying to find
a solution to my problems.

1816
01:31:41,442 --> 01:31:43,273
I thought it was a big problem?

1817
01:31:43,378 --> 01:31:45,369
Then it might get a little smaller.

1818
01:31:47,215 --> 01:31:48,648
Oh! Let's go!

1819
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:49,444
I gotta go.

1820
01:31:49,584 --> 01:31:50,812
Come one. Get in.

1821
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:52,180
Thanks for everything.

1822
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,753
Good luck with the baby.

1823
01:31:53,855 --> 01:31:55,846
Thank you.

1824
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:57,821
All right.
Come on, get in.

1825
01:31:57,926 --> 01:31:59,052
Good luck with everything.

1826
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:00,127
Be good.
Be safe.

1827
01:32:00,261 --> 01:32:02,593
You take care of yourself.

1828
01:32:02,697 --> 01:32:04,995
Oh, hey.
One more thing.

1829
01:32:05,099 --> 01:32:07,795
- Mike, could you do me a favor?
- Yeah, sure.

1830
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:10,567
Can you deliver those?

1831
01:32:10,672 --> 01:32:13,505
But, I need you to do it personally.

1832
01:32:13,608 --> 01:32:14,870
What are they?

1833
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,534
Refund checks.

1834
01:32:18,313 --> 01:32:20,975
Thanks.
Aloha, Bishop.

1835
01:32:28,356 --> 01:32:31,018
- See ya.
- Take it easy.

1836
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:32,490
Bye.

1837
01:32:39,868 --> 01:32:40,732
I love these.

1838
01:32:40,835 --> 01:32:43,030
You put the little bubble
on the picture,

1839
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:44,536
like it's a comic strip.

1840
01:32:45,106 --> 01:32:46,539
Oh, that's cute.

1841
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:48,165
How long have you been open?

1842
01:32:48,276 --> 01:32:50,938
My husband and I opened
about a month ago.

1843
01:32:51,045 --> 01:32:51,875
These are great.

1844
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:54,107
Three, four, five,
five is ten.

1845
01:32:54,215 --> 01:32:56,547
Thank you very much.
Come again.

1846
01:32:56,684 --> 01:32:57,776
Bye-bye.

1847
01:32:58,486 --> 01:33:01,148
Ah, Mormon missionaries.

1848
01:33:01,289 --> 01:33:04,087
I tell you what,
here, it's on the house.

1849
01:33:04,192 --> 01:33:05,420
Oh, thanks!

1850
01:33:05,526 --> 01:33:07,756
- Where you from?
- Utah.

1851
01:33:07,862 --> 01:33:10,057
Oh!
Really?

1852
01:33:10,164 --> 01:33:12,223
Looks like you haven't
had a decent meal.

1853
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,461
How bout comin' over
to the house for dinner.

1854
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:17,060
You won't hear complaints from us.

1855
01:33:17,171 --> 01:33:18,798
We won't hear any messages either.

1856
01:33:18,907 --> 01:33:20,374
We're just gonna eat.

1857
01:33:20,475 --> 01:33:21,305
It's a start.

1858
01:33:21,409 --> 01:33:22,307
Forget about it.

1859
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:24,503
I'm Elder Carpenter,
and this is Elder Martin.

1860
01:33:24,612 --> 01:33:25,374
How you doin'?

1861
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,174
I'm Donald Clayton.

1862
01:33:26,281 --> 01:33:28,943
This is son Jordan,
my lovely wife May.

1863
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:30,210
Get me May.

1864
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:32,182
I'm inviting Mormons over...
on purpose.

1865
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,720
- You're kidding!
- I don't know what got into me.

1866
01:33:34,822 --> 01:33:35,982
Give 'em our address,

1867
01:33:36,124 --> 01:33:38,388
and make it the correct one
this time.

1868
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:40,893
- So you guys like Italian food?
- Love it.

1869
01:33:40,995 --> 01:33:42,895
Great.
We're having Chinese.

1870
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:43,520
It's Tuesday.

1871
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:45,394
Tuesday's Chinese food
at our house.

1872
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,491
She makes a great stir fry.

1873
01:33:47,602 --> 01:33:49,035
Mom makes good stir fry.

1874
01:33:49,137 --> 01:33:51,469
- Not better than mine.
- No, she's the best.

1875
01:33:51,572 --> 01:33:54,473
And what she does...
what do you call that thing?

1876
01:33:54,575 --> 01:33:55,507
The big metal...

1877
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:56,577
The wok.

1878
01:33:56,678 --> 01:33:58,339
She shakes it with her whole body.

1879
01:33:58,446 --> 01:34:00,607
It's like watching
a Chinese hula girl.

1880
01:34:00,715 --> 01:34:02,876
No, it's nice,
and the food's delicious!
