-You're making a scene.
-Have you ever seen a shoddier...

1345
01:25:35,413 --> 01:25:37,779
...piece of equipment?
I may be forced to litigate.

1346
01:25:37,949 --> 01:25:41,476
-Move this vehicle or I'm calling the cops.
-I refuse to move an inch, sir...

to come with me.

Oh, my God.

Look, Nora, you were right.

1354
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:00,765
I was an asshole.
I'm sorry about the way I treated you.

1355
01:26:00,939 --> 01:26:03,737
It's just because I liked you so much.

1356
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:06,468
What are you talking about?

1357
01:26:07,478 --> 01:26:12,472
You're smart,
you're intrepid, you're "funky."

Move that piece of shit.
