1
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,619
Help!

2
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:14,723
Hey!

3
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:10,214
Every 23rd year, for 23 days,

4
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:11,850
it gets to eat.

5
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,088
And the things it leaves behind,

6
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:18,043
like the thing it left in
Poho County that night,

7
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:21,626
the nightmare on four wheels,

8
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:24,229
was a horror all its own.

9
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:33,974
Oh.

10
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,008
Go get the sergeant.

11
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,815
Sergeant!

12
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:44,818
Sergeant!

13
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:49,089
We got the truck open.

14
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,879
God.

15
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,616
God-damn slaughterhouse
on wheels.

16
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:18,586
Police scanner.

17
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:22,425
It's been listening to us.

18
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,194
Whatever it is.

19
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:27,763
Some of this stuff,

20
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,566
I don't wanna know what it's made of.

21
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:32,701
Where the hell is that tow truck?

22
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:33,804
100.

23
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:36,305
Coroner's still down in the jail.

24
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
Should I get him up here?

25
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,947
Those are for sawing.

26
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,269
I don't wanna know for what.

27
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,773
Get that god-damn
thing in the impound!

28
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:47,314
Oh my god.

29
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,851
I don't believe it.

30
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,723
Jesus Christ, where
the hell have you been?

31
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:30,459
How many did you lose tonight?

32
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:33,996
You hold it together
and you answer me.

33
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:38,434
Three officers, an
inmate down in the jail.

34
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:40,069
And then the kid.

35
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:42,372
The one he flew off with.

36
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:43,674
Name of Jerry.

37
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:48,445
His name was Jerry Jenner,
his sister's a train-wreck.

38
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:50,158
She's inside waiting
for her folks that are

39
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,215
driving in from Stillwater.

40
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:53,850
Where is the last place you saw it?

41
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:38,064
Don't touch that, and stay back!

42
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,412
Show me.

43
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,589
We threw everything
we had at it, Danny.

44
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:05,660
All the fire and manpower
this building had to offer.

45
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:07,339
And it just made a whole lot of noise

46
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:10,599
and flew off with
exactly what it wanted.

47
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,436
Sheriff, don't you want
us towing that truck?

48
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,005
They just towed it out of here.

49
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:18,240
Oh, no, no, no!

50
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,677
Can't raise them, they're
not answering any frequency.

51
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,857
- Where are they taking it?
- To impound, where else?

52
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,801
Jesus Christ, we couldn't
leave it sitting there!

53
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:26,884
You saw what it did.

54
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:28,829
We gotta get an
armada round that thing.

55
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:29,853
You make it happen, now!

56
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:33,222
Anybody, everybody, get
on out there, move fast!

57
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,258
Just a god-damn minute, Danny.

58
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,494
You tell me how the hell
you know about any of this.

59
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,210
Because what happened
here happened before!

60
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,912
You think that thing
torched that church tonight

61
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:45,169
because it wanted a camp fire?

62
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,071
It was destroying information,

63
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:49,406
trying to get rid of what
it doesn't want us to know.

64
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:50,374
And that truck?

65
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,676
That truck is that
thing's rolling history.

66
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:55,079
Which is why we get it in
the impound and tear it apart.

67
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,347
It ain't gonna make
it to the impound!

68
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,625
Looks like rig up, old Chevy Cabo.

69
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,862
Cabo engine, I'd say 1940s.

70
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,700
That cow-catcher's
gotta be custom.

71
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:17,681
You wanna tell me what
the hell a truck like that

72
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:18,705
needs a cow-catcher for?

73
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:23,909
If you knew what was inside that thing,

74
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,812
that wouldn't be your only question.

75
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:33,385
Code three, you read me?

76
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,422
- Code three!
- Come again, sergeant?

77
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,257
Just tell
that driver to put his foot

78
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,260
on the gas, we're trying like hell...

79
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:56,844
What the hell?

80
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:04,385
- What is that?
- Jesus Christ!

81
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:06,588
Holy shit!

82
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:51,035
Fear has a scent.

83
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:56,307
You can't have seen
that thing and hate it.

84
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,345
Like it could sample fear
right out of the air.

85
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,883
Dispatch, this is Lang
with the impound vehicle.

86
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:05,985
Please respond.

87
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:10,021
That's how it picks
what parts of us to eat.

88
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:11,790
Captain, are you in range?

89
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:13,458
- And it eats...
- This is Dana.

90
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:15,253
We have a situation with
the impound vehicle.

91
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:17,596
To rebuild itself.

92
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:25,805
You hear that?

93
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:28,541
It's coming back.

94
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:54,535
What the...

95
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,781
Stop!

96
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:38,883
Stop!

97
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:40,650
Stop!

98
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,919
Frank!

99
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:45,588
It never hunts in the same place,

100
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:47,391
for more than a day.

101
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:50,261
It's done with Poho County.

102
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:54,065
All we can do now is head north,

103
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,100
and follow the birds.

104
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,472
It's not much, but it's all we know.

105
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:07,446
Ravens and crows, they
travel when it does.

106
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:14,519
Davis, I've looked that
ugly thing eye to eye.

107
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:18,690
23 years ago.

108
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,830
I know it.

109
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,199
And it knows me.

110
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,583
Why do you do this?

111
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,788
It hurts too much seeing you like this.

112
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,224
Mom, just listen, okay?

113
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,029
Time's up, it's coming
back just like I said.

114
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,431
Why?

115
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:00,798
Stop asking, it doesn't matter.

116
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
You.

117
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,702
Tell me why it's coming here.

118
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,572
Pieces of it left behind.

119
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:09,241
They're full of secrets about it.

120
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,444
That's what's buried up here?

121
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,180
- A piece of it?
- There's no more time.

122
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,749
It's coming here and you
can't be here when it does.

123
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:20,119
- How do you know it's coming?
- I'm a part of it now!

124
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:22,254
How many times do I
have to tell you that?

125
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,467
It knows what's buried here,

126
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:24,991
and it will come and take it back.

127
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:26,860
Oh, killing you wasn't enough?

128
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,062
Why didn't it take it 23 years ago?

129
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:30,530
It ran out of time!

130
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:34,601
It always runs out of time,
I can't keep telling you this.

131
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:37,637
If you won't leave to save yourself,

132
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,672
then do it to save Addison.

133
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:41,408
Addison?

134
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:45,946
Addison!

135
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:51,752
You think that we have any money?

136
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:53,935
Kenny, are you listening to yourself?

137
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:56,825
Are you list.

138
00:15:57,493 --> 00:15:59,060
Just pack up and go?

139
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:02,364
Pack up everything,
just leave for where?

140
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:04,699
He knows it's here, Mom,
'cause I'm a part of it,

141
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:05,867
and it's a part of me.

142
00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:07,736
Today, tomorrow or sometime soon,

143
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:09,604
it is gonna walk up this
hill and it is gonna

144
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:13,241
dig this thing up right
where I'm standing.

145
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:18,080
And when it comes, it'll kill
anyone that's still here.

146
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:24,221
Go away, Mom.

147
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:25,889
Now.

148
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,923
Good morning, handsome.

149
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:03,494
Hey, you hungry, buddy?

150
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:10,337
Damn.

151
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,540
Come on.

152
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:18,310
Gotta go talk to Grandma, and
I don't wanna do it alone.

153
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:45,307
Grandma?

154
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:51,279
Are you okay?

155
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:58,085
I'm taking the truck into town.

156
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,025
We need hay.

157
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,561
Who is gonna pay for it?

158
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:10,632
I was thinking maybe we
still had some credit at Hooks?

159
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:12,200
He called again.

160
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:15,637
We owe them more than we can pay.

161
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:19,842
- Cal did say that he...
- Grandma, no.

162
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,744
- Addie.
- I already told you.

163
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:24,247
I'm not selling Rocket, Grandma.

164
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:27,550
Selling him would be like
giving away my own child.

165
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,218
What a good mother
might have to do

166
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,821
so that child wouldn't go hungry.

167
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:36,360
I want you to go
away for a few days.

168
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:40,130
Maybe stay with Gracie.

169
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,000
Why?

170
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,135
Can you?

171
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:51,875
Is there something that
you don't want me here for?

172
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:52,977
Yes.

173
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:01,519
I'm expecting company.

174
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:08,993
You've got your team.

175
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:12,832
You've got experienced
men who know this thing.

176
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,541
Boss.

177
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:23,476
Michael.

178
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,557
This his old man's truck?

179
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,915
It's an old Vulcan cannon.

180
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:04,820
She's amped up to shoot 20mm
rounds, 6,000 rounds a minute.

181
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:07,556
You test this thing?

182
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,959
Mikey.

183
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:12,694
Is this thing tested?

184
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:15,531
This thing throws up a wall of fire.

185
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,399
A wall of fire that
nothing from this world

186
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:19,735
or the next can get through!

187
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,673
Not without being torn
into a million pieces.

188
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,914
She may not fly, but this
is our killing machine.

189
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:39,858
Davis!

190
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:43,394
He watched that thing fly down,

191
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:45,763
and punch a hole in his old man.

192
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:48,899
He stood there and
watched it pull the heart

193
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,367
right out of his daddy's chest,

194
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,604
and swallowed it
right before his eyes.

195
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,142
Miller was only 10 years old.

196
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:02,514
You're not losing your mind, Davis.

197
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:05,350
You just got bloodied last night.

198
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:14,427
Now do you wanna guess how
much blood I got on my hands?

199
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:17,363
You've seen that thing now.

200
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,800
So you got blood
on your hands, too.

201
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:25,104
And no matter what you
do, it's gonna stay there.

202
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:26,906
Whether you walk away,

203
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,209
or not.

204
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:36,183
Rendezvous on station one!

205
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:39,053
North!

206
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:45,158
Can I beg some hay off you?

207
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:46,326
Sure, stranger.

208
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:48,696
Our horses are up in Bolander.

209
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,865
You're not up there with
Rocket winning trophies?

210
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,701
I can't even afford the gas
to drive up there right now.

211
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:55,470
What's the matter?

212
00:21:55,572 --> 00:21:56,572
Your grandma?

213
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,318
Yeah, she was up on the
hill again this morning.

214
00:21:59,342 --> 00:22:00,608
Screaming at the wind?

215
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,076
Calling it Kenny?

216
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:04,546
Didn't he die like 20 years ago?

217
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:05,882
Mom!

218
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,590
You know you got a
rabbit in that trap?

219
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:15,772
That's what it's there for.

220
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:19,495
So it's suffering, are you
just gonna leave it in there?

221
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:20,597
Mom!

222
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,601
Mom, he's got a rabbit in the trap.

223
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,336
Hey, Addie, long time no see.

224
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:28,305
Mom said they were
eating up her garden.

225
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:30,206
I didn't say you should trap them.

226
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,549
- You didn't say I shouldn't.
- How's your grandma doin'?

227
00:22:32,578 --> 00:22:33,858
He doesn't care
about the garden.

228
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,714
He traps them because he
likes killing them, he's sick.

229
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,685
I mean, who likes to trap
and kill things for fun, huh?

230
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:41,619
Psychos, maybe?

231
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:43,241
He's too stupid to
even know he is one.

232
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:46,001
Alright, stop, and you take
care of this before you leave,

233
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:47,992
by which I mean let it go.

234
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:49,727
It's not in any pain.

235
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:51,629
Don't leave it in the
trap, it's cruel, honey.

236
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:57,269
Stop!

237
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:58,371
It's a rabbit, Mom.

238
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:00,016
Do you know how small
their brains are?

239
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,808
- 10 times bigger than yours?
- Well, then you let it out.

240
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,042
And I hope it bites you.

241
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,212
It's a wild animal, idiot,
it's kill or be killed.

242
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:10,515
Just let it go
and stop trapping them, okay?

243
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:12,884
You're all a bunch of women.

244
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:15,455
Kirk.

245
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:16,623
Get back here.

246
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:22,128
Tell them about the law of
the jungle, will ya, Addie?

247
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,698
Kirk, get out of the car and let it go.

248
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,874
- What's out in the hay barn?
- Dad took what we had.

249
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:37,311
That's okay, I'm on
my way to Hooks anyway.

250
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:38,512
Oh, are you?

251
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:40,748
Yes, and shut up.

252
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,684
Buddy Hooks has a huge
crush on Addie, Mom.

253
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:45,619
But neither one of
them are brave enough

254
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:47,554
to do anything about it.

255
00:23:48,357 --> 00:23:50,825
You wouldn't wanna come
with me to Hooks, would you?

256
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:52,494
And get in the way?

257
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:58,099
Do you like him or not?

258
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,804
He does have a really cute butt.

259
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:05,273
And from that springs love!

260
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,126
Idiot.

261
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,816
What the hell is that?

262
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,271
Somebody just ditched it out here?

263
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:07,673
Hell, I would.

264
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,409
What do you think's in it?

265
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:14,346
Other than cow shit,
what do you think's in it?

266
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,888
- No way.
- Oh, hell no.

267
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:25,892
- No way what?
- Look at that license plate.

268
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:28,261
Beating you?

269
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:31,164
Be eating you, and no way.

270
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:32,499
Right.

271
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,769
No way, that story's bullshit.

272
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:37,037
No, no, I
heard it really happened.

273
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,439
Yeah, I did, too.

274
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,609
- Real people disappeared.
- 20 years ago.

275
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:43,744
23 and it's just a story.

276
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:44,846
What story?

277
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:47,381
The guy who drove
around and ate people.

278
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:51,418
In a scary-ass old truck
with that license plate.

279
00:25:52,523 --> 00:25:53,989
Jeepers Creepers.

280
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,692
What?

281
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:01,930
Wasn't that the song the
guy sang or somethin'?

282
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:04,299
Look, it's homemade.

283
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:05,967
At least one idiot
every Halloween

284
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,170
makes a license
plate that says that.

285
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:10,139
You think it just drove in?

286
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,074
The tracks look fresh.

287
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:17,814
Do you think somebody
could be in there?

288
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:18,916
Man.

289
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:20,184
It's warm.

290
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:22,145
Of course it's warm, you dip-shit.

291
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:24,453
It's been sitting out in the sun.

292
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:25,955
Who'd dump it out here?

293
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:27,257
Who wouldn't?

294
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,231
Hello!

295
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:40,071
I can't see shit.

296
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,842
What say we beat it
in case they come back?

297
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:45,810
Anybody in there?

298
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:52,951
Hey, hello in there!

299
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,120
What the is wrong with you, man?

300
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,223
What?

301
00:26:57,757 --> 00:26:58,835
- I was just knockin'!
- Well, don't.

302
00:26:58,859 --> 00:26:59,859
Idiot.

303
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:08,300
Man, I say we get the hell outta here.

304
00:27:08,402 --> 00:27:09,402
Wait.

305
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,270
Break the windows first?

306
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:12,838
Hell yes, we do!

307
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,008
We gotta kill Frankenstein's truck, right?

308
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,977
Dibs on the windshield.

309
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:23,149
Kiss my ass, you ugly old bitch!

310
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:30,591
Did you see that?

311
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,327
That thing tried to kill
me, nicked my ear.

312
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:36,096
Maybe it tries to kill things

313
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,465
more stupid than it.

314
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:54,616
What the hell?

315
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,187
Those can't be real.

316
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,057
Those flies are real.

317
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,792
That smell is real.

318
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:13,532
You gonna be driving
up to see us?

319
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:15,668
Go Wheaton Valley.

320
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,004
Right?

321
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:19,705
So, 10 bales of Alfalfa?

322
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:23,778
Right.

323
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:32,486
No grandma today, huh?

324
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,955
How's she doin'?

325
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:42,164
Um...

326
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:45,566
You're not on the load list.

327
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:48,771
Oh-oh.

328
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:53,341
Do you wanna talk to my dad?

329
00:29:57,348 --> 00:29:58,680
Do you want me to?

330
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:03,952
I should put her on my load list.

331
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:08,190
You know why she lives
with her grandma, right?

332
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,958
Addie couldn't get
along with her stepdad,

333
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:12,261
so instead of kicking him
out, her mom ships her ass

334
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:13,923
out here to live with
her crazy grandma.

335
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:19,736
Can you really blame me
though, I mean, look at her.

336
00:30:19,838 --> 00:30:21,115
I'm just gonna go
to Carlan's and see if we have

337
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,139
some credit on there.

338
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:26,409
Hey, just wait a minute.

339
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:33,084
What happened?

340
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:35,631
Bernardy's, load it up
and get it out there now.

341
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:36,987
He' waiting for it.

342
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:40,191
What are you doing?

343
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:42,771
She loves that horse more
than anything in the world,

344
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:44,275
and right now it's
got nothing to eat.

345
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,896
'Cause they're broke!

346
00:30:45,998 --> 00:30:48,011
You think we're ever gonna see
the money that they owe us?

347
00:30:48,035 --> 00:30:49,779
The state's not even
sending them checks anymore.

348
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,837
And how do you know that?

349
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:54,306
Biggs down at the post
office, how do you think?

350
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:56,108
Make your point, Dad.

351
00:30:57,444 --> 00:30:59,177
You can do better.

352
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:01,379
That's my point.

353
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,860
Got some hay for you!

354
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:17,830
Turn that thing around!

355
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:21,467
Let's get your horse some breakfast!

356
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,037
What's the problem?

357
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,441
I thought you said you
had a hungry horse!

358
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:30,811
Get it out!

359
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:39,486
We gotta call someone!

360
00:31:40,423 --> 00:31:41,723
Just get it the hell out!

361
00:31:41,825 --> 00:31:42,865
What do you want us to do?

362
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,071
Alright look, it's long
enough, I can pull it out.

363
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:45,126
Do you want me to pull it out?

364
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:46,662
Just call someone!

365
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,250
There's no service out here!

366
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,032
So shut up about the
god-damn phone, alright?

367
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:53,401
- Kirk, look at me.
- Just do something!

368
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:54,503
Like what?

369
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:56,871
What the f... do you want us to do?

370
00:31:56,973 --> 00:31:59,675
You want us to try and pull it out?

371
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,345
Alright, hold him up!

372
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:08,018
Oh, shit.

373
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,759
Okay, on three, are you ready?

374
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:18,228
Hold him steady, come on!

375
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:21,198
On three I'm gonna pull
like a son of a bitch.

376
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,465
You guys ready?

377
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:25,403
One!

378
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:28,005
Two!

379
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:42,454
Oh, shit.

380
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:44,122
No!

381
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:46,357
What the f...?

382
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,292
No, help, help!

383
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:49,394
Oh, shit.

384
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:50,562
Help!

385
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:51,363
No!

386
00:32:51,465 --> 00:32:52,465
Help, help!

387
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:55,133
Red!

388
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:56,236
Red!

389
00:32:57,204 --> 00:32:58,204
Red!

390
00:32:58,672 --> 00:32:59,672
Red!

391
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:06,746
Help!

392
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:10,250
Come on, come on!

393
00:33:10,952 --> 00:33:11,718
No!

394
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,820
Help, no!

395
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:14,154
No!

396
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:16,789
No!

397
00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:17,891
Help!

398
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:21,494
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not!

399
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:22,829
I don't know what to do.

400
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,091
Maybe we could cut the cable.

401
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:24,965
With what?

402
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,834
Try the phone again!

403
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:29,271
Come on!

404
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:40,945
So this is the famous Rocket, huh?

405
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:42,814
He's a beauty.

406
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,817
You understand what
I'm saying, don't you?

407
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,418
Every word you say.

408
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Yeah?

409
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:50,555
Well in that case,

410
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,360
do you think Addie here
would ever be interested in

411
00:34:54,462 --> 00:34:55,794
say, a guy like me?

412
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,081
In the city, my mother and I had a cat.

413
00:35:16,184 --> 00:35:17,550
Addie.

414
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,486
I liked the cat.

415
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:23,857
It crapped in her boyfriend's shoes,

416
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:25,625
every chance it got.

417
00:35:26,595 --> 00:35:29,430
What happened to the boyfriend?

418
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,534
She married him.

419
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:37,338
Then got rid of the cat.

420
00:35:41,577 --> 00:35:43,944
Look, I'm not great at this.

421
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:48,717
And when I get nervous,
I start talking too much.

422
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:53,823
I, uh...

423
00:36:12,277 --> 00:36:14,377
Is that your grandmother?

424
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:28,659
Thank you for the
hay, but please just go.

425
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,396
Okay.

426
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:38,069
You wouldn't wanna come?

427
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:42,985
I mean, I gotta get the rest
of this stuff up to Bernardy's.

428
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:44,642
Have you ever been up there?

429
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,311
It's really something.

430
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,780
I mean, only if you want to.

431
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:49,948
I'd love to.

432
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:52,685
Okay.

433
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,469
What are you doing?

434
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,106
I need to know what you found.

435
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:13,840
Mom, what are you doing?

436
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,809
And why it killed you for it!

437
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:17,922
No you don't, you don't
wanna see what it'll show you.

438
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:18,946
Go!

439
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:20,014
Away!

440
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,083
Go!

441
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:31,089
Hey!

442
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:36,293
Stop!

443
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:37,561
Hey, stop!

444
00:38:43,303 --> 00:38:46,104
No!

445
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:52,711
Come on, Gaylen, are you out there?

446
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,947
I got a lot of units
headed out to station one.

447
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:58,150
What is that, a roll bar?

448
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,886
Did you reinforce this thing?

449
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:06,292
First time I met Gaylen was 23 years ago.

450
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,663
On the worst night of her life.

451
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:14,601
Her son Kenny and his
date, Darla Cleeway,

452
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,904
disappeared on their
way to the prom.

453
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:21,775
All they found was a wrecked
pickup and no bodies.

454
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:25,846
When Gaylen finally believed
what happened to Kenny,

455
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,782
she asked if she
could join the team.

456
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,387
That was the beginning for me.

457
00:39:33,356 --> 00:39:34,489
Like last night,

458
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:37,692
was the beginning for you.

459
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:58,440
Where is everybody?

460
00:42:13,392 --> 00:42:14,424
Buddy.

461
00:42:17,262 --> 00:42:18,262
Buddy.

462
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,041
Hurry.

463
00:42:32,645 --> 00:42:34,745
Go tell the sheriff to
get up here and fast,

464
00:42:34,848 --> 00:42:37,081
and bring everything he's got.

465
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:38,616
Get out of here.

466
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:41,419
And keep your eyes on the sky.

467
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:42,521
Do it.

468
00:43:02,744 --> 00:43:04,611
- Lock your door.
- What's going on?

469
00:43:04,713 --> 00:43:05,845
I don't know.

470
00:43:05,947 --> 00:43:08,548
There's men under that trailer.

471
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:13,953
- Roll your window up.
- What's happening?

472
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:19,828
Come on!

473
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:35,075
Stop making noise.

474
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,280
- Who's that with you?
- Addison Brandon.

475
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,648
What's going on?

476
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,984
- I've got guns in the barn.
- Guns?

477
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:44,086
For what?

478
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,489
Do you think you
could make a run for it?

479
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:51,493
I'd do it myself if not for
my leg and this god-damn cane.

480
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,629
What about those
guys under the truck?

481
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,931
They won't move.

482
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,401
They think they know this
thing, they got a name for it.

483
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,970
Mr. Bernardy, what,
who are you hiding from?

484
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:05,007
I don't know, I've seen
it and I still don't know.

485
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,743
Something came
down and got Apple.

486
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:08,845
Came down?

487
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,416
Spooked the horses so bad,

488
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:14,751
they jumped both the fences.

489
00:44:15,287 --> 00:44:17,220
It tried to come
down at get Matheo.

490
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:18,323
What did?

491
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:21,825
Matheo put up a fight.

492
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:23,493
What are we talking about?

493
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:24,995
It dropped him out there somewhere.

494
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:31,903
No, no, no.

495
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:19,687
Come on.

496
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:01,927
Gaylen!

497
00:47:03,397 --> 00:47:04,431
Gaylen Brandon!

498
00:47:08,337 --> 00:47:09,337
Gaylen!

499
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,746
Mrs. Brandon?

500
00:47:24,687 --> 00:47:25,687
Gaylen?

501
00:47:32,328 --> 00:47:34,295
I've been calling you.

502
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:53,081
What the hell is the matter?

503
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:56,853
It's here.

504
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,291
Is that what you came here to say?

505
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:08,064
If it's not, it will be.

506
00:48:19,278 --> 00:48:20,644
What happened?

507
00:48:22,582 --> 00:48:24,381
Just tell me one thing.

508
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:33,325
Did you bring something that can kill it?

509
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:39,164
He found it 23 years ago.

510
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:40,899
Kenny.

511
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,240
The night before he died.

512
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,480
It fell from the sky.

513
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:03,022
He didn't tell me he took it home,

514
00:49:03,124 --> 00:49:05,291
or that he hid it in the hay stool.

515
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:12,866
The horses wouldn't stay
in the barn with it.

516
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:14,601
Mom, get the horses.

517
00:49:16,905 --> 00:49:18,805
He wouldn't
say what was happening.

518
00:49:18,907 --> 00:49:19,907
Mom, just get the horses!

519
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:29,050
He must have touched that thing,

520
00:49:29,152 --> 00:49:32,920
and that was why he was
so angry and frightened.

521
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:47,336
He wanted to kill it, whatever it was.

522
00:49:51,275 --> 00:49:53,208
Maybe he thought he did.

523
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:10,293
I trapped it.

524
00:50:17,003 --> 00:50:18,235
It's under there.

525
00:50:41,462 --> 00:50:42,462
Be careful.

526
00:50:43,464 --> 00:50:47,466
If you touch that thing,
if you put your hand on it,

527
00:50:49,136 --> 00:50:50,136
you see.

528
00:50:59,614 --> 00:51:01,748
You see how it came to be.

529
00:51:08,624 --> 00:51:09,624
And,

530
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
what it is.

531
00:51:55,106 --> 00:51:56,106
Buddy.

532
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:07,718
Bud?

533
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:19,130
Seen a suspicious person.

534
00:52:38,686 --> 00:52:40,152
Stay down.

535
00:52:56,571 --> 00:52:58,671
Quick, can you see anything?

536
00:53:00,008 --> 00:53:01,541
Like what?

537
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:03,243
There's knives
and stuff on both sides.

538
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:06,513
Can you reach one that
will cut your rope?

539
00:53:07,282 --> 00:53:10,116
I tried, but it's hard for me to move.

540
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:26,578
You think her dead kid came
over the hill this morning

541
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:27,981
to tell her to vacate the premises?

542
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:29,371
What if she's right?

543
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:31,373
What if we can learn
that thing's secrets,

544
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:34,976
just by touching that
piece of its own flesh?

545
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:39,915
You're gonna go over there

546
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:41,094
and hold hands with it, aren't ya?

547
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,384
Just like she did.

548
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,888
What do you think this
is if it isn't a war?

549
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,024
War that absolutely won't stop,

550
00:53:48,126 --> 00:53:51,561
until that damn thing
doesn't exist anymore!

551
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,567
If this thing gets away again,

552
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:04,341
I'm either gonna be dead,
or too damn old next time.

553
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:15,319
What if the secret to
what this thing is,

554
00:54:17,256 --> 00:54:19,756
is the secret of how to kill it?

555
00:54:50,524 --> 00:54:51,790
Hurry.

556
00:54:55,364 --> 00:54:58,264
Sometimes he comes back fast,
it's usually with another body

557
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:01,234
and you don't wanna
be here for that.

558
00:55:07,643 --> 00:55:08,643
Kirk?

559
00:55:09,177 --> 00:55:11,811
- No way, Addie?
- Oh my god.

560
00:55:14,984 --> 00:55:17,485
My leg, I can't walk on it.

561
00:55:18,054 --> 00:55:22,089
But I could drag myself,
just get me out of this.

562
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:25,359
I checked.

563
00:55:26,195 --> 00:55:27,094
They're dead.

564
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:30,032
He thinks I'm dead,
too, and probably you.

565
00:55:30,134 --> 00:55:31,433
Why aren't we?

566
00:55:32,636 --> 00:55:34,314
I was passed out when he
wrapped me and threw me in here.

567
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:36,471
But from what I could tell,
I think he's in too big

568
00:55:36,573 --> 00:55:38,874
of a hurry to care if we are or not.

569
00:55:38,976 --> 00:55:40,286
Yeah, well let's get out of here.

570
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,310
No!

571
00:55:42,413 --> 00:55:45,213
Only he opens those, you
try, it'll split you in two.

572
00:55:45,315 --> 00:55:48,518
This whole truck's a death-trap.

573
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,554
Maybe the front.

574
00:55:52,757 --> 00:55:54,457
Try the driver's door.

575
00:55:55,593 --> 00:55:56,959
What do you see?

576
00:55:57,295 --> 00:56:00,129
It just looks like a door handle.

577
00:56:01,132 --> 00:56:03,866
There's a chain, should I try that?

578
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:04,968
Try what?

579
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,385
I don't know, maybe
it does something.

580
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,447
Like maybe the horn.

581
00:56:17,149 --> 00:56:19,016
Try that door handle.

582
00:56:24,157 --> 00:56:27,992
Say a little prayer that
one of these doors opens.

583
00:57:41,238 --> 00:57:42,504
Get behind him.

584
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:49,278
Get behind him.

585
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:04,928
Put your hands on him.

586
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:52,946
Danny.

587
00:58:57,385 --> 00:58:59,519
I know where you're going.

588
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:05,893
You will come back.

589
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:11,699
Danny!

590
00:59:13,168 --> 00:59:14,534
Danny!

591
00:59:14,937 --> 00:59:16,203
Look at me, boss!

592
00:59:18,174 --> 00:59:19,174
Sheriff!

593
00:59:20,877 --> 00:59:21,976
- Boss!
- Danny?

594
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:28,414
Danny?

595
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:32,017
Danny!

596
01:00:34,722 --> 01:00:35,754
Danny.

597
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:40,959
Look at me.

598
01:00:56,011 --> 01:00:57,011
I'm next.

599
01:01:00,015 --> 01:01:01,015
Boss?

600
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:07,321
Are you out of
your god-damn mind?

601
01:01:07,423 --> 01:01:10,024
With all due respect,
sergeant, you stand down.

602
01:01:10,126 --> 01:01:12,493
You don't tell me to stand down.

603
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:13,627
You don't know!

604
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,400
Not like us.

605
01:01:27,844 --> 01:01:29,978
You got no takeaway in this.

606
01:01:36,521 --> 01:01:37,521
Alright.

607
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:40,157
Alright.

608
01:01:44,295 --> 01:01:46,429
No!

609
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:47,863
Stop, stop, stop!

610
01:01:48,733 --> 01:01:49,733
Get him off!

611
01:01:53,972 --> 01:01:55,012
Anybody out there read me?

612
01:01:55,074 --> 01:01:56,606
Repeat, Team Deputy...

613
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:57,708
Get off me!

614
01:02:00,646 --> 01:02:02,579
Any team members
out there at all, copy me.

615
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:03,881
Repeat, Deputy Mike McGrail...

616
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:06,017
Hello!

617
01:02:06,819 --> 01:02:10,287
I got a flipped vehicle
in a field up Turvy Road.

618
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:12,123
And I mean upside-down
and still smokin'.

619
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:13,825
It's headed to the nine.

620
01:02:13,927 --> 01:02:15,204
Who is this, is that the sheriff?

621
01:02:15,228 --> 01:02:16,308
This is team leader Miller.

622
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:18,896
We copy and are putting
rubber to the road.

623
01:02:18,998 --> 01:02:20,631
Maybe 15 minutes away.

624
01:02:20,733 --> 01:02:22,467
No lights, no sirens.

625
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,909
This thing hits the nine, we're
gonna take it by surprise.

626
01:02:31,011 --> 01:02:34,079
You and Brady, you
come in from the east.

627
01:02:34,181 --> 01:02:35,981
Miller, you and Jenkins,

628
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:40,219
see if you can find a road
that gets you in front of it.

629
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,224
The point is to stay alive.

630
01:02:48,697 --> 01:02:51,831
It's what your old
man would have wanted.

631
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:03,009
You find Addie and the two of
you get the hell outta here

632
01:03:03,111 --> 01:03:06,247
and don't come back until
I tell you different.

633
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,815
So you're just okay now?

634
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,461
I just saw you rollin'
around on the ground

635
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,285
like you were having
your brain scrambled.

636
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,987
I can drive, Danny.

637
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:14,823
Danny!

638
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,326
Danny, god-damn it, move
over and let me in there!

639
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,897
I got no idea, sheriff
up in Kissle says

640
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,399
they can't even get
a man down here.

641
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:27,068
Bud is really scarin' me.

642
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:28,581
He's in some kind of
shock or something,

643
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,872
and he's not snapping out of it.

644
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,409
- I'm getting ready to run him...
- I let her go.

645
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:39,415
I let her go.

646
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,821
I couldn't hold on, Dad.

647
01:03:47,425 --> 01:03:48,702
I let her go and now she's out there

648
01:03:48,726 --> 01:03:50,393
with that thing somewhere.

649
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:51,495
Sit.

650
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:55,531
- I left her out there.
- Sit down.

651
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:58,735
- I left her, Dad!
- Sit down and stop.

652
01:03:58,837 --> 01:03:59,837
Stop talking.

653
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,820
All I know is that the truck
looks like it's been rolled.

654
01:04:09,915 --> 01:04:10,915
It's missing a god...

655
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:14,285
Jesus Christ.

656
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,355
Bud!

657
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:27,932
Holy Mary Mother of God.

658
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:29,968
You son of a bitch.

659
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:37,409
Straight with me, can we kill this thing?

660
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:41,180
Are you still a sharpshooter?

661
01:04:42,617 --> 01:04:44,483
Bet your sweet ass I am.

662
01:04:47,255 --> 01:04:50,523
Get me up closer to
that son of a bitch!

663
01:04:51,293 --> 01:04:52,826
Take his tire out.

664
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:03,436
Hit him again!

665
01:05:07,677 --> 01:05:10,411
What the hell are they made of?

666
01:05:11,848 --> 01:05:12,848
Again!

667
01:05:19,055 --> 01:05:20,187
Son of a bitch!

668
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:35,604
What the hell?

669
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,494
Mikey?

670
01:06:05,204 --> 01:06:07,705
Oh, come here, you big ugly bastard!

671
01:06:07,807 --> 01:06:09,707
- Oh, my sweet...
- Christ.

672
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:12,776
Everything ricochets off that truck.

673
01:06:12,878 --> 01:06:15,180
Mikey, come in, Mikey, listen to me.

674
01:06:15,282 --> 01:06:17,048
That truck...

675
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:19,417
Straight at it, Jenky, go!

676
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:26,791
Mikey, come in!

677
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:28,561
Michael!

678
01:06:29,129 --> 01:06:31,162
Don't shoot at the god-damn truck!

679
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:33,265
Mikey!

680
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:34,533
Do you read me?

681
01:06:41,275 --> 01:06:42,308
Mikey, come in.

682
01:06:46,347 --> 01:06:47,813
Michael, pick up!

683
01:06:47,915 --> 01:06:49,882
Mikey, do you read me?

684
01:06:49,985 --> 01:06:52,319
Don't shoot at that god-damn truck!

685
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:55,956
For my old man and 1,000 others, you ugly.

686
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:22,084
Hold on!

687
01:07:59,124 --> 01:08:00,124
Danny?

688
01:08:23,484 --> 01:08:24,516
Danny!

689
01:08:28,255 --> 01:08:29,255
Danny!

690
01:08:44,506 --> 01:08:45,506
Take this!

691
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:48,609
Son of a...

692
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:57,819
Cover me.

693
01:09:01,023 --> 01:09:02,023
Davis!

694
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:05,927
Get down!

695
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,268
Don't give him what he wants.

696
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:16,871
Swallow your fear.

697
01:09:19,142 --> 01:09:20,775
Don't give it to him.

698
01:09:22,112 --> 01:09:24,145
You cover me as best you can.

699
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:27,049
Then you haul your ass outta here.

700
01:09:27,151 --> 01:09:29,752
It can't get both of us if we split up.

701
01:09:29,854 --> 01:09:30,854
Split up?

702
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:34,123
We both gotta take him, Danny.

703
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,358
We need the firepower!

704
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:40,694
Hey!

705
01:10:41,329 --> 01:10:42,362
Hey, you!

706
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:08,489
Davis, get the hell
out of here, move!

707
01:14:08,014 --> 01:14:11,349
Whatever you think
you can do, you can't.

708
01:14:13,353 --> 01:14:15,653
You're not gonna stop me.

709
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,390
So go away.

710
01:14:19,259 --> 01:14:22,560
It took her, Mom, it's got Addison now.

711
01:14:26,834 --> 01:14:27,834
What?

712
01:15:01,437 --> 01:15:02,770
Where's Addie?

713
01:18:50,513 --> 01:18:52,113
You have reached
the tri-county Sheriff's

714
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:56,049
department, servicing Baniff,
Trotula and Poho Counties.

715
01:18:56,152 --> 01:18:58,352
This line is for emergency calls only.

716
01:18:58,454 --> 01:19:01,021
If this is an emergency,
please hold the line.

717
01:21:04,086 --> 01:21:05,453
Addie?

718
01:21:35,019 --> 01:21:39,088
Every 23rd spring
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

719
01:21:41,827 --> 01:21:43,360
That's what we know.

720
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:49,166
And the terrible things
it leaves in its wake,

721
01:21:50,803 --> 01:21:52,869
missing fathers and mothers,

722
01:21:54,707 --> 01:21:56,273
brothers, sisters,

723
01:21:59,045 --> 01:22:00,511
daughters and sons.

724
01:22:03,183 --> 01:22:04,482
We know that, too.

725
01:22:09,656 --> 01:22:12,156
The creature reshapes our minds,

726
01:22:13,493 --> 01:22:16,395
and changes the course of our lives.

727
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:53,467
What are you doing here?

728
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:57,505
They're picking me up here,
I didn't miss 'em, did I?

729
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:01,542
- They're picking you up here?
- So I could say goodbye.

730
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:04,178
They don't care,
it's on the way.

731
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:07,616
Really, are you doing okay?

732
01:23:08,852 --> 01:23:12,154
I'm out of the house, out in the sunshine.

733
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,423
And back with your
old boyfriend, huh?

734
01:23:19,096 --> 01:23:21,163
They say it's gone, you know.

735
01:23:21,265 --> 01:23:23,098
You really believe it?

736
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,034
Gone for another 23 years?

737
01:23:25,136 --> 01:23:29,071
You think we'll still be
around here to find out?

738
01:23:39,684 --> 01:23:41,785
I'm gonna worry about you.

739
01:23:41,887 --> 01:23:43,432
I can't believe they're letting you go.

740
01:23:43,456 --> 01:23:44,466
The last time we made it to state.

741
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:46,523
I don't think Armageddon
will keep us from goin'.

742
01:23:46,559 --> 01:23:47,559
Is that your dad talking?

743
01:23:48,093 --> 01:23:50,327
I got a family who live in Bolander.

744
01:23:50,429 --> 01:23:52,162
I might stay an extra day.

745
01:23:52,264 --> 01:23:53,096
I'm gonna miss you.

746
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:56,066
Well, I'll miss you more, I'll bet.

747
01:23:57,169 --> 01:23:59,337
Keep an eye on my truck for me.

748
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,308
At the end of those 23 days,

749
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:38,879
in an open field by a
broken down school bus,

750
01:24:39,214 --> 01:24:41,314
it once again ran out of time,

751
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:44,284
at the rusty tip of a homemade harpoon.

752
01:24:44,386 --> 01:24:47,220
But most of you know this already.

753
01:24:47,322 --> 01:24:50,123
I record these words as a testament.

754
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:54,629
This 23rd spring is a call to arms.

755
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:58,332
We will not fail and we will not fear.

756
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,170
My name is Trisha Jenner,

757
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:07,174
and this time when it comes,

758
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:11,313
I will destroy the thing
that killed by brother.

759
01:25:14,718 --> 01:25:15,718
So...

760
01:25:17,087 --> 01:25:19,988
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch.
