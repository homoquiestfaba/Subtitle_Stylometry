1
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:36,342
Mel, can I get you to approve this?

2
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:38,075
Mel, which one?

3
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,487
This one.

4
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:48,428
Come on, people.
What have you done for me lately, huh?

5
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:50,690
Overnights, Mel. Read them and weep.

6
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:53,533
Where's Boise?

7
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:56,467
I don't see Boise. Where's Pakistan?

8
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,594
Come on.

9
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:01,163
-Mel, baby, you're gonna just love today.
-I'd better, Alan.

10
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:03,906
I don't see much teamwork.

11
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:05,501
Caroline, my coffee is cold!

12
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:08,411
<i>We tell ourselves we are after the truth...</i>

13
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:10,882
<i>we tell ourselves we deal in facts...</i>

14
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:14,079
<i>and yet for those of us who've been</i>
<i>in my business long enough...</i>

15
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,019
<i>we are haunted by the realization...</i>

16
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:18,591
<i>that the facts alone</i>
<i>don't always lead to the truth.</i>

17
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,627
...from the White House after the speech.

18
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:23,993
No spin. Do not tolerate
any spin whatsoever.

19
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:26,098
Where's Boise?

20
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:29,730
<i>Like most of the really important stories</i>
<i>we've covered...</i>

21
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:34,602
<i>this one, the biggest armed confrontation</i>
<i>in America since the Civil War...</i>

22
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,646
<i>started with seemingly unrelated incidents</i>
<i>that had first been almost unnoticed...</i>

23
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:41,612
<i>and then spun out of control.</i>

24
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,913
As most of you know, Gov. Farley is
on his way back from Washington.

25
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,581
He'll be addressing you at some point
later today or tomorrow.

26
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,320
However, he has authorized me
to make this statement on his behalf.

27
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:59,497
Effective immediately,
the state of Idaho is closing its borders.

28
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,099
If necessary, by the use of force.

29
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:06,995
<i>I have ordered our State Troopers to set up</i>
<i>checkpoints on the borders...</i>

30
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:10,745
<i>and no one will be allowed in without</i>
<i>authorization from the Idaho authorities.</i>

31
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:10,972
<i>and no one will be allowed in without</i>
<i>authorization from the Idaho authorities.</i>

32
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:13,342
<i>There'll be no questions at this time.</i>

33
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:15,505
He's closing the borders, people.

34
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:19,143
Thank God for arrogance, lust and greed,
or we'd all be doing infomercials.

35
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,619
Let's go, people. I smell a 20 share.

36
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:23,952
Where the hell is Pakistan?
Where's the White House?

37
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:26,822
Do we still have a White House
or has Tokyo foreclosed on it?

38
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:27,916
Coming up.

39
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:29,757
<i>We'll return to Boise momentarily.</i>

40
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:34,594
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>developments in Pakistan are continuing...</i>

41
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:37,694
<i>as more orphans are being assembled</i>
<i>for the flight to America.</i>

42
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:42,331
<i>It is now 38 days</i>
<i>since the event that started it all:</i>

43
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:45,941
<i>The nuclear explosion</i>
<i>from the Indian missiles...</i>

44
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:48,640
<i>that devastated over 10,000 square miles...</i>

45
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:52,515
<i>of the area around the Pakistani capital</i>
<i>of Islamabad.</i>

46
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:56,756
<i>At the Peshawar Airport</i>
<i>in Northern Pakistan...</i>

47
00:03:56,857 --> 00:04:00,588
<i>the first of several planeloads of children</i>
<i>orphaned by the atomic blast...</i>

48
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,321
<i>is preparing to leave.</i>

49
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:04,522
<i>Destination: Twin Falls, Idaho.</i>

50
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:07,992
<i>The rescue mission is under the supervision</i>
<i>of Amelia Sims...</i>

51
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,367
<i>head of the controversial</i>
<i>Give to the Children Corporation.</i>

52
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,998
<i>However, as we've just reported...</i>

53
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,975
<i>Gov. Farley has closed the border</i>
<i>of that state.</i>

54
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:21,169
<i>Its politicians maneuver behind the scenes</i>
<i>to avoid a crisis...</i>

55
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:23,944
<i>but confrontation seems</i>
<i>increasingly inevitable.</i>

56
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,109
What's the matter?

57
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,154
<i>The Governor's press secretary says</i>
<i>no one will be allowed in...</i>

58
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:30,416
<i>without permission</i>
<i>from the Idaho authorities....</i>

59
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:31,752
Jesus Christ!

60
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:34,794
A country's becoming unglued
and the bird goes down.

61
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:38,092
-How about the satellite? We got Bombay--
-I don't care what it is.

62
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,032
I want the orphans.

63
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:44,764
-Can't do it, we're losing them!
-Don't tell me this, people. Not today.

64
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:47,102
<i>We seem to be having problems</i>
<i>with our picture.</i>

65
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,642
Go to the White House. Go!

66
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:52,910
<i>We apologize for the technical difficulties.</i>

67
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:58,417
<i>Steven Kingsley is standing by</i>
<i>at the White House with a live report.</i>

68
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,454
<i>Helena, Matthew,</i>
<i>we've just seen an indication...</i>

69
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:04,183
<i>of the way the White House</i>
<i>is handling these events...</i>

70
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,782
<i>when Jack Buchan,</i>
<i>high-powered lobbyist...</i>

71
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:10,057
<i>and unofficial public relations advisor</i>
<i>to the President...</i>

72
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,392
<i>arrived here.</i>

73
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:16,265
<i>As president of Cathers and Hilton,</i>
<i>the huge Washington PR firm...</i>

74
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,895
<i>Buchan is not a member of the Cabinet...</i>

75
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:21,304
<i>but in times of extreme crisis...</i>

76
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:24,036
<i>he is often seen around the White House.</i>

77
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:26,640
So what do the polls say?

78
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:29,477
52% are in favor of strong action.

79
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,643
There is no other kind.
Idaho will be stopped.

80
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:35,187
-I want those orphans in there.
-Yes, sir.

81
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,654
What do the Florida polls show?

82
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,918
Florida was the swing vote
in the last election.

83
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:42,325
In Florida,
only 38% are in favor of strong action...

84
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,989
and most of them are over the age of 75.

85
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,933
Statistically, most of them will be dead
before the next election.

86
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,965
Dead supporters are the worst.
They take up a ton of your time, and then...

87
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:55,541
where the hell are they
when you need them?

88
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,638
Shit. So, what do we do?

89
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:02,709
Sometimes, the best action is no action.

90
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:05,341
Well, nobody believes in action
more than I do, Mike.

91
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,044
Mr. President...

92
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:12,356
I think the answer is to move
the whole thing up to a new paradigm like....

93
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:16,088
I'm talking about moving it on
to the image level.

94
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:18,761
Now, that's my business. I know image.

95
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:23,829
And the great thing about image is that you
look like you're doing something strong...

96
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:26,205
but you don't necessarily do it.

97
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:29,504
That way, they nail you, and poof!
There's nothing to hit.

98
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:31,633
And?

99
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,279
I got them. Mel, I got them back.

100
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:38,181
The first load of orphans is in the air.
It's the one we put Tony Phillips on.

101
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:40,185
They may have
to make an emergency landing.

102
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:42,653
What do you mean....
Get Phillips on the horn.

103
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,451
What is our 20 at JFK, please?

104
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,055
-You cannot have--
<i>-Tony, what the hell's going on up there?</i>

105
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,033
Mel, for Christ's sake,
I got no control over it.

106
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:59,834
We got a plane full of orphans,
and the toilets have stopped working, okay?

107
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,964
<i>So what?</i>

108
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:04,044
We just have to land in Newfoundland
for a few hours to fix it.

109
00:07:04,144 --> 00:07:06,544
Tony, let me ask you something.

110
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:10,344
You wanna land at JFK in the middle of
the afternoon when nobody's watching...

111
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:12,646
and maybe get a 1.2 share...

112
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:16,018
or do you wanna land at JFK, prime time,
in the morning...

113
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:18,523
and perhaps garner a 28 share?

114
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,853
<i>Which one, Tony?</i>

115
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,793
Mel, I'm telling you,
this is a flying planeload of shit.

116
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:25,831
<i>Tony, this is the biggest story...</i>

117
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:30,094
<i>in the last half century.</i>
<i>And you are the human side of it, okay?</i>

118
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,830
So whatever you have to do
to keep those kids up there...

119
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,909
stick a cork up their asses,
you do it, you understand?

120
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,204
-Hey, Mel!
-What?

121
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,539
Idaho's coming in.

122
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,846
We apologize again
for the technical difficulties.

123
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:44,941
We'll return to the orphans remaining
at the Pakistani airport...

124
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:46,610
for their flight to America.

125
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,746
Excuse me, Helena,
we have just received word...

126
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:53,520
that Gov. Farley will be returning
to the State House momentarily.

127
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:57,188
As you know, the Governor's expected
to make some sort of statement...

128
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:58,787
within the next 24 hours...

129
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:03,060
<i>and he is certainly one of the more</i>
<i>controversial governors in this country.</i>

130
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,933
<i>Once known for his liberal views...</i>

131
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,339
<i>Jim Farley has been criticized for playing</i>
<i>to his state's conservative majority.</i>

132
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,810
<i>And indeed, Gov. Farley's approval</i>
<i>ratings have jumped 12 percentage points...</i>

133
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:17,281
<i>since he adopted his bold</i>
<i>anti-immigration stance...</i>

134
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,909
<i>an outgrowth of his successful</i>
<i>reelection campaign...</i>

135
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,955
<i>which played to a theme</i>
<i>that still resonates today.</i>

136
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,389
<i>America. As it should be.</i>

137
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,492
<i>Gov. Farley has just arrived</i>
<i>on the steps of the Capitol.</i>

138
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,895
<i>Let's switch there now, live.</i>

139
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:37,160
<i>When are you going to</i>
<i>make the announcement, Governor?</i>

140
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:39,171
<i>Who's advising you on this conflict?</i>

141
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:40,831
<i>I can't tell....</i>

142
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:44,333
Okay, line up the reacts
from the White House.

143
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:47,107
Tell Kingsley to get the President.

144
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,739
Get the President,
like in send out a search party?

145
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,444
-Correct.
-All right, who's got Christina Fernandez?

146
00:08:55,856 --> 00:08:57,153
Yes, yes.

147
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:02,218
The universe shall unfold as it does,
ladies and gentlemen.

148
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:04,155
-Governor.
-Who is there?

149
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:06,232
-Alan?
-Governor, answer the question.

150
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,858
Alan, I can hardly hear you.

151
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:10,561
The balloon's going up.

152
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:14,103
<i>You'll be hearing from me soon</i>
<i>on the matter. Yes, you will.</i>

153
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:15,872
This is what it comes down to:

154
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:18,843
One guy controls
the fate of the whole damn country.

155
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:20,971
You've all been very understanding.

156
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,948
Yes. Tomorrow. Guaranteed.

157
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,917
My life is out of control. Christ.

158
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:36,491
She hardly acknowledges I'm alive.
You saw her.

159
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:39,327
It's like I'm a goddamn window.
She looked right through me.

160
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:43,267
Governor, I don't know if this is the time
to let her get to you like this.

161
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,338
What the hell is it with women? Christ.

162
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:48,806
Doesn't going to bed and fucking
your brains out mean anything anymore?

163
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:52,504
Governor, I can get the State Troopers
to cut you another one out the herd.

164
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:56,413
There's plenty of cocktail waitresses
you ain't been through on that frontier.

165
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:57,745
I want Christina.

166
00:09:57,851 --> 00:10:00,649
What is it with her?
She knows I can't leave my wife.

167
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:04,520
Governor, you got a crisis to handle,
and she knows damn well you do.

168
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,993
That's the problem with women.
They never listen to reason.

169
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:07,858
That's the problem with women.
They never listen to reason.

170
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,359
Governor, the White House just called.

171
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:15,993
God damn it, get the hell out of here.
This is important.

172
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:18,704
Close the damn door.

173
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,235
White House.

174
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:24,935
Look, Governor, I'll see what I can do
to get her thinking straight again.

175
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:26,842
But right now, you gotta get ready...

176
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:28,881
to go in front of the whole
country tomorrow.

177
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:31,780
Yeah. Politics is just another form of sex.

178
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:34,153
You know that, don't you?

179
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,248
Jim, I need you to--

180
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:38,881
I just got through to Tony Phillips.

181
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:41,426
I'm going to JFK
to meet the plane in the morning.

182
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:44,224
-I need you here.
-Yeah, but I do better work out there.

183
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:48,700
Jim, I don't want better work, okay?
I need grab-them-by-the-throat news.

184
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:53,071
Haven't you noticed ethics and taste
are passé, history?

185
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:55,903
-It's not the '90s anymore.
-No, you're living proof of it.

186
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,636
Tony Phillips is holding on line five.

187
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:01,339
You know something? I hold you
responsible for my predicament.

188
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:02,779
Let me explain.

189
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:05,875
When I was in "J" school, I used to watch
you on <i>ABC</i> and I'd say:

190
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:08,420
"Look at that dignity and class.

191
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,351
"Maybe you could be in news
without being a cynical cog...

192
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,790
"in some son of a bitch
corporate structure."

193
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:16,727
Boy, was I conned. You suckered me in.

194
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,594
-I'm gonna get you for that.
-Mel, you have, many times.

195
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,724
Tony, it's Jim again.

196
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,667
<i>-He wants to do what?</i>
<i>-Just a minute. Jim, hold on.</i>

197
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:29,037
<i>We will not be silenced</i>
<i>by some ridiculous need for prime time.</i>

198
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:33,640
Tony, grab yourself a barf bag
and put Miss First Amendment on the line.

199
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:37,542
<i>It's Mel Burgess, our executive producer.</i>
<i>He wants to talk to you.</i>

200
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,441
<i>It's hardwired to the--</i>

201
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:42,420
Having quite a ride up there,
aren't you, Miss Sims?

202
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:46,452
<i>Mr. Burgess, what is it that you want?</i>

203
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,018
I just wanted you to know,
if you didn't land in Newfoundland...

204
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,361
and arrived at JFK in the middle
of morning prime time--

205
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:56,129
<i>Yeah, well, what the hell do I care</i>
<i>about prime time?</i>

206
00:11:56,236 --> 00:12:00,195
Miss Sims, let's face it.
Right now, you are a two-bit charity, okay?

207
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:05,244
But if you land at JFK, smack in the middle
of morning prime time...

208
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:09,107
and America sees these kids getting off
the plane in their wretched state...

209
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,650
you will be inundated with money,
Miss Sims.

210
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,686
You'll be bigger than Save the Children.

211
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:16,085
<i>That is the most ridiculous thing that I....</i>

212
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:18,657
<i>Did he say "bigger than Save the Children"?</i>

213
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:24,288
Everybody's got a magic button.
Our job: Find it and push it.

214
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:27,697
Okay, Jim, you're it. Orphan patrol.
Get to JFK.

215
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:30,326
Keep them up there for a couple of hours
till prime time.

216
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:32,769
<i>...still no word from the White House...</i>

217
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:36,206
<i>but unofficially, one aide has said that,</i>
<i>and I quote:</i>

218
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:38,707
<i>"Strong action will be taken. "

219
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:42,573
Gov. Farley won't come to the telephone.

220
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,216
So, what now?

221
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:51,721
If that son of a bitch is going to make
the speech I think he's going to make...

222
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,217
he could wipe us out.

223
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:57,796
I smell an image-deficiency syndrome
on our hands.

224
00:12:57,898 --> 00:13:01,390
What the hell are we talking about?
"lmage-deficiency syndrome."

225
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:04,129
If I may, sir....

226
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,439
When I set up your election campaign...

227
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,031
I knew you'd be elected,
like all other Presidents...

228
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:10,632
because of image.

229
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:12,541
Now, no disrespect, sir...

230
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:15,679
but the American people vote
for the sizzle, not the steak.

231
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:19,445
It's only afterwards the poor bastards
have to bite into the fat and gristle.

232
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:22,488
-This is not about image.
-I beg your pardon, Warren.

233
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:24,720
Mr. President...

234
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:29,424
we're dealing with something a hell of a lot
more than just messy reality here.

235
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:32,431
See, at my shop, we represent everyone...

236
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,300
from the Apple Growers Association
to the government of Zimbabwe.

237
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:39,895
And I've got a dozen clients who are gonna
load their collective pants...

238
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:43,669
if that son of a bitch even looks like
he's gonna run circles around us.

239
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:46,871
-No one's gonna run circles around us.
-Exactly.

240
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:50,874
Now, we have an election next year.
And unless you keep that in mind...

241
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:54,511
when it's over, this President could be out
building houses for the poor...

242
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,111
like Jimmy Carter.

243
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:58,191
I've never even fixed a faucet.

244
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,491
-Jim's at JFK.
-Hang in there, Jim.

245
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:08,932
Idaho's coming up.
Farley's about to make his speech.

246
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:12,238
Christina, stay with him all the way
up to the podium, okay?

247
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,567
Stay with him.

248
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:18,508
Mel, he's not even here. He's still upstairs.
It's gonna be a feeding frenzy down here.

249
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:23,078
You see, Governor, you gotta look at this
as an opportunity and not a problem.

250
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:25,674
I don't see this as much of an opportunity.

251
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:29,384
She's talking about wanting
to get transferred out of state.

252
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:31,213
So there you go now.

253
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,652
You stand up there, you make that speech.

254
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,594
In a few minutes, she's gonna be
watching you like a hound in heat.

255
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:40,191
-You really think so?
-You're goddamn right.

256
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,566
I mean, women love power.
They swarm around it like flies around shit.

257
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:46,263
How could she do this to me?

258
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:49,536
We made love just last Friday.
Right here in this office.

259
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,172
On that damn couch you're sitting on
right now.

260
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:58,183
No accounting for loyalty these days, huh?

261
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:02,722
-By the way, your wife called.
-Cover for me.

262
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:07,082
Plane full of orphans. One hour out of JFK.

263
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:09,321
So, Caroline, you wanna be
in the news business?

264
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:12,830
Start thinking train wrecks.
Electronic train wrecks.

265
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:16,198
Only, the trains are people,
like Farley and the White House.

266
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:20,501
All we do is put them on the same track
and let them head towards each other.

267
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:30,877
You told me she was staying here,
and I'm telling you she's gone.

268
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:33,043
She's here. Let's just....

269
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:40,455
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

270
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:44,629
You all know that I've just ordered
the borders of Idaho to be closed...

271
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:49,561
and this action is being implemented
to preserve our way of life.

272
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:51,593
The American dream...

273
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:55,972
that has been falsely and cynically held out
to the entire rest of the world...

274
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:59,136
which has grown by a billion people
in merely the last 10 years.

275
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:01,976
Count them, folks. One billion.

276
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:05,284
Standing room only,
from Maine to California.

277
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:08,320
And by allowing the stampede of...

278
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:12,650
whatever you wanna call them,
immigrants, refugees, illegals...

279
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,159
legals, migrants, aliens, you name it...

280
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:17,093
we are being swamped.

281
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:20,394
<i>And we are destroying our own way of life...</i>

282
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:25,770
<i>at a time when the business community has</i>
<i>presided over the wholesale destruction...</i>

283
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,807
<i>of our manufacturing capability.</i>
<i>Shipped it overseas.</i>

284
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,203
I don't know. I liked him better
when he was a blond.

285
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:36,047
<i>We are told that we have to stand by...</i>

286
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,084
<i>and let the rest of the world</i>
<i>flood into America.</i>

287
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:41,881
Stay with these kids. Hello?

288
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:44,713
Come on. Where's the news crew?

289
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:48,260
Excuse me, I don't see.... Oh, is that....
Hi, are you with News Net?

290
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:49,453
-Yes.
-Amelia Sims.

291
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:52,760
News Net control room,
Tony's in pretty bad shape.

292
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:54,766
<i>That's why you're there, Jim.</i>

293
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:57,660
Okay, this one, too.
All of these are orphans.

294
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:59,238
<i>Folks, America....</i>

295
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,569
The global village on prime time.

296
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:01,875
Boys, if it ain't on the screen,
it ain't happening.

297
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,036
Boys, if it ain't on the screen,
it ain't happening.

298
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:07,238
-Let's go, bring it in. Come on.
-Stand by in effects....

299
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:10,607
<i>And now, this group of activists...</i>

300
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:13,752
<i>who have decided, on their own,</i>
<i>to bring into Idaho...</i>

301
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,152
<i>thousands and thousands of these</i>
<i>unfortunate Pakistani children...</i>

302
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:19,885
<i>who have been orphaned</i>
<i>by that terrible war...</i>

303
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:22,359
-Beautiful.
<i>-...have told the government...</i>

304
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:25,454
<i>and the people of this state</i>
<i>to mind our own business.</i>

305
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,894
Well, as it turns out...

306
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:31,660
that is exactly what I intend to do.

307
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,805
I was not elected by the people...

308
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:41,744
of Idaho...

309
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:45,351
to...

310
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:49,221
<i>to...</i>

311
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,281
<i>preside...</i>

312
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:55,520
-What's the matter?
<i>-...over the dissolution...</i>

313
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:57,392
of our way of life.

314
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:02,966
Therefore, I am taking control
of all matters related to our own borders...

315
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:07,601
and to immigration and citizenship.

316
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:10,972
This is unconstitutional. You can't do this!

317
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:13,940
I just have. Thank you.

318
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:19,284
Come on, Christina, stay with the Governor.

319
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:24,613
God damn it, the Governor's the center
of the whole thing. Go in closer.

320
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,258
Closer.

321
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:29,157
Any closer and I'd be going down on him.

322
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,827
What was the question, Miss Fernandez?

323
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,700
Christina, stay with the Governor.

324
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:43,074
What the hell's going on?
She's always right on top of him.

325
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:45,402
Trying to tell you.... Hey, Trey.

326
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,944
Come on, sugar, I don't mean any harm.

327
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:50,346
I thought you might want
a little quality time...

328
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,283
to patch up this little lover's tiff
that you and him had.

329
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:57,379
Mr. Cannon,
I don't need you to sort out my personal life.

330
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,957
Come on, darling.

331
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,688
I'm just trying to be a friend here, okay?

332
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,125
-He is crazy about you, you know that.
-Oh, please.

333
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:10,765
It was an affair, okay?
Let's just keep it at that.

334
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:14,297
Right now, I just need to remember
that I'm a reporter...

335
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:16,102
and get on with my life.

336
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:19,269
You know, I'm always amazed
at how wrong I can be.

337
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:22,075
Hell, I figured you really had a thing for him.

338
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:28,076
Are you aware that I was born in Mexico?

339
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:31,581
See, I came here when I was 3 years old.

340
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,282
That makes me an immigrant.

341
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:38,660
He wants to keep people like me out,
so I'm out.

342
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,990
Aren't you taking this a little personally?

343
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,100
I hope so.

344
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,264
He wants to marry you.

345
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:53,874
He what?

346
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:57,210
Look, the budget is all blown to hell.

347
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:58,477
Why can't we take at least--

348
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:02,180
Sorry I'm late, but those darned orphans
didn't read the interoffice memo.

349
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:06,281
<i>When I started out as a reporter,</i>
<i>the world seemed more remote.</i>

350
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:09,520
<i>News came at us slower,</i>
<i>in ways we could absorb.</i>

351
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:14,189
<i>We never dreamed of satellite feeds</i>
<i>or live reports from distant lands.</i>

352
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:18,602
<i>But now, Idaho and Pakistan</i>
<i>might as well be right next door.</i>

353
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:22,273
<i>The entire world is swarming</i>
<i>into our video monitors...</i>

354
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,037
<i>as well as into the towns</i>
<i>and cities of America.</i>

355
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:26,941
<i>And it's changing us all.</i>

356
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:29,037
<i>And you tell yourself you're a pro...</i>

357
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:31,481
<i>that you can handle</i>
<i>the passions and tensions...</i>

358
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:33,916
<i>without letting your own feelings</i>
<i>get in the way.</i>

359
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,851
<i>At least that's what you tell yourself.</i>

360
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:37,980
This network, isn't it worth some money?

361
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,786
What have we got on the White House?

362
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:40,882
Hi, Sandy.

363
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:43,053
-Still nothing, the scum.
-They're your people.

364
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:44,357
Bullshit, Alan!

365
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:46,022
Stop! What about the backgrounders?

366
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:47,531
We got one running right now.

367
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:49,727
Okay, I want backgrounders on everything...

368
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:53,704
environment, immigration, refugees,
the whole nine yards, okay? Blitz it.

369
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,740
<i>The three freighters filled with Albanians</i>
<i>fleeing the Russian conflict...</i>

370
00:20:57,844 --> 00:21:01,644
<i>have been refused entry at the already</i>
<i>crowded Port of Charleston--</i>

371
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:04,216
We ignore the fact
that the economic infrastructure...

372
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,944
of every American city is crumbling.

373
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:08,714
It's not the fault of the refugees
and the immigrants--

374
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:11,017
Alan, it's not even
the goddamn issue right now!

375
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:13,115
-It's right in the middle of--
-You can--

376
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:15,888
<i>The crisis began</i>
<i>when three million starving refugees...</i>

377
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:17,155
<i>fled Fujian province.</i>

378
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:19,663
<i>The pesticides that seeped</i>
<i>through the water table--</i>

379
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:22,792
Human beings let it get out of control,
it's not some act of God.

380
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:26,429
They had their worst famine
in the last 150 years, for Christ's sake.

381
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,632
Can I have a glass of milk with this, please?

382
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:32,336
<i>There's no way I'm gonna let Idaho go</i>
<i>like other small-population states...</i>

383
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:36,176
<i>like Rhode Island, which became</i>
<i>almost totally Chinese in six years...</i>

384
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:37,977
<i>when it was swamped by refugees.</i>

385
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:40,314
<i>Millions of Chinese</i>
<i>settled in Rhode Island...</i>

386
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,479
<i>in the same presidential election year...</i>

387
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:45,990
<i>when the controversial</i>
<i>Department of Ethnic Affairs was created.</i>

388
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:49,357
So it's our fault they cut down their forests
or breed like rabbits...

389
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:53,023
-and then want to come to America?
-Don't talk about breeding, I'm eating.

390
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:56,932
I'm not talking about breeding,
but about the social situation on the planet.

391
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:59,698
<i>Agents of the US Border Patrol</i>
<i>have been unable to stem...</i>

392
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:03,537
<i>the unprecedented numbers of Salvadorians</i>
<i>flooding into the USA.</i>

393
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:07,044
The Chinese item we'll let on,
but drop any Latin stuff.

394
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:09,546
We've got too many Hispanic advertisers.

395
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:13,176
Are we still a news organization
or are we the Home Shopping Network now?

396
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:15,777
Chris, don't bite the hand that feeds you...

397
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:18,619
which happens to include
Hispanic advertisers.

398
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:20,124
The country is....

399
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:23,320
El countrio is muy fucked-upio!

400
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:25,420
Can you network guys understand that?

401
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:27,465
You've got an attitude problem.

402
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:31,799
I find this impassioned tone
of yours very offensive.

403
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:34,039
I'm offensive? Jesus!

404
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,573
Africa is a mess.

405
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:39,008
Use the last Rwandan massacre,
there are no Rwandan advertisers.

406
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:41,740
<i>For the third time in recent years</i>
<i>the people of Rwanda...</i>

407
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:43,645
<i>are being massacred at an alarming rate.</i>

408
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,377
<i>Entire villages have been wiped out.</i>

409
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:48,679
Heads up, everyone! Orphan alert!

410
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:52,554
JFK's coming in. Second batch
of Pakistani orphans, runway 23.

411
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:55,292
And what have you done for Mel lately?

412
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:58,790
<i>Runway 23 at JFK International Airport.</i>

413
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:01,199
<i>News Net's Jim Kalla is there.</i>

414
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:05,166
<i>This is Jim Kalla for News Net,</i>
<i>I'm here with Amelia Sims.</i>

415
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:06,431
<i>-Give to the--</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

416
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:11,272

<i>these children to our shelters in Idaho...</i>

417
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:12,844
<i>come hell or high water.</i>

418
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:14,379
<i>And it's our right.</i>

419
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,540
<i>And no governor is going to stop us.</i>
<i>Let me just also say that--</i>

420
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:21,578
Stand by, Boise. As soon as we dump JFK,
we will be coming to you.

421
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:23,952
I love the smell of burning ambition.

422
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:29,885
<i>And we are going to deal with that.</i>
<i>And let me just say that the organization....</i>

423
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:32,794
<i>Of course I care</i>
<i>about those poor Pakistani orphans.</i>

424
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:35,527
<i>But I don't live in Pakistan. I live here!</i>

425
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:41,529
<i>This is what I'm all about,</i>
<i>the American dream!</i>

426
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:44,442
How come every time I see him,
I think I'm gonna barf?

427
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:46,535
Anything American makes you want to barf.

428
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:50,013
Stop the college debate.
We're news, emotions happen outside.

429
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:58,990
Folks, the Governor.

430
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:02,194
-Good morning.
-Bang!

431
00:24:04,998 --> 00:24:06,090
That's cute.

432
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,106
Folks...

433
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:22,842
I know y'all wanna let the Governor know
how much you're supporting him, but...

434
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:26,385
if you could give us a few minutes
to discuss some important matters...

435
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:29,319
I'd really appreciate it.
Is there a room that we could use?

436
00:24:29,422 --> 00:24:31,913
Sure. You can use our bedroom,
right down the hall.

437
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:34,084
Turn left at the rocket launcher.

438
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:37,919
Excuse us. Thank you.

439
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:39,657
Bang!

440
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,098
-Hey, big fella.
-You got to talk to these people.

441
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:46,962
Jesus!

442
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:49,871
-This is getting to be too much.
-What is?

443
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:52,206
Christina! She's not out there.

444
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:55,346
Governor, look, I got it wired--

445
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:56,938
Jesus Christ!

446
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:59,107
Who keeps a bowl of grenades
in their bedroom?

447
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:00,981
Jesus, get away from there.

448
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,153
Look, I got it wired.
I've talked to the News Net people...

449
00:25:04,257 --> 00:25:07,954
and told them we'll give her an exclusive,
so they're on her to stay close.

450
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:10,723
Now let's just think
of all those people in the next room.

451
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,321
These militia folks can come in real handy.

452
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,758
What the hell is this?

453
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:18,900
Bazooms and bazookas?

454
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:22,473
Maybe Ladies Auxiliary, I don't know.

455
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:25,009
Jesus Christ!

456
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:30,178
I don't know about all this.

457
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:33,309
Governor, let's just not forget
who voted for you.

458
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:36,315
The whole goddamn state
is one big militia now.

459
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:46,821
<i>As Gov. Farley avoided reporters' questions</i>
<i>on his links with militia groups....</i>

460
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,994
Don't make any sense.

461
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:53,198
Just because we got a President whose face
belongs on the back of milk cartons...

462
00:25:53,306 --> 00:25:56,503
doesn't mean that the whole White House
has got to be quiet.

463
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:57,837
It's fishy.

464
00:25:59,612 --> 00:26:01,603
Steve, smoke him out.

465
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:05,111
What amazes most observers here:

466
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:07,948
There has still been no response
from the President.

467
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:10,921
We've got the Chief of Staff,
what more do you want?

468
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:12,386
Same to you.

469
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,922
President's on his way,
but before he arrives...

470
00:26:15,027 --> 00:26:16,790
there's a few things I want to go over.

471
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:20,354
Buchan, since when does a lobbyist set
the agenda for the White House?

472
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:21,831
Mr. Secretary...

473
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:25,233
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear
that "L" word you just used.

474
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:26,965
I'm a political facilitator.

475
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:30,975
You can pretend what you want, Jack.
But we are trying to handle a crisis here.

476
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:32,408
-Really, Mike?
-Yes.

477
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:36,073
It's time you started considering
that a President's first four-year term...

478
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:38,673
is what he's got to put up with,
to get elected again.

479
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:40,149
Tell me something I don't know.

480
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:43,711
<i>There is speculation that the White House</i>
<i>is in some disarray...</i>

481
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:48,694
<i>and that the President has become</i>
<i>politically immobilized by events....</i>

482
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:51,160
The bastards are trying to smoke us out.

483
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:52,921
Now look, people...

484
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,161
this President is going to end up
as confused as a goat on AstroTurf...

485
00:26:58,271 --> 00:27:00,967
-unless we are careful.
-Careful about what?

486
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:03,098
Every President has his foibles.

487
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:05,907
This one just needs a role model, okay?

488
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:08,546
I've been through this with him before...

489
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:11,310
that last crisis, that trade war thing.

490
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:15,917
We got him all fired up over Harry Truman
and it worked.

491
00:27:16,756 --> 00:27:17,814
When it ended...

492
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:21,416
I swear, I thought he was going to nuke
the Japs all over again.

493
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,353
On this one...

494
00:27:23,462 --> 00:27:26,590
we have to bring him up
to something more statesman-like.

495
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,561
Like Roosevelt.

496
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:31,227
Excellent question.

497
00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:34,731
What would Roosevelt have done
if he'd had this crisis?

498
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:37,474
Especially when they're playing
the orphan card.

499
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:40,910
-We should be playing our own orphan card.
-Exactly.

500
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:42,639
Sir.

501
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:45,645
What exactly is our "orphan card"?

502
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:54,217
Oh, Mr. President...

503
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:56,789
it's a deadline.

504
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,526
Precisely.
It's a deadline we're giving Idaho...

505
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:02,658
to get those damn orphans in there.

506
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:05,498
Seventy-two hours. No ifs, ands, or buts.

507
00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:08,206
Teddy Roosevelt would have played
the orphan card.

508
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:12,141
No, Mr. President. I was referring
to FDR, Franklin Roosevelt.

509
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,378
Teddy Roosevelt. When he led
the Rough Riders over the hill...

510
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:21,180
on that charge
when he declared war on Spain.

511
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:23,414
Now that was an orphan card!

512
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:27,517
Shit!

513
00:28:29,495 --> 00:28:33,795
I know something is going on, I can smell it
a mile away. Something's happening.

514
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,460
Caroline!

515
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:39,226
Did we fire that oddball techie,
Godfrey, in the last cutback?

516
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:41,203
No, his office is downstairs.

517
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:43,370
-What room?
-Fifty-five!

518
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:45,444
So, Tom comes up to me,
you know, Brokaw...

519
00:28:45,544 --> 00:28:48,911
and he says,
"Vincent, you belong on camera."

520
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:56,988
Godfrey, tell me you know something.
What's going on?

521
00:28:57,623 --> 00:28:58,988
BTUs.

522
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:03,421
This is something
I've been doing calculations on for months.

523
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:06,293
The Pentagon on a "normal" night...

524
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,458
taken from the infrared satellite
that I got us to buy time on.

525
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:12,662
You remember how the 22nd floor
didn't want to put money into it...

526
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:15,900
-that infrared was dead, microwave maybe--
-I remember, Godfrey...

527
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,067
I was thrilled for you. Go ahead.

528
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:20,540
On a normal night...

529
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:23,376
the Pentagon gives off
a fairly constant amount of heat.

530
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:26,178
About 3.28 million BTUs.

531
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:29,618
That's "British thermal units,"
it's a way of measuring how....

532
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,560
Here is how it looked 10 minutes ago.

533
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:38,596
You see this hot spot right here?

534
00:29:38,698 --> 00:29:40,996
All the lights and electrical equipment.

535
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,864
It added an extra half million BTUs.

536
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:45,162
So?

537
00:29:45,271 --> 00:29:46,829
I don't have a spectrum analysis.

538
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:50,102
They wouldn't authorize a system upgrade
at the last budget meeting.

539
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:53,736
Forget about spectrum analysis.
Stay with the BTUs...

540
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:57,111
and how they relate to the orphans.
That's why we're here.

541
00:29:57,216 --> 00:30:00,515
This is where they plan military operations.

542
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,048
Holy shit.

543
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:06,256
Look here.

544
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,752
North Carolina, half an hour ago.

545
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:13,226
You see this little area right here,
lit up like an infrared blowtorch?

546
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:17,502
What about it?

547
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:21,402
That's Fort Bragg.
Home of the 173rd Airborne.

548
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:24,902
Jesus Christ, we're gonna invade Idaho.

549
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:27,471
Over a bunch of orphans.

550
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,706
Get me to the White House.

551
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:32,375
I don't care if they have to use tear gas
to get the President out of there.

552
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:34,043
Who's at Fort Bragg?

553
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:38,021
<i>News Net has just learned</i>
<i>that two battalions from Fort Bragg...</i>

554
00:30:38,124 --> 00:30:41,093
<i>have been put on alert</i>
<i>and are preparing to be moved to Utah...</i>

555
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:44,128
<i>-near the Idaho border.</i>
<i>-...believe they're sending in troops?</i>

556
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,858
<i>They have a credibility gap</i>
<i>at Washington....</i>

557
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:51,760
<i>...two hours and you're telling me that</i>
<i>the White House is still denying reports...</i>

558
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:54,373
<i>that federal troops are being shipped</i>
<i>to the Idaho border?</i>

559
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:54,532
<i>that federal troops are being shipped</i>
<i>to the Idaho border?</i>

560
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,267
So, we're in the Eisenhower mode.

561
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,503
-Jack, I think lke's a great idea.
-Well, thank you, Mr. President.

562
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:01,443
Eisenhower had a calming influence.

563
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:03,071
Yes, I thought you'd like that, sir.

564
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:05,776
And he gave fabulous deadlines.

565
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:07,785
I saw the videos you gave me.

566
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:09,878
That's what I want to talk to you about, sir.

567
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:12,617
Seventy-two hours, three days.
Has a nice ring to it.

568
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:15,250
-That's the problem, sir.
-What is?

569
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:19,060
Seventy-two hours.
The end of 72 hours, I mean...

570
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:21,858
falls right in the middle of <i>All My Children.</i>

571
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:24,202
What the hell is <i>All My Children?</i>

572
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:25,736
It's a soap opera.

573
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:27,907
I mean, remember what happened last time
we preempted those soap operas?

574
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:29,932
I mean, remember what happened last time
we preempted those soap operas?

575
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:33,034
Women all over the country
went absolutely....

576
00:31:33,446 --> 00:31:34,811
Went crazy.

577
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:37,172
Jack, let's understand something.

578
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:41,743
I wasn't elected President to sit back
and watch the United States disintegrate.

579
00:31:41,854 --> 00:31:42,878
Hear, hear.

580
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:46,048
Sir, we lost the women's vote last time.

581
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,960
It shouldn't have happened.

582
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:52,459
It's Susan Lucci's final episode.

583
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:54,689
Now she's about to leave her husband.

584
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,097
Excuse me?

585
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:58,131
Susan, the star of <i>All My Children.</i>

586
00:31:58,237 --> 00:32:00,637
She's leaving her husband
to run off with Antonio.

587
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:02,263
-The gardener?
-Yes.

588
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:05,877
-Erica is running off with Antonio?
-Exactly.

589
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,079
Would it be possible that,
for the sake of the country...

590
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:14,209
Erica not run off with the gardener
for a few days?

591
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,687
Well, I checked with the network.
The episode's already been taped.

592
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,954
It airs in three days, right smack-dab
in the middle of our deadline.

593
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:27,332
Eisenhower would have
changed the deadline.

594
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,827
A soap opera, for Christ's sakes.

595
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:33,234
Since when does a soap opera
control the future of the country?

596
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,739
Why do you keep asking me if I love him?

597
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:40,073
Hey, I'm just trying to help.
I can see the pain you're in.

598
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:45,276
The pain is from you trying to get me back
into something that made me crazy.

599
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:48,315
Look, I only know what I see.

600
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,514
And I see you hurting more now
than you ever did before.

601
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:55,215
Well, tell me I'm wrong.
But I know I'm not, darling.

602
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:04,059
-Phone message, Jimmy, code blue.
-In a minute.

603
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:14,070
Governor, Ms. Fernandez is here
to discuss the News Net interview.

604
00:33:20,953 --> 00:33:23,114
-Which line is code blue?
-Three.

605
00:33:24,523 --> 00:33:26,821
Hello, Mrs. Farley. How are you?

606
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,858
Good. No, he's behind
closed doors right now.

607
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:36,195
Right, it's very important.
It's with a foreign dignitary.

608
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:38,058
Right.

609
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:41,796
No problem.
I'll have the fellows go shopping for you.

610
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:46,208
Right. The Popov vodka. Good. Bye.

611
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:54,080
You're all aware of the proclamations
coming from Idaho...

612
00:33:54,186 --> 00:33:57,155
where the Governor of the state
has said it is his intention...

613
00:33:57,256 --> 00:34:01,386
to close the borders
to a group of refugee children.

614
00:34:02,328 --> 00:34:04,421
This action is unconstitutional...

615
00:34:04,763 --> 00:34:07,288
and it represents
an illegal challenge to the...

616
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:09,765
<i>-authority of the federal government.</i>
-Amazing.

617
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:12,098
He's actually
gonna have to make a decision.

618
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:16,868
Christina, I don't care what you have to do
to get access to Farley. Do it.

619
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:23,448
-I love you so much.
-No, I don't believe you anymore.

620
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:27,110
I don't believe myself anymore.
What in hell am I doing with a married man?

621
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:30,814
-Eleanor and I have not lived--
-Lived as man and wife for three years!

622
00:34:30,923 --> 00:34:33,653
She doesn't understand you
and the check is in the mail...

623
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:36,227
-and I'm really Irish.
-This television is just....

624
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:39,092
<i>America's in danger of coming apart.</i>
<i>We need--</i>

625
00:34:39,465 --> 00:34:43,231
I just thought maybe we could go away
somewhere for a couple of days.

626
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:45,503
Let's just get away from all this.

627
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:49,233
<i>And I'm calling on Gov. Farley,</i>
<i>who I know is watching this...</i>

628
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:54,076
<i>-to recognize the hour of peril....</i>
-Christina, where are you? I need a reaction.

629
00:34:57,383 --> 00:35:00,045
Mel, I want a transfer.

630
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,120
Christina, this is not the appropriate time.

631
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:07,450
I wanna go somewhere and have babies
and lead a normal sane life...

632
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,528
and I wanna get up in the morning
and drive kids to school...

633
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:12,358
and I want a husband I can trust.

634
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:15,763
Please, no mommy-track crisis now.

635
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,893
Christina, please!

636
00:35:30,616 --> 00:35:34,313
<i>It was almost half a century ago</i>
<i>that another President...</i>

637
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:39,281
<i>Dwight D. Eisenhower, found it necessary</i>
<i>to use US troops...</i>

638
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:42,918
<i>to enforce the constitutional rights</i>
<i>of the federal government.</i>

639
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:46,225
<i>When the state of Arkansas</i>
<i>refused to obey...</i>

640
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:48,356
<i>a Supreme Court order.</i>

641
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:51,925
<i>If necessary, I will do the same.</i>

642
00:35:52,037 --> 00:35:54,870
<i>I am therefore declaring a deadline...</i>

643
00:35:54,973 --> 00:35:58,136
<i>of 67.5 hours from now.</i>

644
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:01,406
-Sixty-seven and a--
<i>-By this time, the Idaho must comply...</i>

645
00:36:01,513 --> 00:36:02,605
What the fuck is that?

646
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:05,878
<i>...with the constitutional prerogatives</i>
<i>of the federal government...</i>

647
00:36:05,984 --> 00:36:08,748
<i>of these United States of America...</i>

648
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:12,051
<i>-as they were delineated by our Founding....</i>
-What an asshole.

649
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:14,387
<i>-...and handed down....</i>
-That dumb son of a bitch.

650
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:18,088
Up to his ass in lobbyists and deals
to keep himself in power.

651
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:20,097
Now he tries to be Eisenhower.

652
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:23,633
Like a dwarf trying to be a high jumper.

653
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:26,470
God damn it!

654
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:30,237
How the hell did we let it all get to this?

655
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:33,638
Sixty-seven and a half hours, huh?

656
00:36:37,983 --> 00:36:39,712
Okay, do it.

657
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:41,816
Put up the roadblocks.

658
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:46,385
I promised, you know,
that News Net lady an exclusive.

659
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,556
You're supposed to brief Col. McNally, sir,
right away.

660
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:51,993
You know the one.

661
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:56,191
<i>I have today issued an executive order...</i>

662
00:36:56,301 --> 00:37:00,169
<i>-directing the use of troops....</i>
<i>-There have been comparisons made...</i>

663
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:03,639
<i>between the President and</i>
<i>former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.</i>

664
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:07,337
<i>It was in 1958</i>
<i>that Eisenhower sent in troops...</i>

665
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:10,938
<i>to forcibly integrate</i>
<i>the public schools in Little Rock.</i>

666
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:13,950
<i>Observers say</i>
<i>that the President's actions are....</i>

667
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:17,988
Okay, people, the whole country is tuned in.

668
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,584
Meaning it's prime time. For the next
three days, 24 hours a day...

669
00:37:22,694 --> 00:37:25,288
nobody goes home.
The beds are on their way.

670
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:29,424
Okay, everybody on deck?
Karachi, New York, The White House...

671
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:32,402
Boise. Who's on the Idaho border?

672
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:34,532
Vinnie.

673
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,398
-Vinnie? Vinnie Franco?
-Yeah.

674
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:53,880
Man. That John Wayne
was a hell of a soldier, huh?

675
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:56,187
Hey, Vinnie. He was an actor.

676
00:37:56,295 --> 00:38:00,891
If they'd put the Duke in charge of Vietnam,
we would've been out of that war in a week.

677
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:07,268
What are you doing turning the sound up?
You'll blow the speakers on this thing.

678
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:08,566
I didn't.

679
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:12,801
Shit!

680
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:26,086
Hello? Hey.

681
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,787
Hey, who are you guys?

682
00:38:32,197 --> 00:38:35,166
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

683
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:38,503
-I asked first.
-I ain't telling till you do.

684
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:40,699
We're a News Net crew.

685
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:42,467
-No kidding?
-Yeah.

686
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:47,105
Hey, Charlie, Sam, it's News Net.
We're gonna be on TV.

687
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:52,082
I'm Arnold Tooney Jr. Two "O's" in Tooney.

688
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:55,687
-I own a drugstore in Boise.
-Really?

689
00:38:56,154 --> 00:38:59,146
Well, I might be slow, Arnold,
but where I come from...

690
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:02,091
guys who own drugstores
don't drive around in tanks, you know.

691
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:05,129
Some of them do. On weekends, at least.

692
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:09,289
You're not the Army.
You're the National Guard.

693
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:12,297
Idaho National Guard? Oh, fuck.

694
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:17,135
Boys, looks like Idaho's going to war.

695
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:21,042
My God.

696
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:24,507
<i>I smell another fucking Emmy here.</i>

697
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:29,153
<i>There are 65 hours left</i>
<i>in the President's ultimatum.</i>

698
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:31,950
<i>There now exists the possibility</i>
<i>of American troops...</i>

699
00:39:32,057 --> 00:39:34,184
<i>fighting against other American troops...</i>

700
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:36,420
<i>for the first time since the Civil War.</i>

701
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:40,396
<i>Despite a complete press blackout</i>
<i>established by the military on both sides...</i>

702
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:43,297
<i>we're expecting exclusive coverage</i>
<i>of the tensions on the....</i>

703
00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:44,630
Civil War?

704
00:39:46,538 --> 00:39:47,903
The Second Civil War.

705
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:54,544
Get me graphics!

706
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:04,513
All right! Okay.

707
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:09,287
We have not sought,
nor will we instigate, any combat situation.

708
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:13,259
But I am hereby serving notice
on the federal government...

709
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:16,532
that should any
armed hostilities break out...

710
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:21,038
the state of Idaho will immediately
secede from the United States.

711
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,435
And with Gov. Farley's
dramatic declaration of secession...

712
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:30,504
America appears just days away
from a deepening crisis.

713
00:40:30,615 --> 00:40:34,676
Some observers fear the possibility
of an armed attack by federal troops.

714
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:38,347
An announcement from the White House
is expected within the hour.

715
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:42,821
Brendan, I'm going to need...

716
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,090
an Eisenhower kind of quote.

717
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:49,624
Something with a ring of leadership to it.

718
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:54,195
-An Eisenhower quote? I'll do me best, sir.
-I'm sure you will. Thank you very much.

719
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:04,310
Now, we're going to need
another Eisenhower quote.

720
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:07,451
So let's dream one up, lads.

721
00:41:07,953 --> 00:41:10,217
"Is blackmail. No blackmail.

722
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:13,624
-"We will not be party to such highhanded--"
-No.

723
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:18,690
How about this? "In my judgment, we've got
to call in the Army, because otherwise--"

724
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:24,796
"The flower of democracy
will not be trampled...

725
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:26,962
"under the foot of rebellion."

726
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:28,733
That's closer, Vaclav.

727
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,298
But still, I'm missing the poetry, boys.

728
00:41:32,744 --> 00:41:34,678
Raul, let's hear it, lad.

729
00:41:35,547 --> 00:41:38,744
"We must endure and we must prevail...

730
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:42,911
"if the slender thread of truth
is to remain woven into the fabric...

731
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:44,722
"of civilized life."

732
00:41:44,923 --> 00:41:47,790
"Slender thread of truth."

733
00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:52,761
<i>And just as Eisenhower said</i>
<i>years ago, "We must endure.</i>

734
00:41:52,864 --> 00:41:56,664
<i>"We must prevail,</i>
<i>if the slender thread of truth...</i>

735
00:41:56,768 --> 00:42:01,330
<i>"is to remain woven</i>
<i>into the fabric of civilized life. "

736
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:05,209
<i>It was with that sentiment that</i>
<i>my predecessor of so many years ago....</i>

737
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,540
That Eisenhower had a way with words.

738
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,140
<i>Washington continues to mobilize troops.</i>

739
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:14,776
<i>With 64 hours left,</i>
<i>two battalions from North Carolina...</i>

740
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:17,446
<i>an entire brigade from the First Infantry...</i>

741
00:42:17,722 --> 00:42:21,624
<i>and several armored companies</i>
<i>from Texas are being sent to Utah...</i>

742
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:23,751
<i>not far from the Idaho border.</i>

743
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:28,566
<i>Citizens from across that state are signing</i>
<i>up as volunteers in the National Guard.</i>

744
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:33,598
<i>Others are rallying around the various</i>
<i>private militias that support Gov. Farley.</i>

745
00:42:34,506 --> 00:42:36,906
Hi, folks. How's everybody doing?

746
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:43,608
Good. We're a News Net crew from...

747
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:45,579
New York City.

748
00:42:47,385 --> 00:42:51,116
Well, near New York.
It's practically New Jersey.

749
00:42:51,223 --> 00:42:55,387
We're here because we wanna tell
your side of the story.

750
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:58,827
Now I know you're probably
pretty suspicious of the media...

751
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,592
because of the way they've portrayed you
in the past.

752
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,000
They're always portraying you as these
sort of stereotypical, ultra-right-wing...

753
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:10,702
gun-crazed, union-busting whackos.

754
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:12,538
Good, Vinnie.

755
00:43:12,811 --> 00:43:14,711
But I'll tell you what.

756
00:43:15,013 --> 00:43:18,244
Let's take this opportunity to jump...

757
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:21,647
right over those left-wing, liberal...

758
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:26,122
East Coast, media elite types, and bring
your story right to the American people.

759
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,355
<i>And that's why I'm supporting Gov. Farley.</i>

760
00:43:29,895 --> 00:43:33,422
<i>The foreigners are taking our jobs,</i>
<i>and enough is enough.</i>

761
00:43:33,532 --> 00:43:35,500
<i>Because I want my grandson...</i>

762
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,060
<i>to live in a country where we don't owe</i>
<i>every cent to bankers around the world.</i>

763
00:43:40,172 --> 00:43:43,403
<i>I knew it was time</i>
<i>for me and my brother Alan here...</i>

764
00:43:43,508 --> 00:43:47,000
<i>to start buying missiles to defend our farm</i>
<i>from the federal government...</i>

765
00:43:47,112 --> 00:43:49,080
<i>that was trying to take all our guns away.</i>

766
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:52,309
<i>Once all the guns are gone,</i>
<i>who's gonna stand up to the people...</i>

767
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:54,681
<i>that are trying to take your freedom away?</i>

768
00:43:54,786 --> 00:43:58,415
Damn it! Christina, please don't do this.
Now, come here.

769
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:01,458
I've already done it. I've asked for a transfer.

770
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,527
Why?

771
00:44:02,627 --> 00:44:07,394
Because I'm Mexican.
I should be in Tijuana, not Boise.

772
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:09,592
-Please, please.
-Watch it.

773
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:12,898
Christina, don't let
all this national issue stuff...

774
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:14,801
screw things up between you and me.

775
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:18,569
And just because you're Mexican
is no reason to go crazy.

776
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:23,137
And I'm not just keeping back Mexicans.
It's everyone. From Afghans to Zambians.

777
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:26,911
Don't make this into a personal thing
between you and me. Come on.

778
00:44:27,018 --> 00:44:28,383
I feel sick.

779
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:32,251
-What's wrong, honey?
-I....

780
00:44:33,124 --> 00:44:35,183
I've been sick for three days.

781
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:36,921
I have to go.

782
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:40,822
Christina? Steve, get an ambulance.

783
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:43,560
No, I'm okay.

784
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:46,296
-I'm okay. I just--
-You sure?

785
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:48,901
You know who fucked it up?

786
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:52,306
Your mink coat do-gooders who
talk more about rights and duties...

787
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,810
-throwing money at every problem they see.
-Fuck you.

788
00:44:54,913 --> 00:44:57,643
Half the people I went to school with
can't get jobs now.

789
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:01,651
Seal the borders. Bring the jobs back.
There's more to life than cheap sneakers.

790
00:45:01,753 --> 00:45:03,983
This is not a fraternity. We're a news
network. We've got work to do.

791
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:07,024
I've got this idea that hits
exactly what you're talking about.

792
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,923
-What is it?
-The orphans, right?

793
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:12,087
Okay, Rachel, bring up JFK.

794
00:45:12,197 --> 00:45:16,065
You remember those old rock and rollers
from years ago sang <i>We Are the World?</i>

795
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:19,398
How about we get the old video
of them singing their hearts out.

796
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:23,634
Noble, caring humanity, world coming
together, a brighter day, and all that shit.

797
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:26,734
We intercut it with shots of these orphans.

798
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:29,981
These orphans are alive
but, hell, we can get some dead ones.

799
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:33,915
You cut back and forth between these
wonderful lyrics, maybe go instrumental...

800
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:37,785
like violins over the orphans.
Who in their right mind would ever...

801
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:41,017
tune that out and go to the
Home Shopping Network, I ask you?

802
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:43,094
Mel, the border just came alive.

803
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:45,355
It's a hell of an idea, Matthew. Work on it.

804
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:48,762
You could superimpose the face
of the rock musicians on the orphans...

805
00:45:48,867 --> 00:45:51,529
to make them look like
they're playing the instruments.

806
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:55,128
Or you could take the orphans' faces
and put them on the rock musicians...

807
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,606
and make them look like they're singing.

808
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:00,972
Or you could take a hologram
of one of the rock musicians...

809
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,206
and put him amongst the orphans.

810
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:05,613
A big Mexican crowd is heading
for the border....

811
00:46:05,717 --> 00:46:08,709
Mary Anne?

812
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:12,523
Is anybody listening to me in Brownsville?
Mary Anne, hello?

813
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:17,057
Mel, I'm having trouble hearing you.

814
00:46:17,796 --> 00:46:21,254
There's a huge number of Mexicans
pouring over the border.

815
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:23,458
I'm ready.

816
00:46:24,135 --> 00:46:26,968
<i>And these people streaming</i>
<i>across the Rio Grande...</i>

817
00:46:27,072 --> 00:46:31,532
<i>from Mexico into Texas are moving north</i>
<i>for the same reason as those in California...</i>

818
00:46:31,643 --> 00:46:33,508
<i>Arizona and New Mexico.</i>

819
00:46:33,645 --> 00:46:36,307
<i>A fear that Gov. Jim Farley's solution--</i>

820
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:38,381
<i>Why am I here in Boise?</i>

821
00:46:38,683 --> 00:46:41,811
<i>My parents crossed the border</i>
<i>just like those people are now.</i>

822
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,821
<i>I should be there on the border.</i>
<i>Not Mary Anne Wong.</i>

823
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,159
Christina, I can't have
Mexicans covering Mexicans...

824
00:46:48,259 --> 00:46:50,090
and Arabs covering Arabs.

825
00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:55,393
Mel, it's LA.

826
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,058
Later, Christina.

827
00:46:57,869 --> 00:46:59,928
Okay, people. Teamwork!

828
00:47:00,338 --> 00:47:04,240
<i>Let's go now to Los Angeles,</i>
<i>where the Mayor, Javier Clark, is speaking.</i>

829
00:47:13,518 --> 00:47:15,645
Oh shit.

830
00:47:15,754 --> 00:47:17,688
Where the hell is simultaneous translation?

831
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:21,247
-Where is Domingo?
-Domingo's wife is having a baby.

832
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,986
Christina?

833
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:28,554
-Christina, honey, I need you to--
<i>-Don't "honey" me.</i>

834
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:32,602
<i>-You cut me off.</i>
-It was a snafu, darling. Please listen to me.

835
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:37,004
We're patching up a feed from LA. Do me a
favor and do the simultaneous translation.

836
00:47:37,108 --> 00:47:39,269
<i>I'm a reporter, not a translator.</i>

837
00:47:39,377 --> 00:47:42,471
Christina, I'm begging you, okay?

838
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,639
For all that we've meant to each other?

839
00:47:44,749 --> 00:47:49,083
<i>All we've meant to each other?</i>
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

840
00:47:49,254 --> 00:47:51,154
<i>Never.</i>

841
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:56,552
And there is no question
of the so-called border...

842
00:47:56,661 --> 00:47:59,027
being closed unless we agree...

843
00:47:59,397 --> 00:48:04,266
just because Mr. Farley and his Anglos
want to set the clock back...

844
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:07,827
and keep us in our place
for the next two centuries.

845
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:12,435
Whatever the politicians up north wanna do,
that's their problem, but...

846
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:14,540
here it's different.

847
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:17,581
The border is no longer
just a matter for Washington...

848
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:20,617
or the <i>Señor</i> Farleys of the world. No.

849
00:48:20,718 --> 00:48:23,687
<i>We have as much to say over the border...</i>

850
00:48:23,788 --> 00:48:26,154
<i>as any bureaucrat in Washington.</i>

851
00:48:26,257 --> 00:48:30,523
<i>See, Los Angeles is not simply</i>
<i>American territory anymore.</i>

852
00:48:30,628 --> 00:48:32,960
<i>I mean, just listen to our name.</i>

853
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:36,156
-What's she doing?
<i>-Does that sound like an English....</i>

854
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:38,758
Letting us all know how much you've
meant to each other?

855
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:42,738
<i>...or Las Vegas? No. These are the names</i>
<i>that our people gave them...</i>

856
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:45,435
<i>before the lands were ripped</i>
<i>from their ancestors...</i>

857
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:48,011
<i>and distributed among the Anglos.</i>

858
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:03,582
Yeah. Who do we have there? Anybody?

859
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:05,185
Mohammed Amin.

860
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:10,232
<i>The roof. Snipers.</i>

861
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,998
<i>We are trying to establish contact</i>
<i>with reporter Mohammed Amin.</i>

862
00:49:19,377 --> 00:49:20,344
<i>Mohammed?</i>

863
00:49:20,445 --> 00:49:23,505
<i>Helena, you've seen the shooting.</i>
<i>It is still going on.</i>

864
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:26,778
<i>I saw three, maybe four snipers on the roof.</i>

865
00:49:26,885 --> 00:49:29,911
<i>One was wearing the colors</i>
<i>of one of the city's black gangs...</i>

866
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:34,651
<i>that have said that they will stop the Latinos</i>
<i>from completely taking over Los Angeles.</i>

867
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:35,987
<i>The black gangs have said...</i>

868
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:39,325
<i>that they will not recognize</i>
<i>Mexican authority here.</i>

869
00:49:39,764 --> 00:49:42,358
<i>-Does anybody here speak English?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

870
00:49:43,535 --> 00:49:44,502
<i>No.</i>

871
00:49:44,602 --> 00:49:46,627
<i>Anybody? Arabic?</i>

872
00:49:52,477 --> 00:49:54,968
That is why I'm closing the damn border.

873
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,547
Governor, Col. McNally on the phone.

874
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:03,411
Governor.

875
00:50:03,988 --> 00:50:06,923
We can see two busloads of orphans
being unloaded...

876
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:09,255
the other side of the border here.

877
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,658
I just want to clarify our mission
with respect to these children.

878
00:50:14,632 --> 00:50:15,929
What do we do...

879
00:50:16,034 --> 00:50:19,070
if they march them up
between us and the federal troops?

880
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:28,504
<i>You could always tell</i>
<i>when a crisis started really affecting us.</i>

881
00:50:29,681 --> 00:50:33,913
<i>When it gets too close to home,</i>
<i>all the bad-taste jokes cease.</i>

882
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:37,181
<i>And when the orphans move up</i>
<i>to the Idaho border...</i>

883
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:41,054
<i>people start looking harder at the images</i>
<i>of those kids...</i>

884
00:50:42,193 --> 00:50:43,558
<i>of the soldiers...</i>

885
00:50:44,596 --> 00:50:46,962
<i>and of ordinary people like themselves.</i>

886
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:51,734
What are they doing bringing orphans
to a war zone?

887
00:50:51,836 --> 00:50:54,236
For Christ's sake, shut up.
We're taping, you moron.

888
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:57,536
-Give this one a piece of my mind--
-Don't go down there.

889
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:00,841
<i>Come on, fellas!</i>

890
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,213
Eddie, What's going on?

891
00:51:04,315 --> 00:51:06,146
Show me a picture.
What's happening there?

892
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,808
<i>Eddie, you cocksucker!</i>

893
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:11,288
<i>Hey, Mel.</i>

894
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:16,421
<i>You know, we were just looking</i>
<i>for my contact lens.</i>

895
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:19,656
<i>-Here it is.</i>
<i>-Great.</i>

896
00:51:19,864 --> 00:51:22,196
<i>-See? All right. I guess we're ready then.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

897
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,892
<i>All right. Let's shoot.</i>

898
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:25,402
Idiots.

899
00:51:26,738 --> 00:51:30,401
And with no sign that the deadline
will be extended by the President...

900
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:32,908
both sides are hardening their positions.

901
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:35,980
<i>Federal troops are arriving</i>
<i>at Hill Air Base in northern Utah.</i>

902
00:51:37,448 --> 00:51:40,349
<i>So far, more than 8,000</i>
<i>combat-ready troops are there...</i>

903
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:42,919
<i>under the command of Gen. Charles Buford.</i>

904
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:46,646
Move, y'all.

905
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:49,921
<i>Buford was second-in-command</i>
<i>of the Army unit sent into Algeria...</i>

906
00:51:50,028 --> 00:51:52,326
<i>to rescue the hundreds</i>
<i>of American oil workers...</i>

907
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:55,092
<i>facing execution by Islamic fundamentalists.</i>

908
00:52:23,628 --> 00:52:27,394
What the hell is he doing?

909
00:52:59,397 --> 00:53:02,696
I've been waiting 12 years for this,
candy-ass.

910
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:04,131
Hey, Chuck.

911
00:53:04,736 --> 00:53:07,261
-Fuck you.
-No, you ain't.

912
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:10,465
Not after what you did to us
in the Persian Gulf.

913
00:53:11,676 --> 00:53:15,442
You puffed-up piece of shit,
if you hadn't been chasing headlines--

914
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:18,447
I was supposed to get into Kuwait city first.

915
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:20,073
It was mine, God damn it!

916
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:22,618
Whose fault was it that you stopped...

917
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,689
for an interview with <i>ABC News?</i>

918
00:53:25,857 --> 00:53:28,348
And you lied to me
about your position, didn't you?

919
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:30,984
Of course I did, Chuck. It was a race.

920
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:33,494
And I got to Kuwait first.

921
00:53:33,865 --> 00:53:35,332
Well, fuck you.

922
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:38,664
You're kind of a sore loser,
aren't you, shithead?

923
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:41,363
<i>We have a picture now. No audio, however.</i>

924
00:53:41,572 --> 00:53:44,837
There's an incredible dignity
to something like this.

925
00:53:44,942 --> 00:53:46,170
There is.

926
00:53:46,644 --> 00:53:51,240
Two military commanders facing each other
across a gulf of human passion.

927
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:56,478
It's like Gen. Lee and Gen. Grant meeting
after the Civil War.

928
00:53:56,954 --> 00:54:00,253
And Lincoln would've been waiting
for Grant to report back to him.

929
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:04,158
Wouldn't Lincoln have been dead
by the time Lee and Grant met?

930
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:06,122
Whatever.

931
00:54:07,698 --> 00:54:09,427
There's something compelling...

932
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:12,731
something eloquent about those two.

933
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:15,805
Blow it out your ass, you prick.

934
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:17,568
Fuck you, asshole.

935
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:19,536
Go find your mama.

936
00:54:27,752 --> 00:54:30,846
Intake to C-SAT 4.

937
00:54:30,955 --> 00:54:31,922
Damn it!

938
00:54:32,023 --> 00:54:33,923
They better be recording this.

939
00:54:34,325 --> 00:54:35,349
Where's it coming from?

940
00:54:35,459 --> 00:54:37,256
The Alamo. It's Tricia Lee.

941
00:54:37,662 --> 00:54:39,391
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

942
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:45,027
<i>The Alamo. They've blown up the Alamo.</i>

943
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:48,869
<i>There are crowds of people all around.</i>

944
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:50,907
<i>It's like a celebration.</i>

945
00:54:58,449 --> 00:54:59,416
Wow.

946
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:09,823
Do you speak English?
I don't understand you.

947
00:55:10,828 --> 00:55:11,795
<i>Ingles?</i>

948
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:16,924
Alamo gone.
Don't need to speak <i>Ingles</i> no more.

949
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,301
They trashed the Alamo.

950
00:55:21,806 --> 00:55:24,673
Davy Crockett.
He whipped the Mexicans there.

951
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,971
What comic book do you get
your information from?

952
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,876
Crockett wasn't even on the winning team.

953
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:32,242
Davy Crockett was a hero.

954
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,113
Only reason Davy Crockett's a hero is...

955
00:55:34,218 --> 00:55:37,483
'cause Disney figured out
how to make a buck off those hats.

956
00:55:37,622 --> 00:55:39,749
Federal troops moving toward Idaho.

957
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:52,903
Governor.

958
00:55:57,341 --> 00:55:59,172
Spent the night here last night, huh?

959
00:55:59,277 --> 00:56:01,905
Yeah, I was thinking
of that beautiful piece of land...

960
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:04,846
I want to buy out by the lake,
the one with its own boat dock.

961
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:05,938
Is that still available?

962
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,642
We got an escalation problem.

963
00:56:07,752 --> 00:56:09,185
I should've bought it.

964
00:56:09,287 --> 00:56:12,347
I'd love to go up there
for a few days with Christina.

965
00:56:12,723 --> 00:56:16,250
The feds have stopped their troops
less than a mile from our border.

966
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,885
We gotta get to the media
and seize moral high ground.

967
00:56:18,996 --> 00:56:21,328
I'm getting damn tired
of all this moral high ground.

968
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:22,421
Oh, shit.

969
00:56:22,533 --> 00:56:25,661
I prefer rolling in the mud.
You meet more interesting people there.

970
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:26,737
It's immediate.

971
00:56:26,837 --> 00:56:28,668
I'm sick of the goddamn media.

972
00:56:28,773 --> 00:56:31,571
That's how we got in this mess
in the first place.

973
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:35,741
If Moses had public opinion polls
and TV cameras to contend with...

974
00:56:35,846 --> 00:56:37,837
he never would've led his people
out of Egypt.

975
00:56:37,949 --> 00:56:40,008
Look, Governor, we got no choice.

976
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:42,618
All the troops in the world ain't
worth a squirrel's dick...

977
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,915
unless we got those media whores
kissing our ass.

978
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:46,148
That's the problem.

979
00:56:46,257 --> 00:56:50,785
People are terrified of being called racist
for trying to preserve their own culture.

980
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:54,894
Yeah. Hold on.

981
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:57,394
They wanna know
what you want for breakfast.

982
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:59,731
-The usual.
-Fajitas.

983
00:57:00,972 --> 00:57:04,032
Matthew, Helena, these units
from the 173rd Airborne...

984
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:06,268
suddenly began taking up positions here...

985
00:57:06,377 --> 00:57:09,073
shortly after the news of the Alamo
came through.

986
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,672
I'm talking to from just inside Utah,
very close to the border with Idaho.

987
00:57:14,185 --> 00:57:16,449
To my right is the encampment
of Pakistani orphans...

988
00:57:16,554 --> 00:57:20,854
where, according to our information,
busloads more are expected to arrive today.

989
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:25,752
General, I know you don't trust the media.
I'm with you 100% on that, absolutely.

990
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:28,093
But I think
you're missing the opportunity here...

991
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:31,430
to counterattack what's being said
about you by these militia nuts...

992
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,400
and these opportunistic politicians--

993
00:57:33,504 --> 00:57:35,131
Mr. Franco...

994
00:57:35,573 --> 00:57:38,235
you and the rest of your ilk...

995
00:57:38,743 --> 00:57:41,974
are a carbuncle on the ass of the military.

996
00:57:43,147 --> 00:57:47,516
"Carbuncle."
I'll try and put a good spin on that word.

997
00:57:47,618 --> 00:57:49,586
I'm sure you mean it
as a kind of compliment.

998
00:57:49,687 --> 00:57:52,713
I ordered the media out of this sector,
and that includes you.

999
00:57:52,823 --> 00:57:55,758
What about that great press I gave you
during the Persian Gulf--

1000
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,259
Get out of here!

1001
00:57:57,595 --> 00:57:58,562
Okay.

1002
00:58:00,931 --> 00:58:03,923
It's too bad, though.
I was gonna give you this present.

1003
00:58:04,035 --> 00:58:05,798
I guess I can give it to somebody else.

1004
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:08,997
It's a tape of you in that
Panama whorehouse a couple of years ago.

1005
00:58:09,106 --> 00:58:10,903
If you don't mind my saying so, General...

1006
00:58:11,008 --> 00:58:14,000
you didn't have any carbuncles
on your ass that night.

1007
00:58:16,113 --> 00:58:18,604
Are there any more copies of that tape?

1008
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:23,551
<i>Protests supporting both sides</i>
<i>of the Idaho conflict...</i>

1009
00:58:23,654 --> 00:58:27,317
<i>are increasing all over the country</i>
<i>in the wake of the bombing of the Alamo.</i>

1010
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:30,553
<i>As government officials fear</i>
<i>more serious outbreaks of violence...</i>

1011
00:58:30,661 --> 00:58:34,256
<i>there is trouble from an unexpected source</i>
<i>on the Idaho-Utah border.</i>

1012
00:58:34,365 --> 00:58:35,923
<i>Blaine Gorman has more.</i>

1013
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:39,860
<i>Matthew, Helena, the Sioux Indians</i>
<i>on this reservation have issued...</i>

1014
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:42,734
<i>a statement saying that this conflict is,</i>
<i>and I quote:</i>

1015
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,003
<i>"Part of the white man's war</i>
<i>that we will not be drawn into. "

1016
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:47,907
<i>In fact, they too, like Gov. Farley...</i>

1017
00:58:48,012 --> 00:58:50,242
<i>are closing the borders</i>
<i>to their big reservations.</i>

1018
00:58:50,347 --> 00:58:53,248
<i>The Indians are receiving support</i>
<i>from dozens of other bands...</i>

1019
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,318
<i>all across America, many of whom....</i>

1020
00:58:55,419 --> 00:58:57,478
It's getting to be a tad ridiculous.

1021
00:58:57,588 --> 00:59:00,751
Mr. President, I mean,
a bunch of Indians on the warpath....

1022
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:03,190
If I may be so blunt, who gives a shit?

1023
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:04,528
We do.

1024
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:08,731
That reservation is right smack
between our troops and the Idaho border.

1025
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:13,096
The Sioux. Aren't they the ones
who wiped out Gen. Custer?

1026
00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:15,138
Yes, sir. Not far from there.

1027
00:59:15,473 --> 00:59:18,704
Well, I'm not going to have
another Gen. Custer on my hands.

1028
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:23,477
I intend to take the appropriate action
to ensure this does not happen!

1029
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,476
Can't we just let them
have another casino or something?

1030
00:59:34,024 --> 00:59:35,184
<i>This is News Net.</i>

1031
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:40,130
<i>Good evening, I'm Matthew Langford.</i>

1032
00:59:40,231 --> 00:59:41,789
<i>And I'm Helena Newman.</i>

1033
00:59:42,032 --> 00:59:44,523
<i>There are now less than 41 hours left...</i>

1034
00:59:44,635 --> 00:59:46,899
<i>in the countdown to the Idaho crisis.</i>

1035
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:51,207
<i>And the White House has announced</i>
<i>the granting of gambling licenses...</i>

1036
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:55,404
<i>to the Lakota Sioux Indian Tribe</i>
<i>for a casino next to the Little Bighorn...</i>

1037
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:57,939
<i>where Gen. Custer was killed....</i>

1038
00:59:58,249 --> 00:59:59,648
Is nothing sacred?

1039
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,685
Next, they'll be paving Gettysburg.
Or worse, Disneyland.

1040
01:00:02,786 --> 01:00:05,050
Jim Kalla, I need you in Washington.

1041
01:00:08,826 --> 01:00:11,852
<i>More than anything else,</i>
<i>what the Idaho crisis has done...</i>

1042
01:00:11,962 --> 01:00:15,227
<i>is to highlight all the factions,</i>
<i>all the divisions in America.</i>

1043
01:00:15,332 --> 01:00:17,300
<i>And nowhere are they closer to</i>
<i>the surface...</i>

1044
01:00:17,401 --> 01:00:19,767
<i>than in the House of Representatives</i>
<i>in Washington.</i>

1045
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:22,270
I'm out here! If you got a problem....

1046
01:00:22,373 --> 01:00:26,810
<i>It's become kind of a political bazaar</i>
<i>built on the ruins of the melting pot.</i>

1047
01:00:27,511 --> 01:00:29,604
Translator, come over here!

1048
01:00:29,813 --> 01:00:31,610
What the hell's he saying?

1049
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,081
We don't like the deals other groups...

1050
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:36,619
and the Nation of Islam are making
against us Chinese.

1051
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,188
Hey, man, this is Washington!
This is what we do here!

1052
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,882
Make deals! Do you understand that?

1053
01:00:40,991 --> 01:00:43,084
<i>The situation here changes hourly.</i>

1054
01:00:43,194 --> 01:00:46,561
<i>What this crisis comes down to</i>
<i>is wheeling and dealing.</i>

1055
01:00:47,097 --> 01:00:50,760
<i>Most of it orchestrated by the White House</i>
<i>and Kenya Nkomo...</i>

1056
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:53,335
<i>the leader of the Nation of Islam caucus.</i>

1057
01:00:53,437 --> 01:00:55,200
<i>Before being elected to Congress...</i>

1058
01:00:55,306 --> 01:00:58,833
<i>he made his name on the streets</i>
<i>of Los Angeles as a feared gang leader.</i>

1059
01:01:00,678 --> 01:01:02,373
<i>Every party is demanding concessions...</i>

1060
01:01:03,614 --> 01:01:05,741
<i>...in exchange</i>
<i>for supporting the President...</i>

1061
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:08,283
<i>if he needs to use force against Idaho.</i>

1062
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:11,718
<i>Now I'm standing here</i>
<i>next to Congressman Singh of Alabama.</i>

1063
01:01:11,822 --> 01:01:15,121
<i>Congressman Singh, what concession</i>
<i>did you get from the White House?</i>

1064
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:16,887
<i>A great deal for my people.</i>

1065
01:01:16,994 --> 01:01:19,360
<i>I told Mr. Buchan from the White House:</i>

1066
01:01:19,697 --> 01:01:22,495
<i>"Y'all want our support against Idaho, fine.</i>

1067
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:26,131
<i>"But y'all have to give us</i>
<i>3,000 acres in Alabama...</i>

1068
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:28,262
<i>"and money to build our temples. "

1069
01:01:28,672 --> 01:01:31,539
<i>And he said, "No problem. " So, no problem.</i>

1070
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:35,173
<i>No problem. Jim Kalla, News Net.</i>

1071
01:01:46,657 --> 01:01:49,854
Can't make an omelet
without busting some sacred eggs.

1072
01:01:52,029 --> 01:01:53,724
We're making history here.

1073
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:58,735
And you ain't with us, are you?

1074
01:02:00,537 --> 01:02:01,663
No, I'm not.

1075
01:02:02,172 --> 01:02:03,400
You should be.

1076
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:06,576
Why not?

1077
01:02:07,745 --> 01:02:09,975
Maybe because I'm a reporter.

1078
01:02:10,848 --> 01:02:12,338
I ain't with anybody.

1079
01:02:13,217 --> 01:02:16,550
Maybe because too many sacred eggs
are getting busted.

1080
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:21,883
See, I rode the buses back in the '60s
to bring people together.

1081
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:24,486
Pretty unfashionable now, isn't it?

1082
01:02:32,736 --> 01:02:36,263
Your wife. She's Jewish, ain't she?

1083
01:02:40,444 --> 01:02:43,277
You know, I forgot what she is.

1084
01:02:44,114 --> 01:02:47,311
All I remember
is that we met on the back of a bus.

1085
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:52,821
Hey, is the Governor in the car?

1086
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:55,950
Well, anybody seen him?

1087
01:02:56,493 --> 01:02:59,860
I'll be dipped in dog shit.
Where the hell are you?

1088
01:03:01,098 --> 01:03:02,360
Son of a bitch!

1089
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:07,504
Governor.

1090
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:13,669
Oh, Jesus Christ, Governor! Scoot over.

1091
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:18,074
I've been looking all over hell for you--

1092
01:03:18,182 --> 01:03:21,743
She always parks right over there.
You see that empty parking space?

1093
01:03:21,852 --> 01:03:22,944
That's her.

1094
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:25,851
Governor, we've got crisis after crisis
going on in there--

1095
01:03:25,956 --> 01:03:29,153
You want to know about crisis, Jimmy?
She won't even look at me now.

1096
01:03:29,259 --> 01:03:30,226
Jesus.

1097
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:37,266
There she is.

1098
01:03:42,506 --> 01:03:43,473
Governor.

1099
01:03:45,476 --> 01:03:47,171
I knew she'd come back.

1100
01:03:58,455 --> 01:04:00,423
What the hell is she doing?

1101
01:04:05,629 --> 01:04:07,654
Christina, are you all right?

1102
01:04:11,802 --> 01:04:13,793
Christina, are you all right?

1103
01:04:13,904 --> 01:04:16,202
No. Not really.

1104
01:04:16,306 --> 01:04:18,536
What were you doing behind that tree?

1105
01:04:20,811 --> 01:04:22,108
I was barfing.

1106
01:04:23,046 --> 01:04:24,513
I have to go.

1107
01:04:28,752 --> 01:04:30,117
What's going on?

1108
01:04:31,588 --> 01:04:33,055
She's pregnant.

1109
01:04:34,391 --> 01:04:36,325
I'm going to be a father.

1110
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:39,319
And if it's a boy...

1111
01:04:40,063 --> 01:04:43,089
we're gonna call it Juan Pablo Farley.

1112
01:04:54,378 --> 01:04:56,141
I got you hooked up again.

1113
01:04:57,581 --> 01:04:59,515
-It was a faulty switch.
-Great.

1114
01:05:00,517 --> 01:05:02,712
-I owe you one.
-No, you don't.

1115
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:05,144
How's Arla doing?

1116
01:05:06,356 --> 01:05:10,019
-She has good days and bad days.
-What did the doctor say?

1117
01:05:10,928 --> 01:05:12,418
Nothing I wanna hear.

1118
01:05:14,598 --> 01:05:16,293
-Say hello for me.
-I will.

1119
01:05:25,409 --> 01:05:27,468
I came across another great line.

1120
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:33,115
"The best lack all conviction, while
the worst are full of passionate intensity."

1121
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:36,946
That is a good line.

1122
01:05:37,054 --> 01:05:40,956
The poets. Nobody pays enough attention
to the poets anymore.

1123
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:44,160
Good night, Godfrey.

1124
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:54,599
Hey, what the hell's going on?

1125
01:05:55,439 --> 01:05:56,906
Moving them out.

1126
01:05:58,342 --> 01:06:03,109
Oh, man. Jesus Christ!
Come on. Enough is enough.

1127
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,983
You know what? I've had it with you.
All you do is use the wide-angle lens.

1128
01:06:14,091 --> 01:06:16,889
It will look like there's less orphans
than there really is.

1129
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:20,361
Lady, I don't have an orphan lens, okay?
I use a normal everyday lens--

1130
01:06:20,464 --> 01:06:22,523
Yeah, if we were
the Save the Children Fund...

1131
01:06:22,633 --> 01:06:25,693
you wouldn't use a wide-angle lens,
you'd use a telephoto lens.

1132
01:06:25,802 --> 01:06:28,737
-Fine. You're a big expert, right?
-Yes, I am. Thank you.

1133
01:06:28,839 --> 01:06:31,831
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about media, asshole.

1134
01:06:31,942 --> 01:06:33,500
Fuck reality, this is image!

1135
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,078
Fuck the media,
these kids shouldn't be near the border.

1136
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:39,615
Yeah? If these kids were not near
the border, you wouldn't have a story.

1137
01:06:39,716 --> 01:06:42,776
It is my constitutional right to do as I see fit.

1138
01:06:42,886 --> 01:06:45,320
You know what, you are a fascist.
You know that?

1139
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:47,583
-I'm a fascist?
-Yeah. How do you feel about that?

1140
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:48,715
That's what you...

1141
01:06:48,825 --> 01:06:50,884
<i>call everybody</i>
<i>who doesn't think the way you do.</i>

1142
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:53,053
Blaine, I want you to give that idiot
a message.

1143
01:06:53,163 --> 01:06:56,655
You tell him
that you never get in the middle of a story.

1144
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:57,756
<i>He's fired!</i>

1145
01:06:57,868 --> 01:07:00,598
Burgess is going crazy.
He says you're fired again.

1146
01:07:00,704 --> 01:07:04,800
Really? Fuck it! I'm done. I'm out.

1147
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:08,944
-Will you do us a favor and just shut up?
-That's all we do around here, Blaine.

1148
01:07:09,046 --> 01:07:10,445
We're in the news business.

1149
01:07:10,547 --> 01:07:12,674
We're a wall of noise, Blaine.
Wake the fuck up.

1150
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:14,216
You know what, I quit! I'm done.

1151
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:16,218
I'm going to New York, going to tie one on.

1152
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,151
I'm gonna finish that novel I started.

1153
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:20,951
It's a big enough piece of shit
to become a bestseller.

1154
01:07:21,058 --> 01:07:22,793
Then I'm gonna take the money,
move to the Bahamas...

1155
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:23,384
Then I'm gonna take the money,
move to the Bahamas...

1156
01:07:23,493 --> 01:07:26,189
the only time I'll see you guys
is when I'm channel surfing.

1157
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:28,127
I quit. Fuck you, fuck him, everybody!

1158
01:07:28,231 --> 01:07:30,358
That's too bad, we could've used you.

1159
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:33,664
I hear Mel's thinking of bringing in
one those young CNN producers.

1160
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:34,737
What?

1161
01:07:35,472 --> 01:07:37,337
Yeah. That's what I heard.

1162
01:07:38,275 --> 01:07:39,242
Really?

1163
01:07:48,218 --> 01:07:49,185
Fuck!

1164
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:54,015
Come on, we got a lot of work to do,
let's go.

1165
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:58,888
It is our understanding that Gen. Buford
has been ordered to march the orphans...

1166
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:00,588
to the border and formally demand...

1167
01:08:00,697 --> 01:08:03,530
that Gov. Jim Farley allow them passage
into Idaho.

1168
01:08:03,634 --> 01:08:06,228
Clearly, Gov. Farley
is going to be the man of the hour.

1169
01:08:16,647 --> 01:08:20,879
Governor, you really want to get down
off that ledge, you don't want to be slipping.

1170
01:08:20,984 --> 01:08:22,975
I'm terrified of heights myself.

1171
01:08:23,387 --> 01:08:24,684
Oh, shit!

1172
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:27,281
Look at that commotion down there.

1173
01:08:27,991 --> 01:08:31,586
News crews, National Guard, crowds.

1174
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:34,626
I just realized something. I created that.

1175
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:37,928
You sure did, now why don't you
just come down there off the edge?

1176
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:41,129
-You could slip.
-I love the edge, that's where life is.

1177
01:08:41,638 --> 01:08:43,970
I know that about you, Governor,
that's for sure.

1178
01:08:44,074 --> 01:08:48,374
Ain't nothing ever happens in the middle.
The edge, that's where it all happens.

1179
01:08:48,478 --> 01:08:50,173
You still fuck your wife?

1180
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,211
-What?
-Yeah, after a few years, it fades.

1181
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:56,181
The mating urge, I mean.

1182
01:08:56,687 --> 01:08:59,986
I haven't slept with Eleanor for three years.

1183
01:09:01,024 --> 01:09:03,925
-We're all just animals, you know.
-I know that, Governor.

1184
01:09:04,027 --> 01:09:07,121
But, the White House has federal troops
coming in--

1185
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,255
Scratching for our little piece of turf.

1186
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:13,564
Mating like animals for a few years, all
in the name of that thing called romance...

1187
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,137
and then it fades.

1188
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:19,035
The males have to go looking
somewhere else to plant their seed.

1189
01:09:19,142 --> 01:09:20,404
Oh, Jesus!

1190
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:23,478
Juan Pablo Farley!

1191
01:09:24,347 --> 01:09:27,214
John Paul in Spanish.
Named after the last pope.

1192
01:09:27,317 --> 01:09:30,445
Look, Governor, I don't think we want
to get into that right now.

1193
01:09:30,554 --> 01:09:33,717
Our Guard is keeping out
about a million Juan Pablos right now.

1194
01:09:33,824 --> 01:09:36,190
Hell, yes!
That's because there is a million of them.

1195
01:09:36,293 --> 01:09:40,286
But one single Juan Pablo,
one cute little kid...

1196
01:09:40,997 --> 01:09:44,455
one future leader
who'll take our nation to greatness...

1197
01:09:44,568 --> 01:09:47,264
you telling me we keep him out, my son?

1198
01:09:48,638 --> 01:09:51,198
No way, José!

1199
01:10:00,584 --> 01:10:02,051
-Jack.
-Yes, sir.

1200
01:10:02,152 --> 01:10:03,619
Who allowed the media in here?

1201
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,850
It's better to have them inside the tent
pissing out, than outside pissing in.

1202
01:10:11,895 --> 01:10:14,261
All right, let's start at the beginning.

1203
01:10:14,731 --> 01:10:17,757
How the hell do we stop this thing?
It's already gone too far.

1204
01:10:17,868 --> 01:10:20,894
We can order Gen. Buford
to withdraw all his troops.

1205
01:10:21,004 --> 01:10:22,437
That's weakness.

1206
01:10:22,539 --> 01:10:26,703
Well, then we can wait for the deadline
and attack.

1207
01:10:27,177 --> 01:10:29,975
-Madness.
-Well, if it's one thing or the other...

1208
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,344
I know which one I would choose.

1209
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,315
Mr. President...

1210
01:10:35,252 --> 01:10:38,688
the public hates weakness,
shows up in all the polls.

1211
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:45,428
Well, we've got another problem
and you're not gonna want to hear it.

1212
01:10:45,529 --> 01:10:49,590
When we set these deadlines, we were
presuming that it wouldn't go this far.

1213
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:52,067
If the shit hits the fan...

1214
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:55,961
it's gonna wind up
spilling over into <i>All My Children.</i>

1215
01:10:56,439 --> 01:10:57,736
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1216
01:11:04,714 --> 01:11:06,944
Mel, I'm trying to find Vinnie.

1217
01:11:07,317 --> 01:11:10,184
He took the minicam,
said he smelled a better story.

1218
01:11:11,221 --> 01:11:13,348
I gotta go, they're moving out now.

1219
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:28,371
Mel, you dim-witted schmuck,
it's me, your favorite person in the world.

1220
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:32,308
Vinnie! How're you doing? Where are you?

1221
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:34,934
Palm Beach? Basking in Malibu?

1222
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:38,905
On the Idaho side, about to send the most
important shots of the crisis.

1223
01:11:39,015 --> 01:11:41,916
<i>You know something,</i>
<i>I don't even know why I'm talking to you.</i>

1224
01:11:42,018 --> 01:11:44,680
If I'm not mistaken, you were fired.

1225
01:11:44,888 --> 01:11:47,823
Really? That's great.
Now that I'm a freelancer, that means...

1226
01:11:47,924 --> 01:11:52,384
you got to pay me a whole lot of money
for these shots or hire me back with a raise.

1227
01:11:52,662 --> 01:11:55,631
-Vinnie, there is zero probability of that.
<i>-Yeah?</i>

1228
01:11:56,633 --> 01:11:58,601
Take a look at this, my friend.

1229
01:12:01,304 --> 01:12:02,862
That's cowboy boots.

1230
01:12:03,273 --> 01:12:05,241
What does that have to do with anything?

1231
01:12:05,342 --> 01:12:06,775
The gonzo has lost his mind.

1232
01:12:06,877 --> 01:12:09,243
Wait. Vinnie, it's Jim.

1233
01:12:09,713 --> 01:12:11,510
Move in on the shoulder patches.

1234
01:12:11,615 --> 01:12:13,879
<i>Excuse me,</i>
<i>would you mind turning around?</i>

1235
01:12:13,984 --> 01:12:17,181
<i>Jim, you're on the verge</i>
<i>of breaking the code, I can tell.</i>

1236
01:12:17,587 --> 01:12:20,522
Since when have you ever seen
cowboy boots on a Guardsman...

1237
01:12:20,624 --> 01:12:24,082
except in that piece we had last year
about that goofiness in Montana.

1238
01:12:24,194 --> 01:12:26,253
Montana?
What's that have to do with anything?

1239
01:12:26,363 --> 01:12:27,921
Look at the shoulder patches.

1240
01:12:28,031 --> 01:12:29,862
Montana National Guard.

1241
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,058
<i>Told you. Now look here.</i>

1242
01:12:32,168 --> 01:12:34,762
<i>Hey, guys! How are things in Fargo?</i>

1243
01:12:35,438 --> 01:12:36,905
<i>We're from Bismarck.</i>

1244
01:12:39,476 --> 01:12:40,568
North....

1245
01:12:42,078 --> 01:12:43,045
Jesus Christ!

1246
01:12:43,146 --> 01:12:47,310
If the governors from the other states
are sending in their National Guards....

1247
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:50,511
<i>News Net has just learned that America</i>
<i>is on the brink of civil war.</i>

1248
01:12:51,688 --> 01:12:54,851
<i>It is no longer just Idaho</i>
<i>against the federal government.</i>

1249
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:57,927
<i>Our producer Vince Franco</i>
<i>has just sent these images...</i>

1250
01:12:58,028 --> 01:13:00,223
<i>of troops from Montana, North Dakota...</i>

1251
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:03,265
<i>and possibly other states</i>
<i>that are prepared to fight.</i>

1252
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,844
<i>Sometimes the choice</i>
<i>between war and peace...</i>

1253
01:13:20,116 --> 01:13:22,209
<i>between survival and destruction...</i>

1254
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:25,584
<i>can hang on a gesture, a word,</i>
<i>an inflection.</i>

1255
01:13:26,256 --> 01:13:29,020
<i>After any major crisis,</i>
<i>you could always look back...</i>

1256
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:31,355
<i>and find that one moment</i>
<i>that changed it all.</i>

1257
01:13:31,461 --> 01:13:34,396
<i>That instant,</i>
<i>when a line is drawn in the sand...</i>

1258
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:36,328
<i>and there's no turning back.</i>

1259
01:13:46,843 --> 01:13:50,074
Your actions
are unconstitutional and illegal.

1260
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:53,277
I'm ordering you to remove this roadblock.

1261
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:57,213
You posing for the cameras again, Chuck?

1262
01:13:58,088 --> 01:14:00,113
My orders come from the President.

1263
01:14:00,223 --> 01:14:04,592
What I got to do is ensure these children
are admitted into the state of Idaho.

1264
01:14:04,761 --> 01:14:07,889
Well, I have orders
from the Governor of Idaho...

1265
01:14:07,998 --> 01:14:10,200
to see that, that does not happen.

1266
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:10,359
to see that, that does not happen.

1267
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:14,564
Well, you know,
there won't be no second chance.

1268
01:14:14,704 --> 01:14:16,433
Wrong again, Chuck.

1269
01:14:17,007 --> 01:14:19,999
This is your second chance to be first...

1270
01:14:20,977 --> 01:14:22,842
into Kuwait.

1271
01:14:26,649 --> 01:14:28,310
I dare you.

1272
01:14:33,923 --> 01:14:36,653
Turn the little ragheads around.

1273
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:40,460
By the way...

1274
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:44,761
you still owe me a case of whiskey
from that card game in Sarajevo...

1275
01:14:44,968 --> 01:14:47,095
you cheap son of a bitch.

1276
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:55,302
What's going on?

1277
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:58,907
Retreating is not an option!

1278
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:02,544
Fuck this fascist shit! No!

1279
01:15:05,822 --> 01:15:09,314
Twenty hours to go, people.
Eleven states supporting Farley...

1280
01:15:09,692 --> 01:15:11,057
and counting.

1281
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:15,391
Mel, the difference is that this one here
has these three little exclamation marks.

1282
01:15:15,498 --> 01:15:17,261
Yeah, no exclamation marks.

1283
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,725
I could just sort of have them fade off--

1284
01:15:19,836 --> 01:15:23,397
Look here, the country is falling apart,
we don't need exclamation marks.

1285
01:15:23,506 --> 01:15:26,805
Mel, I got an even better idea.
A telethon, like a Jerry Lewis thing...

1286
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:28,537
only with orphans and all that stuff.

1287
01:15:28,645 --> 01:15:29,703
Is this a work in progress?

1288
01:15:29,813 --> 01:15:32,509
It's your own rule.
The three "T's" of great news...

1289
01:15:32,615 --> 01:15:34,276
tits, tots and tears.

1290
01:15:34,384 --> 01:15:36,215
We've got two "T's" right off the bat...

1291
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,914
then we get Helena to dress up
in one of those push-up things....

1292
01:15:40,023 --> 01:15:43,015
-It's a classic idea, Matthew.
-Then we got the three "T's."

1293
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:45,560
-Twenty hours left, Mel.
-Okay. What's with Christina?

1294
01:15:45,662 --> 01:15:47,789
Nobody's going home tonight,
we're ordering in.

1295
01:15:47,897 --> 01:15:49,956
I swear she's having an affair with Farley.

1296
01:15:50,066 --> 01:15:52,557
God, I hope so.
We can get some mileage out of it.

1297
01:15:52,669 --> 01:15:56,366
Don't be ridiculous. This is a news outfit,
not a gossip column.

1298
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:58,771
Don't get pious with me, Alan...

1299
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,866
we're talking about what makes people--

1300
01:16:00,977 --> 01:16:03,673
If Christina is fucking
the Governor of Idaho...

1301
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:05,611
it's nobody's business but Christina's.

1302
01:16:05,715 --> 01:16:07,410
Alan, what did you say?

1303
01:16:08,618 --> 01:16:10,017
Christina is what?

1304
01:16:11,454 --> 01:16:14,116
Christina's fucking the Governor of Idaho?

1305
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:16,988
-I know where you're going with this.
-I do not believe this!

1306
01:16:17,093 --> 01:16:19,960
You're not gonna turn that lunatic
into a human interest story.

1307
01:16:20,063 --> 01:16:21,325
It's Christina.

1308
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:25,698
Hello, Christina.

1309
01:16:26,603 --> 01:16:29,936
Yeah. No, you look a little pale.
What's the matter?

1310
01:16:31,074 --> 01:16:34,043
No, Christina,
I do not need you on the Mexican border.

1311
01:16:34,144 --> 01:16:36,476
I need you where you are, in Idaho.

1312
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:38,505
And, by the way...

1313
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:42,346
I can't commend you enough
on the job you're doing with the Governor.

1314
01:16:44,254 --> 01:16:45,721
Let's go get a smoke.

1315
01:16:45,822 --> 01:16:48,655
Who are these guys?
They weren't here an hour ago.

1316
01:16:48,758 --> 01:16:51,022
I got a battalion of Chinese out here.

1317
01:16:51,728 --> 01:16:53,059
Hundreds of them.

1318
01:16:54,497 --> 01:16:55,828
What Chinese?

1319
01:16:55,932 --> 01:16:59,493
If that's Vinnie, I don't care
if he's got the ghost of Chairman Mao...

1320
01:16:59,602 --> 01:17:01,035
no overtime.

1321
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:02,963
Have a nice day, Sandy.

1322
01:17:05,341 --> 01:17:07,809
Excuse me, who are you?
Where are you from?

1323
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,075
<i>The Colonel says to tell you that we</i>
<i>are the Rhode Island National Guard.</i>

1324
01:17:14,184 --> 01:17:17,745
<i>We are American citizens</i>
<i>who will do our duty in this conflict.</i>

1325
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:33,364
The Governor of Rhode Island's
on News Net.

1326
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:38,566
<i>Our actions in support of Gov. Farley</i>
<i>have been taken...</i>

1327
01:17:38,942 --> 01:17:43,140
<i>because of boatloads and planes</i>
<i>full of refugees from mainland China...</i>

1328
01:17:43,246 --> 01:17:45,612
<i>who continue to descend on Rhode Island.</i>

1329
01:17:46,182 --> 01:17:50,084
<i>It is becoming increasingly difficult</i>
<i>to cope and to govern.</i>

1330
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:55,388
<i>We, therefore, are supporting the position</i>
<i>taken by Idaho in closing its borders...</i>

1331
01:17:55,825 --> 01:18:00,592
<i>and declaring that we too, have the right</i>
<i>to close our borders as we see fit.</i>

1332
01:18:01,097 --> 01:18:04,624
-You know what they say, Jimmy?
-No, what do they say, sir?

1333
01:18:05,268 --> 01:18:09,102
Character is destiny.
We all have our destinies.

1334
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,634
And I have mine.

1335
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:19,981
How soon are we going?
It's gotta get there by tonight, okay?

1336
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:21,345
Oh, God!

1337
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:23,976
-Christina.
-What are you doing here?

1338
01:18:24,087 --> 01:18:26,783
-I need to talk to you.
-There is nothing to talk about.

1339
01:18:26,889 --> 01:18:28,379
-Yes, there is.
-What?

1340
01:18:29,859 --> 01:18:33,295
I want to know what it would take
to make you change your mind.

1341
01:18:33,396 --> 01:18:35,990
-You couldn't begin--
-Try me.

1342
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,232
Anything. Just name it.

1343
01:18:44,941 --> 01:18:47,034
I want the man I fell in love with.

1344
01:18:48,011 --> 01:18:51,276
Terrific. I do just what you advise.

1345
01:18:51,714 --> 01:18:55,480
Dot every ethnic "I"
and cross every racial "T"...

1346
01:18:55,852 --> 01:18:58,548
and what do we get?
The goddamn Chinese...

1347
01:18:58,688 --> 01:19:02,647
our goddamn Chinese,
side with that prick Farley and his rednecks.

1348
01:19:03,026 --> 01:19:04,755
Is this what it's all about?

1349
01:19:04,861 --> 01:19:07,352
Sitting at the bottom
of the goddamn melting pot...

1350
01:19:07,463 --> 01:19:10,796
when it's all boiled away
and there's nothing left but lumps?

1351
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:14,866
Well, you can always renege
on that deal with Kenya Nkomo...

1352
01:19:15,371 --> 01:19:16,929
and that Nation of Islam group.

1353
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,804
How many Electoral College votes
do they control?

1354
01:19:20,977 --> 01:19:23,571
Oh, 60, 70 on a good day.

1355
01:19:24,013 --> 01:19:26,004
How about the Koreans?

1356
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:28,641
I don't know, 26?

1357
01:19:29,452 --> 01:19:32,182
-There's your answer.
-Not necessarily.

1358
01:19:32,522 --> 01:19:35,047
We could let in a million more Koreans...

1359
01:19:35,591 --> 01:19:39,220
jack up the electoral votes to 80, and bingo!

1360
01:19:39,329 --> 01:19:42,423
You've got them eating chop suey
right out of your hand.

1361
01:19:43,766 --> 01:19:45,256
-Mr. President.
-What?

1362
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:47,733
They've blown up the Statue of Liberty.

1363
01:19:49,038 --> 01:19:53,975
<i>At the height of the Reagan era, it was this,</i>
<i>a gala event that thrilled America...</i>

1364
01:19:54,143 --> 01:19:57,442
<i>when the refurbished Statue of Liberty</i>
<i>was unveiled.</i>

1365
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,280
<i>Tonight, it is this:</i>

1366
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:02,283
<i>A shattered mass of steel and dreams.</i>

1367
01:20:03,986 --> 01:20:07,979
<i>A group calling itself Patriots for Farley</i>
<i>has claimed responsibility...</i>

1368
01:20:08,091 --> 01:20:10,616
<i>in a message phoned in to News Net</i>
<i>that reads:</i>

1369
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:13,890
<i>"We will no longer take in</i>
<i>the huddled masses of the world... "

1370
01:20:13,996 --> 01:20:15,861
I need to know that I can trust you.

1371
01:20:15,965 --> 01:20:18,058
<i>"...no more corrupt political compromises. "

1372
01:20:18,167 --> 01:20:21,364
<i>The message ends with,</i>
<i>"Remember the Alamo. "

1373
01:20:21,471 --> 01:20:22,904
-Say Farley.
-"Farley."

1374
01:20:23,005 --> 01:20:26,338
<i>Security around America's</i>
<i>most revered historic sites...</i>

1375
01:20:26,442 --> 01:20:28,376
<i>such as the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia...</i>

1376
01:20:28,478 --> 01:20:30,946
<i>has been heightened</i>
<i>in the wake of the destruction....</i>

1377
01:20:31,047 --> 01:20:34,107
Turn that thing off.
Everybody, get back to their tents.

1378
01:20:34,217 --> 01:20:37,448
-I don't think so, Major.
-I don't think I heard you right.

1379
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:42,383
<i>You heard me, Major.</i>
<i>My sister lives in Idaho.</i>

1380
01:20:42,492 --> 01:20:46,428
<i>I didn't get into this army to fight</i>
<i>other Americans, especially for this bullshit.</i>

1381
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:47,826
<i>At ease, Sergeant.</i>

1382
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:49,454
<i>Fuck you, sir!</i>

1383
01:20:50,166 --> 01:20:52,930
<i>No cameras. I said no cameras!</i>

1384
01:20:53,803 --> 01:20:55,293
<i>Put it down, asshole.</i>

1385
01:20:58,574 --> 01:21:00,872
<i>He shot the Major! Oh, my God!</i>

1386
01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:05,603
<i>My God, they have shot the officer.</i>
<i>Killed the officer in charge.</i>

1387
01:21:05,715 --> 01:21:06,582
<i>-They're shooting others.</i>
<i>-Get that camera.</i>

1388
01:21:06,582 --> 01:21:08,174
<i>-They're shooting others.</i>
<i>-Get that camera.</i>

1389
01:21:09,786 --> 01:21:11,515
They killed their own officer.

1390
01:21:11,621 --> 01:21:14,715
So, what do you expect?
You can only push people so far.

1391
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,524
What the fuck you talking....

1392
01:21:17,627 --> 01:21:21,154
-What, are you trying to justify murder?
-No. You know, fuck you!

1393
01:21:22,899 --> 01:21:23,866
Mutiny?

1394
01:21:24,834 --> 01:21:27,894
This is the Army! The US Army!

1395
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,007
Shit!

1396
01:21:35,678 --> 01:21:37,976
Y'all obey orders now, you hear me?

1397
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:40,178
Oh, God damn.

1398
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:43,212
-I think we should get out of here.
-Not yet.

1399
01:21:45,154 --> 01:21:46,416
-Now.
-Yeah.

1400
01:21:48,558 --> 01:21:52,187
-You know Alan, you have no option--
-You and the other apologists--

1401
01:21:52,295 --> 01:21:53,728
-Shut up!
-Bullshit.

1402
01:21:54,063 --> 01:21:56,497
What are you getting unraveled for now?

1403
01:21:58,868 --> 01:22:00,859
We're inside, not outside.

1404
01:22:01,537 --> 01:22:06,474
Mel, you just don't get it, do you?
It's all outside now. Just get used to it.

1405
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:09,645
There's desertions all over the place.

1406
01:22:09,645 --> 01:22:11,135
There's desertions all over the place.

1407
01:22:11,247 --> 01:22:14,410
Tell Buford to get some movement,
anything to pull it all together.

1408
01:22:14,517 --> 01:22:17,042
-Move some armored brigades out.
-We can't.

1409
01:22:17,286 --> 01:22:19,049
What do you mean, we can't?

1410
01:22:19,188 --> 01:22:22,248
Most of the tanks need spare parts
for the turbine compressors.

1411
01:22:22,358 --> 01:22:25,850
So what am I, a repair shop foreman?
Get the goddamn parts, fix them.

1412
01:22:25,962 --> 01:22:29,261
-We can't.
-What are you telling me?

1413
01:22:29,832 --> 01:22:31,163
Hold on a minute.

1414
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:36,028
Mr. President, after the free trade talks
you signed with Taiwan...

1415
01:22:36,205 --> 01:22:39,834
we stopped making spare parts
because they could make them cheaper.

1416
01:22:40,376 --> 01:22:45,211
And then you got into that argument....
That dialogue with him...

1417
01:22:45,448 --> 01:22:48,144
and they stopped shipping us
any military parts.

1418
01:22:48,618 --> 01:22:51,382
Let's look on the bright side, shall we?
I mean...

1419
01:22:52,021 --> 01:22:54,615
after all, the glass is really half full.

1420
01:22:55,024 --> 01:22:57,993
I mean,
about those 70 Electoral College votes...

1421
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,789
we don't really need the Nation of Islam,
the Chinese...

1422
01:23:01,898 --> 01:23:04,162
the Koreans, or hell, anybody.

1423
01:23:04,267 --> 01:23:07,794
What we do
is take the Irish off birth control.

1424
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,930
They will breed like rabbits, I know,
they're my people.

1425
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,067
They fuck like drunken minks,
we'll be up to 80 votes in no time at all.

1426
01:23:15,177 --> 01:23:16,735
By God!

1427
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:24,581
Line them up.

1428
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:31,753
<i>We're being ordered out of the area now.</i>
<i>The military has ordered us away.</i>

1429
01:23:31,861 --> 01:23:35,353
<i>They're setting up a firing squad over here.</i>
<i>This has not happened before.</i>

1430
01:23:35,464 --> 01:23:37,455
<i>They're going to execute three--</i>

1431
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,927
-Turn that camera off.
-What are you doing?

1432
01:23:40,036 --> 01:23:43,233
-Get the hell out of here.
-You aren't really gonna shoot these guys?

1433
01:23:43,339 --> 01:23:45,398
What is this guy? Get this guy out of here.

1434
01:23:45,508 --> 01:23:48,341
Are you gonna shoot these guys?
Now you're gonna shoot me?

1435
01:23:48,444 --> 01:23:49,843
You're not gonna shoot me.

1436
01:23:49,946 --> 01:23:52,710
<i>You can't shoot me.</i>
<i>We're on national television here, okay?</i>

1437
01:23:52,815 --> 01:23:54,043
<i>Come on--</i>

1438
01:23:56,752 --> 01:23:58,083
Get out of here.

1439
01:24:02,391 --> 01:24:03,585
<i>Go ahead!</i>

1440
01:24:03,759 --> 01:24:07,627
<i>Kill your own! Kill America!</i>
<i>There's nothing left of it anyway.</i>

1441
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:10,597
<i>Just a bunch of politicians or executives...</i>

1442
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,998
<i>who hire people in places we don't live.</i>

1443
01:24:13,102 --> 01:24:14,626
<i>Are you gonna kill for that?</i>

1444
01:24:14,737 --> 01:24:15,761
Squad, ready.

1445
01:24:15,871 --> 01:24:18,431
-Go ahead, you bastards.
-Aim.

1446
01:24:20,276 --> 01:24:21,368
<i>Fire.</i>

1447
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:24,376
They shot them!

1448
01:24:25,381 --> 01:24:28,782
-Oh, shit! What is this?
-Please, we're on the air.

1449
01:24:28,985 --> 01:24:32,284
-In other news--
-Fuck this....

1450
01:24:32,555 --> 01:24:35,581
-We're killing our own people.
-We're on the air.

1451
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:40,619
In other news, the White house has said
that they will be making a statement--

1452
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:43,096
<i>Fuck you, Matthew, there is no other news.</i>

1453
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:46,498
<i>-About this particular situation.</i>
-Get her off.

1454
01:24:46,636 --> 01:24:48,866
Our News Net correspondents are there.

1455
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:52,406
We will bring you this when we hear it.

1456
01:24:53,009 --> 01:24:57,742
<i>We have, I believe, four correspondents...</i>

1457
01:24:58,481 --> 01:25:03,282
<i>-at the White House, as soon as--</i>
<i>-There is no other news.</i>

1458
01:25:03,419 --> 01:25:05,512
<i>-As soon as we are able--</i>
<i>-Shut up!</i>

1459
01:25:05,755 --> 01:25:08,451
<i>-Most of--</i>
<i>-Shut up, you little wanker.</i>

1460
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:11,251
<i>Don't you get it, there is no other news?</i>

1461
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,419
<i>And, hopefully we will be--</i>

1462
01:25:14,997 --> 01:25:15,964
<i>Shut up!</i>

1463
01:25:56,038 --> 01:25:58,268
This has to be your decision.

1464
01:25:59,108 --> 01:26:01,201
It was made a long time ago.

1465
01:26:01,677 --> 01:26:04,043
I just don't want you to feel that you--

1466
01:26:13,689 --> 01:26:17,181
Jimmy, I'm gonna want to make a statement
to the press in the morning...

1467
01:26:17,293 --> 01:26:19,386
about an hour before the deadline.

1468
01:26:24,366 --> 01:26:26,527
Mr. Buchan.

1469
01:26:27,837 --> 01:26:31,637
Mr. Buchan, I have some information
you might want to know about.

1470
01:26:39,648 --> 01:26:40,876
Mr. President.

1471
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:49,418
Secession!

1472
01:26:50,493 --> 01:26:54,793
He's going to announce, one hour before
the deadline, that Idaho's going to secede...

1473
01:26:54,897 --> 01:26:58,128
and start a whole new country,
like the South did in the Civil War?

1474
01:26:58,234 --> 01:27:00,293
Well, that's what
this News Net guy said, yeah.

1475
01:27:00,402 --> 01:27:01,767
How the hell does he know?

1476
01:27:01,871 --> 01:27:04,772
Well, I'm not supposed to know this,
but it seems that...

1477
01:27:04,874 --> 01:27:07,809
one of their reporters is shacking up
with Farley.

1478
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:09,901
That son of a bitch.

1479
01:27:10,012 --> 01:27:13,345
-He's waging a public relations war.
-You're damn right.

1480
01:27:13,582 --> 01:27:17,985
If I know anything, I know PR.
And that is what runs this country.

1481
01:27:18,187 --> 01:27:20,519
-lf Eisenhower were here--
-Forget Eisenhower.

1482
01:27:20,623 --> 01:27:23,990
Yeah, but don't forget,
you're on the line for those orphans.

1483
01:27:24,093 --> 01:27:25,754
Screw the orphans.

1484
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:31,231
We went out on a limb for them.
What did they get us in return?

1485
01:27:31,834 --> 01:27:35,429
Every damn ethnic group in the country
crying the blues.

1486
01:27:36,806 --> 01:27:40,503
This isn't a time for Eisenhower.
It's a time for Lincoln.

1487
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:45,440
Lincoln took the bull by the horns
when the South tried to secede, gentlemen.

1488
01:27:46,282 --> 01:27:50,412
If Lincoln was here, you think he'd let
a bunch of orphans decide everything?

1489
01:27:50,953 --> 01:27:52,853
I've said it all along.

1490
01:27:53,689 --> 01:27:54,656
Action!

1491
01:28:25,054 --> 01:28:26,646
Jesus Christ! What now?

1492
01:28:28,924 --> 01:28:30,892
Oh, what the hell....

1493
01:28:31,293 --> 01:28:32,988
Nobody lives forever.

1494
01:28:33,863 --> 01:28:35,228
Let's get a story.

1495
01:28:36,999 --> 01:28:38,660
This one's for the Duke.

1496
01:28:46,508 --> 01:28:50,069
<i>This is Blaine Gorman reporting</i>
<i>from just inside the Idaho border.</i>

1497
01:28:51,247 --> 01:28:53,909
<i>The federal troops have attacked.</i>
<i>There is war!</i>

1498
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:57,452
<i>The Second Civil War has just broken out,</i>
<i>two hours before the deadline.</i>

1499
01:28:57,553 --> 01:28:58,986
<i>All around me are--</i>

1500
01:29:00,556 --> 01:29:01,523
<i>Blaine!</i>

1501
01:29:05,728 --> 01:29:07,127
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

1502
01:29:09,465 --> 01:29:12,229
<i>It's too late, Eddie. Come on.</i>

1503
01:29:18,641 --> 01:29:22,634
I'm trying to remember the words
to the Pledge of Allegiance.

1504
01:29:26,348 --> 01:29:28,782
Said it a million times when I was a kid.

1505
01:29:31,754 --> 01:29:33,244
Right now, I...

1506
01:29:39,795 --> 01:29:42,161
can't seem to remember the words.

1507
01:29:45,868 --> 01:29:46,835
Jack!

1508
01:29:50,105 --> 01:29:52,699
What in God's name is this?

1509
01:29:52,841 --> 01:29:56,140
-Action, not reaction.
-Why? Farley was gonna quit.

1510
01:29:59,782 --> 01:30:02,307
What are you talking about?
You told me yourself...

1511
01:30:02,418 --> 01:30:05,353
we had to take action before Farley
made his secession speech.

1512
01:30:05,454 --> 01:30:08,617
I said succession...

1513
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:10,849
not secession!

1514
01:30:12,194 --> 01:30:14,219
He was going to step down.

1515
01:30:14,797 --> 01:30:17,857
He was going to announce
that he's going to hold a convention...

1516
01:30:17,967 --> 01:30:21,528
to choose someone to succeed him,
for Christ's sake.

1517
01:30:21,971 --> 01:30:23,495
What're you yelling for?

1518
01:30:23,605 --> 01:30:28,542
He's going to marry Christina Fernandez
and raise Mexican babies.

1519
01:30:34,049 --> 01:30:38,179
Well, the President's in his Lincoln mode
right now...

1520
01:30:38,354 --> 01:30:41,687
and I think this will
just confuse the shit out of him, so...

1521
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:44,054
I think we had just better...

1522
01:30:45,194 --> 01:30:46,661
play this one out.

1523
01:31:44,053 --> 01:31:47,147
Alan, why isn't our logo on that shot?

1524
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,293
I promised my wife...

1525
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,059
I'd be home to make breakfast.

1526
01:32:12,548 --> 01:32:14,880
<i>I read years ago that someone once said...</i>

1527
01:32:14,983 --> 01:32:18,419
<i>that those whom the Gods destroy,</i>
<i>they first make mad.</i>

1528
01:32:19,021 --> 01:32:22,457
<i>Or maybe it's just</i>
<i>that we're an unfinished piece of art.</i>

1529
01:32:23,058 --> 01:32:27,791
<i>Part tragedy, part comedy, part joy,</i>
<i>part farce, a work in progress.</i>

1530
01:32:28,363 --> 01:32:32,493
<i>But, for the moment, we're still painting</i>
<i>and writing in blood.</i>

1531
01:32:33,168 --> 01:32:36,160
<i>And it always seems</i>
<i>to come out of a lot of suffering.</i>

1532
01:32:36,505 --> 01:32:41,204
<i>Someday, after it all dries,</i>
<i>it will be magnificent.</i>

1533
01:32:41,643 --> 01:32:45,943
<i>But until then, like all art,</i>
<i>it's messy as hell.</i>

1534
01:32:59,761 --> 01:33:02,958
<i>...order has been restored</i>
<i>throughout the country...</i>

1535
01:33:03,065 --> 01:33:06,466
<i>and with the cessation</i>
<i>of all military activities now a week old...</i>

1536
01:33:06,568 --> 01:33:09,162
<i>the former President appealed for calm.</i>

1537
01:33:09,538 --> 01:33:12,473
<i>And, in other news,</i>
<i>the delayed broadcast last night...</i>

1538
01:33:12,574 --> 01:33:15,407
<i>of Susan Lucci's final episode of</i>
All My Children...

1539
01:33:15,511 --> 01:33:18,139
<i>in which Erica finally runs off</i>
<i>with Antonio...</i>

1540
01:33:18,247 --> 01:33:21,410
<i>became the most watched</i>
<i>television program in history...</i>

1541
01:33:21,517 --> 01:33:24,611
<i>outdoing even the final episode of</i> M.A.S.H.
