1
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:05,709
<i>We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.</i>

2
00:00:05,983 --> 00:00:08,748
<i>Aliens are dead, sliced open...</i>

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,491
<i>Requesting aid from any
vessel within range...</i>

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:21,470
<i>Our crew is made of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.</i>

5
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:25,472
<i>This is not a war craft, I
repeat, this is not a war craft.</i>

6
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:41,753
Hear me... and rejoice.

7
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:47,541
You have had the privilege

8
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:50,620
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

9
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:55,867
You may think this is suffering.

10
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:58,272
No.

11
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:01,025
It is salvation.

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,133
Universal scales

13
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,920
tipped toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

14
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:13,762
Smile

15
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:16,606
for even in death

16
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:19,843
you have become
Children of Thanos.

17
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,749
I know what it's like to lose.

18
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:42,701
To feel so desperately
that you're right,

19
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,349
yet to fail nonetheless.

20
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:55,476
As lightning

21
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,694
turns the legs to jelly.

22
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,825
I ask you
to what end?

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,661
Dread it, run from it...

24
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:10,485
Destiny arrives all the same.

25
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,514
And now, it's here.

26
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:15,790
Or should I say...

27
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,821
I am.

28
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,154
You talk too much.

29
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,326
The Tesseract.

30
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:31,013
Or, your brother's head.

31
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:37,668
I assume you have a preference?

32
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:40,433
Oh, I do.

33
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,190
Kill away.

34
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,685
All right, stop!

35
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:08,012
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.

36
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:22,192
You really are the worst, brother.

37
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:30,724
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.

38
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,607
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.

39
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:39,918
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

40
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:41,430
And for another...

41
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:44,962
we have a Hulk.

42
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:58,740
Let him have his fun.

43
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,387
Forefathers...

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,811
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.

45
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,870
That was a mistake.

46
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,561
No!

47
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:35,150
You are going to die for that!

48
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:48,469
My humble personage...

49
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:53,110
bows before your grandeur.

50
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:58,049
No other being, has
ever had the might,

51
00:05:58,423 --> 00:06:00,118
nay, the nobility,

52
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:05,758
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

53
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:10,350
The Universe,

54
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,666
lies within your grasp.

55
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:56,020
There are two more
Stones on Earth.

56
00:06:56,543 --> 00:07:00,315
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.

57
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:04,542
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...

58
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,027
If you're going to Earth,

59
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:08,652
you might want a guide.

60
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:11,372
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

61
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:13,856
If you consider failure experience.

62
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:16,559
I consider experience, experience.

63
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:19,527
Almighty Thanos.

64
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:24,794
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...

65
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,387
Odin-son...

66
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:35,638
The rightful king of Jotunheim,

67
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:38,426
God of Mischief...

68
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:40,724
Do hereby pledge to you,

69
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:45,284
my undying fidelity.

70
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:58,064
"Undying"?

71
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:04,431
You should choose your
words more carefully.

72
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:26,329
You...

73
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,024
will never be...

74
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:33,149
a god.

75
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:02,136
No resurrections this time.

76
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,694
No... Loki...

77
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:09,125
Seriously? You don't
have any money?

78
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,454
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

79
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,838
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

80
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:16,439
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical Ham and Rye.

81
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,976
- Wait, wait. I think I got a 200.
- Dollars?

82
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:20,947
- Rupees.
- Which is?

83
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:26,816
I wouldn't say no
to a Tuna Melt.

84
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:40,768
Thanos is coming.

85
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,947
We've got to...

86
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:48,164
Who?

87
00:10:57,469 --> 00:10:59,172
Slow down. I'm
totally not kidding.

88
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:00,462
- No, I'm not.
- Your rambling lost me.

89
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:03,531
Look, you know how you're having a
dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

90
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:04,296
Yeah.

91
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:06,563
Okay, then you're like, my
God, there's no bathroom,

92
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:08,017
what am I gonna do? Oh!
Someone's watching!

93
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,012
Right. And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.

94
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,377
- Yes.
- Yeah.

95
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:13,461
Everybody has that.

96
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,865
Right. That's the point
I'm trying to make.

97
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:19,708
Last night, I dreamt,
we had a kid.

98
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,327
So real.

99
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:23,396
We named him after
your eccentric uncle.

100
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:26,396
- What was his name? Porsey. Morgan.
- Right.

101
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:30,304
So you woke up,
and we were...

102
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:31,579
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

103
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:32,494
- Yes?
- No.

104
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,972
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...

105
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:38,040
You wouldn't have done that.

106
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,270
I'm glad you brought this up

107
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,979
cause it's nothing,
just a housing unit for nano-parts.

108
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:44,702
- It's not helping your case. OK?
- It's an attachment. It's not a...

109
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:47,311
- You don't need that.
- I know. I had the surgery.

110
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:50,384
I'm just trying to protect us.
The future, as is, and that's it.

111
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,096
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Just letting you know.

112
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:54,714
Shirts.

113
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,533
You know me so well.

114
00:11:57,932 --> 00:11:59,787
You finish all my sentences.

115
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:02,908
You should have shirts
in your closet.

116
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,707
Yeah. You know what
there should be?

117
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:08,646
No more surprises. We'll
have a nice dinner tonight.

118
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,928
We should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.

119
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:15,609
- Yeah.
- I will.

120
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:21,487
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.

121
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,069
I need you to come with me.

122
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,834
Oh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.

123
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:29,917
I'm sorry. You giving
out tickets or something?

124
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:31,243
We need your help.

125
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:35,287
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.

126
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,842
And who's "we"?

127
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:41,311
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!

128
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:47,654
You okay?

129
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,797
From the dawn of the Universe,

130
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,653
there was nothing.
Then, boom!

131
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:58,723
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,

132
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:01,876
hurdling across the virgin Universe.

133
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:04,272
These Infinity Stones

134
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:07,265
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

135
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,766
Space.

136
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:12,305
Reality.

137
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,929
Power.

138
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:17,132
Soul.

139
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:19,750
Mind.

140
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,156
And Time.

141
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:34,661
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.

142
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:38,115
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

143
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,021
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.

144
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,451
The attack on New York. That's him.

145
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,455
- What's our time line?
- No telling.

146
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,130
He has the Power and Space Stones,

147
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,806
that only makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.

148
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:57,730
If he gets his hands, on
all six Stones, Tony...

149
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:01,636
He can destroy life on a scale
of hitherto hundredth of.

150
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,512
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto hundredth of"?

151
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:05,869
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

152
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:06,980
Is that what that is?

153
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:11,927
I'm going to allow that.

154
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,150
If Thanos needs all six,

155
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,283
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?

156
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:18,418
No can do.

157
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,495
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

158
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,870
And I swore off dairy, but Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

159
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,658
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.

160
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:27,934
A bit chalky.

161
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,933
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.

162
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:32,620
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

163
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:35,301
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.

164
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,516
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

165
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:40,575
And still conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!

166
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,245
Only if we don't do our jobs.

167
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,395
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?

168
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,523
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.

169
00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:51,688
Okay guys, can we quick cable
this discussion right now?

170
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:55,087
The fact is we have the stone.
We know where it is.

171
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,572
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.

172
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,604
And we have to find him now.

173
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,697
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?

174
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:06,158
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

175
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,346
What?

176
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,142
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

177
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,065
- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?

178
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,890
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.

179
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:23,687
Maybe. But...

180
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,852
Call him.

181
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:30,812
It's not that easy.

182
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:33,729
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?

183
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:36,743
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

184
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:38,484
Broke up?

185
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:44,250
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.

186
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,078
We're not on speaking terms.

187
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,375
Tony, listen to me.

188
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,406
Thor's gone.

189
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:57,961
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

190
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:39,675
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?

191
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:42,190
Not at the moment, no.

192
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,784
You okay?

193
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,277
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.

194
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:23,309
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.

195
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,755
You better not put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

196
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,677
I might wanna use it.

197
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:57,897
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

198
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,217
Holy shit!

199
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,747
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!

200
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:13,650
What's the matter with you kids?

201
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:16,199
You never seen a spaceship before?

202
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:31,701
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street, notify first responders.

203
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:32,881
Will do.

204
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:04,372
Hear me, and rejoice!

205
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:09,529
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

206
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:14,450
Be thankful, that your meaningless
lives are now contributing to...

207
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:17,497
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

208
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:20,344
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

209
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:21,856
Stone keeper...

210
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:24,569
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?

211
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:26,525
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

212
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:30,054
There's no trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

213
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:33,672
- You need to get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.

214
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,546
Bring me the Stone.

215
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,937
Hey, do you want a piece?

216
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,218
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.

217
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,936
Been a while. Good
to have you, buddy.

218
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:52,787
I just... I need to
concentrate for a second.

219
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,770
Come on, come on, Max.

220
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,649
Where's your guy?

221
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,892
I don't know. We're
certainly having a thing.

222
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:05,542
There's no time for a thing. That's
the thing right there. Let's go.

223
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:14,340
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

224
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:16,840
- I can't... He won't...
- It's okay. Stand down.

225
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:19,107
- Can I leave you with him? Thank you.
- I have him.

226
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:52,169
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech. You like it? A little...

227
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:58,511
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...

228
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,868
- You gotta get that stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.

229
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,525
Exactly. Bye!

230
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:24,292
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?

231
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,498
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

232
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:28,511
I'm trying. He won't come out.

233
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:41,050
Come on, Hulk. What
are you doing?

234
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,495
Come on. Come on! Come on!

235
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,963
No!

236
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:52,440
What do you mean, "no"?

237
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:00,323
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?

238
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:02,542
The field trip.

239
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:06,232
What is this guy's problem, Mr.
Stark?

240
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:09,858
He's from space, came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.

241
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:40,703
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.

242
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:45,209
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

243
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:47,432
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

244
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:05,248
You wouldn't. Removing a dead
man's spell... Troublesome.

245
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:07,646
You'll only wish you were dead.

246
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,687
No!

247
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:24,655
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!

248
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:35,157
Not cool.

249
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:54,181
- Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.

250
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:16,134
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

251
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,895
Give me a little juice, Friday.

252
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:34,990
Unlock 17-A.

253
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:49,847
Kid, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

254
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,699
But you said save the wizard!

255
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:53,520
I can't breathe!

256
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,285
You're too high up. You're
running out of air.

257
00:24:57,449 --> 00:24:59,706
That makes sense.

258
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,090
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.

259
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:21,388
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.

260
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,005
Oh, come on!

261
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,225
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

262
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:35,751
Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?

263
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:38,782
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.

264
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:39,901
Why?

265
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,258
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for awhile.

266
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:46,063
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.

267
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:48,413
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.

268
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:49,845
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

269
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:51,308
I don't know how to say this. Pep...

270
00:25:51,408 --> 00:25:53,236
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Come back here right now!

271
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,524
Come back!

272
00:25:55,525 --> 00:26:00,071
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...

273
00:26:08,564 --> 00:26:10,845
Oh, my God.

274
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:17,057
I should have stayed on the bus.

275
00:26:30,543 --> 00:26:33,972
- Where you going?
- Time Stone's been taken.

276
00:26:33,997 --> 00:26:36,287
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

277
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:37,785
What will you do?

278
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:41,398
I'm gonna make a call.

279
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:22,564
Sing it, Drax!

280
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:35,930
Why are we doing this again?

281
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:38,650
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

282
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:42,658
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.

283
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:45,606
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...

284
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,221
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...

285
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:51,381
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.

286
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:55,355
- Exactly! Alright!
- B-b-b-bingo!

287
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:59,534
We are arriving.

288
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,025
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might

289
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:04,463
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

290
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:13,058
Groot, put that thing away. Now.
I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.

291
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,738
I am Groot!

292
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:17,043
- Whoa! Language!
- Wow!

293
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:18,887
You got some acorns on you, kid.

294
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:22,396
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.

295
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:26,131
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!

296
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:35,576
What happened?

297
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:40,619
Oh, my God.

298
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,072
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

299
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:53,126
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.

300
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,504
How the hell is this
dude still alive?

301
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:06,153
He is not a dude. You're a dude.

302
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:09,770
This... This is a man.

303
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:13,466
- Handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.

304
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:16,466
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.

305
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:20,543
- Yeah, right. What?
- It's true. You have little weight...

306
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,504
Gamora, do you think I'm...

307
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:29,608
He is anxious. Angry.

308
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:33,754
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.

309
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:36,936
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

310
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:39,727
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.

311
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:40,997
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.

312
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:43,706
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

313
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:45,362
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?

314
00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:49,250
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fiber.

315
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:51,276
Stop massaging his muscles.

316
00:29:52,564 --> 00:29:54,399
Wake him up.

317
00:29:56,387 --> 00:29:57,630
Wake.

318
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:17,672
Who the hell are you guys?

319
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:23,805
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:

320
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:27,609
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.

321
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:32,688
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.

322
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,771
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

323
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,716
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.

324
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:43,075
You seem to know a
great deal about Thanos.

325
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:46,525
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.

326
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:53,096
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.

327
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:57,761
Stepfather. Technically, she
hates him as much as you do.

328
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:01,716
Thanos can be tough.

329
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:05,637
Look. Before my father died,
he told me I had a half-sister...

330
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:08,789
that he imprisoned in Hell.
Then she returned

331
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:12,450
home, and stabbed me in the eye,
so... I had to kill her.

332
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,453
It's life, there was nothing else.

333
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:20,406
- And I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.

334
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,986
I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

335
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:28,042
My father killed my mother, then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.

336
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:31,006
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.

337
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:34,265
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.

338
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:37,038
I need a hammer, not a spoon...

339
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:38,981
How do I open this thing?

340
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:43,063
Is there some sort of a
four-digit code maybe...

341
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:46,110
- Maybe a birth date or something...
- What are you doing?

342
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:47,358
Taking your pod.

343
00:31:48,854 --> 00:31:50,658
No, you're not!

344
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:56,732
You'll not, be taking
our pod today, sir.

345
00:31:57,264 --> 00:32:00,379
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

346
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:03,328
- No.
- You are.

347
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:06,297
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

348
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:08,632
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!

349
00:32:08,657 --> 00:32:11,611
This is my voice!

350
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:18,896
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?

351
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:20,999
You just did it again.

352
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:23,092
He's trying to copy me.

353
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:26,475
Enough! We need to stop Thanos.

354
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,295
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.

355
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:30,327
Nowhere.

356
00:32:30,508 --> 00:32:35,093
- He must be going somewhere.
- No. Nowhere? It's a place.

357
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,767
We've been there. It sucks.

358
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,625
Excuse me, that's our food.

359
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,930
- Not anymore.
- Thor...

360
00:32:40,955 --> 00:32:43,507
Why would he go to nowhere?

361
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:46,379
Because for years,
reality stone has been safely stored,

362
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:48,650
there with a man
we call the collector.

363
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:50,629
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

364
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,454
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.

365
00:32:52,497 --> 00:32:53,506
Or a genius.

366
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:56,317
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?

367
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,278
There's six stones out there.

368
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:03,138
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,

369
00:33:03,163 --> 00:33:05,082
when he decimated Xandar.

370
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:07,407
He stole the Space Stone from me.

371
00:33:07,422 --> 00:33:10,367
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

372
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:13,376
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

373
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:15,722
- The Avengers?
- They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

374
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:18,724
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.

375
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:19,956
Haven't been there in a while.

376
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,247
As for the Soul Stone,
no one's ever seen that.

377
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:23,752
No one even knows where it is.

378
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:27,330
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Nowhere.

379
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,752
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.

380
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:33,783
- Then we have to go to Nowhere now.
- Wrong.

381
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:37,394
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.

382
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:41,458
- Oh what's made up?
- Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

383
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:44,541
I mean, that place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,

384
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,958
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.

385
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,133
I would very much like
to go there, please.

386
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:51,413
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.

387
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:52,734
Rabbit?

388
00:33:52,757 --> 00:33:55,267
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.

389
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,709
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.

390
00:33:57,734 --> 00:34:00,952
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?

391
00:34:00,977 --> 00:34:04,755
Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

392
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:07,398
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.

393
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:08,954
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.

394
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:11,555
- Quill, sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.

395
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,289
And I'm not going to...

396
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:16,695
Wait, what kind of weapon
are we talking about here?

397
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,711
The Thanos killing kind.

398
00:34:18,736 --> 00:34:20,582
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

399
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:22,777
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.

400
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,337
Your bodies will crumble as you
minds collapse to the madness.

401
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:27,246
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

402
00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:28,381
A little bit. Yeah.

403
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:31,230
If we don't go to Nowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,

404
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:33,800
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.

405
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,611
I got it figured out.

406
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:39,128
We got two ships, and the
largest go with the morons.

407
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,452
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,

408
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:44,797
and the morons will go to
Nowhere to try and stop Thanos.

409
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,391
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

410
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:49,164
For the record...

411
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:51,884
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.

412
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:56,259
You know, you shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.

413
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,469
Come on, Groot.

414
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:01,126
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

415
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:09,027
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.

416
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:24,876
Vis?

417
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,178
Is it the stone again?

418
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:29,461
It's as if it's speaking to me.

419
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,704
What does it say?

420
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:35,642
I don't... I don't know.
Something...

421
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:50,369
Tell me what you feel.

422
00:35:57,482 --> 00:36:00,848
I just feel you.

423
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:10,626
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow

424
00:36:10,826 --> 00:36:12,970
to give us more time together
before you went back.

425
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:15,994
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.

426
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:18,775
What if I missed all the trains?

427
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:21,767
What if this time,
I didn't go back?

428
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:24,417
- You gave Stark your word.
- I'd rather give it to you.

429
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:27,887
There are people who are expecting me
too, you know. We both made promises.

430
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:29,582
Not to each other.

431
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,863
Wanda...

432
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:35,802
Two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work.

433
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:40,388
And... I don't know. You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

434
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:44,905
- I, I... I think... It works.
- It works. It works.

435
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:49,147
Stay.

436
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:59,300
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

437
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:08,338
What are they?

438
00:37:08,448 --> 00:37:11,635
What the stone was
warning me about.

439
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:25,403
- I have to go.
- No. Vision. If that's true...

440
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,513
Then maybe going isn't
the best idea.

441
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:30,693
Wanda, I...

442
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,567
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.

443
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:07,351
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

444
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:16,273
Vis!

445
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:28,983
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.

446
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,676
Hands off.

447
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:28,706
Come on. You gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Come on.

448
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:32,775
We have to go.

449
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:38,103
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.

450
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:41,268
I'm staying.

451
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:53,279
- Get up.
- I can't.

452
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,123
We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.

453
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,248
You'll never get
the chance again.

454
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,908
Can you stand?

455
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:23,493
Thank you, Captain.

456
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:27,204
Let's get you on the jet.

457
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:33,572
I thought
we had a deal.

458
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:37,486
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.

459
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,587
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

460
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:45,869
Where to, Cap?

461
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:49,642
Home.

462
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:54,891
We'll be safe.

463
00:42:19,427 --> 00:42:22,107
- Zen-Whoberians...
- Mother!

464
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:25,420
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!

465
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:31,012
One side, for reservation.
The other, an honor...

466
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:34,362
What's wrong, little one?

467
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:38,355
My mother. Where is my mother?

468
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:44,389
What's your name?

469
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:46,905
Gamora.

470
00:42:47,038 --> 00:42:50,358
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.

471
00:42:50,756 --> 00:42:54,654
Come. Let me help you.

472
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,373
Look.

473
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:15,451
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.

474
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:17,592
As all things should be.

475
00:43:17,624 --> 00:43:22,568
Too much to one side,
or the other...

476
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,790
Here. You try.

477
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,246
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.

478
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,578
Concentrate.

479
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:48,702
There! You've got it.

480
00:43:56,903 --> 00:43:58,590
Gamora.

481
00:43:58,923 --> 00:44:03,059
You know these grenades are the
"blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind?

482
00:44:03,082 --> 00:44:05,761
'Cause I was thinking I might hang
a couple on my belt right here.

483
00:44:05,785 --> 00:44:08,808
- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.

484
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:10,738
Yeah, sure.

485
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:15,585
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.

486
00:44:16,785 --> 00:44:19,511
Which is what the
grenades are for.

487
00:44:19,738 --> 00:44:21,938
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

488
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:26,041
If things go wrong...

489
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,900
If Thanos gets me...

490
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:37,487
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.

491
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:39,276
What?

492
00:44:41,925 --> 00:44:44,893
I know something he doesn't.

493
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:49,065
If he finds it out...

494
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,386
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?

495
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,316
If I tell you, you'd know, too.

496
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:01,024
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?

497
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:02,217
Only if you wanna die.

498
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:05,080
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

499
00:45:05,158 --> 00:45:06,588
Just...

500
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:11,588
trust me. And
possibly, kill me.

501
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,932
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...

502
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,291
Swear to me.

503
00:45:20,861 --> 00:45:23,746
Swear to me on your mother.

504
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:32,167
Okay.

505
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:57,668
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?

506
00:45:57,692 --> 00:46:00,434
- An hour.
- An hour?

507
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:02,152
Are you serious?

508
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:07,973
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...

509
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:12,972
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.

510
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:20,430
- You're eating a zark nut.
- But my movement...

511
00:46:20,556 --> 00:46:22,852
So slow...

512
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,188
- And it's imperceptible.
- No.

513
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:30,157
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.

514
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:34,235
Damn it.

515
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:57,005
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.

516
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,772
- From the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.

517
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,484
Let's put it down over here.

518
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:35,819
I know you have the Reality Stone.

519
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:40,654
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

520
00:47:43,454 --> 00:47:47,664
I told you. I sold it.

521
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:54,832
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.

522
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:59,136
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.

523
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:02,019
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.

524
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:04,183
I didn't know what it was.

525
00:48:04,191 --> 00:48:07,324
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.

526
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:10,386
Last chance, Charlotte.

527
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:13,196
Where's the Stone?

528
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:18,297
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

529
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:19,945
Drax, wait!

530
00:48:20,454 --> 00:48:22,688
Whoa, not yet!

531
00:48:29,343 --> 00:48:32,155
He doesn't have the Stone yet.

532
00:48:32,187 --> 00:48:34,491
We get it, and then
we can stop him.

533
00:48:34,532 --> 00:48:37,375
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.

534
00:48:37,446 --> 00:48:42,805
No. No. For Ovette.
For Camaria.

535
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,719
Sleep.

536
00:48:55,943 --> 00:49:01,161
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.

537
00:49:01,177 --> 00:49:04,481
I'm... The other right!

538
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:30,337
Why?

539
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:43,766
Why you? Daughter...

540
00:50:02,243 --> 00:50:04,430
That was quick.

541
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:14,403
Magnificent! Magnificent!

542
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:19,911
Is it sadness I sense
in you, daughter?

543
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:25,708
In my heart, I knew
you still cared.

544
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:35,093
No one ever knows for sure.

545
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:48,056
Reality is often disappointing.

546
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:53,761
That is, it was.

547
00:50:54,753 --> 00:50:56,339
Now...

548
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,641
Reality can be whatever I want.

549
00:51:02,305 --> 00:51:05,906
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.

550
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:10,160
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

551
00:51:13,948 --> 00:51:15,963
Thanos!

552
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:32,619
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...

553
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,143
- I told you to go right.
- Now...

554
00:51:36,182 --> 00:51:40,674
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.

555
00:51:41,377 --> 00:51:45,595
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long term booty call.

556
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:47,580
- Let her go.
- Peter...

557
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:52,252
Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack
of a chin right off your face!

558
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,572
Not him.

559
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:07,684
You promised!

560
00:52:12,812 --> 00:52:17,241
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.

561
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:23,465
She's asked, hasn't she?

562
00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:27,543
Do it.

563
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,113
Do it!

564
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,316
I told you to go right!

565
00:52:45,012 --> 00:52:48,183
I love you, more than anything.

566
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:53,731
I love you, too.

567
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:08,646
I like you.

568
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,473
Still no word from Vision?

569
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:43,162
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

570
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:47,146
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.

571
00:53:47,162 --> 00:53:48,368
You know they're only criminals

572
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:50,592
because you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

573
00:53:50,617 --> 00:53:55,032
My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.

574
00:53:55,055 --> 00:53:58,499
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

575
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:02,007
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

576
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:03,864
That's right.

577
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:07,264
And I'm pretty sure
I've paid for that.

578
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:10,593
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.

579
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:19,512
Mr. Secretary.

580
00:54:22,185 --> 00:54:25,903
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.

581
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:28,872
You could use some
of that right now.

582
00:54:29,005 --> 00:54:31,903
The world's on fire.

583
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:35,560
And you think, all is forgiven?

584
00:54:35,654 --> 00:54:40,419
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking for permission.

585
00:54:41,537 --> 00:54:46,520
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.

586
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,442
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

587
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:52,185
We'll fight you, too.

588
00:54:55,244 --> 00:54:58,806
- Arrest them.
- All over it.

589
00:55:03,962 --> 00:55:06,172
That's a court-martial.

590
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,634
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.

591
00:55:11,659 --> 00:55:12,988
Hey.

592
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:19,299
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.

593
00:55:19,354 --> 00:55:21,119
Must've been a rough
couple of years.

594
00:55:21,135 --> 00:55:24,267
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

595
00:55:24,276 --> 00:55:26,580
I think you look great.

596
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:35,741
Yeah. I'm back.

597
00:55:37,015 --> 00:55:38,624
Hi, Bruce.

598
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:45,120
Nat.

599
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,510
This is awkward.

600
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,875
We gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

601
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:55,217
And they can clearly find us.

602
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:57,661
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

603
00:55:57,669 --> 00:56:00,037
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott

604
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:02,379
took a deal. It's too
tough on their families.

605
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:03,950
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

606
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:06,372
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

607
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,396
Okay, look...

608
00:56:07,419 --> 00:56:10,419
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.

609
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:14,379
And he is not gonna
stop until he... He gets...

610
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:17,077
Vision's stone.

611
00:56:17,102 --> 00:56:21,054
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.

612
00:56:22,395 --> 00:56:26,848
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.

613
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:29,129
But also, its composition.

614
00:56:29,172 --> 00:56:31,823
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently

615
00:56:31,835 --> 00:56:33,906
powerful energy
source, something,

616
00:56:33,931 --> 00:56:37,696
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...

617
00:56:38,704 --> 00:56:41,626
Its molecular
integrity could fail.

618
00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:44,079
And you, with it.

619
00:56:44,173 --> 00:56:45,829
We're not having
this conversation.

620
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:48,430
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that

621
00:56:48,455 --> 00:56:53,023
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.

622
00:56:56,959 --> 00:57:00,490
Only you, have the
power to pay it.

623
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:05,781
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.

624
00:57:05,806 --> 00:57:09,237
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.

625
00:57:09,249 --> 00:57:10,396
But it should.

626
00:57:12,201 --> 00:57:13,632
We don't trade lives, Vision.

627
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:18,015
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down
your life to save millions of people.

628
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,149
Tell me, why is
this any different?

629
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,516
Because you might have a choice.

630
00:57:23,782 --> 00:57:27,828
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.

631
00:57:27,837 --> 00:57:31,573
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.

632
00:57:31,612 --> 00:57:35,406
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.

633
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:38,601
- You're saying Vision isn't just a stone?
- I'm saying that...

634
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:42,336
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.

635
00:57:42,345 --> 00:57:45,532
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?

636
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:47,585
Not me. Not here.

637
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:50,929
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

638
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:54,846
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.

639
00:57:56,354 --> 00:57:59,064
I know somewhere.

640
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:15,613
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.

641
00:58:15,638 --> 00:58:17,457
And the Border Tribe?

642
00:58:17,482 --> 00:58:21,669
- Those that are left.
- Send word to the Jabari as well.

643
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:24,271
M'Baku likes a good fight.

644
00:58:25,654 --> 00:58:28,052
And what of this one?

645
00:58:28,301 --> 00:58:30,832
This one may be tired of war.

646
00:58:30,857 --> 00:58:34,778
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.

647
00:58:56,603 --> 00:58:58,353
Where's the fight?

648
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:00,821
On its way.

649
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:22,481
In all the time I
have served Thanos...

650
00:59:23,408 --> 00:59:25,884
I have never failed him.

651
00:59:30,187 --> 00:59:33,585
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,

652
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:37,367
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

653
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:40,274
There would be judgment.

654
00:59:48,715 --> 00:59:50,636
Give me...

655
00:59:54,482 --> 00:59:56,449
the Stone.

656
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,741
Wow. You are a seriously
loyal piece of hardware.

657
01:00:10,757 --> 01:00:12,858
Speaking of loyalty...

658
01:00:13,218 --> 01:00:15,950
- I know what you're gonna say to me.
- You should not be here.

659
01:00:15,975 --> 01:00:16,975
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!

660
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:19,689
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought about...

661
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:20,881
And now I gotta hear it.

662
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:24,037
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

663
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:27,162
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.

664
01:00:27,187 --> 01:00:28,788
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

665
01:00:28,804 --> 01:00:30,351
And now I'm here in space.

666
01:00:30,363 --> 01:00:32,925
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.

667
01:00:32,972 --> 01:00:35,223
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.

668
01:00:35,235 --> 01:00:37,347
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?

669
01:00:37,371 --> 01:00:40,615
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.

670
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,952
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

671
01:00:46,304 --> 01:00:49,850
Okay, that didn't make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.

672
01:00:51,505 --> 01:00:54,548
Come on. We got a situation.

673
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,231
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.

674
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:00,582
Okay, okay.

675
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:03,723
OK, you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?

676
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:09,910
Painful, aren't they?

677
01:01:10,315 --> 01:01:13,730
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.

678
01:01:13,854 --> 01:01:16,072
And any one of them...

679
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:23,548
I could end your friend's
life in an instant.

680
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,697
I gotta tell you, he's
not really my friend.

681
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:29,306
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.

682
01:01:30,025 --> 01:01:31,877
You've saved nothing.

683
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:36,431
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

684
01:01:36,447 --> 01:01:39,103
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

685
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,012
Yes!

686
01:01:53,472 --> 01:01:55,535
Wait, what are those?

687
01:02:09,945 --> 01:02:12,320
Hey, we haven't officially met.

688
01:02:13,023 --> 01:02:14,156
Cool.

689
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:19,569
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.

690
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:21,399
Great, I want to protect the stone.

691
01:02:21,424 --> 01:02:24,197
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.

692
01:02:24,213 --> 01:02:27,181
For what? Nearly
blasting me to space?

693
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,970
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.

694
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,222
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.

695
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:34,565
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.

696
01:02:34,573 --> 01:02:36,393
I tried to bench
you, you refused.

697
01:02:36,418 --> 01:02:38,651
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

698
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:41,194
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut,

699
01:02:41,394 --> 01:02:42,547
billions of miles from Earth,

700
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:43,771
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!

701
01:02:43,796 --> 01:02:46,774
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.

702
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:51,040
I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?

703
01:02:51,065 --> 01:02:54,775
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

704
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,221
Oh, we're using our
made-up names.

705
01:02:57,246 --> 01:02:59,058
I'm Spider-Man, then.

706
01:02:59,277 --> 01:03:02,035
The ship is self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.

707
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:05,644
Can we control it? Fly us home?

708
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:09,992
- Stark.
- Yeah?

709
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:12,797
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. Heard you.

710
01:03:14,047 --> 01:03:17,078
I'm not so sure we should.

711
01:03:17,188 --> 01:03:21,382
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

712
01:03:21,453 --> 01:03:24,015
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.

713
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,374
No. It's you who doesn't
understand that

714
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,961
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years

715
01:03:28,993 --> 01:03:32,336
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!

716
01:03:32,361 --> 01:03:34,431
And I don't know what to do.

717
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:38,067
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.

718
01:03:38,092 --> 01:03:41,521
But you saw. What they
did, what they can do.

719
01:03:41,642 --> 01:03:44,173
At least, let's hope
he's not expecting it.

720
01:03:44,209 --> 01:03:48,281
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.

721
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,771
Do you concur?

722
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:57,031
All right, Stark. We go to him.

723
01:03:57,297 --> 01:03:59,484
But you have to understand...

724
01:03:59,657 --> 01:04:04,157
If it comes to saving you, the
kid, or the Time Stone...

725
01:04:04,212 --> 01:04:07,807
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

726
01:04:07,832 --> 01:04:11,988
I can't. Because the
universe depends on it.

727
01:04:12,013 --> 01:04:15,489
Nice. Good. Moral compass.

728
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:21,057
All right, kid...

729
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,556
You're an Avenger now.

730
01:04:59,154 --> 01:05:01,857
I thought you might be hungry.

731
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:15,818
I always hated that chair.

732
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,631
So I've been told.

733
01:05:17,907 --> 01:05:22,282
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

734
01:05:22,715 --> 01:05:26,496
I hated this room, this ship...

735
01:05:26,642 --> 01:05:29,306
I hated my life.

736
01:05:32,555 --> 01:05:35,303
You told me that, too.

737
01:05:38,202 --> 01:05:40,444
Everyday.

738
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,127
For almost twenty years.

739
01:05:46,632 --> 01:05:49,108
I was a child when you took me.

740
01:05:50,255 --> 01:05:52,630
I saved you.

741
01:05:55,099 --> 01:06:01,135
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

742
01:06:01,183 --> 01:06:05,049
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?

743
01:06:05,074 --> 01:06:09,964
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

744
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,564
You know what's happened since then?

745
01:06:12,597 --> 01:06:16,636
The children born, have
known nothing but full

746
01:06:16,648 --> 01:06:20,268
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.

747
01:06:21,848 --> 01:06:24,262
Because you murdered
half the planet.

748
01:06:24,287 --> 01:06:27,068
A small price to
pay for salvation.

749
01:06:27,185 --> 01:06:30,482
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.

750
01:06:30,507 --> 01:06:33,717
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.

751
01:06:33,742 --> 01:06:37,976
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

752
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:42,239
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!

753
01:06:42,411 --> 01:06:45,286
I'm the only one who knows that.

754
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:49,981
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

755
01:06:51,256 --> 01:06:53,927
For a time...

756
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:55,771
You...

757
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:59,286
had that same will,

758
01:07:00,526 --> 01:07:04,959
as you fought by my side,
daughter.

759
01:07:05,595 --> 01:07:08,352
I'm not your daughter.

760
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,032
Everything I hated about
myself, you taught me.

761
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:17,324
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.

762
01:07:19,907 --> 01:07:23,524
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

763
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:29,547
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

764
01:07:30,032 --> 01:07:32,032
I am disappointed.

765
01:07:32,232 --> 01:07:35,079
But not because
you didn't find it.

766
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:41,435
But because you did.

767
01:07:42,007 --> 01:07:44,231
And you lied.

768
01:08:00,884 --> 01:08:02,587
Nebula!

769
01:08:09,148 --> 01:08:10,664
Don't do this.

770
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:15,096
Sometime ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.

771
01:08:15,121 --> 01:08:18,526
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.

772
01:08:19,024 --> 01:08:23,711
So, I brought her here...
to talk.

773
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:33,729
Stop. Stop it.

774
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:41,611
I swear to you, on my life...

775
01:08:41,686 --> 01:08:45,538
I never found the Soul Stone.

776
01:08:48,339 --> 01:08:49,870
Accessing memory files.

777
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:51,738
You know what he's about to do.

778
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:54,816
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.

779
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:58,926
He'll never get them all.
He can't, Nebula.

780
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:03,044
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.

781
01:09:03,077 --> 01:09:05,725
I burned it.

782
01:09:09,194 --> 01:09:12,014
You're strong.

783
01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:14,873
Me...

784
01:09:16,725 --> 01:09:20,529
The generous... me...

785
01:09:22,548 --> 01:09:25,204
But I never taught you to lie.

786
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,141
That's why you're so bad at it.

787
01:09:29,923 --> 01:09:34,329
Where is the Soul Stone?

788
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,664
Vormir.

789
01:10:10,926 --> 01:10:13,129
The stone is on Vormir.

790
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:18,660
Show me.

791
01:10:20,145 --> 01:10:21,371
I am Groot.

792
01:10:21,571 --> 01:10:23,789
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking for...

793
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:26,496
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.

794
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,757
I am Groot!

795
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,524
You can pour what's
in the cup out in space

796
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:30,781
then go in the cup again.

797
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:31,941
You speak Groot?

798
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:34,079
Yes, the tone on Asgard,
that was an elective.

799
01:10:34,095 --> 01:10:37,204
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.

800
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:41,911
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.

801
01:10:44,339 --> 01:10:46,041
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

802
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,403
It's truly awesome.

803
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,044
Okay. Time to be the captain.

804
01:11:02,949 --> 01:11:06,917
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.

805
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:10,442
Well, he's been dead before.

806
01:11:10,481 --> 01:11:13,801
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.

807
01:11:13,809 --> 01:11:17,707
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.

808
01:11:18,038 --> 01:11:21,702
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.

809
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:25,428
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.

810
01:11:27,598 --> 01:11:31,238
You sure you're up to
this particular mission?

811
01:11:33,031 --> 01:11:34,391
Absolutely!

812
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:37,351
The rage and vengeance, anger...

813
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,258
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.

814
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:43,062
They really clear the
mind, so I'm good to go.

815
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:46,180
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talking about,

816
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,203
he's the toughest there is.

817
01:11:48,228 --> 01:11:50,423
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

818
01:11:50,448 --> 01:11:52,095
He's never fought me twice.

819
01:11:52,426 --> 01:11:54,994
I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.

820
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,769
It better be some hammer.

821
01:12:01,172 --> 01:12:04,257
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

822
01:12:04,281 --> 01:12:06,395
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and

823
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:08,398
every one of them
would've rather killed me

824
01:12:08,423 --> 01:12:10,048
but none succeeded.

825
01:12:10,073 --> 01:12:13,041
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

826
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:16,235
Thanos is just the, latest
in a long line of bastards

827
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:20,444
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

828
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:24,281
And what if you're wrong?

829
01:12:26,703 --> 01:12:29,218
Well, if I'm wrong, then...

830
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,038
What more could I lose?

831
01:12:44,436 --> 01:12:48,896
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.

832
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:54,093
Okay.

833
01:12:55,015 --> 01:12:58,818
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,

834
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:01,382
- you need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?

835
01:13:01,407 --> 01:13:02,543
What's it look like?

836
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:05,821
Some jerk lost a bet
with me in Contraxia.

837
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:08,250
- He gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.

838
01:13:08,274 --> 01:13:11,797
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

839
01:13:13,063 --> 01:13:15,891
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

840
01:13:22,525 --> 01:13:24,963
I would've washed that.

841
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:28,009
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was on my...

842
01:13:28,521 --> 01:13:30,214
Hey, we're here.

843
01:13:34,407 --> 01:13:37,899
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

844
01:13:39,036 --> 01:13:41,606
But it ain't the eye.

845
01:13:54,161 --> 01:13:58,942
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.

846
01:13:58,973 --> 01:14:02,496
And the rings are frozen.

847
01:14:21,432 --> 01:14:25,759
I hope these dwarfs are better at
forging than they are at cleaning.

848
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:33,460
Maybe they realized they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.

849
01:14:33,476 --> 01:14:36,898
The forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.

850
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:42,765
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?

851
01:14:42,781 --> 01:14:45,812
Did it look anything like that?

852
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:52,413
- I am Groot.
- Get back to the pod.

853
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:58,998
Eitri, wait! Stop!

854
01:15:01,557 --> 01:15:03,049
Thor?

855
01:15:05,349 --> 01:15:10,333
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.

856
01:15:10,536 --> 01:15:16,428
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.

857
01:15:17,956 --> 01:15:21,831
Eitri, what did you do?

858
01:15:34,437 --> 01:15:38,382
300 dwarfs lived on this ring.

859
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:42,155
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

860
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:47,006
I made what he wanted.

861
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:52,397
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

862
01:15:56,341 --> 01:15:59,270
And he killed everyone anyway.

863
01:16:01,052 --> 01:16:03,583
All except me.

864
01:16:03,707 --> 01:16:06,988
"Your life is yours," he said.

865
01:16:07,013 --> 01:16:11,747
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."

866
01:16:11,825 --> 01:16:14,536
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.

867
01:16:14,856 --> 01:16:16,755
Every weapon you've
ever designed,

868
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:20,935
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.

869
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:25,075
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.

870
01:16:25,364 --> 01:16:31,263
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.

871
01:17:10,536 --> 01:17:13,121
Mantis, listen very carefully.

872
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,911
I need you to meet me on Titan.

873
01:17:21,962 --> 01:17:24,485
- What's going on?
- I think we're here.

874
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:27,486
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

875
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:31,001
Get your hand inside this.

876
01:17:32,782 --> 01:17:37,047
Then, we got one big dodge, so we
gotta move at the same time.

877
01:17:41,814 --> 01:17:45,821
We might wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!

878
01:18:13,797 --> 01:18:15,820
You all right?

879
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:19,609
That was close.

880
01:18:19,805 --> 01:18:21,648
I owe you one.

881
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,992
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something,

882
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:28,695
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,

883
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,000
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. Understand?

884
01:18:31,024 --> 01:18:33,422
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.

885
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,528
Thanos!

886
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:04,415
Oh, my God! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

887
01:19:12,798 --> 01:19:15,907
Die, Blanket of Death!

888
01:19:20,782 --> 01:19:24,422
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...

889
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,719
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...

890
01:19:27,744 --> 01:19:29,100
Where is Gamora?

891
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:31,859
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

892
01:19:31,884 --> 01:19:35,101
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?

893
01:19:35,126 --> 01:19:38,124
Let him go, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.

894
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:41,791
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and
I'll blast him. Let's go!

895
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:45,481
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.

896
01:19:45,506 --> 01:19:46,465
She's right. You can't.

897
01:19:46,565 --> 01:19:48,319
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?

898
01:19:48,343 --> 01:19:52,257
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself!

899
01:19:52,282 --> 01:19:54,616
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...

900
01:19:54,632 --> 01:19:56,858
Let me ask you this one time...

901
01:19:56,883 --> 01:19:58,984
What master do you serve?

902
01:19:59,008 --> 01:20:02,408
What master do I serve? Am
I supposed to say Jesus?

903
01:20:02,485 --> 01:20:04,674
- You're from Earth.
- Not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

904
01:20:04,698 --> 01:20:07,283
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?

905
01:20:07,308 --> 01:20:11,877
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?

906
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:14,750
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

907
01:20:14,782 --> 01:20:16,577
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

908
01:20:17,169 --> 01:20:18,882
We're the Avengers, man.

909
01:20:19,082 --> 01:20:22,604
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?

910
01:20:22,978 --> 01:20:26,696
Yeah. Tall guy, not
that good-looking.

911
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,703
Where is he now?

912
01:20:43,343 --> 01:20:45,235
This the plan? We'll
hit him with a brick?

913
01:20:45,338 --> 01:20:47,054
It's a mold.

914
01:20:47,684 --> 01:20:52,005
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.

915
01:20:52,599 --> 01:20:54,917
In theory, it could
even summon the Bifrost.

916
01:20:55,178 --> 01:20:56,857
Does it have a name?

917
01:20:58,142 --> 01:20:59,460
Storm breaker.

918
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:02,673
Yeah. It's a bit much.

919
01:21:03,002 --> 01:21:05,322
So how do we make it?

920
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:07,916
You'll have to restart the forge.

921
01:21:09,374 --> 01:21:12,653
Awaken the heart of the dying star.

922
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:17,954
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

923
01:21:19,759 --> 01:21:22,298
What the hell happened
to this planet?

924
01:21:22,323 --> 01:21:24,084
It's 8 degrees off its axis.

925
01:21:24,175 --> 01:21:27,088
Gravitational pull is
all over the place.

926
01:21:27,759 --> 01:21:31,446
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

927
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:34,469
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.

928
01:21:35,717 --> 01:21:38,357
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

929
01:21:38,564 --> 01:21:42,063
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.

930
01:21:42,088 --> 01:21:43,434
Are you yawning?

931
01:21:44,539 --> 01:21:46,719
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?

932
01:21:46,744 --> 01:21:48,455
Did you hear what I said?

933
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:51,166
I stopped listening after you
said that we need a plan.

934
01:21:51,174 --> 01:21:52,199
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.

935
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:54,697
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

936
01:21:54,722 --> 01:21:56,893
What exactly is it that they do?

937
01:21:56,918 --> 01:22:00,089
Kick names, take ass.

938
01:22:06,447 --> 01:22:08,012
All right, just get over here, please?

939
01:22:08,561 --> 01:22:10,878
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?

940
01:22:10,903 --> 01:22:14,090
Star-Lord is fine.

941
01:22:15,248 --> 01:22:16,425
We've gotta coalesce.

942
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:18,498
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

943
01:22:18,506 --> 01:22:22,521
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.

944
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:26,396
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan, except it sucks.

945
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:29,835
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.

946
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,890
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.

947
01:22:31,902 --> 01:22:32,959
What dance-off?

948
01:22:33,059 --> 01:22:35,704
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?

949
01:22:35,728 --> 01:22:39,407
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?

950
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:41,150
It never was.

951
01:22:41,799 --> 01:22:44,580
- We're getting no help with Flash Gordon.
- Flash Gordon?

952
01:22:44,605 --> 01:22:47,214
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.

953
01:22:47,245 --> 01:22:50,346
I'm half-human. So that's
50% of me that's stupid,

954
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:53,501
- And that's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.

955
01:22:53,542 --> 01:22:54,954
Excuse me?

956
01:22:55,611 --> 01:22:59,798
But does your friend
often do that?

957
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:03,282
Strange! You all right?

958
01:23:12,817 --> 01:23:16,387
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hey, what was that?

959
01:23:16,412 --> 01:23:20,568
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures...

960
01:23:20,873 --> 01:23:24,748
To see all the possible
outcomes of the coming conflict.

961
01:23:24,982 --> 01:23:28,857
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.

962
01:23:30,303 --> 01:23:33,123
How many did we win?

963
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:38,223
One.

964
01:23:59,772 --> 01:24:03,030
The Stone had
better be up there.

965
01:24:04,546 --> 01:24:08,116
For your sister's sake.

966
01:24:27,492 --> 01:24:32,898
Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros.

967
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:37,687
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

968
01:24:37,811 --> 01:24:39,162
You know us?

969
01:24:39,194 --> 01:24:43,998
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

970
01:24:44,085 --> 01:24:46,506
Where is the Soul Stone?

971
01:24:46,531 --> 01:24:48,640
You should know,

972
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,312
it extracts a terrible price.

973
01:24:53,202 --> 01:24:55,772
I'm prepared.

974
01:24:57,436 --> 01:25:01,147
We all think that at first.

975
01:25:04,249 --> 01:25:07,264
We are all wrong.

976
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:20,777
How is it you know
this place so well?

977
01:25:20,802 --> 01:25:25,395
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.

978
01:25:25,427 --> 01:25:30,466
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.

979
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:32,739
Banished me here.

980
01:25:32,747 --> 01:25:36,997
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.

981
01:25:45,143 --> 01:25:48,775
What you seek lies
in front of you.

982
01:25:48,932 --> 01:25:52,134
As does what you fear.

983
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:55,611
- What's this?
- The price.

984
01:25:55,697 --> 01:26:00,603
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

985
01:26:01,264 --> 01:26:05,900
You might say it is,
a certain wisdom.

986
01:26:06,935 --> 01:26:08,675
Tell me what it needs.

987
01:26:09,184 --> 01:26:12,443
To ensure
whoever possesses it,

988
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:15,951
understands its power...

989
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:19,881
The Stone demands a sacrifice.

990
01:26:19,965 --> 01:26:21,505
Of what?

991
01:26:21,705 --> 01:26:23,824
In order to take the Stone...

992
01:26:23,856 --> 01:26:27,191
You must lose that
which you love.

993
01:26:29,285 --> 01:26:33,824
A soul, for a soul.

994
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:51,467
All my life, I
dreamed of a day...

995
01:26:51,522 --> 01:26:54,030
a moment...

996
01:26:54,267 --> 01:26:57,119
when you got
what you deserved.

997
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:01,829
And I was always
so disappointed.

998
01:27:04,235 --> 01:27:06,367
But, now...

999
01:27:09,602 --> 01:27:13,047
You kill, and torture,

1000
01:27:14,649 --> 01:27:17,812
and you call it mercy.

1001
01:27:20,594 --> 01:27:23,625
The Universe has judged you.

1002
01:27:24,561 --> 01:27:27,657
You asked it for a prize and

1003
01:27:27,857 --> 01:27:30,068
and it told you, no.

1004
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,896
You failed.

1005
01:27:33,452 --> 01:27:36,061
And do you wanna know why?

1006
01:27:36,295 --> 01:27:38,275
Because you love nothing.

1007
01:27:38,911 --> 01:27:40,336
No one.

1008
01:27:51,508 --> 01:27:55,648
Really? Tears?

1009
01:27:55,805 --> 01:27:58,195
They are not for him.

1010
01:28:11,902 --> 01:28:13,980
No.

1011
01:28:14,487 --> 01:28:17,127
This isn't love.

1012
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:20,636
I ignored my destiny once.

1013
01:28:21,894 --> 01:28:24,168
I cannot do that again.

1014
01:28:24,823 --> 01:28:26,512
Even...

1015
01:28:26,772 --> 01:28:28,770
for you.

1016
01:28:52,232 --> 01:28:55,083
I'm sorry, little one.

1017
01:30:36,459 --> 01:30:39,834
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.

1018
01:30:39,904 --> 01:30:41,659
I hope you're right about this,

1019
01:30:41,681 --> 01:30:44,748
or we're gonna land a lot
faster than you want to.

1020
01:31:00,126 --> 01:31:02,788
When you sad we were going
to open Wakanda to the

1021
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,368
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.

1022
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:07,352
What did you imagine?

1023
01:31:07,377 --> 01:31:11,133
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.

1024
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:28,008
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.

1025
01:31:28,039 --> 01:31:31,164
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1026
01:31:31,843 --> 01:31:35,718
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.

1027
01:31:35,743 --> 01:31:38,315
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1028
01:31:38,327 --> 01:31:40,969
Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1029
01:31:40,985 --> 01:31:43,750
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.

1030
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:47,664
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...

1031
01:31:48,024 --> 01:31:51,633
A semi-stable 100-year old man.

1032
01:31:53,751 --> 01:31:55,430
How have you been, Buck?

1033
01:31:55,455 --> 01:31:58,919
Not bad, for the
end of the world.

1034
01:32:11,496 --> 01:32:14,066
The structure is polymorphic.

1035
01:32:14,105 --> 01:32:17,269
Right. We had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.

1036
01:32:17,285 --> 01:32:22,355
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work collectively?

1037
01:32:22,464 --> 01:32:26,159
Because... we didn't think of it?

1038
01:32:26,175 --> 01:32:29,542
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?

1039
01:32:29,721 --> 01:32:33,103
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.

1040
01:32:33,143 --> 01:32:36,767
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.

1041
01:32:36,838 --> 01:32:40,439
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?

1042
01:32:40,464 --> 01:32:43,510
As long as you can give me.

1043
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:50,932
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1044
01:33:05,474 --> 01:33:08,036
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.

1045
01:33:17,209 --> 01:33:19,654
God, I love this place.

1046
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:24,325
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.

1047
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,024
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.

1048
01:33:46,049 --> 01:33:49,649
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.

1049
01:33:49,651 --> 01:33:54,400
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.

1050
01:33:54,425 --> 01:33:55,494
I will.

1051
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:59,095
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...

1052
01:33:59,112 --> 01:34:02,603
and get this man a shield!

1053
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:13,625
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.

1054
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:16,440
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving,

1055
01:34:16,452 --> 01:34:18,884
you need something bigger
to yank them loose!

1056
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:21,017
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1057
01:34:21,025 --> 01:34:25,079
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a wrong plan...

1058
01:34:32,509 --> 01:34:35,078
Fire the engines!

1059
01:34:51,035 --> 01:34:54,511
More power, rabbit!

1060
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:27,658
Well done, boy.

1061
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:32,081
That's Nidavellir!

1062
01:35:50,858 --> 01:35:53,904
- Damn it.
- What's damn it?

1063
01:35:53,929 --> 01:35:55,991
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?

1064
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:58,228
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.

1065
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:02,268
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1066
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:06,845
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.

1067
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:09,987
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1068
01:36:18,747 --> 01:36:22,762
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1069
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:30,065
It's so amazing! It's like being
the Hulk without actually...

1070
01:36:32,888 --> 01:36:34,669
I'm okay.

1071
01:36:36,395 --> 01:36:40,129
I got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.

1072
01:37:07,062 --> 01:37:09,538
Thank you for standing with us.

1073
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:11,554
Of course, brother.

1074
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:33,682
Where's the other friend?

1075
01:37:33,706 --> 01:37:36,565
He will pay for his
life with yours.

1076
01:37:36,979 --> 01:37:39,830
Thanos will have that stone.

1077
01:37:39,901 --> 01:37:41,368
That's not gonna happen.

1078
01:37:41,393 --> 01:37:43,924
You are in Wakanda now.

1079
01:37:43,964 --> 01:37:48,463
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.

1080
01:37:48,589 --> 01:37:50,263
We,

1081
01:37:50,463 --> 01:37:53,213
have blood to spare.

1082
01:38:03,963 --> 01:38:08,189
- They surrender?
- Not exactly.

1083
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:19,741
Yibambe!

1084
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:21,045
Yibambe!

1085
01:38:21,171 --> 01:38:22,848
Yibambe!

1086
01:38:34,191 --> 01:38:36,979
What the hell?

1087
01:38:38,697 --> 01:38:41,431
Looks like we pissed her off.

1088
01:38:51,362 --> 01:38:54,010
They're killing themselves.

1089
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:30,703
See the teeth on those things?

1090
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:33,432
Alright, back up, Sam. They
ain't get your wings yet.

1091
01:39:45,287 --> 01:39:47,843
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,

1092
01:39:48,012 --> 01:39:49,763
there's nothing between
them and Vision.

1093
01:39:49,963 --> 01:39:51,889
Then we better keep
them in front of us.

1094
01:39:51,914 --> 01:39:54,310
How do we do that?

1095
01:39:55,558 --> 01:39:57,746
We open the barrier.

1096
01:39:59,358 --> 01:40:03,804
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.

1097
01:40:03,852 --> 01:40:06,131
<i>Requesting confirmation, my King.</i>

1098
01:40:06,141 --> 01:40:08,023
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1099
01:40:08,032 --> 01:40:11,664
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.

1100
01:40:12,258 --> 01:40:16,640
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

1101
01:40:28,758 --> 01:40:30,586
Wakanda forever!

1102
01:40:30,797 --> 01:40:32,695
Wakanda forever!

1103
01:40:42,945 --> 01:40:43,988
Now!

1104
01:41:14,278 --> 01:41:17,251
- How much longer, Shuri?
- We've barely begun, brother.

1105
01:41:17,409 --> 01:41:20,001
You might want to
pick up the pace.

1106
01:41:26,269 --> 01:41:28,386
All fathers, give me strength.

1107
01:41:28,411 --> 01:41:29,788
You understand, boy?

1108
01:41:30,103 --> 01:41:33,536
You're about to take the
full force of a star.

1109
01:41:34,192 --> 01:41:36,192
It'll kill you.

1110
01:41:36,411 --> 01:41:38,903
And if I die?

1111
01:41:38,942 --> 01:41:43,981
Yes, that's what,
killing you means.

1112
01:42:10,892 --> 01:42:13,681
Hold it, hold it, Thor!

1113
01:43:03,074 --> 01:43:06,167
Thor? Say something, come on.

1114
01:43:06,426 --> 01:43:09,120
Thor, you okay?

1115
01:43:12,636 --> 01:43:16,971
- I think he's dying.
- He needs the axe.

1116
01:43:17,705 --> 01:43:20,423
Where's the handle?

1117
01:43:22,025 --> 01:43:25,697
Tree! Help me find the handle.

1118
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:35,324
There's too many of them!

1119
01:45:02,826 --> 01:45:05,522
You guys are so screwed now!

1120
01:45:08,764 --> 01:45:11,990
Bring me Thanos!

1121
01:45:43,467 --> 01:45:45,303
Oh, yeah.

1122
01:45:47,922 --> 01:45:51,235
You're much more of a Thanos.

1123
01:45:52,367 --> 01:45:55,375
I take it that Maw is dead?

1124
01:45:56,476 --> 01:45:59,850
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1125
01:46:00,992 --> 01:46:03,671
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1126
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:05,217
You may regret that.

1127
01:46:05,417 --> 01:46:09,468
He brought you face-to-face with
a Master of the Mystic Arts.

1128
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:15,124
Where do you think
he brought you?

1129
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:19,378
Let me guess.
Your home?

1130
01:46:22,653 --> 01:46:24,552
It was.

1131
01:46:26,552 --> 01:46:29,552
And it was beautiful.

1132
01:46:30,544 --> 01:46:32,743
Titan was like most planets.

1133
01:46:32,943 --> 01:46:36,052
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1134
01:46:36,075 --> 01:46:40,192
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1135
01:46:40,278 --> 01:46:42,442
Genocide?

1136
01:46:42,467 --> 01:46:46,787
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.

1137
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:50,263
And they called me a madman.

1138
01:46:50,405 --> 01:46:54,607
And what I predicted,
came to pass.

1139
01:46:55,593 --> 01:46:57,938
Congratulations. You're a prophet.

1140
01:46:58,281 --> 01:46:59,671
I'm a survivor.

1141
01:46:59,687 --> 01:47:02,116
Who wants to murder trillions.

1142
01:47:02,195 --> 01:47:06,202
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1143
01:47:06,265 --> 01:47:11,400
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1144
01:47:12,752 --> 01:47:15,541
And then what?

1145
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,578
I finally rest.

1146
01:47:17,778 --> 01:47:21,658
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1147
01:47:22,307 --> 01:47:26,525
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1148
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:32,674
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

1149
01:47:32,994 --> 01:47:34,923
"Our"?

1150
01:47:39,866 --> 01:47:44,569
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

1151
01:48:21,915 --> 01:48:23,844
Boom!

1152
01:48:24,313 --> 01:48:26,813
Don't let him close his fist.

1153
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:33,664
Magic! More magic!

1154
01:48:33,899 --> 01:48:35,034
Magic with a kick!

1155
01:48:35,356 --> 01:48:37,387
Magic with a...

1156
01:48:37,628 --> 01:48:39,409
Insect.

1157
01:49:16,557 --> 01:49:18,985
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.

1158
01:49:19,147 --> 01:49:22,295
Would have been a
waste of parts!

1159
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,773
Where's Gamora?

1160
01:50:08,426 --> 01:50:09,886
Is he under? Don't let up.

1161
01:50:09,911 --> 01:50:12,723
Be quick. He is very strong.

1162
01:50:12,739 --> 01:50:16,648
Parker, help. Get over here. She
can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1163
01:50:23,897 --> 01:50:26,617
I thought you'd be harder to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1164
01:50:27,535 --> 01:50:29,316
Not so strong now, huh?

1165
01:50:29,754 --> 01:50:32,253
Where's Gamora?

1166
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:35,971
- My Gamora!
- Oh, bullshit!

1167
01:50:36,003 --> 01:50:38,393
Where is she?

1168
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:41,666
- He is in anguish.
- Good.

1169
01:50:42,572 --> 01:50:43,572
He...

1170
01:50:43,597 --> 01:50:45,320
He mourns.

1171
01:50:45,344 --> 01:50:49,719
What does this monster
have to mourn?

1172
01:50:49,992 --> 01:50:51,953
Gamora...

1173
01:50:54,539 --> 01:50:56,007
What?

1174
01:50:56,031 --> 01:51:02,960
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.

1175
01:51:04,076 --> 01:51:08,083
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, understand?

1176
01:51:08,552 --> 01:51:11,942
Don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1177
01:51:13,075 --> 01:51:16,356
Tell me she's lying.

1178
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:19,950
Asshole! Tell me
you didn't do it.

1179
01:51:21,004 --> 01:51:24,683
I had to...

1180
01:51:24,885 --> 01:51:27,886
No you didn't.

1181
01:51:30,839 --> 01:51:34,300
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1182
01:51:34,449 --> 01:51:35,962
Just stop! Stop!

1183
01:51:36,162 --> 01:51:39,527
It's coming, I got it, I got it!

1184
01:51:42,345 --> 01:51:44,423
Oh, God.

1185
01:52:42,509 --> 01:52:46,040
Come and get some, face-dogs!

1186
01:52:48,134 --> 01:52:51,071
Come on! Get some, get some!

1187
01:52:53,321 --> 01:52:56,094
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1188
01:52:56,141 --> 01:52:58,844
Okay, how much for the arm?

1189
01:52:59,735 --> 01:53:02,297
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1190
01:53:10,608 --> 01:53:14,201
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.

1191
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:18,365
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.

1192
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:20,944
I am Groot!

1193
01:53:21,554 --> 01:53:23,944
I am Steve Rogers.

1194
01:53:43,128 --> 01:53:46,119
Fall back! Fall back now!

1195
01:53:54,484 --> 01:53:57,069
Focus all fire on the
left flank, Sam.

1196
01:53:57,094 --> 01:53:59,210
I'm doing it.

1197
01:54:21,879 --> 01:54:24,144
Why was she up there
all this time?

1198
01:54:24,199 --> 01:54:27,660
She's on the field. Take it.

1199
01:54:58,467 --> 01:55:01,904
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.

1200
01:55:03,803 --> 01:55:06,920
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.

1201
01:55:06,945 --> 01:55:08,452
On my way.

1202
01:55:13,201 --> 01:55:16,138
He'll die alone. As will you.

1203
01:55:16,146 --> 01:55:18,107
She's not alone.

1204
01:55:43,498 --> 01:55:45,505
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

1205
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:47,677
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This

1206
01:55:47,689 --> 01:55:49,944
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.

1207
01:55:54,368 --> 01:55:57,696
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.

1208
01:55:58,906 --> 01:56:02,632
Hulk? I know you're not making your
entrance 'till the last second.

1209
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:06,671
This is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

1210
01:56:09,827 --> 01:56:13,577
Hulk! Hulk!
Shit, Hulk!

1211
01:56:14,171 --> 01:56:19,905
- No!
- Screw you, you big, green asshole!

1212
01:56:19,913 --> 01:56:23,475
I'll do it myself. Come on.

1213
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:38,321
See ya!

1214
01:56:48,949 --> 01:56:51,847
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1215
01:57:02,537 --> 01:57:04,857
I thought you were a formidable machine.

1216
01:57:05,717 --> 01:57:08,367
But you're dying, like any man.

1217
01:57:16,649 --> 01:57:18,734
Get outta here!

1218
01:57:21,446 --> 01:57:23,375
Go!

1219
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:43,109
That's really gross.

1220
01:58:09,697 --> 01:58:12,439
I thought I told you to go.

1221
01:58:12,517 --> 01:58:15,212
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1222
01:58:25,356 --> 01:58:28,059
I got you, I got you!

1223
01:58:28,090 --> 01:58:30,840
Sorry I can't remember
any of your names.

1224
01:59:15,265 --> 01:59:18,116
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1225
01:59:18,609 --> 01:59:23,398
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1226
01:59:24,908 --> 01:59:27,103
A fake.

1227
01:59:34,057 --> 01:59:37,846
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1228
01:59:37,916 --> 01:59:40,338
- Stark.
- You know me?

1229
01:59:40,814 --> 01:59:45,642
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.

1230
01:59:46,392 --> 01:59:48,540
My only curse is you.

1231
02:00:18,996 --> 02:00:22,386
All that for a drop of blood.

1232
02:01:05,051 --> 02:01:07,620
You have my respect, Stark.

1233
02:01:08,582 --> 02:01:12,636
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1234
02:01:17,331 --> 02:01:20,479
I hope they remember you.

1235
02:01:29,481 --> 02:01:31,473
Stop.

1236
02:01:36,864 --> 02:01:41,824
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.

1237
02:01:44,423 --> 02:01:46,938
No tricks.

1238
02:01:50,696 --> 02:01:52,758
Don't!

1239
02:02:43,219 --> 02:02:45,484
One to go.

1240
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:57,139
Where is he?

1241
02:03:04,987 --> 02:03:08,088
Did we just lose?

1242
02:03:10,425 --> 02:03:13,533
Why would you do that?

1243
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:18,908
We're in the endgame now.

1244
02:03:43,658 --> 02:03:45,978
Are you okay?

1245
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:50,118
What? What is it?

1246
02:03:51,173 --> 02:03:53,603
He's here.

1247
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:08,282
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.

1248
02:04:09,141 --> 02:04:12,172
What the hell?

1249
02:04:37,313 --> 02:04:40,602
Cap. That's him.

1250
02:04:42,101 --> 02:04:45,835
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1251
02:05:09,493 --> 02:05:12,571
Wanda. It's time.

1252
02:05:12,610 --> 02:05:13,704
No.

1253
02:05:13,904 --> 02:05:16,016
They can't stop him,
Wanda. But we can.

1254
02:05:16,063 --> 02:05:19,298
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

1255
02:05:19,323 --> 02:05:22,211
- Don't.
- You must. Please...

1256
02:05:23,378 --> 02:05:26,730
We are out of time.

1257
02:05:26,755 --> 02:05:31,364
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.

1258
02:05:32,663 --> 02:05:36,694
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.

1259
02:05:37,225 --> 02:05:38,611
It's not fair.

1260
02:05:40,065 --> 02:05:42,881
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1261
02:05:43,608 --> 02:05:45,130
It's all right.

1262
02:05:46,089 --> 02:05:48,803
You could never hurt me.

1263
02:05:57,239 --> 02:06:00,590
I just feel you.

1264
02:07:38,305 --> 02:07:40,515
I love you.

1265
02:08:09,274 --> 02:08:12,070
I understand, my child.

1266
02:08:12,751 --> 02:08:15,720
Better than anyone.

1267
02:08:16,017 --> 02:08:18,376
You could never.

1268
02:08:22,803 --> 02:08:26,685
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1269
02:08:27,529 --> 02:08:31,114
But now is no time to mourn.

1270
02:08:32,381 --> 02:08:34,310
Now...

1271
02:08:34,381 --> 02:08:37,951
is no time at all.

1272
02:08:59,897 --> 02:09:02,662
No!

1273
02:09:58,757 --> 02:10:01,319
I told you...

1274
02:10:01,538 --> 02:10:05,264
You'd die for that.

1275
02:10:18,035 --> 02:10:20,426
You should have...

1276
02:10:22,089 --> 02:10:24,744
You...

1277
02:10:25,854 --> 02:10:29,955
You should have
gone for the head!

1278
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:33,730
No!

1279
02:11:05,415 --> 02:11:07,852
Daughter?

1280
02:11:14,338 --> 02:11:16,580
Did you do it?

1281
02:11:17,672 --> 02:11:20,078
Yes.

1282
02:11:27,089 --> 02:11:29,987
What did it cost?

1283
02:11:32,181 --> 02:11:35,306
Everything.

1284
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:46,128
What did you do?

1285
02:11:47,058 --> 02:11:49,682
What did you do?!

1286
02:12:02,136 --> 02:12:04,323
Where did he go?

1287
02:12:06,714 --> 02:12:08,761
Thor...

1288
02:12:10,824 --> 02:12:12,433
Where did he go?

1289
02:12:12,535 --> 02:12:14,792
Steve?

1290
02:12:48,501 --> 02:12:50,671
Up, General, up!

1291
02:12:51,464 --> 02:12:53,000
This is no place to die.

1292
02:13:07,942 --> 02:13:10,012
I am Groot...

1293
02:13:10,036 --> 02:13:11,293
No.

1294
02:13:12,106 --> 02:13:16,449
No. No. No. No! Groot...

1295
02:13:16,737 --> 02:13:18,705
No...

1296
02:13:31,185 --> 02:13:33,911
Sam?

1297
02:13:36,443 --> 02:13:39,950
Sam, where you at?

1298
02:13:47,290 --> 02:13:50,805
Something's happening...

1299
02:14:01,585 --> 02:14:04,069
Quill?

1300
02:14:10,174 --> 02:14:13,681
- Stay, Quill.
- Oh, man...

1301
02:14:16,877 --> 02:14:18,572
Tony.

1302
02:14:21,354 --> 02:14:25,416
There was no other way.

1303
02:14:29,743 --> 02:14:31,852
Mr. Stark?

1304
02:14:35,001 --> 02:14:38,547
I don't feel so good...

1305
02:14:38,727 --> 02:14:42,649
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...

1306
02:14:43,867 --> 02:14:47,273
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Mr. Stark, please...

1307
02:14:47,298 --> 02:14:50,031
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

1308
02:14:54,099 --> 02:14:57,263
I'm sorry.

1309
02:15:10,417 --> 02:15:12,886
He did it.

1310
02:15:36,651 --> 02:15:40,542
What is this? What the
hell is happening?

1311
02:15:56,810 --> 02:15:59,669
Oh, God.

1312
02:16:43,173 --> 02:16:47,517
Subbed by: iamdepressed
Resynched+fixed by Clarity.

1313
02:26:54,935 --> 02:26:55,991
Search for Stark.

1314
02:26:56,091 --> 02:26:57,124
No not yet.

1315
02:26:57,224 --> 02:27:00,212
I'm watching every satellite above
kind of searching Stark over there.

1316
02:27:01,326 --> 02:27:04,793
- What is it?
- Multiple bogets from wakanda.

1317
02:27:04,993 --> 02:27:06,731
Same energy signatures
as in New York?

1318
02:27:06,931 --> 02:27:08,352
10 times bigger.

1319
02:27:09,543 --> 02:27:11,402
Call Clint. We'll meet him...

1320
02:27:25,713 --> 02:27:27,411
They okay?

1321
02:27:27,611 --> 02:27:29,241
There is no one here.

1322
02:27:39,448 --> 02:27:41,316
Call control.

1323
02:27:41,516 --> 02:27:43,275
Code RED.

1324
02:27:43,475 --> 02:27:45,098
Nick.

1325
02:27:46,214 --> 02:27:47,250
No!

1326
02:28:02,317 --> 02:28:04,075
Oh no!

1327
02:28:14,398 --> 02:28:19,865
SENDING...

1328
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:27,061
Captain Marvel.
