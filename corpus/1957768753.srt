1
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:14,080
(insects chirring) (suspenseful music)

2
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,432
- [Sergeant] Company, move out.

3
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:37,437
(static buzzing) (suspenseful music)

4
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,476
Move, down.

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,213
Prepare to fire.

6
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:53,653
Fire on target.

7
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,557
(gunshots booming)

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,795
- [Corporal] Nice shooting, Tex.

9
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,163
Looks like you started a fire.

10
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,672
- [Sergeant] Pull back, soldier.

11
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,875
- [Soldier] I'm just gonna stomp out the fire, Sarge.

12
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,645
(static buzzing)

13
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,749
(Geiger counter crackles)

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,917
- Corporal, do you have a reading on that smoke?

15
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,121
- Yes, sir, it's showing nothing, Sergeant.

16
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,827
(hissing) (coughing)

17
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,800
- [Sergeant] Check your seals, we're under attack.

18
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,004
- [Corporal] I still don't get a reading, Sergeant.

19
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:49,843
- [Sergeant] Comm, this is Black Arrow, Comm, come in.

20
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,846
We are under gas attack, we need immediate extraction.

21
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,882
This is not a drill; I repeat, this is not a drill.

22
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,717
We are under gas attack.

23
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,420
(static buzzing)

24
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,257
Comm, We are under chemical attack.

25
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,627
I repeat, We are under chemical attack.

26
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,930
(groaning and coughing)

27
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,247
- [Comm] Black Arrow, this is Comm, Black Arrow.

28
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,117
Black Arrow, Black Arrow.

29
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,053
(orchestral music)

30
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,359
- Well, how's he doing?

31
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,193
- Look.

32
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,766
(birds twittering)

33
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,604
30 minutes. - 30 minutes?

34
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,405
That's not bad.

35
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,409
- 10 miles in 30 minutes; I'd say he's doin' pretty good.

36
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,045
In fact, better than I'd hoped.

37
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,613
He's stronger and faster; hey, Pope!

38
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:15,682
- Yeah!

39
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,551
- Are you tired? - Not at all!

40
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,154
- All right then, be ready.

41
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,256
We'll move on to the second part of the test.

42
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,257
- Okay, what's that?

43
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,028
(suspenseful music)

44
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:37,570
(grunting) (blows thudding)

45
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,773
(orchestral music)

46
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,184
Good job, Pope. - Thanks.

47
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,954
Morning, Cain. - How do you feel?

48
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:55,788
- A little stiff.

49
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,825
Nothing a weekend in Maui wouldn't cure.

50
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,127
- Unlikely.

51
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,895
- That's too bad.

52
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,865
My tan's beginnin' to fade.

53
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,035
- Pope, Joint Security Operations

54
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,037
has invested a lot of money and resources

55
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,372
into enhancing your abilities.

56
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,975
I think it's time we put 'em to good use, don't you?

57
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,580
- Guess that means no trip to Maui, huh?

58
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,449
- [Sergeant] Comm, this is Black Arrow; Comm, come in.

59
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,787
We are under gas attack, we need immediate extraction.

60
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,423
This is not a drill, I repeat, this is not a drill.

61
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,692
We are under gas attack, do you read?

62
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,660
Comm. - Black Arrow,

63
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,396
this is Comm, Black Arrow!

64
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,069
- What you just heard took place eight hours ago

65
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,071
on a UN peacekeeping patrol in Bosnia.

66
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,874
The chemical pierced the protective suits,

67
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,176
and they were dead in less than a minute.

68
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,012
- What was the chemical? - We don't know.

69
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,981
It left very few traceable deposits.

70
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,785
- Do you want me to find out where it came from?

71
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,419
- Oh, we know where it came from.

72
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,261
- I am Commander Yurdovich,

73
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,764
of Serbian Independence Organization.

74
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,835
We are responsible for launching the deadly chemical

75
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,605
offensive against UN forces deployed here.

76
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,242
We are demanding the United Nations remove all troops

77
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,443
from our region.

78
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,281
If the UN fails to comply with our demands,

79
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,418
we will be forced to begin an aggressive campaign

80
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,021
against all non-Serbian forces.

81
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:42,528
I am granting the UN 72 hours to begin the withdrawal.

82
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,202
- Yurdovich is a former Special Forces operative.

83
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,737
One day, he just cleared out his desk and left.

84
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,508
For a couple of years, even the CIA couldn't find him.

85
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,576
But they finally did.

86
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,912
- I'm supposed to take him out?

87
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,380
- Ah, that'd be too easy.

88
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,083
And it wouldn't stop his men from launching the gas.

89
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:04,917
- What would?

90
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,153
- You.

91
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,889
- Why did I know that?

92
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,058
- If the UN were to pull out, Yurdovich's group

93
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,227
would overrun all of former Yugoslavia.

94
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,997
The Joint Security Organization and the UN

95
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,365
are calling an emergency meeting

96
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,400
before Yurdovich's deadline.

97
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,236
You will go to the region

98
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,538
and disarm Yurdovich's chemical weapons

99
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,240
before the end of that meeting.

100
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,544
This is Agent Delilah Shane.

101
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,916
- [Pope] Where'd you find her, Cain?

102
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,985
- [Cain] Our MIT recruitment program.

103
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,319
- MIT, huh?

104
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,288
- She's better than good, Pope.

105
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,357
You're the only one who can get close to those weapons.

106
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,026
We think the enhancements to your body

107
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,795
will keep you from being affected by the chemical.

108
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,298
- What if they don't? - Then it's a one-way trip.

109
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,734
- Fair enough.

110
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,905
At least I'll have her all to myself.

111
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,841
- Not quite.

112
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,509
Dylan Pope, Agent Ted Marks.

113
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,911
- Pleasure. - How you doin'?

114
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,113
- Gentlemen, these radios are excellent

115
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,981
for short-range communication.

116
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,517
The scrambling technology is state of the art.

117
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:15,955
And this shirt here is equipped with smoke-bomb buttons.

118
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,925
Just snap 'em off, press both sides to activate.

119
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,597
(explosion booming)

120
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,032
Standard ballpoint pen.

121
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,268
Twist the rear section counterclockwise,

122
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,003
it becomes a laser.

123
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,905
Press the retractor and...

124
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,574
(laser sizzles)

125
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,411
But please be careful.

126
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,845
It could burn a hell of a lot more than a hole

127
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,314
in your pocket.

128
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,149
Camera with a built-in flash, except this is new,

129
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:43,983
pay attention.

130
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,385
You press the button,

131
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,889
and it increases the flash power 500 times.

132
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,257
Watch your eyes.

133
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,293
It'll cause total blindness in five minutes.

134
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,964
Now you should know about these.

135
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,567
Mini-grenades, twist the cap to arm,

136
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,336
and bam, in five seconds.

137
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,738
Free anesthetic, free fragmentation.

138
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,607
Excellent anti-personnel weapon.

139
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
- Yeah, they came in real handy

140
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,042
last couple places I worked.

141
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:14,146
- Where'd you work? - Panama, Beirut, Los Angeles.

142
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,650
- When you arrive at your destination,

143
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,552
you'll come as tourists.

144
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,954
Right above the port is a small castle.

145
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,757
A restaurant, really.

146
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,292
You'll find Agent Shane there.

147
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,628
She'll arrange for you to meet up with a former KGB contact.

148
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,765
Then he'll take you directly to Yurdovich's compound.

149
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,066
And from there, gentlemen,

150
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,203
you're on your own.

151
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,005
- We're used to that.

152
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,874
(orchestral music)

153
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:58,824
She looks capable.

154
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,626
- Don't they all?

155
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,431
- Right there.

156
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,367
(orchestral music)

157
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,339
(ship's horn honks)

158
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,242
(speaking faintly)

159
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,613
(surf roaring)

160
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,586
- Do you think she'd come down?

161
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,321
- [Ted] I don't think so.

162
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,489
- Nah, I don't either.

163
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,733
(suspenseful music)

164
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,534
- Hello.

165
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,904
I'm Delilah Shane.

166
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,105
- Ted Marks.

167
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,006
- I'm your liaison.

168
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,476
- I know it's politically incorrect, but

169
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,979
you are beautiful.

170
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,882
- You can save your charm, Agent Pope.

171
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,584
Your reputation precedes you.

172
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,321
Now I've arranged to have a car meet us

173
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,723
in the next village.

174
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,324
From there, we'll meet our next contact,

175
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,960
who will lead us to Yurdovich's compound.

176
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,794
- Sounds easy.

177
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,867
- It never is.

178
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,740
(suspenseful music)

179
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,577
One o'clock! (gunshots booming)

180
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,516
- Friends of yours? - Nope.

181
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:35,454
(gunshots booming) (ominous music)

182
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,197
Think they'll stand still for a photo?

183
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,932
- [Ted] I think so.

184
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,801
(gunshots booming)

185
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,936
(beeping)

186
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,207
(explosion booming) (yelling)

187
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,376
(gunshots booming)

188
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,612
(groaning)

189
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,349
(body thuds)

190
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,254
- I didn't think they'd be onto us so quickly.

191
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,355
- You okay?

192
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,322
- Yeah.

193
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,824
- Did you pay the docking fee?

194
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,828
(orchestral music)

195
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,539
- All clear.

196
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,841
- For now. (Delilah sighs)

197
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,975
- You know, I bet those

198
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,544
are some of Yurdovich's men back there.

199
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,279
- I hope not. - Why?

200
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
- Means there's a leak or a mole.

201
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,185
- Don't know who to trust, huh?

202
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,589
(orchestral music)

203
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,006
- Now the car that's picking us up

204
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,408
will meet us right over here at the market.

205
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,243
- I hope we don't have to do much walking.

206
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,045
- Hey, it's only about a block away.

207
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,049
- Okay, we're all-American tourists.

208
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,820
You and I will be a couple.

209
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,288
Marks here can be my brother.

210
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,592
- Okay.

211
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,961
We're gonna take the front, so you watch our backs.

212
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,663
- Anything else?

213
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,465
- Listen, we're here to protect Pope and get him

214
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,735
to his destination, and I happen to know this country.

215
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,836
You got a better idea?

216
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,706
- No offense meant.

217
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,575
- None taken.

218
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,477
Come on, let's go.

219
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,586
(shoppers talking faintly)

220
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,511
- Don't eat too many of those.

221
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,114
- You and I'll work it off tonight.

222
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,456
- Where's that car of yours?

223
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,292
- Katrina's never failed me.

224
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,727
She's from the old school, she's one of the best.

225
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,630
- She'd better hurry, we're about to be ambushed.

226
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,435
- Damn, you're good.

227
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:38,971
- Instinct.

228
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,609
(shoppers talking faintly)

229
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,091
(gunshots booming)

230
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,795
- Marks!

231
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,731
(gunshots booming)

232
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,016
- Damn.

233
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,487
You're Ar-vee-ta? - No, I'm her niece, Natasha.

234
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,557
- Would you be kind enough to get us the hell out of here?

235
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,424
- Yes, of course.

236
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,428
(tires squealing)

237
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,364
(rooster squawks)

238
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,266
(glass clattering)

239
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,945
(tires squealing) (clamoring)

240
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,094
- [Ted] Someone in central's on us, Pope.

241
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,996
- [Pope] Yeah, I got the same feelin'.

242
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,000
Duck! (suspenseful music)

243
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,903
(gunshots booming)

244
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,122
(groaning)

245
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,924
(gunshots booming)

246
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,193
(groaning)

247
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,197
(somber music)

248
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,366
(yelling)

249
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:49,868
Bazooka!

250
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,239
(explosion booming)

251
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,912
You did good back there.

252
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,846
- Just doin' my job.

253
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,985
- Okay, I understand.

254
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,454
Uh oh.

255
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:12,191
- Roadblocks are common in this country.

256
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,767
- Papers. - Please.

257
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,975
- Is your name really Natasha?

258
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,210
- [Natasha] Today, it is.

259
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,613
- You from a fishing village?

260
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,916
- No, my family was from Sarajevo, they sent me here.

261
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,018
- Really, they stayed?

262
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,120
- They were executed.

263
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,324
(somber music)

264
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,158
- I'm sorry.

265
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,095
- There are thousands like me.

266
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,231
- I doubt that.

267
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,336
- I don't know your mission, but perhaps when it is done,

268
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,170
we'll meet again.

269
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,540
- Possibly dinner.

270
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,445
- Done, and a walk by the sea.

271
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,313
- Bring it on. - Okay.

272
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,648
(Pope and Natasha laughing)

273
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,651
- Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt you,

274
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,287
but could you please tell me how much further it is?

275
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,456
- 16 kilometers.

276
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,290
- Thank you.

277
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,165
- You know if you stop hating me for a minute,

278
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,402
I might grow on you.

279
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,236
- Like a tumor?

280
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,105
- More like caviar.

281
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,074
- Well, I hate fish.

282
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,245
- Of course.

283
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,953
(orchestral music)

284
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,828
- Get me Yurdovich.

285
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,665
(dramatic music)

286
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,329
- You must change your clothes in the back.

287
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,897
- Damn, that car's windy.

288
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,665
- That's a Serbian convertible.

289
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,468
- You guys don't take anything seriously, do you?

290
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,271
(engine rumbling)

291
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,655
- You want some binoculars?

292
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,723
- Might come in handy.

293
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,092
- How 'bout you, Marks?

294
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,166
- Those government issue?

295
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,936
- For you, restricted.

296
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,684
- [Natasha] This is a safe house.

297
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,452
- Looks like a haunted house to me.

298
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,123
(eerie music)

299
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,763
- The bunkers are here to be below the ground.

300
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:46,204
This first tunnel here...

301
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,374
A-dee-ta!

302
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,543
(sobs) - She's dead.

303
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,778
(clicking) - Dive!

304
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,647
(gunshots booming)

305
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,996
(explosion booming) (gunshots booming)

306
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,602
(dramatic music)

307
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,970
- [Delilah] Which way out of here?

308
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,106
- [Natasha] This tunnel goes to the mountain.

309
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,575
- [Pope] Let's go!

310
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,781
(explosion booming)

311
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,350
- I didn't think it'd be so dangerous for you.

312
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,851
- It's okay, I'm with you now.

313
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,022
- Okay, I'll catch up to you, okay?

314
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,025
(suspenseful music)

315
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,668
- Marks, back there?

316
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,503
- [Delilah] You wait here.

317
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,176
- [Pope] Marks?

318
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,279
- Marks!

319
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,449
Marks.

320
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,324
(coughing)

321
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,194
(orchestral music)

322
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,230
- [Pope] Marks.

323
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,231
Marks.

324
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,500
(gunshots booming)

325
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,634
Marks, can you hear me?

326
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,205
Dammit!

327
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,909
(suspenseful music)

328
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,445
Look out, let's go.

329
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,421
- Pope.

330
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,596
- I wanna stay a few minutes and wait for Marks.

331
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,100
- Marks is dead.

332
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,071
Besides, we're running out of time.

333
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,113
- Yeah.

334
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,417
(orchestral music)

335
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,465
Uh oh, trouble ahead.

336
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,102
I'd like to start avoiding these altogether.

337
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:31,937
- Agreed.

338
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,239
Hold on!

339
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,976
(dramatic music)

340
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:44,816
(Delilah whooping and laughing)

341
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,650
- Good drivin'!

342
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,021
(suspenseful music)

343
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,023
- I don't think they liked that trick too much.

344
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:57,028
(gunshots booming) (soldiers clamoring)

345
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,465
There's not much chance we can lose 'em

346
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,000
on this straight road.

347
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,235
- Maybe we don't have to.

348
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,976
(explosion booming)

349
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,912
(gunshots booming)

350
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,516
- It didn't even seem to faze them.

351
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,651
- Maybe these will.

352
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,288
(orchestral music)

353
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,457
(beeping)

354
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,661
(explosion booming)

355
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,132
- They're still comin'.

356
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:34,966
- Ah, hell.

357
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,675
(gunshot booming)

358
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,681
- Damn!

359
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,251
- Good one. - Thanks.

360
00:25:59,157 --> 00:25:59,991
- Hey, Natasha.

361
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,929
Do you know anybody that can help us get to Yurdovich?

362
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,298
- Maybe someone.

363
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,735
(jazz music)

364
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:15,407
(patrons speaking and laughing faintly)

365
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,477
- I hope you don't plan on

366
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,512
drinking too many of those tonight.

367
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,615
- You're beginning to sound like my ex-wife.

368
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,386
- The information you want is available, for a price.

369
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,456
- Well, we're willing to pay your price,

370
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,558
if you can guarantee that it's accurate.

371
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,559
- It's guaranteed.

372
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,201
- All right then, tell us.

373
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,707
- Yurdovich's compound is located 100 kilometers from here.

374
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:49,541
Near Dubrovnik.

375
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,245
You can get there by car, but a car will be spotted

376
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,246
20 kilometers south.

377
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,182
I suggest you walk.

378
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,522
As for his weapons, it's near the compound.

379
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,791
- Where?

380
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,259
- Nearby.

381
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,427
- That's not good enough, for what we're paying.

382
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,864
- I can provide you with safe house there.

383
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,800
The code: the sun is red.

384
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,769
The reply will be, the moon is not.

385
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,772
You'll meet an old man.

386
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,375
He'll have the information you need.

387
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,209
- He'd better.

388
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,646
- It's guaranteed.

389
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,488
- So your reputation didn't include an ex-wife.

390
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,925
- That was a long time ago.

391
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,494
I like to keep it that way.

392
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,565
Just keep walkin'.

393
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,901
- What? - Keep walkin'.

394
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:53,538
Don't turn around.

395
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:54,973
Keep movin'.

396
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,076
(suspenseful music)

397
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:02,247
There you go.

398
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:07,252
(laser sizzles) (exclaiming)

399
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,021
(dramatic music)

400
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,229
(tires squealing)

401
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,316
Don't stop for any fares.

402
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,287
- You got it. (gunshot booming)

403
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,356
(tires squealing)

404
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,259
(gunshots booming)

405
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,963
- [Stanson] I couldn't help noticing who you were after.

406
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,300
- Do you know them? - It's guaranteed.

407
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,004
- You know, I don't think we can trust

408
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,873
Stanson's information.

409
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:02,974
- Don't have a choice.

410
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,510
There's only 48 hours until

411
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,178
Yurdovich carries out his threat.

412
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,514
- Stakes are high.

413
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,617
- That's what makes the game exciting.

414
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,224
- Uh oh, looks like we got us some company.

415
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,128
(dramatic music)

416
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:31,669
- Watch your eyes.

417
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:39,277
(flashbulb pops) (tires squealing)

418
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,656
(explosion booming)

419
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:56,828
All right.

420
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:58,730
Scored.

421
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,501
- God, I hope those were the bad guys.

422
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,335
- Me too.

423
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,963
(birds twittering)

424
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:37,101
(speaking faintly) (orchestral music)

425
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,003
- Welcome to all my guests.

426
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,909
Let us celebrate the new Serbia that tomorrow will bring.

427
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:53,251
(orchestral music) (birds twittering)

428
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,361
- [Pope] We better walk from here.

429
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,662
- I thought you didn't like to walk.

430
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,365
- I don't.

431
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:13,564
(panting)

432
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,401
- I see the safe house, 200 yards.

433
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,142
Wanna have a look?

434
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,410
(Delilah gasps)

435
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,377
- Put me down!

436
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,049
Let's go, I...

437
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:32,950
- This way.

438
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,383
(suspenseful music)

439
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:20,832
Hello?

440
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,275
(knocking at door)

441
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,276
Anybody home?

442
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,831
- [Delilah] Hello?

443
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,504
- The sun is red?

444
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,974
(guns click)

445
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,075
- And the moon is not.

446
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,014
(upbeat music)

447
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,835
- [Dwarfman] Put that on.

448
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,937
- Guess I'm not dressed appropriately.

449
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:33,771
- Now.

450
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,820
- Aren't you at least gonna be a gentleman

451
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,754
and turn your back?

452
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,291
Guess not.

453
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:02,300
- [Yurdovich] Welcome, Mr. Pope, please have seat.

454
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,202
- I'd rather stand.

455
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,739
- You killed many of my men.

456
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,610
You are impressive.

457
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,246
- Pleasure was all mine.

458
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,253
- And mine.

459
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,558
- You are a very beautiful woman, Agent Shane.

460
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,965
In the new Serbia, I think this will be the uniform

461
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,799
for all women.

462
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,237
- I guess you're not one for equal rights.

463
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,875
- A woman has one right:

464
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,478
to serve men.

465
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,750
- I think I will sit down.

466
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,387
(piano music)

467
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,165
- Thank you.

468
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,550
- '64, roo-sont.

469
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,618
- Oh.

470
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,590
- Very good year.

471
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,792
- You are a man of fine taste.

472
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,827
As am I.

473
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,000
She is the youngest of my wives.

474
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:48,739
I have 15.

475
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,281
I believe in the ancient ways of kings.

476
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,154
- Murder's a very interesting trade.

477
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,223
- But, this is a war.

478
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,193
And war is not murder.

479
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:16,334
- So what are your intentions?

480
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,937
- To create a new Serbian empire.

481
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,380
How do you feel, Mr. Pope?

482
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:34,418
- You um, drugged my wine.

483
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,490
- Merely a precaution.

484
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,659
- Son of a bitch.

485
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,665
- I'd like to know about your enhancements, Mr. Pope.

486
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,635
- What is he talking about?

487
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,636
- Agent Shane!

488
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,574
Please do not insult my intelligence.

489
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,777
I'd sooner kill you than have that.

490
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,283
You know what I'm talking about,

491
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,953
don't you, Mr. Pope?

492
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,092
Very well.

493
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,399
Let me have you pay a visit to Dr. Chu.

494
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,837
He has extraordinary methods for regaining memory.

495
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,110
- [Chu] These rats have been starved for weeks.

496
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,846
They will chew through anything when given the chance.

497
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,919
(suspenseful music)

498
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:02,840
You have 30 seconds. (chuckling)

499
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,785
(rats squeak)

500
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,755
Tell me about your enhancements, Agent Pope.

501
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,257
- What is he talking about?

502
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:22,493
- It's classified.

503
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:50,121
All right, stop.

504
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,523
I'll tell you.

505
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,658
- Pope, don't tell him anything.

506
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,293
- Don't you see it doesn't matter?

507
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,295
He'll kill us anyway.

508
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,532
- Tell me now, or I raise the gate.

509
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:06,537
- The secret is, you're a dead man. (grunting)

510
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,678
(Chu exclaiming)

511
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,081
(Chu grunts)

512
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:36,667
(squelching) (groaning)

513
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,637
(suspenseful music)

514
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,139
(rat squeaks) - Sorry, friend.

515
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,475
Lunch's gonna have to wait.

516
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,847
(orchestral music)

517
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,831
- [Delilah] Pope!

518
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,205
- Jump!

519
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:18,509
Now!

520
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,580
(Delilah gasps)

521
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,148
Are you ready? - Always.

522
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,119
(dramatic music)

523
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,291
- Fire!

524
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:37,228
(gunshots booming)

525
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,602
- Surround the area.

526
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:46,670
And bring him back.

527
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,106
Alive.

528
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,786
(orchestral music)

529
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,985
- [Delilah] I can't run in this outfit.

530
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,320
I have to rest.

531
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,689
- [Pope] Come on, we don't have time.

532
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,424
They're right behind us.

533
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,258
Without weapons, we're sitting ducks.

534
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,296
(Delilah panting)

535
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,697
- I have to stop. - Okay.

536
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,034
Okay?

537
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,105
- You haven't even broken a sweat.

538
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,173
Who are you, Superman?

539
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,642
(chuckling)

540
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,743
- No, not quite.

541
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:09,153
- So where do you think Yurdovich will spray the chemicals?

542
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,054
- Not around here.

543
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,256
- Why do you say that?

544
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,327
- This is Yurdovich's home, not a weapons depot.

545
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,562
- Yeah, but what about Stanson's information?

546
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:20,664
You think he was wrong?

547
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,134
- Worse.

548
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,438
- He tipped off Yurdovich.

549
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,239
- Exactly.

550
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:32,576
Sh.

551
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,747
- I don't hear anything.

552
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:40,918
- I do, come on.

553
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,654
(dramatic music)

554
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:00,537
- Pope, please, I have to catch my breath.

555
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,375
- We don't have time to rest.

556
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,276
Now I'm not leaving you,

557
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:12,783
but I will carry you if I have to.

558
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:18,956
- And here I was supposed to be the one protecting you.

559
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,159
(dramatic music)

560
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,529
(gunshots booming)

561
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:29,767
(men groaning and yelling faintly)

562
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,821
- [Natasha] Hi, you two okay?

563
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,423
- What are you doing here?

564
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,458
- I felt bad, so I followed you.

565
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,728
Well, I've brought you some stuff.

566
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,273
- Where is Agent Pope?

567
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:11,308
- He escaped.

568
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,478
- Where are the rest of your men?

569
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:16,647
- Dead.

570
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,120
- The threat he possesses might be much greater

571
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,954
than we thought.

572
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,323
- I doubt that.

573
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,928
Don't worry about Pope, I'll handle him.

574
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,463
- How?

575
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,731
- While you're at the UN meeting with Cain,

576
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:35,999
I'll track down Pope and find out

577
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,501
if he's immune to the chemical.

578
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:42,940
- I agree.

579
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,978
Dwarfman and his men will be under your command.

580
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:52,749
- What men is that?

581
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,595
(birds twittering)

582
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,568
- Welcome to the JSO, Mr. Ambassador.

583
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:14,304
- Thank you; I've just received a bit of good news.

584
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,039
- I could certainly use some.

585
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,909
- Yurdovich has agreed to attend the negotiations.

586
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,978
We'll convene the meeting here tomorrow.

587
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,881
- That's excellent, sir; now it's just up to Pope.

588
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:27,050
- The Pope? - No, sir, Agent Pope.

589
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,422
(orchestral music)

590
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,180
(waves lapping)

591
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,016
- It's a good thing you knew about

592
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,250
the paths through the valley.

593
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,485
- They won't find us here.

594
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:04,821
- Natasha,

595
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,458
where does Yurdovich keep his chemicals?

596
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,597
- I don't know, why are you asking me?

597
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,233
- Stop playing games with me, right now.

598
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,272
You set up a meeting with Stanson for us,

599
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:28,078
when you knew where Yurdovich was all the time.

600
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,280
Didn't you?

601
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,082
- No.

602
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,751
(ominous music)

603
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,325
- She does know about those chemicals.

604
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,362
- Yeah.

605
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,001
(dramatic music)

606
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,904
(gunshots booming)

607
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,688
- Come on, let's get the hell outta here!

608
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,423
(gunshots booming)

609
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,692
(groaning)

610
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,330
- Sorry, Natasha, there's just too much at stake.

611
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,769
(orchestral music)

612
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,473
(groaning)

613
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,846
- This way.

614
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,972
(Pope painting)

615
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,941
All right, let's rest here.

616
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,975
- [Pope] My pleasure.

617
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,682
- How are you feeling? - Better.

618
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:12,516
The pain's gone.

619
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,453
- Lemme get some water and I'll wash that wound.

620
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:41,511
All right, now let me know if I hurt you here, okay?

621
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,718
Oh my God.

622
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:51,521
- The wound has already closed, hasn't it?

623
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,990
- How?

624
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,558
- Can't tell you.

625
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:55,792
- Yeah, but the bullet...

626
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:58,595
- An X-ray would show

627
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,999
it had already been dissolved by my body.

628
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,336
- Who are you?

629
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,307
- An agent, like you.

630
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,913
- No, you're not like me, this is unreal.

631
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,219
I know that it's our job to keep secrets,

632
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,353
but I wish you trusted me.

633
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:25,389
- I do.

634
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,126
It's just sometimes it's better not to know things.

635
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,530
- Okay, answer me one question.

636
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,600
- Okay. - Are you human?

637
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:44,374
- Very.

638
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,911
(orchestral music)

639
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,780
- Good.

640
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,751
(insects chirring) (wolves howling)

641
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,625
(orchestral music)

642
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:25,215
Well, I just finished washing our clothes out.

643
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,416
I was having a really hard time

644
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:30,020
getting all the blood out of your shirt.

645
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,089
- That's not surprising.

646
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:38,095
I've been trying to get it off my hands for years.

647
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:44,668
- So why did you become an agent?

648
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:49,506
- Why'd you?

649
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,075
- I don't know,

650
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:57,047
I thought this would be an interesting career choice.

651
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:02,018
- An interesting career choice.

652
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:07,224
- Yeah, what about you?

653
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:14,564
- I love the game.

654
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:19,669
I live for it.

655
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,939
- Is that all this is to you?

656
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:27,944
Just a game?

657
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:33,984
- Not right now.

658
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:42,459
You cold?

659
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:47,464
- Not right now.

660
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,402
(orchestral music)

661
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,988
(suspenseful music)

662
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:22,912
- Still no word?

663
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,983
- I'm afraid not, sir.

664
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,122
- I shall inform the general consul

665
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,357
that unless your man succeeds,

666
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,893
we intend to accept their demands.

667
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,662
- I have the utmost confidence in Agent Pope, sir.

668
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:40,964
- Let's hope you're right.

669
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,901
(suspenseful music)

670
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:54,110
(birds twittering)

671
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,047
- [Ted] Pope.

672
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,151
- Marks?

673
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:05,455
- [Ted] Do you read me, over.

674
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,590
- Marks, is that you?

675
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,392
- [Ted] Yes.

676
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:22,238
(cattle lowing) (suspenseful music)

677
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,109
- There he is.

678
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,839
- You're not gonna believe what happened to me.

679
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,340
I just went as fast as I could,

680
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,376
the smoke was so thick I ran smack into a wall,

681
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,412
head first, knocked me flat out.

682
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,647
(laughing)

683
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:07,250
- Ooh, that's bad.

684
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,288
- What took you so long to find us?

685
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:13,623
- You guys are hard to track.

686
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:16,826
Where's Natasha?

687
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,229
- Yurdovich's men gunned her down at the lake.

688
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:20,396
- I can't believe that.

689
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:29,038
I spoke to Cain; the UN's convening the emergency meeting.

690
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,607
- Yurdovich gonna be there?

691
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,408
- He's there, happenin' as we speak.

692
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:34,143
- So then how much time do we have?

693
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:37,046
- Cain said it's not gonna last much past dinnertime.

694
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:37,881
- Shit.

695
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,783
You know, we don't even know where the chemicals are.

696
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:41,618
- Yes, we do.

697
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:48,224
(choral music)

698
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,726
Cain's confirmed that the chemicals are held

699
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,427
in that church on top of the mountain.

700
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,897
- So all we gotta do is get inside?

701
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,698
- It's easier said than done.

702
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,200
There are 30 armed men around that church.

703
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,335
- That's 10 apiece.

704
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,109
- Okay, let's get to it.

705
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,112
(suspenseful music)

706
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:26,529
- As the UN representative, I call this emergency meeting

707
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:29,899
of the International Arbitration Committee to order.

708
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,035
Commander Yurdovich will speak first.

709
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,779
- The Serb Federation's position is clear.

710
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:47,450
Our demands remain in force.

711
00:59:48,584 --> 00:59:52,221
Unless the West has something new to impart,

712
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:56,359
we will carry out our plan as scheduled.

713
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:02,065
- Commander Yurdovich, the UN General Consul

714
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,900
has advised me to inform you

715
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,036
that any aggressive action on the Serbian Federation part

716
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,372
will be met by equal force by the UN.

717
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:17,146
- Ambassador, I doubt that the UN is

718
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,382
willing or capable

719
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,784
of launching a chemical offensive against anyone.

720
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:27,223
Therefore, Mr. Ambassador, I call your bluff.

721
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,162
- We're here to negotiate, Commander,

722
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,031
and that's what we're prepared to do.

723
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,570
(dramatic music)

724
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:49,645
- Well, looks like there's more than 10 apiece.

725
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:50,913
- I like a good challenge.

726
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,852
- You know, we can't all be super-agents like you, Pope.

727
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,086
- You know, she's right.

728
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,388
Lemme go up around the other side

729
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,522
and see if we can get in from there.

730
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:00,890
- Why don't we all go?

731
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,026
- Let's not risk more of us than we have to.

732
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,594
I'll just check it out, be right back.

733
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:08,931
- Okay. - Okay.

734
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,437
- I hope your man comes through.

735
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,272
I don't know how much longer we can stall.

736
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:17,473
- Well, we don't know the full extent

737
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,475
of his chemical arsenal, do we, sir?

738
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,309
- No.

739
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,613
- Well, maybe we can beat Yurdovich at his own game.

740
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:24,614
- What is that game?

741
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:26,649
- Poker, sir.

742
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:46,102
- I think, Commander, you'll find the caviar here excellent.

743
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:49,205
- I have caviar every day, Mr. Cain.

744
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,173
- I see you know me.

745
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:56,412
- Of course, we're in the same line of business, aren't we?

746
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,714
- I don't know about that, Commander.

747
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:00,883
But what I do know, as we speak,

748
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,786
the UN forces are in a position to defend

749
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,388
against your chemical offensive.

750
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:08,491
- I'm not so sure about that.

751
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,160
- We are, sir.

752
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,233
- Would you ever consider getting involved

753
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,634
with somebody you work with?

754
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:25,174
- Well, I guess that would depend on who that someone is.

755
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,144
You know, this line of work doesn't really lend itself

756
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,045
to a gentle heart.

757
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,614
- Yeah, I used to think that.

758
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:34,350
Not anymore.

759
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,624
- I might consider your offer, under one condition.

760
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,060
- What?

761
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,561
- That we both get outta here alive.

762
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,398
Deal?

763
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,233
- Deal.

764
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:55,605
(gunshots booming)

765
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,039
Stay here.

766
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,674
- Wait, I'm going with you.

767
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,309
- No, it's okay.

768
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,379
I want you here.

769
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,826
(gunshots booming)

770
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,396
- Hey, you fuckin' idiot, hold your fire.

771
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,167
(gunshot booming)

772
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,304
(suspenseful music)

773
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,883
You talk to Yurdovich?

774
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:41,717
- No.

775
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,754
- Then the plan's the same.

776
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,356
I get Pope into the church, expose him to the chemicals.

777
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:53,863
I know how bad you want Pope.

778
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,932
But under no circumstances are you gonna get him.

779
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,602
He is mine.

780
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:02,205
- What do we get? - Agent Shane,

781
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:05,741
she'll tell you everything you need to know.

782
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,611
- What are you gonna do with Pope?

783
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:12,181
- I'm gonna kill him.

784
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,983
- All right.

785
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,594
(sighs)

786
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:25,428
- What's wrong?

787
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,831
- It's Marks.

788
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:29,665
- Is he dead?

789
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,569
- He's workin' for Yurdovich.

790
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:44,880
- So what now?

791
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,753
- We go along with the plan.

792
01:04:57,493 --> 01:05:01,430
- Ambassador, these negotiations are growing stale.

793
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:06,068
If your tactic is to stall, it will do no good.

794
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:10,506
You see, I know about your plan to destroy my weapons.

795
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:15,011
But what Mr. Cain here doesn't know

796
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,913
is that his man will not find my weapons.

797
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,717
They are already deployed in the areas

798
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,153
where they will be used.

799
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:27,423
On my command, the weapons will be remotely activated.

800
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:29,892
And, Ambassador,

801
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:34,063
I'm getting closer to giving that command.

802
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,634
- Commander, am I to understand

803
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,904
that you're aware of the JSO's Agent Pope?

804
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:45,975
- He and I have had the pleasure of meeting.

805
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,479
- I've been authorized to disclose to you

806
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,949
that Agent Pope has been involved in the JSO program

807
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,918
known as Operation Phoenix.

808
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,689
- Yes, Ambassador, I know all about Operation Phoenix.

809
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:00,489
- Commander?

810
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:02,958
Let me inform you of what you don't know

811
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,160
about Operation Phoenix.

812
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:10,966
There are 50,000 soldiers under the NATO command

813
01:06:10,966 --> 01:06:12,568
who are immune to your chemical.

814
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:17,873
- The UN has authorized the offensive deployment

815
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,876
of these companies, to force the unconditional surrender

816
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:22,511
of all troops under your command,

817
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,413
and all those who are part of your cause.

818
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:27,249
Therefore, your chemical threat does not warrant

819
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,085
the demands you make.

820
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:31,420
(chuckling)

821
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:37,159
- In that case, maybe I should give the command right now.

822
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:42,298
- If you do, then the UN is in a position to retaliate

823
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,432
with extreme prejudice.

824
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:49,939
- There is one problem with your position, Ambassador.

825
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:56,078
You don't know for sure whether Agent Pope or anyone else

826
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,181
is immune to the chemical.

827
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:06,689
Is that really a chance the UN is willing to take?

828
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,063
- Okay, I found a way into the church

829
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,065
that's harder for them to defend.

830
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,299
- What is it?

831
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,768
- The perimeter's only protected on this side.

832
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,002
So if you go around the back side,

833
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:21,670
you might be able to create a diversion

834
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,606
that's gonna draw 'em off the church.

835
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:26,208
Then we just slip in, and I figure we're gonna be safe

836
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,177
'cause they're not gonna wanna go near the chemical.

837
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:30,713
What do you think? - Sounds easy.

838
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:32,748
- It just might be.

839
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,384
- What do you think?

840
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,619
- Well, I think that I should stay here

841
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,354
until the weapons are destroyed.

842
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,157
Then I get back into town and inform Cain.

843
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:41,991
- That's good.

844
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,095
- I agree.

845
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,775
- Let's split up, create two diversions.

846
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,478
- No, I don't think so, I think we should stick together.

847
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:03,913
- Why?

848
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,347
- Well, 'cause you're our best man,

849
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,282
they're gonna think they're being surrounded,

850
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,350
they won't blow up the church.

851
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,185
- Good thinkin'.

852
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,063
(gunshots booming)

853
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:32,475
- She's an agent, Pope, she'll be all right.

854
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:37,480
Come on.

855
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,187
- Hey!

856
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:48,090
(gunshots booming)

857
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,129
It's not nice to sneak up on a girl like that.

858
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,940
- [Ambassador] You know, Cain, your bluff

859
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:08,077
with the NATO forces may have worked for the time being.

860
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,646
But how much longer do you think we can stall?

861
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,014
- [Cain] As long as it takes.

862
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:14,083
- What are you talking about?

863
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,518
Yurdovich is a loose cannon.

864
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:18,420
He'll release the gas, even if unprovoked.

865
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,889
(chuckling)

866
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,191
- That's what he wants you to think, Ambassador.

867
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,293
Yurdovich is here to bargain.

868
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,028
He's not gonna give up his only chip.

869
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,701
- So what do you recommend we do next?

870
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,371
- We wait.

871
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:37,072
- [Ambassador] Wait, for what?

872
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:38,974
- Same thing Yurdovich is waiting for.

873
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:44,079
If Pope is immune to the chemical, we win.

874
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:46,682
- And if he's not?

875
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,220
- Then you pack your bags and go home.

876
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:01,397
(choral music)

877
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:16,245
- Okay, once we set off the explosives,

878
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,781
most of the soldiers gonna go and check it out.

879
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:20,516
Whoever's left, we're gonna have to handle.

880
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,218
- Then we'll blow up the church.

881
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:25,287
- We can't blow up the church.

882
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:26,622
The chemicals'll spread through the whole region

883
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,123
and kill everybody.

884
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:31,260
No, you've gotta go into the church and disarm the weapons.

885
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,995
That'll give Cain the time he needs.

886
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,364
- You comin' with me?

887
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,468
- My job was to bring you here.

888
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:42,871
If the chemicals leak, chances are, it's not gonna harm you,

889
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:44,340
but it's gonna kill me.

890
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,276
- Okay, let's do it.

891
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,245
(explosion booming)

892
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,387
(somber music)

893
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:05,060
(explosion booming)

894
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,366
- Good luck, Pope.

895
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,201
(dramatic music)

896
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,802
- [Dwarfman] Go go go, go go go!

897
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,217
- Just as I thought.

898
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:30,653
Now we don't have to deal with as many.

899
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:33,822
- Yeah, that's right.

900
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,428
After you.

901
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,839
(laser sizzles)

902
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:53,042
(groaning)

903
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:58,847
- Say cheese!

904
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:05,087
(flashbulb pops) (yelling)

905
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,092
(gunshots booming)

906
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:18,634
- He's gonna get us both, go on!

907
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:20,402
Watch out.

908
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:22,271
Pope, get in the church; go on, go!

909
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,942
(groaning)

910
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:31,246
(dramatic music)

911
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,484
(yelling)

912
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:52,735
I could have handled that guy.

913
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,137
- No, you couldn't; let's go.

914
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:02,144
(orchestral music)

915
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,483
- [Ted] We made it.

916
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:17,926
Hey, Pope.

917
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:22,731
- Yeah? - Good luck, man.

918
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,167
- Thanks.

919
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,736
(somber music)

920
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,639
Shit.

921
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:31,473
- What?

922
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,176
- Door's locked.

923
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,444
- The door can't be locked.

924
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,045
- Yeah, it is; you wanna try it?

925
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:43,652
- Get inside the church, Pope.

926
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,723
- What a surprise; you're the mole.

927
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:48,557
- That's right.

928
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:53,796
- Money? - Yeah, a lot of it.

929
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,664
You know, the chemicals aren't even in the church.

930
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,100
And the command center's in town.

931
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,636
- So why do you want me to go inside?

932
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,407
- 'Cause I left a few chemicals just for you.

933
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,810
Just to see exactly how enhanced you really are.

934
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,413
- I guess this means we're not gonna be friends anymore.

935
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:15,384
- Always the funny man, aren't you, Pope?

936
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,352
Get in the fuckin' church.

937
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:22,357
- Okay.

938
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,432
(suspenseful music)

939
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,379
(clicking)

940
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:48,116
(somber music)

941
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:20,616
- He's dead, let's go!

942
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,394
- I have an announcement to make, gentlemen.

943
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,900
Apparently someone had a little trouble with gas.

944
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:42,938
Agent Pope is dead.

945
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:55,784
(door bangs)

946
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:58,520
(dramatic music)

947
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,645
(somber music)

948
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,485
- The UN has reconsidered, and is prepared

949
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,053
to accept some of your demands.

950
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:07,289
- I'm sorry, Ambassador.

951
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,025
That will not be acceptable.

952
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,428
The terms have now changed,

953
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,366
and this meeting is over.

954
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:23,238
(dramatic music)

955
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:43,258
- Commander Yurdovich, (speaking in foreign language)

956
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:47,763
Yes.

957
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,532
- What are the orders?

958
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:51,333
- We wait.

959
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:05,681
(Pope sighs)

960
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,617
(orchestral music)

961
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:16,058
(suspenseful music)

962
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:44,352
(gunshots booming)

963
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,372
(gun clatters)

964
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:43,178
(suspenseful music)

965
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:10,505
- I guess this is where I get off.

966
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:16,845
- Who we got here?

967
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,017
You're one tough lady, aren't you?

968
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,052
- You're one slime-bag piece of shit.

969
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:29,558
- Insults excite me.

970
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,561
(Delilah cries out)

971
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,601
(spits)

972
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:46,174
She's yours, Dwarfman.

973
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,243
(explosion booming)

974
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,712
(speaking in foreign language)

975
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,914
(gunshots booming)

976
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:53,982
After him!

977
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,685
(dramatic music)

978
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:09,364
(gunshots booming)

979
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:31,486
(groaning)

980
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:34,489
(suspenseful music)

981
01:21:39,894 --> 01:21:40,729
Dwarfman.

982
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:57,145
(orchestral music)

983
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:15,430
(clattering)

984
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:38,119
- You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would you?

985
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:38,954
- Sure I would.

986
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:43,625
But I don't have to.

987
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,731
(clattering)

988
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:54,402
(suspenseful music)

989
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:59,307
(grunting) (bones snapping)

990
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,810
(somber music)

991
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:09,517
(dramatic music)

992
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:11,419
(Delilah cries out) - Set 'em off!

993
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:12,220
- [Pope] Marks!

994
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:17,392
- Don't try me.

995
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:21,463
- Let her go.

996
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:23,798
- I'll blow her head off.

997
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:25,700
- Do it, Pope! - You got it, baby.

998
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:31,740
(crackling) (groaning)

999
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:35,043
(explosion booming)

1000
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:46,788
You okay?

1001
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:49,858
- You just kill that bastard.

1002
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,192
- You stay here.

1003
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:55,430
(suspenseful music)

1004
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,345
(grunting)

1005
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:24,526
I'm with ya!

1006
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:27,862
Friend!

1007
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,258
(grunting)

1008
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:05,166
- Pope!

1009
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,736
(yelling)

1010
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,972
(thudding)

1011
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:13,541
(somber music)

1012
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,963
- Congratulations, you accomplished your mission.

1013
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,166
- But what about Yurdovich?

1014
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,735
- As it were, Yurdovich wasn't much of a threat.

1015
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:42,337
He only had a small amount of gas,

1016
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:44,439
and that was stolen from a lab in Germany.

1017
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:46,608
- What?

1018
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:50,745
- You mean the whole mission was to sniff out a mole?

1019
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,882
- But what about the command post?

1020
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,116
- That was to fool Marks.

1021
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:59,621
You see, Yurdovich wasn't quite sure he could trust him.

1022
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:00,555
Turns out, he could.

1023
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:04,325
- You're leavin' something out, Cain, what is it?

1024
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:08,229
- Unfortunately, it was our scientists

1025
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:09,397
who developed the gas.

1026
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:13,034
It was the most lethal threat to mankind

1027
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:14,135
since the atomic bomb.

1028
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:17,705
We had to find out if our antidote worked.

1029
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:22,210
You were the guinea pig.

1030
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:25,046
- Guinea pig.

1031
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,247
- That's the game, Pope.

1032
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:33,388
Delilah, don't unpack; your next mission is in Damascus,

1033
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,390
and you're going to Zaire.

1034
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,525
- No, no no, game's over.

1035
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:41,095
- The game is never over.

1036
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:43,865
What else is there that you can do?

1037
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:47,168
- I'm checkin' out Damascus.

1038
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:51,839
(orchestral music)

1039
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:56,731
(slow orchestral music)
