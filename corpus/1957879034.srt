00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,580
( tower bells tolling )

00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,999

3
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,905
( all chattering )

4
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,848
( cheering )

5
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,352
Philippe Leclerc!

6
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,880
Philippe's voice:
In 1955 when I was 18

7
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,450
I was afforded,
in the words of my
favorite teacher,

8
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,453
an interlude
of inestimable value--

9
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,256
a scholarship to
Asheland-Stuart University

10
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,758
in Virginia.

11
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,435
( train whistle blows )

12
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,838
- I'll take that from you.
- Pardon?

13
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,340
I'll carry that
for you.

14
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,342
No, thank you.

15
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,278
Fine.
The college is that way.

16
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,388

No, Philippe Leclerc
is my name.

48
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,465
Yeah, right.
Okay, Lucky Pierre...

49
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,801
Philippe's voice:
That is what Frenchmen
were called in those days--

50
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,404
an allusion
to our mythical ways
with the ladies.

51
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,507
My advice, Phil,
for what it's worth--

52
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,509
go whole hog.

53
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,710
Whole hog?

54
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,746
Yeah, jump in
with both feet,

55
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,218
really involve yourself,
join the band,

56
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,653
the debating society,
that sort of thing.

57
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,655
But I don't play
an instrument.

58
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,657
I see.

59
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,659
Well, that is a pity.

60
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,394
Any sports?

61
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,896
Yes, football.

62
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,898
For real?

63
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,433
Yes.

64
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,636
I scored nine goals
last spring.

65
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,239
No shit.
We call them
touchdowns over here.

66
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,743
- Wide receiver, right?
- Of course.

67
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,012
Boy, you guys
have guts.

68
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,416
( boys chattering )

69
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,895
All right, girls,
practice practice.

70
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,430
- Hey, it's Cal.
- Cal, how are you doing?

71
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,432
Hey, buddy.

72
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,434
- Right on, Cal.
- Hey, Cal.

73
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,436
Hi, coach.

74
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,273
Philippe's voice:
That was Cal Parnell Cate,

75
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,275
our quarterback.

76
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,011
They just didn't make them
that way in France.

77
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,548
They still don't.

78
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,451
So is this the Frenchy
I'm supposed to try out?

79
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,154
He scored nine TDs
in Paris.

80
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,156
Oh, really?
Paris, Texas?

81
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,259
No, Paris, France.

82
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,429
Okay, kid, let's go.

83
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,065
It's your funeral.

84
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,601
Paris, eh?

85
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,603
( exhaling rhythmically )

86
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,471
Coach:
Keep it up, keep it up.

87
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,777
That's not good enough.
Come on now.

88
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,083
Come on,
keep it up.

89
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,586
All right, Frenchy,
now you tell the chief--

90
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,588
and no forked tongue--

91
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,457
you ever play this game?

92
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,292
No.

93
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,294
Just what you call
soccer.

94
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,296
Now I got to be square
with you, pilgrim,

95
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,366
this here game--
it ain't for everyone,
you know?

96
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,301
I mean, you got to like
getting hit.

97
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,803
( yelling )

98
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,405
Hey, you like
getting hit?

99
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,007
I don't know.

100
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,211
All right, forget it.
Forget it.

101
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,213
Just go out for a pass.

102
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,215
All right,
you see this line?

103
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,683
Yes, I do.

104
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,952
Okay, tenderfoot,
this here is a 30-yard line

105
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,721
we're standing on now,
all right?

106
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,457
When I say "hut hut"
you are gonna

107
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,026
run like hell
down to the 20-yard line,

108
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,196
turn around and
catch this here sucker.

109
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,132
I want you to concentrate
on the point of
the football.

110
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,635
And don't think.

111
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,940
Hut hut!

112
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,746
All right, Frenchy,
you're quick.

113
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,181
Hey, next time
you catch that ball
with your hands,

114
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,751
all right, never ever
with the chest.

115
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,552
Okay, let's go.

116
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,855
Let's go.
Let's do it again.

117
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,225
Hut hut!

118
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,204
( thunder rumbling )

119
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,411
Lay low.
Chief Shitting Bull
just arrived.

120
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,781
Mr. Cate,
Mr. Cal Cate,

121
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,717
you think you're gonna
be able to quarterback
this football team

122
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,619
with a beer gut, huh?

123
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,855
Who's your little
playmate?

124
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,857
Phil Leclerc
from Paris, France.

125
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,459
Just messing around.

126
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,294
Nobody messes around
on my field, mister.

127
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,197
We play full-out
or not at all.

128
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,266
Go out for a pass, boy.

129
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,303
Hut hut!

130
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,810
What kind of
silly shit is that?
You lost your arm too?

131
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,812
Throw him a bullet.

132
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,081
You don't want
to jam his fingers
first day out, do you?

133
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,816
Put some zip on it.

134
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,187
All right, kid, listen.
I'm gonna throw it hard--

135
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,423
real hard, okay?
So listen, whatever you do,

136
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,193
catch it with
your palms this time,
not your fingers,

137
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,695
or you'll never
play piano again.

138
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,931
I don't play piano, Cal.

139
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,000
Hut hut!

140
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,507
Oh, nice hands.

141
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,509
Let's see if he can
take a hit.

142
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,511
Come on, coach,
that's bullshit.

143
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,580
Why don't you give
the guy a break?

144
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,749
Football's
a man's game, Mr. Cate.
Men get hit.

145
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,418
The sooner we find out
if he can take it, the better
it is for all of us.

146
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,421
Lewis, cover the kid.

147
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,655
Coach.

148
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,062
( growling )

149
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,534
But I'm much faster
without all this armor.

150
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,469
Better tighten
that strap, son.

151
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,039
All right, listen,

152
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,809
you see that guy, okay?

153
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,778
( growling )

154
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,513
When you catch the ball
he is gonna hit you

155
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,848
like you ain't never
been hit before.
I know him.

156
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,117
He's a sadistic
son of a bitch.

157
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,919
There's only one thing
you can do, Phil--

158
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,288
just stay as loose
as a goose, okay?

159
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,290
And then jump up.

160
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,125
Even if you think
you're in Bangkok

161
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,961
don't give him
the satisfaction,
all right?

162
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,297
Oui, mon colonel.

163
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,299
Shit.

164
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,668
On three.

165
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,770
Hut hut hut!

166
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,480
( grunts )

167
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,549
( moaning )

168
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,996
That's great, coach.
That's a great idea.

169
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,417
How are you feeling,
Hoss?

170
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,586
( boys chattering )

171
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,526
I don't know.
Strange.

172
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,896
Hey, I really tried

173
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,631
but I could not
get up.

174
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,134
Don't worry about it.
Listen, Lewis--

175
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,470
that bastard laid
a big-time hit on you.

176
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,376
Listen, I'll catch you
later, all right?

177
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,778
I'll come by and
take you for a ride.

178
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,449
A ride?
A ride?

179
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,221

180
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:54,360

188
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,191
Philippe's voice:
True to his word,
Cal collected me

189
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,228
a few nights later
with two girls in tow.

190
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,398
My date was called
Sue Ann.

191
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,800
Quit staring,
will you?

192
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,936
I'm very sorry,

193
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,104
but you are
so very beautiful

194
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,041
it is difficult
not to.

195
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,410
Are you really
from Paris?

196
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,713
Yes, really.

197
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,082
Bet you had
a lot of girls already.

198
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,818
Well, not lots,

199
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,221
but some, yes.

200
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,857
It's normal, no?

201
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,093
Not in Wallatoona,
it isn't.

202
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,595
Wallatoona?

203
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,031
Where is that?

204
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,702
South Carolina, silly.

205
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,207
South Carolina City?

206
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,743
You're weird.

207
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,350
Sue Ann:
No.

208
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,518
Hey hey hey,
easy, tenderfoot.

209
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,520
Come on now,

210
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,990
these here girls
don't know from Frenchin'.

211
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,029
I said no.

212
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,265
No.

213
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,838
I said no.

214
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,207
( distant dogs barking )

215
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,412
Hey hey.

216
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,886
Cheers.

217
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,288
Sue Ann said she wanted
to see me again.

218
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:07,092
No, that's
a big mistake, Hoss,
a big mistake.

219
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,495
You'd better
just save yourself
for the one and only.

220
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,864
Who is
the one and only?

221
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,166
She's the love
of your life, man.

222
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,502
She's out there somewhere
just waiting for you.

223
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,405
Don't blow it
by going steady
with some dame from SC.

224
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,243
Hell, Phil,

225
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,913
I reckon I must have
dated at least...

226
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,116
a hundred girls
since I've been here.

227
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,485
And how many
did you do it with?

228
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,188
Rule number one,
amigo--

229
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,190
good girls
don't do it.

230
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,426
And rule number two--
it don't count

231
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,428
if you don't do it
with a good girl.

232
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,998
You see, dog and pigs
don't count.

233
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,567
But what if you
want her too much?

234
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,969
What if you just can't
stand it anymore?

235
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,473
Well, then I guess you do
like everybody else--

236
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,044
make out
with your right hand
in the shower.

237
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,048
Yeah.

238
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,318
I believe Southern Bouquet
is probably about the best
soap for that.

239
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,754
See, it's nice and white
and it smells good.

240
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,156
And, hell, you can
pick it up anywhere.

241
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,360
What about whores?

242
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,963
Oh.

243
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,332
Danger, disease,
disgrace,

244
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,334
thrown out of frat,

245
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,170
heap big danger.

246
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,673
Come on, Phil,
me a Southern gentleman.

247
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,242
See, white whores
don't exist

248
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,579
and black whores
are off-limits.

249
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,581
Besides...

250
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,250
Besides what, Cal?

251
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,520
Well, there just ain't
no whores

252
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,589
in the Shenandoah Valley.

253
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,147
Philippe's voice:
One of my teachers,
Rex Jennings,

254
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,582
lived there
with his wife Doris.

255
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,584
He introduced me
to writers

256
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,187
like Raymond Chandler
and Salinger

257
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,656
whose books
I devoured.

258
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,580
( thud )

259
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,354
( creaking )

260
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,661
Doris?

261
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,407
Hi.

262
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,444
Hello.

263
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,747
I am terribly sorry.
I thought it was Doris.

264
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,749
You're foreign,
aren't you?

265
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,152
You're not
an ordinary student.

266
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,288
Is my accent that bad?

267
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,623
No.

268
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,232
I can tell by the fact
that you can look me
in the eyes.

269
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:37,069
American boys
can't seem to look
Negro girls in the eyes.

270
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,773
Do you want
some coffee?

271
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,476
Yes, please.

272
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,414
What's your name?

273
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,483
Philippe.

274
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,254
Philippe.

275
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,889
Philippe's voice:
Suddenly I realized
that I hadn't heard

276
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,558
my own name
in months.

277
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,860
I hadn't been Philippe
since I left Paris.

278
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,862
Careful.
It's hot.

279
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,331
You like this book?

280
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,333
I don't know.

281
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,737
I am only
on page two.

282
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,739
Have you read it?

283
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,308
Read it and taught it.
I don't just clean houses.

284
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,910
I'm a teacher.

285
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,912
- At college?
- No.

286
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:25,183
I teach elementary school
on the other side of town.

287
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,185
But now I have to go.

288
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,956
No, please,
five more minutes.

289
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,459
Non, Philippe,
ce n'est pas possible.

290
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,928
Vous parlez Francais?

291
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,930
Well, through the mail.

292
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,167
I took this
correspondence course.

293
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,303
But now I have to go.

294
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,739
No, stay
for just a moment.

295
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,877
Say my name again.

296
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,513
Please.

297
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,782
Why should I say
your name?

298
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,719
Because nobody calls me
by my real name.

299
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,955
And when you say it

300
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,059
it makes me feel
less lonely.

301
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,594
Are you lonely,

302
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,397
Philippe?

303
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,001
Sometimes.

304
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,037
Are you lonely now?

305
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,239
No.

306
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,453
What's your name?

307
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,655
April.

308
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,745
Hey, kid.

309
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,080
I'm glad
you're still here.

310
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:06,518
So how are you cottoning
to old JD there?

311
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,520
I am in love.

312
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,456
I know what you mean.
Wait till you get
to the part

313
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,325
where he dreams
of catching the boys.

314
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,061
No no, with a girl.

315
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,032
Oh, well,
that's great, kid.

316
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,068
Do I know her?

317
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,904
No, I don't think so.

318
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,739
I'm afraid
I have to go.

319
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,111
I have class at noon.

320
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,547
Well, take the book,
junior--

321
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,784
the least I can do.

322
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,786
Thank you.
You did a lot.

323
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,722
Careful now.
Don't let those
Southern belles

324
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,891
spin your head
around.

325
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,527
I won't.

326
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,765
( boys chattering )

327
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,204
- Hey, Frenchy.
- Hello.

328
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,240
Merci beaucoup.
( laughing )

329
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,609
( dance music playing )

330
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,782
Have you seen
Cal around?

331
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,617
Cal?
Cal who?

332
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,519
Please.
Cal Cate.

333
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,555
He's over there
watching TV.

334
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,898
Cal, can I borrow
your car?

335
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,900
Are you kidding me?

336
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,902
That's a big favor,
Greenhorn.

337
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,605
It needs a big trade.

338
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,741
You have a French exam
coming up, don't you?

339
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,144
- Can you
guarantee me an A?
- Of course.

340
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,646
- You got a license?
- I have everything--

341
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,182
a license, money,
insurance.

342
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,453
One scratch and I'll
pay you 1000 times.

343
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,790
Oh, Frenchy, Frenchy.

344
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,162
Boy, you are lying
when you're lying.

345
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,031
But if you want
I'll take you where
you need to go.

346
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,139
So, pard, is this
just a joy ride

347
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,141
or you actually want
to go someplace?

348
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,844
I want to go where
the black people live.

349
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,380
No shit!

350
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,382
Frenchy wants to go
to nigger town.

351
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,885
What did you do, boy,
go and get yourself
some whore?

352
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,887
She's not a whore.

353
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,322
Her name is April.

354
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,658
Look, just tell me
where it is and I'll walk.

355
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,127
Oh, okay, now he's gonna
walk in the nigger town.

356
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,596
Boy, they'll take
them straight razors

357
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,232
and cut your French ass
to ribbons.

358
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,334
No, me Southern
gentleman,

359
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,270
me keep his word.

360
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,971
But I don't have
to like it.

361
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,744
( people chattering )

362
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,615
( baby crying )

363
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,257
I don't suppose
we got an address
on this maid, huh?

364
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,927
April.

365
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,962
No.

366
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,468
She teaches school.

367
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,138
Not at this hour,
she don't.

368
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:22,314
I'll tell you what--
I know the Cates
rode with Lee.

369
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,816
If I had a couple of boys
like this on my team--

370
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:27,385
take conference
every year.

371
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,088
Why don't you
ask the coach?

372
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,357
Yeah, sure,
the day it rains beer.

373
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,593
Look, let's just get
the hell out of here,
all right?

374
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,895
No, please,

375
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,064
another five minutes.

376
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,035
All right,
you said she was
a school teacher, right?

377
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,804
Let's go to the church.

378
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,173
They'll know
where to find her.

379
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,208
( dogs barking )

380
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,257
Philippe's voice:
There are two hearts

381
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,393
that beat
in the body of America.

382
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,396
One is hidden
behind the other.

383
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,165
And once
I heard its cry,

384
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,368
nothing was ever
quite the same for me.

385
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,203
( people singing psalm )

386
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,938
All right, Hoss,
last chance.

387
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,973
Big Cal needs
his sleep.

Philippe,

396
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,086
Looking for you.

397
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,122
Children, I know
God is love,

398
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,525

How did you know
how to find me?

403
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,014
Inspiration.

404
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,484
Okay, Philippe,
what do you want?

405
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,020
I must see you again.

406
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,522
Otherwise I will die.

407
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,392
Well, we can't have
that now, can we?

408
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,495
No, my parents
will be very sad.

409
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,866
Give me one good reason
why I should see you.

410
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,335
Because...

411
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,106
I think sometimes
you must be lonely too.

412
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,244
And of course

413
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,646
I can give you
French lessons.

414
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,685
All right.

415
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,954
You be here
the day after tomorrow.

416
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,190
4:00.

417
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,370
Well, I got to say
one thing, Phil--

418
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,372
if you're gonna
risk your neck
for a colored girl,

419
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,174
it might as well
be her.

420
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,176
Isn't she beautiful?

421
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,512
Isn't she
the most beautiful girl
you've ever seen?

422
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,113
Sure she is, Hoss.

423
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,516
I mean, she's
really something.

424
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,819
And so are you,
so just be careful.

425
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,322
Why? Why is everybody
warning me?

426
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,224
Because we're
from the South.

427
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,627
What do you see
that's so bad?

428
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,362
Nothing.

429
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,364
I mean, hey, if she's
your one and only,

430
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,833
maybe God will
protect y'all.

431
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,835
But there's just
one thing, Phil,

432
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,837
and this is
real important--

433
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,339
hey, you don't
breathe a word

434
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,341
of this
affair of the heart
to anyone.

435
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,911
You understand?

436
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,613
Okay?
Or we're all dead.

437
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,116
Philippe's voice:
My favorite teacher
was a man

438
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,953
with the improbable name
of Zachariah Wilhelm Gilmore,

439
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,156
the Liberal Arts Dean
and the living legend.

440
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,158
During the war

441
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,160
he had worked
under Wild Bill Donovan,

442
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,162
the founder of the CIA,

443
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,164
and returned
to the Shenandoah Valley

444
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,701
with a chestful of medals
and his reputation made.

445
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:40,405
We called him Zach.

446
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:45,076
Now some poets,
ladies and gentlemen,

447
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:49,948
turn their lives
into their great poems.

448
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,751
Do any examples spring
to your eager minds?

449
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,023
The dreamy-eyed
Monsieur Leclerc?

450
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:05,230
Byron, sir?

451
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,199
Byron.
Byron!

452
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,602
He had to mention Byron,

453
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,504
the one man
who confounds us all.

454
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,074
But why don't we
mention Bulgakov,

455
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,576
who had to share
his mistress with Stalin

456
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,012
so he could write
the "Master and Margarita"

457
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:25,149
while locked
in a duel to the death
with morphine?

458
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,185
Or Harry Crosby

459
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,889
or Monsieur Rimbaud?

460
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,027
You mentioned
Harry Crosby, sir.

461
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,329
I'm not familiar
with that name.

462
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,099
Harry?

463
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,036
Crosby was a Brahmin,

464
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,706
a Boston Brahmin,
nephew of Pierpont Morgan

465
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,009
and a true decadent.

466
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,778
He lived
in your city, Philippe,

467
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:57,215
died in the arms
of his mistress,

468
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,118
the Fire Princess,

469
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:04,222
at the Hotel Des Artistes
in New York City,

470
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,224
a double suicide.

471
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,860
On the sole
of his left foot

472
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,862
they found a tattoo

473
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:14,632
of our Savior Jesus Christ
on the cross.

474
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:23,007
So if any of you feel

475
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,177
as if you are
a decadent,

476
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,980
as some of our young
Southern gentlemen

477
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,982
are wont to do,

478
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,651
feeling the weight
of their bloodlines,

479
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,654
you all have
a long way to go.

480
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,269
What are you still
doing here,

481
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,838
you dwarves,
you dreadful

482
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,941
onanistic
small-timers?

483
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,943
Can't you see
that I am walking

484
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,312
with the ghosts
of the great?

485
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,459
Philippe's voice:
French was the bridge

486
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,729
on which
April and I met.

487
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,965
In many ways she was
even more of an outsider
than me

488
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,502
because I could at least
go back to Paris,

489
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,504
but where was she
going to go

490
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,940
with her books,
her correspondence courses

491
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,275
and her dreams

492
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,879
except to a country
that hadn't yet been made

493
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,715
and is even today
far from finished?

494
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,254
Take aimer--

495
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,557
"to love."

496
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,193
Plus-que-parfait--

497
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,962
j'avais aimé.

498
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,798
I had loved?

499
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,667
Exactly.

500
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,545
And now for
the conditionnel passé.

501
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,918
J'aurais aimé.

502
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,320
I would have loved?

503
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,294
Oui.

504
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,730
J'aurais aimé Philippe,

505
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,032
but all we did
was study French.

506
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,435
What else
did you have in mind?

507
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,137
I don't know.

508
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,139
I'm very surprised
some Southern belle

509
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,875
hasn't thrown herself
into your arms.

510
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,877
They run from me.

511
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,280
You're meant to chase them.

512
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,749
I only want
to chase you.

513
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,386
So chase me.

514
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,303
( laughs )

515
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,239
What?
What?

516
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,675
Why are you laughing?

517
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,144
How long
have you been driving?

518
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,446
Since this afternoon.

519
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,281
Cal is playing
Clemson.

520
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,117
He won't be back
until tomorrow.

521
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,285
Cal?
The golden boy

522
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,654
you showed up with
the other night.

523
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,623
Golden boy?

524
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,995
I want to be with you,

525
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,197
ma petit prince.

526
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,565
Mon prince.

527
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,801
"Ma" is feminine,
"mon" is masculine.

528
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:40,438
Okay, mon prince,

529
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,341
this will be far enough.

530
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,784
When will I
see you again?

531
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,786
Never.

532
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,156
( both laugh )

533
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,591
How about Monday
same time?

534
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,562
D'accord.

536
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,874
( men chattering,
blues harmonica playing )

537
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,714
Who are those guys?

538
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,150
That's the blues
coming by.

539
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,621
April, sometimes
you lose me.

540
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,024
They're musicians.
They play the blues--

541
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,793
you know, devil music--
at the Jook.

542
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,095
What's the Jook?

543
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,365
The Jook is one place
a French boy should
never go.

544
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,367
You hear me?

545
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,369
You go home

546
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,239
and you keep yourself
safe for me till Monday.

547
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,922
Philippe's voice:
Devil music, Jook's,
the blues--

548
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,492
she might as well
have waved that red cape
in front of me.

549
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,595
I was at that
blissful age

550
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:14,131
where bad things
only happen to other people.

551
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,601
Mm, wow.

Baby, I just want
to show you something.

564
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,033
Hello.

565
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,035
Whoa whoa whoa.

566
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,037
Are you looking
for something, white boy?

567
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,706
Yes, I would like
to see the show.

568
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,309
( chuckles )
Wait right there.

569
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,311
Just wait
right there.

570
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,513
- I have money.
- Just wait.

571
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,187
What the fuck
do you want?

572
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,190
I am terribly sorry,
but I thought it might
be possible

573
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:49,160
to listen
to the music.

574
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,962
You ain't
from here, are you?

575
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,198
No, but I can pay.

576
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,200
I wouldn't let you
in this place

577
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,669

578
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,105
Hell, if something
happened to a white
boy like you,

579
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,441
I gots the sheriff's
all over my ass

580
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,210
and he shut me down.
You dig?

581
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,881
- Yes, I understand.
- White boy.

582
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,249
- Hey, boy.
- Uh-oh.

583
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,453
- Coming to
the coon show?
- Yes,

584
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,523
- Fucking college boy.
- I'm not a college boy.

585
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,493
I am French.

586
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,495
Hey, you ain't
going nowhere.

587
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,297
I'm not a redneck.

588
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,500
I am not
a Southern gentleman.
I am French.

589
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,204
Leave the goddamn
boy alone!

590
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,441
Are you French?

591
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:41,645
Yes, sir.
Paris.

592
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,980
Oh, yeah?
Paris, huh?

593
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:46,117
We've played Paris before.
The folks treated us
real nice.

594
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,853
I met this little
fine young thing
over there.

595
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,155
Her name was Edith,
you know.

596
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,591
Just a little
itty bitty thing,
but she could sing,

597
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,593
- couldn't she, Sonny?
- Yeah, man, yeah.

598
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,329
So tell me,
what does this thing
get up to?

599
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,531
Pardon?

600
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,933
How fast
does she go?

601
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,669
Oh, as fast
as you want to.

602
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,072
( both laugh )

603
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,074
This kid
is all right.

604
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,910
Yeah, you came
all the way from Paris
to see the show?

605
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,045
Yes, but they won't
let me in.

606
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,448
Oh, that's your
backwoods for you.

607
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,217
Yeah, see, now
if you was in Chicago
that wouldn't happen.

608
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,254
That's where we're from.
See, Chicago is
a wide open town

609
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,256
where everybody
digs the blues.

610
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,258
Man, these folks
have been down so long,

611
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,026
fear's their
daily bread.

612
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,629
But you-- you're
coming in with us.

613
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,931
Come on.
Come on.

614
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,966
Come on.

615
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,005
I thought I told you
to get!

616
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,275
This here kid--
with us.

617
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,978
Not in my joint,
he ain't.

618
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,014
Listen up,
motherfucker,

619
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,250
now it's one thing
I got to play in your
motherfucking joint

620
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,820
and look at your fat
fucking ugly face

621
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,822
all night long
while I know

622
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:02,059
that you are
ripping me off
at the gate,

623
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,961
but you see
this kid here?

624
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:08,699
This kid right here
is coming in with us.

625
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:12,636
And if anybody's got
a problem with that,

626
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,206
well, we can just
step on around
to the side--

627
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,808
you, me and my
little friend here--

628
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,178
and we can work this out
the Chicago way.

629
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,219
Come on, kid.

- Girl, you look
so cute tonight.
- Thank you.

00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,061
he had more than
a few beers in him.

709
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,864
Now what I'd like
to know is,

710
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,467
where do you reckon
that boy

711
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,103
got them beers
at this hour
of the night?

712
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:49,339
Sheriff McLain, may I
take this opportunity

713
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,608
to make a small
contribution

714
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,610
to your reelection
campaign?

715
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,145
( chuckles )

716
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,881
One-- you're going
to do yard work for me

717
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,883
till you pay off
this debt.

718
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,487
I usually pay my boys
50 cents an hour.

719
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,623
Two-- you're grounded.

720
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,095
I've been watching you
for quite a while

721
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,798
and I have come
to the conclusion

722
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,368
that there is
something wrong.

723
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:22,206
I do not know
what it is

724
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,541
and I do not intend
to find out.

725
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,479
Come closer.

726
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,616
Closer closer.

727
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,118
At two inches
I begin to see.

728
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,727
I'm going to say
something very simple

729
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,697
and very fundamental,
and it is this--

730
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,333
don't spoil it.

731
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,269
Don't spoil
your semester.

732
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:56,039
This is an interlude
of inestimable value.

733
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,775
What you are
experiencing here

734
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,711
is priceless.

735
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,181
Don't be the Hamlet
of the freshman dorm.

736
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:19,096
( distant train whistle
blowing )

737
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,443
( panting )

738
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,414
I'm grounded.

739
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,416
Cal won't lend me
his car anymore.

740
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,851
Sorry I'm late.

741
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,688
But if you're grounded,
what are you doing here?

742
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,690
I had to see you.

743
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,125
You did that for me?

744
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,127
Of course.

745
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,064

Why?

772
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,528
Why be sad

773
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,830
when this is
such a happy thing?

774
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,299
Because I'm gonna
lose you

775
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,435
to some belle,

776
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,837
some girl
with blonde hair.

777
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:23,440
Cherie,

778
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,376
I'm not interested
in those stupid girls.

779
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:30,013
And they are not
interested in me.

780
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:33,183
I only love you.

781
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:37,687
For you
I'll risk everything.

782
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,056
Can't you see that,

783
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,058
ma petite reine?

784
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,361
I'm your little queen?

785
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,429
Yes.

786
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,601
You're the queen
of my heart.

787
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,837
I'm going to take you
to Paris

788
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,839
where things
are different.

789
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,375
And we'll marry.

790
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,784
That's nonsense.
It's never gonna happen.

791
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,658
I like you.

792
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:18,195
You're different.

793
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:22,165
I like the way you talk

794
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,769
and you're gentle,
but it's all it is.

795
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,138
It's all it's ever
gonna be.

796
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,341
You and I come from
very different worlds.

797
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,545
No.

798
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:40,050
You and I-- we are
from the same world.

799
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:44,221
The wind blows
in our face the same way.

800
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,623
And the sun shines

801
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:50,327
in your face and in my face
the same way.

802
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,664
The rain
makes us both wet.

803
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,666
You are not from Mars

804
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,270
and I'm not from the moon.

805
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:04,441
Say my name in French.

806
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,443
Avril,

807
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,511
mon coeur.

808
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,903
Mr. Leclerc.

809
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,574
Mr. Leclerc.

810
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,578
Mr. Leclerc,
I have decided

811
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,381
for the sake of my garden
and for my own mental health

812
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,850
to find another
assignment for you

813
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,852
more in keeping
with your talents,

814
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,388
meager though
they might be.

815
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,461
( all chattering,
crowd cheering )

816
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,606
( groans )

817
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,577
My leg, man.
I can't-- I can't--

818
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,646
All right, come on.

819
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:27,190
Coach:
Straighten out.
Straighten out there.

820
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:30,126
Hi, Cal.
Great game.

821
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,230
Yeah, sure.

822
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,232
What's the matter
with your kicker?

823
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,069
The asshole tried
to kick the ball
out of the stadium.

824
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,805
Now he's got
a groin pull.

825
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,641
What's a groin pull?

826
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,043
It's exactly what
it sounds like, Phil.

827
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:50,347
It means he's out
for the season.

828
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:57,554
All right, look,

829
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,556
next week we got
our biggest game,

830
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,491
Alabama Tech, okay?

831
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,493
I mean, their defense
is good--

832
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,895
really good.
You hear me talking?

833
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,498
It means I can't get 'em
in the end zone,

834
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:13,002
it's gonna come down
to a field goal again.

835
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,004
We're gonna be trying out
kickers all week.

836
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,073
It's gonna be
a nightmare.

837
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,816
Oh, I see that Faulkner
is lecturing

838
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,885
at Washington and Lee.

839
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,887
- Are you interested?
- Absolutely.

840
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,423
Good.
I think you and--

841
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:39,162
I think you and Sue Ann
should cover that.

842
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,201
Philippe's voice:
The last time
I saw Sue Ann

843
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,537
she was
a slightly dizzy belle

844
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,073
who I tried to kiss
in the back of a car.

845
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:54,444
Now she had reincarnated
herself into a journalist.

846
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,713
But then again,
at that age

847
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,481
we tried on
personalities

848
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,017
like other people
try on clothes.

849
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,353
What are you reading?

850
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:46,783
"Absalom, Absalom!"

851
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,117
Ah, the son of David.

852
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,018
Faulkner.

853
00:59:49,018 --> 01:00:08,871
Look, this conversation
is pointless.

854
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:09,138
by a kind
of boredom

855
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:09,405
or embarrassed,
as if he was wondering

856
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:09,706
what in the world
he was doing

857
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:31,194
in front of
all these strangers.

858
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:31,227
He exuded the kind
of suave patience

859
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:31,494
He spoke
only for the front row

860
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:31,861
and I doubted
that most of them
even heard him.

861
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:32,228
But if Faulkner
wanted to whisper,

862
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:32,629
he'd earned that right
as far as I was concerned.

863
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:51,180
I'll never forget
that handsome face

864
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:51,514
his mouth moving
like a sinner

865
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:51,848
on his deathbed
confession.

866
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:52,048
I must admit
I'm getting
a little dizzy.

867
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:52,181
You'll forgive me.

868
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:52,782
He's--
he's so beautiful.

869
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:03,326
( laughing )

870
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:03,359
Sorry.

871
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:03,893
Sorry.

872
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:04,961
Look, the only reason
I gave my hand to that girl

873
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:25,948
is because she is sick.

874
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:34,957
She's in psychoanalysis.

875
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:35,291
On your couch?

876
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:35,625
April, I only love you.

877
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:35,925
I swear by all
that is sacred to me.

878
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:36,159
So you're telling me
my eyes are lying?

879
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:36,626
Your eyes are lying.

880
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:36,793
No, they're not.

881
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:36,826
I'll prove it to you.

882
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:04,554
Well, Hans, what do you think
about the quaint custom
of Thanksgiving?

883
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:04,787
Thank you, Joanne.
It's wonderful.

884
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:05,221
It's very nice.

885
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:05,421
Do you have anything
like it in Austria?

886
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:05,688
No no.
What is das?

887
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:05,755
Das is a yam.

888
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:09,192
How are your
parents, Cal?

889
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:18,234
They're fine, sir.

890
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:18,835
Philippe's voice:
You'd think that
of all people

891
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:19,135
Cal would have
a place to go,
but he didn't.

892
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,402
His parents
were alcoholics

893
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,304
which made him
kind of an orphan himself

894
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:24,407
and gave him
that edge of sadness

895
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,243
that made him
such a great guy.

896
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:30,279
Pardon?

897
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,182
Your parents.

898
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,184
You do have parents,
don't you, boy?

899
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:38,254
Philippe:
Yes, I do have parents.

900
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:24,367
And they are fine.
I just received a letter
from them

901
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:24,700
and also
from my brother.

902
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:25,334
He was a soldier
in the Indochine.

903
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:25,601
Indochina.

904
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,169
I was in Indochina.

905
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:26,402
It's a beautiful
country.

906
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:26,936
Very determined
people,

907
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:28,271
( door opens )

908
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:28,771
No, Dominic,
I don't have the magazine

909
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:41,417
and I don't know
where it is either.

910
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:41,617
Maybe you should use
your imagination tonight.

911
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:41,851
What for?

912
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:56,098
What for?

913
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:59,235
What's Dominic got to use
his imagination for?

914
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:03,072
Oh, April,
you are so cruel to me.

915
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:06,209
Here.

916
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:08,611
Happy Thanksgiving.

917
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:14,884
Oh, April.

918
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:58,794
Thank you, God.

919
01:04:58,794 --> 01:04:58,961
You ever had
pumpkin pie before?

920
01:04:58,961 --> 01:04:59,262
Did you make it?

921
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:07,303
No.

922
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:07,637
I'm devouring you.

923
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:07,937
It is you that I taste.

924
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:08,204
Your hands
have broken these eggs,

925
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:08,437
touched this flour
and puréed this--

926
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:08,471
this most interesting
vegetable.

927
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:09,071
And you came here
to see me.

928
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:09,171
Is it not incredibly
dangerous?

929
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:09,372
No.

930
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,340
It's Thanksgiving.

931
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,078
Forget it.

932
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,080
I'm still angry
with you.

933
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:22,418
Why?
Because of Sue Ann?

934
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,287
She is so stupid.

935
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,089
I always sleep
with her.

936
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:30,693
I mean,
when I'm with her

937
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:33,329
I go to sleep.

938
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,998
She is so boring.

939
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,000
Philippe, I have to
tell you something.

940
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:41,771
No no, please.

941
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:43,773
One kiss
for a poor orphan,

942
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:46,509
all alone
on Thanksgiving.

943
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:50,112
What's French
for "kiss"?

944
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,782
Bisou.
Un bisou.

945
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,116
That's French
for "kiss"?

946
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:58,220
Yes, un bisou
is a French kiss.

947
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:01,657
Well, maybe you'd better
give me one of those.

948
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,289
( Cal cheering )

949
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:45,401
( Cal cheering )

950
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,505
Hey, Phil.

951
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:52,174
Phil, let's go for a ride,
little buddy.

952
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,757
Where is everybody?

953
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:12,294
Oh, I forgot.

954
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:15,464
With mommy and daddy
for turkey.

955
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,569
Well, fuck all y'all!

956
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,308
'Cause I'm
a Southern belle.

957
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:28,744
As long as what?

958
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:31,247
As long as he keeps
winning games.

959
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,249
Thank you, sir.

960
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,352
You're welcome.
Cheers.

961
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,354
( shouting)
Yes, sir!

962
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,257
We're gonna beat
Alabama Tech, sir!

963
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,276
Hey, Phil...

964
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,614
where are you, buddy?

965
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,117
Where is everybody?

966
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,464
Hi, Philippe.

967
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:05,641
Did you have
a nice Thanksgiving?

968
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,010
Yes.

969
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:10,513
Yes.
And you?

970
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,982
Did you go back
to Wallatoona?

971
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:15,484
Wallatoona?

972
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,920
Yes, where you live.

973
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,523
Oh, sure.

974
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:27,396
It was grand-- grand.

975
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,369
Did you finish
"Catcher in the Rye"?

976
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:36,105
Yes.

977
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,507
I'm-- I'm gonna see you
this afternoon.

978
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,443
Philippe.
Philippe.

979
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:44,013
Are you afraid of me?

980
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,659
Philippe's voice:
If only it hadn't rained
that afternoon.

981
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:02,665
If only I hadn't
sheltered Sue Ann
with my coat.

982
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,668
If only, if only...

983
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,677
Jennings:
"The silhouette
of a moving cat

984
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,813
wavered across
the moonlight,

985
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,349
and turning my head
to watch it,

986
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,619
I saw that
I was not alone--

987
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:26,055
fifty feet away
a figure had emerged

988
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,990
from the shadow
of my neighbor's mansion

989
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:31,527
and was standing
with his hands
in his pockets

990
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,963
regarding
the silver pepper

991
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:36,899
of the stars.

992
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:39,201
Something in his
leisurely movements

993
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,071
and the secure position
of his feet upon the lawn

994
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:46,875
suggested that it was
Mr. Gatsby himself,

995
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:50,846
come out to determine
what share was his

996
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:54,450
of our local heavens."

997
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:58,087
We don't seem to be
holding your attention,
Mr. Cate.

998
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:04,460
Well, it's just a bunch
of Yankee talk to me.

999
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,929
Oh, it's just
a bunch of Yankee talk?

1000
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:09,765
What do you think,
Philippe?

1001
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,737
Pardon?

1002
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,339
You'll have to excuse
our French friend
today, sir.

1003
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,075
See, it's my
considered opinion

1004
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,011
that his mind is
on other things.

1005
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:27,082
Oh, all right.

1006
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,184
Let us move on
to matters

1007
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:32,354
less controversial
then, shall we?

1008
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,657
Something romantic?

1009
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,925
Romantic?

1010
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,297
Romantic.

1011
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,432
Ah, here we go.

1012
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,201
Lord Byron.

1013
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:49,471
Ooh, mad, bad
and dangerous to know.

1014
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,840
Yeah, you identify
with that, don't you, Cal?

1015
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:54,576
It's my family's
motto, sir.

1016
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,945
I'm sure it is.
Now...

1017
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:02,151
- this here poem...
- ( door slams )

1018
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:04,920
...is called
"When We Two Parted."

1019
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:10,159
Excuse me.

1020
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,261
You know
where it is by now.

1021
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:22,204
Does anybody have
anything else

1022
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,640
that they need to do
before we begin?

1023
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:29,111
No?
Good.

1024
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,113
This is a story

1025
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,115
of a passionate
love affair...

1026
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:36,552
- April.
- ...come to a painful
and premature end.

1027
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:52,801
"When we two parted

1028
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:55,604
In silence and tears,

1029
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:58,307
Half broken-hearted

1030
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,009
To sever for years,

1031
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,780
Pale grew thy cheek
and cold,

1032
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,316
Colder thy kiss;

1033
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:10,119
Truly that hour foretold

1034
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,121
Sorrow to this."

1035
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:15,057
Go away.

1036
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,059
"The dew of the morning

1037
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,728
Sunk chill on my brow--

1038
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,730
It felt like the warning

1039
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:25,000
Of what I feel now.

1040
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:28,370
Thy vows are all broken,

1041
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,973
And light is thy fame:

1042
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,409
I hear thy name spoken,

1043
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,811
And share in its shame."

1044
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,614
- Mrs. Jennings: April.
- Yes, ma'am.

1045
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:40,482
Where is
that green bowl?

1046
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,519
Jennings:
Honey, for crying out loud,
I'm trying to read here.

1047
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,754
Mrs. Jennings:
I'm sorry.

1048
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,292
"They name thee
before me,

1049
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:53,061
A knell
to mine ear;

1050
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,364
A shadow
comes o'er me--

1051
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:59,168
Why wert thou
so dear?

1052
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,603
They know not
I knew thee,

1053
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:04,506
Who knew thee
too well:

1054
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,776
Long, long
shall I rue thee,

1055
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,547
Too deeply to tell.

1056
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,550
Jennings and April:
In secret we met--

1057
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:18,554
In silence
I grieve,

1058
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:21,457
That thy heart
could forget,

1059
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,593
Thy spirit deceive.

1060
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,296
If I should
meet thee

1061
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,898
After long years,

1062
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,935
How should I
greet thee?

1063
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:36,238
With silence
and tears."

1064
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,753
You two
know each other?

1065
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,755
No, we don't.

1066
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:56,258
I need
that green bowl.

1067
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:07,169
Jennings:
Now this poem
was published in 1816--

1068
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:10,038
the same year
that Byron left England,
never to return.

1069
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:12,908
He was, as I'm sure
you recall,

1070
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,277
divorced
rather scandalously,

1071
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,646
so this was probably
a goodbye

1072
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,082
to some forbidden lover.

1073
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,553
Well, Phil,
all I can say is

1074
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:27,089
you missed
one hell of a poem.

1075
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,859
Philippe's voice:
I looked for my April,

1076
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,295
but she vanished
in December.

1077
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:36,298
She left her job
at the Jenningses

1078
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:39,735
and the Baptist minister
hadn't seen her either.

1079
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,308
Hey, bubi,
want to play?

1080
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,420
Good.
( muttering )

1081
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:07,696
Argh!

1082
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,798
Hans:
Good. Wunderbar.

1083
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,403
( all grunting )

1084
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,015
All right,
right here, Mr. Cate.

1085
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,084
Here you go.

1086
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:33,522
All right,
now go easy, Hoss.

1087
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:36,158
It's consistency
we're looking for.
Capisci?

1088
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:40,095
Great shot!

1089
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,566
Do it again.

1090
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,580
( growling )

1091
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:02,918
Hey! Hey!

1092
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,153
Hike.

1093
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,556
( grunts )

1094
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:15,130
Philippe.
Hey, Philippe.

1095
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:17,699
Run, boy, run!
Put some heat
under it.

1096
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,270
Let me ask you
a question--

1097
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:26,141
you think you can do that
with 11 assholes
from Alabama Tech

1098
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:28,143
looking to rip
your leg off?

1099
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:30,212
I can do it with my
left foot too.

1100
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:34,583
Okay, go get yourself
a number.

1101
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:36,885
Pardon?

1102
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:38,854
You just made
the team, Frenchy.

1103
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,289
Go on.
Go on.

1104
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,463
( cheering )

1105
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,666
Yeah, Frenchy,
you made the team!

1106
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:54,636
Anyway, listen,
this alumni says to me,

1107
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,872
he says, "Hey, Cal,
if you beat Alabama Tech

1108
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:59,174
you got yourself
a brand new Caddy...

1109
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,343
convertible."

1110
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:06,314
Hi, Cal.
Hi, Philippe.

1111
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:14,122
Hi, Sue Ann.

1112
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,200
There's a girl
to see you.

1113
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:28,036
She's downstairs.

1114
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,905
April.

1115
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:42,184
I came
to say goodbye.

1116
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,553
John Patrick Baldridge,

1117
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,688
Elizabeth's father.

1118
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,725
I told them
you were a Marquis.

1119
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:51,727
Elizabeth?

1120
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,729
Oh, monsieur,

1121
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:56,431
we're taking our daughter
back to Boston.

1122
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,533
Much to our surprise,
we find

1123
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,836
that she is
seriously ill.

1124
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:02,170
Ill?

1125
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:05,107
Oh, the unspeakable things
she's been reading.

1126
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:10,145
He has

1127
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:16,084
a black mistress.

1128
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,621
Mr. Baldridge:
As you see,
Monsieur le Marquis,

1129
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:22,891
she is really
very ill.

1130
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:26,194
Yes, I can see that.

1131
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:28,897
Mrs. Baldridge:
She is incapable
of meeting

1132
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,967
the challenges
awaiting her--

1133
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,336
challenges we have devoted
all of our love

1134
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,638
and experience
to prepare her for.

1135
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,074
Love?

1136
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,743
Mommy,

1137
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,746
did you say love?

1138
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,615
( laughing )
Love?

1139
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:50,318
Philippe's voice:
My God, her name was
Elizabeth, not Sue Ann--

1140
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:53,755
just another square peg
trying to fit into
a round hole

1141
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,492
till there was
nothing left of her
but splinters.

1142
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,831
Philippe:
Excuse me.

1143
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,635
I haven't seen her.

1144
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:08,970
I know, I know,

1145
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:11,039
but just the smallest
of messages...

1146
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:15,076
I can't do that.
Now I can only guess
at your relationship.

1147
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,078
Not only is it wrong
in the eyes of God,

1148
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:19,181
but, son,
it's dangerous.

1149
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,183
I know.

1150
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,185
Yes, you're right,
I'm sure,

1151
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,187
but if you could
just tell her

1152
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,522
that I'm playing against
Alabama Tech tomorrow.

1153
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,991
You?
Oh, dear Lord, help us.

1154
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:32,928
I'm just a kicker.
But please please,

1155
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,930
after this game
my semester is over

1156
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,899
and I have to go
back to Paris.

1157
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:43,772
Hey, son,
kick some 'Bama butt.

1158
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:50,345
( cheering )

1159
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:53,782
33 red on two.
One, two, ready?

1160
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,151
What the hell?

1161
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:58,153
He's calling
his own damn play!

1162
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,055
He's calling his own
play out there!

1163
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:01,122
( grunting )

1164
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:03,692
Cover me, cover me,
cover me.

1165
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,432
( crowd booing,
whistle blows )

1166
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:11,967
( players cheering )

1167
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,103
All right, you bunch
of candy asses,

1168
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,439
get your butts
over here and listen up.
And I mean now.

1169
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:19,507
Move it, move it.

1170
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,978
Boys, what do you
think's gonna happen

1171
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:25,914
if we don't win this
football game, huh?

1172
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:28,683
Nothing.

1173
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:33,088
Well, you'll be
disappointed,

1174
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:37,292
but then you'll go home
for Christmas.

1175
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:40,629
But for me
and my wife,

1176
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:42,631
my boy Cody

1177
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:45,500
and my little
Elizabeth--

1178
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:49,271
we're not gonna have
any Christmas.

1179
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,107
They're gonna fire
my ass.

1180
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,509
Yes, sir.

1181
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:57,212
So while you're

1182
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,547
around your
Christmas tree,

1183
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,349
opening your presents
with your family,

1184
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:03,351
I'm gonna be trying
to explain to Cody

1185
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:05,854
why he's not gonna
get that bicycle

1186
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,390
he's counted on
all year

1187
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,959
and why there's a sign
in our front yard

1188
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,961
that says "For Sale"

1189
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:16,231
instead of a snowman.

1190
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,233
Jane and I will be
packing up

1191
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,235
the last couple
of crates

1192
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,470
and my little girl's gonna
come down the stairs

1193
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:24,139
in her jammies
and she's gonna say to me,

1194
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:30,045
"Daddy, why do we
have to leave?

1195
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:32,080
Boys, I'm gonna
tell her the truth

1196
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,082
like I always do.

1197
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:36,084
I'm gonna say to her,
"Darling,

1198
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,653
there was a group
of young men,

1199
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:41,456
fine young men,
brave young men,

1200
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,826
talented young men
who when the chips
were down--

1201
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:47,996
they just threw in
the towel.

1202
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,932
And the shame is,

1203
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:53,468
they were good.

1204
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:55,470
I mean, they were
real good.

1205
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,539
They were this close
to being the very best,

1206
01:22:57,572 --> 01:23:00,175
but they threw in
the goddamn towel."

1207
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:13,355
Let's kill
the bastards!

1208
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:15,357
Philippe's voice:
Much later I learned

1209
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,326
that Coach Mallard was
and always had been

1210
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,328
a confirmed
bachelor.

1211
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,564
( band playing,
crowd cheering )

1212
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,910
Announcer:
And now they're coming back
for the second half.

1213
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:39,748
So let's hear it
for the ASU Rebels!

1214
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:53,028
Anybody lays a hand
on him,

1215
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,497
and you're gonna be
the new altar boy.
You understand me?

1216
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,365
Now you get out there
and you tear it up.

1217
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,566
Go go go!

1218
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:16,284
Announcer:
It's third down
and nine to go.

1219
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,319
Can they do it?

1220
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,091
Jack's open, coach.

1221
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,626
It's third down.
We're running it.

1222
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:26,561
Come on, coach.
It's wide open.

1223
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:29,164
I can get it there.
Just trust me.

1224
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,533
Okay, call your own
damn play.

1225
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:38,740
Philippe.
Hey, Frenchy, come here.

1226
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,742
How are you feeling,
Frenchy?

1227
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,577
- Fine.
- That's good.

1228
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:45,513
Down, set, hut!

1229
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:52,287
( whistle blows )

1230
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:57,258
Time out.
Time out.

1231
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,128
Kid, let's see
what you're made of.

1232
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:04,632
Announcer:
And with only
seconds to go,

1233
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,035
they're bringing on
their ace in the hole

1234
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:09,671
Philippe Leclerc
to try for the field goal.

1235
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:14,642
You got it.
Good luck.

1236
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,852
Save my ass, buddy.

1237
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,626
Time out.
Time out.

1238
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:33,628
( whistle blows,
players groaning )

1239
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:36,197
Player:
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

1240
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,902
Another time out?

1241
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,672
They want you
to think about it, Hoss.

1242
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:48,209
What's there
to think about?

1243
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:50,612
( players cheering )

1244
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:57,285
Long enough
for my man here
to take a shot.

1245
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:19,707
( rapid heartbeat )

1246
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:21,876
( whistle blows )
Base.

1247
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,315
Cal:
Hut hut!

1248
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:32,187
Frenchy!

1249
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:34,255
Throw the ball!

1250
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:37,892
Frenchy!

1251
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,896
Throw the ball!

1252
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,098
Frenchy, throw it,
throw it!

1253
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:45,867
Frenchy, throw the ball!

1254
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,136
Throw it, throw it!

1255
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:55,643
( cheering )

1256
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,745
( band playing )

1257
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,927
April!

1258
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,997
Put me down.

1259
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,004
Philippe's voice:
This time she was
truly gone.

1260
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,006
And at the end
of the day,

1261
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:27,108
it wasn't
because of Sue Ann

1262
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,477
or even the fact
that I was a student

1263
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,013
and she a maid, no.

1264
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:35,149
We'd been thrown together
for a brief moment

1265
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:37,719
two foreigners
traveling side by side

1266
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:39,721
through this great
and strange land

1267
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,956
called America.

1268
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:44,525
( dance music playing )

1269
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:46,794
But all I had to do
to be accepted

1270
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,230
was to win
a football game.

1271
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:53,301
For April it wasn't
quite that easy.

1272
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,303
Congratulations.

1273
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,639
You were exhilarating
out there today.

1274
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,641
I didn't know
you had it in you.

1275
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:01,743
You have ice water
in your veins, son,
ice water.

1276
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:03,745
Thank you.

1277
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:06,581
( girls giggling )
Come on, Cal.

1278
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,684
( Cal laughing )
Okay, hey, easy.
One at a time, girls.

1279
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:11,085
Cal.

1280
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,322
Hey, whoa, easy.

1281
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:19,761
Philippe:
Now, almost
40 years later,

1282
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,763
I've come to realize

1283
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:25,199
that youth is a gift
wasted on the young.

1284
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:27,835
I was too preoccupied
with my role

1285
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,772
as the Hamlet
of the freshman dorm

1286
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:34,075
to truly appreciate
the friends I made

1287
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:37,879
in that semester
in the Shenandoah Valley.

1288
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:40,581
Somehow I wasn't quite

1289
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:43,418
up to the grandeur
of Cal Cate,

1290
01:28:43,451 --> 01:28:45,920
the poetry
of Zach,

1291
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:48,489
the tragedy
of Sue Ann

1292
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:50,491
and, most of all,

1293
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:53,161
the passion
of April.

1294
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:56,464
And now,
like so many men

1295
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:59,701
who have taken more
than they have given,

1296
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:03,805
I find myself standing
on a mountain of glass,

1297
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:06,541
looking for the diamonds
I threw away.

1298
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:09,377
( train whistle blowing,
crossing bells dinging )

1299
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,446
( train chugging )

1300
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:18,920
Need a hand?

1301
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:19,954
Yes, please.

1302
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:30,631
No no, thank you.

1303
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:35,903
My daughter
made me promise
to give you this.

1304
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:55,256
April's voice:
"Philippe, mon amour,

1305
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:57,925
my love is yours always.

1306
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,961
