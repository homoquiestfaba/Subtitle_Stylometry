1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,909
Happy holidays.

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,270
Happy holidays!

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,749
Happy Hanukkah.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,315
- Hurry, Gladys.
- I'm coming.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,034
Wow. Cool trains.

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,428
Coming through. Excuse me.

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,790
Ooh... Ooh...

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,797
Waaaa-oh!

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,234
Hey, close the lid!
You're lettin' the heat out.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,590
- You're draggin' it.
- I got it.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,359
- You're draggin' it!
- I got it!

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,239
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,716
# 'Tis the season to be jolly...

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,034
Merry Christmas to you.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,755
Why, if I live to be 102,

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,192
I'll never forget the year
the Muppets almost missed Christmas.

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,197
An icy storm blew in, and...

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,630
Buddy, what are ya doin'?
We're trying to make a movie.

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,151
Why, I'm Joe Snow,
your affable, good-natured narrator.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,070
We don't have no snowman narrator.
Now get outta shot, ya Burl Ives wannabe.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,112
No snowman narrator?
That's a big mistake.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,038
I'm part of the holiday
collective consciousness.

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,392
I'll have my attorneys see you -
Frog, Slush and Snow Cohen!

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,637
# Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,671
# Jingle all the way

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,430
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh! Hey!

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,111
# Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way...

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,833
Gonzo, I sold my collection of rare cheese

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,317
to buy you this crystal Petri dish
for your mould collection.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,719
Gee, Rizzo, I sold my mould collection to
buy you a diamond-tipped cheese slicer.

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,592
Did you save the receipt?

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,029
# And making spirits bright

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,436
# What fun it is to ride
and sing a sleighing song tonight

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,838
Oh, Beakie, you sold your periodic table,
autographed by Stephen Hawking,

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,475
to buy me this stand
for my electron microscope?

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,476
Meep.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,675
Oh, but I sold my electron microscope to
buy you these rare mutagenic elements.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,552
But don't open it.

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,238
Oh...

40
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,311
# Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way...

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,512
Johnny, my best friend
in the whole wide world,

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,270
I sold my moped
to buy you this solid-gold record player.

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,277
Thanks, Sal.

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,678
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,920
# A-doopa-doop-bop doo-dow
Scoobetty-doop doo-doo-day...

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,632
Hey, there he is!

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,877
- Sing a song with me, baby.
- I don't feel like singing.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,471
He doesn't feel like singin' with you -
right, Kermit, my new best friend?

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,354
- Look, Kermie, mistletoe.
- Leave me alone.

50
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,836
- Oh, where's your holiday spirit?
- Piggy...

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,235
Just one Christmas kiss, hm?

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,353
Piggy, would you please leave me alone?!

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,437
Kermit, what's wrong?

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,554
Your gloomy behaviour would make us
wonder if something bad has happened.

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,558
We... we lost everything.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,513
Wow, I didn't know
you could read people like that.

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,235
It's a gift. Like my gold record player.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,672
I'm sorry I convinced you all to work
so hard and believe in this dream.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,631
It was all for nothing.

60
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,833
We lost the money, we lost the theatre...
We've lost everything.

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,428
But it'll work out all right, right?

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,873
I mean, we'll just all pull together
and everything'll be OK. Right?

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,513
Yeah.

64
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,835
Not this time.

65
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,518
Everybody! # Jingle bells, jingle bells...

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,633
Kermit, help me! I'm stuck.

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,070
I can't help you. I'll ruin your life.

68
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,717
Oh...

69
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,196
Brrr...

70
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,836
How could this happen?

71
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,315
Someone has got to do something!

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,317
Oh, dear.

73
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,116
Oh, Glenn... Hi.

74
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,715
Kermit the Frog has got a real problemo.

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,914
You'll wanna send someone down there
to dish out a little yuletide justice.

76
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,751
- Sorry, Dan, no can do.
- I prefer Daniel. This is a major crisis.

77
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,110
- Dan... Danny...
- Daniel.

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,756
We have strict guidelines that define
what is and isn't an emergency.

79
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,919
I can't dispatch a field agent
without a review from the subcommittee.

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,828
Come on, you know that.

81
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,838
Listen, Feliz Navidad, amigo.

82
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,191
Fine.

83
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,313
If you're not gonna do your job,
well, I'm gonna do it for you.

84
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,034
I'm taking Kermit's case to the Boss.

85
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,515
No, you're not.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,197
Whoa... Hey...

87
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,155
You're just gonna walk into the Boss's
office without an appointment?

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,636
That's the kind of attitude
that'll keep you in a cubicle!

89
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,876
I don't care.

90
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,593
Kermit deserves justice.

91
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,472
- He's goin' for it!
- No, he's not.

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,955
He's gonna do it. I bet he's gonna do it.

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,153
- Troublemaker.
- What's next, we're gonna wear colour?!

94
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,631
He's not gonna. Nope. Nope.

95
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,958
It's called fronting off.
The young folks told me about this.

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,875
He did it.

97
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,750
Career suicide.

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,916
Who dares disturb my peace?

99
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,435
Don't you love
the big voice? It's so scary.

100
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,198
Aargh!

101
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,313
- What? Too big?
- No.

102
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,795
A Jurassic butterfly.

103
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,710
Whoa, that's cool. You can really see
the beauty of the compound bug eye.

104
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,115
I think it's too big.

105
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,550
- Danny from Accounting, right?
- Yeah. Daniel.

106
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,513
- Daniel.
- Dani-el.

107
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,112
Well, Dani-el,
do we have an appointment?

108
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,233
No. But this is an emergency.
It's about Kermit the Frog.

109
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,272
I don't worry about him.
He always does the right thing.

110
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,870
Well, if you don't help him
he may never do the right thing again.

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,753
- What?
- Can you please just look at his case,

112
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,749
Your Honour... Your Excellency...
Your Bossiness?

113
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,838
I can't. I have this appointment
with the archangels.

114
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,078
We're talkin' about Armageddon,
tryin' to get Streisand for the post party...

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,671
You don't know how much this means
to me. I will never ask for anything again.

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,271
OK, look. If you convince me that Kermit
needs help, I'll send my best agent.

117
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,996
- Oh, thank you so much.
- But if you can’t convince me,

118
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,194
you'll have to transfer
all of my albums to MP3 files.

119
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,949
Well, you have, like,
every album ever recorded. Ever.

120
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,834
Yeah. Plus imports.
So you'd better be right about Kermit.

121
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,837
Have a seat.

122
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,112
- What channel?
- 8573296, and then press pound.

123
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,552
Which one is pound? The tick-tack-toe
thing or the squiggly bug thing?

124
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,717
- Tick-tack-toe.
- Agh. You do it.

125
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,998
OK.

126
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,473
- I should probably rewind it a little.
- Yeah.

127
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,391
And that's why I have this funny collar.

128
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,318
That's a great story, Kermit.
You're funny.

129
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,989
Kermit, I wanna talk about
your big holiday show that's coming up.

130
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,395
- Tell everybody about that.
- Happy to.

131
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,990
It's going to be a lot of fun,
and we could really use the support.

132
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,193
I love the Muppets,
so I for one will be there, front and centre,

133
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,108
at your Christmas Eve performance,
and I urge you all to come too.

134
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,196
Oh, thank you, Carson.

135
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,598
Ladies and gentlemen, get your tickets
now for the Muppet Christmas show.

136
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,280
- Thank you, Kermit.
- Thanks, everybody.

137
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,358
- That went well, Kermit.
- Yeah.

138
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,278
All that publicity
should sell a lot of tickets.

139
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,870
- Oh! I'd better go work on my act!
- That's true. I've seen it.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,996
Who is this little Carson Daly?
He is so now, so today! He's so cute!

141
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,035
- Excuse me, but who are you?
- Oh, bonjour. Je m'appelle Luc Fromage.

142
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,870
- But I am not stinky, like the cheese.
- No, no... It's a different sort of smell.

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,468
While you were out
doing promotional stuff,

144
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,559
I hired Luc to help with the musical
number. He worked with Cirque du Soleil.

145
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,274
- Just a little. Ua peu.
- And he speaks French.

146
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,312
I took your little
"Twelve Days of Christmas",

147
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,876
and I made them into this... this great...

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,514
- Vehicle.
- Yeah, vehicle... Whoo-whoo...

149
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,792
into the journey of the soul.
But not this soul. Or not this sole.

150
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,071
- The deep place. The deep soul.
- Very, very deep.

151
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,633
I can't wait to see it.

152
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,753
"Cirque Du So Lame"?
I don't think we want "lame" in the title.

153
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,671
It is not "lame". You are lame!
It is lamé, like this shiny fabric.

154
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,519
- OK, OK, lamé.
- Right.

155
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,108
Ua, deux, trois...

156
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,232
Let the magic begin!

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,037
Ooooo-ah!

158
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,193
Ha!

159
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,548
Ha! Ha!

160
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,915
Argh...

161
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,191
- It speaks to your essence, no?
- No!

162
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,357
- You're gonna love the five golden rings.
- The what?

163
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,994
Gonzo to Scooter.
Bring home the bacon. Over.

164
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,159
- Ten-four. Bacon down, bacon down.
- Roger. Bacon down.

165
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,909
Would you hurry up?
Don't make me miss my cue!

166
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,715
The ham is jammed.
Repeat: The ham is jammed.

167
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,989
Heave!

168
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,990
Argh! Aaaaarrghh!

169
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,356
I love the chaos!

170
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,916
I love the chaos! I love the chaos!

171
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,910
Ow, my nose.

172
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,433
Oh...

173
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,509
Yes! Yes! Bravo! Bravo!

174
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,269
- Luc, you're a genius! Bravo!
- Yes... Yes...

175
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,551
- So, what do you think, Kermit?
- Uh...

176
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,195
Well, it's not really what I was hoping for.

177
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,952
What?! Are you blind?
Are you blind in your little froggie eyes?!

178
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,152
Look, I appreciate
all the work you've put in.

179
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,990
It's just that our show is days away,
and I don't even know what this is.

180
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,318
This is a metaphor for the winter solstice
and the dark side of Christ-mas!

181
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,352
Pathos and the dark side of Christmas?

182
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,552
Luc, we want our show
to focus on the joy of Christmas.

183
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,194
You would - you're a little frog!

184
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,276
I quit!

185
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,995
Whoa.

186
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,318
Now what? That was our big opening
number. What'll we replace it with?

187
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,637
- We better think of something quick.
- Ha-ha!

188
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,992
I'll do my boomerang fish.
I throw them away...

189
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,634
and they come back to me.

190
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,911
Gee, Lew, I don't know.
It kinda lacks a Christmas theme.

191
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,508
OK. Rita, Murray, where are you?

192
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,677
- Who wants pizza?
- Pizza! Count me in!

193
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,272
Hey, Johnny, check out Rizzo's nose.
It's so shiny you could even say it glows.

194
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,234
Hey, Nose-tradamus,
can you predict the future with that thing?

195
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,117
- Knock it off, will ya? I got feelings too.
- Yeah. Just not in your nose!

196
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,756
Let's see... Shiny nose, laughing
and calling names... I've got it!

197
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,634
Meet the new star of the Christmas show,
Frosty the Snow Rat!

198
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,992
Gee, Gonzo, I thought you'd have gone
for Rizzo the Red-nosed Rat-deer.

199
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,759
Sure, if you wanna go for the obvious.

200
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,838
Ha-ha-ha!
This business is in business, OK.

201
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,318
I got the health permit, the fire permit,
the permit to operate a topless nightclub...

202
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,715
A permit for a topless nightclub?

203
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,513
- Better safe than sorry, OK.
- Good point.

204
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,995
Kermit, I will need a ticket to Miami, OK.

205
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,588
A ticket to Miami? Why?

206
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,632
Well, I've been invited
to shake my bonbons

207
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,309
at Ricky Martin's
South Beach Christmas party, OK?

208
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,479
Well, I don't know what to tell you, Pepe,
but we're flat broke.

209
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,271
Oh, hello? Hello, Muffins!

210
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,913
Hello?

211
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,909
Hi. Rachel Bitterman, new owner
of Bitterman Bank and Development.

212
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,554
Oh. Well, where's Mr. Bitterman?

213
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,238
Dead.

214
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,672
Dead? My goodness, I'm sorry.
Is there anything we can do for you?

215
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,030
Yes, as a matter of fact there is.

216
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,118
You can pay the considerable debt
you owe me, in full,

217
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,710
by midnight of the 24th,
or vacate this theatre.

218
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,229
But-but the 24th is Christmas Eve.

219
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,879
Yes. It also happens to be
the due date for payment on the theatre.

220
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,597
Funny how one day
can mean so many different things.

221
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,915
But we had a deal with Mr. Bitterman.

222
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,715
He said we could pay him
after the whole week of shows.

223
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,038
Yeah... Too bad
you don't have anything in writing.

224
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,435
Contracts. What are you gonna do?

225
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,439
But Christmas Eve -
that only gives us time to do one show.

226
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,630
And how is that my problem?

227
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,716
Oh! It isn't.

228
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,834
Ms. Bitterman, we've worked so hard.
Owning this theatre is our dream.

229
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,837
Working for a dream... That's beautiful.
My employees work for a salary.

230
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,838
Salaries? Is this like moneys?

231
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,112
Yes, pumpkin. And if you want to work
for moneys instead of stardust,

232
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,196
you just let me know.

233
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,156
OK. So, if you need boxes for the move,
check the back of the liquor store.

234
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,636
- We're gonna get you that money.
- Yeah, when pigs fly.

235
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,194
- Argh! Argh!
- Get the rope!

236
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,552
For the record, I consider that flying pig
to be a coincidence

237
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,716
and not a sign from God.

238
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,999
Ma'am? I want to work for moneys
instead of stardust, OK.

239
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,159
- You said to let you know.
- But what about our dream, Pepe?

240
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,071
Kermit, I must think of Ricky Martin
and his dream to salsa with Pepe.

241
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,156
And she's hot!

242
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,917
Welcome to Bitterman Bank
and Development!

243
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,076
- Gracias.
- Starbucks run?

244
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,476
Sí, sí. I like my coffee
like I like my women - al latte.

245
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,113
Oh.

246
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,754
Wow.

247
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,633
- See what I'm talkin' about?
- Yeah.

248
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,990
Cup of joe sounds good right now.

249
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,793
How do you have coffee in a bush?

250
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,036
Shrub. It's a shrub.

251
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,948
When you write the laws of the universe,
you know the loopholes.

252
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,753
Hence, I created a coffee shrub.

253
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,953
Anyway, I can't believe
what Bitterman did. It's so immoral.

254
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,991
It's just unfair.

255
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,954
Immoral, unfair... Why do you care
about Kermit's credit problems?

256
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,279
Just, please, keep watching.
I promise you'll wanna help Kermit.

257
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,233
All right, I'll keep watching.

258
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,875
You're just lucky SpoageBob isn't on.

259
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,958
- I love SpoageBob.
- Do I care?

260
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,949
- Christmas is ruined!
- What are we going to do?

261
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,799
It would take a miracle
to save the theatre!

262
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,036
Huh?

263
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,312
Oop, sorry.
Like, I was totally just tuning up my harp.

264
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,153
You know, guys, let's not assume
the worst. I mean, maybe we'll be OK.

265
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,273
- Me-me-me-me-me.
- Excuse me, Dr. Honeydew?

266
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,870
Could we raise enough money
with one show to pay Ms. Bitterman?

267
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,394
Let's work it out. Beaker, would you boot
up the old window operating system?

268
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,029
Now, if we let X
equal the value of our debt,

269
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,709
and Y the value of seating capacity,

270
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:32,428
it appears maximum attendance
will result in Y being greater than X.

271
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,788
Hm?

272
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,357
- Yes, Beaker?
- Me-me-mo-mo me-me-mind.

273
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,677
Yes, I think you have a beautiful mind too.

274
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,760
So we'll have enough money
to pay Bitterman?

275
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,552
Yes. Wait, no.

276
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,318
Uh, yes... No...

277
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,273
Beakie, do you have my wax pencil?

278
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,118
Oh, there it is.

279
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,870
- Yes, as long as we add 1,900 seats.
- But that's impossible.

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,072
- Or we don't pay anyone till New Year's.
- That's not so bad.

281
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,918
Of next year.

282
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,915
Beakie?

283
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,229
What it boils down to, everybody,
is we sort of have to defer our wages...

284
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,917
Huh?

285
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,112
...for a period of, um, about a year.

286
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,313
- How will I afford my Propecia?
- That's not a toupee?

287
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,194
I know it seems like
we've already given everything we can,

288
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,438
but if we don't give a little more,
we could lose the whole theatre.

289
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,278
Our home.

290
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,198
So what do you say?

291
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,918
Piggy? Where are you going?

292
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,673
Oh, Kermie,
I would love to stay and work for free,

293
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,954
but a Hollywood doctor show needs a star
who's in touch with today's urban youth.

294
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,959
And, well, naturally they called moi.

295
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,719
- Typical.
- I'm sorry.

296
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,308
All right, peeps, let's bounce.

297
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,274
Piggy! Piggy, we need a star
for our show too!

298
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,549
Piggy?

299
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,875
OK, fine.
We'll just do our show without her.

300
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,276
Without her?

301
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,312
I don't see how we can
do anything without Piggy.

302
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,034
- I'm sorry, guys...
- I hate to be materialistic,

303
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,675
but how are we supposed
to have Christmas with no money?

304
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,598
Me-me-me-me-me!

305
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,836
The words on my mug are right.

306
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,714
It is hard to soar with eagles
when you work with turkeys.

307
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,149
- Turkeys?!
- What's that supposed to mean?

308
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,032
Guys, guys!

309
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,076
Look at us, fighting and being selfish
when Kermit has done so much for us.

310
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,875
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

311
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,114
Fozzie's right. Kermit,
I defer my paycheck. Count me in.

312
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,038
- Thanks, Scooter.
- We're in.

313
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,435
- I'm in.
- I'm in too.

314
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,949
- I'm in.
- I'm really in.

315
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,313
All right! We'll show Ms. Bitterman! When
we pull together, we can do anything!

316
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,994
Even if we go broke doing it.

317
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,998
Uh, Gonzo? You're not helping.

318
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,792
Oh. Sorry.

319
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,476
This little fishie went to the market,
and this little fishie needs a kiss...

320
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,275
And this little fishie...
looks like my cousin Manolo.

321
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,198
- Pepe, I want you...
- Oh, I want you too, OK.

322
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,675
Do not... interrupt me.

323
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,316
I want you to tell me everything you know
about the Muppets' financial situation.

324
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,070
You tell me, Bitter-baby.
I gave you all the papers right there, OK.

325
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,997
- All the papers?
- Sí.

326
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,148
This is the only copy of the contract
between the Muppets and my bank?

327
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,477
Sí. I needed it to get all the permits, OK?

328
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,397
Ooh! Hey!

329
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,435
- Maybe you should go with French tips.
- Forget the nails!

330
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,596
- Listen, Peepee...
- Pepe.

331
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,711
Sorry.

332
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,719
Do they know you have
the only copy of the contract?

333
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,439
Well, I cannot answer this question until
we talk about my Christmas bonus, OK.

334
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,190
I love your spirit.
Listen to me, my little king prawn king.

335
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,668
You answer this question,
and I'll give you your Christmas bonus.

336
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,790
Then tell me.

337
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,232
Tell me.

338
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,237
Tell me.

339
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,158
No, they don't know I have it, OK.
Peel me, I'm yours!

340
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,349
Yes!

341
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,550
File this!

342
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,473
Rough and sexy, OK.

343
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,639
But, Bitter-buns, why are you so excited
about the Muppet Theatre anyways?

344
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,194
For heaven's sakes,
it's not about the theatre.

345
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,429
No, it's about real estate.
It's about making money, not losing it.

346
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,757
It's about something like this.

347
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,989
I call it Club Dot.

348
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,315
Ooh, nice!

349
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,071
- Does it come with action figures?
- No, it doesn't come with action figures!

350
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,351
It's a scale model of a trendy nightclub.

351
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,357
Oh, you're so brilliant.

352
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,032
But how will the peoples fit inside?
It's so tinys. I mean, really tinys.

353
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,390
Come, I'll show you.

354
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,196
I think your Club Dot
is going to need bigger doors, OK.

355
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,950
# This is not what I taught you
and it's really bad...

356
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,277
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

357
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,234
I don't know when I've seen
dancing so... wonderful.

358
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,828
- So how's it going, Howard?
- Oh, Kermit...

359
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,112
Things could not... mm-wah...
be... mm-wah... better, period.

360
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,392
Is it possible to give 110%? Because
that's what I'm getting from these girls.

361
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,637
- Well, great. Keep up the good work.
- OK, OK.

362
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,479
- Love that tushie.
- Ha-ha...

363
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,078
OK, you clodhoppers, let's go.

364
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,714
Five, six, seven, eight...

365
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,832
Raba-ba-bam, ra-ba-bam!

366
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,837
Drummer boy!

367
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,228
That was, uh... loud.

368
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,430
Everybody take five, huh?

369
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,994
Gee, seems like
it's still missing something.

370
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,635
I know! I'll do my boomerang fish. I...

371
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,354
Thank you, Lew, thank you. No, thanks.

372
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,391
Sorry, Gretchen.

373
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,909
Fozzie, what does the show need?

374
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,830
Maybe it needs someone who'll make
people feel they got their money's worth.

375
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,350
You know, somebody with star power.

376
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,552
I know, Uncle Kermit -
you should call your famous friends.

377
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,558
You're right, Robin. To the star phone!

378
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,309
Listen, we are all big fans.
I watch you every morning.

379
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,989
We were wondering
if you'd star in our Christmas show.

380
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,715
I planned on spending the holidays
with my loved ones.

381
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,308
Good golly, Miss Molly,
you are such a big star

382
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,908
it would be an honour
if you would be in our show.

383
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,112
Let me remind you about the last time
I worked with a frog.

384
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,950
We fell madly in love, so naturally
I have a key made to his apartment.

385
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,868
I break in and reorganise his closets
as a little favour.

386
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,468
And how am I rewarded for my trouble?

387
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,592
The frog stops calling me!
Remember that?

388
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,154
Hey, Madonna.
Want a free Muppet T-shirt?

389
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,670
Courtney, can you juggle?
Thanks, Mr. Connery.

390
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,075
I understand, Mr. Schwarzenegger.

391
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,509
Hello, Mr. Rogers?
Hello, Angelina.

392
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,870
Hi there, Britney.
Hello, Nicole.

393
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,118
Gee, I could sure do with a little
star power around here, Triumph.

394
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,392
- Is there any way you could help me out?
- Muppet movies are always the best.

395
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,796
- You mean that?
- For me to poop on!

396
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,356
Right, right. You got me again. Bye-bye.

397
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,836
Hey, guys, he's coming.

398
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,953
Sorry, everybody, no luck finding a star.

399
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,315
Just watch - the day after Christmas,
all these stars will be marked down 40% .

400
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,274
But don't give up, guys.
I'm sure someone will come through.

401
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,994
Someone like, um?

402
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,429
- I don't know, just somebody.
- Mm?

403
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,950
- You know, somebody will...
- Like?

404
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,553
- All right, all right, I'll go get her.
- Yes!

405
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,553
- Can't find a pulse.
- Quick, the paddles.

406
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,913
Clear!

407
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,350
- Nothing.
- All righty, let's call it.

408
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,597
Time of death: 8.27 am.

409
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,598
I... I think I'm feeling better!
The shockie things worked! I'm alive!

410
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,517
- No, you're dead.
- No, I'm alive!

411
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,552
- No, you're dead!
- I'm alive! It's a miracle!

412
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,830
Cut. Cut!

413
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,394
- What are you doing?
- It's called acting.

414
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,478
- You're an extra.
- You're supposed to be a dead body.

415
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,354
I didn't quit the legitimate theatre
to play some runt under a sheet!

416
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,951
I was thinking my character could date
JD, then become a nurse with attitude.

417
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,548
- You'd have to go.
- Guess again, puerca.

418
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,993
All right... Oh, I know.
I'll be the cute janitor. Yes, yes!

419
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,192
The cute janitor who works
her way up to head of hospital.

420
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,518
We'll just have to lose
Frankenstein over there.

421
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,108
- Excuse me... Pardon me...
- Kermie?

422
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,869
Piggy, our show really needs you.
We really need a star.

423
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,230
Would you please consider coming back?

424
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,629
Oh, Kermie, I'm afraid
I'm must-see TV now. Scrubs needs me.

425
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,149
- Yeah... Miss Piggy?
- Yes, Billy?

426
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,111
You're fired.

427
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,231
- What did he say?
- He said you're fired.

428
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,554
- Gone.
- Canned.

429
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,470
Fired?! You wouldn't know talent
if it hit you in the eye! And it's about to!

430
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,639
I'll take it from here. Sorry about that,
Mr. Lawrence. Piggy, let's go.

431
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,072
Fine. I quit! I'm a real theatre actress
anyhow, not some spoiled TV show-off.

432
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,794
- A little boost, guys?
- You got it.

433
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,153
Now, as your star I have some demands:
A fresh fruit plate, nothing frozen...

434
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,596
Ah, Pepe, my heart is hot, like a black car
left in the sun on a summer's day.

435
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,711
I must have you now!

436
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,989
Oh, Rachel.

437
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,109
Oh, Pepe!

438
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,559
Oh, Rachel.

439
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,954
Oh, Pepe...

440
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,469
- So, Rachel...
- Call me Ms. Bitterman.

441
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,956
- OK, Ms. Bitterman.
- I'm not exactly clear...

442
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,959
Another mans?!
I will curse him like a plankton, OK.

443
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,956
What will you do if the Muppets come up
with the money before the deadline?

444
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,548
Come, my sweet potato-brain.

445
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,399
The answer is here.

446
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,477
If the others are as stupid
as that back-stabbing shrimp,

447
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:03,233
they'll never notice that I've changed
the contract from midnight to 6pm.

448
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,031
Right. Changed the contract.

449
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,029
I don't get it.

450
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,630
Look, the old contract,
the deadline was midnight.

451
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,630
The new contract, the deadline is 6pm.
At 6.01, I foreclose on the Muppet Theatre,

452
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,399
gut it, and put up a trendy nightclub

453
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,436
where I can sell overpriced drinks
to pierced and tattooed rave monkeys.

454
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,516
"Rave monkeys"!

455
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,076
Come, Einstein, let's go decorate my tree.

456
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,272
Right. Decorate your tree!

457
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,639
And tomorrow
you can oil that chair for me.

458
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,069
Right. Oil your chair!

459
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,795
You know, not everything is an innuendo.

460
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,192
Innuendo!

461
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,551
What have I done? I must warn Kermit.

462
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,472
Aie...

463
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,119
- The Muppets.
- Uh-huh. Got it right here.

464
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,119
- Two tickets, please.
- Get on in here. OK, here you go.

465
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,515
Mr. Kermit! Mr. Kermit!

466
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,552
I have excellent news. We have sold
enough tickets to cover our debt.

467
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,956
Oh, good! Everybody, gather round.

468
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,153
Before we go out there, I just wanna
thank you all for sticking together.

469
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,592
Because of all your hard work, we've
made enough money to save the theatre!

470
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,988
Let's go out there and have
a great show, huh? Nice work, guys.

471
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,148
And, because I love you all like cousins
I no longer keep in touch with,

472
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,114
tonight I dedicate
my performance to vous.

473
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,993
- Give us a kiss for good luck, Kermie.
- Uh, well...

474
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,350
- 15 seconds to curtain.
- Show's starting!

475
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,392
I'll take a rain check, Piggy.
Thank you, Scooter.

476
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,830
- Scooter!
- Where you headed, sister?

477
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,349
Kermit, I must warn you, OK.
Oh, Dios mío...

478
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,153
Gee, shouldn't you be in Florida
with Ricky Martin?

479
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,035
No, no, no. Listen, because the words
I'm about to say are very important, OK.

480
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,116
- I'm listening.
- You're listening?

481
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,435
- I'm listening.
- Sure? This is very big.

482
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,551
Pepe, the show's about to start!

483
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,719
OK. First of all,
she cheats on me with another man.

484
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,673
- Oh, good grief.
- OK. And the doll house?

485
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,713
- It's not a doll house, it's a nightclub!
- Imagine that.

486
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,868
And Ms. Bitterman, while very sexy,
is dishonest. She changed the c...

487
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,108
Oh, boy. Let's see... Cue the intro!

488
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,357
- Boss? You are the intro.
- What? Oh, good grief!

489
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,075
Ladies and gentlemen, Kermit the Frog!

490
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,792
Ha-ha!

491
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,753
Thank you. Thank you very much.

492
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,438
Oh, boy.

493
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,712
Thank you very much, and welcome
to the Muppet Christmas show.

494
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,470
Now, at this time we'd like to ask you
to turn off all cellphones and pagers.

495
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,077
OK, thank you. Now...

496
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,996
Merry Christmas, everyone. It's showtime!

497
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,948
# There was a frog

498
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,595
# A very strange enchanted frog

499
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,959
# And he came to France,
where the ladies can-can dance

500
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,153
# To the Moulin Scrooge
where our story starts for you

501
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,630
Wait, Donner. Stop, Schnitzel.

502
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,593
Kermit...

503
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,639
Whoa!

504
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,596
My, my. It sure is a nice Christmas
here in Paris in the year 1900.

505
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,030
I'm sure I'll find the inspiration I need
to write about love

506
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,754
here in this fancy red windmill.

507
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,795
Oh. But first, I think I'll try
this funny green root beer.

508
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,038
Ooh... Ahh...

509
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,196
Hi. I'm the green fairy.

510
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,390
What are you doing in my drink?

511
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,909
The backstroke! Ahh!

512
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,717
And now, get ready for a magnificent,
opulent, stupendous, tremendous,

513
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,593
gargantuan, spectacular spectacular!

514
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,872
Get ready for... Moulin Scrooge!

515
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,752
Kermit... Kermit...

516
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,677
It's very important...

517
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,677
Unbelievable, OK.

518
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,630
When the beautiful Saltine, the sparkling
zirconia diamond, saw this stranger,

519
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,594
she knew what she wanted
for Christmas - and it was green.

520
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting the star of our show,

521
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,875
the beautiful, stunning, exotic,
voluptuous Saltine!

522
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,436
Bonsoir, mes amis.

523
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,318
Come and get me, boys.

524
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,878
# Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree

525
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,036
# For me

526
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,596
# I've been an awful good girl,
Santa baby

527
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,439
# And hurry down the chimney tonight

528
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,630
Let's pick it up a little.

529
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,397
# Come and trim my Christmas tree
with some decorations bought at Tiffany's

530
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,590
# I really do believe in you

531
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,029
# Let's see if you believe in me too

532
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,276
- Kermit, I...
- What?!

533
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,834
Aha... A doobie-doo...

534
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,272
# Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way

535
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,269
# When you come to the Moulin Scrooge,
you stay, you've gotta pay! Yeah!

536
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,193
Where have you come from?
This is my big number!

537
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,117
# So if you're feeling plucky

538
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,153
# Our chickens are just ducky
at the Moulin Scrooge

539
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,795
# It's Christmas every day
As long as you can pay

540
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,592
- # And d...
- Aaargh!

541
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,635
Stop singing different songs! I can't
remember which I'm supposed to sing!

542
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,715
Nnnnn...

543
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,435
Excuse me...
"Santa Baby", from "bee-doo-bee-doo".

544
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,869
Oh, yeah. Right.

545
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,869
# A-doo-bee-doo, Santa baby,
Forgot to mention one little thing

546
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,638
# A ring

547
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,157
# I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby

548
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,631
# So hurry down the chimney tonight

549
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,596
# Hurry down the chimney tonight

550
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,553
# Hurry... tonight

551
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,994
I'll be waiting up for you.

552
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,316
Thank you.

553
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,951
- There is one present you can give moi.
- What is it, beautiful Saltine?

554
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,913
Vous, Froggie. Vous.

555
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,270
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

556
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,992
Say wha'?!

557
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
- Boy, that went great.
- Kermit...

558
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,639
The theatre is in great danger, OK.

559
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,594
The contract says...
Aie, I'm exhausted, OK...

560
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,599
Kermie, what were your ten favourite
things about my performance?

561
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,430
- Well, it's hard to narrow it down to ten...
- Oh, Kermie... Try!

562
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,472
Start with number ten
and work backwards.

563
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,513
- Don't you have to change?
- Oh, my next number! Yes!

564
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,313
- I'm wonderful in that, too.
- Of course.

565
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,954
Now, Pepe, what is going on?

566
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,356
OK... You are listening?
Because this is very important, OK.

567
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,153
- Pepe, I'm listening.
- OK, OK.

568
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,751
You must get the moneys to Bitterman
by six o'clock, not midnight, OK.

569
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,711
Or we will be on the streets.

570
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,070
That's not what the contract says.

571
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,158
- Oh, mira, mira, look, look.
- What?

572
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,032
- You see?
- Wait a second...

573
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,038
She changed the contract, OK.

574
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,871
You see? You can see right here.
She's very very tricky, OK, Kermit.

575
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,958
- Wait a minute. That can't be.
- Oh, it does be.

576
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,878
And it's almost six o'clock, OK.

577
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,555
Kermit, unless we act fast,
Ms. Bitterman will take the theatre.

578
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,070
But the joke's on her,
cos we've got the money.

579
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,714
Yeah, and I'm gonna
take it to her right now.

580
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,753
Pastel M&Ms?! I said no pastel M&Ms!

581
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,192
Kermie, you said you'd treat me like a star
if I came back! How could you?!

582
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,958
But, Piggy, it's just...

583
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,196
Coming through.

584
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,829
- Kermit, six o'clock.
- I gotta get to the bank.

585
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,633
Maybe I should go to the bank for you.

586
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,832
But what about your monologue?
You've worked so hard on it.

587
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,916
This is more important.

588
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,316
And besides, it's kind of crazy here.

589
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,831
Sí, sí, sí. I will fill in for Fatsie, OK.
I am very funny. Wakka-wakka, OK.

590
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,110
- Ah! Not bad!
- Gracias.

591
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,437
Are you sure you're OK
missing your stand-up spot?

592
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,156
Kermit, you have done so much for us.
Let me do this for you.

593
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,474
OK, you got the job. But remember,
this is a very important job...

594
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,670
Kermit!

595
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,677
You can count on me.

596
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,268
- Fozzie?
- Yeah?

597
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,958
The money?

598
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,675
- Oh, right, the money. Yes, of course.
- Aie-aie-aie!

599
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,916
Hope that was the right thing to do.

600
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,271
- Where's Fozzie? He's on.
- This is me, OK.

601
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,674
Right...

602
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,869
Thank you, thank you. OK...

603
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,514
Wakka-wakka, OK.

604
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,918
What are Santa's
three favourite gardening tools, OK?

605
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,230
Hoe, hoe and hoe, OK.

606
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,876
Hoe, hoe and hoe.

607
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,552
Is what Santa says, OK. Gardening tools!
Gardening tools! Hoe-hoe-hoe!

608
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,478
Hey, the shrimp's floundering!

609
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,238
You shut up, OK.

610
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,273
- He told us to clam up!
- What's he wanna do, mussel us?

611
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,231
Don't get me steamed, OK.

612
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,797
- Steamed shrimp!
- Oh, pass the cocktail sauce!

613
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,388
That's it! I'm coming up there!

614
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,479
- Oh, I'm shakin'!
- You're always shakin'.

615
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,795
I'm going to the bank. Gosh, I sure hope
they have a little bear's room there.

616
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,912
'Scuse me, mate.

617
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,319
Watch your step.
This street is teemin' with wild crocodiles.

618
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,433
- There aren't any crocodiles here.
- Are you tellin' me how to do my job?

619
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,791
No, no. But this is a city
and there aren't any swamps.

620
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,115
Crikey! You're a bear!

621
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,313
I'll have to tranquillise him, cos bears get
a tad cranky when they get a bit stressed.

622
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,350
Aargh!

623
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,198
Crikey! There he goes!

624
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,228
Hurry! He's gettin' away!

625
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,070
Watch out, folks! Stand back!

626
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,998
Come on, I think he went this way.

627
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,588
Watch out! There he goes.

628
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,431
What... Arghh!

629
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,872
He's right there.

630
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,313
These darts are really potent,
so I've gotta get a clean shot.

631
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,957
Meanwhile, everybody waited nervously
for Fozzie to get to the bank.

632
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,559
Argh...

633
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,912
What's happening? What's going on?
Everything is melding together...

634
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,591
- Crikey!
- I think I'm going to... I am.

635
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,875
Aaarghh!

636
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,797
There he goes!

637
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,470
What's this?

638
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,910
Ow! Ooh! Ow!

639
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,632
My eyes!

640
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,993
Where did he go? Where did he go?

641
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,350
Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho!

642
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,277
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

643
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,834
Oh, you poor thing! Are you OK?

644
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,915
Where's Bitterman Bank?
Bitterman Bank...

645
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,759
Look at you!
You're soaking wet and freezing.

646
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,348
Here, you take my coat.

647
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,077
Look, it's him! That green guy who stole
Christmas and ruined all our wishes!

648
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,634
I'm Nancy Nut-What from Whatville,
you see,

649
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,558
and you've made me and Uncle Nicki
quite angry.

650
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,035
He'll make sure
you don't steal Christmas again

651
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,355
by making you feel some serious pain.

652
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,835
Let's get him, and...

653
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,719
Uh...

654
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,560
- I can't rhyme. Can't we just beat him up?
- Yeah, let's go get that sick green pup!

655
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,238
Aarghh!

656
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,676
Agh! Ooh! Ow! Ow!

657
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,837
- Hey, that's a bear!
- A bear?!

658
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,799
Hey, where are you going?

659
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,637
Hey, anyone here
seen that guy that stole Christmas?

660
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,432
He went that way.

661
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,473
Get him! There he goes!
He's green, he's mean, and...

662
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,117
Hey!

663
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,718
Thank you.

664
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,037
Stop! Come back!

665
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,832
Arghh!

666
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,551
Hello. Hello.

667
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,996
Argh!

668
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,634
- Where's Ms. Bitterman's office?
- What?

669
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,389
Where's Ms. Bitterman's office?
I need to deposit this money.

670
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,197
Well, if I was a bear, I suppose I'd deposit
my honey in an old tree somewhere.

671
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,278
No, not honey. Money!

672
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,115
- What?
- Money!

673
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,949
I need to give Ms. Bitterman her money!

674
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,992
Oh. Ms. Bitterman's laundry.

675
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:38,069
Her offices are on the thirteenth floor.
I'll let her know you're coming.

676
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,873
- Thank you.
- Gesuadheit.

677
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,438
Where's the buttons? No buttons!

678
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,152
Ah!

679
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,748
Oh, what a beautiful nightclub!

680
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,832
What do you want?
What do you want?

681
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,077
What? No! Stop him.

682
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,753
No, not stockings! Stop... Do not...
Never mind.

683
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,316
Wha-ha-ha?!

684
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,230
Uh-oh.

685
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,919
Argh!

686
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,471
Aaarrghhh!

687
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,799
Ooh! Ow! Ooh! Argh! Argh! Oww!

688
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,196
Oh. Yes!

689
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,835
No-o-o!

690
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,232
Oh...

691
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,637
So, looks like the Christmas spirit...

692
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,070
is with the good guys for a change.

693
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,035
We know the truth about that contract!

694
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,871
- There's nothing in here.
- You mean nothing but a pile of cash!

695
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,355
Ahhh...

696
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,433
No-o-o!

697
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,833
Now, if you don't mind, if you could
take your sad self away from here?

698
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,599
You smell like a burnt couch.

699
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,909
Oh, no.

700
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,112
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no...

701
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,070
Yes!

702
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,435
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

703
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,389
Nog! Nog!

704
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,996
Oh, Rizzo. You did a great job.
Your nose was a real bright spot.

705
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,236
Yeah, lucky break.

706
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,277
And you guys have been
dancing together for a long time?

707
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,992
Yeah, yeah.

708
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,429
Wait. Hey, girls, come back.
My uncle used to own the theatre.

709
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,074
- Hey, Scooter?
- Yeah, boss?

710
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,556
- Have you seen Fozzie?
- No, not since he left.

711
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,111
Hm. I better go look for him.

712
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,310
And miss the party? He'll be fine.

713
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,353
You're probably right,
but I'd feel better if I knew for certain.

714
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,435
Fozzie? What happened?

715
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,909
- Please tell me you deposited the money.
- Oh, Kermit, I...

716
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,190
Oh, Fozzie, no!

717
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,440
Try it. Just put your tongue on it.

718
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,232
- Really?
- Just lick it.

719
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,635
- Sure it won't stick?
- Of course not.

720
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,512
- I dare ya.
- I double-dare ya.

721
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,518
- I triple-frog-dare ya.
- Oh... Hey...

722
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,790
Now you gotta do it.

723
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,673
See it? Look.

724
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,837
- Well, good luck with that.
- I'm stuck!

725
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,872
Guys, don't leave me! I'm stuck!

726
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,993
- Think, Fozzie, think.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

727
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,429
What happened after you left the theatre?

728
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,439
Well, first a crazy Australian
tried to shoot me with his blow gun.

729
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,714
Then people thought I stole Christmas,
then I got burned by a bunch of lasers.

730
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,833
Fozzie, there's no time for your stories!
Now, was it ever out of your hands?

731
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,154
No.

732
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,716
Oh, wait. Maybe for a second
when I bumped into Santa and his army.

733
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,868
Fozzie, if we don't find this money
we'll lose everything we've worked for!

734
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,116
Just keep looking.

735
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,397
Does it help that I feel really badly?

736
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,874
OK, so here are your holiday bonuses.
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas...

737
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,798
Kermit! Hey!

738
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:31,272
You gave me the greatest present of all -
your theatre!

739
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,915
- Ms. Bitterman, you changed the contract.
- You can't prove that.

740
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,828
I can't believe
you'd do this on Christmas Eve.

741
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,317
By now I thought
you would've realised I'm the bad guy.

742
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,356
Why can't you understand what this
theatre means to us? It's our dream.

743
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,277
Your dream?

744
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,313
Please! I mean, you can't eat a dream.

745
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,716
You can't sell watered-down drinks
from a dream.

746
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,311
You can't be the queen
of a Polynesian tribe in a dream.

747
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,715
Wait, yes, you can. Forget that last one.

748
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:12,392
The point is,
I believe in money, not dreams.

749
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,032
A life without dreams? That's terrible.

750
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,631
You just don't get it, do you?
Dreams ruin lives.

751
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,435
And in your case,
they ruined the lives of your friends too.

752
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,236
Hey, Kermit.

753
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,113
Don't let it spoil your holiday.

754
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,472
Remember, this is
the most wonderful time of the year.

755
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,755
# 'Tis the season to be jolly

756
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,919
# Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la...

757
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,716
This is not good at all. Somebody's gotta
do something about that Bittermouth.

758
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,516
That's what I've been trying to say. Look
what she's put this poor frog through.

759
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,679
I'm sorry I convinced you all
to work so hard and believe in this dream.

760
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,237
It was all for nothing! We lost
the money, we lost the theatre...

761
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,237
We've lost everything.

762
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,035
Send someone down there
to dole out some justice.

763
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:29,109
Uh, could you send someone down there
to dole out some justice? Please?

764
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,629
Let me think about it.

765
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,719
"Thank you, Kermit,
from the children of the world,

766
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,719
for the lovers, the dreamers, and you."
Dreams!

767
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:06,312
Bitterman's right. I ruined everyone's lives
with my ridiculous dreams.

768
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,234
You can't tell me
this is what you wanted to happen.

769
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,952
It isn't.

770
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:51,438
Hello, Fritz? We have a problem on earth.
Prepare the transport for a field agent.

771
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,996
Oh, great. Great.
Should I get Glenn on the horn?

772
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,955
No.

773
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,000
What... Me?

774
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,429
No. I'm the wrong guy.
I'm gonna go get Glenn.

775
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,595
Whoa! What...

776
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,109
What'd you do with my clothes?
My glasses?

777
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,312
I look like an ice-cream man
from Hello, Dolly!

778
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,193
What... what's this?

779
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,993
Regulatory Guide
to the Design and Implementation

780
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,999
of Divine Intervention on Earth?
I should tell you, I'm a very slow reader.

781
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,190
OK, fine.

782
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,552
Performing Miracles for Dummies.

783
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,478
I'm sorry, I'm the wrong guy for the job.

784
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,797
See, I'm a numbers guy.
People are too unpredictable.

785
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,674
Dani-el, you are the right guy.

786
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:49,750
You have a real understanding of right
and wrong, and an innate sense of justice.

787
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,193
You'll be fine. Now, get down there
before he turns into a frogsicle.

788
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,275
Go.

789
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:02,396
Aaaarrghhh...

790
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,272
...aaaaarrrghhhh!

791
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,190
Kermit! Oh...

792
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,118
Oh, dear, Boss! I'm too late!

793
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,313
See? I've already blown my mission!

794
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,313
Argh! Come on, Kermit.
Hang in there, buddy.

795
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,151
Argh!

796
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,193
- Why are you breathing on me?!
- You're alive! Now I can save you!

797
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,437
Do me a favour and don't bother.
Nobody can save me.

798
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,790
I think I can. You see, my name is Daniel

799
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,673
and I've been sent from above
in the name of justice

800
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,315
to right a wrong
and help you get the theatre back.

801
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,637
You? You look like
an ice-cream man from Hello, Dolly!

802
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,796
Well, normally I'm an accountant.

803
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,038
And normally I'd love to sit and listen,
but I've got things on my mind. Goodbye.

804
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,755
You don't understand.
I know Bitterman changed the contract.

805
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,998
How do you know that? Wait, you don't
run a Muppet Internet fan site, do you?

806
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,918
No, no. I'm a friend, and I'm here to help.

807
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,510
- I'm sure we can come up with a plan.
- Sure. Whatever.

808
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,312
What would the Boss do?

809
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,910
Hey, we'll call the press!
Alert the media. Start a frenzy.

810
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,318
No way, pal. Bitterman owns the paper,
the TV stations and most of the Internet.

811
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,991
- How can one person own so much?
- Corporate synergy. It's out of control.

812
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,714
Now could you please
just leave me alone?

813
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,994
Actually, I'm not allowed to. Besides, you
should not be alone. You're not yourself.

814
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,351
Kermit the Frog
would not walk out on his friends.

815
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,268
Walk out?! What do you know about
my friends? I'll tell you what I know!

816
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,868
My friends will be better off without me!

817
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,594
- What? That is not true.
- It is true! It is true!

818
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,396
I've ruined their lives
and I wish I'd never been born!

819
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,509
No...

820
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,473
You did not just say that.
You did not just say that!

821
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,512
I did just say it.
I said "I wish I'd never been born!"

822
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,235
- What am I supposed to do now?!
- I wish I'd never been born!

823
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,797
There, I said it again.
I wish I'd never been B-O-R-N, born!

824
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,832
Chapter 12, paragraph two.

825
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,238
"If the subject tells the field agent
that he wished he'd never been born..."

826
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,918
Psst. Come close.

827
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,393
I wish I'd never been born!

828
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,830
"...the field agent
must adjust the world accordingly."

829
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,239
Do whatever you like, because - did
I mention? - I wish I'd never been born!

830
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,476
OK. Calm down, Daniel.

831
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,388
I wish I'd never been born.
I wish I'd never been born.

832
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,671
- What are you doing?
- I saw this in a training video once.

833
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,915
What?

834
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,390
Welcome to the world
in which you were never born.

835
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,238
How did...

836
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,395
Argh!

837
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,991
Not ready is he.
There is no try, only do.

838
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,680
Oops. Wrong world.

839
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,631
Dan, how did you...

840
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,318
Oh! What's the matter with you?

841
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,878
Sorry, I had to do that.
I'm just following procedure.

842
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,389
Bitterman Plaza is now closing.

843
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:11,719
Welcome to the other world.
The world in which you were never born.

844
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,870
What happened to the park?

845
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,434
Ms. Bitterman bulldozed it
and built this mall.

846
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,233
But how did... What did...

847
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,510
Are you some kind of magician?

848
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,632
No. But I am a part-time
balloon-animal artist.

849
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,514
You see, I take the balloons,
and you twist them into di...

850
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,835
I have no time for that now.

851
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,679
This is a serious mission.

852
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,236
I will guide you through a mysterious
world. The journey will shock you...

853
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,794
Hey... Hey!

854
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,596
Leave me alone! I'm goin' home
to pack and say goodbye to my friends.

855
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,790
The joke's over!

856
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,392
Number one, you don't have a home.

857
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,071
Number two, you don't have any friends,
because you haven't been born.

858
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,749
And number three, I don't joke.
I've been told I'm not funny.

859
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,111
Oh, really? That gag
with the snow in my face was hilarious.

860
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,151
Gonzo?

861
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,952
I'm new at this.

862
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,992
Oh, sir? Sir, if you could
just spare a second.

863
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,556
I'm Gonzo,
and this is Amy the Dancing Brick.

864
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,513
Gonzo! Thank goodness.
Why aren't you at the party?

865
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,598
Look, buddy, I'm trying to work here.
Great!

866
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,030
That was my only customer today.
Thanks a lot! Thank you.

867
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,276
- Kermit...
- Why don't you just run along?

868
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,755
I don't get it. Gonzo?

869
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,874
Sorry, Amy.

870
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,037
I don't understand.
Gonzo acted like he didn't know me.

871
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,436
Because that was the Gonzo
from the Kermit-less world.

872
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,075
- Hey, isn't that your friend Rizzo on TV?
- I'm afraid to look.

873
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,236
What? Rizzo on Fear Factor?

874
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,797
Dawn, next you have to face off
against a filthy, disease-ridden rat.

875
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,152
Ready? Aad if you pass this test,
you'll then have to eat the disgusting rat.

876
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,874
What?! That was not in my contract!

877
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,878
Three, two, one, go.

878
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,911
Aargh!

879
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,350
What a disgusting show.
How can NBC live with themselves?

880
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,359
It's worse than it seems.
Your not being born has altered the world

881
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,631
so 90% of network TV is reality shows.

882
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,512
Go ahead, eat the rat.

883
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,518
First bite's the hardest.
Tastes just like chicken.

884
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,189
Poor Rizzo. I can't watch this.
This is a nightmare.

885
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,550
You weren't there, so...

886
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,878
Hey, do you hear music?
Is that the band?!

887
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,072
OK, let me see my speech, Fluffy.

888
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,514
Wait a second - you guys
are the Mayhem Band, not Riverdancers!

889
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,997
Out of the way before you get stomped!
And why aren't you in the kitchen?

890
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,429
Shouldn't you be
on some No.2 plate special?

891
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,712
- What are you talking about?
- Over there, short-stack.

892
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,552
Doc Hopper's?

893
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,079
Oh...

894
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,032
Are you a dancer?

895
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,908
No... It can't be...

896
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,756
Oh, dear.

897
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,752
Oh, dear. I'm sorry, Kermit.

898
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,429
Kermit?

899
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,269
Yep. The Muppet Theatre.

900
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,353
Do you wanna see
how that turned out without you?

901
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,595
Oh, Dr. Honeydew! Please tell me
this is still the Muppet Theatre.

902
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,793
Muppet Theatre?
Can't you read, lizard? This is Dot.

903
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,477
Ugh!

904
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,318
Oh...

905
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,753
Oh, no...

906
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,839
It's a nightmare!

907
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,077
- Now do you believe you weren't born?
- I'm starting to.

908
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,760
Hey, Ms. Bitterman? Here ya go, dear.

909
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,996
- Oh, thank you, Johnny.
- All right.

910
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:43,911
Hey, boss, these two deadbeats stopped
buyin' drinks for the girls an hour ago.

911
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,429
- Is that true?
- We've been buying all night.

912
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,269
- Yeah, we're goin' broke!
- They're lyin'.

913
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,676
I think it's time for you two to hit the road.

914
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,189
Whoa...

915
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,952
- How about another?
- You better believe it!

916
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,078
Ms. Bitterman?
We're all out of mineral water.

917
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,954
Then find some empty bottles
and fill it with tap water!

918
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,513
But...

919
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,513
Not only have you ruined the Muppet
Theatre, you've ruined the Muppets!

920
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,757
Thank you. Customer feedback
is very important to us.

921
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,917
I will certainly consider your input.

922
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,316
Wait a second...
Beaker, you're all swollen!

923
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,196
Could we talk about this?

924
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,833
Aargh!

925
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,709
Meep-meep.

926
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:45,229
I managed to get my hand stamped. Lick
your hand and we'll try to get back in.

927
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,715
Are you guys OK?

928
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,315
There you go.

929
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,510
- Fozzie?
- Yeah?

930
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,108
You probably don't recognise me, do you?

931
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,195
No.

932
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,756
But this is Christmas Eve,
and it looks like you could use a hand.

933
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,876
- Your kindness means a lot right now.
- Yeah, well, always help a stranger.

934
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,911
Uh, bye.

935
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,876
Well, he's acting a little strange,

936
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,675
but it's good to know
Fozzie turned out basically OK.

937
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,190
Yeah - if being a pickpocket is OK.

938
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,634
He took my wallet! Unbelievable.

939
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,753
And you don't even have pockets -
even more unbelievable.

940
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,158
Yeah, but... how could things
be this bad without me?

941
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,354
I guess someone like you
makes a big difference in a lot of lives.

942
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,189
But... I'm just one frog.

943
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,035
You know what? I think
there's someone else you should see.

944
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,551
Piggy.

945
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,872
- She lives in this sty?
- Yeah.

946
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,275
Apartment 217.

947
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,391
Here. You'd better take these.

948
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,837
Who is it?

949
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,915
Um...

950
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,077
My name is Kermit. Kermit the Frog.

951
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,076
Who?

952
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,828
Someone you used to know.

953
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,431
Yes... Of course...
It's all coming back to me now.

954
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,199
Um... Wait right there.

955
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,593
Outta my way!

956
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,551
Sorry.

957
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,876
- Piggy?
- Korwin?

958
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,199
It's been so long since we met that...
Oh, you brought candy!

959
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,709
Let's see what's in here.

960
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,158
Oh, fruit centre... Nuts...

961
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,115
Piggy, uh, merry Christmas.

962
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,357
I can see you really like cats.

963
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,358
Doesn't everyone?

964
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,552
Make yourself comfortable.
Have a seat... somewhere.

965
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,591
Thank you.

966
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,474
You, uh... you look good.

967
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,431
So, what are you up to?

968
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,394
- Actually, I do quite a lot of acting.
- Really?

969
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,239
Of course, I do most of it from here now.

970
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,790
Your... your phone.

971
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,956
- All right, all right. Excuse me.
- Sure.

972
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,516
Hello, darling.
Miss Piggy knows the answers you seek.

973
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,792
You must be 18 or older.
2.99 a minute, local tolls may apply.

974
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,833
- Piggy, you're not Jamaican.
- Yeah, well, I'm not psychic either!

975
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,589
Now, as I was sayin'... Hello? Hello?

976
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,314
Oh, great! You just lost me a gig!

977
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:26,479
But, Piggy, that's not real acting.
That's deceiving people for money.

978
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,229
Oh, no. You're not a cop, are you?
If you are, you have to tell me.

979
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,316
No, no, I'm just a friend.

980
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,149
Look, what do you say you and I go out
for a nice Christmas dinner?

981
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:42,435
But what about my babies? I still have
to wrap Mr. Meow-Meow's present.

982
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,758
Besides, I look terrible.

983
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,079
Oh, Piggy, are you crazy?
You always look beautiful.

984
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:57,228
You've got more beauty and talent than
any supermodel or movie star I know.

985
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:03,629
It's true I once had dreams of going
to Hollywood and becoming a big star.

986
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,034
But... they were just dreams.

987
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,390
Silly dreams. Ha-ha...

988
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,596
Oh, Piggy...

989
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,439
- I think you should leave now.
- What?

990
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,438
- Big day tomorrow. Lots to do.
- Yeah, but...

991
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,439
Clean, decorate,
bake the Christmas cry... pie.

992
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,915
- What? I'm not pathetic!
- No.

993
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,270
I still have my phone acting.

994
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,951
It's just the kitties and I want you
to leave now! Leave! Did you hear me?

995
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,833
Scram! Vamoose! I said out!

996
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,554
- Piggy...
- Aiieeyah!

997
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,200
And take your chocolates too!

998
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,317
On second thought, I'll take these.

999
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,872
Daniel?

1000
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,153
Daniel?

1001
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,399
Daniel?

1002
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,675
Daniel? Daniel, where are you?!

1003
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,709
Daniel! Daniel, where are you?
I want my life back! Please!

1004
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,439
Daniel?

1005
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,150
# I feel so small and useless

1006
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,317
# Ambiguous and clueless

1007
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:43,560
# I just can't seem to get anything right

1008
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:50,836
# I feel so invisible tonight

1009
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,717
# All the plastic Santas

1010
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,877
# Doin' hula dances

1011
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,676
# Remind me that I don't belong

1012
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,956
# All the fake snow falling

1013
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,038
# And my friends not calling

1014
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:16,678
# Leave me nothing but this song

1015
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,713
# On the most miserable Christmas

1016
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,559
# Of my life

1017
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:30,472
# The most miserable, horrible,
obnoxious, intolerable Christmas...

1018
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,273
Hey, don't give up.
You just haven't found the right audience.

1019
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,678
I'm so tired of scrounging.

1020
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,475
I've had my chance.

1021
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,239
# If only I could go back

1022
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,511
# And take another crack
at all the things I've left undone

1023
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,631
# I'd do them right

1024
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:02,037
# If I had my friends and family
here tonight

1025
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,233
# I'd have the most wonderful Christmas

1026
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,590
# Of my life

1027
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,114
# Everyone matters

1028
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,348
# Everyone matters

1029
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,631
# Even the smallest of the smallest

1030
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,513
# Can make the biggest dreams come true

1031
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,518
- # Everyone matters
- # Everyone matters

1032
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,598
# For worse or for better

1033
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,996
# We can change the world around us

1034
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:35,556
# With everything we do

1035
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,949
# Even you

1036
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,393
# Even me

1037
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:48,313
# You and... me

1038
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,558
Yeah.

1039
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,194
Thanks, pal. What was your name?

1040
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,038
- Kermit.
- Kermit.

1041
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,799
- Well, have a great Christmas, Kermit.
- Thanks.

1042
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,037
I'll see you around the mall sometime.

1043
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,310
Right.

1044
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,795
So long, Gonzo. Merry Christmas.

1045
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,709
Kermit, I'm sorry
I couldn't help you save the theatre.

1046
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,274
I guess I wasn't much help at all.

1047
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,789
You know, the theatre's just a building.

1048
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:35,233
I just wanna get my life back. All I care
about is being with my friends again.

1049
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,873
What's wrong?

1050
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,312
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I don't know how to get your life back.

1051
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,672
What do you mean?! Are you saying
I'm stuck this way, here, like this?

1052
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,477
- You see, I've never done this before.
- There must be something in your book.

1053
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,273
It really doesn't go into a lot of detail.

1054
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,992
But-but...

1055
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:00,591
Oh, I wish I'd never said I wish I'd never
been born! I wish I'd never said that.

1056
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,711
How could I have said that?!

1057
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,391
I could've just said "You're having a bad
day", or "Things aren't going your way",

1058
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,512
but no, I had to say
"I wish I'd never been born"!

1059
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,437
How selfish!

1060
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,588
It's ridiculously selfish, and I'm stuck
in this reality along with all my friends!

1061
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,269
I don't believe this!
What a ridiculous thing to do!

1062
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,833
Yes...

1063
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,030
He can?

1064
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,878
That's great!

1065
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:27,955
Oh...

1066
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,116
Well, that's a little weird.

1067
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,595
OK. Thank you.

1068
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,472
Kermit... Kermit...

1069
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,398
- I can send you back.
- I appreciate your help, Daniel, but...

1070
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,478
- What? You can?
- Yeah.

1071
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,797
Well, that's terrific! That's great!

1072
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,639
But... it's a little strange.

1073
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,797
Whatever it takes. Just do it.
I'm ready. Just do it.

1074
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,672
OK.

1075
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,230
Aw...

1076
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,796
The park! It's back!

1077
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,596
I'm back! I've got spit in my eye, but
I don't even care! You did it, Daniel! Yeah!

1078
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:11,269
- I guess I did.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1079
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,960
Don't thank me.
Just go be with your friends.

1080
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,277
Right. I'll go be with my friends.

1081
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,597
Hey, Daniel,
is there anything I could do for you?

1082
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,439
As a matter of fact,
if you found my visit helpful

1083
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,109
you could tell my boss
by filling out this customer survey.

1084
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,435
It will really help at my next review.

1085
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,314
Daniel, you've done more
than you could ever know. Thanks.

1086
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,795
Aw, come here, you!

1087
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,708
Daniel...

1088
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,479
Daniel, not quite so tight,
not quite so tight.

1089
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,433
- Sorry.
- No, it's OK, really.

1090
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,596
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1091
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,678
- Uh, Kermit...
- Whoo-hoo!

1092
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,030
I'll mail it to you.

1093
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,438
Thank you, Daniel! Thank you!

1094
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,391
Whoopee!

1095
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,353
I'm back! Oh, this is great!

1096
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,436
Thank you, Daniel!

1097
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,759
Yahoo!

1098
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,715
Merry Christmas, everyone! I'm back!

1099
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,273
Huh?

1100
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,470
I'm back!

1101
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,149
I'm back! I'm back!
This is wonderful! Merry Christmas!

1102
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,515
Looks like somebody's been drinkin'
a little too much eggnog.

1103
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:27,715
The only thing I drank was a shot
of reality and a big glass of appreciation!

1104
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:35,390
An appreciation of everything,
from Gonzo's nose to Piggy's beauty!

1105
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,750
- Rowlf, it's really you!
- Hey, Kermit.

1106
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,678
Hey, Piggy, wow!
You still got that mistletoe?

1107
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,631
I'm not talking to vous.

1108
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:46,753
Aw, c'mon. You don't need mistletoe
when you're green.

1109
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:47,835
Argh!

1110
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,993
Yeah, he's drunk all right.
Kissin' a pig on the chops like that?

1111
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,792
Mmm-wah!

1112
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,318
Beauregard!

1113
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:02,877
Did you see that?! Did you see that?!
Kermie kissed me! He kissed me!

1114
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,560
All my dreams just came true... Argh!

1115
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,189
Don't worry,
my fall was cushioned by Kermit's love.

1116
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,471
I hope Kermit's love can fix my tuba.

1117
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,832
No problem, Eugene.
And merry Christmas, Eugene.

1118
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,551
Fozzie?

1119
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,437
Any second now
you'll remember how I let you down.

1120
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:35,078
I understand if you never wanna
speak to me again. I feel so useless.

1121
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:39,352
Are you kidding? Our friendship
is more important than any old theatre.

1122
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,152
- Really?
- Really.

1123
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,794
- Thank you, Kermit! Thank you!
- You bet.

1124
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,117
But why are you so happy?
We just lost everything.

1125
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:52,189
I'll tell you why. Because I realised that it's
not that horrible that we lost the theatre.

1126
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:56,279
- That's good, because we lost it.
- Yeah, but what really matters is...

1127
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,150
Money!

1128
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,634
That's right. I said money.

1129
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,036
Let's face it, frog, money talks.

1130
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,596
Let's hear what it has to say, shall we?

1131
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:16,556
Could everybody please pack up and get
out so Ms. Bitterman can gut this place!

1132
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,035
This theatre is not yours yet.

1133
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,388
Yeah!

1134
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,318
Yeah, so get out or I'll throw you out!

1135
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,193
Oh! This little piggy's feeling brave.

1136
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:31,075
And this little piggy's
going to kick your skinny banking butt!

1137
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:37,275
"Skinny." Thank you. It's too bad
I can't say the same for you, Miss Porky.

1138
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,315
- Porky?!
- Oh, here it comes!

1139
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,954
That does it! Hiii-yah!

1140
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,672
Ooh...

1141
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,393
Oh. You did not just do that.

1142
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,275
Nnnnnnnnn-aieyah!

1143
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,029
Oh, I see.

1144
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,555
So you want a piece of me?

1145
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,873
Go, Piggy! Go, Piggy, c'mon!

1146
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,754
I see you are very agile
for a plus-size pig.

1147
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,152
Oh, my goodness.

1148
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,078
And you will be very unattractive
with a plus-size lip.

1149
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,351
- I'll give you five bucks on the pig!
- Make that ten!

1150
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,399
Don't take that! Get her, Piggy!

1151
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,191
Ha-ha ha-ha-ha! Ow!

1152
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,311
Oh, that's not good.

1153
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,072
- Oh, my, oh, my...
- Uh... Uh...

1154
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,909
Everyone calm down.
Violence won't solve anything.

1155
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:59,637
She may take our theatre, but she can't
touch the Muppet Theatre in our hearts.

1156
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,911
That's fortunate.
I don't want the theatre in your hearts,

1157
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,838
I want the theatre that exists in reality.

1158
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,077
Now, if y'all wouldn't mind, clear out!

1159
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,118
Look, everyone, look.
I got some good news, OK.

1160
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,312
Unless you are a sexy banker lady -
then it sucks, OK.

1161
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,477
- Oh, I'm really worried. Peepee's...
- Pepe.

1162
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,910
Peepee's got some bad news.
What, are we out of toenail polish?

1163
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,393
No...

1164
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,036
I took the moneys you paid me and filed
for a special permit with the city, OK.

1165
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,153
The Muppet Theatre is now
an official historical landmark, OK.

1166
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,589
- Historical landmark?!
- Wow!

1167
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:41,076
- Historical landmark?
- So are we!

1168
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,317
The theatre can never
be torn down or changed.

1169
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:48,194
It will always remain the Muppet Theatre,
OK, no matter who owns it.

1170
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,595
That's great!

1171
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,349
Read it and weep, OK.

1172
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,678
Seriously. If you could weep,
we'd all appreciate seeing this, OK.

1173
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,314
Wow, Pepe. That was brave and selfless.

1174
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,873
Sí, sí, sí, it was.

1175
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,437
But when you can help friends
and get revenge on enemies,

1176
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,757
isn't that what Christmas is all about, OK?

1177
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:17,477
I can't believe this! How am I gonna
make money off this junky building now?!

1178
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,479
- This is the worst Christmas ever!
- Or is it the best Christmas ever?

1179
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,310
With an infusion of cash from you, we
could add seats to the balcony, advertise,

1180
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,991
and then put on some really spankin'
profitable shows. Ssss...

1181
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,838
No!

1182
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,552
No!

1183
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,511
I hate you Muffins!

1184
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,430
- Good Lord!
- No!

1185
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,273
No kidding, I was frightened.

1186
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,595
Out of my way!

1187
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,234
And a merry humbug to you, grumpy.

1188
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:54,354
Hey, we're all singin' carols outside
and it's snowin' and it's real pretty.

1189
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,995
- You wanna come?
- Yeah! Come on!

1190
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,119
Come on!

1191
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:05,279
# We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas

1192
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,632
# We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year

1193
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,275
# Good tidings we bring
To you and your kin

1194
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:18,997
# Good tidings for Christmas
and a happy New Year

1195
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,351
Heavens! This is our best year ever!

1196
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,994
Whoa! Merry Christmas!

1197
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,759
Someone up there is lookin' out for us.

1198
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,796
Amazing. I failed on my mission
to get justice for Kermit,

1199
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,388
yet everything managed to work out.

1200
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:49,709
Do you think maybe Kermit never needed
revenge or justice, or even the theatre?

1201
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,400
Yeah. But what did he need?

1202
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,556
- What do you think he needed?
- I asked you first.

1203
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,434
- Yes, but I'm the Boss.
- Yeah, but I don't know the answer.

1204
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,470
People just really need to know
what matters in life,

1205
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,876
and you opened Kermit's eyes
and showed him what he already had.

1206
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,116
People don't need my intervention.

1207
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,995
Then how come the Salvation Army
ended up with all the money,

1208
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,111
the Muppets kept the theatre,

1209
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,313
and Bitterman ended up
with nothing except her own greed?

1210
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,319
Dani-el, I work in mysterious ways.

1211
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,469
Well, on behalf of the Muppets, thank you.

1212
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,317
# Everyone matters

1213
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,034
# Everyone matters

1214
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:52,232
# Even the weakest of the meekest

1215
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,989
# Can change the course of history

1216
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,078
# Everyone matters

1217
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,351
# We're in this together

1218
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,392
# The world would be so different

1219
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,798
# If there never was a me

1220
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,434
# Even you

1221
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,840
# Even me

1222
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:26,071
# You and me

1223
01:24:28,444 --> 01:24:31,444
