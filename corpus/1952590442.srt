1
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,840
My name 's Ramona Q.

2
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm nine and three months, and no matter
what my sister Beezus tells you...

3
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,104
I'm not a pest.

4
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:59,707
My dad says I just have an overactive
imagination, which does come in handy.

5
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:03,754
It makes the fun parts funner
and the scary parts scarier.

6
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,154
And frankly, it's good
to scare yourself once in a while...

7
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,193
'cause if you can 't be brave at recess...

8
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:11,228
how can you do it when it really counts?

9
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,924
Okay, stay with me. You can do it, Ramona.

10
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,761
I ' never make it, Howie. Whoa.

11
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,772
Owie, owie.

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,675
That's my echo off the canyon,
canyon, canyon.

13
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:31,010
Don't psych yourself out, Ramona.
Just don't look down.

14
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,389
It's too far!

15
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:44,587
Far! Far! Far!

16
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:04,313
Howie, help!

17
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,748
- Mrs. Meacham?
-

18
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:10,413
Uh, Ramona 's kind of hung up.

19
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:16,150
- Help, please.
-

20
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,424
Quiet. Face front.

21
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,726
Ah! Help.

22
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,097
Eyes forward. Lock it down.

23
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:31,341
Ramona Quimby, get down from there.
This isn 't a circus.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,487
You should have seen it
through a window. It was awesome.

25
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,617
You looked like a pinata.
Well, obviously without all the candy.

26
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,253
It made me really dizzy,
yet I wanna do it again.

27
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:55,231
- Race you home, mudball.
-

28
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,203
- I won!
- See you tomorrow.

29
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,207
- Bye, Howie.
- Excuse me.

30
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:10,110
Ramona.

31
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:12,149
Be more careful with Willa Jean.

32
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,548
- Huh?
- She's younger than you are.

33
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,750
Willa Jean, come to Grammy.

34
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:41,245
Mom, took it. I taught Roberta
how to stick out her tongue.

35
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,372
That's great, sweetie.
Now I can cancel the private tutor.

36
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:48,078
Next, can you teach her
how to change her own diaper?

37
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,416
Could you set the table, please, Ramona?

38
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,286
And add another plate for Aunt Bea.
She's coming by later for dessert.

39
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,086
- So five altogether?
- Yep.

40
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,990
I was about to do that.

41
00:03:57,095 --> 00:04:00,553
Hmm. Being about to do it and doing it.

42
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:07,696
Mom! Beezus is acting all French again.

43
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,706
Dad's home!

44
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,481
Daddy!

45
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,084
Prepare for impact!

46
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:25,783
- Hi, honey!
- Dad!

47
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,951
Hey! How are my beautiful girls?
Mwah!

48
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,358
- Did you crunch the numbers, Dad?
- You bet I did, Pickle.

49
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,693
- I crunched them good. Real good.
-

50
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:35,527
- The whole darn day.
-

51
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:37,602
I don't think you got dirty enough today,
Ramona.

52
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:39,602
Well, there's always tomorrow.

53
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:41,672
- Mwah!
- I'll let you two catch up.

54
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:45,209
There's my little girl.
My little bowling ball with legs.

55
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,177
-
- Sorry about that, Icky Sticky.

56
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,182
Dad, it's Picky Picky.

57
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:56,653
- When are you ever gonna Learn
his real name?
- When he Learns mine.

58
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,748
So, Beezus, suppose I told you that when l
pulled up in front of the house tonight...

59
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:04,795
I saw your old buddy Henry staring at it Like
he Left something important inside.

60
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:07,160
Henry Huggins?
I haven 't heard that name in a while.

61
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,290
Isn't he the boy
that used to eat dirt in the backyard?

62
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,232
- Yeah.
- He doesn't do that anymore.

63
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:14,100
Ooh. If I didn't know better,
I'd say somebody has a crush.

64
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:17,072
- Ooh-ooh!
- Can we please talk about something else?

65
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:20,508
- Nope.
- There is that dance.
Maybe he wants to ask you to it.

66
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,672
Well, if he's gonna ask my girl to a dance,
he'd better have some moves.

67
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,841
Can the old dirt-eater do this?

68
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,943
Ooh-hoo, whoo-hoo!

69
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:31,249
Oh, I hope not. Stop.

70
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:32,880
Mom!

71
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:35,084
What do we got here? Note from the bank.

72
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:37,661
It could be Loan papers for the addition.

73
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:41,027
- Hope they don't expect us to pay it back.
- Well, banks are funny that way.

74
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,898
What do we got here?
"To the Parents of Beatrice Quimby."

75
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:47,699
Could this be the latest report card?

76
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,810
"Beatrice Quimby gets in fights...

77
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,402
"steals from the vending machines,
counterfeits hall passes.

78
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:58,243
- Wait. Let me see.
- We recommend juvenile prison."

79
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,614
We're so proud of you.

80
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:06,919
It's not funny.

81
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,792
So, Ramona, Beatrice has her report card.

82
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:17,163
Doesn't that mean-
I don't know- you should have one too?

83
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:19,736
That old thing?

84
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,638
Yeah, that old thing.
Where would that old thing happen to be?

85
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:40,617
- That's a good place for it.
- Yeah, wouldn't want it to spoil.

86
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,666
"Ramona is a bright young student"-

87
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:57,708
That's my girl. "... but Iacks focus...

88
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:00,642
"often daydreams,
disputes the need to spell words correctly...

89
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,942
"and has very little respect
for the rules of grammar...

90
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,017
or rules in general."

91
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,816
Why would she write this, Ramona?

92
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:17,656
Because... she's no fun.

93
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:21,323
- That is no excuse.
- But it's true.

94
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:25,529
She makes us all use
the same words from the same Iist.

95
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:29,801
And when I try to be original,
she just shoots me down.

96
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,376
Like when I invented the word "terrifical."

97
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:35,139
She goes, "Ramona, that's not a word."

98
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,874
And I say, "It's a Iot funner word to say."

99
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:40,348
She goes, "Funner isn't a word either."

100
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:42,511
What kind ofteacher is that?

101
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,384
She can't tell kids not to invent words.

102
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,890
She's not the president of the world.

103
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:51,086
You butt out, Beezus.

104
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:53,289
Ramona, Mrs. Meacham is your teacher.

105
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:55,992
- You need to Iisten to her.
- And she's not that bad.

106
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,695
She was fair with me when I was your age.

107
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,668
Yeah, well-

108
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,672
Everybody Ioves Beezus...

109
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,901
and everybody hates me!

110
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,271
Okay.

111
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:09,574
- Why are you Iaughing?
- We're not Iaughing, sweetie.

112
00:08:12,517 --> 00:08:14,485
I'm gonna say a bad word.

113
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,547
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:21,557
A really bad one.

115
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:25,595
Well, ifyou feel the need to get one
out ofyour system, then go ahead.

116
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,932
- Guts!
-

117
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:40,535
- Guts, guts, guts!
-

118
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,548
- "G" word.
- That's your idea of a bad word, Ramona?

119
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,494
Honey, I 'm sorry we Iaughed.

120
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,365
Hey.

121
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:29,121
What's she done?

122
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,092
guts!

123
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:43,474
Hey, babe. How's the air up there?

124
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:44,566
Hey, babe. How's the air up there?

125
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:46,667
Hi, Aunt Bea.

126
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,837
Aw, you can do better than that.

127
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:51,415
- Where's the Iove? Honk, honk.
-

128
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,843
I thought I'd find you here.

129
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:59,117
That was a fine job you did
on the toothpaste.

130
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,658
You must have a really strong grip.

131
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,659
Oh!

132
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:05,729
Let me see those calluses.

133
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,494
Oh, yeah.

134
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,866
that time on the jungle gym
sure is paying off.

135
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:16,702
Did that one get bigger?
Tremendous. Trophy size.

136
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,573
You know...

137
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:26,906
I was a younger sister, too, once. Still am.

138
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:30,146
No matter how old I get,
I' always be younger.

139
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,758
It's no fair, Aunt Bea.

140
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,725
I never do anything as good as Beezus.

141
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:43,865
- And Roberta, if she burps, it's adorable.
- Hmm.

142
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:47,267
Last week,
she poured applesauce on her head...

143
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:51,035
- and Dad stopped to take pictures.
- Oh!

144
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:55,977
I mean, when it's my turn to do stuff...

145
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,048
nobody even cares.

146
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,744
Well, it's impossible to compete
with pouring food on your head.

147
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:03,821
Why do we even bother?

148
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,754
You know what? I bet it would be nice...

149
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:09,383
to have something of your own for once.

150
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,792
Like my own room?

151
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:15,593
Maybe just something small...

152
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,668
you could always have with you.

153
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:23,465
Go ahead. Open it.

154
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:34,149
I found that picture the other day...

155
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:38,416
and I realized I was exactly your age,
so I wanted you to have it.

156
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,548
- That's you?
- Yeah.

157
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,150
There's room for another if you wanna
give that Iittle girl some company.

158
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:46,662
- Thank you, Aunt Bea.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,534
I want you to know...

160
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:54,298
that you will always have me around.

161
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:01,401
You okay?

162
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,003
I gotcha.

163
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:07,240
Mmm. I gotcha.

164
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:15,520
Bring it up!

165
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:17,560
Beezus, wake up!

166
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:19,823
Beezus, come on.

167
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,833
To the right.

168
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,945
Check it out, man.

169
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,181
Ramona!

170
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,447
Control tower, we 've reached 30, 000 feet.

171
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:23,391
Ramona, you are clear for airdrop.

172
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,585
- This is the best day ever!
- Whoo-hoo!

173
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,095
Yeah. I wish we had a hole in our house.

174
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:02,098
Hey, Ramona, Iet's make a deal.

175
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,226
If you can settle down for a few hours,
I' see if Dad can take us out to dinner.

176
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:07,736
Really?

177
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,239
Can we go to Macaroni Joe's?

178
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:12,536
There is an inch of dust
covering my whole kitchen.

179
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,770
- We can go anywhere.
- Yeah!

180
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,542
I'm having a hair crisis.

181
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,777
But it Iooks the same as always.

182
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,344
Thanks. Thanks a Iot.

183
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,050
He's home!

184
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,857
- Dad.
- Hey.

185
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:39,300
Daddy!

186
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,701
Boing!

187
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:43,933
Did you crunch the numbers, Dad?

188
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,737
Well, today they kind of
crunched me back.

189
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:50,269
But I got you a Iittle surprise.

190
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,616
Why don't you and Beez
go outside and share those...

191
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:57,415
and I' talk to your mom for a minute, okay?

192
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,752
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

193
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:16,298
Something's wrong.

194
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,568
They let three people go last week.

195
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,473
How can you tell?

196
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:22,443
Cause they're whispering.

197
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,616
Did I do something wrong?

198
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,116
No.

199
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,619
Not this time.

200
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,452
But something tells me
that we're not going to Macaroni Joe's.

201
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,059
Hey, you got more red ones.

202
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,192
right. Take a few more.

203
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:48,033
Remember how I taught you to eat them.

204
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:50,972
- Bite the head off first?
- Yep.

205
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,100
It's more humane that way.

206
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:57,042
You don't deserve to be downsized.

207
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:04,079
"Downsized"? What's that mean?

208
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,214
Well, um...

209
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:10,055
it means the storage company
was bought by a bigger one...

210
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:14,188
and a Iot of people were Iet go,
including Dad.

211
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,927
The good news is
I called Dr. Perry's office...

212
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:20,094
and she has some part-time work
for me again...

213
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:23,173
so that should tide us over
for a Iittle while, at Ieast.

214
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,673
Don't worry. I will find a job.

215
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,836
But in the meantime...

216
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,006
I got a Iittle extra time
to spend with my girls.

217
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,583
Right?

218
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:36,780
- Right?
- Right.

219
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,115
- Okay.
- Right.

220
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:43,422
You realize we're gonna be poor now, right?

221
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,791
No, we're not.

222
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,998
- Are we?
- Have you seen how many bills they get?

223
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:53,502
It's insane.
Everything costs money, even water.

224
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:56,266
Well, Mom's gonna make money.

225
00:16:56,374 --> 00:17:00,071
And Dad, he' be with us.

226
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:01,644
That part's fun.

227
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:04,476
Well, get ready for another year
in hand-me-down heaven.

228
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:07,551
Hey, Iights out, my Iovelies.

229
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,586
Sweet dreams.

230
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,265
Beezus?

231
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:27,830
It's sort of scary
having a hole in the house...

232
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:29,405
don't you think?

233
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,738
- Beezus.
- Shh. I'm trying to sleep.

234
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:37,706
Beezus, did you hear that growling?

235
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:40,978
It's probablyjust your stomach, doofus.

236
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:44,578
Unless...

237
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:49,123
Unless it's something...

238
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:50,454
else.

239
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:52,552
Beezus, stop it.

240
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:55,757
- Like a ferocious, hungry...
- Stop!

241
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,199
slithering beast that feeds
on pests with bad report cards.

242
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:04,665
You're too easy.

243
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:06,709
Beezus, it's not funny.

244
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:08,711
I thought it was.

245
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,280
Bring it up.

246
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,585
Let me get a pen, write it down.

247
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:17,620
- Both girls get carrots and sandwiches.
- Okay.

248
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,522
Beezus wants hers in a Ziploc,
and Ramona insists on having tin foil.

249
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,822
She claims it affects the taste, but I think
she just Iikes making sculptures with it.

250
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,456
What else? Ramona wants
a hard-boiled egg if we have any.

251
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,557
Think fast.

252
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:33,364
ease tell me you're
gonna remember all this.

253
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:35,803
Look at me, fully domesticated.

254
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,807
I've Iined up Mrs. Kemp
to watch Roberta at noon.

255
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,470
- you have to do is go nail this interview today.
- How do I Iook?

256
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:47,414
- I'd give you the job.
- Really?

257
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:48,883
I'd take it.

258
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:02,332
Ramona, did I ever
show you the proper way...

259
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,095
to crack a hard-boiled egg?

260
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,041
You are so weird.

261
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:27,085
A guy's gotta get his
protein somehow.

262
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:30,354
See, I got this stuff down.

263
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:41,162
Hey, Ramona, wait up!

264
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:43,968
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye-bye!

265
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:55,413
Nice doodles.

266
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,920
They're not doodles. They're sketches.

267
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:01,082
My dad's extremely sketchy.

268
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:03,319
Is everyone in their seats?

269
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,395
I'm about to round the corner.

270
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,396
And good morning.

271
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:11,935
I trust you all survived the weekend
with most of your Iimbs intact.

272
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,766
It's time we tackle our class reports.

273
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:16,999
Tell us about something
special in your life...

274
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:19,735
using at Ieast one word
from our vocabulary Iist.

275
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:23,736
This is my ballet tiara.

276
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:27,983
This is a saddle for riding camels.

277
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:31,077
It's special to me
because I'm going to wear my tiara...

278
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,419
when I audition for the part of the princess
in the Royal Peanut Butter commercials.

279
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,187
And it's special because
my Uncle Hobart gave it to me.

280
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:39,592
I think I'd be extraordinary in the role.

281
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,097
E-X-T-R-A-O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y.

282
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,463
And he travels all over the world...

283
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:47,435
taking pictures of animals
in their natural habitat.

284
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,699
H-A-B-I-T-A-T.

285
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:54,335
Extraordinary.
That's when you take something... ordinary...

286
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,204
and give it a Iittle extra.

287
00:20:58,315 --> 00:21:01,614
- So, does anybody wanna sit on it?
- Yeah!

288
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,211
- Okay, Ramona, Iet's hear it.
- Why, thank you, Mrs. Meacham..

289
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:21,571
Mute button. Mute button.
What am I doing? I'm muting you.

290
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:23,503
Ramona, go on.

291
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:26,770
Well, the most special thing in my Iife...

292
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:29,903
is that some nice workmen in blue helmets...

293
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:31,845
came to my house this week-

294
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:35,407
and chopped a great big hole in it.

295
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,052
But, But they did.

296
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:42,182
It was so big,
I could see all of Portland.

297
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:47,058
Howie knows.
Howie came and jumped through the hole.

298
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,430
He did.

299
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:53,002
That's enough now.

300
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,537
I think the hole's in her head.

301
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,539
- Show's over, Ramona.
- She's such a liar.

302
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:59,734
- Mrs. Meacham, I'm not Iying.
- Take your seat.

303
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:03,904
Go ahead. Take your seat. The purpose
of this exercise is not to entertain us.

304
00:22:04,014 --> 00:22:06,915
No embellishments, please.

305
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:09,451
Now, who would Iike to go next? Hands?

306
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:13,148
You saw them chop the hole in my house.

307
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:17,216
Actually, no. They pried it with crowbars.

308
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:20,354
Technically, they pried it.

309
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,489
That's what I meant.

310
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,659
Now Mrs. Meacham thinks I'm a Iiar...

311
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,635
and she's gonna tell my mom and dad
I'm a big troublemaker tonight.

312
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:29,638
Well, you are sometimes.

313
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,038
I mean, technically, you are.

314
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,610
Maybe you should technically Iook
for a new best friend.

315
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:38,113
Hey! How you doing there, chief?

316
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:40,080
Who's your girlfriend?

317
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:42,277
G- I'm not his girlfriend.

318
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:45,651
She's not my girlfriend.
She's Ramona, and she Iives over there.

319
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,849
Ramona.

320
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,197
Wait a second.

321
00:22:57,301 --> 00:22:59,394
Ramona Quimby? Huh.

322
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,233
Hey, I'm Hobart. I'm Howie's favorite uncle.

323
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,170
No? Oh. Sorry.

324
00:23:04,274 --> 00:23:07,766
Yeah. We all heard about it.

325
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:11,678
Oh, really? Well, how's that beautiful
Aunt Beatrice of yours doing?

326
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:15,843
You be sure to tell her I'd love to catch up,
all right?

327
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:20,921
Hey, Howie, how'd the saddle work out?

328
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,959
Did you get an "A"?

329
00:23:26,797 --> 00:23:31,632
Dad? Does Aunt Bea really know
some weird guy named Hobart?

330
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:35,193
Hobart? That's a name
I haven't heard in quite a while.

331
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:38,763
Yeah, they were high school sweethearts,
old Hobart and Bea.

332
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,043
Him? But he's not even her type.

333
00:23:43,147 --> 00:23:45,206
And what would that type be?

334
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:47,476
Perfect.

335
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:54,022
Oh, I'm afraid to Iook.
Bills, bills, bills.

336
00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:56,217
It never ends, Pickle.

337
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:58,317
Did you get the job today?

338
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,830
- Well, I didn't get this one.
- Oh.

339
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:06,400
'Cause I was thinking.
I've got the perfect job.

340
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:09,700
- What?
- You should be a fireman.

341
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:11,798
Oh. Yeah?

342
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,707
Yes. You would save people's Iives...

343
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:17,337
and climb gigantic Iadders.

344
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:19,712
And if it was a night alarm...

345
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:23,048
you would get to put your fire suit on
over your pajamas.

346
00:24:23,153 --> 00:24:26,748
- Whoa.
- It's true, Dad. I took a field trip.

347
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:29,189
Well, I wanna work in my pajamas...

348
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:33,252
but I think you're overestimating
my job skills a Iittle bit.

349
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:34,990
I'm not that versatile.

350
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,232
- Dad.
- What?

351
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:40,599
I think you can do anything. Don't you?

352
00:24:41,638 --> 00:24:43,333
Well...

353
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,873
Hi! I'm home!

354
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:47,739
We need to be there by 5:00, honey.

355
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:51,406
I've heard those parent-teacher meetings
can be really boring.

356
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:53,676
They make your brain numb,
they're that boring.

357
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:57,777
- Nice try, Ramona. We're going.
- Yeah. Good one, Pickle.

358
00:24:57,888 --> 00:25:00,584
Honey, I wanna call the bank tomorrow
and cancel the Ioan.

359
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:02,886
Bob, there's a gaping hole in the house.

360
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:05,257
I don't think we have much choice.

361
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:08,729
We 're in over our heads.
Let's wait till we 're on our feet.

362
00:25:08,832 --> 00:25:11,392
Beezus, what are they talking about?

363
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:13,595
We just have to finish it.

364
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:16,867
Hey. And if we default? I 'd rather sell it
than Iet the bank take the house.

365
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,841
Bank take the house. Bank take the house.

366
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,457
Our house.

367
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:09,685
- Can we just talk about this later, Bob?
- Okay, fine.

368
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:11,260
- We're Iate.
- Mom, wait.

369
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:15,229
No more stalling. We're meeting with
Mrs. Meacham, end of story.

370
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:16,993
- Hmm?
- Be good, Iovelies.

371
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,364
And be good for Aunt Bea tonight

372
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:21,460
We're off to numb our brains.

373
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,634
Beezus, where's the bank
gonna take our house?

374
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:29,109
It's just an expression, genius.
They don't take it anywhere.

375
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,613
They just sell it to someone else.

376
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,410
What?

377
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:35,007
I got it.

378
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:37,848
- Hello. Oh, hi, Henry.
- Beezus, we can't move.

379
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:40,253
This is our house. We belong here.

380
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:42,325
I... I don't want us
to Ieave ickitat Street.

381
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,394
Ramona, I am on the phone.

382
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,830
Aunt Bea!

383
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:55,302
- Can I- Can I ask you something?
- Shh. Just a minute, babe.

384
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:05,338
- What's wrong?
- I just thought, I recognized someone out there.

385
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:08,543
Oh. You mean Hobart. Hmm.

386
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:10,916
Sounds Iike you've met him.

387
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:12,921
He said he wants to catch up with you.

388
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,650
You're kidding.

389
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,555
He said that to you?

390
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,187
Well, that's just,
That's just classic.

391
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:30,762
Aunt Bea, can I ask you something?

392
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:33,104
I think the bank's
gonna take our house.

393
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,977
- Aunt Bea?
- Huh?

394
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,207
- Are you Iistening?
- Hmm?

395
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:41,443
Oh. I'm sorry.

396
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:44,486
I just-
How do I put this?

397
00:27:44,588 --> 00:27:48,354
- Um, you know those calluses on your hands?
- Yeah.

398
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:52,758
How the skin gets tough
to protect a spot that got hurt?

399
00:27:52,863 --> 00:27:56,128
I have one of those on my heart
from a really Iong time ago.

400
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:59,031
And if he thinks he can just come back here
and start picking at it...

401
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,036
he is sadly mistaken.

402
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,871
I guess you're the only one Ieft to talk to.

403
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,776
I'm sorry for pulling your tail
when I was Iittle...

404
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:14,544
and for trying to teach you
how to play catch...

405
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,915
and for dressing you up as an astronaut.

406
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,352
I know you're really old...

407
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,424
so I'm gonna say this gently.

408
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,823
We're in a Iot of trouble, Picky Picky.

409
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:25,861
We need money.

410
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:27,954
And we might Iose our house.

411
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:30,056
But don't worry, okay?

412
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,567
I'm gonna help.

413
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,570
Nobody thinks I can, but I can.

414
00:28:36,606 --> 00:28:38,665
I can be extraordinary.

415
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:42,142
I'm glad we agree.

416
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:04,499
Ramona, why is my desk on the Iawn?

417
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:06,569
It's a secret.

418
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:12,097
Okay, fine. I' tell you.
I'm saving the house for Mom and Dad.

419
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,042
Is that Great-Grandma's crystal?

420
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:17,045
Ramona, we never use that.

421
00:29:17,147 --> 00:29:20,116
I know. We're gonna make
so much money today, Beezus.

422
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,344
Now, if you wanna join the team...

423
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:25,979
I could always use
a hard-working sales associate.

424
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:31,218
Um, is that "delicious"?

425
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,393
Ooh! Customer!

426
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,990
Customer!

427
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:41,070
Ramona, please, please, please,
don't call him over-

428
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,605
Hey, Henry, you Iook thirsty!

429
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:45,607
- Hi.
- Hi, Henry.

430
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,474
Hey, Beezus.

431
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,842
Hi.

432
00:29:52,315 --> 00:29:55,580
- Selling Iemonade?
- Yeah. Just helping out my Iittle sister.

433
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,983
Like the uniform?

434
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,681
Well, the Iast time I saw you in pajamas...

435
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,725
we were playing sheep
in the Christmas pageant.

436
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:05,590
But, yeah, it's a good Iook for you.

437
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:09,324
Huh. Right. Yeah. Baa! Baa!

438
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:15,528
But I think you spilled something
on your shirt there.

439
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,836
- Oh.
- Gotcha.

440
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:26,843
Hello!
Delicious lemonade, anyone?

441
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,941
I... Yeah, I' have one.

442
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:30,519
- You will?
- Yeah.

443
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,783
Well, that' be one dollar, please.
Exact change preferred.

444
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,154
Oh, Ramona, Henry doesn't have to pay.

445
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:39,057
- Beezus, it's for the house.
- Uh, she meant "on the house."

446
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:40,925
No charge. Here.

447
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:43,056
- But, Beezus-
- Thank you.

448
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,100
Beezus!

449
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:47,363
Beezus!

450
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,769
- I said, shh.
- But, Beezus-

451
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,633
That won't taste-

452
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:54,073
good.

453
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:02,775
She's right.

454
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,945
No charge for that.

455
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:08,149
I wanna die! Just Iet me die!

456
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:10,123
I hate my life!

457
00:31:10,227 --> 00:31:13,219
- Beezus?
- No. Go away.

458
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,958
Get out. Get out.

459
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:19,627
But... what did I do that was so bad?

460
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:22,136
You embarrassed me in front of Henry.

461
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:25,504
If I didn't know better, I'd swear you were
actually trying to ruin my life.

462
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:29,272
You run around like a nutball.
You don 't care what anybody thinks.

463
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:32,576
And you even stuck me
with my stupid nickname.

464
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,673
But I was just a baby then...

465
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:36,775
and I meant to call you Beatrice.

466
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,913
It just came out... wrong.

467
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,548
Yeah, tell me about it.

468
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:45,958
How can I be normal with a name Iike Beezus?

469
00:31:47,631 --> 00:31:49,792
Who could ever Iove a girl named Beezus?

470
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:52,924
Jesus?

471
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:55,134
Get out!

472
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,472
Mrs. Pitt, would you care
for a car wash today?

473
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:06,446
My car is in the shop today, dearie.

474
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,643
- Wash your car?
- Just washed it myself.

475
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:11,152
ease Iet me wash your car, please!

476
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,615
Are you the pizza man?

477
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,953
No.

478
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:28,869
Hey, babe.

479
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:30,962
Hey.

480
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,974
How's business?

481
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,840
I'm considering retirement.

482
00:32:35,946 --> 00:32:40,406
Ramona's not a quitter.

483
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:47,752
Is he still out there?

484
00:32:47,857 --> 00:32:51,816
Doesn't he have anything better to do than
tinker with his precious Jeep?

485
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,657
Oh, Iook at him.

486
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:58,097
He thinks he can flash
those hazel eyes and that smug Iittle smile...

487
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:00,601
and just reel me back in again.

488
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:03,002
- Reel you back in?
- Yeah.

489
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,666
- Like a sea bass.
- Ew.

490
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,370
- I know. Exactly.
-

491
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,606
Here's what we do.

492
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:13,615
We head straight to the house...

493
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:15,878
Iooking confident and radiant...

494
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:19,444
so Hobart gets a good Iook at everything
he missed out on, okay?

495
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:21,786
- Okay.
- I'm so glad I wore my good jeans.

496
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:24,223
- Ready to strut?
- I think so.

497
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:27,387
- Hmm.
- But what if he tries to talk to us?

498
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:29,829
- We ignore him.
- Got it.

499
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:32,629
Strut and ignore

500
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,401
Keep up the good work.

501
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:44,604
- Excuse me.
- Oh!

502
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:50,079
Good, Bea. Real smooth.

503
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:52,154
How are you doing there, Beatrice?

504
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,124
- You got a Iittle-
- No.

505
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:59,127
You gotta watch out for that cross traffic,
Iadies. What's the rush?

506
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:01,254
We're ignoring you.

507
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:03,594
Now, why would you wanna do that?

508
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,261
So nobody gets reeled in Iike a sea bass.

509
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,998
Oh! Like the fish?

510
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:13,769
Huh. Well, we' make sure
that doesn't happen.

511
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:17,313
But it would be nice to find some time
to catch up with your Aunt Bea.

512
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:21,315
I think we just did. Excuse us.

513
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,648
Keep struttin', Aunt Bea.
You're doing good.

514
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:28,587
Hey, Ramona!

515
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,354
That Jeep of mine could sure use a wash,
don't you think?

516
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:34,692
The poor thing's been sitting in the garage
for 15 years now, Bea?

517
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:36,425
How much to hose her off?

518
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,837
Fifty dollars.

519
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:44,498
- Fifty d- No. No, no, no.
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:47,167
No, I would never take advantage
of you Iike that, Ramona.

521
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:49,438
That Jeep is my pride and joy.

522
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:53,107
For you to wash it,
and a "delishus" custom hand-wash at that...

523
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,116
I'm gonna have to insist on, uh-

524
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,654
I don't know- an even... hundred bucks?

525
00:34:58,755 --> 00:35:00,313
Really?

526
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:05,526
Yeah. Really. Not a penny Iess.

527
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:08,460
One hundred dollars?

528
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,294
Yeah.

529
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,630
Oh, just, uh, one Iittle condition.

530
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,670
Bea gets to chat with me.

531
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:17,171
Yeah, we can sit inside,
like the old car washes.

532
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:19,468
What do you say, Bea?

533
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,510
Like I said, it'd be nice to catch up.

534
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:23,010
ease, please, please.

535
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:29,010
How fast can you wash his car?

536
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:36,091
- Milady.
- Huh. I'm regretting this already.

537
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:50,104
It's Iike time stood still in here.

538
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,697
- I'd swear I was back in high school.
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:55,209
The good old days.

540
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,509
I wouldn't mind going back for a while.

541
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:02,415
Maybe I could, you know,
figure out where I messed up.

542
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,919
Oh, ancient history. I've moved on.

543
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:07,353
Yeah, I' say.

544
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:13,218
Back off, Romeo.

545
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:15,422
I think she Iikes me.

546
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:17,523
Don't bet on it.

547
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,067
Stay cool, Aunt Bea.

548
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:23,105
So I' be heading off to aska
in a few weeks.

549
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:26,471
After I get this thing up and running,
I am back on the road...

550
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:29,909
and out of your hair
for the next few years.

551
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:32,777
Well, my hair thanks you.

552
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:34,782
But it was inspired of you...

553
00:36:34,884 --> 00:36:38,047
bribing my niece just to talk to me,
Mr. Moneybags.

554
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,553
Well, a hundred bucks is a bargain.

555
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,114
Between you and me,
I was willing to go much higher.

556
00:36:43,226 --> 00:36:46,195
Oh, really?
Times have changed.

557
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,224
This from the guy who bought me a ring
for my sweet 16...

558
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,301
straight from a gum ball machine.

559
00:36:52,402 --> 00:36:55,963
- Oh, yeah. That's right.
- I even had to Iend you the quarter.

560
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:01,809
Let's face it.
I wanted that ring to be real.

561
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:03,811
You always knew it was disposable.

562
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:05,642
Just you and me in a nutshell.

563
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:07,340
Yeah.

564
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,418
Coming through. Ooh!

565
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,988
What do we have here?

566
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,921
Oh, no!

567
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,050
- "You and Me Forever Mix"?
- Oh, Hobart!

568
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:20,925
Could these be the romantic stylings
of the young Beatrice?

569
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,089
Oh, don't play it.
Oh, Hobart, that's embarrassing.

570
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,099
- ease don't play it.
- Of course I'm gonna play it.

571
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,295
This is so embarrassing.

572
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:58,998
Howie, help!

573
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:01,730
She's getting reeled in. Whoo!

574
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:03,362
- Howie!
- Ramona!

575
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:05,236
She's getting reeled in!

576
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:11,973
Hobart, do something!

577
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:26,728
I'm afraid to Iook.

578
00:38:36,706 --> 00:38:40,574
No, no, no.
The surface was wet. He tried hosing it off.

579
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:44,738
How do we get it off
without damaging the paint job underneath?

580
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:46,747
And if we bring it in, how much?

581
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:48,612
Ballpark?

582
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:50,549
What is that, hundreds?

583
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:53,781
- Thousands?
- No. No. Try this guy.

584
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,791
Well, this is gonna cost us a fortune.

585
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:58,861
Hello. I'd, Yes, I'll hold.

586
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:03,393
I... I'm so sorry.

587
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,300
It's all my fault.

588
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,733
You're sorry?

589
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:17,302
Uh, I'm sorry, because now
that I'm Iooking at it from a distance...

590
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:19,881
I realize that I should be thanking you.

591
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:23,384
I mean, Iook at it. It's- It's camouflaged.

592
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,388
And from what I hear,
the icy askan terrain Iooks-

593
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,390
Iooks just Iike that.

594
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,790
So I can just sneak right
up on those polar bears.

595
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:34,385
I don 't even have to get out of my Jeep.

596
00:39:35,798 --> 00:39:39,666
Well, I 'm- I 'm glad you Iike it?

597
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:41,669
- I Iove it.
- Hey, Hobart, are you crazy?

598
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:43,966
- You're not gonna leave it like that.
- No, no, no. No, no.

599
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:47,907
I paid for something "delishus,"
and Iook what I got- an Easter egg.

600
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,472
What do you think, Bea?

601
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:53,515
That a good Iook for me?

602
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,588
Sure.

603
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,853
It might even bring out your sensitive side.

604
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:11,066
Next time we clean the neighbor's garage...

605
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,931
it's coming out ofyour allowance,
not mine, Picasso.

606
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,005
For your records, my dear.

607
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,535
Now I have Iess money than I started with...

608
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:22,133
and I started with zero.

609
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:24,805
How about you focus
on things around the house instead?

610
00:40:24,914 --> 00:40:28,714
Like being a good helper,
getting along with your sisters.

611
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:30,843
I can feed Roberta, Mommy.

612
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:32,853
Don't worry about a thing. I' do it.

613
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:35,287
Here's the peas and a spoon.
Work some magic.

614
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,291
That's my girl.

615
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:41,789
Ooh, Iook!

616
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:46,335
Here comes the...
intergalactic space Iava.

617
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:49,837
Ramona, she's an infant. She doesn't know
what intergalactic space lava is.

618
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:52,407
- I don't even know what that is.
- Oh, you butt out, Beez-

619
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:59,845
Uh, I mean, thank you for your feedback.

620
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:01,849
I Iove feedback.

621
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,587
Love it.

622
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:09,256
Any progress today?

623
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,762
Yeah. I, um...
I got a couple of Ieads, but...

624
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:17,833
I don't know
if I'm executive material anymore.

625
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,835
Could be time to try something else.

626
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,668
- Like what?
- Fireman! Fireman, fireman.

627
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:26,699
Fireman.

628
00:41:28,377 --> 00:41:30,641
I don't know.

629
00:41:30,747 --> 00:41:32,647
You know, something creative.

630
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:35,013
Uh- I used to be a creative guy.

631
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,018
Yeah, well...

632
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,079
if you find a job that pays you
to be creative and have fun...

633
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,124
then maybe you can
give them my resume too.

634
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,156
Guess what! It's picture day tomorrow.

635
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:52,734
Oh! That's good.

636
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:54,803
Seeing your picture always cheers me up.

637
00:41:54,904 --> 00:41:57,202
Me too.

638
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,673
And I' make sure
it's the best picture ever, ever.

639
00:42:00,777 --> 00:42:02,904
It' be... dazzling.

640
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:04,775
We expect nothing Iess.

641
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:07,376
Say "peas."

642
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,075
"Peas, please."

643
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:12,052
Mom, I got Roberta to eat her peas.

644
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,986
Yummy peas.

645
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:23,729
That is disgus...

646
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,734
I mean...

647
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,327
what a darling Iittle sister.

648
00:42:29,438 --> 00:42:31,429
I wish there were 10 of you.

649
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:46,016
"Royal Peanut Butter.

650
00:42:46,122 --> 00:42:49,421
There's a bit of magic in every jar."

651
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,426
Is that one of your favorites?
That's the racket we gotta get you into.

652
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,996
'Cause those kids make millions.

653
00:42:55,097 --> 00:42:57,793
Beezus, do you think
I could be in a commercial Iike that?

654
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,164
Sure. You'd make a great frog.

655
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:03,102
- Hey.
- Hold still. I'm almost done.

656
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,504
It's picture perfect, right?

657
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:07,542
Let's be realistic, Ramona.

658
00:43:07,643 --> 00:43:09,634
This is a curling iron, not a magic wand.

659
00:43:09,745 --> 00:43:13,704
But all things considered,
I'd say you've never Iooked better.

660
00:43:16,118 --> 00:43:18,348
I Iove it!

661
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:20,354
Thanks, Beezus.

662
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:22,591
Ribbit!

663
00:43:25,261 --> 00:43:28,389
How your mom kept things
running so smooth beats me.

664
00:43:28,497 --> 00:43:30,522
Dad, since the room's almost done...

665
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:32,624
have you decided
who's gonna get it for sure?

666
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,364
Why? You know
somebody who's interested?

667
00:43:36,472 --> 00:43:38,167
Mm-hmm.

668
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:42,506
Okay, Iet me think about it,
'cause I Iike your persistence.

669
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:44,842
Yes. The answer's still no.

670
00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:45,879
Okay

671
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:56,152
Wow. You are definitely dazzling, Pickle.

672
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:59,057
- right, go smile big and make us proud.
- Bye, Dad.

673
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:02,187
Bye, Beezus. Bye, Roberta.

674
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:04,323
So I'm gonna take this...

675
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,596
and stick it right in the mouth
to make it Iook Iike fire.

676
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:13,797
Whoa. You Iook fancy, Susan.

677
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,674
My mother helped me pick out
the perfect ensemble.

678
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,714
She's in real estate, so she knows
a Iittle something about presentation.

679
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:22,613
She could help you too, Ramona,
if you want a consultation.

680
00:44:22,718 --> 00:44:25,949
- My mom Iets me pick out my own clothes.
- We can tell.

681
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,427
Excuse me. What are you doing?

682
00:44:32,528 --> 00:44:35,793
I'm Ioading my grape-a-pult. Watch and Iearn.

683
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,431
And what was the purpose of that?

684
00:44:39,535 --> 00:44:41,935
The question is, can anybody top it?

685
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,635
Have you ever seen the proper way
to crack a hard-boiled egg?

686
00:44:46,742 --> 00:44:49,302
Take notes if you want to, Susan.

687
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:06,794
"Say cheese."

688
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:08,386
Next.

689
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,590
- Say "cheese."
- Better just smile then, nice and big.

690
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,997
Next.

691
00:45:13,436 --> 00:45:15,495
- Say "cheese."
- Egg in her hair?

692
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:17,504
That's a new one.

693
00:45:17,606 --> 00:45:19,574
Next.

694
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,110
- Say "cheese."
- Cheese.

695
00:45:24,246 --> 00:45:26,771
How come you always
tell us to say "cheese"?

696
00:45:26,882 --> 00:45:30,374
- Don't you get tired of "cheese"?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

697
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:32,613
Next.

698
00:45:35,725 --> 00:45:39,126
Say... "peas."

699
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,489
Just when you thought
it was safe to open the mail.

700
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:50,165
I'm sorry about that raw egg, kiddo.

701
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:51,830
I guess I really messed that one up.

702
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:54,842
- I Iook Iike a troll.
- No, you don't.

703
00:45:54,944 --> 00:45:56,844
Yeah, she totally does.

704
00:45:56,946 --> 00:45:59,176
Hey. Maybe it's not "terrifical."

705
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:02,512
But this is definitely a keeper.
This is going in my wallet.

706
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:07,819
Come on. You wanna help me fold?

707
00:46:07,923 --> 00:46:11,723
I'd just mess it up, Dad.
Admit it. I'm a nuisance.

708
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:16,196
- You are not a nuisance.
- Mrs. Meacham says I'm a nuisance.

709
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:19,131
- And she's a professional.
- You know what I think?

710
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,671
You just have so much energy,
sometimes it gets away from you.

711
00:46:22,772 --> 00:46:24,706
I'm not saying that energy's bad.

712
00:46:24,807 --> 00:46:26,832
It's just you gotta Iearn how to control it.

713
00:46:26,942 --> 00:46:29,502
I mean, come on, let's be honest here.

714
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:32,581
Two months ago, you couldn't trust me
with the Iaundry, and now?

715
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:34,740
- Doesn't that Iook good?
- Yeah.

716
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,013
Yeah. right.
You just gotta try, kiddo.

717
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,520
We're both gonna turn this around.

718
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:42,523
Just keep trying, kiddo.

719
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:44,593
- Okay.
- That's my girl!

720
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:11,911
Hey. Whoa! Let me help you there.

721
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:12,855
Hey.

722
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:14,755
Hey.

723
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:16,722
Morning doughnut.

724
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:25,023
- Whoa!
- Oh!

725
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,193
Who would Iike to put this up?

726
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:30,898
- And what does that spell?
- Delicious.

727
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:34,772
Bye!
I ' miss you guys!

728
00:47:40,216 --> 00:47:42,946
Sweetie, you should come
and celebrate with us.

729
00:47:43,052 --> 00:47:45,714
- What am I celebrating?
- Well, you've been working so hard...

730
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,587
we thought you'd be kind of excited
about getting your own room.

731
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,798
T-minus three, two, one, blastoff!

732
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:22,356
Ramona!

733
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,757
Stop making so much noise.

734
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,852
Sorry. I 'm just enjoying my new room.

735
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:30,363
Stop gloating. It's not polite.

736
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:33,299
I 'm not gloating. I'm bouncing.

737
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:36,496
Well, if you want your junk,
you better go grab it now.

738
00:48:36,605 --> 00:48:38,869
Anything left over goes to Goodwill.

739
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:42,469
Remember me, Ramona? Baa!

740
00:48:42,578 --> 00:48:44,375
- Stop!
- Help me!

741
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,311
Give it back.

742
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:48,679
- Baa!
- Give it back.

743
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:51,150
So, what do you think?

744
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,781
Uh. That's far enough.

745
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,689
This is a no-pest zone.

746
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:04,792
Well, who needs you...
or your dumb teenager room?

747
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,360
- I Iike it by myself.
- Uh-huh. Sure you do.

748
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:12,963
When the Iights go out,
and then you start thinking...

749
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:17,205
about all the noises and the monsters...

750
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:21,113
and then you realize
you didn't check underyour bed...

751
00:49:21,217 --> 00:49:22,878
not carefully...

752
00:49:22,985 --> 00:49:24,976
don't come knocking on my door.

753
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:29,013
If you make it that far.

754
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:45,600
Slithering beast...

755
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:50,611
that feeds on pests with bad report cards.

756
00:50:02,091 --> 00:50:03,683
Picky Picky?

757
00:50:16,205 --> 00:50:18,264
Ramona, come on. Let's go. We're Iate.

758
00:50:18,374 --> 00:50:22,037
Dad, what's another word for "sick"?

759
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,977
Um, queasy? Nauseous?

760
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,139
Like really, really sick?

761
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:29,046
Oh. Bilious.

762
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,881
Dad, I feel bilious.

763
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,855
I don't think school's a good call right now.

764
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,358
Oh. You're in a suit.
Do you have an interview?

765
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:44,955
Well, yeah,
but I can change it if we have to.

766
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:48,059
Are you queasy sick or achy sick?

767
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:53,301
Well, I'm kind of feeling better now.

768
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:54,933
You sure?

769
00:50:55,044 --> 00:50:58,172
Okay, well, Iet's go.
We got, Iike, 60 seconds.

770
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,180
Fast, Iike a fireman.

771
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:02,409
Fifty-nine, 58...

772
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,543
57- Come on.

773
00:51:04,653 --> 00:51:07,747
Fifty-six, 55-

774
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,756
54-

775
00:51:12,094 --> 00:51:14,562
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye!

776
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:22,203
Hey, Ramona!
You've gotta see this. Come on.

777
00:51:22,304 --> 00:51:25,000
- What?
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

778
00:51:26,275 --> 00:51:28,436
Here. Check this out.

779
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:36,143
- Hobart!
- Yeah?

780
00:51:36,251 --> 00:51:38,776
Mind where you're digging.

781
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,549
We've got sprinkler pipes down there.

782
00:51:41,657 --> 00:51:44,353
Oh, is that what I keep hitting?

783
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,792
Don't worry, Mom. Relax. It's okay.

784
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,295
Oh!

785
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,366
- Good talk.
- What do you think he's doing?

786
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:54,698
Maybe he's digging
a secret tunnel to Istanbul.

787
00:51:54,803 --> 00:51:58,637
A spy network right through
your very own backyard.

788
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:03,144
Or maybe this house was built
on an old burial ground...

789
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,713
and I'm unlocking an ancient curse.

790
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:19,661
Open call?
That means anybody can audition, right?

791
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:25,996
Ramona, they don't want just anybody.
They want a princess.

792
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,763
- A million dollars.
- Take out your instruments. Good.

793
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:32,204
right. Grab a seat, kids.
Let's shake this rust out and start jammin'.

794
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:35,708
One, two, three, four.

795
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,580
Yeah! Yeah, you guys are tight!

796
00:53:08,076 --> 00:53:10,203
Ramona!

797
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,246
Why did you do that?

798
00:53:12,347 --> 00:53:15,441
I can't help it. They're mesmerizing.

799
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:19,112
But you've been doing it since kindergarten,
and it's getting old.

800
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:21,712
Look, I know things must be rough at home...

801
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,951
but don't take it out on my curls.

802
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:27,290
Okay. Hold on a second, guys. That was good.

803
00:53:27,396 --> 00:53:29,364
That was almost the song.

804
00:53:29,465 --> 00:53:34,129
So, um, guitars, quick rehearsal.
Everybody else, take five.

805
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:36,500
Ramona!

806
00:53:36,605 --> 00:53:40,166
What was that about? "Rough at home"?

807
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:44,075
- Well, your dad Iost his job, didn't he?
- Maybe.

808
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,171
Look, when people Iose their jobs, you know,
they start fighting...

809
00:53:47,282 --> 00:53:50,251
and then they get a divorce
and sell their houses.

810
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,082
It's textbook.
Look at the bright side, Ramona.

811
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,419
I mean, after my dad got Iaid off,
my mom sold her house...

812
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,789
got a real estate Iicense, so there's a plus.

813
00:53:58,894 --> 00:54:02,125
And then my dad got a new car
and moved to Tacoma.

814
00:54:02,231 --> 00:54:03,823
Tacoma?

815
00:54:05,968 --> 00:54:08,334
Susan, I'm so sorry.

816
00:54:08,437 --> 00:54:12,168
Well, now on my birthdays,
they both give me checks, so it works out.

817
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,607
Okay.

818
00:54:21,116 --> 00:54:23,846
Hey, Ramona?
Would you mind taking your seat again?

819
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:26,614
What are you doing by the window there?

820
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:28,383
I was-

821
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:31,823
I was wondering, where is Tacoma?

822
00:54:44,473 --> 00:54:47,704
- Repulsive.
- Oh, boy.

823
00:54:48,877 --> 00:54:52,904
right. You can all go to Iunch now.

824
00:54:53,015 --> 00:54:56,644
Are you...
Ramona, why are you wearing pajamas?

825
00:54:58,387 --> 00:55:02,687
'Cause firemen do it that way?

826
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,258
I see.

827
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:08,455
Well, pajamas under your clothes
and eggs in your hair.

828
00:55:08,564 --> 00:55:11,362
You and your father
are breaking new ground together.

829
00:55:13,168 --> 00:55:15,295
You get comfortable in there.

830
00:55:21,643 --> 00:55:23,577
Come on.

831
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:28,749
Come on!

832
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,681
You're kidding me.

833
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:34,620
Try this one.
Okay. No, no. That's no good.

834
00:55:34,723 --> 00:55:36,691
I think this one's gonna be good.

835
00:55:45,567 --> 00:55:47,535
How'd the interview go today, Daddy?

836
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:51,231
Well, I had to cancel the interview
when the nurse called.

837
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,041
But there's other jobs out there.

838
00:55:56,712 --> 00:56:00,011
Hey, we're not gonna Iet
one bad day get us down.

839
00:56:02,084 --> 00:56:06,817
Let's do somethin'... really special.

840
00:56:06,922 --> 00:56:10,153
Just me and you.
What would you like to do? Think big.

841
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:17,162
Well, you know that big bridge we took
when we went to Washington State?

842
00:56:17,265 --> 00:56:20,291
- Yeah.
- I've always wanted to stop in the middle...

843
00:56:20,402 --> 00:56:22,962
and have one foot in Oregon
and one in Washington.

844
00:56:23,071 --> 00:56:26,734
- Hmm?
- That way my Iegs have dual citizenship.

845
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,936
I Iike it.

846
00:56:30,045 --> 00:56:32,138
That's interesting. Interesting notion.

847
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:34,807
Not practical because the car's kaput...

848
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:36,816
but you're on the right track.

849
00:56:36,918 --> 00:56:39,546
I mean, it's bold, it's daring,
it's fairly inexpensive.

850
00:56:39,655 --> 00:56:41,646
Come on. Give me- What else?

851
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:46,026
We could draw it.

852
00:56:47,729 --> 00:56:51,392
Oh! I've got an idea.

853
00:56:54,603 --> 00:56:59,097
Let's me and you draw
the Iongest picture in the world.

854
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,040
What do you think?

855
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,354
Okay.

856
00:57:13,455 --> 00:57:17,357
I'm gonna draw our house,
and then I'm gonna draw Howie's house...

857
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:20,656
and school and Mount Hood...

858
00:57:20,762 --> 00:57:24,220
and everything else as far as I can see.

859
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,638
Daddy?

860
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:36,467
I think you draw better
than anybody in the whole world.

861
00:57:37,512 --> 00:57:41,312
Oh. Well, thank you, Pickle.

862
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,146
You know, I studied art
back in the day, as they say.

863
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,152
What happened?

864
00:57:47,189 --> 00:57:49,089
Did you get a bad report card?

865
00:57:49,191 --> 00:57:51,785
No.

866
00:57:51,893 --> 00:57:54,384
Beezus came along.

867
00:57:54,496 --> 00:57:56,930
Then I took the best job I could,
and before you know it...

868
00:57:57,032 --> 00:57:58,932
I was a vice president.

869
00:57:59,034 --> 00:58:02,231
- Then I came along?
- Yep. That's right.

870
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:04,237
And then Roberta.

871
00:58:06,575 --> 00:58:09,942
But I wouldn't change a thing.
You girls make my Iife very colorful.

872
00:58:30,232 --> 00:58:32,166
- Hi. Hey, Beezus.
- Hey.

873
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:35,202
- Wanna walk home?
- Sure.

874
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,861
Cool.

875
00:58:37,906 --> 00:58:39,806
Oh, man.

876
00:58:39,908 --> 00:58:43,207
When we were kids, I thought your dad was,
Iike, the king of ickitat Street.

877
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:46,405
Do you remember that gorilla hunt
in my backyard...

878
00:58:46,515 --> 00:58:49,916
when he made us set up the tents
and wait there all night...

879
00:58:50,018 --> 00:58:52,418
with bananas and butterfly nets?

880
00:58:52,521 --> 00:58:55,354
You ended up with mashed bananas
in your hair.

881
00:58:55,457 --> 00:58:57,789
I had poison ivy all over me.

882
00:58:57,893 --> 00:58:59,793
But it was also-

883
00:58:59,895 --> 00:59:02,693
- The best time we had that whole summer.
- Hands down.

884
00:59:06,735 --> 00:59:09,431
Yeah, well, he's not as funny these days.

885
00:59:09,538 --> 00:59:12,063
Why? What's going on?

886
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:15,439
He Iost his job a few weeks ago...

887
00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:19,913
and he acts Iike he's not worried,
for our sake, but I can tell he is.

888
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,040
And he should be.

889
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:25,017
What if he doesn't get something
that he Iikes?

890
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,156
What if he has to settle
for something that he hates...

891
00:59:29,257 --> 00:59:31,885
because of... us?

892
00:59:33,295 --> 00:59:35,456
Beezus, that's a big deal.

893
00:59:35,564 --> 00:59:38,362
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

894
00:59:40,936 --> 00:59:46,704
I don't know. Sometimes...
things feel different between us.

895
00:59:46,808 --> 00:59:50,835
Like it's not as easy to talk to you
as it used to be, you know?

896
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:55,616
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. A Iittle.

897
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,481
- It's not that I don't want to talk to you-
- No, no. I get you.

898
00:59:58,587 --> 01:00:00,885
- It's just very different.
- Different.

899
01:00:00,989 --> 01:00:02,889
Exactly.

900
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,550
Oh, gosh.

901
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:08,652
Um- Yeah.

902
01:00:08,763 --> 01:00:10,424
Thank you.

903
01:00:10,532 --> 01:00:13,330
You should probably button that.

904
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:17,531
Yeah. It's good to know
some things never change.

905
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:25,442
Since my Iast report had some holes in it-

906
01:00:25,547 --> 01:00:28,015
Mrs. Meacham gave me a do-over.

907
01:00:28,116 --> 01:00:30,710
So, may I present to you...

908
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:33,447
the Iongest picture in the world.

909
01:00:55,844 --> 01:01:00,804
Excuse me, but what about the paintings
in those big churches in Europe?

910
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:03,612
I mean, aren't they Ionger?

911
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:06,243
Yeah, but that's Europe.

912
01:01:06,354 --> 01:01:08,948
I mean, I 'm talkin'
about the whole world.

913
01:01:09,057 --> 01:01:12,185
Susan, you may save
your comments for Iater.

914
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,194
Ramona, go ahead.

915
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,992
My dad made this with me.

916
01:01:21,102 --> 01:01:24,071
He could have been an artist
when he was younger...

917
01:01:24,172 --> 01:01:26,140
but he decided to be my dad.

918
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:30,473
And he's teaching me how to draw, too,
which means he's patient.

919
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,774
P-A-T-I-E-N-T?

920
01:01:34,883 --> 01:01:38,250
But you really need to see it close up,
so come and enjoy the view.

921
01:01:43,058 --> 01:01:46,425
Who can see themselves in here?

922
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:59,499
Uh, "Looking for a princess in Portland"?

923
01:02:00,942 --> 01:02:03,172
Branding. They' eat it up.

924
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:05,178
Yeah?

925
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,748
Well, wait till they see this.

926
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:13,583
Every princess needs a Iittle sparkle.

927
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,656
Just mix this up.

928
01:02:17,258 --> 01:02:20,125
We have three little girls.
We have to be realistic.

929
01:02:20,228 --> 01:02:24,562
- I can 't wait another 10 years of my life.
- It's not settling!

930
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:28,925
But what about the kids?
They've got school, we got the mortgage.

931
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:32,097
Unbelievable.

932
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,368
Wait!

933
01:02:37,746 --> 01:02:40,044
Okay there, Sticky Picky.

934
01:02:40,148 --> 01:02:43,481
I know you're old and creaky, too,
but this is my bed tonight. Come on.

935
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:45,883
Okay? Come on. Come on.

936
01:02:45,987 --> 01:02:47,682
Good man.

937
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:50,257
- Dad, it's Picky Picky.
- Hey.

938
01:02:53,495 --> 01:02:57,625
Dad, are you and Mom getting a divorce?

939
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,632
No.

940
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,726
This is Iike a time-out for the night.

941
01:03:02,837 --> 01:03:05,965
Come on.
We' both be happily married in the morning.

942
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,042
- Mwah! Go to bed.
- Okay.

943
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:13,579
Dad, don't worry.

944
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:15,706
Things are gonna change for us.

945
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:17,717
I have a plan.

946
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:19,480
Now I am worried.

947
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,613
Look, Mom! It's the ice cream man!

948
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:38,766
Hey. You sure this is what you want?

949
01:03:40,008 --> 01:03:42,602
- Thanks for the ride, Mr. Kemp.
- No problem.

950
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:45,679
You know, you are allowed
to call me Hobart if you want.

951
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,045
No, thank you, Mr. Kemp.
This is strictly a business relationship.

952
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,914
- Okay.
- Wow! Good for you.

953
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,716
- right.
- At Ieast one of us is showing a Iittle restraint.

954
01:03:57,058 --> 01:03:59,253
- Break a leg, superstar.
- Okay.

955
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:02,729
Next is Ruby Hirsch.

956
01:04:02,831 --> 01:04:04,890
Hey, Susan.

957
01:04:04,999 --> 01:04:07,695
Wow. You Iook great.

958
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,702
Hello, Ramona.

959
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:14,173
Susan! How could you be a princess
without your tiara?

960
01:04:14,275 --> 01:04:17,005
- Hi, Mrs. Kushner.
- Hello, Ramona.

961
01:04:17,112 --> 01:04:19,478
Okay. Let's go. That Iooks beautiful.

962
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,416
Excuse me! Aunt Bea, I need a tiara!

963
01:04:27,522 --> 01:04:30,889
It takes a real man to be able
to drive around in this.

964
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,721
Oh, by the way, I talked to my publisher.

965
01:04:32,894 --> 01:04:34,725
He found me an apartment in Anchorage.

966
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,093
Very spacious. Got great views.

967
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:39,623
Room for two.

968
01:04:45,206 --> 01:04:46,833
Well.

969
01:04:48,409 --> 01:04:52,072
Maybe you can find
a nice polar bear to cuddle up with.

970
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,080
Eh, aska could be fun, Bea.

971
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,878
I mean, it is still the Iast great frontier.
You know that, right?

972
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,454
us, it's only a two-year commitment.

973
01:05:00,555 --> 01:05:03,615
Commitment was never your thing.

974
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:06,353
Okay. Now, that's just not fair.

975
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:08,986
Bea, you've gotta give me a chance here.
Come on.

976
01:05:09,097 --> 01:05:12,191
I've been traveling the world for over 10
years trying to get you out of my head.

977
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,666
- And you know what?
- What?

978
01:05:14,769 --> 01:05:16,669
It ain't workin'.

979
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:21,108
I didn't come here for this stupid Jeep.
I came here for you.

980
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:26,546
Come with me.

981
01:05:49,637 --> 01:05:52,606
Next is...

982
01:05:52,707 --> 01:05:54,436
Ramona Quimby.

983
01:06:00,515 --> 01:06:04,076
My goodness.
That's quite the tiara you have there.

984
01:06:05,186 --> 01:06:07,484
I designed it in the parking Iot.

985
01:06:10,692 --> 01:06:13,593
So tell me, why are you here today?

986
01:06:13,695 --> 01:06:17,688
'Cause my dad says that commercials
are the racket to be in.

987
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:20,029
Hmm. Twirl.

988
01:06:21,135 --> 01:06:22,102
Twirl.

989
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,550
Okay. Thank you, Ramona.

990
01:06:39,654 --> 01:06:41,747
Don't move.

991
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:44,792
A tiara made of burrs?

992
01:06:44,892 --> 01:06:48,453
It would have worked, Dad,
until I fell into their stupid sandwich.

993
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,758
Sandwich?

994
01:06:51,866 --> 01:06:56,132
- I won't even ask.
- Ow! You're doing it too fast!

995
01:06:56,237 --> 01:06:58,899
'Cause I'm Iate, Ramona. Very Iate.

996
01:06:59,007 --> 01:07:00,474
Sorry.

997
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:06,370
How's it Iook? Kinda trendy?

998
01:07:08,716 --> 01:07:11,981
Oh. Yes, well, that's one way of putting it.

999
01:07:12,086 --> 01:07:14,247
Listen up, ladies.

1000
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:16,880
I got a two-hour drive
to get to this interview...

1001
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,859
so I need you to be responsible
till your mom gets home.

1002
01:07:20,962 --> 01:07:23,260
You have her number at the office
if there's a problem...

1003
01:07:23,364 --> 01:07:26,663
but remember, she 's under a lot of stress,
so no fighting, okay?

1004
01:07:26,768 --> 01:07:29,293
Beezus, you're in charge. Baby monitor.

1005
01:07:29,404 --> 01:07:31,634
How come she 's always in charge?

1006
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:33,707
Um, have you seen your hair Iately?

1007
01:07:33,808 --> 01:07:35,799
- Imagine what you'd do to our house.
- Hey!

1008
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:38,470
Just try to be good- especially you.

1009
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:39,807
Bye!

1010
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:45,214
"Especiallyyou."

1011
01:07:57,165 --> 01:08:01,602
Ramona, I don't think making dinner
is gonna distract Mom from your hair.

1012
01:08:02,804 --> 01:08:06,001
It's worth a shot.

1013
01:08:06,107 --> 01:08:09,907
Quimby residence. Oh, hi, Henry.

1014
01:08:10,011 --> 01:08:12,673
I'm not sure if Beezus is available.

1015
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:15,772
- Give it to me! Stop! Give it to me!
- She could be in the bathroom.

1016
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:18,181
- Go away, you jerk!
- Wait. What did you say?

1017
01:08:18,286 --> 01:08:20,186
No, not you, Henry!

1018
01:08:20,288 --> 01:08:21,653
You put him on speaker, doofus!

1019
01:08:21,756 --> 01:08:25,351
- I'm Beezus! I Iove Henry!
- Shut up!

1020
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:29,360
Should I call back Iater?

1021
01:08:29,464 --> 01:08:31,091
- No! I want you!
- Huh?

1022
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:34,168
I mean, I wanna talk to you right now,
so now is a good time!

1023
01:08:34,268 --> 01:08:36,532
- Okay.
- Get off!

1024
01:08:39,006 --> 01:08:41,474
My hot dog souffle!

1025
01:08:46,013 --> 01:08:47,913
Stop!

1026
01:08:50,017 --> 01:08:52,110
Ramona!

1027
01:08:53,855 --> 01:08:55,914
Ramona, move!

1028
01:08:56,023 --> 01:08:58,651
Stop! Stop that! Drop it!

1029
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,228
- No!
- I said, drop it!

1030
01:09:11,205 --> 01:09:13,799
You will never change, will you?

1031
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:16,604
For a moment there,
I actually thought that you were maturing...

1032
01:09:16,711 --> 01:09:18,702
but you will always be a Iittle pest!

1033
01:09:22,049 --> 01:09:24,449
- I' go get her.
- No! Just stop!

1034
01:09:24,552 --> 01:09:26,452
Stop touching everything!

1035
01:09:26,554 --> 01:09:28,613
Everything that you touch you mess up...

1036
01:09:28,723 --> 01:09:30,623
including my Iove Iife.

1037
01:09:30,725 --> 01:09:32,955
You have a Iove Iife?

1038
01:09:34,195 --> 01:09:36,561
Just feed the cat and Ieave me alone!

1039
01:09:46,574 --> 01:09:48,565
Uh, hello?

1040
01:09:48,676 --> 01:09:52,043
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

1041
01:09:54,582 --> 01:09:56,880
Picky Picky?

1042
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:59,384
It's dinnertime.

1043
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,785
Come on.

1044
01:10:01,889 --> 01:10:04,221
Let's talk.

1045
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,623
Wake up.

1046
01:10:06,727 --> 01:10:09,287
Wake up, Iazy bum.

1047
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:19,235
Beezus!

1048
01:10:24,695 --> 01:10:26,595
Beezus?

1049
01:10:26,697 --> 01:10:28,927
I thought he was asleep, but he's not.

1050
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,603
What now?

1051
01:10:34,705 --> 01:10:37,071
He's dead.

1052
01:10:37,174 --> 01:10:40,905
Picky Picky's dead.

1053
01:10:42,346 --> 01:10:46,180
Don't worry. Mom will be home soon.
She' know what to do.

1054
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:48,774
No. Remember what Dad said?

1055
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:53,417
We can't make any trouble for Mom now.

1056
01:10:55,592 --> 01:10:57,492
Okay.

1057
01:10:59,329 --> 01:11:02,696
He was a Quimby before we were, Beezus.

1058
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:08,263
Picky Picky...

1059
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:11,941
I hope you have nine Iives.

1060
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,578
And maybe tomorrow...

1061
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:18,671
you can wake up as somebody else's cat...

1062
01:11:18,782 --> 01:11:20,249
start a new Iife.

1063
01:11:22,519 --> 01:11:25,818
I really hope
they feed you melon rind sometimes.

1064
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,426
I know you Iike that.

1065
01:11:36,233 --> 01:11:38,463
I think it's important...

1066
01:11:38,568 --> 01:11:40,468
that you know...

1067
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:43,971
Dad was just pretending
to forget your name.

1068
01:11:47,144 --> 01:11:48,668
He always knew it.

1069
01:11:50,247 --> 01:11:52,215
He really did Iove you.

1070
01:12:00,157 --> 01:12:02,387
We' miss you, Picky Picky.

1071
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:17,166
It's okay.

1072
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:29,082
You girls had to handle
all this tonight byyourselves?

1073
01:12:30,187 --> 01:12:31,654
I'm sorry.

1074
01:12:32,823 --> 01:12:35,724
We're okay, Mom.

1075
01:12:35,826 --> 01:12:39,728
How did I get so Iucky
to have two brave girls Iike you?

1076
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,798
Hmm?

1077
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:46,627
I'm home!

1078
01:12:46,736 --> 01:12:49,364
We have some news.

1079
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:52,135
So do l. I got the job.

1080
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:54,107
What?

1081
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:56,771
Great position.

1082
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,848
Start-up in eastern Oregon.

1083
01:13:00,116 --> 01:13:02,243
How do you girls feel about that?

1084
01:13:02,352 --> 01:13:04,877
Wait. To Iive there?

1085
01:13:06,556 --> 01:13:08,615
But what about the house?

1086
01:13:09,993 --> 01:13:12,188
We' get a new one there.

1087
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,130
What's your news?

1088
01:13:18,768 --> 01:13:20,668
Nothing.

1089
01:13:26,543 --> 01:13:29,011
Ramona?

1090
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:32,411
Will you sleep in here with me tonight?

1091
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:45,591
I'm not ready for a new school...

1092
01:13:46,696 --> 01:13:48,425
with all new kids.

1093
01:13:49,499 --> 01:13:51,296
Me neither.

1094
01:13:51,401 --> 01:13:53,369
But you' do fine.

1095
01:13:54,804 --> 01:13:58,262
You don't always
embarrass yourself Iike I do.

1096
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:01,469
You're the most prettiest,
perfect girl in high school...

1097
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:04,274
and everybody Ioves you.

1098
01:14:04,381 --> 01:14:08,112
Ramona,
those people don't know who I am, really.

1099
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,847
There's only one person
in that whole school who really knows me.

1100
01:14:13,957 --> 01:14:16,517
- Henry?
- Yeah.

1101
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,789
And that took 15 years.

1102
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:26,700
Who else is gonna wanna waste 15 years
getting to know me?

1103
01:14:30,106 --> 01:14:32,165
I would.

1104
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:38,941
Ramona...

1105
01:14:39,049 --> 01:14:41,517
I know that you think
being different is bad...

1106
01:14:44,187 --> 01:14:46,155
but it's not.

1107
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:52,019
You don't worry about coloring
inside the Iines, you know?

1108
01:14:52,128 --> 01:14:53,686
Huh?

1109
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:57,130
You're your own person.

1110
01:14:57,233 --> 01:14:59,394
You don't care what other people think.

1111
01:14:59,502 --> 01:15:01,766
It's brave being how you are.

1112
01:15:04,174 --> 01:15:06,074
Oh.

1113
01:15:06,176 --> 01:15:08,007
Well...

1114
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:11,603
sometimes I color inside the Iines.

1115
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:13,683
It really depends on the picture.

1116
01:15:13,783 --> 01:15:15,751
Yeah.

1117
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,682
All right.
So, how does this look?

1118
01:15:19,789 --> 01:15:22,451
It's perfect. Yeah, it's great.

1119
01:15:24,194 --> 01:15:27,322
Why does it have to be Susan's mom?

1120
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:30,024
She's supposed to be a very good agent,
sweetheart.

1121
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:36,763
That's great. Ta-da!

1122
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:43,470
Aren't you gonna help us, Ramona?
We only have a few hours to do this.

1123
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,810
I don't wanna help sell the house.

1124
01:15:45,915 --> 01:15:47,815
I wanted to save it.

1125
01:15:47,917 --> 01:15:50,078
Are you gonna fill these holes before you go?

1126
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:51,744
Howie wants to do it.

1127
01:15:51,855 --> 01:15:54,323
Why don't you get
your boyfriend Hobart to help?

1128
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:57,552
- He likes to dig.
- Isn't that the truth?

1129
01:15:57,661 --> 01:16:00,129
Now he wants me to go with him to Alaska.

1130
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:03,324
Last night, he sent roses.

1131
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:05,458
aska? Did you say yes?

1132
01:16:07,537 --> 01:16:09,664
I mean, I was tempted...

1133
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:12,241
but if I 'm gonna uproot my entire Iife...

1134
01:16:12,342 --> 01:16:14,902
I need some real sign of commitment.

1135
01:16:15,011 --> 01:16:17,479
- I'm sorry, Bea.
- Oh, no. Don't be.

1136
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:21,243
We had our fight,
and now he's running away again.

1137
01:16:21,351 --> 01:16:25,811
In the Iong run,
I saved myself a massive heartache...

1138
01:16:25,922 --> 01:16:29,050
and just replaced it with a... small one.

1139
01:16:34,197 --> 01:16:37,428
Ramona, grab a hose and help out, okay?

1140
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:41,698
I know Iife stinks,
but we still have to make the yard Iook good.

1141
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:44,603
Everything will be okay, babe.
Onwards and upwards.

1142
01:16:50,113 --> 01:16:52,308
Oh, I see! Very funny.

1143
01:16:52,415 --> 01:16:56,181
Who did that? Bea? That's just adorable.

1144
01:16:56,286 --> 01:16:59,016
assy, Bea. Very classy.

1145
01:16:59,122 --> 01:17:02,853
Now I gotta go inside
and change all my clothes.

1146
01:17:02,959 --> 01:17:05,086
Real nice.

1147
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,527
Bea.

1148
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,966
That's for the roses, sweetheart.
They need water.

1149
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:17,165
Oh! There it is! Exhibit "A"!

1150
01:17:17,273 --> 01:17:19,400
The class clown hasn't changed at all!

1151
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:20,908
Oh, really?

1152
01:17:26,015 --> 01:17:28,381
Okay. That's how it is, huh?

1153
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:32,512
Howie! Willa Jean!

1154
01:17:32,622 --> 01:17:34,556
Mom!

1155
01:17:34,657 --> 01:17:36,522
Ladies, I need backup!

1156
01:17:38,661 --> 01:17:41,061
- Find a garden hose!
- Okay. Come on.

1157
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:49,334
I hope you get frostbite in aska!

1158
01:17:51,941 --> 01:17:54,239
Be strong. Be strong, Willa Jean.

1159
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:57,211
Be strong!

1160
01:17:59,682 --> 01:18:02,116
Get 'em!

1161
01:18:03,853 --> 01:18:07,254
Yeah! Now what? Now what?

1162
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,583
Aunt Bea!

1163
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,625
- Go, go, go!
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1164
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:19,895
I think we won. I think we won!

1165
01:18:20,003 --> 01:18:22,528
Give me some! Whoo-hoo!

1166
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:25,904
Nice job, you guys. You were animals!

1167
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:32,639
Look who's crying now!

1168
01:18:36,686 --> 01:18:41,089
My pipes! I told you, my pipes!

1169
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:51,167
- What's all the shouting about?
- Landscaping.

1170
01:18:54,537 --> 01:18:56,437
Oh!

1171
01:18:57,707 --> 01:19:00,301
What?

1172
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:03,174
Hobart was right!
It's an ancient curse!

1173
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:12,855
What?

1174
01:19:15,692 --> 01:19:17,956
I knew it was around
here somewhere!

1175
01:19:18,061 --> 01:19:20,120
Bea! Bea, come here. Come here.

1176
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,596
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

1177
01:19:24,601 --> 01:19:28,537
Oh, Beatrice,
I buried this baby a Iong time ago...

1178
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:31,607
and I figured I'd find it again someday
when I was ready.

1179
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:33,903
I still wish that I could go back and fix...

1180
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:37,002
all the stupid things I did
when we were younger.

1181
01:19:39,115 --> 01:19:41,675
I guess this is as close as I can get.

1182
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:56,165
You kept all this stuff?

1183
01:19:56,266 --> 01:19:57,790
Yeah.

1184
01:20:01,504 --> 01:20:03,472
That's my gum ball ring.

1185
01:20:15,051 --> 01:20:18,418
Bea, I don't want to go anyplace else
without you.

1186
01:20:19,522 --> 01:20:21,490
I Iove you.

1187
01:20:22,759 --> 01:20:24,659
Will you marry me?

1188
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:32,334
You will?

1189
01:20:52,155 --> 01:20:55,613
Guts!

1190
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:57,784
My head is spinning!

1191
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:00,624
We must be crazy! We' have to go
to the courthouse and make it official.

1192
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,721
No, we ain't goin' to no stinking courthouse.

1193
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:04,993
If we're gonna do something crazy,
we're gonna do it with style.

1194
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:06,625
We're gonna throw a real wedding.

1195
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:09,102
- Honey, they want you in aska in three days.
- That's plenty of time.

1196
01:21:09,205 --> 01:21:11,969
Sure. But what about a church or food...

1197
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,043
or, say, a wedding dress?

1198
01:21:14,143 --> 01:21:16,407
You can use mine.
You always said you Iiked it.

1199
01:21:16,512 --> 01:21:18,639
- We can just alter it.
- Yeah! See? I Iike that idea.

1200
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:21,216
- There you go!
- Hand-me-downs. It never ends, Ramona.

1201
01:21:21,317 --> 01:21:23,945
Yeah. We get the word out, we book a band...

1202
01:21:24,053 --> 01:21:25,543
boom- we got a wedding!

1203
01:21:25,655 --> 01:21:27,816
People can bring their own food,
their own chairs.

1204
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:32,554
All we need is a little love
and a few bridesmaids.

1205
01:21:32,662 --> 01:21:34,892
Oh! I 've always wanted to be a bridesmaid.

1206
01:21:34,998 --> 01:21:37,466
Ah! Well, that was easy. Anybody else?

1207
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:40,900
- Ramona? Ramona?
- What do you say? Will you do us the honor?

1208
01:21:43,172 --> 01:21:45,436
Ramona?

1209
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:47,133
Sea bass!

1210
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,741
- See what?
- Oh, it's an inside joke. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1211
01:21:51,848 --> 01:21:53,645
You said you wouldn't get reeled in.

1212
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,775
You said I would always have you around!

1213
01:21:55,885 --> 01:21:57,876
Hey, Ramona? Get back here and apologize.

1214
01:21:57,987 --> 01:22:00,547
Honey, please come talk to me.

1215
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:12,198
You have room for a piano.

1216
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:14,360
Also, look at this built-in desk.
It's fabulous.

1217
01:22:36,392 --> 01:22:37,984
Here.

1218
01:22:42,265 --> 01:22:44,358
- Ramona?
- Stuff that's to go around here, right?

1219
01:22:44,467 --> 01:22:46,332
Ramona!

1220
01:22:53,142 --> 01:22:55,269
Help, anybody!

1221
01:22:56,913 --> 01:22:59,473
- Oh, Ramona!
- Whoa, whoa!

1222
01:22:59,582 --> 01:23:02,016
- Got you! I got you! Come on, honey.
- Okay. Hold on.

1223
01:23:02,118 --> 01:23:04,348
We got you!

1224
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:07,014
We saw your underpants.

1225
01:23:07,123 --> 01:23:09,250
Hey, enough.

1226
01:23:09,358 --> 01:23:12,384
Hey, enough.
Stop the teasing. Go outside.

1227
01:23:12,495 --> 01:23:14,690
Happens all the time. Thank you.

1228
01:23:14,797 --> 01:23:17,163
Okay, Ramona, that's it.

1229
01:23:17,266 --> 01:23:19,860
These antics of yours gotta stop right now.

1230
01:23:19,969 --> 01:23:22,335
You're making our Iives really difficult.

1231
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:25,669
I thought I made it colorful, Dad.

1232
01:23:25,775 --> 01:23:29,074
Not in the middle of our
open house. Come on!

1233
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:32,579
You said you were gonna be more responsible.
It's time to grow up.

1234
01:23:32,682 --> 01:23:35,412
Dad, can't you see I'm trying?

1235
01:23:35,518 --> 01:23:38,419
- Well, you gotta try harder.
- Dad?

1236
01:23:38,521 --> 01:23:42,753
- Mrs. Meacham's on the phone. She needs to talk to you.
- Oh, great. What now?

1237
01:23:42,859 --> 01:23:44,793
Sweetie.

1238
01:23:52,535 --> 01:23:55,299
- Ramona, your father was just-
- Mom!

1239
01:23:55,404 --> 01:23:58,931
I 'm nine years old.
I think I can tell when I'm not wanted.

1240
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:01,339
I just have to run away.

1241
01:24:01,444 --> 01:24:05,141
- Ramona, don't be silly. You're not gonna run away.
- No, I mean it.

1242
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:08,440
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1243
01:24:10,887 --> 01:24:12,787
How Iong will you be gone?

1244
01:24:14,857 --> 01:24:17,792
I mean, just in case people start asking.

1245
01:24:18,995 --> 01:24:20,462
Forever.

1246
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:26,258
Well, in that case,
I think you're gonna need a bigger suitcase.

1247
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:34,739
Okay. Now, I've added your dad's old sweater.

1248
01:24:34,844 --> 01:24:36,812
I don't want you to get cold at night.

1249
01:24:36,913 --> 01:24:41,577
It's a Iittle big on you now,
but you' eventually grow into it.

1250
01:24:41,684 --> 01:24:44,244
Oh, and do you plan on brushing your teeth?

1251
01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:47,313
That's my girl.

1252
01:24:47,423 --> 01:24:50,221
I packed your toothbrush and your toothpaste.

1253
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,859
Okay?

1254
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:55,487
Just promise me that
you' brush your teeth every single night.

1255
01:24:58,734 --> 01:25:00,599
There you go.

1256
01:25:03,773 --> 01:25:05,968
righty.

1257
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:15,483
Don't forget to write.

1258
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:13,894
Daddy.

1259
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:25,744
Gettin' on or not?

1260
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:28,940
Ramona?

1261
01:27:29,051 --> 01:27:31,485
Sweetie? Ramona?

1262
01:27:39,495 --> 01:27:41,395
M-Mom?

1263
01:27:41,497 --> 01:27:42,828
- Ramona?
- Mom!

1264
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:46,600
Yes. Where are you?

1265
01:27:46,702 --> 01:27:50,160
- Can you hear me? Mom?
- Ramona, sweetie?

1266
01:28:11,193 --> 01:28:13,684
You made my bag heavy on purpose.

1267
01:28:15,731 --> 01:28:18,256
Well, what else was I supposed to do, huh?

1268
01:28:18,367 --> 01:28:20,801
I'd be just Iost without my Ramona.

1269
01:28:20,903 --> 01:28:23,633
I'm sorry.

1270
01:28:23,739 --> 01:28:26,299
I just thought you all
would be better off without me.

1271
01:28:26,409 --> 01:28:30,209
You don't think we'd Iet you get away that
easy, do you? You're a Quimby for Iife.

1272
01:28:36,752 --> 01:28:39,220
I hope nobody I know sees us out here.
We're so weird.

1273
01:29:27,203 --> 01:29:29,103
In sickness and in health.

1274
01:29:29,205 --> 01:29:32,038
- For richer or for poorer.
- For richer or for poorer.

1275
01:29:32,141 --> 01:29:34,109
And I promise my Iove to you.

1276
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:36,701
And I promise my Iove to you.

1277
01:29:36,812 --> 01:29:38,973
And I promise my Iove to you.

1278
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:44,317
May I have the rings, please?

1279
01:29:48,724 --> 01:29:51,056
Pull it off.

1280
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,490
Well...

1281
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,467
Don't panic, folks. It's only plastic.

1282
01:30:12,848 --> 01:30:14,247
Ramo...

1283
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,584
Oh. Babe?

1284
01:30:23,859 --> 01:30:25,918
Ah. Look at you.

1285
01:30:26,028 --> 01:30:28,326
Nice work, Ramona.

1286
01:30:42,444 --> 01:30:45,311
Hobart, that's... That's...

1287
01:30:45,414 --> 01:30:48,178
That's... That's real.

1288
01:30:48,284 --> 01:30:52,186
Yeah, and I still owe you that quarter.

1289
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:55,280
And I'm gonna spend the rest of my Iife
trying to pay it back.

1290
01:31:00,563 --> 01:31:02,190
Thank you.

1291
01:31:06,402 --> 01:31:09,166
Hobart, you may kiss the bride.

1292
01:31:21,817 --> 01:31:23,717
All right, Beatrice.

1293
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:27,220
This song is dedicated to you from Hobart.
Hey, buddy.

1294
01:31:27,323 --> 01:31:28,813
Okay.

1295
01:31:28,924 --> 01:31:31,449
One, two. There we go. That's good.

1296
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:50,745
- Hey, Beezus, I 've been Iooking for you.
- hi.

1297
01:31:50,846 --> 01:31:52,746
- Nice wedding, huh?
- Yeah.

1298
01:31:56,785 --> 01:31:59,117
Okay, Iisten. Um, Beezus.

1299
01:31:59,221 --> 01:32:02,884
I know that you're moving, and that's bad.

1300
01:32:02,992 --> 01:32:05,017
But in a way it's also good, because...

1301
01:32:05,127 --> 01:32:08,358
I would never have the guts
to say this if you weren't.

1302
01:32:08,464 --> 01:32:10,091
So...

1303
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:13,635
I don't think of you as a friend.

1304
01:32:13,736 --> 01:32:16,466
No, I mean- No. That came out wrong.

1305
01:32:16,572 --> 01:32:19,268
I mean, I think about you,
Iike, a Iot, all the time.

1306
01:32:19,375 --> 01:32:21,741
It's just- Oh, no. You're Iaughing.

1307
01:32:23,979 --> 01:32:25,879
Why are you Iaughing?

1308
01:32:25,981 --> 01:32:29,314
Um- No, I'm sorry.
I'm Iistening. I am. It's just-

1309
01:32:33,856 --> 01:32:35,824
You've got something on your shirt.

1310
01:32:44,967 --> 01:32:46,434
Gotcha.

1311
01:32:46,535 --> 01:32:49,299
Yeah.

1312
01:32:54,843 --> 01:32:58,006
Um, we should probably go dance
while we can...

1313
01:32:58,113 --> 01:32:59,944
'cause the band has a curfew, so-

1314
01:33:00,049 --> 01:33:02,415
Yeah, Iet's dance. Okay.

1315
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:20,768
I think it's time
for the father-daughter dance.

1316
01:33:24,139 --> 01:33:26,733
You did a wonderful job today, Pickle.

1317
01:33:26,842 --> 01:33:29,811
You were a perfect bridesmaid.

1318
01:33:29,912 --> 01:33:31,345
Thank you.

1319
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:36,750
- Dad?
- Yeah?

1320
01:33:36,852 --> 01:33:39,480
What were you and Mrs. Meacham
just talking about?

1321
01:33:39,588 --> 01:33:43,684
'Cause whatever I did wrong,
I probably didn't mean it.

1322
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:46,852
Well, believe it or not,
we weren't talking about you at all.

1323
01:33:46,962 --> 01:33:48,395
Really?

1324
01:33:48,497 --> 01:33:50,863
Yeah, she was talking about an opening...

1325
01:33:50,966 --> 01:33:54,231
for an art teacher at your school next term.

1326
01:33:54,336 --> 01:33:56,304
Remember when she called the house
the other day?

1327
01:33:56,405 --> 01:33:59,966
Well, she told me that she passed
that mural of ours on to the principal...

1328
01:34:00,075 --> 01:34:02,043
who mentioned it to the superintendent.

1329
01:34:02,144 --> 01:34:06,706
Long story short,
it's crummy pay, it's part-time.

1330
01:34:06,815 --> 01:34:10,182
I hear some of those kids
down at your school can be a real handful.

1331
01:34:10,285 --> 01:34:11,547
Oh!

1332
01:34:11,653 --> 01:34:14,986
But I'm thinking I'm gonna take it.

1333
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:19,889
Oh, my gosh!
That's better than a fireman!

1334
01:34:19,995 --> 01:34:21,394
I know.

1335
01:34:23,465 --> 01:34:26,957
I owe it all to you, Ramona.

1336
01:34:27,069 --> 01:34:29,037
You told me I could do anything.

1337
01:34:29,138 --> 01:34:31,231
It took me this Iong to believe it.

1338
01:34:32,674 --> 01:34:34,733
You really did save us, kiddo.

1339
01:34:56,331 --> 01:34:59,164
Beezus! Beezus!

1340
01:34:59,268 --> 01:35:01,168
We don't have to move anymore!

1341
01:35:06,241 --> 01:35:07,868
- Mrs. Meacham!
- Yes.

1342
01:35:07,976 --> 01:35:11,104
- I don't have to move anymore.
- I know.

1343
01:35:11,213 --> 01:35:13,738
We' be together for the rest of the year.

1344
01:35:13,849 --> 01:35:15,976
I shall pace myself accordingly.

1345
01:35:17,619 --> 01:35:19,587
Thanks for helping my dad.

1346
01:35:20,756 --> 01:35:22,724
I just passed along the mural.

1347
01:35:22,825 --> 01:35:24,725
You're the one who inspired it.

1348
01:35:24,827 --> 01:35:29,594
I may not be an art critic, but I certainly
know something "terrifical" when I see it.

1349
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,974
Go on, now.

1350
01:35:40,075 --> 01:35:42,669
- Shake your booty.
- Okay.

1351
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:53,551
Oh! Bye!

1352
01:35:53,655 --> 01:35:56,180
Oh, bye, Mom

1353
01:35:56,291 --> 01:35:58,259
- I ' call you from aska.
- Okay.

1354
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,827
Drive safely.

1355
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:05,532
Wait! Don't go yet!

1356
01:36:05,634 --> 01:36:07,534
Don't go yet, Aunt Bea!

1357
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:14,005
So you can always have me around.

1358
01:36:23,051 --> 01:36:26,680
Ramona, you're extraordinary.

1359
01:36:35,764 --> 01:36:37,698
Bye!

1360
01:36:37,799 --> 01:36:40,791
- Bye!
- We Iove you!

1361
01:37:26,748 --> 01:37:29,148
Hey!

1362
01:37:36,725 --> 01:37:40,024
This one goes out
to you and yours, worldwide.

1363
01:38:00,182 --> 01:38:03,982
It's true.

1364
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:06,452
You call me?
