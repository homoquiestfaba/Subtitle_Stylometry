but, uh...

353
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,512
I just need to see your daughter for
a second, Mrs. Bartle.

354
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:00,597
Well, could it wait, Dr. Cahill?

355
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,933
We're in the middle of our
vanishing species lecture series.

356
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:03,800
Uh...

357
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:05,736
Why don't you
join us for a moment, Doc,

358
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,671
and we'll talk after Henry's done.

359
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,105
Okay.

360
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,674
All right. Thanks.

361
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,880
MRS. BARTLE:
It's all right, Henry. Go ahead.

362
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,366
(COOING)

363
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,620
HENRY: But is nearly extinct.

364
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:25,922
Greater Prairie-Chickens are brown,

365
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,741
with orange eyebrows and fly like ducks.

366
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,644
The Greater Prairie-Chicken
live in Illinois and not Maine,

367
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:33,130
so I couldn't bring one to class.

368
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:35,615
Instead, I drew this picture,

369
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:37,617
and my dad let me bring in Carly,

370
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:40,270
who is not a Greater Prairie-Chicken.

371
00:25:40,337 --> 00:25:43,173
The Greater Prairie-Chicken
is a grassland bird.

372
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,259
It eats grasshoppers, ants,
and leafhoppers,

373
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,962
and it lives only two to three years.

374
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,283
During mating, the male Prairie-Chickens
do a dance called booming.

375
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,952
They stomp their feet on the ground,

376
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,169
flutter and jump,

377
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:58,204
spread their tail feathers out like a fan

378
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,957
and puff up the air satchel
on their necks

379
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:03,209
to attract female chickens.

380
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:05,044
(CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

381
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:15,472
Oh. That's charming.

385
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,688
That was Clementine.

386
00:26:48,756 --> 00:26:50,323
The class pet.

387
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,947
I feel horrible.

388
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:58,849
I think you traumatized them for life.

389
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,184
I think I've been traumatized for life.

390
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,653
Sorry. I'm just not feeling that friendly
toward bugs lately.

391
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,155
Really.
-Yeah.

392
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,057
Last night I found a whole 
army of cockroaches in my refrigerator.

393
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:08,859
I mean, big suckers.

394
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:10,193
Gross.
-Yeah.

395
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,461
And I think Jack Wald put 'em there.

396
00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:14,030
What? Jack put bugs
in your refrigerator?

397
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:15,765
Yeah. How else could they get in there?

398
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,001
Well, bugs can find their way
into any place,

399
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,569
but I doubt it was Jack Wald.

400
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:21,238
Oh, really? Why?

401
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:22,538
Well, I just...

402
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:25,141
It just doesn't seem
like something Jack would do.

403
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,627
Nell, he's obviously trying to
drive me out of my house.

404
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:30,546
I don't know.
Jack's not the psychological
torture-type.

405
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:33,983
He's more the
"get drunk and breathe in your face" type.

406
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,385
Oh, yeah.
I've seen that as well.

407
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:37,620
Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

408
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:38,888
Be honest.

409
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:40,990
How bad is this roach problem?

410
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,926
Well, I'll put it to you this way.

411
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:46,062
I won't be eating
chicken any time soon.

412
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,165
Well, you can use the
over the counter method, or...

413
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,367
If you promise not to poison yourself,

414
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:53,970
I can fix you up with something stronger.

415
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:56,405
I think I need the full artillery.

416
00:27:56,473 --> 00:27:58,407
Follow me.
-Following.

417
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:05,064
Okay. Let's see. Hmm.

418
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:13,740
Hey... Who painted this?

419
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:16,843
That? I did.
-Really?

420
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,145
Yeah. Why?
-'Cause they're good.

421
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:22,915
Thanks.

422
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:24,651
No, really, Nell.
You know, you could sell these.

423
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,353
No.
-Well, why the heck not?

424
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,087
I never really thought about it.

425
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:31,190
Oh, yeah?
How much you want for this one?

426
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:33,326
You really want it?
-I certainly do.

427
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:35,094
I think this would look
excellent in my house.

428
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:36,529
Well then, Doc, it's yours.

429
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:39,799
No. You can't do that.
That's not selling.

430
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:42,201
You gotta take some for it, Nell.
Come on.

431
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:43,770
Okay then.

432
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:45,372
You can owe me one.

433
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:49,141
The next time I sprain my ankle or something,
you can fix me up for free.

434
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:52,679
Deal?
-All right. Deal.

435
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:55,982
There.
It's the answer to your infestation problem.

436
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:58,918
If it were a snake it would have bit me.

437
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:01,020
We used to have a problem with gypsy moths
years back.

438
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:03,055
We had to keep spraying this stuff.

Phenoxyphenyl methyl dichloroethenyl.

And in English.

442
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,365

you've got a little bug problem.

446
00:29:26,914 --> 00:29:29,549
Maybe you want us to come out
and take a look?

447
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:31,551
I'm good with bugs.

448
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,387
Maybe you should just stay away from my house.
Fix my power instead, huh?

00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:36,322
Our house, ah...

450
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,025
That's right, Eamon.
It's his house now.

451
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:41,194
You have to forgive us, Doctor.
Sometimes we forget.

452
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:42,729
You know what?
You can harass me all you want,

453
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:44,798
but I'm not leaving town.
You got that?

454
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:46,466
Harass you?
Yeah.

455
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:48,868
What are you talking about?
Oh, you know damn well.

456
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,204
I sure don't.

457
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:52,606
I'm talking about the bugs, Wald.

458
00:29:52,673 --> 00:29:54,908
I'm talking about a refrigerator
full of cockroaches.

459
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:57,427
You think I put bugs in your refrigerator?

460
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,595
Yeah, that's right. I do.

461
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,130
Oh, you chowder head.
(CHUCKLING)

462
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,167
I think you're spending too much time
out there alone in the woods.

463
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:08,121
Really. What time was that?

464
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:11,657
Okay. Okay, yeah.

465
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:13,192
Yeah, no, I know where you mean.

466
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,866
Uh, all right.
Listen, Guy.  Just sit tight.

467
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:22,368
Okay, I'll be right down.

468
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:30,409
Now, why don't you come on in and let us
buy you a drink.

469
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:31,644
Just stay away from my house.

470
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,696
Or what?

471
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:36,132
You're gonna hit me with your stethoscope?

472
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,134

All right, Wald.

475
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:46,009
Don't make the mistake of picking 
a fight with me thinking I won't fight back.

476
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,044
Is that a threat?

477
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,630
Take it any way you want.
-Oh, you hear him?

478
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:52,249
You hear what he said to me?

479
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,750
SHERIFF: All right, boys.

480
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:56,136
Show's over.

481
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:59,556
You fix this man's power yet, Jack?

482
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:01,291
Why, Sheriff,
we were just fooling with him.

483
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:03,159
All right, guys, clear out of here.

484
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:04,961
Go on, go home, go have another drink,

485
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:06,746
but off this street.
Come on. Go.

486
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:10,200
Jack, I want his power turned on today.

487
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:11,767
For Pete's sake.
-Go on.

488
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:13,403
Trying to be friendly.

489
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:16,839
I'm going to the block and tackle.

490
00:31:16,907 --> 00:31:18,741
Thanks, Sheriff.
I owe you one.

491
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,545
Good. Well, then you won't mind
lending me your expertise for a while.

492
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,280
What, somebody's sick?

493
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:25,748
Somebody's dead.

Kept to himself. Ran the lighthouse.

he was pulling in his traps.

00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,294
What do you think, Doc?

497
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:38,845
It's kind of hard to tell.

498
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:40,863
When was the last time he was seen alive?

499
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,481
Yesterday. He had lunch
at the Red Claw.

500
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:46,503
Was he prone to any kind of seizures?

501
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,971
Epileptic or otherwise?

502
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,755
I don't know.

503
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,457
Could've been, I guess.
I don't know.

504
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:54,510
Hello.

505
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,638
Stupid old fool.

506
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:08,107
I guess I can
handle this from now on, Doc.

507
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:09,959
Take a look at this, will you?

508
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:13,380
These marks here.
These caused by crabs?

509
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:16,649
Anything could've caused that.
Crabs, sea lice, anything.

510
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:22,122
Planning on doing an autopsy?

511
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,757
Are you kidding?

512
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:26,092
It'd take at least a week
to get a medical examiner out here.

513
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,012
GUY: Same thing happened to
Tom Hale back in '88.

514
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,596
Got drunk,

515
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:33,049
passed out and drowned in a foot of water.

516
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,617
Then the crabs got him.

517
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:37,136
Well, I think you should do an autopsy,
just to be sure.

518
00:32:37,203 --> 00:32:38,588
I mean, if you don't wanna
wait for the medical examiner,

519
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,490
then I can do a rudimentary examination.

520
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,860
I appreciate your concern, Doc.

521
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,997
This old guy had no wife,
no kids, no one to answer to.

522
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:50,200
And since they put
that timer in the lighthouse,

523
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,035
he didn't have anything to do.

524
00:32:52,102 --> 00:32:55,355

shouldn't have been stiff.

all over the back of it.

680
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,135
Now, I think those red marks
were insect bites,

681
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:45,871
and certain insect bites
can cause paralysis.

682

Hmm. But cockroaches
don't bite.

Well, I'm not.
I'm sure as hell gonna find out.

698

You think he's still down there?

699
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,227
Maybe we should run the water,
just in case.

Yeah, except that the pump runs
on electricity,

when I'll get that back.

Are you sure you didn't just
blow a fuse?

703
00:49:49,635 --> 00:49:52,471
I'm sure.
I checked the fuses before I left.

704
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,038
Did you flick 'em?

705
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:56,875
You didn't flick 'em.

706

what happened out there.

Well, we got these things
living out here in Maine.

They look like cockroaches,
but they have pincers.

they're biting people</i>

That's impossible.

Well, Doctor, I understand
it may be unlikely,

is that Jack was a big pain

00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:48,369
now you're gonna go
poking around his body?

is what I tell you to do.

Where's the sheriff?
