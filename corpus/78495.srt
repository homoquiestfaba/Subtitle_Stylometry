1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,590
Father, look kindly on your children
who put their trust in you.

2
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,070
Bless them and keep them from all harm.

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,516
Strengthen them against
the attacks of the devil.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,594
May they never offend you,
but seek to love you in all they do.

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,350
May Almighty God bless you,
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,069
The Mass has ended.
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,958
Thanks be to God.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,991
Good morning, Mary. How are you?

9
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,790
Good morning, Elizabeth. How are you?

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,677
Good morning, Bernie.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,991
Father, would you say a prayer
to Our Lady for an intervention?

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,116
- What's wrong? Is someone sick?
- No.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,829
I just want us to pray for my daughter
to lose her driving licence.

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,638
Case number 37422: Veronica Guerin.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,274
Almost 1200 parking tickets.

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,473
March 10th, speeding ticket.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,835
108 miles per hour.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,389
Just last month another speeding ticket
for driving at 104 miles per hour.

19
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,917
Well, now, I think that shows
some improvement by my client, Judge.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,470
I'll alert mothers it's safe
to let their children back on the streets.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,476
I... I deserve to lose this case, Judge.
That's fair enough, you know.

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,839
But if I can't drive, I can't do my job. I'm
a journalist with the Sunday Independent.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,472
We all know who you are, Miss Guerin.
That does not grant you immunity.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,435
This is Bernie Guerin. I can't take your call
at the moment. Please leave a message.

25
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,715
Mum, I'm driving!
Can you believe it? He let me off.

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,076
He actually let me off.
I love you, Mum. Talk to you.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,311
Ah, no! You're having me on.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,949
No, I swear to God. Just a £100 fine
and a warning. I'm behind the wheel again.

29
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,873
- It's your ma, the criminal.
- Hi, Ma.

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,748
Well, I hope you've learned a lesson
and reformed your ways, young lady.

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,796
- Hey, you're not speeding now, are you?
- No, of course I'm not.

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,871
Well, maybe a little.

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,439
What did you say to that daft judge?

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,750
I told him I was guilty as sin.

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,594
And he let you off?
Pleads a great case for judicial reform.

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,434
Yeah. Another repeat offender
returned to decent society.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,190
This is Garda detective Chris Mulligan.
Please leave a message.

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,398
You didn't get me this time, Chris.
Still got the wheels.

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,314
I was fined - you're gonna love this -
100 quid. Can you believe it?

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,439
You owe me lunch. You said wherever
I want, and I'm expensive, don't forget.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,592
Veronica?

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,754
Veronica?

43
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,348
The fucking eagle has landed.

44
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,879
How are you, boss?

45
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,515
Push off, you little scum.

46
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,597
Come on, get your money ready. £5.

47
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,031
How are you?

48
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,830
The name's Veronica.
I write for the Sunday Independent.

49
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,999
May I ask you some questions?
D'you mind?

50
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,198
How much d'you pay for one of those?

51
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,718
A few quid. Anyway, it's cheaper
to rent someone else's needle.

52
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,711
What about the score?

53
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,472
- First one's free.
- Well, I heard £5.

54
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,228
- Where d'you get the cash for all this?
- I just say to some broad like you:

55
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,871
"Give me your money
or I'll inject you with AIDS."

56
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,190
- How old are you?
- What's it to you?

57
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,396
I'm writing a piece for the paper.
I wanna know where you get the gear.

58
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,793
I'll do your work for you.
Come back when you got some money.

59
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,514
- Fatso, don't be spending that on food.
- I'll check it later.

60
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,115
- Lost, are we?
- Who might you be?

61
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,909
- Neighbourhood watch.
- Yeah, well, better keep an eye out.

62
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,390
I hear there's some dodgy scangers about.

63
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,155
I fucking swear to God...

64
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,038
Ah, Jamey, Jamey, Jamey, Jamey.

65
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,036
You're an awful man, do you know that?

66
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,318
What'd you have to go and shoot
your mouth off to the Gards about me for?

67
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,995
Did you think I wouldn't find out it was you?

68
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,548
You know, I was thinking about killing you.

69
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,758
And then I thought to myself,
people get killed every day,

70
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,115
and nobody gives a shite.

71
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,636
So I've decided
I'm going to have to hurt you a bit.

72
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,110
Actually, I'm going to hurt you an awful lot.

73
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,233
But the good news is that I'm going to
do you meself. Oh, yeah. Personally.

74
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,709
I mean, you don't want people thinking,

75
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,395
just because I got me name
in the papers and all that,

76
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,635
that Martin Cahill is too posh to do
his own dirty work, now, do you, huh?

77
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,230
For fuck's sake...

78
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,959
Take the gag out of his mouth.

79
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,558
Let the little scumbag squeal.
It's what he's good at, isn't it? Squeal!

80
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,031
Please...

81
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,671
- I'm sorry!
- How are you?

82
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,108
- You made lunch. Aren't you great?
- I must be.

83
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,997
- Hi.
- Hi, Jimmy.

84
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,072
Off to a big news story, are we?

85
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,869
Come on, Ronnie. Give us a scoop.
Who's the scumbag of the week?

86
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,669
Go and buy the paper, little brother.
You ready for me?

87
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,753
- Did I say something?
- Don't look at me. She's your sister.

88
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,149
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

89
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,119
Night. Night, darling.
I'm in the other room if you need me.

90
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,430
OK.

91
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,875
He won't have any trouble sleeping tonight.

92
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,554
That's cos you wore him out
on the football pitch.

93
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,631
Yeah.

94
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,391
- What's up?
- Nothing.

95
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,594
Nothing or something?

96
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,035
It's bollocks, what I'm writing.

97
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,352
- Give yourself a bit of credit for a change.
- Whatever. So it's half-decent bollocks.

98
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,273
It's light. It's human interest.

99
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,351
It's bollocks.

100
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,556
What a state, on the street.
There were needles everywhere.

101
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,473
- Right where the kids were playing.
- Jesus.

102
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,953
You should have seen these wankers.
Standing there with their new Mercedes.

103
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,715
How many £5 hits of dope do you need
to shift in order to buy a new Mercedes?

104
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,997
Do the math. How many kids is that?

105
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,837
Nobody's writing about it. Nobody cares.

106
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,798
Somebody needs
to get after these bastards.

107
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,352
They're making megabucks.
That's what I should be writing about.

108
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,989
That wouldn't be bollocks.

109
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,838
The pushers are using the underage kids
to do their business.

110
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,879
They know the Gards won't touch the kids.
Everyone knows what goes on here.

111
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,999
Eight kids from this block alone
died from drugs last year. Eight.

112
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,072
All of them under 15.
Four of them were me sister Iris's kids.

113
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,479
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

114
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,518
TDs, Gards, close their eyes,
call it a family problem.

115
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,989
But for some families
these kids are dead already.

116
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,517
So we formed Concerned Parents
Against Drugs, made it our problem.

117
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,670
I'd appreciate it if you'd write about us.

118
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,512
- How often do you march?
- Once a week.

119
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,433
- It's quite a commitment.
- It's quite a problem.

120
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,318
Hey. Do you remember me?

121
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,433
- Were those Cahill's lads in the van?
- What van?

122
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,714
She can help, Timmy.

123
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,712
You know, Martin Cahill. The General.

124
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,916
You know him?

125
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,149
What's your cut?

126
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,392
- I'd better go. I can't be seen with yous.
- Let us help you, Timmy.

127
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,711
I can find you a good place
to stay tonight. Tomorrow...

128
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,075
Do yous wanna have sex with me?

129
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,389
I'm not expensive.

130
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,272
- The bill, please.
- He nicked your wallet.

131
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,797
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

132
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,552
- When do we want them?
- Now!

133
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,232
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

134
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,993
- When do you want them?
- Now!

135
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,310
Are these marches always this small?

136
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,198
Hopefully, with your help,
the word'll get out to more people.

137
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,430
Yeah, hopefully.

138
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,080
I'll make sure it does.

139
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,550
- Get out, Mullen!
- You bastard, Tommy Mullen!

140
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,078
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

141
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,479
- When do we want them?
- Now!

142
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,198
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

143
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,759
- When do we want them?
- Now!

144
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,513
- Pusher, pusher, pusher!
- Out, out, out!

145
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,430
Look who's got hisself a new girlfriend.

146
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,870
- We'll see you there, then, John.
- Yeah, go on ahead.

147
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,272
- What the hell do you want?
- Is that any way to talk to a lady?

148
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,828
Ladies don't go calling
on gentleman unannounced.

149
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,911
So we're a gentleman now, are we?

150
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,356
Where's your manners?
You didn't introduce me to your friends.

151
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,398
- If that's what you're after.
- You closing up early?

152
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,040
One of the benefits of being self-employed.

153
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,558
You're amazing, John.
No, really, you're a model of... profitability.

154
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,599
How to succeed in business
without any customers.

155
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,511
- I do well enough.
- Yeah, well...

156
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,956
There must be a few bob
in those brothels there on Rathgar Road.

157
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
What they worth now, John?

158
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,196
- You're a dangerous little bitch.
- Ah, well. Do my best. Buy us a drink?

159
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,718
It's the benefit of being self-employed,
John. You are your own boss, aren't you?

160
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,078
You're way off the mark. Martin Cahill
isn't into the drugs. Neither am I.

161
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,991
You sure?

162
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,595
We're just ordinary, decent criminals.

163
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,911
If you're not going to take my word for it,
why don't you ask Martin?

164
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,393
- He's very fond of the ladies.
- Yeah, exactly. So set it up for me.

165
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,958
Why are you chasing the drugs?
You should be after the pubs.

166
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,430
- They do more damage than the drugs.
- Yeah, right.

167
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,714
Yeah?

168
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,031
No. I tried that. It was a dead end.

169
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,792
Call you back? Grand.

170
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,478
So how many guys
are you working for stories at once?

171
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,318
A less generous person
might say you were ungrateful

172
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,630
for what I gave you already.

173
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,077
Stealing old paintings, kidnapping bankers'
families. You're above that now, are you?

174
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,833
I got you famous with those stories.

175
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,230
Yeah, you feed me superficial crap.

176
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,551
- I make you look good.
- Great picture.

177
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,316
Come on. I need your help to get to Cahill.
Write me a reference.

178
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,789
I'm late for an appointment.

179
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,470
Word of advice.
Stay away from Martin Cahill.

180
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,316
Sorry to disturb you.

181
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,837
Are you Mrs Cahill? Frances Cahill?

182
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,391
Right.

183
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,594
Are you Frances Cahill?

184
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,148
- I am.
- Hi. I'm Veronica.

185
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,119
- I'm a friend of John Traynor's.
- I know who you are.

186
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,749
Is your husband home?
I just want to ask him a favour.

187
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,753
Martin Cahill doesn't
do favours for journalists.

188
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,432
So piss off.

189
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,479
There's a rumour going about he's putting
drugs on the street. You got any comment?

190
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,758
I know he nailed a tout to the floor of a flat
the other day. Was it drug-related?

191
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,435
Look, I just want a brief comment.
Off the record.

192
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,317
I'll be out of your...

193
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,198
Mr Cahill! You couldn't
do me a favour, could you?

194
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,989
I need the names of those kids
who are selling drugs for you.

195
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,710
And I'll do you a favour. I won't write
what people are saying about you.

196
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,475
You know, that you're having kids
with your wife's sisters.

197
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,358
There's me number. Give me a call.

198
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,151
Cheers.

199
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,596
So, what can I do for you, Veronica?

200
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,796
How could you lose a body?

201
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,429
- That's just downright careless.
- You find some, you lose some.

202
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,715
It'll turn up. Those bodies always do.

203
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,791
So you gonna join those crying foul?

204
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,917
"More Garda incompetence.
Is this why we pay our taxes?"

205
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,949
Some might say it's incompetent, but
you could say it's that you're understaffed.

206
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,956
Your hands are tied. You couldn't maintain
24-hour surveillance on that murder site.

207
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,670
People should know that.
I mean, I think someone should write that.

208
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,673
And if someone did write that,
what would that someone want in return?

209
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,470
I talked to the couple you detained
after the weekend in Amsterdam.

210
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,680
Held for 48 hours cos they bought
nothing there but a box of condoms.

211
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,880
How does it feel to wait around for a mule
to shite out a condom full of drugs?

212
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,272
You and I both know that the courier's
the lowest man in the organisation.

213
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,558
Somewhere some Mr Big is sitting there,
laughing at you and your stool sample.

214
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,428
You can't touch him. I want -
we both want - to get Mr Untouchable.

215
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,511
What are you gonna do when you get him?

216
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,070
Your paper's so scared
that some big criminal is gonna sue them,

217
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,390
they employ more lawyers than journalists.

218
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,473
Well, I mean,
there's more than 300,000 people.

219
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,348
I don't want to blow my own trumpet,
but they know Martin Cahill's the General

220
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,512
because, you know,
of what I write in the Sunday Independent.

221
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,718
- At least they know what he's up to.
- Great, for your readers.

222
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,109
But does it help me
put him behind bars, does it?

223
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,158
We're on the same side, Chris.

224
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,232
Now, I trained as an accountant, right?

225
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,110
If I could have a look at these files,
then I could go after those other wankers.

226
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,475
Put some pressure on them.

227
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,551
Come on.

228
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,158
Go on.

229
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,554
Look, I've got some more packing to do.
I'll be back in an hour or so.

230
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,076
Looking forward to reading
someone's column on Sunday.

231
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,672
"For the Coach every day is lotto day."

232
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,871
"What others might earn in a decade,
he can conjure up in an afternoon."

233
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,636
"His Swiss scam was such a stroke,
a child of his remarkable ingenuity."

234
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,234
"The fruits of a complex fraud..."

235
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,390
- The Coach, boss.
- What?

236
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,995
Never knew you were
such a horse lover, John.

237
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,678
- What took you so long?
- The traffic.

238
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,230
Nothing to do with that woman
who writes for the Sunday Indo?

239
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,471
- Did the boys say something?
- That's not the question, Johnny.

240
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,915
The question is:
what did you say to that woman?

241
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,991
Nothing important.

242
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,590
She fancies me, so I humour her.

243
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,037
You know why I'm successful, Johnny?
I lead a quiet life.

244
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,159
Nobody knows what I'm doing,
and that's very good for business.

245
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,758
When you talk to that bitch and when she
writes about you, you feel like a movie star.

246
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,436
Don't think she doesn't know
how to use that, because she does.

247
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,435
You're not as smart as you think you are.
That makes you a liability.

248
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,596
Remember this. If that bitch
ever mentions my name, you pay.

249
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,870
You like playing the gangster, do you?

250
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,750
Do you? It makes you feel like a big man.
Does it make you feel like a big man?

251
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,675
How does it feel now?
Heap of shite! You heap of shite!

252
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,115
- John, please...
- You bunch of eejits.

253
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,354
Who's the fucking genius
messing with the gun around my horses?

254
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,911
You don't insult me boys, Gerry.
You leave that to me.

255
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,470
Unless you want
some of the same yourself.

256
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,308
Word of advice.
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

257
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,189
I called you here
cos we've got a debt to settle.

258
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,474
What debt?

259
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,599
Your man Martin Cahill thinks
over half a million quid is owed him.

260
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,389
I got him to loan us that money to start up
the operation. If he wants it back...

261
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,438
As far as I'm concerned
that money keeps moving forward.

262
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,594
He lent you the money when you were just
out of prison. Now he's down on his luck.

263
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,831
He can't shift the paintings
from the last job. They're too hot.

264
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,514
- Why don't you just pay him?
- No, no. You don't get it.

265
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,593
When a scumbag like Cahill is down
on his luck, you kick him in the bollocks.

266
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,036
Wouldn't try that with Martin Cahill.

267
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,793
Whose side are you on, Coach?

268
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,153
I just think we should make payment.

269
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,518
Don't you worry about it.
We're gonna make payment.

270
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,992
Jesus!

271
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,230
Are you people fucking insane?

272
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,153
For a few hundred grand,
you've murdered all of us.

273
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,037
I don't like your tone, Coach.

274
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,111
Maybe the Gards
don't know what you did

275
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,316
but if the rest of the Cahill mob find out,

276
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,837
they'll kill yous
and everyone you did business with.

277
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,993
The IRA has claimed responsibility
for the murder of Martin Cahill.

278
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,234
We are now doing everything in our power
to apprehend and identify the gunmen.

279
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,311
At the moment,
no progress has been made.

280
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,960
This isn't the first execution
we've seen all year.

281
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,235
What progress has been
made on other cases?

282
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,073
I cannot comment
on any other investigation at this time.

283
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,118
Why is progress never made
on any cases involving the IRA?

284
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,752
Cahill's family has stated that the General -
and I quote - "was not killed by the IRA,

285
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,435
but because someone saw how much
money he made and wanted to take over."

286
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,751
In your opinion,
could the murder be drug-related?

287
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,197
- You can't believe everything you hear.
- Neither can you, Des.

288
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,234
Look, Veronica, every journalist
sees a vast conspiracy in everything.

289
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,359
We haven't a fucking clue about anything.
We just don't know who killed Cahill.

290
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,468
Yeah, and you don't care, right? As long as
they kill each other, it's easier for all of you.

291
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,153
Here. Let's sort out the petty criminals first.

292
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,876
Those who loved Martin Cahill
feel a deep sense of loss and pain.

293
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,120
Violence can only lead to death,

294
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,037
because it's the way of hatred,
fear and revenge.

295
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,316
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name, thy kingdom come...

296
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,188
Nothing like a funeral
to bring out the competition, is there?

297
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,956
Look at Gerry Hutch there, all tearful.
Or should I say the Monk?

298
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,998
He's not bad-looking, for a monk.

299
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,753
The thing about monks,
though, is they're celibate.

300
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,831
Supposedly.

301
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,360
See those two there?
They're dealers, right?

302
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,035
Oh, yeah.
Fatso Mitchell and Tommy Mullen.

303
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,677
- Cahill wasn't running drugs.
- No?

304
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,232
I followed the money and it turns out
your man was absolutely broke.

305
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,959
- The family had to borrow 10,000 for this.
- Really?

306
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,077
- Didn't have the cash to run drugs.
- For fuck's sakes.

307
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,039
Will you look? The north side rivals
to pay their respects.

308
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,948
That's Brian Meehan there.

309
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,669
- The blond one?
- Yeah. Nasty little fucker.

310
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,151
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

311
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,516
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.

312
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,830
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

313
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:34,393
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

314
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,549
Yeah?

315
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,237
- The IRA didn't act alone.
- Tell me something I don't know.

316
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,916
- Where are you?
- Gerry Hutch ordered the hit on Cahill.

317
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,116
Hutch? Jesus, are you sure, now?

318
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,717
I was there.

319
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,471
She bought it.

320
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,111
Boohoo!

321
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,718
Boohoo!

322
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,031
Get out of here now
or I'll put you out of your misery.

323
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,315
OK. Let's bring him in.

324
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,190
Right, strip him and search him.

325
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,798
I'll get you. Your wife, your kids.
You think you're the big fella now?

326
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,634
You'll not be so big
the next time you meet me with a bally on.

327
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,191
Yeah? I'm trembling. We can do this
the hard way or the easy way. Your choice.

328
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,192
Let's do it the hard way, huh?

329
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,317
Do you like men with big cocks, do you?
D'you want that, do you?

330
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,393
Is she a lesbian, is she?
You fancy me arse, don't you? You pervert.

331
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,110
All right. Get your designer gear back on
and get the fuck out of my sight.

332
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,510
There's over £600 there.
You can keep that.

333
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,478
Yous fuckers need it more than I do.

334
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,074
Bunch of fucking eejits,
working and paying taxes.

335
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,517
D'you know what? I make more in a week
than yous fuckers earn in a month. Here.

336
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,512
That's more than you earn in a year.

337
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,596
Thanks. See you, guys. All the best.

338
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,671
See you soon, Brian.

339
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,235
I always like to go shopping after a funeral.

340
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,514
- What are you doing here?
- It's looking bad for you.

341
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,195
- People say you ordered the hit on Cahill.
- People can say what they like.

342
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,113
I was out of the country at the time.

343
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,558
Is that your response, Mr Hutch?
Or should I call you the Monk?

344
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,518
You're invading my privacy
and the privacy of my family.

345
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,276
So if you don't get the fuck off my property,
I'm gonna sue you and your fucking paper.

346
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,351
Now fuck off!

347
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,631
Can I quote you on that?

348
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,631
I can't talk to anyone right now.

349
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,518
It's Tony Gregory.
He's the MP for Dublin Central.

350
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,957
I know who he is. I still can't talk to him.
Tell him to call back later.

351
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,316
- You can tell him yourself.
- Hiya, Tony.

352
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,516
What is this shite?

353
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,114
It's Ireland's finest newspaper, Tony.

354
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,590
"Dublin city is currently
like a tinderbox just waiting to explode."

355
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,559
- This sounds like self-fulfilling prophecy.
- It's a source quote.

356
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,517
It's not me editorialising.

357
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,353
No north inner-city gang
was involved in Cahill's murder.

358
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,830
The gardai have photos of these gangs
and no witnesses identified them.

359
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,354
The only reason there isn't
a blood bath right now

360
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,908
is because the Cahills
didn't buy your story.

361
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,913
Now, as far as I am concerned,
this woman is reckless and inflammatory.

362
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,877
She treats rumour as fact.

363
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,793
And your newspaper is irresponsible
for publishing it.

364
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,795
Now, I expect to read my response
over my breakfast next Sunday.

365
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,675
- I did nothing wrong.
- I know. Did you corroborate your facts?

366
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,594
I was told by a source who's never
been wrong before. I didn't name Hutch.

367
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,559
I didn't even call him the Monk. I put it
to him. He said he was out of the country.

368
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,837
He said he would sue us,
but he didn't deny it.

369
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,037
- We know that.
- And the lawyers approved it, Aengus.

370
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,272
We don't doubt you, Veronica. It's Gregory.
He's a Member of Parliament for the area.

371
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,397
- He wants to have his say.
- I don't give a shite about that.

372
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,948
What about the source?
He won't go on record?

373
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,033
Course he won't. He's a criminal.
Jesus, this is like being a cop.

374
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,069
Worse. You can't get a search warrant or
a wiretap but you have to prove everything.

375
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,756
Yes. And you want to check
how reliable that source of yours is.

376
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,351
Is Traynor about?

377
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,195
- Jesus!
- Oh, sorry, John. Just a quick question.

378
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,671
You're not aiming to start a gang war,
are you, between the Cahills and Hutch?

379
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,797
- Jesus. She's famous.
- Shut up, you.

380
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,873
I have a feeling you've been feeding me
a line of shite about the Monk.

381
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,439
What are you talking about?

382
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,752
Get the south and north side gangs to kill
each other so someone else can take over.

383
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,515
You're talking out of your arse.
Get outta here. Unless you wanna join in.

384
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,558
You told me you were there, John.

385
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,633
- I've done you a lot of favours.
- I'm the one doing the favours.

386
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,508
I've done you the favours! Don't forget that.

387
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,070
I tell you what I know.
I don't tell you what to do with it.

388
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,038
You come in here calling me a fucking liar!

389
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,509
That's a bit of an overreaction there, John.

390
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,116
- Why don't you come and have a pint?
- Too many journalists for me.

391
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,590
You can't join a club
if you ignore the members, Veronica.

392
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,672
I know what they say about me:
no journalistic experience,

393
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,799
I'm exaggerating the drug problem,
my sources are unreliable, I can't spell.

394
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,509
- Pretty accurate.
- I know I'm no great writer.

395
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,672
Well, I think you're a poet, Veronica.

396
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,271
Go on. Go on, Cantona!

397
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,031
That's poetry.

398
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,189
- What's the score?
- Nothing-nothing.

399
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,308
Cantona's a fucking vacuum cleaner today,
man. It's unreal.

400
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,957
He's what you call a striker.
Number seven. Watch him.

401
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,315
A striker? What did you say his name was?

402
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,595
Eric Cantona.

403
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,672
Born 26th May 1966.
Led Man United to six cups.

404
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,558
Premier League footballer
of the year in '89. Is that him?

405
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,110
Well, fuck me pink. I think it is, yeah.
Fair play to you.

406
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,873
- I met him.
- You met Eric Cantona?

407
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,838
- What did he say to you?
- Doesn't matter. He's a genius.

408
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,388
He is a fucking genius, man. He's deadly.

409
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,476
Look at that.
I bet you any money the Monk done that.

410
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,553
Do you fancy going for a pint? There's
a great little pub down the road. Very quiet.

411
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,110
That's almost three million quid.

412
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,555
Where would you hide three million quid?

413
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,154
How could you find any fun
in hiding three million?

414
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,391
Wouldn't you be out on the town
spending it like a mad thing?

415
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,278
Yeah. That's exactly right.

416
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,197
- Good night. Thanks.
- So no pint, now?

417
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,196
Not a chance?

418
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,308
- Well done on the Brinks job, Gerry!
- What the fuck you doing following me?

419
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,949
- I'm gonna write about it.
- I don't give a bollocks what you write.

420
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,794
- What are you doing with the money?
- It's none of your business what I do.

421
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,438
There you go.

422
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,829
You know, I've forgotten my manners.

423
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,516
You've been to my home.
Maybe it's about fucking time I visit yours.

424
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,149
- Straight ahead, sir.
- Thanks. I'll see you again.

425
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,877
- Night, Ma.
- Night, love.

426
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,758
- What are you reading, Ma?
- Just some of me notes.

427
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,799
- On the bad guys?
- No. There's just one bad guy I'm after.

428
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,829
It's the one who's up way past his bedtime.
Now, let's go.

429
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,516
You're getting much too big for
your old ma. I'll have to read you a story.

430
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,111
Jesus.

431
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,231
What the hell was that?

432
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,709
- Stay there.
- All right.

433
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,238
That's great. Thank you.

434
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,152
Ronnie. We're all nervous.

435
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,276
Ma's nervous, I'm nervous.

436
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,158
Even Graham.
He just won't say anything about it.

437
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,276
Everyone knows
it's no use talking to you.

438
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,069
Jimmy, those people issue death threats
if their laundry's folded wrong.

439
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,754
Ma! Ma, where did you put the candles?

440
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,400
They're on top of the bread box!

441
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,231
Ah, right.
Besides, it's not the first.

442
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,949
You remember those religious fanatics
after the Bishop Casey story.

443
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,429
There's always someone.
You get used to them.

444
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,718
No, Ronnie, you get used to cold water,
not bullets. This is madness.

445
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,395
You'd do the same. If you saw those kids
on the street, you would do the same.

446
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,155
- Not if there was people shooting at me.
- Ma, look!

447
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,713
- Cathal, that's great! Who gave you that?
- You and Dad.

448
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,591
Yeah.

449
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,153
I am listening, actually. Whoever did it
made sure I was not in the room.

450
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,434
Could you do this? You're better at it.

451
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,478
- There's nothing to worry about.
- Nothing to worry about?

452
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,917
I'm the only Guerin in the phone book.
Who do you think they'll come after next?

453
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,151
Don't flatter yourself, little brother.

454
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,152
Are you going to dance on this
or are you gonna go fast on it?

455
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,028
- Here, give someone else a go.
- Give me a turn!

456
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,189
Are you coming to bed?

457
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,588
- What?
- I know you can hear me. Coming to bed?

458
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,432
I'll be along in a minute.

459
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,874
Fine. Suit yourself.

460
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,835
Turn it down. Turn it down!

461
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,432
Come on. I love it. I love my work.

462
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,910
I'm finally doing something
that can make a difference.

463
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,594
What am I gonna do with you?

464
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,078
- Oh, come on.
- No.

465
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,756
OK.

466
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,551
Come on, man.

467
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,352
Come on. Good boy!

468
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,111
Did we wake you up?

469
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,430
What can I say?
I don't think Gerry Hutch is into drugs.

470
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,592
The Brinks heist, probably.
But drugs is just not his scene.

471
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,797
I understand, but I've been
tracking his movements.

472
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,555
I just need to source the drugs.
The connection's easy. I need your help.

473
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,316
- I need you to stop coming to my office.
- He's got the money.

474
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,870
We're talking about a fella
with no visible source of income

475
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,554
who paid tax on £2 million last year.

476
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,438
It's laundered
through the government's tax amnesty.

477
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,559
- He's got too much money not to be into it.
- In your esteemed journalistic opinion.

478
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,394
I know you seized shipments from Cork.
It's coming from somewhere. Where?

479
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,359
We've impounded drugs from
Liverpool, Scotland, Amsterdam, Pakistan.

480
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,877
You're not the only one trying here, and
Hutch isn't the only one with dirty money.

481
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,838
- Who else you got?
- I could name you a dozen.

482
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,957
Here's the latest candidate,
just in from Interpol.

483
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,508
John Gilligan, one year
out of Portlaoise Prison.

484
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,909
Can you tell me
how this Ballyfermot lowlife

485
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,676
has £300,000 to launder in an Amsterdam
casino? You're the star journalist.

486
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,876
Gilligan. Certainly keeps a low profile.

487
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,075
Yeah?

488
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,674
Hi, Aengus. Yeah, can you hold?

489
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,557
- Can I...?
- Go on. It's a copy.

490
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,517
- Great.
- Just go.

491
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,591
I owe you lunch.

492
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,112
No, run the Brinks story.
Just hold off on the drugs claim.

493
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,510
What for? This stuff you sent is great.

494
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,797
Just give me 24 hours.
I got a tip. This could be big.

495
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,670
- I'm trusting you on this one, Veronica.
- Oh, aren't you great!

496
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,429
Nice tan there, John!

497
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,355
Hope there's no hard feelings between us.

498
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,912
I'm not one to take a bullet
through my window personally.

499
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,309
Get lost.

500
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,392
I told you to be careful
with the likes of Gerry Hutch.

501
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,792
But you didn't tell me
about a fella named Gilligan.

502
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,835
Who?

503
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,639
You provided him with a car
when he got out of prison.

504
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,234
John Gilligan. Do you want me to spell it?

505
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,676
I run a bleedin' garage.
I provide loads of cars to people.

506
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,513
Hardly gonna remember
every one of them, now, am I?

507
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,071
- Is that him there?
- Why should I give a shite?

508
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,075
No reason, really. Just the fella behind
the security guard looks a lot like you.

509
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,836
- Now, there's a coincidence.
- Where's his money coming from?

510
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,195
Is he providing
hash and heroin to Mitchell?

511
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,670
I can't help you, Veronica.
Don't know nothing about him.

512
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,558
If I hear of anything,
I'll let you know, OK? Molly!

513
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,633
You can keep the photo if you like.
It's a nice one of you. We got plenty.

514
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,192
- You sell horses yourself?
- I do.

515
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,398
- You have a number.
- I sell them on to Germany mostly.

516
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,109
Myself and Geraldine are planning
to make this the largest and finest

517
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,954
equestrian centre in all of Ireland.

518
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,237
Well, I must say the size is impressive.

519
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,117
Said the nun to the sailor.

520
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,957
How about an aperitif?
Some champers, caviar? It's all imported.

521
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,191
John and I have great plans for this place.

522
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,271
Hang on.

523
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,551
Hello?

524
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,868
- Hello?
- John...

525
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,316
You're breaking up there. Hello?

526
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,356
- It's Traynor.
- Johnny.

527
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,592
Listen, Veronica Guerin's got hold of
a photo of us in Amsterdam.

528
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,835
But, John, I swear I had nothing
to do with it. I never mentioned your name.

529
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,911
But she was asking about you.

530
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,950
Johnny, I told you before, if she so much
as mentions my fucking name, you pay.

531
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,195
Fucking eejits!

532
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,271
Fuck 'em!

533
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,351
Happy Christmas!

534
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,713
- Now, isn't this great?
- When's Mum coming here?

535
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,429
She'll be here soon.
We'll want something stronger than that.

536
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,715
Yeah? Ma, how are you?

537
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,997
- Happy Christmas, Ann. You look great.
- Happy Christmas.

538
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,789
- Where's your mum?
- You know her. Always going for the gold.

539
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,511
All right.

540
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,352
There's someone at the door, Ma.

541
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,830
My phone'll be on all night.
You can call me whenever you want.

542
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,912
I love you too. OK. Bye. Bye.

543
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,555
Yeah, all right, all right.

544
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,349
Veronica's been shot!

545
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,149
How are you?

546
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,435
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous.

547
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,990
- Look at you. For God's sake.
- Hey, Willy.

548
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,153
Can't find any sport on. Can you believe it?

549
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,949
...extensive investigations
into organised crime in Dublin...

550
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,476
Why do they always use
that brutal picture?

551
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,312
It was a very serious incident.

552
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,188
Veronica Guerin
is a very talented journalist.

553
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,159
An attack like this could be seen
as an attempt to muzzle her

554
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,995
because of certain publications
or articles she wrote.

555
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,277
This would be connected
with last month's £3 million robbery?

556
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,830
We all know who pulled that one,
don't we, Hutch? He threatened me.

557
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,469
Veronica, please, stop this.
Write about fashion, about football.

558
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,519
Write about anything you like, but stop this.
You don't have to do it any more.

559
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,515
I don't see myself covering the catwalks
or doing a gardening column, Aengus.

560
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,512
You've always wanted
to write about politics.

561
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,795
I am. Drugs are political.

562
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,713
What if I told you
I wouldn't publish your stuff any more?

563
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,597
But you never would tell me that.

564
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,399
For Christ's sake, there's no sport channel.

565
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,119
- We have to go.
- What kind of hospital is this?

566
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,668
Is this what we pay health insurance for?

567
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,433
- Where Cathal?
- He's at your sister's with your mum.

568
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,351
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

569
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,953
Right. We've just got you
24-hour police protection.

570
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,031
- OK?
- Grand.

571
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,631
What a way to spend Christmas Eve,
looking at the poxy box.

572
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,439
Mary Poppins. Gone with the Wind.

573
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,149
Next thing you know
it'll be A Wonderful fucking Life.

574
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,879
The doctor says it missed
the artery and the bone.

575
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,192
Point-blank range
with a.45, and this is all they could do.

576
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,748
- Where's Cathal? How is he?
- He's fine.

577
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,832
Where is he? Oh, yeah. He's with Mum.

578
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,832
- Yeah. He keeps asking for you.
- Yeah?

579
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,155
...shooting happened shortly after...
...investigations for the...

580
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,800
...warning from a crime gang.

581
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,151
You gonna stop this now?

582
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,635
Nan, look! It's Mum!

583
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,517
- Give me the keys.
- I know what I'm doing, Graham.

584
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,752
- They shot me cos I'm on the right track.
- Give me the keys, please.

585
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,400
- Thank you.
- Would you give me the keys?

586
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,232
No.

587
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,709
Look at the state of you.

588
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,040
Do you think I want to do this, do you?

589
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,078
I don't want to do it. I have to do it.

590
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,869
You're a journalist. You write.
You let the Gards look after this.

591
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,078
Oh, Graham, come off it. The Gards
can't do anything. They'll get away with it.

592
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,515
- 14 shootings in 14 months.
- You're one of them.

593
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,398
I know who the guys are.
Would you just give me the keys?

594
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,392
No. Tough shit.

595
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,074
Come on inside. Please.

596
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,596
They're not getting away with it.
I'll catch a cab, then.

597
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,671
Oh, for God's sake.

598
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,671
Ah, Jesus Christ.

599
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,108
Yeah, hi. It's Veronica Guerin. I'd like a...

600
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,112
Thank you. Come on. Get in.

601
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,878
- Who's driving?
- You can't drive with two good legs.

602
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,157
- You think I'll let you drive with one?
- That's low, that is.

603
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,189
- You drive like an old granny.
- Come on, Hopalong, get in.

604
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,396
Where is she going? She only got out
the hospital a couple of days ago.

605
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,471
I know.

606
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,791
You let me do it.

607
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,717
Look! Veronica Guerin.
Come here. Have a look.

608
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,791
Tommy Mullen?

609
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,438
Fatso Mitchell?

610
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,749
- Yeah.
- This is for you.

611
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,391
Get the fuck out of here. Here!

612
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,316
- Your column's upsetting me mother.
- Ah, you poor fella.

613
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,235
You think I'm a drug dealer, don't you?
Well, I'm no drug dealer.

614
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,996
I've seen family and friends dying
week in, week out because of 'em.

615
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,311
All right. Why did you shoot me?

616
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,311
No, I had nothing to do with shooting you.
I wouldn't have missed.

617
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,633
I'm telling you, he isn't here.

618
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,632
And I have to go. I'm busy.

619
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,439
- How old are you?
- None of your business.

620
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,512
Please, just give this to Traynor.

621
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,633
Are you gonna be OK?
I mean, your leg and all?

622
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,950
Yeah, I'm grand.

623
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,995
Are you gonna be all right?

624
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,231
And I thought... I mean, I've always
believed that... Well, I'm a journalist.

625
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,110
Nobody shoots the messenger.
I mean, a journalist doesn't get shot.

626
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,478
If the bullet had hit an artery,
you could have died.

627
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,233
So why do you do it?
Why do you take the risks?

628
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:43,714
Well, I'll give her this. It takes some balls
to shoot yourself in the leg for publicity.

629
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,236
- She should have shot herself in the balls.
- Bigger target.

630
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,632
- Shall we?
- Never liked this place anyway.

631
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:57,192
She can always use the insurance money
for a course in journalism.

632
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,193
Here. Check this out.

633
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,875
...bringing to the attention
of the public generally

634
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,988
a culture that exists in our society
that nobody knows anything about.

635
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,878
Your girlfriend's looking
very fucking healthy.

636
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,235
Too bad the moron you hired
shot her in the leg.

637
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,710
Now the whole country's watching her,
thanks to you.

638
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,349
She's a real martyr, thanks to you, Coach.

639
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,352
Saint Veronica of the Sunday Independent.

640
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,719
Relax, will you? She's convinced
it was Gerry Hutch that done it.

641
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,394
You better pray she stays that way.

642
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,596
Come on.

643
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,035
Champagne - now.

644
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,238
These letters that you delivered.
What did you say in them?

645
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,914
There was one simple question
on each of the letters,

646
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,993
and it was
"Were you responsible for my attack?"

647
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,071
Mr Gregory?

648
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,073
What are you doing here? How did you get
past Security? You can't just barge in.

649
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,038
I'm sorry. Do you mind if I sit down?

650
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,789
A young woman wounded, on a crutch.
I'd be at a disadvantage. Take a seat.

651
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,156
I've come to apologise,
if I've got it all wrong.

652
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,630
All of you journalists have got it wrong.

653
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,960
You call these guys the Viper,
the Monk, the General.

654
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,270
You glorify them. They're not movie stars.

655
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,954
With respect, I've no option.

656
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,237
I can't name them.
Your libel laws won't let me.

657
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,880
Journalists are going to jail
for doing their job.

658
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,635
Liz Allen, she's facing imprisonment
for exposing these murderers.

659
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,439
I'm not getting involved
in your personal vendettas.

660
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,069
- I'm not here because I was shot.
- Now we know what you're not here for.

661
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,678
Look, I've been writing quite extensively,
in a balanced way, for the past 18 months.

662
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,993
You must have missed some of my articles.
On June 11th - I just want to clarify this -

663
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,550
I suggested extending
detention periods for drug offenders.

664
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,679
Then on July 16th I wrote about
tax officials - I mean, this is ridiculous -

665
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,593
saying that they are paid
only to record declared income,

666
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,353
not to worry about
whether it comes from drugs.

667
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,034
Then on July 23rd
I wrote about the gardai.

668
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,750
They can seize drug proceeds but can't
hold them. How frustrating is that?

669
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,958
I don't need you to tell me the fight against
drugs has been hampered, crippled,

670
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,600
by the laws that we have at the moment.

671
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,832
- We're on the same side, Mr Gregory.
- We're on the same side?

672
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,754
I don't like your methods,
and I do not like your paper.

673
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,231
Yeah. It's a rag. But it's a popular rag.

674
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,959
Use it. Get your message out. Use me.

675
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,032
You've got to change these laws
that favour the criminals.

676
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,874
When do we get to the part where
you use me? Or is this just a charity offer?

677
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,353
Well, I'm looking into a guy called Gilligan.
Just take my phone calls.

678
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,269
Gilligan, did you say?

679
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,796
Friend of mine said he rents these
containers out. Seen him about much?

680
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,997
Slightly overweight, like? Bald guy?

681
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,514
We've never seen him here.

682
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,068
- Thanks for the smoke.
- Yeah.

683
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:36,033
Willy, do me a favour, will you? Find out
how long Tony Gregory'll be in his office.

684
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,395
Hiya. Look, no offence,

685
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,917
but these guys are not gonna talk to me
with the cops hanging about. All right?

686
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,355
- Right.
- Thanks. It's not working.

687
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,036
Gilligan's listed here as living
in a council flat on the dole.

688
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,156
That's just a mailing address.

689
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,473
Those lads go to meetings with their
probation officers in BMWs and Mercedes.

690
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,950
Having money isn't a probation violation.

691
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,713
It is if the assets are illegal.

692
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,316
Now, then I'd like to see a register
of ownership for the following properties,

693
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,313
and this corporation here,
with a copy of the shareholders reports.

694
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,359
And the same for these other companies
run by a man named John Gilligan.

695
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,879
I told you, this office is closed for lunch,

696
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,635
so unless you're on staff or with
the government, it's always closed to you.

697
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,598
Not a problem. I've got a friend
who'd like to talk to you.

698
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,750
Do you know Tony Gregory?

699
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,714
Oh, you're an angel.

700
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,634
- I'm just finishing up.
- You're a bad liar.

701
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,870
Oh, God.
You make the worst cup of coffee.

702
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,350
Here. I'll help you put Cathal to bed.

703
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,829
He's been asleep for an hour.

704
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,071
Of course.

705
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:21,237
Don't you ever just wanna keep him
in the house? Not let him out ever?

706
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,790
Yeah. But mostly I feel that way about you.

707
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,795
I've got him, Graham. I've got his name.

708
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,150
I'm gonna get this Gilligan bastard.

709
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,437
I am so close, you know. I'm this close.

710
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,154
Do you trust me?

711
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,673
Right?

712
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,751
Don't worry.

713
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,429
Easy for you to say.

714
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,309
How are you? Do you know
where I might find Mr Gilligan?

715
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,198
- Sorry. Don't know.
- Right.

716
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,790
Mr Gilligan? I'm Veronica Guerin
from the Sunday Independent.

717
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,917
I've come to ask some questions
about your property ownership,

718
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,120
including this lovely
equestrian centre you've got here.

719
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,272
You could start by telling me
where you get the money.

720
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,513
Cunt! Cunt!

721
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,991
Cunt!

722
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,709
Cunt! Cunt!

723
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,591
- Are you wearing a wire?
- No! No!

724
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,748
Get off my property, you cunt!

725
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,515
Jesus! Jesus, what happened to you?

726
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,195
What happened to you, darling? God! God!

727
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,271
What happened to you?

728
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,598
Oh, my darling. Oh, my darling.

729
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,556
Can you see it all?

730
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,631
Right.

731
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,394
- Are you ready to go home?
- Yeah.

732
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,677
- You wanna try a drop of that?
- Thanks.

733
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,238
Look, it's up to you, Ronnie,

734
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,598
but if you do press charges,
writing their story might prejudice the case.

735
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,955
I know you. You just want to steal it.

736
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,508
Of course I do. I'm a reporter.

737
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:37,198
So what's it to be, Veronica? Do you want
the story or do you want to press charges?

738
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,671
Yeah?

739
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,191
This is John Gilligan.

740
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,669
If you do one thing on me,

741
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,312
if you go to the gardai or write about me,

742
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:18,319
I'm gonna kidnap your son
and I'm gonna ride him.

743
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,431
I'm gonna shoot you.

744
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,232
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

745
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:31,758
I'm gonna fucking kidnap your son
and I'm gonna ride him,

746
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,229
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

747
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,594
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

748
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,631
- Veronica.
- Where's Cathal?

749
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,233
- What's wrong?
- Where's Cathal?

750
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,278
He's in the country.
He's with your sister. He's safe.

751
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,351
Jesus.

752
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,475
- It was him.
- What?

753
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,758
I should never have gone there. Oh, Jesus!

754
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,231
- I'm so scared, Graham. I'm really scared.
- I know, I know, I know.

755
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,515
It's going to be all right.

756
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,715
- I want you to promise me something.
- What?

757
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,993
- Don't tell anyone I was like this.
- What?

758
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,275
All right?

759
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,796
- I don't want them to have it.
- All right.

760
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,394
That's what they want more than anything.

761
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,552
I promise you. You were never afraid.

762
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,518
All right. Oh, Jesus.

763
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,591
Never afraid.

764
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,558
Jesus, Veronica. Look at you.

765
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,710
I'll live.

766
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,836
How are you, John?

767
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,356
It's... been a while.

768
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,431
I'm grand. Get you a drink?

769
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,750
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

770
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,832
So, what do you want to talk about?

771
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:30,917
- I've a message for you from John Gilligan.
- The man you don't know.

772
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,870
As soon as I heard, I went to see him.
I told him he'd got it all wrong.

773
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,679
He's a small man with a chip. You know.

774
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,752
He's got a temper. He just lost his head.

775
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,310
Anyway, he wants you to know
that he's sorry for what he done,

776
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,359
and for what he said
about your kid and the family.

777
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,829
He'd never do those things.

778
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,594
He wishes he could take it back.

779
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,678
Gilligan got you to feed me
that shite about Hutch.

780
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,436
Yeah. He murdered Cahill, stepped back
and let the IRA take credit.

781
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,672
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm here because he wants this to end

782
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,035
before things get any worse.

783
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,429
How can it get any worse?

784
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,990
Things can always get worse, Veronica.

785
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:29,478
Now, if you don't press charges,
you'll be £100,000 richer within an hour.

786
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,032
It's not enough. I want 300.

787
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,558
- I think I could get you that.
- Right.

788
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,313
You tell Gilligan that
he's not gonna be buying me off.

789
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,678
Nobody's trying to buy you off.
The man just wants to be fair, that's all.

790
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,320
Even if he's convicted,
all he'll get is six months.

791
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,109
Right, well, if he's not worried,
why is he prepared to pay so much?

792
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,397
Why did he bother sending a messenger?

793
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,795
You're not the Coach at all,
are you, Johnny?

794
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,155
You're the ball boy.

795
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,631
What are you doing,
talking to her like this, after what you did?

796
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,553
What the fuck are you doing here?
Get out of here.

797
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,474
- He sent that man to shoot you.
- That's a load of bollocks.

798
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,994
- Don't listen to this junkie slag.
- It's true.

799
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,710
He said the man was supposed to shoot
you in the head, but the gun didn't work.

800
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,392
Veronica!

801
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,834
I've decided to make a formal complaint
against the guy who beat me.

802
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,835
I mean, I would... I would lose a lot,

803
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,277
right, if I was to give in to these thugs,
and I'm not going to be doing that,

804
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,715
because it'd be worse for me
and for journalism

805
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,634
if I or any journalist was to be intimidated.

806
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,631
That means they've won.

807
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,075
And they're not going to win.

808
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,515
Fuck off!

809
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,878
"The house shuddered and collapsed,

810
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,155
and then the little people discovered

811
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,518
that they were disappearing
into a swirl of leaves."

812
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,551
He's fast asleep.

813
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,790
Thanks for watching him, Ma.

814
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,237
What should a girl wear to court?
Maybe the navy.

815
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,718
- This one looks grand.
- Oh, look.

816
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,279
Ah, look at that.

817
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,678
Look at you always trying
to be better than the boys.

818
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,952
That reminds me, you know, of a day -
I don't know how old you were.

819
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,238
You were out playing football and the ball
went over the wall into Old Man Clancy's.

820
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,199
Do you remember him? He was
a very dangerous man. Very violent.

821
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,078
The boys did nothing,
but you, bold as brass,

822
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,517
you marched up those steps
and you just knocked on his door.

823
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,388
- Scared the bejasus out of me.
- You didn't show it.

824
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,359
That's your thing, isn't it?
You don't show your fear.

825
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:53,629
You know, Veronica, sometimes it's wiser
to let the crazy old man keep the ball.

826
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,918
It is, and sometimes
it's braver to just walk away.

827
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,151
Well, I got the ball back, didn't I?

828
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,038
You know exactly what I mean.

829
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:31,910
In response to a motion by the defence,
I'm granting an extension until June 30th.

830
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,231
- This hearing is adjourned.
- I'm sorry.

831
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,356
Hey. You haven't seen
the last of us, missis.

832
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,793
Cheers.

833
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,556
You all right?

834
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,279
I've got a speeding issue
to deal with tomorrow.

835
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,432
You're big in Naas. You haven't
bought off any judges, have you?

836
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,999
- Who is it?
- Ballaugh.

837
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,631
Can't help you. I hope you didn't take
what that junkie slag said seriously.

838
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,393
Her brain burned out months ago.

839
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,359
And you didn't call me here
to talk about a speeding ticket.

840
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,238
Changed your mind about Gilligan's offer?

841
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,198
I'm writing a story.
Just want to clear some things up.

842
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:49,432
- You're my man.
- What do you wanna know?

843
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,479
How you guys launder all the money
you're making from the drug deals.

844
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,757
- Is it the Amsterdam casinos?
- Are you saying I'm a drug dealer?

845
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:02,119
Would you talk straight to me? The two car
franchises, the yacht, the house, holidays.

846
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:06,637
All that comes from the brothels? Don't the
taxmen ask where the money comes from?

847
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,759
You think I'd threaten those tax fellas?
That's bullshit. I was with me accountant.

848
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:15,436
The taxman was very fair.
I'm legit. They can't touch me.

849
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,235
Who shot me, John?

850
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,157
- You know as well as I do, Veronica.
- Yeah. I need to hear it from you.

851
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,231
Gerry Hutch.

852
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:36,396
- Cos you're Gilligan's partner, right?
- Look, I'm a fairly minor player.

853
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,710
You've seen Gilligan's house.

854
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,078
He has a two or three million fucking horse
shed out the front that'll hold 8,000 people.

855
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,958
I'm not in his league.

856
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:50,909
So why are you asking me all
these questions? What's the story about?

857
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,991
You.

858
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,158
- Me?
- Yeah.

859
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,152
I'm gonna say you're a dealer,
name you, quote you on Hutch.

860
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,629
- You can't do that, Veronica.
- I think I can.

861
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,837
- You do that and I'm a fucking dead man.
- You poor fella.

862
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,595
Listen to me, Veronica,
I'm trying to fucking help you.

863
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,878
Take Gilligan's offer. I can't control him,
and you don't know how far he'll go

864
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,951
to keep from going back to prison.

865
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,429
I came with a photographer from the paper.

866
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,798
He's standing over there
next to the police. Smile.

867
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,556
Let go of my door, John.

868
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,430
Hello? Just a minute. Hello?

869
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,073
She'll be at the Naas Courthouse
tomorrow morning.

870
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,990
Come the fuck with me. Go on.

871
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,710
£100 fine.

872
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,111
Thank you.

873
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,232
Well done.

874
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,431
She's out.

875
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,075
Mum, I'm driving!
Can you believe it? He let me off.

876
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,436
He actually let me off.
I love you. Talk to you.

877
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,833
Yeah. Another repeat offender
returned to decent society.

878
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,915
She's on her way.

879
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,069
I told him I was guilty as sin.

880
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,431
Veronica?

881
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,236
Veronica?

882
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:15,388
Veronica Guerin's writing
turned the tide in the drug war.

883
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:19,473
Her murder galvanised Ireland into action.

884
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:23,792
Thousands of people took to the streets
in weekly anti-drug marches,

885
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:30,353
which drove the dealers out of Dublin
and forced the drug barons underground.

886
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:45,238
Within a week of her death, during
an emergency session of Parliament,

887
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,790
the government altered the constitution
of the Republic of Ireland

888
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:54,671
to allow the high court to freeze
the assets of suspected drug barons.

889
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:09,878
That same year, the Criminal
Assets Bureau, CAB, was formed

890
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,951
and given the power to access and seize

891
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:16,033
unexplained wealth
from suspected criminals.

892
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:35,318
Charles Bowden turned state's evidence
and became the first person in Irish history

893
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,871
to be entered into
the witness protection programme.

894
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,149
Brian Meehan was sentenced
to life imprisonment

895
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,231
for the murder of Veronica Guerin,

896
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,312
and his assets were seized by the CAB.

897
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,588
Eugene Holland was sentenced
to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking.

898
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,148
His assets were seized by CAB.

899
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,711
John Traynor escaped to Portugal

900
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,509
and continues to fight extradition
to Ireland on charges of murder.

901
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,592
His assets were seized by the CAB.

902
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,797
After a long extradition battle,

903
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,599
John Gilligan was brought back to Ireland
from England

904
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:44,468
and sentenced to
28 years in prison for drug trafficking.

905
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,028
His assets were seized by CAB.

906
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,711
Everyone in the Republic of Ireland
remembers where they were

907
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:14,511
when they heard that Veronica Guerin
had been murdered on the Naas Road.
