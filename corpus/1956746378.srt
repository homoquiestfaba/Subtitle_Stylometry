Nothing, he hasn't called yet.
No messages nothing, so he
hasn't called

252
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,348
What time did the guy say he was
going to call?

253
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,224
Sometime this evening.

254
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,433
this evening our time? LA time?

255
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,644
could be their time it could be
our time

256
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,647
So the last time you talked to
him, he said he was going to
talk to Zoro and Zoro

257
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,649

right?

258
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,775

259
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,859
yes he was

260
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,736
he was positive

261
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,447
totally positive. I don't see
why this thing is not going to
go through

262
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,782
I don't know anybody here

263
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,200

264
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,244

you said 200million thats what
am counting on

268
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,007
I didn't feel it was in my
position to put them on the spot
to have them commit to a figure

269
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,801
so that means that someone

270
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:28,808
take your shoes off, take
them off

271
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,311

stoop This is a party Please
excuse us

291
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,781
please sit down

292
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,367
I was thinking of going up to
the roof, it's a nice spot

293
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,660
smoke some pot?

294
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,661
Exactly,

295
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,455
Hell yeah

296
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:37,668
ones its party time There are
this 4 guys named jack.

297
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,670
again?

298
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,757
and they were going to break
into a building, so they all
rented a helicopter

299
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:47,970
to land on the roof of the
building and they all said they
would split up that

300
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,850
way they could cover the house
easier. So the first Jack
decided he was going to the basement,

301
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,354
he is the one trying the fancy
wines than the wine cellar.

302
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:01,442
And then the next jack said he
was going to take the first
floor so he could get

303
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:07,907
the TV and the VCR and stuffs
like that and the 3rd jack said
he was going to take the

304
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,245
upstairs bedroom cause that's
where all the jewelry is. And
the last jack said,

305
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:17,583
am going to stand on the roof
and make sure the cops don't
come and catch us

306
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,586
can you just relax can't waith
to get away from all these
people

307
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,588
Ooh my God I cant wait

308
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,218
So, sure enough, the cops came
along So they all came up to the
roof so

309
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:39,438
that all of the Jacks, get away
from the cops and pull off the
perfect crime

310
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,025
That's was a little bit scary
Ahah,

311
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:49,240
I think we are stuck

312
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,413
Good lord, that's great but I
think

313
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,624
no its magic

314
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:05,715
well we've got alarm buttons
that dont work, they don't phone
jack, they don't phone me

315
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,633
The only thing that seems to
work is the light

316
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,430
Would you really?would you? You
want to go at it ? You want to
go for that bastard?

317
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,143
Oh, there is a camera up there

00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,277
We are stuck in the elevator

321
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,070
Make the elevator go up

322
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,075
Open the door of the elevator

323
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,076
How is it going?

324
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,286
Fine huh

325
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,998
yeah Nice night huh?

326
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,291

329
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,349
This is kind of like a second
home to me

330
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,183
This place?

331
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,267
Yeah yeah

332
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,019
I have never seen anything like
this

333
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,939
I went to the university for
philosophy, which I found again
am here

334
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:07,276
I found it is a pretty much
useless degree

335
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,614
I would like to regulations
we wouldnt probably be-- I

336
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,621
we were talking about the
grands its like we don't have
enough pipeline You know what energy is?

337
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:23,251
Energy is That's
energy

338
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:30,258
Why don't we just relax and make
the best of it

339
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,011
okay

340
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:40,226
Make the best of it, best this
is the best, party of the year

341
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:44,021
Why don't we just relax a little

342
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,107
How much pot do you have?

343
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:51,404
It turned out that the oil and
gas industry was in desperate
need of our services

344
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:57,868
because a lot of their wells
were in very remote locations 
and we have micro turbines

345
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,120
for them but

346
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,371
we could be side driven instead
of front driven

347
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:05,751
yes exactly but the thing they
also needed fuel for our our
turbines

348
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:11,966

flare the bad gas that comes out
of the wells it called

349
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,218
farting?

350
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,178

big things, like you know magic,

someone to fall in love with

365

I have been a democrat I mean

So, what was that about?

475
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:23,272
Its communication, you know we
don't communicate well He
doesn't get

476
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:30,279
me, and I think he is just such
a ..he is not a sympathetic
person.

00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:36,201

Older sister younger child,

00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:53,927
To have greed is to have
ambition to want to succeed to
want to drive

482
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:59,183
the other guy in the back we
agreed--we agreed-- not to be
negative

483
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:06,440
Greed is more than just that
Greed is just got a bad press

484
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,610
Greed is taking more than you--I
dont think it is-- need

485
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,695
that is greed more than you need

486
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:16,575
there is more than I need I
don't think it is-- thatis
why

487
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:23,540
Our system is based on a lack
of powers

488
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:34,218

She did a nice job

504
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,914
since I met Bill my life took a
whole different direction,

505
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:07,960
I don't know about anybody else

506
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,839
My life would go whatever
direction to leave with Carol

507
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,340
Now my life is taking a
different direction

508
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,424
You are my dream

509
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,261
We all lost Bill when he met
Carol

510
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:21,181
I have to say that Bill
introduced me too late

511
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,558
In what way?

512
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,436
The first woman I went out with,
we double dated

513
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:30,524
with the same woman? Are you
going out with anyone now?

514
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:34,403
No I believe in catch you
release-- another change that
really is

515
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:40,200
Catch you catch you-- he olny
likes prostitutes-- He is open

very bad angry people really

01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:05,814
the California electricity
situation continues on day 152
of the so called

1257
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:10,861
crisis more rolling black outs
are expected here in LA as the
legislators

Sacramento.

Power companies executive and
energy brokers

1262
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:21,663
are likely to face a grilling by
law makers about charges price
gauging

1263
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:27,085
and manuplation but only if the
investigators have the right
question
