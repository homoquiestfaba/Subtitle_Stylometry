00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:48,783
[man] I don't even know
what she's looking for.

176
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:51,699
Please stay seated until
Mr. Keaton's ready for you.

177
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,833
[woman] Yes, he was in the office.
He was being sure.

178
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,141
[thunder crashes]

179
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,640
[dynamic music playing]

180
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,425
- [secretary] Hey!
- William Brody!

181
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,340
Okay. Temperature conversion,

182
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,908
it's in the packet,
it's important.

183
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,214
Make sure that y...

184
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,131
[dynamic music continues]

185
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,874
- What is that?
- It's Brody.

186
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,528
- Yeah, that's him.
- Oh, my gosh.

187
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,531
[indistinct chatter]

188
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,891
[thunder roars]

189
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,460
[whirring]

190
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,073
[male student] Does Brody think
he's Spider-Man?

191
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,467
[beeping]

192
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,605
[device powers down]

193
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,390
[thunder roars]

194
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,870
[student]
Why's he still up there?

195
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,176
[student 2] He's gonna
get hit by lightning.

196
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:19,570
- Oh, my God. Is he doing...
- [thunder roars]

197
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:24,357
[device whirrs]

198
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,795
- [girl] I told you he's crazy.
- He is so...

199
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,625
[thunder roars]

200
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,065
So you thought
it would be a good idea

201
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,111
to get up on the roof

202
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,417
in the middle of a thunderstorm,

203
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:44,464
turn this thing on
and see what happens?

204
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,074
It's what Dad did.

205
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,337
Dad didn't go to college.

206
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,949
It's just a microphone.

207
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,908
How would you know if it works?

208
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:56,215
I'm not going to be
the reason you get expelled.

209
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:58,826
College is your way out,
you understand?

210
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,785
Do you understand?

211
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:02,830
Will...

212
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:06,094
[footsteps receding]

213
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:08,444
- [door closes]
- For god's sake.

214
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,492
[dramatic music plays]

215
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,414
[engine revs]

216
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,505
[brakes squeal]

217
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,421
I can't do this.

218
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,336
[Harper] It's okay.
It's all about timing.

219
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,555
This is why people
have automatics.

220
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:33,993
Okay.

221
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,431
When I squeeze,

222
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,826
I want you to give it gas. Okay?

223
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,351
Yeah.

224
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,533
[gear shifts]

225
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:57,450
[engine revving]

226
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:01,107
[chuckles]
See? You did it.

227
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,543
[chuckles]

228
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,893
[William]
Whoa, we're moving. [chuckles]

229
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,416
- [Harper] We're moving. Okay.
- [William] Yeah.

230
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,549
- [Harper] Okay, nice and slow.
- [William laughs]

231
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,769
[Harper]
Turn, turn, turn...

232
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:19,167
- And come to a stop.
- [tire squeaks]

233
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,822
[William gasps]

234
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,086
It worked.

235
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,178
Can I ask you a question?

236
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:34,400
Who goes out onto a roof
to get close to the sky?

237
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:39,231
[engine rumbles]

238
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:43,279
Do you ever think about
where you go when you die?

239
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,893
[sighs deeply]

240
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,999
- [tires screech] - [William] This is
not stopping. This is not stopping!

241
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:00,513
Harper, I'm... I'm so sorry.

242
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,342
- Don't sweat it. It's okay.
- Shit.

243
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,175
You got a pen pal in Texas?

244
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:14,876
[soft music playing]

245
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:31,936
[sniffs]

246
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,182
Hey.

247
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,490
Come here. Check this out.

248
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,811
My dad was a genius.

249
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,602
She never understood him.

250
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:32,083
Maybe you don't understand her.

251
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:37,044
When I lost my mom...

252
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,743
that's when I realized how
important she was to my dad.

253
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,616
[door opens]

254
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:47,315
- [door closes]
- [Quinn] Hey! I have take-out.

255
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:50,013
Hey, hey.
Mom, did you know about this?

256
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,191
- He kept such detailed notes.
- Where did you get that?

257
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,671
Does it-does it matter? I mean,
you could use it for your research.

258
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,499
Harper. I think it's time
for Harper to go.

259
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,241
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no. No.

260
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,156
What are you so upset about?

261
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:04,506
This is the best chance I've
ever had at understanding Dad.

262
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,552
[Quinn] I loved your dad.

263
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:09,381
I miss him every bit
as much as you do, Will,

264
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,687
but that book,
that book is not for you.

265
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:13,648
- You are better than...
- Hey, hey, what the hell?

266
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:16,997
Better than what?

267
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,912
The man who got
all your research tested?

268
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:20,783
And that's why you gave up
on fieldwork, right?

269
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,350
Too much of a chicken shit
to put yourself in real danger?

270
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:25,180
No, Will. gave up fieldwork
to be your mother.

271
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,400
And sometimes
it's okay to be afraid

272
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,229
because I am standing
here and he's not.

273
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,406
When you do something you love,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

274
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:37,017
Yeah, yeah. I heard that before.

275
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,281
Thanks to you,
I have no idea who my dad was.

276
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:49,247
I think I'll leave, actually.

277
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,989
Oh... yeah.

278
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:58,169
[pensive music plays]

279
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:02,391
[car engine revs]

280
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:12,314
[music continues]

281
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,294
- [knocks on door]
- [Quinn] Will, honey?

282
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,254
Will, you awake?

283
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,344
Will?

284
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,574
[line rings]

285
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:57,837
[Will's phone rings]

286
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,319
Oh, for the love of God.

287
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:06,934
[dramatic music playing]

288
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,339
Thank you, sir.

289
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:52,588
[indistinct conversation
over radio]

290
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,255
[dog barks]

291
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:28,537
[wind chimes tinkling]

292
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:20,415
[car door opens]

293
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,246
[suspenseful music plays]

294
00:24:57,234 --> 00:25:02,501
[suspenseful music intensifies]

295
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:11,510
[gun cocks]

296
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:17,732
[Roy]
State your name and business.

297
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,343
Uncle Roy?

298
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:29,136
I knew I shouldn't have
put a return address.

299
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,790
Hey, wait!

300
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,879
How the hell did you
even get here anyway?

301
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,794
I just took a few...

302
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:40,712
And what in the world has that
woman been feeding you, huh?

303
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:44,238
You know what?
Never mind, the less know...

304
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,762
Let me guess, you came
to be a storm chaser

305
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:49,242
just like your dad.

306
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,157
No, I never
really thought about it.

307
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,725
Yeah, I bet you didn't.

308
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:57,467
Does your mom know you're here?

309
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:59,948
I'm guessing not.

310
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:02,864
She's the reason I'm here.

311
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:05,954
She really never
talks about him anymore.

312
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,565
So I started reading
through the journal...

313
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,175
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

314
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:11,481
The journal
wasn't an invitation.

315
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:14,833
I'm not your parent.
I'm not even really your uncle.

316
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,749
Your dad...

317
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:22,405
There was no one like him.

318
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:24,190
Never will be. Including you.

319
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:26,628
There. That's the speech.

320
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:36,899
She cleans houses, Roy.

321
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:42,035
The smartest woman
you've ever met cleans houses.

322
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:47,648
I can't babysit you, kid.
It is primetime storm season

323
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,999
and now I make a living
babysitting tourists,

324
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,914
and... and idiots.

325
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:56,265
Idiot tourists, worst of all.

326
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:59,269
But here, I'll tell you what.

327
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:04,970
Here. Ticket home, it's on me.

328
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,102
And then, if your mom asks,

329
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:11,672
here, you couldn't find me
or... or I'm dead.

330
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,327
You pick.

331
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:17,766
[engine starts]

332
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:38,090
[honks]

333
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:40,309
[door opens]

334
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,400
- [Roy] Van is way bigger than you.
- [William] Barely.

335
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:52,932
[dramatic music plays]

336
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:02,681
[sighs] Bill, your kid is here.

337
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,601
[Roy mutters indistinctly]

338
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:20,133
You so much as breathe on me,
I will shoot you.

339
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,793
Here, check this out.

340
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:32,840
[William] <i>Oh, wow.</i>

341
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,581
[Roy]
<i>All that heating at 90 degrees</i>

342
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:35,756
<i>cooking all that moisture.</i>

343
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,279
You can't get out of the pot.

344
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,761
Once that cap goes away,
it explodes.

345
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:44,810
Then you kick in
the low-level jet. Bingo.

346
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,202
What's this do?

347
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:50,902
[Roy] Well, police lights
for emergencies.

348
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:55,384
- Is it legal?
- No, not-not exactly.

349
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:58,126
[officer] Look, he's 16,
and he doesn't have his phone.

350
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,346
So I'm sure he's gonna
be back before dark.

351
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,000
If he ain't here by sundown,

352
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,871
then we'll officially designate
him a missing person.

353
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,568
Start an investigation.

354
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:08,310
So what am I supposed to do now?

355
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:09,965
[officer]
All you can do is wait.

356
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,319
[dramatic music playing]

357
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:47,046
[music swelling]

358
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,670
Son of a...

359
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,598
[vehicle approaches]

360
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,122
[man]
It's about damn time.

361
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:26,911
Hey, remember this.

362
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:29,827
Please, you are not
William Brody.

363
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,612
Not today. You stay put.

364
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:36,964
[car door opens, closes]

365
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:39,837
[Roy] Hi. Hey, good morning, everybody.

366
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,273
- Yeah. Good morning.
- Good morning. Finally.

367
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,057
[Roy] Uh-huh.
Good morning, Chuck.

368
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:47,018
Remember, today's the last day
to get your merchandise.

369
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,846
[Chuck[ Yeah, no thanks.
You guys charge too much.

370
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,412
[Roy] Oh, come on, Chuck.
We take cash.

371
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:53,633
- We take PayPal. We take...
- Are we gonna see a tornado?

372
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:56,288
[phone rings]

373
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,900
- Roy speaking. - [Quinn]
H<i>e's with you, isn't he?</i>

374
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:06,341
<i>- </i> Yeah.
<i>- </i> Where are you, Roy?

375
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:07,690
I'm getting in the car.

376
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:12,521
It's, uh...
it's our last day today, Quinn.

377
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:14,610
I'll... I'll get him home.

378
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:16,090
<i>Just know that he's safe, okay?</i>

379
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,397
There is no place in that
entire time zone

380
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:20,094
<i>that's safe this
time of year, Roy.</i>

381
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:21,617
<i>Where's the target?</i>

382
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:23,142
Call you back.

383
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:29,104
[intense music]

384
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,504
[Chuck] Take it from me.

385
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,941
Plan the wedding for winter.

386
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,595
Then your wife's happy

387
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:44,336
'cause you'll never risk
missing your anniversary

388
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:45,816
for chase season.

389
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:52,692
You lost?

390
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,955
That's my nephew.
He's just here for the night.

391
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,957
You're paying for his seat?

392
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,394
We're not running
a charity here.

393
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,788
Paperwork.

394
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,057
Just sign this.

395
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:13,756
It says consent of
the parent or guardian...

396
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:15,758
For god's sake,
just sign the damn thing.

397
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,501
He doesn't talk,
his name isn't on the manifest.

398
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:20,939
He was never here.

399
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:23,985
Let's go.

400
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,814
[clears throat]

401
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:32,732
[Zane]
Ladies and gentlemen,

402
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,255
please keep your arms
and your legs

403
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:35,474
inside the vehicle at all times.

404
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:36,824
Thank you.

405
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,000
Don't break anything.

406
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,610
[laughs]

407
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:44,396
You better buckle up.
We got an enhanced risk today.

408
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:46,225
So true.

409
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,794
[engine struggles]

410
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:57,192
[engine struggles]

411
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,241
[tapping]

412
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,592
[sighs]

413
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,596
He's not here, is he?

414
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:12,598
We... [clears throat]

415
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,253
Well, let me come with.
I can help.

416
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:18,909
You're a kid. Go home. No.

417
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:23,784
[engine struggles]

418
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,744
[engine stops]

419
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:30,312
[exhales]

420
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:37,145
[engine revs]

421
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,018
[tires squeal]

422
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:45,240
[dynamic music plays]

423
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:18,403
[Roy] How's Florida?

424
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:19,969
It's a whole place.

425
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,059
They get storms there, too.

426
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,713
- [William] Lightning capital of the world.
[chuckles] - [Chuck chuckles]

427
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:29,109
I wouldn't call them storms.
More like afternoon showers.

428
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,242
You're gonna get
an education today, kid.

429
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:34,027
[scoffs] Kid's probably forgot
more about meteorology

430
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,289
than you'll ever know.

431
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,986
- [Zane] Him?
- [Roy] Yeah.

432
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,901
All right, kid.

433
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:41,079
Explain to me where
we're going today and why.

434
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,646
May I?

435
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,522
[William] Judging from that,

436
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,915
dry line's
over the Texas Panhandle.

437
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,614
If dew points rise, converging
winds should set things off

438
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:56,919
in a few hours.

439
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,486
Should be an explosive day.

440
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:01,489
But, uh, I'm sure
you all knew that.

441
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,795
Kid's a genius.

442
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:05,102
[chuckles] Nice.

443
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,886
You want to bust my balls?

444
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:10,107
Let's try it again
when we're in chaos.

445
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,718
Finding the finger of God
inside of a target zone

446
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,155
over 100,000 miles...

447
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,635
that's what we do.

448
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,898
[Roy]
We do follow three rules.

449
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,595
Rule number one:

450
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:23,816
always make sure you got
at least a half a tank of gas.

451
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:27,298
Rule number two:
always, always, always

452
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,126
make sure you got an escape.

453
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,998
Generally, these storms
move to the east and the north.

454
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:34,000
Wait, why "generally?"

455
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,958
It's just typical.
It's not hard and fast.

456
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:39,440
The goal is to target
the southeast corner of a cell

457
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:41,094
and to lead it.

458
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:43,096
That way,
all you got to worry about

459
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:45,533
is driving east and south
to get out of its way.

460
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:47,492
Find yourself
having to improvise

461
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:49,885
and you're already in trouble.

462
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:51,539
So what's rule number three?

463
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,195
[ominous music plays]

464
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:58,198
Never get caught
in the Bear's Cage.

465
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:01,070
- Never get caught in the vault.
- [chuckles] Mm-hmm.

466
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:02,681
[Roy] The most violent tornadoes
are rain-wrapped.

467
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:04,552
You won't see nothing
until you're...

468
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:07,164
30 feet in the sky.

469
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,600
No, sir.

470
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:10,210
Your first time?

471
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:14,171
So, uh, what happens if you get
caught in the Bear's Cage?

472
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,173
You better find
a ditch or a pool.

473
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,610
Ha! Bring your sunblock
and your swim trunks,

474
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,265
if you dare.

475
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,443
[music intensifies]

476
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:32,580
Hey, chasin' is
90 percent driving

477
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:36,193
and 10 percent witnessing
the Creator's wrath.

478
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,195
I pride myself on
getting closer to the heat

479
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,719
than any other tour company.

480
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,243
When you kiss it
right on the mouth.

481
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,550
[chuckles]

482
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:01,261
So what's the deal
with the thing?

483
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,784
What thing?

484
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:05,787
It looked like a bomb.
Will took it up on the roof.

485
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,094
Not a bomb.

486
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:09,227
Not a bomb.

487
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:13,970
It can save lives.

488
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,326
So what's the deal
with you and Will?

489
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,720
He thought you were pretty
since the third grade.

490
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,245
[chuckles]

491
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:31,160
That's not it.

492
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,467
You treat him good.

493
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:39,779
I... I like the way
that he looks at the sky.

494
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:53,835
- It... it's fine.
- I...

495
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:55,315
If you're gonna smoke,
it's fine.

496
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,882
I'll save it or later.

497
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:58,101
[sighs]

498
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:10,592
[Roy] Cell's developing here
pretty quick.

499
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,989
It's telling me
it's ten miles out.

500
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,251
I can't see shit.

501
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,572
Just wait till
we clear the rocks.

502
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:24,997
Okay, once we clear the canyon,

503
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:27,217
that's when you're gonna
want to pull out your cameras.

504
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,571
Can I help you?

505
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:36,096
[engine revving]

506
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,324

[tires squeal]

508
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,850
What are you doing, boy?

509
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,330
It's absolutely massive.

510
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,202
Get back there
before it starts moving.

511
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:58,118
Like having a puppy in the car.

512
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,427
Do you want to get me fired?

513
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:07,997
God Almighty.

514
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:18,572
[indistinct chatter]

515
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:20,139
[Zane] Hey,
pull over here, right here.

516
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,794
You sure?
There's no pavement there.

517
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,622
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

518
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:26,972
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
- What, Frank? What are you gonna do?

519
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:28,365
[Frank]
Don't park in the grass.

520
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,410
Get off the grass, Zane.
You piece of shit.

521
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,673
Blow that out your ass, Frank.

522
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:34,372
[horses neighing]

523
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,907
Remember,
stay away from the road.

524
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:51,692
Stay tight as a group.
And when I say we go, we go.

525
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:55,566
And hey, [laughs]
enjoy the show.

526
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,132
Keep him on a leash.

527
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,440
[excited chatter]

528
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:07,840
- [car door closes]
- [man] Finally.

529
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:13,454
[sweeping music]

530
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:19,417
See how the anvil blasts
miles out over the horizon?

531
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:24,596
[wind blows]

532
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:31,907
You feel that?

533
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:36,477
That cool breeze?
You feel it?

534
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:42,003
Yeah, that's her outflow.

535
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:43,962
I don't remember them
being this big.

536
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:46,051
[scoffs]

537
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:49,010
Well, they get bigger.

538
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:53,014
You got yourself
a classic Supercell right there.

539
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:56,453
You can see her rotating from
the wall cloud below the base

540
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,847
all the way up her updraft.

541
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:03,938
Now... when the wind
turns warm from the back,

542
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:06,593
that's when she's feeding,

543
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:08,596
growing toward you.

544
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,469
I should have brought my phone.

545
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,601
[scoffs]

546
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:18,432
Hey, Chuck,
you're boning my shot.

547
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:29,529
[music intensifies]

548
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,793
Keep your eye on that funnel!
This thing is happening.

549
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:36,362
Right now, it's just a funnel.

550
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:37,799
But watch.

551
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:41,672
Watch. Watch the ground beneath.

552
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,979
Soon as you see
debris kick up...

553
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,288
you got yourself
a bona fide tornado.

554
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:51,509
[music swelling]

555
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:57,950
It's real.

556
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:01,475
Wow.

557
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:13,182
This is gonna buy me a Rolex.

558
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:17,621
Why aren't we closer?

559
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:19,927
We got the best seat
in the house.

560
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:24,671
Being in the front row
just gets you killed.

561
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:28,588
- [thunder crashes] - The cell
to the south is choking her off.

562
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:29,850
[whistles]

563
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:32,331
- [man 1] Come on.
- [man 2] Let's go!

564
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:34,725
- Let's go!
- Everybody in the van!

565
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:37,118
- Big winds on the way.
- [horses neighing]

566
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,818
[Roy]
Let's go! Let's go! Get in!

567
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:44,083
[man] God.

568
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,739
[engine starts]

569
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,918
Shit.

570
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:56,704
- [thunder rumbles] - [Roy] I'm gunning it.
It's not moving.

571
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:00,099
Give it a rest.

572
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:03,797
[emergency alarm beeping]

573
00:43:03,798 --> 00:43:06,540
Hail core's about
to pass overhead.

574
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,943
[thudding]

575
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,208
Two inches?

576
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:26,124
[thudding continues]

577
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,430
Three and a half.

578
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:30,650
[alarm beeping]

579
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:31,957
Is it bad?

580
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:35,351
It's real bad.

581
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,063
[intense thudding]

582
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:06,165
[thudding calms]

583
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,910
Everybody okay?

584
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:17,088
Is that a yes?!

585
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:19,438
- [Chuck] Yeah. We're okay.
- [whooping]

586
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:23,138
You just experienced
gorilla hail. Ha-ha.

587
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:28,142
You're welcome.

588
00:44:28,143 --> 00:44:30,667
- [car door opens]
- [whimpers]

589
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,583
[woman] Did you see
the size of the hail?

590
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:46,726
That's what we get
for going off the pavement.

591
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:49,598
Storage is just over
the state line from Shamrock.

592
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,426
[Roy] You want me
to get the other van?

593
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,254
[Zane] Try to catch us one more
chase before sundown.

594
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:55,735
Hey, listen,
I want to talk to you.

595
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:57,084
I think we can get
our money back.

596
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:59,173
Hey, don't even
think about it, Chuck.

597
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:00,392
You're not getting your money back.

598
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:02,307
You signed a waiver, remember?

599
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:04,136
Hey, was hat a tornado?

600
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,748
If it was,
we'd be deader than dead.

601
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:14,362
[Quinn] Yes, I know. So you
guys are still in Panhandle?

602
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:16,190
[Roy]
<i>We'll be in Liberal tonight.</i>

603
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:18,758
<i>- </i> Kansas?
<i>- </i> Yeah, that's the one.

604
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,935
[Quinn]
<i>I should be there by lunch.</i>

605
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:23,937
You're, uh...

606
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:26,723
you're not mad at me, are you?
He ambushed me.

607
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,769
[Quinn]
<i>You have my only kid, Roy.</i>

608
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,512
He doesn't know
how dangerous this world is.

609
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:35,993
He's in good hands.

610
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:38,082
[man] Damn, girl.
Where are you coming from?

611
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,737
Right. I'll be in touch.

612
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,740
Hey, buddy.
Hi. [chuckles]

613
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,350
If you want to hit on somebody,

614
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:46,873
why don't you hit on
someone your age, eh?

615
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:50,617
[chuckles] Yeah.
You got a smoke?

616
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,141
Oh, thanks, man.

617
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:55,578
Lighter.

618
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:00,452
Trade that.
Gentlemen shouldn't smoke.

619
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:04,151
I was just playing around.
Where are you going?

620
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:06,676
You ever been to Kansas,
Dorothy?

621
00:46:09,897 --> 00:46:12,291
[pensive music]

622
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:45,715
[pensive music continues]

623
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:56,596
[William]
Why didn't he listen to you?

624
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:00,556
Well, Zane's changed.

625
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:05,996
Every time you sell
one of those trucker hats

626
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:08,259
with our name on it,

627
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,651
does my mom get a cut?

628
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,958
[scoffs]

629
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,091
Yeah.

630
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:16,050
I already knew
the answer to that.

631
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:20,314
[Roy] You know...

632
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:22,708
one of the things
I loved most about your dad?

633
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:24,841
How he could...

634
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,278
He could look up at the sky
and know...

635
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:28,845
everything he needed to know.

636
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,718
He didn't need
some radar on his phone.

637
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:39,856
Nowadays, you download some app,

638
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:43,685
run a car,
you call yourself a chaser.

639
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:45,514
[William] What's that
got to do with anything?

640
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:48,821
[Roy]
Right after we lost your dad,

641
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:51,693
your mom was
forced to bankrupt the lab.

642
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:56,351
Brody Storm Labs eventually
became Brody Storm Tours...

643
00:47:57,831 --> 00:48:00,093
And here we are.

644
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:02,704
[William] What about Zane?

645
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:04,576
You really needed
that guy as a partner?

646
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:06,839
[laughs]

647
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,929
Do I look like a partner?

648
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:12,890
Huh? I'm an employee.

649
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:15,630
Hey...

650
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:17,328
I gotta eat.

651
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,677
So do we.

652
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:21,202
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
If it helps...

653
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,162
your name is
the only reason it's still here.

654
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:26,946
[dramatic music plays]

655
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,948
It has value.
It means something.

656
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:31,821
Yeah. That some crazy asshole
got two students killed.

657
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:39,917
We gotta go.

658
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,962
[sweeping music playing]

659
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:44,269

[music intensifies]

661
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:08,988
See that wall of cloud?

662
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,424
Wait, that one?

663
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:13,428
You dumb son of a bitch,
that one right there.

664
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,430
[man] Hurry up!

665
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:18,563
Round the place.

666
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:19,957
There's Cornshit.

667
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:24,134
Hurry up.

668
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:25,918
Get the mask.
Put them inside. Let's go.

669
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:27,964
[man 2]
Okay, all right. Start it up.

670
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,314
[Zane]
Took you long enough.

671
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:33,231
- Pulled a two-hour turn around.
- Okay, kid. Get out.

672
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:38,800
You change his diapers?

673
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:41,326
Chuck is really startin' to
piss me off this year.

674
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:54,556
[thunder rumbling]

675
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:08,656
- [bell jingles]
- [woman] Daphne, you hear me?

676
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:12,138
Put it down.
You don't need that.

677
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:15,534
You only get one.
You hear me? One.

678
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:32,246
[crowd clamoring]

[Zane]
That's us. Let's go.

683
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:52,135
Where's the kid?

684
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:54,050
- I don't know.
- We gotta go, man.

00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:46,886
[engine starts]

703
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:57,678
[man on radio]
<i>for potential shelter...</i>

704
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,506
[cashier] Don't worry.
If it was headed this way,

705
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:01,987
all those chasers
would still be here.

706
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:03,207
[bell chimes]

707
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:09,474
[wind blows]

708
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:30,581
[thunder rumbles]

709
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:32,017
[cashier] Lock that door.

710
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,672
Lock it.

711
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:50,732
[tornado siren blares]

712
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:57,174
Shelter.

713
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:04,005
[siren continues]

714
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:06,225
[dial tone]

715
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,967
This isn't a shelter.

716
00:53:11,797 --> 00:53:13,799
No, no, no!

717
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:17,194
[phone line beeps]

718
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:22,416
[grunts]

719
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:30,511
[line beeps]

720
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:42,958
[siren fades]

721
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,791
[woman] Yeah, he's in here.

722
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:52,402
[man] How many...

723
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:55,622
Your nephew's got a horseshoe
stuck up is ass.

724
00:53:55,623 --> 00:53:58,060
Probably make
the seven o'clock news.

725
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:02,020
That'd be good.

726
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:04,544
[tires screech]

727
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:06,981
We're here with the son of
the legendary Storm Chaser

728
00:54:06,982 --> 00:54:08,287
Bill Brody, who just survived

729
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:10,507
the Shamrock tornado
in a phone booth.

730
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:13,684
Tell us what
happened here today.

731
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:15,251
Well, yeah. Well, I-I was...

732
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,643
Hey, everybody. I'm Zane Rogers,

733
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:19,820
proud owner of
the Brody Storm Tours Company.

734
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:23,084
William Brody here is set to
join the family business and...

735
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:25,217
And carry on his father's work.
Am I right, son?

736
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:28,089
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, you're interrupting me.

737
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,961
You may have been able
to buy the Brody name,

738
00:54:29,962 --> 00:54:32,268
- but you will never be Bill Brody.
- Oh, really?

739
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,315
Aren't you the one that turned
his father into a hood ornament?

740
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,882
Yeah.

741
00:54:37,883 --> 00:54:40,145
We are the premier
tour company in this area.

742
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:41,494
Hope you realize
we've been doing this

743
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:43,453
for probably nigh on about 20...

744
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:45,151
- [grunts]
- [crowd gasps]

745
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,458
[grunts]

746
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:51,896
You can fire me now.

747
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:53,680
Hurry, hurry. Set up the shots.

748
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:55,726
- [camera shutters clicking]
- [man] Hold on. Hold on.

749
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:57,467
[man 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

750
00:54:57,468 --> 00:54:59,295
- [laughs]
- [man] Zoom in on him.

751
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,948
- Where the hell were you?
- Huh? What?

752
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,341
You know what I'm talking about.

753
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:03,734
Do you have any idea
how scared I was?

754
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:05,039
I just wanted some popcorn.

755
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,043
You think this is a game?
[grunts]

756
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:10,829
No.

757
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:17,356
Then why'd you send me this?

758
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:20,403
What? What use is it to me?

759
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,318
I thought it was a nice gesture.

760
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,972
No, that's bullshit.

761
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,499
No, you need me.

762
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,588
[scoffs]

763
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:33,895
The hell I do.
What do I need with a kid?

764
00:55:38,857 --> 00:55:40,075
I'll show you.

765
00:55:43,165 --> 00:55:45,298
[dynamic music plays]

766
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:53,132
I'll be damned.

767
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:56,569
She did it.

768
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,398
I got to charge it tonight, but...

769
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,444
I found it.

770
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:02,881
Found-found what?

771
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:08,060
[William]
Mom. She cracked it.

772
00:56:09,757 --> 00:56:11,323
All this time...

773
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:13,195
Now we can hear it
coming from miles away.

774
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:15,676
[sighs]

775
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,375
Wait.

776
00:56:20,115 --> 00:56:21,290
Hey.

777
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:26,513
- Wow.
- [Roy chuckles]

778
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:37,350
[music continues]

779
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:40,266
Go on. Get in.

780
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,467
I can almost smell him.

781
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:13,604
My dad, his hands were so big.

782
00:57:17,346 --> 00:57:19,784
I'd stare at them for hours
while he drove.

783
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:23,744
I'd wonder if mine
would look like that.

784
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:26,530
That's what makes you a man.

785
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:30,141
To be honest, Will,
I don't think that

786
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:31,535
has anything to do with it.

787
00:57:44,286 --> 00:57:45,897
Hey, slide over.

788
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,814
- Where are we going?
- Oh, you'll see.

789
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:54,295
[car approaching]

790
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:56,211
[thunder rumbling]

791
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:18,711
[Roy]
Keep your eyes on the radar.

792
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,061
I'll watch the road.

793
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:29,157
You got a girl?

794
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,597
Yeah? Is she cute?

795
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,207
She's smart.

796
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:37,514
That's what I like.

797
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,517
[Roy] Cute, too, bet.

798
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:43,823
Since the seventh grade.

799
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:46,174
[rain falls]

800
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:49,613
[thunder booms]

801
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:56,663
All right,
we're through it in no time.

802
00:58:57,882 --> 00:58:59,970
How long you two been dating?

803
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:01,276
I don't know.

804
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:04,323
We're just friends.

805
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:06,891
That won't keep.

806
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:10,329
You're a Brody.

807
00:59:15,116 --> 00:59:17,378
[engine stops]

808
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:20,208
All right. You ready?

809
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:26,127
[thunder rumbles]

810
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:40,577
Welcome to
the backside of a Supercell.

811
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:44,231
[clattering]

812
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:46,060
This is unbelievable.

813
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:55,330
[Roy] Hey.

814
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:19,050
You think
I'll ever see him again?

815
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:23,444
I mean...

816
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:25,578
when it's over for me, too.

817
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:28,625
Do you think so?

818
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:36,241
I'm not much of
the spiritual type. But...

819
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:39,592
I'll tell you what.

820
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,987
There was this, uh...

821
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:48,644
old lady in... in Shamrock.

822
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,648
Back in '77, and she told me...

823
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:54,867
she left for the bank one day,

824
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:59,219
and, um, she forgot her paycheck
on the dining room table.

825
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,789
That day, a tornado
took her home, everything,

826
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,183
everything was gone.

827
01:01:06,184 --> 01:01:10,188
The fridge had been tossed about
two miles on the other side of 1-40.

828
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:14,671
The only thing left standing...

829
01:01:16,411 --> 01:01:20,632
was that dining table,
with the check still on it.

830
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:22,026
[William chuckles]

831
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:27,160
[Roy] If there's
anything I've learned

832
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:28,859
from all of this, it's...

833
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:32,166
any law you got,

834
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:34,778
it will defy it.

835
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:41,872
So yeah.

836
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:47,051
Yeah, I think
you'll see your dad again.

837
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,271
Well, uh...

838
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:54,231
Mom won't be
cleaning houses much longer.

839
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:55,668
I'll make sure of that.

840
01:01:58,105 --> 01:02:02,543
[Roy] The sky will always show
you something you haven't seen.

841
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:05,069
It's why we feel the way we do
the morning of a chase.

842
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:09,073
For me...

843
01:02:10,596 --> 01:02:12,902
well, that's the end of it.

844
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:16,558
Well, I'm just getting started.

845
01:02:22,347 --> 01:02:25,089
[sweeping music]

846
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:30,006
Woo-hooo!

847
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:33,792
Whoo! Whooo!

848
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,839
- Whoo-hoo!
- [William laughs]

849
01:02:45,936 --> 01:02:50,069
You know, Will made me watch
every episode of <i>Storm Chasers.</i>

850
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,898
That must have been painful.

851
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:55,771
Why'd you let them film you?

852
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,773
Bill thought...

853
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,078
that if we raised our profile,

854
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:00,777
people would
open up their pocketbooks.

855
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:04,475
He was right.

856
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:06,956
You're lucky, Harper.

857
01:03:06,957 --> 01:03:09,350
Money solves a lot of problems.

858
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,267
If I could, I'd trade it all

859
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:15,835
for my dad to come
watch me play soccer.

860
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,453
You know, a long time ago,

861
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:29,457
Bill introduced me to the sky,
and I fell in love with him.

862
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:33,678
He also used my science in a
whole bunch of different ways

863
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:34,897
that nobody ever had
in the business.

864
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,420
I don't understand.

865
01:03:36,421 --> 01:03:39,293
You guys were the best at what
you did. How could...

866
01:03:57,311 --> 01:03:59,138
When you do something
as dangerous

867
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:02,707
as going into a place where
the wind that can throw your car

868
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,492
hundreds of yards,

869
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,104
every ride home,

870
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:11,585
you get little more numb.

871
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:13,284
So the next time you go back...

872
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:17,678
you want to go in further...

873
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,551
and you want to stay longer...

874
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:23,771
to satisfy some sort of...

875
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:26,166
<i>what, I don't know.</i>

876
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:33,870
If my grad student
hadn't taken a friend,

877
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:38,178
they'd be here.

878
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:41,789
If they would have loaded one

879
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:45,055
<i>50-pound probe into the truck
rather than two,</i>

880
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:47,752
they'd be here.

881
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:50,582
If they'd taken
Highway 44, they'd be here.

882
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:58,110
If they had been on
any other stretch of land

883
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,678
at that moment, they...

884
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:07,380
I used to think that the risk
that we took

885
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:09,557
had some
sort of calling because...

886
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:21,439
Because we chased
for knowledge...

887
01:05:22,614 --> 01:05:23,920
not thrill.

888
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:29,229
I guess Mother Nature
doesn't care. [chuckles]

889
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,801
Then why do it?

890
01:05:37,759 --> 01:05:40,718
Because somebody has to.

891
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:42,502
I just don't want it to be Will.

892
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:46,290
[tense music]

893
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:55,473
[Roy snoring]

894
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,785
[distant conversation]

895
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,658
[man laughs]

896
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:09,268
Dry line stalled.

897
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:11,183
Take a look at these
lapse rates for tomorrow.

898
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:12,968
Oh, you thinking about
Southwest Nebraska?

899
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,795
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

900
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:16,275
- Hey, bud.
- [William] Hey.

901
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:18,974
You chase today?

902
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,497
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
For the first time.

903
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:22,368
All right, hang on.
Give this kid a beer.

904
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:23,848
- Come on in, buddy.
- Sure.

905
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,893
[Martin] Yeah, first chase,
first beer, man.

906
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:27,025
Thanks, guys.

907
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:29,027
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

908
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:31,116
[Martin] You know about
the HRRR and the NAMNEST?

909
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:33,075
Um, yeah. Yeah, a little bit.

910
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,512
Okay. What about, uh,
what about CAPE values?

911
01:06:35,513 --> 01:06:36,992
Look, let me tell you.

912
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,777
Okay, so at about
a thousand CAPE, all right,

913
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:40,952
- you're gonna get thunderstorms.
- Mm-hmm.

914
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:42,214
It's as simple as that.

915
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:43,999
Today, the CAPE was 2,600

916
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,522
and you saw
what happened, right?

917
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:49,743
All right, now look at this.
At four p.m. tomorrow...

918
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:51,007
Six p.m.

919
01:06:52,356 --> 01:06:54,052
Eight p.m.

920
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:57,708
At eight p.m., Southwest
Nebraska is forecasted to see

921
01:06:57,709 --> 01:07:00,928
CAPE values between
4,500 and 5,000.

922
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:02,234
A loaded gun.

923
01:07:02,235 --> 01:07:04,497
That-that's good, right?

924
01:07:04,498 --> 01:07:07,718
Is it good? Son, those are
Wichita Fall numbers.

925
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:09,024
Yeah.

926
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,503
[Skip] The day Bill Brody
and those kids

927
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:12,505
became a missile.

928
01:07:12,506 --> 01:07:14,029
- [knocking on door]
- [Zane] Ding dong.

929
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,118
[Skip]
Mr. Brody Storm Tours himself!

930
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:18,120
Zane, kid here
popped his cherry today.

931
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:19,773
- [Zane] No shit.
- [Martin] Yup.

932
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:21,688
I'm so sorry, guys.
Thanks for the beer.

933
01:07:21,689 --> 01:07:23,516
Um, I... I should go.

934
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:25,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

935
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:29,044
You don't know who this is?

936
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,437
You're disrespecting
his old man?

937
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:34,398
This is Bill Brody's son!

938
01:07:35,442 --> 01:07:38,966
Wait, you're the kid?

939
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:42,275
I heard that you rode one out
in a phone booth.

940
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:46,192
Hey, your father's a legend.

941
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:53,069
This kid's parents are
the reason I started chasing.

942
01:07:54,026 --> 01:07:55,375
Did you know that?

943
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:58,029
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

944
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:00,162
[Skip] Wow.
The probes they engineered.

945
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:02,860
Yeah. They... they still hold
the record for most intercepts.

946
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:05,993
Boy, your mom has some brass.

947
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:07,560
We used to call her
the Mama Bear

948
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:10,085
because of all the time
she spent in that Bear's Cage.

949
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,608
[chuckles]

950
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,914
Nobody collects data there
unless it's by accident.

951
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:15,961
Yeah, except for the Brodys.

952
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,794
Bill Brody did things
nobody else dared to do

953
01:08:23,795 --> 01:08:25,839
and he did 'em again and again.

954
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,928
I mean, he pulled off
the moon landing

955
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:29,930
with nothing more than
a high school diploma.

956
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:33,151
Now how does somebody like that
ever get into money trouble?

957
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:35,284
I... I don't follow.

958
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:37,416
Science love scientists.

959
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:38,983
Even though
your dad had your mom,

960
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:40,593
he was always
gonna be an outsider.

961
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:43,683
People love labels. It's easier.

962
01:08:43,684 --> 01:08:45,250
To them, he was...

963
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:47,165
an adrenaline junkie.

964
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:49,472
- Just like the rest of us.
- Cheers.

965
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:51,301
- [men chuckle]
- Why can't you be both?

966
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:53,911
Well...

967
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:55,782
when you're ready
to prove them wrong,

968
01:08:55,783 --> 01:08:57,176
you know where to find me.

969
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,702
Anyway... [groans]

970
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:05,879
I need my hat here, boy.

971
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,274
I got me a van
full of new troops in the AM

972
01:09:09,275 --> 01:09:12,277
and I don't have
an effing driver. Gawd!

973
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:14,149
Ah, I should probably
head out too, guys.

974
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,412
All right, well, hey, boys.

975
01:09:16,413 --> 01:09:18,022
Y'all be safe tomorrow.

976
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:20,285
If those Southwesterlies
get backed by the southeast...

977
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:22,113
Wake up. Whoo!

978
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:23,680
Don't become friends with them.

979
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:26,335
They're gonna be dead
by the end of the month.

980
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:28,467
- [both chuckle]
- [Skip] Son of a bitch.

981
01:09:28,468 --> 01:09:29,687
[William] Hey.

982
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:31,689
Hey!

983
01:09:32,472 --> 01:09:33,517
Wait.

984
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:39,304
Why did you tel me all that?

985
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:41,438
I meant everything I said.

986
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:44,309
But there's a dark side to this,

987
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,529
and your father
crossed over from time to time.

988
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,095
Shit, we all have.

989
01:09:48,096 --> 01:09:51,143
But he never lost sight
of what was important.

990
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:57,367
Nice watch.

991
01:09:58,281 --> 01:09:59,717
Battle scars.

992
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:02,936
I dig it.

993
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:05,636
[soft music]

994
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:13,774
[birds chirping]

995
01:10:16,037 --> 01:10:17,908
[music continues]

996
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:19,519
[indistinct chatter]

997
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:31,357
[man]
We were all laughing.

998
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:36,144
[door opens]

999
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:40,278
[man] Hey.

1000
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:42,194
[crowd murmurs]

1001
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,676
[man]
That's Bill Brody's son.

1002
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,333
It's your fan club.

1003
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:55,380
What's happening?

1004
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:57,295
Ghost of a giant, kid.

1005
01:10:57,296 --> 01:10:58,776
Follow me.

1006
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:02,127
[applause]

1007
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:21,146
- Are you some sort of celebrity?
- [chuckles]

1008
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:27,369
So, what can I get you fellas?

1009
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:31,287
I am gonna have the world-famous
huevos rancheros, please.

1010
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:33,854
You know what?

1011
01:11:33,855 --> 01:11:35,769
Make it two.

1012
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:43,254
I hate to be a bother,
but how bad is it gonna get?

1013
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:44,690
Where do you live?

1014
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:47,084
Well, I'm just a couple
of miles down the road.

1015
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:49,521
But my sister lives up in Colby.

1016
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:51,523
- Does she have a shelter?
- Yes, sir.

1017
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:52,916
[Roy]
Tell her to stay near it.

1018
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,352
The storms are probably
going to clear

1019
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:56,921
to the northeast,
but best be safe.

1020
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:03,014
I used my dad's concept
as a guide.

1021
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:12,588
So, uh, when I reviewed
the models...

1022
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:14,633
- [woman] Hey, new reports out.
- [William] ...it all clicked.

1023
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,505
- [man] What does it say?
- [woman] Imperial, yeah.

1024
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:18,942
- [man] Oh, really? - [man 2]
Hey, hey, Southwest Nebraska.

1025
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,335
[man] Well, don't wait for us!
Let's go!

1026
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,858
[clamoring]

1027
01:12:21,859 --> 01:12:24,340
[suspenseful music]

1028
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:32,695
No, no, no.
Your mom is meeting us here.

1029
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:35,262
And she's on her way.
Until then, we stay put.

1030
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:37,569
How does she know where I was?

1031
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:40,311
You're my responsibility
until you become your mom's,

1032
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:42,880
so sit your ass down.

1033
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:46,230
[man]
Don't wait, bro. Let's go.

1034
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:47,841
Roy Cameron.

1035
01:12:50,627 --> 01:12:51,844
Just wait.

1036
01:12:51,845 --> 01:12:54,151
If you taste those
huevos rancheros,

1037
01:12:54,152 --> 01:12:55,805
it'll change your life.

1038
01:12:55,806 --> 01:12:59,112
[man] Hey, get outta there.
You're being a dick. Let's go.

1039
01:12:59,113 --> 01:13:01,376
[Zane]
You boys ready? Let's go.

1040
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,814
[music intensifies]

1041
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:10,428
Got a high roller today,
bought out the tour.

1042
01:13:10,429 --> 01:13:12,430
Can't afford to worry about
an intercept now.

1043
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:15,390
Just get me within range.
I need this.

1044
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,828
And think of the story;
it'll tell itself.

1045
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:21,091
Okay. The next few hours,
I'm God.

1046
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:23,528
Whatever I say goes. All right?

1047
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:26,009
Have you ever heard of
plausible deniability?

1048
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,358
Every day.

1049
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:29,055
- [bell jingles]
- I'm serious.

1050
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:30,927
If you're tired of
messing around,

1051
01:13:30,928 --> 01:13:32,625
being a tour operator...

1052
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:35,411
give me a call.

1053
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,677
- Say hi to Kim for me.
- I will.

1054
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,213
Not again.

1055
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:58,521
[dramatic music]

1056
01:14:24,024 --> 01:14:26,069
[thunder rumbling]

1057
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,941
[Zane] Mr. Khan,
you're in for a treat today.

1058
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:31,291
We've got the son of the
legendary Storm Chaser,

1059
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:33,206
Bill Brody,
riding along with us.

1060
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:36,645
[speaking in Hindi]

1061
01:14:36,646 --> 01:14:40,257
Big Bill. The Dalai Lama
of storm chasers.

1062
01:14:40,258 --> 01:14:44,522
[speaking in Hindi]

1063
01:14:44,523 --> 01:14:46,177
What did he say?

1064
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,570
You like history?

1065
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:49,875
[William] I love history.

1066
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:52,878
In 1949, a guy named
Dr. Horace Byers

1067
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:55,272
was hired by
the government to find out why

1068
01:14:55,273 --> 01:14:58,884
commercial airliners
were falling out of the sky.

1069
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:01,583
He got some fighter pilots
to fly their jets

1070
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,541
through thunderstorms
and they discovered

1071
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:06,501
that nearly all storms
are like lungs.

1072
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,721
One breath in, one breath out. Simple.

1073
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:12,420
But there was an outlier.

1074
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:15,510
Under the right conditions,

1075
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,077
there was a particular storm
that would rotate its rain

1076
01:15:18,078 --> 01:15:19,470
out of its throat,

1077
01:15:19,471 --> 01:15:22,517
allowing it
to breathe in and out...

1078
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,648
for hours.

1079
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:25,782
You know what he called it?

1080
01:15:27,435 --> 01:15:28,654
Supercell.

1081
01:15:31,788 --> 01:15:32,918
Good boy.

1082
01:15:32,919 --> 01:15:35,573

[bell jingles]

1085
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:54,462
[Quinn] Roy. Uh-huh.

1086
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:58,422
Hello, Roy.

1087
01:15:58,423 --> 01:16:00,817
- He abducted me.
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.

1088
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:03,559
You look...

1089
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:07,562
like a whole person still.

1090
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,867
Gee, thanks.

1091
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:10,216
Where's my son
before I castrate you?

1092
01:16:10,217 --> 01:16:11,740
Really? In front of the kid?

1093
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:13,220
I'm 17.

1094
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:17,441
You're the heartbreaker
since the seventh grade.

1095
01:16:17,442 --> 01:16:18,574
Where's my son, Roy?

1096
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:22,055
[nervous sigh]

1097
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:30,411

[radio static]

1099
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:44,121
[in Hindi] We haven't seen storm
as severe as this before.

01:16:51,824 --> 01:16:54,827

[device whirring]

1106
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:26,684
[Roy over radio]

1107
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,120
<i>You got William Brody with you?</i>

1108
01:17:28,121 --> 01:17:30,340
- [device beeps]
<i>- </i> [William] Shit.

1109
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:32,299
Hey, hey, hey. Careful.

1110
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,303
Put it back in the van.
Let's go.

1111
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:43,005
[dramatic music]

1112
01:17:43,006 --> 01:17:45,703
[tires screeching]

1113
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:47,270
[Quinn] can't believe it.

1114
01:17:47,271 --> 01:17:49,054
You're still pulling
the same shit

1115
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:50,360
that you did ten years ago?

1116
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:51,709
Why don't you just eliminate me?

1117
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:54,016
You're so good at
eliminating the Brodys.

1118
01:17:54,017 --> 01:17:55,713
You know, if it wasn't for me,

1119
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:58,934
Bill would have checked out
long before Wichita Falls.

1120
01:17:58,935 --> 01:18:00,805
I took on that man's load

1121
01:18:00,806 --> 01:18:03,678
while you stayed at home
playing keyboard cowboy!

1122
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,375
I was raising our son, Roy.

1123
01:18:05,376 --> 01:18:07,117
But I stayed here!

1124
01:18:07,987 --> 01:18:10,032
I was here...

1125
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,643
trying to... to
preserve something.

1126
01:18:12,644 --> 01:18:13,905
And I gotta tell you
something, Quinn.

1127
01:18:13,906 --> 01:18:15,777
Your son?

1128
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:17,866
He is one of us.

1129
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:20,956
You had no right to give him
that journal, Roy.

1130
01:18:20,957 --> 01:18:22,522
He loves you, Quinn,

1131
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:24,873
but you can't put a collar
on a no-collar dog

1132
01:18:24,874 --> 01:18:26,832
- and expect him to be happy.
- Hey!

1133
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:29,748
Shouldn't we be chasing?

1134
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:34,710
I'll drive my husband's truck.

1135
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:42,543

Buckle up. We're going to war.

1140

So exciting to be here.

1141
01:19:15,185 --> 01:19:17,013

1145
01:19:59,882 --> 01:20:02,274
I thought Imperial
was the target.

1146
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:04,842
Not for deployment.

1147
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:06,626
But we don't need to get close
with the microphone.

1148
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,890
The whole point is that we can
do it from a safe distance.

1149
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:11,545
Come on, son. We're cowboys,
just like your dad.

Find me an East route
or we're gonna lose it.

1158
01:21:37,153 --> 01:21:38,370
No, we're too close.

1159
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:40,896
We're not too close.
East route, now!

1160
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:47,249
[in Hindi] It's very bumpy.

1161
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,860
There's no pavement
for another two miles.

1162
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:51,557

Always follow the good air.

Get your phones ready.

1167
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:11,578

Our escape route
is around the bend,

1170
01:22:32,469 --> 01:22:34,687
about one mile. Highway 33.

1171
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:36,211

We're inside.

Major Tom, why don't you put
your headphones on

1175
01:22:46,048 --> 01:22:47,745
and find me a pulse.

1176
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:55,012
Don't be scared.

1177
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:58,015
We haven't lost anyone yet.

1178
01:22:58,016 --> 01:23:00,105
