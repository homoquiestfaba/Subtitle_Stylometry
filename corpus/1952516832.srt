All right, show me what else it can do.

Well, it's a de-particle-izer.

de-particle-izes things.

You're okay.

- Ha, ha!

- He de-particle-ized the senator.

690
00:41:34,444 --> 00:41:36,135
So much for government oversight.

691
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:39,053

to destroy planet Malgor?.

694

- Comet! Thank goodness.
- Little buddy.

700
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:09,615
Are you okay, kid?.

701
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,692
Uh, uh, not "kid." Uh, person.

702
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:13,489
N- Uh, tween. No. Chimp.

703
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:16,461
Did I just put my foot in my mouth?.
Tastes like hair.

Uh, are you all right?.

705

- I'm great. I'm on Malgor.
- Hi, Luna!

706
00:42:21,465 --> 00:42:23,638
Hi, Houston. Hello, Ham.

707
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:26,293
Hey, Kilowatt. Comet, my man.

708
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:28,370
Dude, I didn't think
you were ready for the cannon...

709
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:30,516
and now you're on an alien planet.

710
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,444
So, what's Malgor like this time of year?.

711
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:34,364
It's better than I ever dreamed about.

712
00:42:34,462 --> 00:42:37,015
How, why and when did you blast off?.

713
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,029
Yeah, about that.

714
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:43,415
I was just sitting in the rocket,
and the autopilot just took over.

715
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,463
Ah, but don't worry. Eveything's chill.

716
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,832
Chill?. You mean
the atmospheric temperature on Malgor is low?.

717
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,649
Oh, it's great here.
We're having so much fun.

718
00:42:51,748 --> 00:42:53,152
- Tell them about when-
- ( Laughing )

719
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,193
- when we were on the fluvian-
- And after l-

720
00:42:55,298 --> 00:42:58,114
and you almost fell off!

721
00:42:58,212 --> 00:43:00,635
Uh, do you have enough oxygen?.

722
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,320
Oh, wait. And you remember
when we were on the jump-shrooms?.

723
00:43:04,422 --> 00:43:07,522
Hey, come in, Comet. Whoa. What's wrong?.

724
00:43:07,623 --> 00:43:09,511
I think you have to be there.

725
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:11,747
- Hang tight, kid- uh, Comet.
- ( Laughing Continues )

726
00:43:11,848 --> 00:43:14,239
We'll get you home in one piece.

727

Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll fly back in a week.

728
00:43:16,873 --> 00:43:19,656
- Or three. Uh, T.T..F.N.
- ( Laughing )

729
00:43:19,754 --> 00:43:23,204
T.T..F.- What?. What's wrong with him?.

730
00:43:23,308 --> 00:43:27,565
Honey- ( Sniffles )
our teenager is growing up. ( Crying )

731
00:43:27,662 --> 00:43:29,702
It happened so fast.

732
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:31,662
Guess who I just ran into.

733
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,579
- Old Zartog.
- Huh?.

734
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,817
- ( Others ) Zartog?.
- Nice guy. I gave him a tour of the place.

735
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,285
Gave him Level 5 clearance
to Mission Control.

736
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:41,101
Oh, you should've been there.
It was hilarious.

737
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,384
He stole a device that de-particle-izes
matter, annihilated the senator...

738
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:50,225
and then announced plans
for the end of the Earth and Malgor.

739
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:52,624
Hi-larious!

740
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:54,798
- You did what?.
- ( Both ) He did what?.

741
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,308
I did what?.

742
00:43:56,405 --> 00:43:58,860
Luna, pull up the spy cam
in Mission Control.

743
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:01,105
Hit "Command Option 3."

744

( Growls )

745
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:11,762
- Holy cow!
- Titan, have you lost your marbles?.

746
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,990
- Now tell me how
to blow up a planet with this thing.
- ( Gasps )

747
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:19,512
Oh, no! What have I done?.

748
00:44:19,611 --> 00:44:22,546
Oh, not much- just gave Zartog
a way to destroy the entire planet.

749
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:25,107
I'm going to destroy Ham...

750
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:28,662
and all the rest of the hairy,
smelly little Earthlings.

751
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,865
I'm thinking our decision to bring
a Freznar-encased alien back to Earth-

752
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:33,374
big mistake!

753
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,407
Say good-bye, Earth nerds.

754
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:39,263
( Gibberish )

755
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:42,679
I know he's speaking alien,
but did he just call us nerds?.

756
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:46,332
I think, actually,
he said something about flour tortillas.

757
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,258
- Just a hunch.
- Hmm.

758
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:51,204
I thought he said, "Take me
to your all-you-can-eat ice-cream sundae bar."

( Gibberish )

and go to the bathroom.

762
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:02,788

We've got a tech problem
with that zapper...

775

our tech genius to fix it.

If Zartog's got some
sort of de-particle-izer...

782
00:45:52,404 --> 00:45:54,544
I could lose my friends forever.

783

Ham, Luna, Titan, Houston- everybody.

784
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:01,519
They could all disappear.

785
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:04,888
I could be their only hope.
I have to go back.

786
00:46:04,986 --> 00:46:08,335
I know. They're your friends,
and they need you.

787

I understand.

788
00:46:10,555 --> 00:46:12,443
You have to go.

- And I'm coming with you.
- You'd do that?.

790
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:19,507
Leave planet Malgor, your home?.

791

792
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:24,279
Actually, now that you mention it...

793
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,269
I almost crashed getting over here.

794
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,221
I could really use a copilot.

- Great.
- Wait. No. No.

796
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:33,400
What am I thinking?. I can't let you come.

797
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:35,393
This mission will be dangerous.

00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:38,009
If the hypertunnel doesn't kill us
and we don't crash...

799
00:46:38,114 --> 00:46:40,025
we'll still have to face Zartog.

800
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,018
- Am I your friend?.
- Yes.

801
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:44,572
And you're the best friend I've ever had.

802

Ah, never mind. What's the plan?.

828

Shouldn't the commander
technically come up with the plan?.

The commander who let Zartog take over?.

830
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:07,958
Yes, but if I hadn't
let Zartog take over...

831
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,264
then we wouldn't need
the aforementioned plan...

832

( Beeping )

1084
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,184
According to Einstein's theory...

1085
01:02:17,287 --> 01:02:18,946
you can double the particle velocity...

1086
01:02:19,048 --> 01:02:22,278

and reversing time.

Good work, buddy.

1094
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:42,412
Now that's what I call a magic trick.

1095
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,845

It seems we've been re-particle-ized.

1096

( Bob's Voice )
Your voice sounds very weird.

1097
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:48,650
( Senator's Voice )
Your voice sounds weird too.

1098
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,574

Their voices are mixed up.

1099
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:53,869
( Trilling ) I'm glad mine doesn't sound
like a girl's or something.

1100
01:02:53,969 --> 01:02:56,554
( Gasps )
Oh, no!

1101

( Shrieking )

1102
01:02:58,386 --> 01:03:01,322

1103
01:03:01,428 --> 01:03:03,317
- ( Beeping )
- Already on it.

1104
01:03:10,836 --> 01:03:12,494
( Normal Voice )
Testing, testing.

1105
01:03:12,597 --> 01:03:14,736
Oh. Now, that is more like it.

1106
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:17,589
I think the chimps just saved us.

1107
01:03:17,687 --> 01:03:21,201
Yes, and it appears he has just returned
from a second trip to Malgor...

1108
01:03:21,303 --> 01:03:22,710
with even more aliens.

1109
01:03:22,807 --> 01:03:26,071
Maybe the chimps should be
running the space agency instead of us.

1110
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:29,137
That would definitely
free up more time for romance.

1111

And ballet dancing.

1112
01:03:31,963 --> 01:03:36,121
Testing. One, two.
Testing. Testing. Okay.

1113
01:03:36,221 --> 01:03:41,175
Um, this project is officially... weird.

1114
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:43,801
The ray gun thingy is canceled.
All right?. Just cancel it.

1115
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:46,268
Just focus on the terraforming mission.

1116
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:48,222
And that's it. All right?.

1117
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,637
I'm going to eat an ice-cream sundae.

1118

Thank you. Good-bye.

1119
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:58,585
Comet, you saved us. You're a hero.

1120
01:03:58,689 --> 01:04:01,024
Can I call you "Captain Comet"?.

1121
01:04:01,122 --> 01:04:04,320
Yeah! Who flew to Malgor and back
all by himself?.

1122
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,723
- You.
- Well, not entirely.

1123
01:04:06,822 --> 01:04:10,467

from a very awesome copilot.

Really?. You want him back?.

1127
01:04:17,576 --> 01:04:20,643
Yeah. His toadlike ugliness and maniacal
pursuit of global domination...

1128
01:04:20,745 --> 01:04:22,753
was kind of entertaining.
( Chuckles )

Hmm. Maybe a teensy-tiny bit.
