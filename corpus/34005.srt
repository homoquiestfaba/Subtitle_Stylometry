Well, actually, thatmakes

360
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,373
Once upon a time,
there was a king who built a castle.

361
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:07,383
His name was Hugh Crain.

362
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:09,646
A hundred and thirtyyears ago,

363
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,281
towns like Concord and Manchester
were the center ofAmerican industry.

364
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,325
That's where Crain
made a fortune--

365
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:17,588
on the backs ofworkers
in his textile mills.

366
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:20,187
Now, this man could have
anything he wanted,

367
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:22,596
but what he wanted
more than anything...

368
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,601
was a house filled
with the laughter ofchildren.

369
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:28,070
That's why there are
all the carvings.

00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:39,282

Then, a fewyears later,
Rene, she passed away,

377
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:49,988
and Crain became
a total recluse.

378
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:53,997
But he kept on building,
adding room upon room.

379

that sometimes at night...

-Well, there are the stillborn children,

although I like to think
it was more sinister,

00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:35,242
like maybe Hugh Crain was
a horrible monster and drove her to it.

for the woman that he loved,

It was a tomb.

- Maybe he doesn't trust women.
