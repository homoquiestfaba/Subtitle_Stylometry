1
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:22,422
{\an9}<i>I never believed in
angels and fairytales,</i>

2
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:25,132
{\an9}<i>no matter how much
I wanted it,</i>

3
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,736
{\an9}<i>nothing I ever really
wished for came true.</i>

4
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,447
{\an9}<i>but I never
stopped wishing.</i>

5
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:35,625
<i>Maybe this Christmas
will be different.</i>

6
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:41,623
Alanna?

7
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:43,540
{\an3}- Coming.
- Ok.

8
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,632
{\an7}So sorry. I always take that
right as the door's starting to close.

9
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:08,567
{\an7}Could you hit three, please?

10
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:12,081
{\an7}That's the maternity
ward, my first grandchild.

11
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,646
Congratulations.

12
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:19,761
{\an7}Isn't that a perfect way to start the day?
A girl, eight pounds four ounces.

13
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:25,939
{\an9}Are you getting out?

14
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:28,466
No, not this one.

15
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,164
OK. This is us.

16
00:01:57,603 --> 00:02:00,234
{\an9}Hi, we're here to see
Berry Thompson.

17
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:03,548
{\an9}Thank you.

18
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,884
{\an9}You both keep holding your mama
while you're visiting. Real tight, ok?

19
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:09,267
{\an9}She's not our mother.

20
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:11,485
{\an9}Ok, there you go.

21
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,203
Come on.

22
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,450
- Did you bring me something?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

23
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:21,590
Mum needs a smoke.

24
00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:26,146
That's a good girl. Thanks honey.

25
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,061
Where did you get those?

26
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,743
That's a really great thing
to teach her.

27
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:37,372
Don't you start with me. I got enough
with these cops, doctors...

28
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:40,093
don't even begin to start.

29
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,886
Well, they say it's your life
so you could be a little nicer.

30
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:46,516
This is a jail Emilie.
Ok? I'm in jail.

31
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:01,395
JT, if you got something to say,
you say it to everybody, remember?

32
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:05,007
He doesn't like it here.

33
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,723
Smart kid.

34
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:13,575
Still carrying around your
baseball glove?

35
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,409
So what do you hear
from your lawyer?

36
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:29,416
Nobody tells me anything.

37
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,888
I mean do you know when you're
gonna get out again or even...

38
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:34,093
What, what, what!

39
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,456
Keep asking me a question,
keep asking me questions.

40
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:39,447
I don't know Emilie, I don't know.

41
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,576
You know what,
you've gotta get it together.

42
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,587
You can't do this over and over.

43
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,627
I know.

44
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,742
I am gonna get it together this time.

45
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,759
So give me a break,
I'm gonna do it for real.

46
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,580
I can't do this anymore.

47
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:09,735
You don't know how many times
I've heard you say that.

48
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:12,547
I mean how many times
have I dropped everything?

49
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,336
Driving all this way
to take care of the kids, to

50
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:17,980
bail you out.

51
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,562
All right, fine, if it's a problem,
just tell me, ok.

52
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:22,995
Yeah and then what?

53
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:27,871
Who's gonna take care of them?
If it's not me who?

54
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,379
I'm gonna go.

55
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,695
I don't feel so hot now.

56
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:39,367
Berry.

57
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:41,559
Well, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,973
Yeah? I'm sorry too, ok?
We're both sorry.

59
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,658
You guys hang tough.

60
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,085
- Eat something all right?
- Yeah.

61
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:56,494
- <i>You look really thin.</i>
- Well, yeah.

62
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,703
Hey, Lani?

63
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,744
Tell Jack I'm here, ok?

64
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,888
Ok?

65
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:11,702
Don't forget.

66
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,808
- Who's Jack?
- Nobody.

67
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:20,392
Her boyfriend?

68
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:23,084
He brings her drugs.

69
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:27,746
You two go stand over there
with that nice lady, ok?

70
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:31,610
What?

71
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:33,751
When are you gonna get it?

72
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,843
You almost OD'd this time.

73
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:37,999
You were dying when they
found you, you're own kids...

74
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:40,688
Don't you dare lecture me.

75
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,920
I don't need you to save me.

76
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,747
If you got a problem with this go back
to Atlanta. This is my life.

77
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:48,288
No, this is not your life,
this is their life.

78
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:50,672
Do you have any idea
what this is doing to them?

79
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:52,132
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:53,830
Yeah?

81
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,072
They survived didn't they?

82
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:00,082
We've been locked out of the
apartment. Did you know that?

83
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:02,975
You haven't paid the rent
in six months.

84
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:07,730
Times are tough,
or haven't you noticed?

85
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:12,957
Where do you suggest we stay tonight?

86
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,730
I mean where should we go to sleep?

87
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,982
You're their mother.

88
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:20,776
Give me a break.

89
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:25,928
Ok.

90
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:31,178
We'll be back tomorrow, so...

91
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:44,899
- And how old are you now JT?
- He's almost six.

92
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:48,286
- Hmm.
- Is there something I can do for you?

93
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:50,905
- Oh Miss Thompson, Emilie Thompson?
- Yes.

94
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,202
Ruth Doyle, Child Services.

95
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:55,337
She's scaring JT.

96
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:57,091
Honey, there's nothing
to be scared of.

97
00:06:57,091 --> 00:07:00,322
- He's afraid she's gonna take us away.
- That's not gonna happen.

98
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:03,775
Uh, look the last 24 hours
have really...

99
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:07,200
Let's talk privately for a moment,
shall we? Miss Russell can watch
the children for us.

100
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:10,959
Miss Russell, would you watch
Alanna and JT for a minute?

101
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:19,718
Hey, nobody is going to
take you away, ok?

102
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:23,338
I'm just going to go talk to her.
You stay with Alanna.

103
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:26,059
And we'll be fine, I promise.

104
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,606
Come on.

105
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,733
Foster care is in their best interest and
right now my concern is for the children.

106
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:41,690
They've missed school and healthy living
conditions, evictions, abandonment.

107
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:45,357
There's a history of neglect here
that borders on child abuse.

108
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:47,891
We feel that a foster home
would be a safer environment.

109
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:51,143
But I'm their aunt,
I'm here to take care of them.

110
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:54,017
Miss Thompson, I'm sure that you
mean well but you have no job here.

111
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,949
I'm gonna get one I'm going back
to school to be a nurse. I do that.

112
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,398
I'm sure that you will,

113
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,276
but right now you have no
permanent address,

114
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,340
you have no bank account,
no savings account...

115
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,357
But that's because I've given everything
I had to try to help these kids.

116
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,327
Yeah, and your sister spent it all
on boyfriend's and drugs.

117
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:11,708
Are you saying it'd be better
if I didn't try to help?

118
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,039
What I'm saying...

119
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:22,100
Look, what I'm saying to you is we're
dealing with a Rhode Island jurisdiction

120
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,627
and you have no history with us.

121
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:28,352
Well, I have a history with those
children, isn't that more important?

122
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:32,433
Miss Doyle. Ruth.

123
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:36,199
You can't give these kids to
strangers when I'm here now

124
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,794
ready to do
what needs to be done.

125
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:39,797
I'd really like to help you.

126
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:41,158
Then do it.

127
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:43,973
Well, if you can find a job, open a
bank account, establish yourself.

128
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,737
Alright, that takes time.

129
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,013
Exactly my point. Until then

130
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:50,080
I have superiors I have to report to
and guidelines that I have to work with.

131
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,863
Yeah, I know this system.

132
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:55,648
Berry and I were raised in it and
that is why I am begging you if...

133
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:59,843
That little boy, he doesn't even
talk anymore except to his sister.

134
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:03,956
If you split them up he does not
have a chance, he needs his family.

135
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,305
We make every attempt to keep
the siblings together.

136
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,700
But you can't promise.

137
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,124
No, no I can't.

138
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:14,790
Miss Doyle, do you have a minute?
I'm afraid it's urgent.

139
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,612
Yes, just a minute.

140
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:19,494
Look, for now this is
the best choice for everybody.

141
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:22,830
If you'd like to take the time
to explain it to them yourself

142
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:26,554
maybe the transition would be easier.
I'll be right back.

143
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:47,411
Hey. Take your brother's hand
come on, come with me.

144
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:49,602
Let's go.

145
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:56,628
- JT was right about the lady wasn't he?
- Keep walking.

146
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,419
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

147
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,443
Just get in the car, come on.

148
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:32,075
Not now.

149
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,210
Are we going to Atlanta?

150
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,637
Right now, it's anybody's guess.

151
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,261
Why didn't we stay on the highway?

152
00:10:56,285 --> 00:11:00,185
I thought you two would like to see
the countryside. Something pretty.

153
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,609
Is it because you thought
the police might be after us?

154
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,333
You're a little too smart
for your own good, you know that?

155
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,283
Are we lost?

156
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,507
No, we are not lost.

157
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:17,231
Just, uh,
don't know where we are.

158
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:35,819
Bethlehem. We couldn't be that lost.

159
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:00,796
Ok you guys, come on.

160
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,120
Are we there yet?

161
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:07,395
We're at a diner, we need to get some
directions, get some real food. OK?

162
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,219
<i>You two, you've got to
wake up for me.</i>

163
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,743
Come on JT.

164
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:16,535
Ok, here's the thing.
We've got $60 and some change

165
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,580
and it's gonna take us two nights
to get to Atlanta from here.

166
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:21,994
Will we have to sleep in the car?

167
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,318
<i>The car?</i>

168
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:26,686
How many times have you guys
had to sleep in the car?

169
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:27,706
<i>Some.</i>

170
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,005
It's okay for me but JT gets cold.

171
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:34,224
Oh, filthy no car,
can't be tonight. I'll say.

172
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:38,399
The temperature's dropping
like a barrel over Niagara.

173
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:43,486
High summer, ain't a better place
in the world to sleep.

174
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:47,524
In a 1950 DeSoto sportsman.

175
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:52,858
Parked high on a bluff,
windows down.

176
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:56,668
Sweet breezes blowin' in. Ah.

177
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:03,317
I used to be an adventurer
when I was your age.

178
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:06,727
- What's a DeSoto?
- It's a car, sweetheart.

179
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,469
A honey of a car.

180
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,986
Do you know a place we might
get a room for the night?

181
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:15,377
Oh, there's Holly McBride's Inn
over on Fielder's.

182
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,599
Big rooms...

183
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:19,522
fireplaces...

184
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:20,923
four posters!

185
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:25,165
We just need something,
uh, simple. A motel?

186
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:28,188
Oh, closest one is way out
on the highway,

187
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:31,179
40 or 50 miles of
back road to get there.

188
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,652
And even if you do...

189
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:36,476
they'll probably be full up.

190
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:40,232
But if you're gonna head
in that direction,

191
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:43,255
you'll go right past
the town square.

192
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:46,675
You might want to check out
the old Pierce house.

193
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:50,617
Aww, great Victorian thing.

194
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:53,161
Town's really proud of it.

195
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:56,085
It's right across
from the angel statue.

196
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,310
Is there really an angel?

197
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,233
Of course there's an angel.

198
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,980
Don't you know,
there are angels everywhere.

199
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,035
This one watches over that house.

200
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:21,449
It's been empty ever since Miriam
Pierce died, oh... seven years ago.

201
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:24,312
She left the whole thing
to her niece.

202
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:26,748
Never came to claim it.

203
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:31,882
Sorry... it's getting late, we gotta
get on the road. Uh, keep the change.

204
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,498
- Oh, thanks.
- Thank you. Come on kids, let's go.

205
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:38,475
And drive safely.

206
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:42,456
And don't forget to check out
the Pierce house.

207
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:47,397
Uh, excuse me.

208
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:48,721
<i>Come on.</i>

209
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:52,754
Maeve!

210
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,948
Maeve!

211
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,816
Maeve, can a guy get a
cup of coffee here?

212
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,125
All right,
you just keep your shirt on.

213
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:06,907
Rush coffee on the way.

214
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:09,906
- Unleaded? High octane?
- High octane.   - Ahh.

215
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,615
Please. Please start.

216
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,769
Where are we
gonna sleep tonight?

217
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,028
I'm not sure,
but we'll figure somethin'.

218
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:24,970
See there?
Everything's gonna be fine.

219
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,917
You just got to
get through the night

220
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,504
'cause things always look better
in the morning, right?

221
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,582
It's gonna be ok.

222
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,906
It's gonna be ok.

223
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,128
I can hardly see the road.

224
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:07,752
It's an angel, just like she said.

225
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:33,371
- What are you doing?
- I want you both to stay here,
I'll be right back.

226
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,323
Look what I found,

227
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:21,714
<i>key to our room for the night.</i>

228
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:23,353
They'll arrest us.

229
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,952
Alanna, look,

230
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:28,608
we can't afford the Inn, we're
running on fumes and it's freezing.

231
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:32,388
Nobody's gonna know,
just one night.

232
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:36,088
And things will look better
in the morning?

233
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:41,199
They just about have to, don't they?

234
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,856
When your mum and I were little,

235
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:53,194
we'd sleep like that,
like spoons.

236
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:56,917
We'd hold hands, so we
wouldn't get lost in the dark.

237
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,564
Were you scared?

238
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,788
Sometimes, yeah.

239
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:05,219
So we'd pretend that all the
bad things around us

240
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,243
were just dreams.

241
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,868
And then we'd make up stories about
what it was like in our real life.

242
00:18:13,543 --> 00:18:16,839
What kind of stories did mum make up?

243
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,498
One time your mum pretended
she was a dog catcher.

244
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,624
Who'd round up all the sad dogs
who didn't have anyone.

245
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:32,723
And she'd drive them
to this special park,

246
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:36,514
this beautiful green place,
where people would go for picnics.

247
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:40,853
She just let 'em go free,

248
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,983
so they could live happily ever after,

249
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:47,202
<i>on leftover ham sandwiches.</i>

250
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:51,308
I wish there was a park like that
for sad people.

251
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:58,641
Well, we don't need that park,
Lani.

252
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,386
We got each other...

253
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:10,307
and I'm gonna work it so we
stay together no matter what.

254
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:17,051
Goodnight.

255
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,301
They found us, they're gonna
send us back.  - Stay calm.

256
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:01,129
- No, they are.
- Stay calm, I will take care of it.

257
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:08,074
I knew it was too early. We're
so sorry to disturb you.

258
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,369
We saw the car
and the smoke from the chimney.

259
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:12,014
After all these years we just about

260
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:13,658
given up hope you'd ever come back.

261
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:15,435
It was my worrywart sister
who insisted on

262
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,150
seeing you first thing, pumpkin.

263
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,965
She thought you'd appreciate
some water and gas.

264
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:23,185
You turned on
the water and gas?

265
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:24,399
Oh, it was nothing.

266
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,933
Corinna put in our new laundry
room all by herself.

267
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,416
Me, I'm not so handy
but I do bake

268
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,449
and I brought you
some breakfast rolls

269
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:33,102
just out of the oven.

270
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:35,026
She bakes like this
all the time.

271
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:38,347
It's a wonder I'm not 300 pounds
and in a carnival side show.

272
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:41,409
They're cinnamon,
you used to love 'em.

273
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,132
<i>Well, of course I did.</i>

274
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:45,431
And just look how
you have grown.

275
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:48,285
I mean the last time we saw you
you were only six or seven,

276
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:49,994
so it's not surprising.

277
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:52,618
But pretty as a picture.

278
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:53,793
<i>Oh.</i>

279
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,565
You haven't even had time to
uncover the furniture yet.

280
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:58,069
Let us help you.

281
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:00,273
Uh, don't worry about that,
I'll do that later.

282
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:02,683
You don't even remember us,
do you?

283
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:04,748
Agatha and Corinna?

284
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:07,279
Your aunt Miriam's friends
from across the street?

285
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:09,378
Of course I do.

286
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:13,407
I used to come over
for these cinnamon rolls.

287
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,408
<i>That is so sweet of you.</i>

288
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,292
You know I would ask you to
stay for a while but actually I...

289
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:22,245
Oh, we understand
you have to get settled

290
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:25,959
and you need Gerald Foster's
say-so to get the electric on.

291
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:31,372
Aunt Miriam's attorney?

292
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:33,696
Mr. Foster. Yes.

293
00:21:34,463 --> 00:21:37,624
He's on vacation but he'll be
so excited to see you again

294
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:39,338
when he gets back.

295
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:41,591
When do you think
that might be?

296
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,002
Could be anytime
but don't you worry,

297
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,747
we won't let him surprise you
the way we did.

298
00:21:45,747 --> 00:21:47,901
Soon as we hear from him,
we'll let you know.

299
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:49,490
Please.

300
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:53,189
Of course he came to see you
when dear Miriam died, didn't he?

301
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:56,319
So he won't be at all surprised
how pretty you are now. - Hmm.

302
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,712
You know you could call Jimmy Kilgore

303
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:00,508
over at Power & Light
as soon as they open.

304
00:22:00,508 --> 00:22:02,332
Jimmy Kilgore.

305
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:04,396
I taught him third grade
and passed him.

306
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:07,538
- So he owes me big time.
- Hmm?

307
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:12,442
Now, you may think
we're losing our minds

308
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:15,103
but we can't remember your name.

309
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:17,080
We always called you pumpkin

310
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,241
but we guess you're a little
grown up for that now.

311
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,832
It's, uh, Emilie... Emilie Thompson.

312
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:26,601
Emilie.

313
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:28,470
I knew that all along.

314
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,854
Well, it's been a long time.

315
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:33,465
Welcome to Bethlehem Emilie,
and welcome back.

316
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:34,692
And when you get a breath

317
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:37,677
you come on over and we'll
catch up over my mince pie.

318
00:22:38,015 --> 00:22:39,909
I will, yes.

319
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,808
Thanks again for the rolls.

320
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,883
Oh, you're welcome dear.

321
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:52,449
- Watch the ice there Agatha.
- I'm slippin'... we're toast.

322
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:55,524
Wow.

323
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:59,130
Ok... the water's on.

324
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,864
You two can go wash up,
put everything back like it was

325
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:07,218
and we will get on the road before
someone else comes by, ok?

326
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:09,757
Come on, come on,
grab it and go.

327
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:11,350
Go, go, go.

328
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:45,270
Ok, you guys be really quiet, right?

329
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:47,494
Just look forward.

330
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,981
Good morning.

331
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,444
Hello.

332
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:01,843
Car trouble?

333
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:04,252
How's your anti-freeze?

334
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,632
Oh, I think it's more than that.

335
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:08,733
The engines been
acting up for a while.

336
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,310
Well, pop the hood,
I'll take a look.

337
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,668
No, really, I couldn't...

338
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:15,867
You don't have to ask,
all part of the job.

339
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:18,352
You know? Kittens in trees,

340
00:24:18,676 --> 00:24:21,376
flat tyres, full life.

341
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:32,610
Saw you at the diner last night,
didn't I?

342
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,030
Yes, we got into town late.

343
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:39,889
Well,

344
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,788
I think your spark plugs
are probably shot.

345
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:45,514
Spark plugs?
You think that might be it?

346
00:24:45,814 --> 00:24:49,144
Well, uh, with an engine this, um, old,

347
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:52,779
I don't know, it could be bad points,
the timing might be off,

348
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:55,394
you might have oil
in your combustion chamber.

349
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:58,904
You know, why don't we just get Mitch
over at the garage to take a look at it.

350
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:02,743
You weren't leaving town were you?

351
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:05,809
No, uh, we were just going
to the market because

352
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,643
there's nothing in the house, so...
- Oh...

353
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:13,092
I'd be more than glad
to give you a lift.

354
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,650
- I'm Nathan.
- Nathan.

355
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,094
Nathan Blair. I'm sort of the long arm
of the law here in Bethlehem.

356
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,728
- Emilie...
- Thompson, right?

357
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:25,226
- Oh, your neighbours, the two sisters.
- Yes.

358
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:28,190
They called me, explained
the whole thing to me.

359
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,255
They're sort of our local
information superhighway.

360
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:33,776
But they didn't get to meet the kids.

361
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:36,608
Yeah. Those are my kids.

362
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:39,460
Yeah. No, I didn't think they
came with the car.

363
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,445
Tell you what, why don't you
gather the kids together

364
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:48,000
and I'll call Mitch and he'll
be over here by noon.

365
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:49,844
Great.

366
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:52,568
Thank you Officer.

367
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,521
This is really, really important, ok?

368
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:05,937
We need to think of this as a game
until I can get the car fixed.

369
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:07,708
What kind of game?

370
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,969
Um, a game of pretend.

371
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:12,468
I want you to pretend
that I'm your mum.

372
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:15,119
<i>Ok, so you call me mum and</i>

373
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:17,925
<i>if anybody asks you anything
you just say, uh,</i>

374
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:20,893
your mum doesn't let you
talk to strangers. Ok?

375
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:25,021
Now look, I know it's really bad
but I'm asking you to fib,

376
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:27,658
but I don't think we have
a choice right now.

377
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:30,139
It's ok, everybody lies.

378
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:32,430
<i>No, everybody doesn't lie</i>

379
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,492
and as soon as we get through this
we won't either, ok?

380
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,888
What do you say?

381
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,028
<i>Can we play this game
and play it really, really well?</i>

382
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:45,252
Yeah?

383
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:56,269
<i>Your kids are about the
quietest kids I've ever met.</i>

384
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:58,904
Mum says we can't talk to strangers.

385
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,711
I say you got a very smart mum.

386
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:05,995
You'll find this town's a little more
trusting than most.  - Yes.

387
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:08,434
Where are y'all from anyway?

388
00:27:08,434 --> 00:27:11,197
- We're from Providence.
- With the Georgia plate?

389
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:14,108
Well, I used to live in Atlanta,

390
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:17,965
I'm moving back and forth,
it's complicated.

391
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:21,578
Hey. JT, what you got there?

392
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:23,401
<i>You a baseball fan?</i>

393
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,633
JT Snow?

394
00:27:28,757 --> 00:27:30,657
<i>A great infielder.</i>

395
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,913
Came out of the Yankees... '92.

396
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:36,537
Is that where you got your nickname?

397
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,905
It's his real name.
His dad gave it to him.

398
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:43,376
Ha ha, your husband's
a big fan then, huh?

399
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,879
Hmm. Did anyone ever tell you,
you ask a lot of questions?

400
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,627
Occupational hazard... sorry.

401
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:52,251
Hmph. That's ok.

402
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,643
So where does grocery shopping fall
into that job description of yours?

403
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,898
Below car-repair, below pet rescue?

404
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:04,232
Alright, you think I'm kidding.
But uh,

405
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:06,377
this place has been
a nice change for me

406
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:08,084
- back home I was...
- You're not from here?

407
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:10,365
No. Born in Illinois.

408
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:13,588
High school, college, eight years
on the force in Chicago but

409
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:15,292
seven years too many.

410
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,762
When this job opened up,
I ran for it.

411
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,697
Can we get a cake, Emilie?

412
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:23,621
I'm sorry.

413
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:29,628
Well, um, mum doesn't like it
when I call her that but...

414
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:33,009
I do because it makes me
feel older...

415
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,708
but...

416
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:37,687
she thinks it makes me sound fresh.

417
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:38,786
<i>Oh.</i>

418
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:42,505
You know what? I tried it
with my dad once and...

419
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,009
he didn't like it any more than
your mum does.

420
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,880
No.

421
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:50,244
- It's ok, Lani.
- Hey, cheer up...

422
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,509
your eyes are too pretty
to look sad.

423
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,750
What do you say we get that cake?
My treat.

424
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,494
Absolutely not, uh, you've
done enough for us already.

425
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:02,990
<i>Come on, next up.</i>

426
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,114
You play baseball by yourself, JT?

427
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,338
He only talks to me.

428
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:16,462
Yeah? I can see that. Heh.

429
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:18,286
He's just shy. Hehe.

430
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,110
Hey, there's a great middle way here.
They've got a really nice field.

431
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,546
When your husband comes into town
I could show him...

432
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,570
He isn't, uh, I mean the kids' father
he isn't going to be coming.

433
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:30,294
- You raise them yourself?
- Yeah.

434
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:34,118
Inside you two.

435
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,242
Look, I know you don't me

436
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:44,066
and I don't know much about kids but
if there's anything I can do to help...

437
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,790
I'll let you know.

438
00:29:46,814 --> 00:29:49,614
Thank you... again.

439
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:53,138
Feel like I'm wearing out
those two words.

440
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:55,962
Happy to help.

441
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:57,786
So long.

442
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:22,178
Hey...

443
00:30:24,202 --> 00:30:26,502
It's the cake you wanted.

444
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,446
I didn't buy it.

445
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,470
It was probably him.

446
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:39,046
Do you want to tell me
what's bothering you?

447
00:30:40,846 --> 00:30:44,130
Do you... do you not like
Officer Blair, or...?

448
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:49,329
Is that true about JT's father?

449
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,365
Did he really name him?

450
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:55,086
Well, your mum did...

451
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,385
but apparently it was his idea.

452
00:30:57,386 --> 00:31:00,176
She thought it would
keep him around...

453
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:03,046
so, that's what she called him.

454
00:31:05,912 --> 00:31:08,395
What about my father?

455
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:10,661
Did he name me?

456
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:14,085
Let's not get into this right now.

457
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,519
No, I want to know.

458
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,118
Well, I don't know, Lani.

459
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,734
I don't think even, uh...

460
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:26,222
I don't think he even met you.

461
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:38,530
But you got your eyes from him.

462
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,780
And they're really pretty.

463
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,419
Just like Officer Blair said.

464
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,971
You can't believe anything
the policeman says anyway.

465
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:02,794
So how long do you think
it'll take to fix this?

466
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,722
It depends on what I find.

467
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,965
I oughta know something
by this evening.

468
00:32:06,965 --> 00:32:09,577
Well, it doesn't have to be perfect,
it just has to start and go.

469
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:12,519
There's a lot that goes into
that start and go business.

470
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,572
Yeah.

471
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:15,996
Don't worry, if it's
gonna take a while,

472
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:18,258
I got a loaner
I can let you have.

473
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:20,748
Not too stylish
but it gets around.

474
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:33,198
I'm only asking you for
the good of the children.

475
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:35,542
But you don't know
what's good for my kids.

476
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:37,717
Nobody around here knows
what's good for us.

477
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:40,023
Oh, they know what
they're doing around here.

478
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:42,608
Oh really, well I wish
I had your faith.

479
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:46,535
And I wish that you would tell me
what your sister did with Alanna and JT.

480
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:49,120
If I knew, which I don't,
I wouldn't tell you.

481
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,757
'Cause they're better off with her
than anything you people have to offer.

482
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:54,902
Berry,
what about relatives?

483
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:57,216
We don't have any,
we told you.

484
00:32:57,316 --> 00:33:00,819
Ok, we're alone, it's me and my sister,
check your records.

485
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,252
You don't get it.

486
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,576
They're already with the
best person for 'em.

487
00:33:13,352 --> 00:33:16,787
I guess we'll have to alert the police,
have them start a search,

488
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,768
enough to pull a photo
from the Atlanta DMV.

489
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:23,054
Thompson. T.H.O.M.<i>P</i>.S.O.N, Emilie.

490
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:34,178
Can't imagine a niece of Miriam
Pierce driving a junk heap like this.

491
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:37,402
Held together with spit
and chewing gum.

492
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:40,126
Yeah, she sure is anxious
to get it running real soon.

493
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,950
Well, it won't be tonight.

494
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:44,025
I can tell you that much.

495
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:46,049
Oil, sticky, tar.

496
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:48,272
Battery's a door stop.

497
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:50,525
Filter's stopped filterin'.

498
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:53,025
And that is just the start of it.

499
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:56,149
No, she's not goin'
anywhere tonight.

500
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,171
I hate to bother you again

501
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:06,957
but since you don't have
a phone as yet,

502
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,259
Mitch at the garage
called our house.

503
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:12,663
Yes, yes, please come in out of
the cold. Power still isn't on but...

504
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:15,376
Jimmy hasn't turned that on yet?

505
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:17,450
I should have flunked him
when I had the chance.

506
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,822
Well, hello...

507
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:21,219
- <i>Guess you haven't met...</i>
- ...your children.

508
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,209
- Elana and JT.
- Hello.

509
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,513
You've been talking
to Officer Blair.

510
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:30,711
And he was right about them,
they're adorable and so handsome.

511
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,807
So, you said Mitch called.

512
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,483
He said you have a crack in
something called an engine block.

513
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:40,886
Is that bad?

514
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:43,568
I don't know exactly
but it's not good.

515
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,989
He said probably easier
to buy a new car.

516
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,373
A new car?

517
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,005
Now that's not so bad.
A car loan'd be a snap.

518
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:54,458
You've got this house for collateral.

519
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:57,030
Yeah... I wish it were that simple.

520
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,423
Well, if you're really attached to it,
Mitch'll fix it.

521
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:03,502
He said it would cost about $800.

522
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,481
- Hmph.
- Is that a problem?

523
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:10,373
Right now, it...
might as well be $8,000.

524
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,499
Good afternoon. It is
as cold as can be.

525
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,103
Yeah, weather must have
affected our fax machine.

526
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:26,157
We haven't got a fax in two days
and that can't be right.

527
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:29,153
- Anybody seen the instruction book?
- Not me.

528
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:33,076
Oh, Sadie? Is there any coffee?

529
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:35,555
<i>We've had this little talk.</i>

530
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:37,495
I don't do coffee.

531
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:39,394
I'm liberated.

532
00:35:39,395 --> 00:35:42,236
I know, I know, and I wasn't
asking you to <i>make</i> it.

533
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:45,620
I just wanted to know if
there was any <i>already</i> made.

534
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,836
Oh.

535
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,960
No.

536
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:51,317
Oh, here's the problem...

537
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:54,690
there's no paper in the fax Sadie,
we're out of paper.

538
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,910
I'll need a requisition form for that.

539
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:00,609
What's this?

540
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,095
License and registration
information you asked for.

541
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:04,722
Emilie Thompson,

542
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,946
Atlanta, Georgia.

543
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:10,893
Not so much as a parking ticket.
That's good.

544
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,302
Is that Miriam's niece?

545
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:16,727
What? That wasn't a good
enough reference for you?

546
00:36:16,827 --> 00:36:19,360
Well, you can take a cop
out of Chicago...

547
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,677
- It's just a feeling.
- Right.

548
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:24,177
Jeanne over at the market
said she saw that

549
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:26,401
'feeling' firsthand.

550
00:36:26,877 --> 00:36:29,200
The woman is new in town,

551
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,949
- I'm... I'm just helping out.
- Mmm-hmm.

552
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:35,631
When you're ready to talk,
you know where to find me.

553
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:46,121
Couldn't we just take the loaner car,
he could keep ours.

554
00:36:46,423 --> 00:36:49,196
As long as the attorney
isn't in town our secret is safe.

555
00:36:49,196 --> 00:36:53,522
and we're not hurting anyone by staying
here but taking someone else's car...

556
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:56,433
No, we can't do that to someone.

557
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:59,194
So what are we gonna do?

558
00:36:59,194 --> 00:37:01,614
Well, I'm gonna get a job,

559
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:03,998
earn the money and
pay for the repairs.

560
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:06,103
That could take forever. You
know we're gonna get caught.

561
00:37:06,103 --> 00:37:08,200
The police are probably
already looking for us.

562
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,544
Which is why I think it's better
that we stay here

563
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:12,229
rather than out on the road.

564
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:16,264
I mean no one knows we're here,
we'll be really careful, ok?

565
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:19,988
Let me get your plates.

566
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:22,512
Aunt Emilie?

567
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:24,633
Lights!

568
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,009
There's heat!

569
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,433
What happened?

570
00:37:52,457 --> 00:37:54,657
I think Agatha and Corinna happened.

571
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:57,581
- And you know what this means?
- What?

572
00:37:57,605 --> 00:38:00,705
We don't need a fire, it'll be warm
enough to sleep in a bedroom tonight.

573
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:02,733
Our own bedroom?

574
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:05,057
Why not? We've got
seven to choose from.

575
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:07,081
- Whoo-hoo.
- Wait for me!

576
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:10,105
Oh, phfft...

577
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:12,929
Please let this last.

578
00:38:41,643 --> 00:38:43,134
Hello?

579
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:48,450
Hello?

580
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,236
Can I help you?

581
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:02,679
Oh, I'm...
I'm looking for Officer Blair.

582
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,727
Oh, he doesn't come into
work till noon today.

583
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:09,495
- <i>Um...</i>
- You must be <i>Emilie</i>.

584
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:12,713
I know everyone else in town.

585
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:15,137
- Sadie Miller.
- Hi.

586
00:39:15,713 --> 00:39:19,067
Fresh coffee in about five minutes,
if you'd like a cup.

587
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,841
I only fix it when the boys
aren't here.

588
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:25,781
So now's your chance.
I don't know what they do to it.

589
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:28,483
Thanks, but uh, I just came by

590
00:39:28,483 --> 00:39:30,528
to see if he might know
of a job opening

591
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:33,623
for a woman who needs
to make $800 in a hurry.

592
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,333
Oh, the car.

593
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:36,908
Oh, I heard.

594
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,664
You know, if it's a job you want...

595
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:43,275
two of Holly McBride's...

596
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,808
best people ran off to elope

597
00:39:45,832 --> 00:39:48,407
and this is the ends
busiest season till spring.

598
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:50,243
That's where I'd start.

599
00:39:50,243 --> 00:39:51,714
<i>I'll check it out.</i>

600
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:53,454
The end of the street

601
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:55,153
and you take a left

602
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:57,829
and you tell Holly

603
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,042
that I sent you.

604
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,866
Thank you so much. Oh.

605
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,941
Your little girl would
like that, I bet.

606
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:12,565
- Alanna, isn't it?
- Yes, she would.

607
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:17,808
You know...

608
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:21,250
we're having an open house
here at the station...

609
00:40:21,674 --> 00:40:23,249
Christmas Eve.

610
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,568
Everybody just kind of drops by.

611
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:30,508
Nathan's playing Santa this year.

612
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:33,190
Oh, I bet he'd love that.

613
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,828
I hope so...
he doesn't know yet.

614
00:40:37,628 --> 00:40:40,526
Can I tell him you 'stopped' by?

615
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,525
Yeah, sure.

616
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,475
Great.

617
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,899
This thing is gonna be the death of me.

618
00:40:58,975 --> 00:41:01,309
I don't know how Santa does it,
year after year.

619
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:05,011
I was saying, you're some kind of
lucky charm walking in here today.

620
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:06,571
Oh, that's a first.

621
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:09,095
I don't think anyone's ever
thought me as lucky before.

622
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,692
- When can you start?
- Start?

623
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:15,052
Uh, don't you need references
or an application or something?

624
00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:17,991
You're a friend of Nathan's
and I'm a desperate woman.

625
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,322
Who elopes these days?

626
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:22,021
People in love, I guess.

627
00:41:22,222 --> 00:41:25,472
Wonderful for them
but I've got a business to run.

628
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:27,671
So, if you don't mind
making beds and

629
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:29,895
wrestling with that flue
from time to time.

630
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:33,042
No, no, don't mind at all...
anything.

631
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:39,591
<i>So, I start first thing
tomorrow morning.</i>

632
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,865
- Sure didn't waste any time.
- And why would she?

633
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:44,077
She comes from hard-working
Yankee stock,

634
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:45,763
just like her aunt Miriam.

635
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,517
Miriam never worked
a day in her life,

636
00:41:47,517 --> 00:41:49,874
wouldn't know a lug wrench from a
crescent if her life depended on it.

637
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:53,118
You will let us watch the children
while you work, won't you?

638
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:55,366
They're upstairs now,
colouring away

639
00:41:55,366 --> 00:41:57,788
- and they're such a joy.
- Ohh...

640
00:41:57,988 --> 00:41:59,574
I really appreciate that actually.

641
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:00,938
They're such good company

642
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:03,302
and they can come here
every day after school.

643
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:06,156
Have you talked to principal
Blevins at the elementary yet?

644
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,923
That's my old school.

645
00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:12,461
Oh, no, I... actually,
I haven't thought about it.

646
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:14,303
Well, come right on in dear,

647
00:42:14,403 --> 00:42:16,339
we were just congratulating
the newest member

648
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:17,723
of Bethlehem's workforce.

649
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:20,334
Hey, hey, you got a job
at Holly's, that's great.

650
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,468
Sadie said you
wanted to see me.

651
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:25,002
- We did?
- Yeah.

652
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,701
- <i>Oh, right we did.</i>
- She said it was urgent.

653
00:42:26,702 --> 00:42:29,183
Yes, yes, we needed
to see you because, um...

654
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:31,947
well, I guess my mind's
gone south for the winter.

655
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:33,482
Agatha?

656
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:35,406
Uh, because...

657
00:42:35,482 --> 00:42:38,209
I made extra jars of that
vegetable soup you like so much.

658
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:41,480
- Agatha's soup.
- The soup was urgent?

659
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,699
It was hot at the time.

660
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,923
I'll get it.

661
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:51,773
It'll make a fine dinner.

662
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:54,947
Of course there's quite a lot
of it, enough for two, at least.

663
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,468
<i>Uh, Corinna dear,</i>

664
00:42:56,468 --> 00:42:59,129
I'm not sure I can do this by myself.

665
00:42:59,229 --> 00:43:02,916
Oh, well, perhaps you could
show Emilie where the school... is.

666
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:06,494
Oh, you're getting
the kids set up at school.

667
00:43:06,594 --> 00:43:09,408
You're putting down roots.
I like the sound of that.

668
00:43:09,452 --> 00:43:11,589
Yeah, I don't know, there's a lot
to do before I can...

669
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,586
No, what you need is their birth
certificates and school records.

670
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:16,360
Yeah, if I can find them.
This move has been really confusing...

671
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:18,361
Just have their old school
send them here and then...

672
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:19,688
was that Providence or Atlanta?

673
00:43:19,688 --> 00:43:21,252
You know what,
with the car and the job

674
00:43:21,252 --> 00:43:22,829
and I-I just don't think
I can really...

675
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:25,493
I got it, I'll come by, I'll pick up
you and the kids in the morning

676
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:28,150
- and we'll get the whole thing done by...
- No!

677
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,389
Thank you. Thank you.

678
00:43:56,555 --> 00:43:57,851
Hello?

679
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:01,675
Hank.

680
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:04,085
Hello Hank, it's Nathan.

681
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,209
Is there anybody here?

682
00:44:07,776 --> 00:44:09,574
Can I help you?

683
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:12,098
Didn't mean to startle you.

684
00:44:12,104 --> 00:44:14,335
I was in the powder room.

685
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:17,346
No, I just um, I saw the light and

686
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:20,220
Hank's usually got everything
locked up tight by now.

687
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,373
Yes, well, Mr. Harrison
doesn't have my workload.

688
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,107
No.

689
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,131
You're new here?

690
00:44:28,155 --> 00:44:29,355
Yes.

691
00:44:30,107 --> 00:44:32,300
Hey, um, where is Hank,
uh, Mr. Harrison?

692
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,441
At home I suppose,

693
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,652
while I'm here tidying up.

694
00:44:36,952 --> 00:44:39,425
Trying to get things <i>organised</i>,

695
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:41,424
everything in its place.

696
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:44,023
Can I get you something?

697
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:45,947
Oh, no, no, thanks.

698
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,609
Yes.

699
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:56,533
Could you look up an old deed
for me? The Pierce house.

700
00:44:56,557 --> 00:44:58,757
Miriam's place.

701
00:44:59,187 --> 00:45:01,189
That's an easy one.

702
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:05,511
In fact I was just about to put
that book in a file...

703
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:09,251
there it is. M through T.

704
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,875
I hear her... niece

705
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:15,999
finally came back.

706
00:45:17,336 --> 00:45:20,392
There you go, Miriam Pierce.

707
00:45:21,992 --> 00:45:25,444
It's not good for a house like that
to be empty.

708
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:28,061
It should be filled with life...

709
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:29,785
family.

710
00:45:32,055 --> 00:45:35,726
Doesn't mention anything about a niece.

711
00:45:36,326 --> 00:45:39,108
Oh, that would be in
the probate amendment,

712
00:45:39,108 --> 00:45:41,817
at Gerald Foster's law office.

713
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:45,138
- He's still on vacation, you know.
- Right.

714
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:47,176
Well, I'll drop by his office
in the morning,

715
00:45:47,176 --> 00:45:49,110
maybe they can look it up for me.

716
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,792
Now, we might get lucky...

717
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:55,303
and there might just be

718
00:45:55,427 --> 00:45:57,527
a copy of it...

719
00:45:58,027 --> 00:45:59,527
right here.

720
00:46:05,301 --> 00:46:07,161
Emilie Thompson.

721
00:46:07,785 --> 00:46:09,785
I love that.

722
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:14,476
Says Emilie Thompson.
I love that it says that.

723
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:19,735
Oh, it doesn't take much
to make you happy, does it?

724
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,677
Just a little ink on a page.

725
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:23,766
Don't work too late tonight.

726
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:27,072
In fact, I think you should
go home and enjoy yourself.

727
00:46:27,472 --> 00:46:29,300
I just might do that.

728
00:46:29,924 --> 00:46:31,424
Hah, hah, hah.

729
00:46:34,022 --> 00:46:35,198
Oh.

730
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:37,622
Hey, I just wanted to say, um,

731
00:46:37,698 --> 00:46:39,709
welcome to...

732
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:42,933
Bethlehem.

733
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:47,403
Hello?

734
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,860
Hi.

735
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:18,159
Hah, hah, hah.

736
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,224
Hah, did you win the lottery
or something?

737
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:23,215
Better, um...

738
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:26,238
Here.

739
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:28,639
- For us?
- Yeah.

740
00:47:28,703 --> 00:47:31,172
I'm feeling Christmasy
all of a sudden.

741
00:47:32,272 --> 00:47:34,405
- Come in.
- Thanks.

742
00:47:35,205 --> 00:47:37,667
Uh, is it something in the
water here?

743
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,881
I mean, doesn't anyone
get a little cranky?

744
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:42,555
Nuh. Cranky's illegal
here in Bethlehem.

745
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:44,978
It's right up there
with jaywalking and

746
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:46,532
cheating at Scrabble.

747
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:49,588
I-I think, in fact, we have the
toughest scrabble laws in the country.

748
00:47:50,574 --> 00:47:53,075
Alanna, JT, come look.

749
00:47:56,828 --> 00:47:58,328
What's that?

750
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:00,569
It's a wreath.

751
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:02,068
You put it on the door.

752
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:04,788
Didn't you ever see a
Christmas wreath before?

753
00:48:05,788 --> 00:48:07,534
I've seen 'em,

754
00:48:08,158 --> 00:48:10,458
I just never had one before.

755
00:48:11,334 --> 00:48:13,486
Well, you know what?

756
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:16,324
I have got something else
for both of you.

757
00:48:16,948 --> 00:48:18,348
Come here.

758
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,903
JT?

759
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:25,627
Why don't you open this one?

760
00:48:29,527 --> 00:48:31,992
He wants you to open it.

761
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:33,491
Okay.

762
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:36,444
I... I guess I can do that.

763
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,310
It's an angel.

764
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:54,309
If you tell her your wishes

765
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,860
she can help make them come true.

766
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,316
You, uh, put her on your tree.

767
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:04,774
<i>Oh, well...</i>

768
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:07,498
we never had a tree either.

769
00:49:10,098 --> 00:49:11,498
Never?

770
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:16,506
We, uh, moved around a lot so,
you know... trees, yeah.

771
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,430
Yeah.

772
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:23,208
Come on JT.

773
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,600
Well, maybe that could be
your first wish...

774
00:49:27,824 --> 00:49:29,424
a tree.

775
00:49:33,874 --> 00:49:35,594
Come here, JT.

776
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,503
It's a angel, Lani.

777
00:50:16,756 --> 00:50:18,847
That was, uh...

778
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:22,071
almost impossibly kind.

779
00:50:23,047 --> 00:50:25,908
I wish there was something
I could, uh...

780
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,722
some way to...

781
00:50:27,746 --> 00:50:29,146
No, I, uh...

782
00:50:31,122 --> 00:50:34,185
Yeah, I've... I've got a couple more
deliveries tonight before, um,

783
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:37,601
before it gets too late.

784
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:48,876
- Goodnight.
- Yes, thank you.

785
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,400
But what if they ask for
our birth certificates?

786
00:50:53,424 --> 00:50:55,424
No one's gonna ask
on your first day.

787
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:57,848
Besides, they're gonna
ask me, not you.

788
00:50:58,072 --> 00:51:00,672
I thought we weren't
gonna be here long.

789
00:51:00,696 --> 00:51:02,934
No one knows that yet.

790
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,558
It's not gonna hurt you to
learn somethin' for a few days.

791
00:51:05,582 --> 00:51:07,782
- I know a lot.
- <i>Too much.</i>

792
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,530
Not the kind of things you should.

793
00:51:11,254 --> 00:51:12,854
It's different here.

794
00:51:12,878 --> 00:51:14,534
Do you like it?

795
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:17,458
It's ok.

796
00:51:17,582 --> 00:51:19,382
It's not like Providence.

797
00:51:21,406 --> 00:51:23,406
It's not real anyway.

798
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,630
We don't...

799
00:51:26,154 --> 00:51:28,054
really belong here.

800
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,810
<i>Mmmm. Ohh. Whoa.</i>

801
00:51:51,435 --> 00:51:53,619
One bought box... supplies.

802
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,944
Pens, pencils,

803
00:51:56,344 --> 00:51:58,511
notepads, paper clips...

804
00:51:59,635 --> 00:52:01,935
paper for the fax.

805
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,424
Now, we'll see what
we've been missing.

806
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:08,276
Probably the usual notices:
garage sales, apartments for rent.

807
00:52:09,014 --> 00:52:11,527
So, what's the latest
on you and the niece?

808
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:13,772
No latest, we're just friends.

809
00:52:13,972 --> 00:52:16,116
Mm, you forget who you're talking to.

810
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:17,788
You can fool Howie

811
00:52:17,788 --> 00:52:20,798
and you maybe can
even fool yourself but

812
00:52:20,898 --> 00:52:22,941
I know what's going on.

813
00:52:23,029 --> 00:52:26,878
- Care to tell me what that might be?
- Ooh... I think you know.

814
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:31,215
Sadie, I'm not gonna play,
I've got work.

815
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:34,376
And we've got faxes
coming through.

816
00:52:34,476 --> 00:52:36,950
We gots us two dozen of them.

817
00:52:37,174 --> 00:52:39,974
- Garage sale?
- No... lost dog.

818
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,903
Hey, I know this pooch.

819
00:52:42,903 --> 00:52:45,475
<i>Oh Howie,
you just know everyone.</i>

820
00:52:45,475 --> 00:52:47,954
I got a fire hydrant
in front of my house.

821
00:52:47,978 --> 00:52:49,778
<i>Oh, that explains it.</i>

822
00:52:58,602 --> 00:53:01,174
<i>Bethlehem Police Department,
can I help you?</i>

823
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:04,515
<i>Yeah, that'll be here.</i>

824
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:06,439
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

825
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,354
Called the principal and told him
your records were being sent.

826
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:16,973
He won't ask again
till we've left,

827
00:53:16,997 --> 00:53:19,633
so you don't have anything
to worry about, ok?

828
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:22,251
Now, I'm not gonna be able to pick
you guys up from school today

829
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:24,245
so if you go to the sisters
straight away

830
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:26,361
and I'll come get you
after I'm done with work.

831
00:53:26,361 --> 00:53:28,530
- You got that?
- Mm-hm.

832
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,427
Now, if anybody asks you
any questions...

833
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:35,578
Eat up, I'll be right back.

834
00:53:38,402 --> 00:53:39,802
Come on.

835
00:53:45,951 --> 00:53:47,146
Yes?

836
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,845
I think you've been
expecting me. Uh,

837
00:53:49,846 --> 00:53:52,513
Mr. Foster, attorney at law.

838
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,040
- Ah.
- Did I call at a bad time?

839
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,061
No, no, no, Mr. Foster,
I-I-I have been expecting you.

840
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,456
Actually, you look a lot
younger than I'd imagined.

841
00:54:01,556 --> 00:54:02,926
<i>Imagined?</i>

842
00:54:02,926 --> 00:54:07,235
Well, we did meet once
as children, I think, but...

843
00:54:07,735 --> 00:54:10,367
my uncle, Gerald Foster, he, uh,

844
00:54:10,367 --> 00:54:13,047
he took care of all the
paperwork and all, so...

845
00:54:13,071 --> 00:54:14,546
And you're...?

846
00:54:14,547 --> 00:54:16,658
Sorry... Alexander.

847
00:54:16,782 --> 00:54:18,782
Alexander Foster.

848
00:54:19,251 --> 00:54:20,672
Alexander...

849
00:54:21,196 --> 00:54:22,895
not Gerald.

850
00:54:22,996 --> 00:54:25,796
Of course, please, come in.

851
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:33,516
Oh... and children.

852
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:36,563
You've got all sorts of surprises
for us, don't you?

853
00:54:37,063 --> 00:54:38,737
Alanna, JT,

854
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:40,336
this is Mr. Foster,

855
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,836
<i>say hello.</i>

856
00:54:41,837 --> 00:54:43,091
Hello.

857
00:54:43,115 --> 00:54:44,415
Hi.

858
00:54:46,005 --> 00:54:49,812
Oh, what...
that's a beautiful tree.

859
00:54:50,012 --> 00:54:53,431
<i>And this house,
it's been empty for so long,</i>

860
00:54:53,531 --> 00:54:56,256
<i>I'd forgotten what life
was like inside it...</i>

861
00:54:56,356 --> 00:54:59,317
Oh, I dropped by to tell you that

862
00:54:59,317 --> 00:55:02,217
uncle Gerald is anxious to see you again

863
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:04,613
but I'm afraid it'll be
another two weeks.

864
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:07,726
You see, he's found himself
on a warm beach somewhere

865
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:09,282
and can't pry himself away

866
00:55:09,282 --> 00:55:11,362
but he will be back... ah,

867
00:55:11,386 --> 00:55:14,361
Christmas Eve. Just in time
for the town's open house.

868
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,251
See, heh, uncle Gerald,

869
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:18,556
he thinks they can't
do it without him.

870
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:20,447
You know uncle Gerald?

871
00:55:20,447 --> 00:55:22,934
Oh yes, I know uncle Gerald.

872
00:55:23,434 --> 00:55:25,971
So, we have two whole weeks,

873
00:55:26,871 --> 00:55:30,190
That's just wonderful, so wonderful,

874
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,698
knowing he'll be back so soon,
two weeks.

875
00:55:34,222 --> 00:55:35,497
Thank you.

876
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,642
Oh, well, you are eager
to see him again, aren't you?

877
00:55:38,852 --> 00:55:40,382
Ohh...

878
00:55:40,406 --> 00:55:41,706
Hmph.

879
00:55:46,906 --> 00:55:48,906
Don't you ever take a break?

880
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,030
Hey.

881
00:55:50,254 --> 00:55:51,399
Ah.

882
00:55:51,699 --> 00:55:55,254
No, the uh, sisters wanted the place
looking especially festive this year

883
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:58,258
to keep up with the Addison's
down the street.

884
00:55:58,282 --> 00:55:59,382
Oh.

885
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:03,053
This whole neighbourhood
decorating competition's

886
00:56:03,053 --> 00:56:04,548
gotten completely out of hand.

887
00:56:04,548 --> 00:56:07,608
Ah, he asked me...
would you hold this?

888
00:56:07,608 --> 00:56:09,888
- Oh, sure.
- Look, nobody does.

889
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:11,687
Does Miriam do the lights?

890
00:56:11,688 --> 00:56:14,112
I mean, did she used to decorate
the house?    - Huh.

891
00:56:14,112 --> 00:56:16,286
What I've heard she must have had

892
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:18,802
a couple of miles of lights
hidden up there somewhere.

893
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:20,126
Really?

894
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,451
Hey, before I pick up the kids

895
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:27,054
would you mind helping me
look for 'em? I, uh...

896
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:29,530
you know I just don't
want to disappoint them.

897
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,603
Yeah, sure.

898
00:56:31,927 --> 00:56:33,327
Thank you.

899
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:44,040
<i>That's a lot of lights.</i>

900
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,781
About enough to...
cause a statewide blackout.

901
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:51,908
You know, I think there are more lights
in those boxes. Could you check those?

902
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:54,314
I'm gonna transport
some of these here.

903
00:57:03,564 --> 00:57:05,564
- What's wrong? Something Wrong?
- Ohh...

904
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,394
this doesn't feel right
snooping through all this stuff.

905
00:57:08,694 --> 00:57:11,146
You act like it isn't yours.

906
00:57:11,146 --> 00:57:14,988
Well, you know it isn't,
it was Miriam's, I just...

907
00:57:15,488 --> 00:57:17,146
inherited it.

908
00:57:17,746 --> 00:57:20,432
It's like the woman never
threw anything away.

909
00:57:20,832 --> 00:57:23,889
Oh, oh, I think some of these
were yours.

910
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:27,041
Want to dig through 'em,
relive some memories?   - <i>No...</i>

911
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:30,393
my past isn't something
I'm particularly proud of.

912
00:57:30,393 --> 00:57:32,856
I don't really want to
go digging right now.

913
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,755
Ok.

914
00:57:33,756 --> 00:57:36,507
Sorry, I didn't mean to,
you know....

915
00:57:36,531 --> 00:57:38,331
I know...

916
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:39,855
it's ok.

917
00:57:42,347 --> 00:57:43,747
Oh...

918
00:57:45,572 --> 00:57:47,272
look at that.

919
00:57:48,621 --> 00:57:50,510
She's a beauty.

920
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,723
I wanted to be a ballerina
when I was a kid.

921
00:57:56,433 --> 00:58:00,186
You know, I think that's the first
truly personal thing you said to me.

922
00:58:01,786 --> 00:58:03,344
Well, uh...

923
00:58:03,544 --> 00:58:07,240
took three lessons and
then we moved

924
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:09,464
and it didn't happen.

925
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,143
Nothin' else to tell.

926
00:58:11,143 --> 00:58:14,685
You know, I don't believe it.
I think there is more to tell.

927
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:17,133
I think there's a lot to tell.

928
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:19,388
and I know for sure there's a
lot I'd like to hear about you.

929
00:58:19,388 --> 00:58:22,335
Kids are probably wondering
what happened to me.

930
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:29,582
It's just... you're doing it again.

931
00:58:29,582 --> 00:58:32,263
No, you're pulling away and I-I...

932
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:33,988
I just don't think you want to.

933
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:37,595
I think you want to be close.
It's like you're afraid.

934
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:40,169
It's nothing...

935
00:58:40,169 --> 00:58:42,914
Don't say it's nothing,
say it's none of my business.

936
00:58:43,814 --> 00:58:46,891
But don't say it's nothing,
'cause I know better.

937
00:59:01,268 --> 00:59:03,736
You know, you are on my mind...

938
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,435
all the time.

939
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:08,190
I find myself smiling
just thinking about you

940
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,445
and you are so beautiful and...

941
00:59:12,645 --> 00:59:14,712
you're so real, and you're
so good with your kids...

942
00:59:14,712 --> 00:59:17,388
- Nathan, please...
- It's true, really.

943
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,514
I've waited my whole life to
feel this way about somebody.

944
00:59:22,314 --> 00:59:23,692
Yeah.

945
00:59:23,716 --> 00:59:25,516
But you don't know...

946
00:59:25,592 --> 00:59:27,893
No, I do know,
I know how I feel.

947
00:59:27,893 --> 00:59:29,648
And I know that I trust you.

948
00:59:29,648 --> 00:59:32,126
- Do you know that I'm leaving?
- What?

949
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,750
In two weeks.

950
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,006
Why?

951
00:59:37,797 --> 00:59:39,203
Because...

952
00:59:39,427 --> 00:59:42,602
JT, he needs to go
to a special school and

953
00:59:42,603 --> 00:59:45,388
I mean they both do. You know,
Alanna has reading problems and...

954
00:59:45,388 --> 00:59:48,411
Wait, when, when did you
decide to do this?

955
00:59:53,911 --> 00:59:55,351
I...

956
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:58,075
know exactly how you feel,

957
00:59:58,235 --> 01:00:00,845
because I feel the same way.

958
01:00:03,736 --> 01:00:05,541
But it's not possible.

959
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,769
No please, please don't make it
more difficult than it already is.

960
01:00:10,393 --> 01:00:11,393
Ok.

961
01:00:14,017 --> 01:00:15,109
Ok.

962
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,736
Ok, you're determined to leave,
I hear you...

963
01:00:20,336 --> 01:00:22,446
but give me the two weeks.

964
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:26,866
That's crazy.

965
01:00:26,866 --> 01:00:28,525
Probably but...

966
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:31,449
I want you to give us a chance.

967
01:00:31,525 --> 01:00:32,993
Maybe...

968
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:35,217
I don't know, maybe you'll
change your mind...

969
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:38,877
maybe I'll change it for you.
I don't know, anything...

970
01:00:39,877 --> 01:00:41,944
anything can happen.

971
01:00:41,944 --> 01:00:43,617
Just one...

972
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,741
two weeks with you.

973
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:52,822
And if that's all it is,
at least we had that.

974
01:00:53,222 --> 01:00:55,089
What do you say?

975
01:01:13,661 --> 01:01:15,261
Oh, really?

976
01:01:27,386 --> 01:01:29,096
Thank you.

977
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,599
- It's gorgeous.
- Hahaha

978
01:01:42,023 --> 01:01:44,023
Oh, wow!

979
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:45,598
Just gorgeous!

980
01:01:45,899 --> 01:01:47,917
What do you think?

981
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:50,816
It's like at a department store,
isn't it JT?

982
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:52,669
We're so <i>happy</i>.

983
01:01:52,993 --> 01:01:55,668
It's like the old days
when Miriam lived here.

984
01:01:55,669 --> 01:01:58,822
This house has been dark
far too long.

985
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,583
It's incredible.

986
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:19,242
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way...

987
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:22,665
...did you file these faxes
without even looking at 'em?

988
01:02:22,665 --> 01:02:24,699
Your the fax man, Howie,

989
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,573
I figured you'd get around
to the job sooner or later.

990
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:29,924
I've got a job for you, too.

991
01:02:30,024 --> 01:02:31,353
Oohh...

992
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:32,977
what's in the box?

993
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:35,766
Well, you know Mr. Dearborne
moved to California with his nephew...

994
01:02:35,766 --> 01:02:39,133
Did you know there was Winter
Carnival in Marshall last week?

995
01:02:39,144 --> 01:02:41,231
Yes, but what does that
have to do with this?

996
01:02:41,231 --> 01:02:43,565
Well, remember every Christmas Eve

997
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:46,062
he used to be our Santa
here at the station.

998
01:02:46,086 --> 01:02:47,286
Right.

999
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:54,910
No.

1000
01:02:54,923 --> 01:02:57,382
- No, no, no...
- Yes, yes, yes..

1001
01:02:57,582 --> 01:02:58,882
Oh, n-no.

1002
01:02:58,906 --> 01:03:01,506
Please... come on,
we'll get you some padding,

1003
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:04,130
we'll glue on a beard,
no one will ever guess.

1004
01:03:04,182 --> 01:03:07,939
Sadie, I... don't you think Santa's
more... more of a Howie thing?

1005
01:03:07,939 --> 01:03:10,081
I'm allergic to the fur, big guy.

1006
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:11,306
Sadie, I can't.

1007
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:13,030
Pretty sure they were...

1008
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:14,754
Ow!

1009
01:03:14,906 --> 01:03:17,276
No, no, not the fax,
I got it, a perfect... ohhh...

1010
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:21,075
Forget the coffee and concentrate
on the names of your reindeer.

1011
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:23,675
The kids expect
that sort of thing.

1012
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:26,979
Repeat after me:

1013
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,003
- Dasher.
- Dasher.

1014
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:30,890
- Dancer.
- Dancer.

1015
01:03:30,914 --> 01:03:32,614
<i>- Prancer.
- Prancer.</i>

1016
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:43,121
<i>Bethlehem Police Department.</i>

1017
01:03:46,412 --> 01:03:48,019
Oh, Berry...

1018
01:03:48,443 --> 01:03:50,143
I'm so sorry.

1019
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:52,943
<i>I have five years.</i>

1020
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:57,378
You know, the crazy thing,
I don't even blame 'em.

1021
01:03:57,478 --> 01:03:59,848
Man, I have blown it.

1022
01:04:00,248 --> 01:04:02,574
I have trashed my life.

1023
01:04:03,998 --> 01:04:05,998
Oh, my kids hate me,
don't they?

1024
01:04:06,074 --> 01:04:08,096
No, they don't.

1025
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:10,396
They talk about you every day.

1026
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,395
You're doing good.

1027
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:15,021
JT is talking a lot.

1028
01:04:15,445 --> 01:04:17,145
Not just to Lani?

1029
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:19,673
No, you should hear him.

1030
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:22,697
I'm sorry...

1031
01:04:23,021 --> 01:04:25,221
<i>I didn't mean it like that.</i>

1032
01:04:25,273 --> 01:04:27,964
Take good care of 'em, ok?

1033
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,722
Yeah, you know I will.

1034
01:04:30,946 --> 01:04:32,421
Hey...

1035
01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:34,713
I love you.

1036
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:38,657
And I love them, you know?

1037
01:04:39,557 --> 01:04:42,155
I don't doubt that for a minute.

1038
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:47,210
I just keep telling myself...

1039
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:49,621
that all of this...

1040
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:51,845
I'm missing them.

1041
01:04:56,419 --> 01:04:59,833
Just surprised I got a pick
from that thing up, you know?

1042
01:04:59,933 --> 01:05:01,439
<i>One minute.</i>

1043
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:03,763
Hey, I gotta go, um...

1044
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:07,332
Listen, you gotta be careful because
they've been asking about you.

1045
01:05:07,456 --> 01:05:11,010
I told them that I have no idea
where you are, which is true, so...

1046
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,331
it's good that I don't but...

1047
01:05:13,331 --> 01:05:15,818
just... be safe, ok?

1048
01:05:16,018 --> 01:05:17,266
<i>Ok.</i>

1049
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,890
- Do me a favour?
- <i>Sure.</i>

1050
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:26,027
Will you give 'em a kiss tonight and...

1051
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:28,351
tell him it's from me?

1052
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:30,973
Yeah, of course I will.

1053
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,121
Ok.

1054
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:37,745
<i>Bye.</i>

1055
01:05:38,169 --> 01:05:39,569
See ya.

1056
01:05:54,741 --> 01:05:57,478
- You get through ok?
- <i>Fine, thanks.</i>

1057
01:05:58,078 --> 01:06:00,934
I've got, uh, 200 more for ya...

1058
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:04,233
the rest will be coming soon.

1059
01:06:04,473 --> 01:06:06,356
I wasn't worried.

1060
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,380
Me and the car sort of
bonded through all of this.

1061
01:06:10,419 --> 01:06:13,385
By the time I'm finished, she'll do
more than start and go for you,

1062
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:14,923
she'll purr.

1063
01:06:15,023 --> 01:06:16,814
When you need her back?

1064
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:19,876
Oh, well, we're leaving in a week,
so, anytime before that.

1065
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:21,996
Sorry to hear it happen.

1066
01:06:22,196 --> 01:06:24,917
We were kind of hoping
the town would grow on you.

1067
01:06:25,717 --> 01:06:28,595
Best you gotta do
what you gotta do, huh?

1068
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:31,368
Yeah.

1069
01:07:46,873 --> 01:07:48,364
Library.

1070
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:31,404
May I help you?

1071
01:08:32,528 --> 01:08:33,728
Yeah.

1072
01:08:33,752 --> 01:08:35,952
I don't know what this is.

1073
01:08:39,276 --> 01:08:40,976
This is a book.

1074
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,800
Actually, it's a wonderful book.
You haven't you read it?

1075
01:08:47,948 --> 01:08:50,028
I'll have to answer that.

1076
01:08:50,052 --> 01:08:51,628
But you'll find it,

1077
01:08:51,652 --> 01:08:54,952
right over there on that
third set of shelves.

1078
01:08:54,976 --> 01:08:57,776
That section's in
alphabetical order, ok?

1079
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,200
- Ok, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1080
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:40,637
Anything is...

1081
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,025
poss...

1082
01:09:42,026 --> 01:09:43,364
Possible.

1083
01:09:44,488 --> 01:09:46,788
Anything is possible.

1084
01:09:47,264 --> 01:09:49,103
It's not true.

1085
01:09:51,327 --> 01:09:53,327
Why do you say that?

1086
01:09:53,495 --> 01:09:55,023
I just know.

1087
01:09:55,747 --> 01:09:57,347
Well, this book...

1088
01:09:57,471 --> 01:09:59,522
is about things that weren't possible

1089
01:09:59,523 --> 01:10:02,137
and how they happened after all.

1090
01:10:03,737 --> 01:10:05,297
You know...

1091
01:10:06,487 --> 01:10:08,527
when I was your age,

1092
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:11,426
I went to Mars, did you know that?

1093
01:10:11,527 --> 01:10:12,695
- No you didn't.
- Yeah...

1094
01:10:12,695 --> 01:10:15,049
I took a submarine ride
to the bottom of the sea,

1095
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:17,622
and I joined a pirate crew

1096
01:10:17,622 --> 01:10:20,423
in a hunt for buried treasure just...

1097
01:10:20,423 --> 01:10:21,779
like the treasure hunt

1098
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:24,204
you were on,
that brought you here,

1099
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,791
and I did it all in books.

1100
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:29,469
Because of books...

1101
01:10:29,493 --> 01:10:31,893
Anything is possible.

1102
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:45,457
<i>When... M-Mary Lennox...</i>

1103
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:47,781
<i>was sent to...</i>

1104
01:10:47,805 --> 01:10:51,105
<i>...the master of Misselthwaite...</i>

1105
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:54,981
...and looked, as many of them
had never seen him

1106
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:58,891
and by his side with
his head up in the air

1107
01:10:58,891 --> 01:11:02,202
and his eyes full of l-laughter,

1108
01:11:02,702 --> 01:11:06,268
walked as strongly and steadily

1109
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:09,167
as any boy in Yorksh-Yorkshire.

1110
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:12,231
Master Colin.

1111
01:11:13,122 --> 01:11:14,659
Oh, that is fantastic.

1112
01:11:14,659 --> 01:11:15,944
Proud of you.

1113
01:11:15,968 --> 01:11:17,543
Oh, it's just beautiful,
just beautiful.

1114
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:19,725
<i>Agatha it's only a story.</i>

1115
01:11:19,925 --> 01:11:22,623
She cries at
supermarket openings.

1116
01:11:23,823 --> 01:11:26,475
This is the best book I ever read.

1117
01:11:26,475 --> 01:11:29,170
Yep, and there are plenty more
where that came from.

1118
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:31,982
Nathan says Santa might
give me a book of my own

1119
01:11:31,982 --> 01:11:34,006
when we see him
Christmas Eve.

1120
01:11:34,006 --> 01:11:38,299
Well, I'm sure if you want a book
for Christmas you'll get one but...

1121
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:41,034
you know, we won't be here then.

1122
01:11:41,034 --> 01:11:43,632
We're leaving the day after
tomorrow, remember?

1123
01:11:44,232 --> 01:11:45,349
<i>No.</i>

1124
01:11:45,373 --> 01:11:47,648
<i>Alanna, you know we have to go.</i>

1125
01:11:47,749 --> 01:11:49,229
No!

1126
01:11:52,353 --> 01:11:55,253
You promised her Santa
on Christmas Eve.

1127
01:11:55,746 --> 01:11:58,268
How could you give her that hope?

1128
01:11:58,268 --> 01:12:00,914
You hadn't said anything more
about leaving, I thought maybe...

1129
01:12:00,914 --> 01:12:02,530
We talked about it.

1130
01:12:02,654 --> 01:12:04,254
We had a deal.

1131
01:12:07,753 --> 01:12:08,794
Emilie.

1132
01:12:08,818 --> 01:12:10,918
I'm going to get my daughter.

1133
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:13,164
- I'll come with you.
- No, please.

1134
01:12:17,935 --> 01:12:19,140
Alanna!

1135
01:12:21,264 --> 01:12:22,464
Alanna!

1136
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:32,588
Alanna!

1137
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,580
Lani?

1138
01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:40,617
Hey.

1139
01:12:41,141 --> 01:12:43,141
Don't make us go.

1140
01:12:44,365 --> 01:12:46,465
<i>Don't make us go.</i>

1141
01:12:49,789 --> 01:12:50,989
Here.

1142
01:12:52,392 --> 01:12:54,502
But that's what you wanted.

1143
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:56,620
It's not what I want anymore.

1144
01:12:56,620 --> 01:13:00,492
I want to stay here where
it's nice and people like me.

1145
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:06,273
- We have a bedroom and a house.
- A house that's not ours.

1146
01:13:06,638 --> 01:13:10,213
I mean, Mr. Foster's gonna come back
and he knows we have no right to it.

1147
01:13:10,413 --> 01:13:12,951
Maybe we could fool him too.

1148
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:16,611
Well, what if we could? I mean...

1149
01:13:16,811 --> 01:13:19,464
what kind of life would
that be, you know?

1150
01:13:19,764 --> 01:13:22,056
It'd be better
than what we had...

1151
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,955
running all the time...

1152
01:13:23,979 --> 01:13:26,179
sleeping in shelters and...

1153
01:13:27,556 --> 01:13:29,037
Nathan's nice.

1154
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:32,299
You could marry him
and we could be a family.

1155
01:13:32,499 --> 01:13:35,107
Maybe you could adopt us?

1156
01:13:39,029 --> 01:13:41,072
It's just...

1157
01:13:41,272 --> 01:13:43,165
not possible.

1158
01:13:43,565 --> 01:13:47,210
Anything is possible,
Nathan said so.

1159
01:13:47,434 --> 01:13:48,634
Hmm.

1160
01:13:49,434 --> 01:13:50,934
Come here.

1161
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:06,887
Sorry it took so long.

1162
01:14:06,911 --> 01:14:09,211
But I think you'll be
happy with the work.

1163
01:14:09,335 --> 01:14:11,811
I just hate to think
that I'm the one

1164
01:14:11,835 --> 01:14:14,334
making it possible for you to leave.

1165
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:20,735
Well, if it wasn't in this car,
it'd have to be some other way.

1166
01:14:21,059 --> 01:14:22,459
Thank you.

1167
01:14:22,483 --> 01:14:23,783
You're welcome.

1168
01:14:27,707 --> 01:14:30,507
- Ahh, like a kitten.
- Haha.

1169
01:14:30,531 --> 01:14:32,131
Didn't I tell you?

1170
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:33,755
Thank you.

1171
01:14:34,579 --> 01:14:35,779
Bye.

1172
01:14:44,487 --> 01:14:45,587
No.

1173
01:14:45,612 --> 01:14:48,044
Christmas without a snowstorm.

1174
01:14:48,044 --> 01:14:50,107
I've never seen the likes of it here.

1175
01:14:50,107 --> 01:14:52,409
At ten miles out
snow's deep as a Blue Ox.

1176
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:54,476
But here in Bethlehem?

1177
01:14:55,076 --> 01:14:57,097
Go figure Maeve.

1178
01:14:58,221 --> 01:15:00,021
Go figure is right.

1179
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:07,708
It doesn't make sense, Emilie.

1180
01:15:08,308 --> 01:15:10,434
The kids are both
doing fine here,

1181
01:15:10,434 --> 01:15:12,857
they're doing better,
they're fine, we're fine here.

1182
01:15:12,957 --> 01:15:14,543
We agreed it
would be two weeks.

1183
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:17,130
I know what we said but tell me...

1184
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:21,717
tell me nothing has happened in that
time to make you change your mind.

1185
01:15:21,801 --> 01:15:22,900
Ohh...

1186
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:25,301
no, a lot has happened...

1187
01:15:25,472 --> 01:15:28,757
and I've never felt as loved
as you've made me feel.

1188
01:15:29,781 --> 01:15:31,781
And wherever I go,

1189
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:33,905
that will go with me.

1190
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:35,829
And, uh...

1191
01:15:36,653 --> 01:15:38,153
thank you.

1192
01:15:39,677 --> 01:15:42,277
Thank you doesn't even come close.

1193
01:15:43,201 --> 01:15:44,701
But, uh...

1194
01:15:44,725 --> 01:15:46,756
I have to go now.

1195
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,280
Because it's only
gonna get harder for me.

1196
01:15:50,904 --> 01:15:53,604
No, no, Nathan, this is magic.

1197
01:15:54,328 --> 01:15:56,728
But the thing about magic,

1198
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:59,052
is that it isn't real.

1199
01:16:00,576 --> 01:16:02,376
In your experience.

1200
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,000
Yeah, it's all I have to go by.

1201
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:08,334
You're running away.

1202
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:11,949
You're running away to save yourself
from <i>maybe</i> getting hurt.

1203
01:16:12,049 --> 01:16:14,355
Now, that does not make sense.

1204
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:18,379
Well, to me it does.

1205
01:16:38,019 --> 01:16:40,472
<i>I'm sorry to hear you're
leaving in the morning.</i>

1206
01:16:40,472 --> 01:16:43,905
See, I was hoping to introduce
you to the local Historical Society.

1207
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:46,794
And my uncle was really looking
forward to saying hello again.

1208
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:49,856
Yeah, I know we're just missing him
but you know, we really have to...

1209
01:16:49,942 --> 01:16:52,838
No, no, no, you're not just
missing him. Didn't you hear?

1210
01:16:52,892 --> 01:16:55,319
The Boston Airport was
snowed in last night.

1211
01:16:57,219 --> 01:16:59,681
So he's not coming home
for Christmas?

1212
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,050
Not unless it's by dog sled.

1213
01:17:02,074 --> 01:17:04,274
This is really good coffee.

1214
01:17:04,298 --> 01:17:05,718
Ohh...

1215
01:17:06,819 --> 01:17:09,009
Have another cup.

1216
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:11,651
You know what, have
the whole pot if you like.

1217
01:17:11,651 --> 01:17:14,202
Mr. Foster? I think I love you.

1218
01:17:18,502 --> 01:17:20,957
So, I wanted to tell you,
that I know two kids

1219
01:17:20,957 --> 01:17:23,670
that are gonna get
to meet Santa tomorrow.

1220
01:17:23,951 --> 01:17:25,069
No, no.

1221
01:17:25,193 --> 01:17:26,392
Here?

1222
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:27,816
- Yeah?
- Yes!

1223
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,840
Yes! Yes!

1224
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,140
Yes, you bet you will, tomorrow

1225
01:17:32,293 --> 01:17:34,593
you and he are gonna be
the best of friends.

1226
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,460
<i>...and a computer game...</i>

1227
01:17:46,485 --> 01:17:49,176
and a space fighter
and a new basketball...

1228
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,500
No, whoa, whoa, whoa...

1229
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:51,860
I'll tell you what young man.

1230
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,585
You write out that list and
mail it to me at the North Pole

1231
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,131
and then I'll see what I can do.

1232
01:17:56,231 --> 01:17:58,751
- But Christmas is tomorrow morning.
- Yes.

1233
01:17:58,751 --> 01:18:02,579
And that's why we should always plan
ahead. Merry Christmas. Yes, ho, ho, yes...

1234
01:18:04,603 --> 01:18:06,103
<i>Hello young man.</i>

1235
01:18:09,846 --> 01:18:10,962
Oh!

1236
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,986
Haha, I think I know you...
hoho...

1237
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,920
<i>There you go.</i>

1238
01:18:16,944 --> 01:18:18,343
Wait your turn.

1239
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:20,519
Well, who do we have here?

1240
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:21,895
A...

1241
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,773
couple kids who've waited all their
lives to see you Santa. And a...

1242
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:28,455
woman who's as
happy as the kids are.

1243
01:18:28,455 --> 01:18:29,946
Can I go first?

1244
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:32,055
Yes, of course, get up there.

1245
01:18:32,255 --> 01:18:33,744
Ho, ho, ho...

1246
01:18:33,768 --> 01:18:35,468
sit right up here, hu, hu.

1247
01:18:39,144 --> 01:18:40,964
I love you.

1248
01:18:41,688 --> 01:18:43,188
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1249
01:19:00,028 --> 01:19:02,802
Kids are going through these
things like they're candy.

1250
01:19:03,902 --> 01:19:06,197
What you got there?

1251
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:16,795
It's a book!

1252
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,886
It's about a horse.

1253
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:24,585
And the horse wrote it himself.

1254
01:19:25,586 --> 01:19:28,307
I guess anything's possible, right?

1255
01:19:29,207 --> 01:19:30,914
Merry Christmas, Alanna.

1256
01:19:30,914 --> 01:19:32,318
Thank you.

1257
01:19:33,642 --> 01:19:35,342
Your turn, go.

1258
01:19:35,366 --> 01:19:36,909
Come up and see me, young man.

1259
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,179
Hm-hm... oh.

1260
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,378
Ohhh...

1261
01:19:40,903 --> 01:19:43,903
What do you want Santa
to bring to you, huh, JT?

1262
01:19:45,427 --> 01:19:47,927
<i>It's a secret and I can't tell.</i>

1263
01:19:49,106 --> 01:19:50,506
Wow...

1264
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:52,130
Oh.

1265
01:19:52,631 --> 01:19:56,616
Oh, isn't Nathan adorable? I have to
get a picture of him with the kids.

1266
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,728
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1267
01:19:57,729 --> 01:20:00,149
I've got a picture for you, but...

1268
01:20:00,873 --> 01:20:03,073
not the one you want.

1269
01:20:07,049 --> 01:20:09,679
Tell me there's been some mistake.

1270
01:20:09,879 --> 01:20:13,620
Yeah, no, uh, I can explain,
please, you have to believe me.

1271
01:20:13,718 --> 01:20:16,711
If you could please, please,
just, just tear it up and...

1272
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:19,335
I will tell you everything, ok?

1273
01:20:22,335 --> 01:20:25,051
I want to see my mama
for Christmas.

1274
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:28,626
Well, that's an easy one...

1275
01:20:29,926 --> 01:20:32,190
she's right over there.

1276
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,745
That's not my real mama.

1277
01:20:53,574 --> 01:20:55,446
Where are the kids?

1278
01:20:55,546 --> 01:20:57,460
Do they know what happened?

1279
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,858
The sisters are
taking care of them

1280
01:20:58,882 --> 01:21:01,182
until the social worker from
Providence gets here.

1281
01:21:01,258 --> 01:21:03,201
Should be within the hour.

1282
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,901
You can't do this to them.

1283
01:21:06,677 --> 01:21:08,604
How long did you think
you could hide here?

1284
01:21:08,604 --> 01:21:10,916
Because what I've heard
about your aunt Miriam and...

1285
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:13,312
if she was still alive today
to see what you've become...

1286
01:21:13,312 --> 01:21:14,745
I made a mistake.

1287
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,844
I lied, I misled you.

1288
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:19,496
But I did not have a choice.

1289
01:21:19,596 --> 01:21:21,864
Everybody has a choice.

1290
01:21:22,464 --> 01:21:25,465
No. Not everybody has that luxury.

1291
01:21:25,565 --> 01:21:27,699
It killed me to lie,

1292
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:30,539
but if it meant keeping those kids safe,

1293
01:21:30,739 --> 01:21:33,321
I would do it again in a heartbeat.

1294
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:37,118
I never lied about
my feelings for you,

1295
01:21:37,318 --> 01:21:38,987
not one word.

1296
01:21:40,511 --> 01:21:42,811
Please, you have to believe that.

1297
01:21:46,587 --> 01:21:48,767
Gerald Foster is here.

1298
01:21:50,349 --> 01:21:52,354
Do you believe me?

1299
01:21:52,354 --> 01:21:55,274
Maybe I'll have better luck
with your attorney.

1300
01:21:55,274 --> 01:21:57,168
Send him in, please.

1301
01:21:57,368 --> 01:21:58,853
Mr. Foster.

1302
01:21:59,077 --> 01:22:01,177
You're gonna need that suit.

1303
01:22:02,453 --> 01:22:04,729
Ah, seems I got here
just in time.

1304
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:08,183
I hear Miriam's niece has
gotten into some trouble.

1305
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:09,814
Well...

1306
01:22:10,038 --> 01:22:12,038
ask her yourself.

1307
01:22:13,514 --> 01:22:15,154
Well, where is she?

1308
01:22:15,154 --> 01:22:17,952
Oh, don't tell me you
put her behind bars?

1309
01:22:22,525 --> 01:22:24,827
I can explain that too.

1310
01:22:27,027 --> 01:22:30,822
That impostor has been living
in Miriam's house all this time?

1311
01:22:31,122 --> 01:22:33,292
Said she was the niece

1312
01:22:33,292 --> 01:22:34,970
and the name on the probate...

1313
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:36,984
Well, it wasn't Emilie Thompson,
I can tell you that.

1314
01:22:36,984 --> 01:22:38,987
I saw the name, Mr. Foster,
with my own eyes.

1315
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,844
The new clerk,
the woman over there,

1316
01:22:40,844 --> 01:22:42,719
showed me the records herself.

1317
01:22:42,919 --> 01:22:44,316
What new clerk?

1318
01:22:44,316 --> 01:22:46,030
It's just Hank, like it's always been.

1319
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:48,496
Oh, sounds like it's all
part of a bigger scam.

1320
01:22:49,013 --> 01:22:52,265
They probably stripped the house
of everything of value.

1321
01:22:59,434 --> 01:23:01,548
I gotta get a move on.

1322
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:04,932
The line of kids stretching halfway
to Peterman's hardware.

1323
01:23:17,732 --> 01:23:20,408
Mr. Foster is here to see ya.

1324
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,849
You up to it?

1325
01:23:26,073 --> 01:23:28,373
Might as well get it over with.

1326
01:23:35,922 --> 01:23:37,509
<i>Alexander?</i>

1327
01:23:37,533 --> 01:23:39,133
I came to help.

1328
01:23:39,157 --> 01:23:40,808
To help me?

1329
01:23:40,809 --> 01:23:43,774
Yeah. Seems  like you need someone
in your corner right about now.

1330
01:23:43,874 --> 01:23:45,485
<i>Oh, I do...</i>

1331
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:47,284
but your uncle is...

1332
01:23:47,285 --> 01:23:48,776
My uncle...

1333
01:23:49,076 --> 01:23:50,771
we go to the same family dinners but

1334
01:23:50,771 --> 01:23:54,021
that's where the resemblance
ends. And me...

1335
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:57,233
I like to know all the facts
before I take sides.

1336
01:23:57,257 --> 01:23:58,432
Mmm...

1337
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:00,059
I'm glad.

1338
01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:03,411
You won't find anything missing, Gerald.

1339
01:24:03,411 --> 01:24:05,890
Where's Miriam's good silver?

1340
01:24:05,914 --> 01:24:08,514
In the pantry,
where it's always been.

1341
01:24:11,459 --> 01:24:12,857
Well?

1342
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,681
No, no, she lied to us.

1343
01:24:14,857 --> 01:24:17,340
She lied to all of us.
You, me, the whole town.

1344
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,469
- Did you ask her why?
- It doesn't matter.

1345
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:22,703
The ends don't justify the means.

1346
01:24:22,703 --> 01:24:25,794
Not in the eyes of the law
perhaps, but still...

1347
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:29,921
She and those kids brought more life
to this house than it's known for years.

1348
01:24:30,355 --> 01:24:32,846
- <i>She brought life to you, too.</i>
- Huh.

1349
01:24:32,846 --> 01:24:35,190
My life was just fine
before she got to Bethlehem.

1350
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:37,854
Oh yes, of course,
you had your work...

1351
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:39,704
and you had us...

1352
01:24:39,728 --> 01:24:42,228
and you had your work.

1353
01:24:44,952 --> 01:24:46,352
It was enough.

1354
01:24:46,404 --> 01:24:48,437
Then you're too easily satisfied.

1355
01:24:48,437 --> 01:24:50,892
Now don't argue with me
because I know these things.

1356
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:53,795
Now, you need someone to love,
who loves you right back.

1357
01:24:53,859 --> 01:24:56,587
And you can't tell me
that's not Emilie.

1358
01:24:58,187 --> 01:25:01,041
I better check on
Corinna and the children.

1359
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:04,249
They're starting to wonder
about their mother...

1360
01:25:07,073 --> 01:25:08,773
about Emilie.

1361
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:15,056
- Did you find the silver?
- What about her good jewellery?

1362
01:25:15,339 --> 01:25:17,827
In her dresser, bottom drawer.

1363
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:20,051
Where it's <i>always</i> been.

1364
01:25:33,331 --> 01:25:35,550
I don't know about the rest of you but

1365
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:38,435
this is not the way
I imagined my Christmas Eve.

1366
01:25:38,535 --> 01:25:42,058
I appreciate you making yourself
available to us, Judge Jakes.

1367
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:45,828
I'd like to settle this matter and get
the children back to Providence tonight.

1368
01:25:45,901 --> 01:25:48,028
And I'd like an all-expense-paid
trip to Bermuda,

1369
01:25:48,028 --> 01:25:50,258
that is not likely to happen.

1370
01:25:50,658 --> 01:25:53,353
Now, I've... looked over these charges,
I've read your report.

1371
01:25:53,353 --> 01:25:56,366
Yes, yes, you'll see that I've
included the history of neglect

1372
01:25:56,553 --> 01:25:58,674
and the request for state custody.

1373
01:25:58,774 --> 01:26:02,870
What part of "I read your report"
did you not understand, Ms Doyle?

1374
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,533
Now, Ms Thompson...

1375
01:26:06,557 --> 01:26:09,607
seems to me, like you've been
a very busy woman.

1376
01:26:09,608 --> 01:26:11,502
Wh... objection Your Honour.

1377
01:26:11,702 --> 01:26:14,127
The charges against my client
are only alleged.

1378
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,688
Overruled.

1379
01:26:17,788 --> 01:26:20,831
This isn't a trial
but I like saying that.

1380
01:26:22,531 --> 01:26:25,849
Sit down! Before I remember
what a pain you were to babysit.

1381
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,930
May I say something?

1382
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:32,502
Well... never found a way
to stop you, go ahead.

1383
01:26:32,702 --> 01:26:35,385
Uh, Nathan Blair,
the arresting officer

1384
01:26:35,385 --> 01:26:38,203
can verify each and every charge
against the defendant.

1385
01:26:38,203 --> 01:26:41,845
<i>Nathan...</i> finally a voice of reason.
Where is he?

1386
01:26:43,989 --> 01:26:47,099
He, uh, he <i>intends</i> to be here,
Your Honour.

1387
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:50,632
And I <i>intend</i> to get back to
my dinner before midnight.

1388
01:26:50,832 --> 01:26:54,321
So, anyone got anything
relevant to say?

1389
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:56,992
I, um...

1390
01:26:57,516 --> 01:26:59,616
<i>I do, Your Honour.</i>

1391
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:02,349
You have something to say,
say it.

1392
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:05,087
<i>Think before you speak,
Alexander.</i>

1393
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:06,693
Well, um...

1394
01:27:08,417 --> 01:27:11,217
I would like to cite
the case, um, of...

1395
01:27:11,841 --> 01:27:14,741
Sheffield vs. Lewis 1972.

1396
01:27:15,193 --> 01:27:17,637
<i>Ah, you see, in this case,</i>

1397
01:27:17,661 --> 01:27:21,061
it's, it's very clear
that there's this man...

1398
01:27:21,619 --> 01:27:25,400
woman, named, um, Mrs. Lewis...

1399
01:27:40,204 --> 01:27:42,693
It's not gonna drink itself.

1400
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:48,517
Something on your mind tonight?

1401
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:51,537
A woman, I bet.

1402
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:54,361
How'd you guess?

1403
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:57,862
It's a bar, the odds are with me.

1404
01:28:00,309 --> 01:28:03,363
- Hey, are...?
- <i>Everybody</i> looks like somebody.

1405
01:28:05,563 --> 01:28:07,987
You want to tell me about it?

1406
01:28:09,287 --> 01:28:10,959
Not particularly.

1407
01:28:13,183 --> 01:28:14,983
You fell in love.

1408
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:17,643
You know, you're very good at this.

1409
01:28:17,643 --> 01:28:19,947
Did she love you back?

1410
01:28:20,071 --> 01:28:22,071
I thought so.

1411
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:25,903
She was just makin' a fool out of me.

1412
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,710
It's complicated.

1413
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:33,156
That drink will only, uh,
complicate it more.

1414
01:28:34,956 --> 01:28:36,233
Ok...

1415
01:28:36,657 --> 01:28:38,757
you're the expert.

1416
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:40,983
What do you think will help?

1417
01:28:41,283 --> 01:28:43,394
She made a mistake.

1418
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:44,918
I'd say...

1419
01:28:45,642 --> 01:28:47,893
- forgive her.
- Ha ha ha.

1420
01:28:48,494 --> 01:28:50,829
I wish it were that easy.

1421
01:28:51,253 --> 01:28:53,653
You never made a mistake?

1422
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:56,261
Not like this one.

1423
01:28:56,661 --> 01:28:59,366
<i>Well, I'd hope you'd be more original.</i>

1424
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:04,690
All of us make our own mistakes
in our own ways.

1425
01:29:05,066 --> 01:29:08,494
But in every case,
the solution is the same.

1426
01:29:11,694 --> 01:29:13,853
I forgive you.

1427
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:19,770
There's a lot of power
in those three little words.

1428
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:22,210
They can change the world...

1429
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,785
they have.

1430
01:29:24,809 --> 01:29:26,609
But it's impossible.

1431
01:29:26,633 --> 01:29:29,184
As a wise man once said:

1432
01:29:29,585 --> 01:29:32,019
"anything is possible".

1433
01:29:46,643 --> 01:29:48,243
Wha...?

1434
01:29:59,562 --> 01:30:03,182
Yes. She told us to lie
and she said it was a game.

1435
01:30:03,282 --> 01:30:05,767
And how did you feel
about  that, Alanna?

1436
01:30:05,816 --> 01:30:07,115
Well...

1437
01:30:07,139 --> 01:30:09,739
at least we got food to eat
and a place to sleep.

1438
01:30:09,815 --> 01:30:11,849
Is that how she
got you to lie?

1439
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:15,703
Ms Doyle, if you want to interrupt, may
I suggest you get your own courtroom!

1440
01:30:18,938 --> 01:30:21,351
Did she let you go hungry, child?

1441
01:30:21,651 --> 01:30:22,873
- No, I never...
- No.

1442
01:30:22,897 --> 01:30:24,897
Not aunt Emilie. No.

1443
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:27,921
But before, my mum...

1444
01:30:28,045 --> 01:30:30,045
my real mum...

1445
01:30:30,273 --> 01:30:31,861
she ran out of money

1446
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:35,285
and we'd get so hungry,
me and my brother.

1447
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,649
She didn't care,
as long as she had her drugs.

1448
01:30:38,649 --> 01:30:41,202
I know she couldn't help it but...

1449
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,763
Your Honour, please don't
make her go through this.

1450
01:30:43,763 --> 01:30:45,999
Do what you want with me
but these kids,

1451
01:30:45,999 --> 01:30:48,524
they have gone through
so much already.

1452
01:30:55,431 --> 01:30:58,341
Do you mind going on, sweetheart?

1453
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:00,166
<i>It's important.</i>

1454
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:02,990
Once, my brother...

1455
01:31:03,066 --> 01:31:06,457
he cried so hard,
he started to choke

1456
01:31:07,057 --> 01:31:09,739
<i>and... and I didn't
know what to do...</i>

1457
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:14,366
and I tried to wake mum up
but she used to...

1458
01:31:14,366 --> 01:31:17,207
I-I couldn't wake her up and...

1459
01:31:17,207 --> 01:31:20,100
and there was nobody
around to help my brother

1460
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,525
and I thought he was gonna die

1461
01:31:22,549 --> 01:31:24,511
and I didn't know what to do.

1462
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:27,179
Don't cry Lani, I'm ok.

1463
01:31:30,779 --> 01:31:32,616
<i>All we want...</i>

1464
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,740
is to stay together in one place...

1465
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,134
with someone who loves us.

1466
01:31:40,634 --> 01:31:43,708
<i>Someone who talks soft to us
when we're scared,</i>

1467
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:46,593
says that everything's gonna be ok.

1468
01:31:47,117 --> 01:31:49,617
Like aunt Emilie does.

1469
01:31:49,993 --> 01:31:52,264
<i>She loves us.</i>

1470
01:31:52,664 --> 01:31:56,292
Please don't make her go to jail,
she doesn't belong there.

1471
01:31:56,792 --> 01:32:00,268
I know... 'cause my real mum does.

1472
01:32:01,368 --> 01:32:02,878
<i>I understand...</i>

1473
01:32:02,902 --> 01:32:05,202
why you feel like that now.

1474
01:32:05,578 --> 01:32:08,592
Your mother needs help
and she's getting that.

1475
01:32:08,792 --> 01:32:11,592
Things will get better with time.

1476
01:32:12,192 --> 01:32:15,707
Someday, you and your brother
will be able to love her again.

1477
01:32:16,007 --> 01:32:18,798
I'm sure we all agree that this child

1478
01:32:18,798 --> 01:32:21,311
has suffered enough and I'm sure that

1479
01:32:21,311 --> 01:32:23,874
Miss Thompson means well
but her actions...

1480
01:32:23,974 --> 01:32:25,426
Your Honour?

1481
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:28,650
Could I have a few words here?

1482
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:37,610
Hey.

1483
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:43,023
Hey, can you guys
go outside with Sadie?

1484
01:32:43,147 --> 01:32:44,947
Just for a little bit?

1485
01:32:54,423 --> 01:32:57,093
Your Honour,
Mr Blair knows more than anyone,

1486
01:32:57,166 --> 01:33:00,491
how Miss Thompson operates.
How she lied repeatedly

1487
01:33:00,525 --> 01:33:02,509
and how she impersonated
another woman

1488
01:33:02,509 --> 01:33:04,942
in order to deceive this whole town.

1489
01:33:04,942 --> 01:33:06,188
Nathan?

1490
01:33:06,212 --> 01:33:08,312
That's true, Your Honour.

1491
01:33:09,088 --> 01:33:12,934
I'm convinced this woman would
do or say just about anything

1492
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:14,596
to get what she wanted.

1493
01:33:14,596 --> 01:33:16,399
So you see judge...

1494
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:20,725
What she wanted was to give those
children a chance at a decent life.

1495
01:33:21,502 --> 01:33:24,943
Oh, she lied, to put a roof
over their heads...

1496
01:33:25,343 --> 01:33:28,486
and-and in a world that wanted
to pull that family apart,

1497
01:33:28,486 --> 01:33:31,568
she lied to keep them together.
Now...

1498
01:33:31,889 --> 01:33:35,189
I'm not saying that
lying's ever right but...

1499
01:33:36,965 --> 01:33:39,103
but in her position...

1500
01:33:39,727 --> 01:33:42,527
<i>I'd like to think
I'd do the same thing.</i>

1501
01:33:44,592 --> 01:33:47,643
Emilie Thompson
is the most loving woman.

1502
01:33:48,143 --> 01:33:50,726
<i>She's the best mother I've ever seen.</i>

1503
01:33:50,726 --> 01:33:52,967
And all she needed was a...

1504
01:33:52,991 --> 01:33:55,466
was a support system
that worked for her...

1505
01:33:55,467 --> 01:33:57,341
Your Honour, I have to protest...

1506
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:59,295
But he's your witness, Ms Doyle.

1507
01:33:59,295 --> 01:34:01,422
now she's got one...

1508
01:34:01,646 --> 01:34:03,846
<i>if she'll accept it.</i>

1509
01:34:04,322 --> 01:34:07,558
Where she belongs here in Bethlehem.

1510
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:11,040
And the kids
belong with her.

1511
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,050
She doesn't even
have a place to live.

1512
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,926
Yes, she does...

1513
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,450
she can live with me.

1514
01:34:17,926 --> 01:34:20,079
<i>if she'll forgive me...</i>

1515
01:34:20,179 --> 01:34:22,208
<i>and if she'll have me...</i>

1516
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:25,332
because the truth is, I love her...

1517
01:34:30,258 --> 01:34:32,520
and I want to marry her.

1518
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,922
What's happening?

1519
01:34:45,922 --> 01:34:48,126
I don't know, I can't hear them.

1520
01:34:50,450 --> 01:34:53,950
I think we should let them
handle this alone for now.

1521
01:34:53,974 --> 01:34:55,374
Come on.

1522
01:35:01,743 --> 01:35:04,178
- She took the children without
any authorisation.  - <i>She...</i>

1523
01:35:05,178 --> 01:35:07,358
<i>What about the breaking and entering?</i>

1524
01:35:07,382 --> 01:35:09,682
<i>...she used the house
without permission...</i>

1525
01:35:09,683 --> 01:35:10,807
Shh. Quiet.

1526
01:35:10,832 --> 01:35:13,663
Can I get semblance of order here?!

1527
01:35:13,687 --> 01:35:15,587
QUIET!

1528
01:35:17,563 --> 01:35:19,865
I've come to a decision.

1529
01:35:23,779 --> 01:35:24,964
Kids!

1530
01:35:25,188 --> 01:35:27,188
They've stopped talking?

1531
01:35:27,864 --> 01:35:30,498
You know what?
I think we can go in now.

1532
01:35:30,598 --> 01:35:32,473
Court is adjourned.

1533
01:35:42,596 --> 01:35:44,839
Congratulations. Congratulations.

1534
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,138
By the way...

1535
01:35:46,162 --> 01:35:48,062
I also do weddings.

1536
01:36:10,262 --> 01:36:12,262
Look at this?

1537
01:36:13,942 --> 01:36:15,459
It's snowing.

1538
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:31,582
<i>So this was our miracle.</i>

1539
01:36:32,282 --> 01:36:34,981
<i>This is how it happened for us.</i>

1540
01:36:38,275 --> 01:36:41,135
<i>It was the most perfect Christmas.</i>

1541
01:36:41,135 --> 01:36:42,872
<i>The best holiday ever...</i>

1542
01:36:43,072 --> 01:36:45,552
<i>and it was just beginning.</i>

1543
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:52,690
<i>Whenever we talked about it later,</i>

1544
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:55,681
<i>Emilie always said that that
season is a special season...</i>

1545
01:36:55,881 --> 01:36:58,322
<i>the season for miracles.</i>
