1
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,478
<i>My people, the Chickasaw,</i>

2
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,774
<i>were a tribe of great and mighty warriors
who lived in the southeastern woodlands,</i>

3
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:31,448
<i>but in 1837 President Jackson removed
my people from their sacred homelands.</i>

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,619
<i>My English father and Chickasaw mother</i>

5
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,789
<i>traveled the treacherous
Trail of Tears into Indian Territory.</i>

6
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,341
{\an8}<i>Once arrived, disease claimed my mother</i>

7
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>and sent her spirit along
the white dog road to join our ancestors.</i>

8
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,699
<i>My father went east
to return to his prior life,</i>

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,245
<i>promising one day to return.</i>

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,999
<i>Raised by my mother's people,</i>

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,752
<i>my sister and I struggled
to survive in two worlds.</i>

12
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,380
{\an8}<i>That of the Chickasaw who understood</i>

13
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,633
{\an8}<i>the richness and beauty</i>
<i>of this new land...</i>

14
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,802
- Papa!
- Papa!

15
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,013
Papa! Papa!

16
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,140
<i>And that of the white man</i>

17
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,060
<i>whose greed brought nothing
but death and destruction.</i>

18
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,770
OK, let's go!

19
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,855
Come on!

20
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,108
Yeah!

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,070
C'mon! C'mon!

22
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,869
Yeah! Whoo!

23
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,333
Yeah! Yeah!

24
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,503
- There we go!
- Come on, yeah, come on!

25
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,088
{\an8}Come on, let's go!

26
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,646
{\an8}Yeah, come on, let's go!

27
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,650
{\an8}Come on, giddyup!

28
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,036
{\an8}Here we go!

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,085
{\an8}Come on!

30
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,384
Here they come!

31
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,389
Pick it up, Montford.

32
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:05,184
He's gainin'! Go, go, go!

33
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,856
Move it, Michael! Come on!

34
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,443
Yes! Yes!

35
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,157
Fourth place.

36
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,202
Whoa, whoa.

37
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,999
Yeah, Jack get you a Chickasaw horse
and you might have a chance.

38
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,127
Hey, hey, hey... you just be happy
it's your wedding day.

39
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,380
We both let you win.

40
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,066
Let's go again, then.
I'll beat y'all twice.

41
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,177
You're lucky you won, Montford Johnson,
or else I might not be marrying you.

42
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,513
- Even if I got second?
- Mm-mmm.

43
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,140
That's a strong-willed woman.

44
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,644
Hey! You ain't married yet.

45
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,247
Just 'cause I married your sister
don't mean you have to marry mine.

46
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,689
Figured it was only fair.

47
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,735
First place, whoo! Enjoy it.
It's your wedding gift.

48
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,737
Keep it, soldier. I want a redo.

49
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,366
No. Y'all better get cleaned up or else
none of you's coming to my wedding.

50
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:07,121
I warned you people.
Never bet against a Chickasaw pony.

51
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,709
Oh, I've got me some wedding gifts now.

52
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,799
Hey, I only saw six head of cattle.

53
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,178
Well, Union rustlers stole five,
I gave one to Granny.

54
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,597
Should feed her through winter.

55
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,475
Shameful, someone takes away
a man's livestock,

56
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,726
he takes away everything.

57
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,370
Most folks I know are turning their cattle
loose up in the hills,

58
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,147
so them blue bellies can't find 'em.

59
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,362
Rising Wolf, my Cheyenne friend.
So glad you could make it, brother.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,698
You're a blessed man, my friend.

61
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,701
As the fires of war
rage across our lands,

62
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,913
let us celebrate the good things
that have brought us here today.

63
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,838
These gifts represent...

64
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,675
Who's that?

65
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,348
- Who is that?
- Jesse Chisholm.

66
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,564
Montford! I'm sorry,
I saw 'em coming this way.

67
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,026
I tried to talk 'em out of it
but they insisted.

68
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,698
Be careful with this commander.
They're looking for any good horses...

69
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,534
- Jack, hide the horses!
- and Confederate soldiers.

70
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,578
Adelaide, cover up Michael!

71
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,759
Whose place is this?

72
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,887
It's mine. How may we help you, Sergeant?

73
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,018
Well, I haven't killed no rebels
in almost a week now.

74
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,228
Well, you won't find any here.

75
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,980
This man a rebel, Chisholm?

76
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,066
Can't say I know him.

77
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,533
Well, looks like we got ourselves
a regular uprising going on here.

78
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,244
We got Cheyenne, Kiowa,

79
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,830
now why is it you Indians
sided with the rebs?

80
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:18,294
Could be 'cause the Union broke
every treaty it ever made with us.

81
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,671
Gets you to thinkin', don't it?

82
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,135
What's your name, Injun?

83
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,012
Montford Thomas Johnson.

84
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:33,059
Well, shoot, that ain't no
Injun name I ever heard before.

85
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,354
My mother was Chickasaw.
My father English.

86
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:41,275
That so? You must be waging
quite the internal conflict.

87
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,946
Your own personal civil war.

88
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,910
- Which side's winning?
- I'm Chickasaw.

89
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,413
Looks like you chose the wrong side.

90
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,336
Well, Mr. Montford Thomas Johnson,

91
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,630
I'm gonna search your place now,

92
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,551
and if I find one rebel on this property,
I'm gonna hang you for treason,

93
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,153
then I'm gonna shoot every other man here

94
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,179
and burn your place to the ground,
you understand?

95
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,143
Like I said, ain't no rebels here.

96
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,686
Better not be.

97
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,106
Spread out!

98
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,409
Hyah!

99
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,787
Go on, check that side. Come on!

100
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,746
Spread out!

101
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,503
You know when I was twelve,
my family moved out west

102
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,089
not too far from here.

103
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,340
Had big dreams

104
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,678
but wild Injuns didn't care
nothing about no big dreams.

105
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,805
They came in the night,

106
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,309
surrounded the caravan
and did what you wild Injuns do.

107
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,686
They kilt 'em all.

108
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,607
Except me...

109
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,360
'cause I hid under my father's dead body.

110
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,202
No horses or men, just these sorry cattle.

111
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,579
- We'll take what we can get.
- Montford! The cattle!

112
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,582
Sergeant! We depend on those!

113
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,418
Well, according to
Lieber Code, Article 39

114
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,963
marshal law extends persons and
property that are subject of the enemy.

115
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,549
That means we can take what we want.

116
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,176
Neither officers nor soldiers

117
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,763
are allowed to make use of their
position of power for private gain.

118
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,475
Article 42, Sergeant.

119
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,061
You an Injun lover?

120
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,146
Proud to say I am.

121
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,070
Well, howdy, mama.

122
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,280
C'mon on out here!

123
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,573
C'mon!

124
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,699
C'mon!

125
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,915
It's OK.
I think I could be an Injun lover too.

126
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:06,212
Sergeant! We need to move if you
wanna make the fort by sun down.

127
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,055
Move out! I'll see you soon.

128
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,359
Now get back over here,
we're gonna finish what we started.

129
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,194
They ain't ruining my day!

130
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,447
No, sir, everyone as you were, OK?

131
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,699
This is a blessed occasion

132
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,577
and I'm not gonna let
a little bit of rain spoil it.

133
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,261
Ah.

134
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,977
What you got there?

135
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,157
You know I'm always
gonna take care of you.

136
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,744
I know you will.

137
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,956
Let's go inside and you can
start taking care of your wife now.

138
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>Our Father God...</i>

139
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,971
<i>Like the spring, we are
grateful for the new blessings of life.</i>

140
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,184
Meet your son, Edward Bryant.

141
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,437
<i>We ask that you sanctify our children.</i>

142
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,982
<i>Halito</i>, Edward Bryant.

143
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,445
<i>Give them wisdom,
abundance, and love of family.</i>

144
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,574
<i>We give thanks for your Word
in this time of war</i>

145
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>that sets brother against brother,
father against son.</i>

146
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,584
You can't do this!
That's all we have! Please!

147
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,504
<i>Give your angels charge over
the protection of our people</i>

148
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,466
<i>as they fall victim
to the ravages of war.</i>

149
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,553
<i>You're the fortress against those
who seek to harm us.</i>

150
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,143
<i>You are our refuge and our strength.</i>

151
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,940
That's the last of 'em. Let's move out!

152
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,280
<i>If it is Your will that
we should sit among our ancestors,</i>

153
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,949
<i>let it be as winters rest</i>

154
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,535
<i>and in the presence of Your fire.</i>

155
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:02,638
<i>It will be that way.</i>

156
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,402
This drought is killing us.

157
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,280
Edward Bryant, come here, son.

158
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,702
One thing I learned from
the Manual Labor Academy is,

159
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,996
you gotta go deep in the ground.

160
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,039
You can't just scratch the surface.

161
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,719
Them gophers go to the academy with you?

162
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,022
Edward Bryant,

163
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,941
go on in the house. Now!

164
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,986
I got nothing left for 'em to take.

165
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,988
I got something for 'em.

166
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,911
What can I do for you?

167
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,246
This is the half-breed I told ya about.

168
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,081
Montford Johnson?

169
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,292
Yeah, that's me.

170
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,031
Lieutenant Richard Pratt.
I'm the new commander at Fort Sill.

171
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,305
You know General Lee surrendered at
Maddox Courthouse in Virginia? April 9th.

172
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,059
- War is over?
- It is indeed.

173
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,061
- Thank the good lord.
- Yes, ma'am.

174
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,687
We're all on the same side again.

175
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,315
I'd appreciate ya letting
your neighbors know.

176
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,691
Yeah, I'll let 'em know.

177
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,277
That we're on the same side.

178
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,531
Thank you.

179
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,077
Look, if you have a problem,
you come see me.

180
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,745
Ma'am.

181
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,376
Let's move out!

182
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,138
You need something?

183
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,183
Herd looks a bit thin.

184
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,853
Shame you can't provide
for your pretty wife.

185
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,649
Kind of takes away
everything it means to be a man.

186
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,361
Army's fat with cattle.

187
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,739
We'd be happy to sell it to someone
for half the wholesale price.

188
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,823
Someone meaning me?

189
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,909
Army's shifting focus.

190
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,161
Going after the wild Injuns.

191
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,288
Your kind.

192
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,166
We need eyes and ears.

193
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,003
An inside man to keep us informed.

194
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,714
You got the wrong someone.

195
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,344
- Such a nice family too.
- Pardon me?

196
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,015
You have a splendid day,
Montford Thomas Johnson.

197
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,910
That's Michael's whole life savings.

198
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,913
Confederate dollars! They're worthless.

199
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,042
We'll get through it.

200
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:23,297
I'm down to one cow.
We gotta pay Jack with something.

201
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,301
We can't lose him.

202
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,890
Papa, I'm hungry.

203
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,267
I know, son.

204
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,898
Let's find you something.

205
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:59,500
<i>Someday soon this pasture
is gonna be filled with grazing cattle</i>

206
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,794
<i>from here to the horizon and back.</i>

207
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,637
<i>And one day,
you'll have a ranch of your own</i>

208
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,181
<i>filled with cattle with your brand.</i>

209
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,602
<i>A brand is permanent, it means
you're part of something much bigger.</i>

210
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,273
<i>You belong and belonging is forever.</i>

211
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,700
Coyotes! There's coyotes out there!

212
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,496
I heard it too.

213
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,250
Shhh, look.

214
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,878
Jack, let's get them in the corral.

215
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,839
Open the gate.

216
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,051
- Shh...
- Where'd they come from?

217
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,471
- Montford!
- Look at all this. Shh...

218
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,310

00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,494
They must've

222
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,163
That's Joe Carlton's brand.

223
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,874
This one here's Alec Cochran's.

224
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,252
That one right there, that's a maverick.

225
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,798
No brand so he's yours.

226
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,760
Mister, you just doubled
your stock overnight.

227
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,387
We gotta bring 'em back to
Joe and Alec in the morning.

228
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,347
Probably wrote 'em off as lost for good.

229
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,226
Yeah, but I bet there's more up there.

230
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,938
Four years is a long time
for cattle in the wild.

231
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,275
Yeah, I mean if they survived
the wolves and panthers and such,

232
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,319
there's gotta be more.

233
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:55,657
Do you see Joe or Alec, given their age
and health, lightin' up there after 'em?

234
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,828
No, hill country's too dangerous.

235
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:06,668
And full of cattle that have been
breading for years. Unbranded!

236
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,636
<i>Well, what do you think Mr. Carlton?</i>

237
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,139
You want me to agree to let you buy

238
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,267
any of my cattle you can round up.

239
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,730
Cattle I'd already given up on as lost?

240
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,441
- Yes, sir.
- And I don't do nothing?

241
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,611
You pay me my share when you
sell 'em to the next fella?

242
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,947
That's correct.

243
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,325
Go on! Go on up there and get 'em all!

244
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,703

I'm not fixin' to be brush poppin'
no beeves one after the other,

258
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,889
that's just plain crazy.

259
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,807
Gotta figure out how to get 'em to us.

260
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Trap 'em.

261
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:53,025
Just like the devil traps
men with beautiful women.

262
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:57,279
Yup.

263
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,996
That's it right there. I got it.

264
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,336
Salt. We'll trap 'em with salt.

265
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,504
They'll do anything for a taste.

266
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,011
We got it!

267
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,599

God-fearing Christians
just passing through.

273
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,879
Can we approach?

274
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,216
C'mon in.

275
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,927
Thank you, sir.

276
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,020
Evenin'.

277
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,941
We're just wandering,

278
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,487
me and my men, cold and hungry.

279
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,032
Find some solace at your fire?

280
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,454
Something smells good there.

281
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,916
Oh, you smell that boys? Ah?

282
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,211
I do my best.

283
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,045
So, uh...

284
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,925
what's, uh...

285
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,636
a boy like yourself...

286
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,390
doin' out here in the night?

287
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,060
Just looking for lost cows.

288
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,604
Mooooo.

289
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,237
Thank you.

290
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,823
What brings you gentleman
out to this part of the country?

291
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:09,703
We just rode up from Texas. We're hunters.

292
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,290
Thought we'd try and come scout some game.

293
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,337
What type of game you fancy?

294
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,799
Human kind.

295
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:32,726
You see, uh, these Mexican regulates,

296
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,812
they give us 150 pesos.

297
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,107
Comanche, Apache scalps.

298
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:44,821
We see, uh... any ol' red skin
scalp will do.

299
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,741
'Cause, uh,

300
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,579
a savage is a savage...

301
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,166
is a savage.

302
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,566
You all right, boy?

303
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:27,697
This scalp here,
that wouldn't make me a wooden penny.

304
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,076
Wrong texture, you see.

305
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,329
But I do have a few questions.

306
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:40,919
Have you seen any redskins around here?

307
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:46,424
No, sir. No Indians around
here that I know of.

308
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,135
You lying to me, boy?

309
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:53,557
I did see some soldiers, though.
No Indians.

310
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,308
Evenin'

311
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,355
Whoa! Easy there, Cochise!
We're all friends here!

312
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,357
You Texans have overstayed your welcome.

313
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,070
They always do.

314
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,828
Hey. Come on. You gonna leave us out here
with absolutely nothing?

315
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,998
- There's dangerous things out here.
- Keep the knife.

316
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:23,086
No knife, you get to keep your life.

317
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,754
Seems like a fair deal. Huh?

318
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,341
Don't get your britches
in a bunch there, chief.

319
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,180
You boys...

320
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,267
You boys are gonna regret this.

321
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,062
Threaten me again, I'll kill you.

322
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,275
Best believe when I say
I'm gonna do something, I do it.

323
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,116
I believe you would.

324
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,211
I'm gonna walk out of here, OK?

325
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,546
You better, cowboy.

326
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,269
Here, boy.

327
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,233
Let's move. No more fires.

328
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,985
We sleep in shifts.

329
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,659
Amen. I hear you, brother.

330
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,222
Looking good.

331
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:06,606
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Yes, sir. What comes in, can't come out.

332
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,068
Spread that salt around here.

333
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,210
Look! It's Papa!

334
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,798
Papa! Papa! Over here, over here!

335
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,759
Papa! He's home!

336
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,972
Edward Bryant, Mary Elizabeth.

337
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,390
Hey, welcome back!

338
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,019
Ah, y'all are a sight for sore eyes.

339
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,062
Oh, son!

340
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,320
Y'all find any cattle?

341
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,697
Oh, yeah! We found a bunch!

342
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,741
They're up there roaming,
more'n we can count!

343
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,993
- Oh, yes, ma'am!
- Well, where are they?

344
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,288
Oh, we just have to be a little
better prepared next time, that's all!

345
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,371
I was afraid that...

346
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,374
Oh, we're going back out there for sure.

347
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,500
- Oh!
- Yeah.

348
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,087
Gonna keep 'em in
that pasture right over there.

349
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,717
Gonna build a cattle tank,

350
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,011
fence off the draw.

351
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,847
Edward Bryant and I can handle that.

352
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,642
All right, yeah. Gonna bring back a bunch.

353
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,853
Yes, ma'am.

354
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,775
Seems like you both need
something to eat. Jack, please join us.

355
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,777
Oh, that'd be just fine. Thank you, ma'am.

356
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,908
Come on, come on, come on!

357
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,170
Aha! Look at that!

358
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,423
Told you, didn't I?

359
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,054
- Yes, you did!
- Now let's get these mavericks back home!

360
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,941
Sergeant, here they come!

361
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,277
There they are!

362
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,453
Go get 'em, trooper.
Go ahead and shoot 'em savage!

363
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,538
Hey, circle around!

364
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,958
Fire that gun and we'll
string you up on the spot!

365
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,255
- Those mavericks are mine!
- They branded?

366
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,563
'Cause if they ain't I got a real rancher

367
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,970
that says red devils rustled up 15 of his.
They look familiar?

368
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,182
- Yeah, they're mine.
- You lie!

369
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,898
You think anyone's gonna
care about a dead Injun?

370
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,985
Think about your wife and that little boy.

371
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,362
These belong to me!

372
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,865
Well, sir, I got a white man
who says they're his.

373
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,759
Who do you think the law's gonna believe?

374
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,868
This ain't right!

375
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,419
I consider all these wild cattle out here
property of U.S. Government.

376
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,670
I consider you wrong!

377
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,299
You wanna make some real money,
Montford Thomas Johnson?

378
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,677
Army's putting a premium on buffalo hides.

379
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:26,431
You realize you're taking everything
these people have? Huh?

380
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,351
Thinkin' is, no buffalo to hunt,
they gotta change their ways.

381
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,271
- Stay on the reservation.
- Yeah and what good is that?

382
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,232
Control and progress. Don't you get it?

383
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,569
It's why we always win
and Injuns always lose.

384
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,449
Always a pleasure, Monty.

385
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:47,993
Move out.

386
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,504
Next maverick we lay eyes on,

387
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,797
we brand it.

00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,321
Now we're square?

405
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,324

- Hey.
- Hey, sis.

416
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,793
Look at all this.
Mother would have been proud.

417
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,298
Father would be proud, too.

418
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,091
"Father."

419
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,556
Do you remember his face?

420
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,934
I do.

421
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,440
Thing is, I don't.

422
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,614
When the memories piece him together
for me, it just turns into a shadow.

423
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,622
- I've forgiven him.
- Not me.

424
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,126
Forgotten, not forgiven.

425
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,492
There's enough meat out there
to feed the tribes for months.

426
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,939
- You sure you're not hungry?
- No.

427
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,160
You can't imagine the stench.

428
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,495
Death.

429
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,337
Can't get it out of your mind.

430
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,094
Come up on some Kiowa looking hopeless...

431
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,432
What are they gonna eat?

432
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,023
Maybe God blessed us
so we could bless others.

433
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,510
Figure you'd pass
some of these on to the...

434
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,512
tribes hurt by the buffalo slaughter?

435
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,681
Sure. I'm sure they could use 'em.

436
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:10,108
Hey, isn't that Rising Wolf?

437
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,492
C'mon.

438
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,250
Whoa.

439
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,880
What happened?

440
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,884
We were...

441
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,721
We were camped near Lodge Pole River.

442
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,685
Soldiers appeared with the sun rise
and started shooting.

443
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,853
Which soldiers?

444
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,106
Long hair and his men.

445
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,986
They came from the north, Fort Supply.

446
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,404
Custer.

447
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,868
- Was there a battle?
- All of the men were out hunting.

448
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,204
We heard the gunshots and the screams.

449
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,876
It wasn't a battle, it was a massacre.

450
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,795
So sorry.

451
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,965
Black Kettle
had returned the night before.

452
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,929
He tried to make peace but the soldiers,

453
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,016
they kill him and his wife.

454
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:33,191
Shot all the horses before they
slaughtered the women and the children.

455
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,361
We got out who we could.

456
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,906
What can I do for you, brother?

457
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,036
We were on our way to
go to Jesse's, to trade.

458
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,916
I just left Jesse with a bunch of cattle.
Take whatever you need.

459
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,460
- You're welcome to stay at the homestead.
- Thank you.

460
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,504
We'll take the cattle...

461
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,050
but we have our own path to follow.

462
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,428
Ours will cross again.

463
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,583
Here! He's at the corral!

464
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,461
Let's go, c'mon. Over there!

465
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,515
Look out!
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

466
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,448
- Load it, come on.
- Come on.

467
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,954
Come on, hurry up.

468
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,301
Hyah, hyah, let's go!

469
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,181
Get out!

470
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,814
- Mommy!
- Go back to bed, E.B.!

471
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,404
Gotta push 'em back.

472
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,705
Move back, move back!

473
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,417
Let's go! Move!

474
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,766
Mary! Mary!

475
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,395
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Montford! The horses!

476
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,356
Don't worry about them! Give it to me!

477
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,822
Montford, you're shot.
Let's get that tended to inside.

478
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,952
- C'mon!
- Can we track 'em?

479
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,414
We'll track 'em in the morning.

480
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,711
Y'all go inside. I'll keep watch...

481
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,589
in case they come back.

482
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,805
In case they come back.

483
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,729
Ain't gonna get
nothin' for them horses.

484
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,247
There's that weasel right there!

485
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,915
Why the long faces boys?

486
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,918
- You believe this fella?
- He got some nerve.

487
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,128
Where's all the cattle?

488
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,799
Cattle? Oh. Must've slipped your mind

489
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,844
to tell us about the redskin

490
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,515
and the Black fella, who shot me.

491
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:48,112
Look at this fine head of hair
we have here boys.

492
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,322
This uniform says you'll hang!

493
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,615
What're you waitin' for?

494
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,409
That's right, Holden,
give him a shave.

495
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,411
You trying to scare me? Huh?

496
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,709
C'mon now...

497
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:06,547
Almost had me killed
and all my men killed.

498
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,674
For what?

499
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,304
This string of rancid horse meat?

500
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,306
We'll get the whole herd next time.

501
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,269
Hey, I do know
the whereabouts of plenty of Injuns.

502
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,272
A whole wagon load of scalps.

503
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,322
Sit.

504
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,040
Well, looks like they split up here.

505
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,876
Divided my horses.

506
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,469
One group went down yonder.

507
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,224
The other one went...

508
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,519
Well, well, well...

509
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,231
What is it?

510
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,068
Ammo pouch.

511
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,074
Indians use those?

512
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:18,244
No. No, they don't.

513
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,548
State ya business, Johnson.

514
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,133
Our business is with Lieutenant Pratt.

515
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,095
I said state your business or ride on!

516
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,862
As soon as I speak
with Lieutenant Pratt!

517
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,559
Mr. Johnson, how can I help you?

518
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,438
Lieutenant, you told me to come
see you if I ever had a problem.

519
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,523
My office.

520
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,782
Double time, thank you.

521
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,827
What is it?

522
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:07,501
We's found it at the rustlers' camp.
Sure it belongs to someone round here.

523
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,963
- Thievin' Indians always stealing from us.
- Thievin', huh?

524
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,634
Ya know, the past two years white men been
rustling stock all over the territory.

525
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,845
Talkin' about "Indians done it."

526
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,848
You create enough bad blood between
farmers, ranchers, and Indians,

527
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,601
- we end up forced on a reservation.
- If that is the case,

528
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,978
I certainly don't approve of the means,

529
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,857
but you must admit the ends do render
a safer United States.

530
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,567
Now the Indian must

531
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,321
fall in line with American society
or he will become extinct.

532
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,906
I've seen how the Army tries to civilize

533
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,718
by slaughtering innocent
men, women, and children

534
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,910
- and calling it progress.
- This is a war, Montford!

535
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,287
Our orders are total war

536
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,248
and the casualties will continue
to mount so long as the savages...

537
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,125
- You're the savage!
- Sergeant.

538
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:56,216
Mr. Johnson, I do believe if we
kill the savage, we save the man.

539
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,470
Sir, seventh cavalry has arrived.

540
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,725
Good luck tracking your rustlers.

541
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,185
I thought that was your job.

542
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,854
Let's get outta here, Jack.

543
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,483
Better be careful, Colonel!

544
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,342
Some day you might run into
some Indians that are ready for ya.

545
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,117
Easy, Montford. Easy.

546
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,829
Colonel Custer. Welcome to Fort Sill.

547
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,922
Those rustlers, they was
looking to take more than my cattle.

548
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,759
Home don't feel safe no more.

549
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,805
How many head we got?

550
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,518
Fifteen hundred beeves give or take.
Why you ask?

551
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,437
Drive 'em straight to market,
Abilene, Kansas.

552
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,732
Use the money to build
a new ranch out west.

553
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,903
Whoa... That's a big drive with 1500 head.

554
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:04,743
We'd have to go through Cheyenne,
Comanche, and Kiowa territory.

555
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,205
Yeah, just gotta ask
permission from the tribes.

556
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,834
{\an8}Montford Johnson,
you are an honorable man.

557
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:15,504
{\an8}Here assembled are
the great chiefs of many nations.

558
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,967
You can lead your cattle
through our lands.

559
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:25,514
In return, our people can have
some of your cattle

560
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,599
if they are in need.

561
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,394
There will be no hostility between us,

562
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,938
no blood to stain the grass.

563
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:37,067
We want it kept clean and pure.

564
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,777
Agreed.

565
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,112
Good.

566
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:15,314
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

567
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,193
- Can I help you?
- Why, yes, sir, you can!

568
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,445
Hey, cousin Montford!

569
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,114
Do I know you?

570
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,741
We're cousins.

571
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,912
My grandfather was the brother
to your grandma, I'm Chub Moore.

572
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,623
I don't ever remember
my grandma telling me about

573
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,708
a cousin with the unusual name of Chub.

574
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,253
Well, sir, here I am.
I been living over near Blue Creek.

575
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,339
I heard things been
going real well for you.

576
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,299
That's your given name? Chub?

577
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,844
No, sir. Clarence.
Folks started calling me Chub

578
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,846
because I like to eat and,

579
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,934
well, sir, I tend to get big and 'round
around the middle. Ma'am!

580
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,019
What can I do for you, Clarence?

581
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,063
Well, times been tough, lately,

582
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,066
especially for some of the hard working
families around here.

583
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,236
A lot of the little ones
in these parts have lost their folks.

584
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,948
I think they'd be a great help
to you, Mr. Johnson.

585
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,866
Could you find it in your heart

586
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,910
and let 'em roost
at your place for a while?

587
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,748
They'd be welcome, Chub.

588
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:15,831
Thank you, ma'am!

589
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,585
Mr. and Mr. Johnson,

590
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,212
this is Frank Dwyer,

591
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,301
Josephine Harris, and Lon Gray.

592
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,346
I'm Mrs. Johnson, welcome to our home!

593
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,431
We've got Lucinda Gray,

594
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,229
Sally Thompson, Henry McLish

595
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,730
and we've got one more,

596
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,819
this is Alexander. But we call him Muggs.

597
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,366
Well, welcome, all of you.

598
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,119
Now, c'mon inside,
we'll get cleaned up for supper.

599
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,452
Come.

600
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,923
I think we're gonna need a bigger house.
Go on inside.

601
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,532
I'm gonna need something from you,
Clarence.

602
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,183
- Anything!
- How much you know about cattle?

603
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,312
About as much as that fence post.

604
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:23,483
Well, we're getting ready to have
a cattle drive, so what do you know?

605
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,361
Food! I now good eats, sir,

606
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:31,742
and I sure can cook like the dickens.
Nobody can fry a chicken like me.

607
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,537
Ha, I believe you. I guess we got
ourselves a cookie then.

608
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,497
Welcome home, cousin Clarence.

609
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,166
Call me Chub, Mr. Montford!

610
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,711
<i>Every single child in the Johnson family</i>

611
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,713
<i>must have their own cow with a brand.</i>

612
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,424
<i>The brand never leaves.</i>

613
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,724
<i>It means that you are part
of something bigger.</i>

614
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:56,099
<i>You belong. And belonging is forever.
Ain't that right, Muggs?</i>

615
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,736
What's the final head count?

616
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,824
Still at 1500. Got them all at the spring
at the north-west draw.

617
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,087
That's most of our cattle,
there's no guarantee.

618
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:30,884
Well, we've been down
to one skinny little cow before.

619
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,844
I'm not worried.

00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,709
- Why is he always singing to the cows?
- Oh, it keeps 'em calm!

636
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,714
I've seen a heard spook and stampede
over nothing louder than a dropped spoon.

637
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,299
Ya don't say.

638
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,676
Oh, dang!

639
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,052

00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,015
You don't ever wanna see a herd stampede!

641
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,642
Let's go! Push 'em to the north.

642
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,192
So where are these savages driving them?

643
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,693
Probably Abilene.

644
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,406
<i>- And how many head?

645

00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:23,288
Well, I can't join you
so I'll just take a tenth.

647

The rest is yours.

648
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,085
Aye, done.

649
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:33,131
One other request, that half-breed Indian,
I want him dead.

Everyone, listen up!

671
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,945
There's some rustlers out there

672
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,323
who want to take our cattle.

673
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,910
They ain't gonna leave any of us alive.

674
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,496
- We can't let that happen!
- OK, uh-huh.

675
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,373
You know who we are!

676
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,626
- We're warriors!
- Right. Yeah.

677
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,796
We been fighting all our lives.
It ain't nothing new.

678
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:18,964
Uh-huh. That's right.

679
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:22,842
All right then. We'll take watch
in shifts tonight, guns loaded.

680
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,594
I'll take the first one.

681
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,139
Set the tongue to the north star, boys.

682
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,934
- We leave at day break.
- Yes, sir!

683
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,602
Beautiful morning!

684
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,068
Cross river here
and we'll push north-east

685
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,444
Mm-hmm. Yes, sir!

686
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,709
Oh, all right! What have we got, Clarence?

687
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,377
Biscuit and beans!

688
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,423
- Montford.
- Yes, sir?

689
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,008
There's something you should see.

690
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,200
How far are we from Abilene?

691
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,078
About 30 miles passing.

692
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,913
I'm sorry, Montford,

693
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,624
but they knew we'd have to pass

694
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,002
and they waiting for us

695
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,423
<i>with more men and more guns.</i>

696
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,940
Did you tell 'em?

697
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,737
They gonna be with ya
no matter what you decide.

698
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,454
Ya know, a lot of 'em got
a wives and kids at home.

699
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,669
Is there any way...

700
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,756
we can get around that bunch?

701
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:31,721
Montford, we'd have to double back,
head south.

702
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,891
Hit the river at its highest point.

703
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,436
It'd add another week.

704
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,814
Besides,

705
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,528
they just keep on after us.

706
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,240
Keep hitting us 'til we break,

707
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,494
but it's your call, boss.

708
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,561
What they singing?

709
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,189
War song.

710
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,871
We gonna go straight through 'em.

711
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,291
OK then.

712
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,442
Hyah! Hyah!

713
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,622
That's the place, don't let 'em stray!

714
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,756
- Get up!
- Yeah, yeah, get up.

715
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,591
- Get up!
- What's happening?

716
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,677
- Wake up! Stampede!
- Wake up!

717
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,762
Stampede!

718
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,017
Run! It's a stampede!

719
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,896
Stampede!

720
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,651
No! Run!

721
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:55,615
It's a stampede!

722
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,412
Get to the woods!

723
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,840
Yeah!

724
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,262
That's him right there!

725
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:23,476
Let's bury 'em. Him first.

726
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,274
He that seeketh mischief,
it shall come onto him.

727
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:30,900
Amen!

728
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,505
That's a fine lookin' herd.

729
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:03,850
Now you remember, don't take
nothing less than $30 a head.

730
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,571
So how'd we do?

731
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,283
Fifty-five a head!

732
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,829
Boy, we's in high cotton now!

733
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,753
Papa! Look, Papa's home!

734
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,214
Edward Bryant, this is for you.

735
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,259
And this is for you, Frank.

736
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,719
Here you go.

737
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,723
This is for you, Sally.

738
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,558
You're very welcome.

739
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,809
What'd you get?

740
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,484
I got something special for you.

741
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,444
Is that so?

742
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:03,910
You think we're made of money?

743
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,915
How much? $30 a head?

744
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,754
I told you, didn't I? I told you!

745
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,383
I think it's about time
we built that house.

746
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,593
I'd like that very much.

747
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,032
Edward Bryant.

748
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,537
- You pitch the hay in that lot?
- Yes, sir!

749
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,706
- Check on those heifers?
- Yes, sir!

750
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,420
Who is that?

751
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,132
It's Rising Wolf's wife.

752
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,303
Asha, is everything alright?

753
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,765
- They took Rising Wolf and all the men.
- Who?

754
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,226
- The soldiers!
- Let's go!

755
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,356
Corporal, bring 'em in!

756
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,403
- S'cuse me?
- Yes?

757
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,006
- I need to speak with Lieutenant Pratt.
- Ah, Lieutenant Pratt's gone.

758
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:23,948
Where?

759
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,409
Him and Sergeant Richter
caught some Cheyenne criminals.

760
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,172
Taking 'em down to Fort Marion in Florida.

761
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,621
- Why?
- Too dangerous to keep here.

762
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,582
Too dangerous for who? The Cheyenne?

763
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:33,665
Good day, sir.

764
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,420
I gotta go get 'em.

765
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:44,469
Well, who's gonna take care
of the ranch while you're gone?

766
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:47,680
- Jack will stay here and help out.
- I don't like that you're taking E.B.

767
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,308
Not at all.
Florida is a long way from here

768
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,809
Well he's not a baby anymore.

769
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,186
I want him to know the world.

770
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,896
Learn to be a man.

771
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,106
He's gonna learn at my side,
not on his own.

772
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,358
Well, I guess I can't change your mind.

773
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:20,504
Can I help you?

774
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,049
Montford Johnson?

775
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,800
That's me.

776
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,934
Montford, uh,

777
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,436
I'm your father.

778
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:42,859
No.

779
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:45,947
Not you.

780
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,509
The swamps of Arkansas
swallowed up all of our wagons.

781
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,970
It was utterly impossible to get through.

782
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:11,013
- So what'd ya do?
- Well...

783
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,101
Charles,

784
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,731
so nice of you to join us.

785
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,025
Sorry, Boggy took your seat.

786
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,404
- Oh, forgive me, boy, I...
- Oh, hush, you're our guest tonight.

787
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,738
Sit down.

788
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,564
- Grandpa was just telling us about how...
- That's enough.

789
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,788
He's not your grandfather.

790
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:39,584
Montford, stop.

791
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,379
- Let the man talk.
- He ain't no man.

792
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,342
To be Chickasaw is to be family.

793
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:51,554
And he's neither.

794
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,389
Ain't no father.

795
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,727
A real father never leaves.

796
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,237
Can you pass me those potatoes?

797
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,745
So, Edward Bryant,

798
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,625
what was Mr. Johnson saying?

799
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,544
Uh, well, he uh...

800
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:30,051
Uh, Mr. Johnson was recollecting on how
he got his name during Removal times.

801
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,134
Mmm.

802
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,555
Sounds like a great story.

803
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:37,892
I'm sure he's full of 'em.

804
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,186
Well, Mr. Johnson,

805
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,230
tell us a story.

806
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,944
I implemented an old English trick

807
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,488
with Granny Vicey and Rebekah,

808
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:56,327
your mother, and I cut saplings
and laid them on the mud,

809
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,454
one on top another until...

810
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,750
until it was capable of holding
the combined weight

811
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,794
of our wagons and horses.

812
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,586
Uh-huh.

813
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:10,049
By that way we built a road
straight through the swamp,

814
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,762
uh, some prefer to call it a bog.

815
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:18,140
Charles became Boggy
because I led the people through the bog.

816
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,476
That's a real nice story.

817
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,103
Montford...

818
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:27,692
Maybe you could share with us a story
about where you been the last 30 years.

819
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,528
- Montford.
- I'm sure

820
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,279
everybody would love to hear that one.

821
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,413
You make me sick. I lost my appetite.

822
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,769
I know you're awake.

823
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,523
I don't like the children
seeing you like that.

824
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,109
N You need to speak to that man
and forgive him.

825
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,112
Why should I? He just comes back
and expects a big hug?

826
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,532
You know, I did everything right!

827
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,953
Provided, protected, fed, clothed,
put my life on the line.

828
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:25,041
Everything to make sure our family
was safe and could thrive.

829
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,670
Never once complained,
never shirked my duty.

830
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:33,674
Forgive him?

831
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,013
No, you're not like him, Montford.

832
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:40,890
That's true.

833
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,685
You did everything you could
to not become like your father.

834
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,147
But with all that you've done for us,

835
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,233
did you do it because you really loved us

836
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,197
or because you were scared
of becoming like him?

837
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,737
Hm?

838
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,784
Did you act out of love or out of fear

839
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,703
because that display at dinner
felt like a scared man to me.

840
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,333
I just don't know why he left.

841
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,504
I don't know why he left
and it bothers me.

842
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,069
And why does he pick now to come back?

843
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:19,762
Now that we're doing well?

844
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,182
Five'll get you ten, he wants money.

845
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,769
Well, just ask him, Montford.

846
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,022
I'm sure he's got an answer.

847
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,250
Took your time coming home.

848
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,171
Grass wasn't so green out there, huh?

849
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:57,049
Certainly was not.

850
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,388
Could you forgive me, Vicey?

851
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,474
I done did long ago.

852
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,770
It's him you have to plead your case to.

853
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:14,108
And because of you,
he is not a forgiving man.

854
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,450
You built quite the ranch here, Montford.

855
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:27,746
- It's very impressive. I'm proud of you.
- What do you want?

856
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,041
No, you know what, just tell me this.

857
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,753
What was so bad about us
that you needed to leave?

858
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,465
- Well, I, I...
- You know I waited every day for you.

859
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:39,884
Every night.

860
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,971
Counted on your word.

861
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,265
You said you'd come back.

862
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,060
And I believed you.

863
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:53,063
I walked the trail with your mother,
I know the Chickasaw way.

864
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,524
I knew family was everything, she knew it.

865
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,319
I just wished I could've lived it, I uh...

866
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,699
I well knew that every day
I lost was time irretrievable.

867
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:08,245
And I was afraid to return.

868
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:11,874
Well, all any boy wants
is a father to look up to.

869
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:14,417
Trust.

870
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,754
Know that he's gonna be there
when you fall.

871
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:20,883
- Well, you're the best example of that...
- And you're the worst example of that.

872
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:23,719
You know I needed you.
Adelaide needed you.

873
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:25,304
And where were you?

874
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,307
You promised you'd come back!

875
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,226
Yeah, I deserve that.

876
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,982
I know I can't bring back
the years and...

877
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:41,904
Son, I can't ask you to accept me

878
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:46,367
but I hope there's a place
in your heart for a weak man

879
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,744
who simply wishes your forgiveness.

880
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,289
That's all you came back for?

881
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:54,833
- Forgiveness?
- Montford.

882
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:58,879
- You sure it wasn't something else?
- Nothing else!

883
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,136
I'm not calling you father.

884
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,022
Mary said you were planning a trip.

885
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,738
A group of Cheyenne men
were taken from their families.

886
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:31,578
Held up in some old fort in St. Augustine.
I'm gonna go get 'em, bring 'em home.

887
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:35,791
I know that fort.
Spanish built, Fort Marion.

888
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,919
It's quite formidable.

889
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:44,174
The English Army
couldn't take it in 1702 or 1740.

890
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,843
What makes you think you can?

891
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:47,303
I don't know, Mr. Johnson.

892
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,140
I'll figure something out.

893
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,809
I gave my word
and unlike you I aim to keep it.

894
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,354
I have friends in Washington.

895
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,233
There's a Senator
who owes me quite a lot, actually.

896
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,652
A U.S. Senator?

897
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,447
That might be useful.

898
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:09,825
We leave tomorrow.

899
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:15,164
<i>Haply I think on thee...
And then my state,</i>

900
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:17,833
<i>Like to the lark
at break of day arising.</i>

901
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:22,087
<i>From sullen earth sings hymns
at heaven's gate.</i>

902
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,966
<i>For thy sweet love
remembered such wealth brings,</i>

903
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:30,512
That then I scorn to
change my state with kings.

904
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,014
It's gonna be a long ride.

905
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,808
My letter to the senator
should arrive today.

906
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,687
After all, he does owe me quite a lot,
of course.

907
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:43,692
You keep saying that
like you wish it was true. But is it?

908
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,029
Next stop, Blue Springs!

909
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,499
Whoa, now!

910
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:03,504
Could I interest this studious young man
in a sugar ice on a warm, humid night?

911
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:05,464
No, thank you, sir,

912
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,257
Whereabouts might Fort Marion be?

913
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,134
You referring to the local zoo?

914
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:11,821
That's what we call it, the zoo.

915
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:14,515
'Course instead of wild animals
we got wild Indians

916
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:15,599
and I mean to tell you

917
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,769
they are scarier than
the meanest zoo animal.

918
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:21,563
Human animal is the most dangerous kind.

919
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,525
Hey! We got friends in there
and they ain't no animals.

920
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,011
They didn't even do nothing wrong.

921
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:31,073
From one cultivated man to another,
I highly doubt that.

922
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:37,079
Ya know the ol' Fort, up yonder,
just past the school house.

923
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:40,290
It's the oldest building in this,
uh, very old town.

924
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:45,879
Now, please, enjoy your stay... gentlemen.

925
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,188
You're keeping these men here illegally.

926
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,374
They didn't do nothing wrong.

927
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:08,277
Not at all, Mr. Johnson, they will get
a trial, of that I assure you.

928
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:14,241
In the meantime, it is my endeavor to
assimilate them into American culture.

929
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:18,745
That way, if they are eventually released,
they can contribute to society.

930
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:19,829
If?

931
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,291
Lieutenant Pratt,
I appreciate your sentiment

932
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:24,334
but the rule of law
for any man in this country

933
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,670
dictates a fair and speedy trial.

934
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:29,131
I've noticed these men
haven't been given any trial at all,

935
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:30,549
not even a hearing.

936
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,134
You a lawyer, sir?

937
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,802
My name's Johnson.

938
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,722
I'm friends with Senator
Augustus Hill Garland of Arkansas

939
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,099
and President Rutherford B. Hayes.

940
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,810
I'm quite certain the Senator has been
in communication with you?

941
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,604
No, sir, he has not.

942
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,148
No correspondence of any kind?

943
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:50,110
Look, Mr. Johnson,
I can guarantee you and your friends

944
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:54,364
that the 70 men in custody here are being
treated with fairness and compassion.

945
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,448
Compassion?

946
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,177
Tell me, how compassionate
is it to keep them here

947
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,453
when their wives and children
are a thousand miles away?

948
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,750
We're teaching them. English,
skills, arithmetic, manners

949
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,294
so that they can get
the most of a cultivated life.

950
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:09,379
Mr. Johnson, I'm at a loss.

951
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,090
There are no Chickasaws here,
why do you make this your concern?

952
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:15,957
'Cause I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.

953
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,764
And what you're doing here,
it ain't right, no. sir.

954
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:21,075
They ought to be at home
providing for their families.

955
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,267
That's where they belong.

956
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:27,022
Not locked up in some filthy,
god-forsaken dungeon.

957
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,129
If you had any real compassion,
I think you'd understand that.

958
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:33,278
I do, understand that.

959
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,865
I'm sorry. You men have traveled in vain.

960
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:41,620
There is nothing any one of us can do
to change this situation. Goodnight.

961
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:59,888
Montford! Montford Johnson! Montford!

962
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:02,307
Montford!

963
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:26,456
You know all these men?

964
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,710
Longer'n I known you.

965
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,255
Keep it down!

966
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,133
I said keep it down!

967
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,305
Evenin', gentlemen.

968
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,602
I take it this old man here to be
from the better side of your lineage?

969
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,108
Three generations of fools!

970
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,459
We need more water!

971
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:18,050
Boggy! Papa! I smell smoke!

972
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,843
The hospital goes,
the whole town goes.

973
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,470
Is that the hospital?

974
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:22,888
More people in there?

975
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,435
Get those two barrels up here!

976
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,648
Cut it with a rag!

977
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,651
- I'm gonna go round back.
- More water! Come on!

978
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,071
- Where are they?
- Over here!

979
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,034
- Get a move on!
- Get there.

980
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:45,118
Come on! Help!

981
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,912
We need more men! Come around here!

982
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,580
Come on, come on, come on!

983
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:51,375
- We need more men.
- I need your help!

984
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,460
You got 70 good men right over there.

985
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,170
There's more people inside.

986
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:57,756
Help! There's fire everywhere!

987
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,174
Sergeant, release the prisoners.

988
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,678
Sir, all due respect,
they are not to be trusted.

989
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,096
Sergeant, that is an order!

990
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,140
C'mon, you heard him.

991
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,225
Come on!

992
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:11,228
Come around the side,
I need you! Montford, come with me!

993
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:12,896
- I'm going in.
- I'm coming too!

994
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:14,356
- Nope, no.
- Yes, c'mon!

995
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:15,524
Stay here! You stay here!

996
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,150
E.B., stay here. Help with the trough!

997
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,834
- Stay here.
- C'mon, let's go, let's go.

998
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,069
Come on.

999
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,571
There's people in the back

1000
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,073
In the back. Let's go in.

1001
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,325
I'll be back, son! Stay safe!

1002
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,370
Stay low, follow me.

1003
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,251
In here, in here! Here they are.

1004
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,503
Careful, I gotcha.

1005
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:37,754
Come on.

1006
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,383
Get a bucket, get a bucket, get a bucket!
Go around back and fight it around back!

1007
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,636
Here's another one!

1008
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,804
Go around, go around.

1009
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,724
Y'all get them buckets back here!

1010
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,224
Bring those buckets back.

1011
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,476
- Are there more inside?
- Yes!

1012
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,403
Stay low.

1013
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:02,779
Just up here!

1014
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:08,701
Over here!

1015
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,373
There's more of us up here.
Please help.

1016
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:14,708
Over here!

1017
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:18,295
- Help please! Please!
- Come on.

1018
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,255
Let's go.

1019
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:21,840
I gotcha, let's go.

1020
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:23,043
- I'll keep looking!
- C'mon.

1021
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,635
- I heard someone! Did you?
- Where?

1022
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,012
This way!

1023
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:29,890
Come on.

1024
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:31,475
- I got her!
- Check that way!

1025
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:32,558
All right.

1026
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,478
Over here.

1027
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,188
Over there!

1028
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,778
Hey!

1029
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:46,490
- Sir?
- Hey!

1030
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,950
Nothing in here, mate.
She's gonna blow!

1031
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:50,702
Hey!

1032
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:58,877
This the last of 'em?

1033
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:04,089
Montford?

1034
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:05,841
Montford?

1035
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,094
Where's Montford?

1036
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:09,906
- I don't know, I didn't see him.
- He was with you.

1037
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,908
- I didn't see anybody else in there.
- Where's Papa?

1038
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,201
- Where's Montford?
- Where is he?

1039
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,935
Like I said I didn't see him!

1040
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,229
C'mon, C'mon.
Stay here, E.B., go around back!

1041
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:18,764
Clear Sergeant? We all clear?

1042
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:22,175
As far as I know, sir. I'm gonna head back
to the fort to get some medical supplies.

1043
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:29,740
Help!

1044
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:32,452
Montford!

1045
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:34,329
Help!

1046
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:35,412
Montford!

1047
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,417
Anybody help!

1048
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:43,505
- Help!
- I can't find you! Montford!

1049
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:44,588
Help!

1050
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:46,925
Help!

1051
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,762
Montford!

1052
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:57,644
Montford!

1053
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,106
Montford!

1054
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,899
Papa!

1055
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,610
I'm coming for you, Montford!

1056
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,280
I'm coming for you, son!

1057
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,826
I got you, son! I got you!

1058
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,660
Safe now.

1059
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,709
Help! Come get him!

1060
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:28,133
Help'll come by soon enough.

1061
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:31,052
- Where's my father?
- He's over here, c'mon.

1062
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:38,351
- Papa! Is he OK? Papa!
- Yeah, I got him. I got him.

1063
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,560
Son!

1064
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,733
I thought I lost you.

1065
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:47,986
I'm OK. Your grandfather found me.

1066
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,490
- What were you doing in that room?
- Richter trapped me.

1067
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,994
Richter!

1068
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,059
Something I can help you with,
Mr. Johnson?

1069
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,252
- Shut up!
- Hey! Hey!

1070
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,545
Arrest this man!

1071
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:08,381
Whoa! OK, what's going on here?

1072
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,908
- This monster was trying to kill my son!
- He's delusional!

1073
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,011
- What is going on?
- He trapped him purposely!

1074
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,680
Actually, sir,
I'd like to report something.

1075
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:17,641
Whatever he says is a lie!

1076
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:19,493
In the hospital,
I saw him, he jammed the door shut.

1077
01:22:19,517 --> 01:22:21,871
I'm a sergeant! You're gonna take
a private's word over mine?

1078
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:25,941
Sergeant, at ease!
Both of you come with me right now!

1079
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,028
That man tried to kill my son!

1080
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:37,994
Lies! All Lies!

1081
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,915
You gonna believe
an Injun's word over mine?

1082
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:44,042
Quiet down! You're going away for life!

1083
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:45,876
How you feeling, Papa?

1084
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,089
Like I swallowed charcoal.

1085
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:55,679
Thank you for coming, brother.

1086
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:58,640
Even if we can't be free,

1087
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:00,403
your presence has brings us
great strength.

1088
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,625
We'd like to thank you all.

1089
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:30,463
I'd like to thank you and
these other men for helping to...

1090
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:33,049
save our town.

1091
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:35,051
We're sorry.

1092
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:39,639
We...
We coulda been better than we have been.

1093
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:28,104
- Charles Johnson.
- Senator Garland.

1094
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:31,775
- What an extreme pleasure to see you, sir.
- Thank you.

1095
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:34,378
Thank you so much for coming!
I take it you received my letters?

1096
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:38,281
I did indeed and
it deserved a personal visit

1097
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:40,325
rather than written correspondence.

1098
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,660
'Cause as you know, I, uh...

1099
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,454
well I owe you quite a bit.

1100
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:46,831
Uh, yeah, that's what I've been saying.

1101
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,851
Oh, I'd like you to meet,
uh, well, this is...

1102
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:51,669
I'm Montford Johnson. I'm his son.

1103
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:57,383
Very pleased to meet you, Montford.
Very pleased. And this is?

1104
01:24:57,717 --> 01:25:00,512
Edward Bryant. I'm his grandson.

1105
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:01,930
Really?

1106
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:03,932
Lieutenant Pratt.

1107
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:06,559
- Yes, sir. Friend of the Johnsons?
- I am!

1108
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,938
Well, I'm not sure
there's much, as I've said,

1109
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:13,566
that can be done under your authority.
I'm following Army orders.

1110
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:17,737
It's not my own authority I come with,
but that of the United States government.

1111
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:19,280
And, Lieutenant,

1112
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,117
we give the orders to the Army.

1113
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:27,622
Senator, if we could it'd be best
to discuss this in my office.

1114
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:29,666
As you wish.

1115
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:33,169
Senator, thank you so much.

1116
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:36,214
Don't thank me now.
It's still an uphill battle.

1117
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,258
- Yes, sir.
- Gentlemen.

1118
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:05,034
Do you think they'll ever free 'em?

1119
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,789
Eventually...
they'll have to send 'em home.

1120
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,751
Why'd you leave?

1121
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:20,508
Because my bad outweighs my good.

1122
01:26:22,051 --> 01:26:23,469
Why'd you come back?

1123
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,766
E.B., I'm getting old
and running out of time, so...

1124
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,728
with what I have left,

1125
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:38,067
I need to make right many wrongs.

1126
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,532
- What have ya there?
- It's a brand.

1127
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,409
One I want to use on my own cattle.

1128
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:50,246
Planning on following in
your father's footsteps?

1129
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,335
Papa always told me a brand is one
of the most important things.

1130
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:59,839
A brand is something that's permanently
a part of something bigger.

1131
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:02,675
Painful though.

1132
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:07,889
Sure, hurts at first but pain goes away.

1133
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:09,849
Belonging is forever.

1134
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:12,518
Very true.

1135
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:49,430
Haha! Yes, sir!

1136
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,850
Look what the cat
finally decided to drug on in.

1137
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,352
They finally let you out.

1138
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,604
- It's a good day.
- Is that really you?

1139
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,733
Yes. Many of us have returned
to our lodges.

1140
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,527
Welcome home, brother!

1141
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:05,822
Today's the day for the real race.

1142
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,784
It ain't gonna be
much different from last time.

1143
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:12,078
Yeah. 'Cept it ain't your wedding day.

1144
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,790
