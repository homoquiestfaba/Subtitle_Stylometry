1
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,319
<i>We all come from the sea,</i>

2
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,056
but we are not all of the sea.

3
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,798
<i>Those of us who are,</i>
<i>we children of the tides,</i>

4
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,268
<i>must return to it</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

5
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,662
Four a thousand.
Five a thousand.

6
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:40,265
Six a thousand.
Seven a thousand.

7
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,867
Eight a thousand.

8
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,268
Nine a thousand.

9
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,674
One a thousand.
Two a thousand.

10
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,777
Three a thousand.
Four a thousand.

11
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,178
Five a thousand.

12
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,314
Six a thousand.

13
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,349
Seven a thousand.
Eight a thousand.

14
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,851
The ball! Go over there!

15
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,686
Pick it up, pick it up,
pick it up.

16
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,521
- Ten a thousand.
- Come on!

17
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,290
Eleven a thousand.

18
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,426
Come on, Jay, let's go!
We're gonna get wet.

19
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:11,396
Man, did you see that?
It's building!

20
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,832
That was the longest one yet.

21
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,469
One a thousand.
Two a thousand.

22
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,872
Oh.
Three a thousand.

23
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,373
Four a thousand.

24
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,142
Five...
Sophie, no!

25
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,353
Jay, no! Look out!

26
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,491
Jay!

27
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,892
Oh, yeah, you're
smiling now, big shot.

28
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,594
But if I hadn't
paddled around the Point

29
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,229
at that exact moment...

30
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,297
It's a miracle,
that's what it is.

31
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,700
And I don't believe in miracles.
How old are you?

32
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,636
What, six, seven?
Eight.

33
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,471
And three quarters, sir.

34
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,241
Well, you just used up your
entire allotment of dumb luck.

35
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,576
Here's a novel idea.

36
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,446
On your next little date,
why don't you go to the arcade?

37
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,314
Or pee-wee golfing.

38
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,817
Or something that doesn't
involve getting you killed.

39
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,852
Because he likes to time
the waves.

40
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,722
- Shh.
- What? You do.

41
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,323
What do you mean,
time the waves?

42
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,862
Um, to see if the swell
is building or dropping.

43
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,298
The more seconds between them

44
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,668
each wave in a set,
it means it's getting bigger.

45
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,570
Who taught you that?

46
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,372
Nobody, sir.

47
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,474
Just figured it out.

48
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,377
You just figured that out
on your own?

49
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,047
Okay.

50
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,459
Thanks. Bye.

51
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,061
- Bye. Okay.
- Bye.

52
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,896
Go straight inside, all right?

53
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,033
Close the door.

54
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,945
What now?

55
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,415
How big you reckon
that wave was, sir?

56
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,050
It's a small world, kid,

57
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,986
but how they gauge the size
of waves, well, that differs

58
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,423
from place to place,
so, hard to say.

59
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,792
So it might be bigger
somewhere else?

60
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,531
Look, it was definitely
big enough, okay?

61
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,347
Like I said, kid, small world.

62
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,486
I appreciate you
saving Sophie, Jay.

63
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,489
One of the bravest things
I've ever seen.

64
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,906
Mom?

65
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,831
Mom?

66
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,184
Hi, baby.

67
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,987
Unh. Sorry,
Mama's not feeling so good.

68
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:09,461
Don't worry,
Dad will change his mind.

69
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,965
There are hot dogs
in the fridge.

70
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,810
Hey.

71
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,013
Hey.
Need a hand?

72
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,850
Hey. What with,
the coffee or the cupboard?

73
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:11,189
Uh, you just missed
Roque again.

74
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:14,025
Just put her down.

75
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,194
Ahem. Yeah.

76
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,029
I had to help
a friend out after work.

77
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,098
Mm-hm.

78
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,567
I'll go in,
I'll give her a kiss.

79
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,906
Kiss would be nice.

80
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,176
Conversation every once
in a while, maybe nicer.

81
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,650
Time to wake up, Jay.

82
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,754
Okay.

83
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,989
How do I look?

84
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,924
You look awesome.

85
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,595
I have an interview at Sears.

86
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,597
So, I'm coming home at 12:00

87
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,999
and we are going
to get school supplies.

88
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,634
Good luck.

89
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,235
Thank you.

90
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,273
Excuse me. Ma'am?

91
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,342
Hi.
Your husband home?

92
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:13,078
Uh, well,
depends on who's asking.

93
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm Jay Moriarty, ma'am.

94
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,682
He saved my life
down at Three Mile yesterday.

95
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,918
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry,
I think you're mistaken

96
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,654
because Frosty was up in Scott's
Valley laying roof yesterday.

97
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,924
No, ma'am. He was surfing
the exact same time

98
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,759
I used up my allotment
of dumb luck.

99
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,395
Is that so?

100
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:34,099
Frosty is actually
down at The Point right now

101
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,936
but is there anything that I can
help you with, Jay Moriarty?

102
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:43,875
Well, I seem to be missing parts
on the bottom of my board.

103
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,847
Okay.

104
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,849
Fins, fins, fins.

105
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,720
- Where does he keep them? Oh.
- Wow.

106
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,693
They call that thing a gun.

107
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,130
It's for riding
the really big monsters.

108
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,364
Like that.

109
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,134
Where is that?

110
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,935
You should ask Frosty yourself.

111
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,137
Thanks.

112
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,370
Beat it, little trash.

113
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,571
Blondie, what are you doing?

114
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,408
Hey, man, you got to go in.

115
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,876
You're bleeding.

116
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:35,146
I can't.
Not until I get up.

117
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,850
Dude, believe me, nobody
gets up their first time.

118
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,985
Okay, okay.
I'm only doing this

119
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,587
because you're gonna start
attracting sharks

120
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,189
with all that blood.

121
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:47,158
When I say "now,"
you paddle as hard as you can

122
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,260
towards shore, you got it?

123
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,429
Now?
No.

124
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,866
Now?
No.

125
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,436
Now?
Yeah! Paddle, paddle, paddle.

126
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,477
Hey, paddle.
Paddle, paddle, paddle! Now!

127
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,512
Go, go, go!

128
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,514
Yeah!

129
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,317
You stealing a page out
of my playbook there?

130
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,420
Couldn't help myself, Blondie.

131
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,223
It's always been a keeper.

132
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,561
Hey, little trash.

133
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,498
Got a question for you.
Yeah.

134
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,466
What exactly are you
trying to compensate for

135
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,702
with this long board
of yours? Huh?

136
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:41,272
I was about to ask you
the same thing about that bat.

137
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,411
Y'all come back now, you hear?

138
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,348
Come on, let's go!

139
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,549
Okay, okay, we're coming.

140
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,251
Sometime today, please.

141
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,388
Hey, Kim.

142
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,691
Hi! How was it out there?

143
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,526
Good. Feels like
the swell is building.

144
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:04,295
Yeah? Did you time it?

145
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,130
Kimmy, come on, we got to go.

146
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,200
Um, all right, well,
maybe I'll see you out there.

147
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,403
Later. Whoo!

148
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,043
Let her be, dude.

149
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,579
She's too old for you.

150
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,350
- Get out!
- Get out of my house! Aah!

151
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,151
- Get down!
- Mom!

152
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,686
And you stay down there!
I'm tired of this!

153
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,222
- Get off me! Okay?
- Mom!

154
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,457
I'm not going anywhere!

155
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,725
Jay.

156
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,327
Easy, kid.
This is about back rent!

157
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,363
She tried grabbing me!
All I did...

158
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,630
He owes us money!

159
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,466
Get off me! Unh!

160
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,534
No!
Take it easy, kid!

161
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,769
Jay! No!

162
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,305
Jay! Jay, stop, stop! Jay!

163
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,144
Cops! Cops!
Just let him go! Come on!

164
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,614
Hey, hey! Break it up!
Break it up!

165
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,185
Get off me!

166
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,759
This is Victor-1-2.
We're on the scene.

167
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,284
<i>Offshore
buoys are reporting seas</i>

168
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,219
<i>of 25 feet at 16 seconds.</i>

169
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,125
<i>Coming from the west</i>
<i>northwest at 295 degrees.</i>

170
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,561
Northwest winds are forecasted
<i>at 15 to 20 knots.</i>

171
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,564
<i>Swells are expected</i>
<i>to reach up to 28 feet</i>

172
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,766
<i>at 17 seconds near shore.</i>

173
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,833
Morning, Frank.

174
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,335
Careful out there, son.

175
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,492
Hey, buddy.
What's up?

176
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,797
Next level out
there today, boys.

177
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,232
Twenty-five at 16.

178
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,768
Let's rock and roll.

179
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,370
Right.

180
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,704
Let's do it.

181
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,913
Yeah, Frosty!

182
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,824
Now, we'll agree to
forget how you got up here,

183
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,826
but as far as most
are concerned,

184
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,896
that wave's a myth.
Like the Loch Ness monster.

185
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,465
The four of us who surf there
want to keep it that way.

186
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,666
Is that clear?

187
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,071
<i>Buoys reporting
swells of 28 feet</i>

188
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:21,972
<i>at 17 seconds coming from...</i>

189
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,915
How big was that wave?

190
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,817
Did you hear what I just said?

191
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,420
Yes, sir.

192
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,822
Loch Ness monster.

193
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,737
How's it going over there?

194
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,573
Mom's not renting out
the back anymore.

195
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,441
Means I get my own room.

196
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,977
But I got to double-up
my shifts at Pleasure Pizza.

197
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,047
And your father?

198
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,917
He wrote me a letter
a few years back

199
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,119
from his base in Panama.

200
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,122
So what'd he say?

201
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,459
I don't know.

202
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,128
Never opened it.

203
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,767
All right, well,

204
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,569
I got to get out of here.
Got to get to work.

205
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,776
Hey, sir, I want
to ride that wave.

206
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,177
I want to take that drop.

207
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,678
Not gonna happen.

208
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,480
Why not?

209
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,883
Because untrained boys
don't step in the ring

210
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,851
with Mike Tyson, that's why.

211
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,954
I can handle it.
You don't just do it.

212
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,791
Buddy, I've been surfing
that break for 20 years.

213
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,493
You have any idea how much
strength and know-how you need

214
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,795
to survive a break like that?

215
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,696
Frosty, I'm getting
stronger by the day.

216
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,166
I'll hold my own.

217
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,902
Stronger by the day, huh?
Yeah.

218
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,638
Okay, give me your hand.

219
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,973
Now resist me.

220
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,442
Okay, that all you got?

221
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,212
Is that it? Is that it?

222
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,048
Ow. Ow, ow, ow.
Okay.

223
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,117
You ain't strong enough.

224
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,788
Right now, I'm surfing every
single day, right? So, if I...

225
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,157
Shut up, all right?

226
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,926
Now, I know how good you are.

227
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,928
I've seen you out there.

228
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,631
You surf circles around
those other kids.

229
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,634
But those are normal waves.

230
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,770
Surfing normal waves
is about how you perform

231
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,672
when everything goes right.

232
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:37,942
Now, big wave surfing,
that's a different ball game.

233
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:40,478
That's about how you perform
when everything goes wrong.

234
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,682
One bump off the face
of that wave,

235
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,517
and you're hitting the water
like concrete

236
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,918
at 50 miles an hour.

237
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,620
And you got a thousand tons
of water

238
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,121
coming down on top of you.

239
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,691
It's knocking you senseless,
ripping you apart

240
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,827
and pushing you down to a place
that is so deep and so dark,

241
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,231
you don't want to be there.

242
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,967
So why do it?

243
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:09,840
Hey. Come on, get out of here.
I got work to do.

244
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,910
Train me, then.
Train me to ride it.

245
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,211
Did you hear what I said?

246
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,580
Go on, get.

247
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,993
You don't get it, do you?

248
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,701
What?

249
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,805
There are all kinds of sons,
Frosty, you know?

250
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:45,142
Some are born to you
and some just occur to you.

251
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,246
Jay's looked up to you
his entire life.

252
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,715
I mean, can't you see
how much he needs you?

253
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,984
You want me to teach
him to surf that wave?

254
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,153
He's a kid.

255
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,088
You made me promise
I wouldn't even surf that...

256
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,590
Yeah,
and you break that promise

257
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,025
every chance you get.

258
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:03,027
You think I don't know
where you were this morning?

259
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:04,728
I heard the message
on the machine.

260
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,230
"25 at 16"? Come on.

261
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,132
I don't know where
you're going with this.

262
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:11,201
That boy's gonna surf that wave
anyway. You know that, right?

263
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,871
Even if he dies trying.

264
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,907
I mean, wouldn't you?

265
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:45,336
Okay, two Hawaiians,
two Santa Barbara,

266
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,237
one pepperoni and one cheese.
All right.

267
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,906
Thank you.

268
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,877
Dude. Dude.

269
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,714
It goes, first sauce,
then cheese, then toppings.

270
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:59,116
It's not rocket science.

271
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,353
You all right? You haven't been
here since you got here, man.

272
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:05,623
You ever see something
and you think,

273
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,224
like, it's the reason
you were put here?

274
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,826
I mean, like, on this earth?

275
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,928
Sure, man.

276
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,830
Every time I turn on <i>Baywatch.</i>

277
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,235
Right, keep it moving.

278
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,971
Pleasure Pizza. Okay.

279
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,673
Hey, Blond, I'll be right back.

280
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,675
Hold on, hold on. Hey, dude,
where are you going now?

281
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:26,810
- I'll be right back.
- You're killing me here!

282
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,712
Hi, sir.

283
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,247
Okay, here's the deal.

284
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,116
I'm gonna train you
for one thing

285
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,717
and for one thing only:

286
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,020
To survive that wave.
All right?

287
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,421
You want to know why?

288
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:40,391
Because I don't want it
on my conscience.

289
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:41,959
That's it.

290
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,994
No questions, no arguing,
end of story.

291
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,031
I teach you what you need
to know, and it's over.

292
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,033
You got it?
Got it.

293
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:52,836
Now, the reason
no one knows about this wave

294
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,239
is because it only happens
on big northwest swells.

295
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:58,676
And the window for those swells
closes in 12 weeks.

296
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,010
So you got 12 weeks.

297
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,915
Meet me in my shed
tomorrow morning, 6:30 a.m.

298
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,984
Not 6:31 or 6:32.

299
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,224
Yes! Yes! Yes!

300
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,435
Hey. Ooh.

301
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:28,172
Don't bother with that.
We're not surfing.

302
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,443
Paddleboards.

303
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:34,078
All right. Unh.

304
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,915
A few things we need to
establish before we begin.

305
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,183
The first,

306
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,252
thou shalt not ding
Frosty's board

307
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,487
or damage thy neighbor's car.

308
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:46,056
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

309
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,760
Second,
this little, uh, program

310
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:52,796
is all about building
what I like to call

311
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,034
the four pillars of a solid
human foundation. Understand?

312
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,903
Yes, sir.

313
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,206
How could you? I haven't even
told you what they are.

314
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,510
Steady rhythm.

315
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,011
Drive and glide.

316
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,259
The four pillars
of the human foundation

317
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,795
are the physical, the mental,

318
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:28,031
the emotional
and the spiritual.

319
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,100
Though I admit
to being a little bit wobbly

320
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,102
in that department.

321
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,937
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

322
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,540
You know what a thesis is?

323
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,842
Uh, an idea.

324
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:42,045
Exactly. An idea which attempts
to explain something.

325
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,114
Lays it out to be
proved or disproved.

326
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,116
So here's our thesis:

327
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,520
It's 36 miles across the bay
from Santa Cruz to Monterey.

328
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:52,389
The day that you can
paddle that far

329
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,992
will be the day
you're ready to surf Mavericks.

330
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,493
Not a moment sooner.

331
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,895
Frosty, that's impossible.

332
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:00,531
Oh, more so than you know.

333
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,267
So the physical will represent
the sheer strength

334
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,068
needed to make the paddle.

335
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,271
So you're gonna be doing this
from now on, every day,

336
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:08,939
12 weeks.

337
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:13,177
And the mental will be tied
to your own research.

338
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,312
The calculation
of the tides and swells,

339
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,414
and, of course, your ability
to navigate them all.

340
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,287
So, Monterey equals Mavericks.
Deal?

341
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,891
Deal.
Good. All I need

342
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,393
is for your mom
to sign me a permission slip

343
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,161
accepting responsibility

344
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,363
for anything that's
gonna happen along the way.

345
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,566
Whoa. Frosty.

346
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:39,169
Hey, Frosty, what if
she doesn't sign it?

347
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:43,307
Deep breaths, steady rhythm.
Drive and glide.

348
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,319
Hey, Sophie.
What's up, girl?

349
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,855
Come here, Sophie.
Shh.

350
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,923
Sophie. What are you...?

351
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,226
What are you doing here?
My parents are asleep.

352
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,461
Can you sign me
a permission slip

353
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:07,030
with my mom's signature on it?
My handwriting blows.

354
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:11,168
Hey. A permission slip?
For what?

355
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,204
Okay, I haven't told this
to anyone

356
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,240
so you have to promise
to keep it a secret.

357
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,542
Okay, promise.

358
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,944
It's Mavericks.
I mean, it's real.

359
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,547
Maybe the biggest wave
in the world.

360
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,383
I've seen it with my own eyes,
it's right up the coast.

361
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,553
Frosty's gonna train me
to surf it.

362
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,089
Mavericks?
No one believes that.

363
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,391
I swear, it's like nothing
you've ever seen before.

364
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,226
And if I ask my mom
for permission,

365
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,328
it'll just give her an excuse
to act like my mom for once

366
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,063
and she'll probably say no.

367
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,270
You look great.
Thanks.

368
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,138
I would've asked you at school,
but I know you don't like

369
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,907
being seen in public
with younger men, so...

370
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,520
Hey, Blondie.

371
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,536
All right, fellas.

372
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,309
Come on, race you to the pool.

373
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,020
Ow!

374
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,430
Yeah! Sick!

375
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,971
Get some!

376
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,408
Whoo! Yeah!
Aah!

377
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,044
Yeah, man, get up.

378
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,713
Yeah.

379
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,048
Hey. Hollybra's having a party
tonight. You clowns going?

380
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,118
Yeah, sounds good to me.
Jay?

381
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,453
No, I got school and stuff.

382
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,588
Dude.

383
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,390
We all got school, dude.
That's no excuse.

384
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:14,758
Heard that. Haven't been
to class all week.

385
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,593
Yeah.

386
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:21,231
The dude actually wonders why
he's a second-year sophomore!

387
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,767
So, what kind of stuff
you got going?

388
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:27,204
Just trying to make sense
of everything.

389
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,106
We're in high school, dude.

390
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,681
Hey, Frosty.

391
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,316
Hey.

392
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,088
It's 20 to 4.

393
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,723
You told me to be here at 4.

394
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,492
Exactly.

395
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,429
So, we ready to go?
Does it look like it?

396
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,602
Tell you what, we'll be ready

397
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,637
when you clean up
that driveway.

398
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,107
That's what you get for
being 20 minutes early.

399
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,552
Deep breaths.

400
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:19,389
You got to stretch
out those lungs.

401
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,459
A wave like Mavericks will hold
you down for minutes at a time

402
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,161
while it pounds you to a pulp.

403
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,762
If you can't hold your breath

404
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:28,632
for at least four minutes
under normal circumstances,

405
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,667
then you may as well
not even paddle out.

406
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,382
How long was that?

407
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,319
You know what, I'm not even
gonna acknowledge

408
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,654
that just happened.

409
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,642
Hey.

410
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,679
Where'd you find that?

411
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:21,318
In the dresser that you
moved into the baby's room.

412
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,223
Hm.
God, you're so beautiful.

413
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,325
Mm.

414
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:40,337
Look, um, I know that surfing

415
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:44,241
is your passion and your life,
your escape.

416
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:45,742
I get it.

417
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,312
But I need you to
make me a promise.

418
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,416
And I'm serious this time.

419
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,756
That you're not gonna put
the rush of a 30-foot drop

420
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,225
in front of the future
of your two children.

421
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,636
I promise.

422
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,340
God, you're a good man.

423
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,778
Okay.

424
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,346
Jay's waiting for you.

425
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,356
Mom!

426
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,925
Mom, you got to get up
right now!

427
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,793
You got a 6:00 shift!

428
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,829
You're gonna lose
your job again! Mom!

429
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,531
Oh, no.

430
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,570
Mom, get up! Come on!
I'm getting up!

431
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,304
Hey.

432
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,374
You're 11 minutes late.

433
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,509
Yeah, sorry, Frosty.
You know, my mom...

434
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,311
She had to write
my permission slip, so...

435
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,821
Your mother's got
nice handwriting.

436
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,658
She take much convincing?

437
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,428
No.

438
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,397
Not much.

439
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,733
Good.

440
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,742
That your breakfast?

441
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,710
Hm? Yeah.

442
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,782
You want to be an athlete,
you got to eat like one.

443
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,317
Take this.

444
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,487
Go on, take it.

445
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:11,888
You're gonna need it
more than me.

446
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,891
Thanks.

447
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,793
<i>Winds out
of the south, southeast</i>

448
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,329
<i>at 15 knots,</i>
<i>gusting to 20 knots.</i>

449
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,398
That's the Weather Radio, huh?

450
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,799
You use it to follow big surf?

451
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,901
Kind of like you
timing the waves.

452
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,003
Only this thing's
a little more accurate.

453
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:39,983
There's no way
to paddle out there,

454
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,918
especially with long boards.

455
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,555
Oh, there's a way, all right.

456
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,358
So let's see if you're
worth your salt, chief.

457
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,575
Okay, back to baking.

458
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,845
Let's go.

459
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:46,049
So you made it all of 30 yards.

460
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,618
If you want to get out there,
you got to make it

461
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,153
through more than half
a mile of this

462
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:52,155
just to get in position
of Mavericks.

463
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:55,992
So you've got to conserve
all the energy you've got.

464
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,962
All right.

465
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:01,097
Now let's take a look
at what you missed.

466
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,868
Now, for some reason,
you decided

467
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,971
to paddle straight out
into that mess.

468
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,174
Now, take a look
at the rocks over there.

469
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,877
See what's happening
with the current?

470
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,814
It's got nowhere to go.
Nowhere to go but where?

471
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,019
Back out?
Exactly, back out.

472
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,954
To a waterman,

473
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,591
it's a conveyor belt.

474
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,160
Watch this.

475
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,923
<i>So today's lesson</i>

476
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,926
was about the power
of observation.

477
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,662
Simple fact
is you got two choices.

478
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,497
You can fight things head-on

479
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:10,533
or you can observe
the laws of nature.

480
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,702
Because if you
look hard enough,

481
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,671
there's always
a way through it.

482
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:17,941
Make sense?
Yes, sir.

483
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:19,676
Good man.

484
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:22,111
Because you're going to
write me an essay about it.

485
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:26,549
Three pages,
typewritten, single-space.

486
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:30,086
Devil's in the details
of whatever you observe.

487
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,556
Time to start building
your mental pillar, chief.

488
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,699
Hey, Kimmy.

489
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,135
Oh, my gosh!
Are you okay?

490
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,570
Yeah.

491
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,005
Oh, man.

492
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,273
What are you doing?

493
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:53,843
Uh, I just
got off work. You?

494
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,112
Oh, um, I was just trying
to go for a swim,

495
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,147
but I guess they close
early on Sundays.

496
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,116
You want to go swimming
at night,

497
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,718
you got to use
the back entrance.

498
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,255
Hey, this isn't so bad.

499
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:15,064
Okay, so how do we get down?

500
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:17,300
There's only one way I know of.

501
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,969
What? No. Are you serious?

502
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,238
No. Jay!

503
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,740
Hey.

504
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:27,577
I saw your bike.
You didn't tell me.

505
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:32,148
So she know the rules?
No.

506
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,150
Clear it. Clear it.
Excuse me.

507
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,752
It's kind of like
figure skating.

508
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,621
Points based on a combination
of style,

509
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,790
execution and difficulty.

510
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:44,027
For example, I'm going to start
with a standing one and a half.

511
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:48,932
High, I repeat,
high level of difficulty.

512
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,167
Because I got to clear
the pool deck.

513
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:54,904
Hit that,
you're immediately DQ'd.

514
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,839
No. Wait, wait, wait.
You guys aren't serious.

515
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,207
Really? No!

516
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,179
Oh...
Oh!

517
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,182
And the judges say...

518
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,884
- Oh, my gosh.
- Nice one, Blondie.

519
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:11,020
The only thing that can top
that is a reverse back tuck.

520
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:14,023
Because of the blind entry.
No! I can't watch this.

521
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,792
You have to.

522
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:17,827
You're the only judge.

523
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,095
No, Jay!

524
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:27,303
Whoo!

525
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,972
Look at this! Yeah!

526
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:38,681
And the judge turned competitor
ties it with Moriarty.

527
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:40,350
- No.
- No, no, no!

528
00:43:40,352 --> 00:43:42,085
To see who the real
champion will be

529
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:45,321
we're down
to a final sprint. Whoo!

530
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,270
Ooh!

531
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:02,872
Hey, you cheater!

532
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,073
Ooh.
You are disqualified.

533
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,274
Why?

534
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,809
Because you pulled my ankle!

535
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,277
I would have won that!

536
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:09,679
Whatever.

537
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:16,352
Forty.

538
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,223
What are you doing?

539
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:23,259
Four pillars
of a solid human foundation.

540
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:25,762
Fifty.
Mm-hm.

541
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,524
I made coffee,
your clothes are in the dryer.

542
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,941
I'm swallowing water.

543
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,376
Well, you better grow gills.

544
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:43,279
You got two more minutes.

545
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,090
Yo, dude!

546
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,467
Three pages.

547
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,335
Congratulations.

548
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,805
You eaten?

549
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,422
It's good.

550
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,235
Oh. Thank you.

551
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:13,970
You're welcome.

552
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,974
Is this some sort of a joke?

553
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,079
No, sir.

554
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:26,249
So I ask you to write an essay,
and you observe a girl.

555
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,788
You never told me
what to observe.

556
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,256
Oh, come on, Jay.
Really?

557
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:36,559
I'm training you
to survive Mavericks,

558
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:39,061
not some, uh, silly teen crush.

559
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,863
Roque, go to bed.

560
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,866
Good night, Daddy.

561
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,503
I just thought...

562
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,839
What did you think?
What did you think, Jay?

563
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,043
Nothing.

564
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:55,878
If you didn't think,
you're wasting my time.

565
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,914
Frosty.
Okay? And that's not something

566
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:59,982
I got a lot of these days.

567
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,584
You know what?
It's not your fault.

568
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:04,220
You're 15.
You're just a kid.

569
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:07,356
Jay, um, will you
excuse us for a moment?

570
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:12,895
For heaven's sake, Frosty,

571
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:15,598
not everyone sees the world
through your eyes.

572
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,400
Okay? He chose
to examine something

573
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:19,068
that meant the world to him.

574
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,404
Something personal,

575
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:23,606
which he opened up
and shared with you,

576
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:26,042
entrusted to you.

577
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,578
Brenda, I'm not concerned
with his feelings.

578
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,180
I'm concerned
with the objective.

579
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,049
The point of writing an essay

580
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:35,084
is to put your thoughts
down on paper

581
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,019
and see the gaps and reflect.

582
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,055
And did he accomplish that
or not?

583
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,361
I don't know. I...

584
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,898
My old man, he didn't even...

585
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,333
Shh, shh, shh.

586
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,608
It just takes patience.

587
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,344
You owe yourself that much.

588
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:04,213
Okay?

589
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,915
Okay.

590
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,918
I don't hear Lake.

591
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,126
Hey.

592
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,962
He just needed to be held,
I think.

593
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:22,198
Don't we all sometimes?

594
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,473
All right, chief, sit down.

595
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:38,114
From now on, let's stick
to the subject at hand.

596
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:41,250
First off, I want you
to rewrite this essay,

597
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,287
but you can observe
an actual break.

598
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,655
As in surf break.

599
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:47,423
Mr. Lopez.

600
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,991
Here.

601
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:50,526
- Miss Mirkin.
- Here.

602
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:51,994
Mr. Moriarty.

603
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,499
Mr. Moriarty.

604
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,684
<i>Mavericks. November
10th, 9:13 a.m.</i>

605
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:17,286
<i>Swell westerly,</i>
<i>approximately 12 feet</i>

606
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,021
<i>at 16-second intervals,</i>

607
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,693
<i>25- to 30-foot faces.</i>

608
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,964
<i>One of Frosty's crew</i>
<i>heading out solo.</i>

609
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:32,168
<i>Looking like the best way out</i>
<i>is to ride the current</i>

610
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,703
<i>inside the rocks.</i>

611
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:38,174
<i>Wind remains side-shore,</i>
<i>maybe 10 knots.</i>

612
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:44,180
<i>Set suddenly shifting</i>
<i>with no warning.</i>

613
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:47,416
<i>Large and northerly,</i>
<i>at least double the size.</i>

614
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,503
Come on, come on.

615
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,292
Hey, man.

616
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:37,626
Hey, Brenda.

617
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,728
How's it going?
It's good.

618
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,131
Yeah? I'm curious to hear
how it is from the one

619
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:43,732
on the other end of the whip.

620
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,868
You know, just
keeping me on my toes.

621
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,670
Not being too hard
on you, is he?

622
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:50,706
No. No, I feel like it's
the other way around, maybe.

623
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,310
How so?

624
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:59,148
Sometimes, when you've been
through a lot in life,

625
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,870
you know, sometimes
you're hard on yourself.

626
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,321
That's the way it is with
my mom, at least, you know?

627
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,858
You sure you're only
in high school?

628
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,160
Yeah.

629
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:13,496
Bye.

630
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,798
See you.

631
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,333
See you guys. Take it easy.

632
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,812
Looks like your girlfriend's
keeping tabs on you.

633
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,780
- Ha, ha.
- Yo, who's that?

634
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,216
Oh, he's cool.
All right, later.

635
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,190
What's this?

636
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:43,893
You my keeper
all of a sudden? Hey.

637
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:45,528
You having this
conversation with me

638
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,396
or your conscience, Blond?

639
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,901
I just wanted to tell you,
it's your turn to lock up.

640
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,375
Jay?

641
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,526
Aah! Oh, my God.

642
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:52,361
1:46.

643
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:53,929
Almost two full minutes.

644
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,403
Jay, can I talk to you?

645
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:02,671
Uh, hold on.

646
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,713
Come in.

647
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,815
Hey.
Hey.

648
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:14,617
Hey, your uniform's, um...
It's in the dryer.

649
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:15,851
Oh. Thank you. Thanks.

650
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:18,354
Okay.

651
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:20,889
Um, listen, I was wondering
if I could borrow $15.

652
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:23,892
I got a parking ticket,

653
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,862
and, you know, if you
don't pay them, it's...

654
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,466
Yeah.

655
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,009
I'm gonna pay you back.

656
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,480
I promise.

657
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,982
Thanks.

658
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,043
Hey. You heading out, Blond?

659
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:15,511
Like you care.

660
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:16,779
Sonny!

661
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,515
Outside!

662
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,696
Oh-oh-oh.

663
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:36,065
Boy can get it done.

664
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,708
If that's what you call
snaking someone's wave, man,

665
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,809
Guess we can't all be
as perfect as you, can we, Jay?

666
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:50,379
Blond, you're better than that.

667
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:52,815
All right?
Let's go get some.

668
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:19,027
Whoo! Yeah!

669
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,261
Hey.

670
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,268
You're back early.

671
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,203
What you doing?

672
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,738
You know, it's, uh...

673
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,006
He wanted to surprise you.

674
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,880
Well, he succeeded.

675
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,651
Carry on.

676
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:19,121
You're the worst!
You're the worst!

677
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,323
Hey, did you see
that big outside set?

678
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:23,659
It was firing today!

679
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,565
Careful, man. He's wasted.

680
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:31,066
Uh, yeah, let me get a, um...

681
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,202
A hot dog, extra chili.

682
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:37,139
Ahem. No, check that.
Make it a jelly donut.

683
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:39,608
All we got is pizza, bro.

684
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:43,045
Hey, little trash,

685
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:46,214
why are you always smiling
all the time, huh?

686
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:47,916
Oh, there you go again.

687
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,319
You see, when you smile,
you look like a little wuss.

688
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:51,787
When you look
like a little wuss,

689
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:52,988
you don't get no respect.

690
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:55,657
Sure got it today.

691
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:00,662
Hey! Hey! Hey, get off!

692
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,900
Come on! Get off me, man!

693
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:07,169
You throw a punch,
you better pray

694
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:09,671
I don't make it back up,
you little punk.

695
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:13,108
Yeah, you think you're better
than the rest of us, don't you?

696
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,778
I see you paddling out there
every morning with Frosty.

697
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,814
Come on, man,
let's get out of here.

698
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:20,882
Paddle, paddle, paddle,
little grom.

699
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,084
Let's go, bro.

700
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,685
Let's get out of here.

701
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,893
Looks like you
dropped something.

702
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,241
I read your essay.

703
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,778
What do you think?

704
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,947
I think that's what I expected
from you all along.

705
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,185
You done good, chief.

706
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,225
And now the lion sleeps.

707
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,395
The wave's gonna break
behind us

708
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:07,796
where the reef falls

709
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:10,432
from about 40 feet
to about 1500 feet.

710
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:12,267
Here's what you want to avoid:

711
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,269
Firstly, see those rocks
over there?

712
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:16,138
They call that the Boneyard.

713
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,341
Whatever you do, do not let
the current push you in there.

714
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:20,976
It'll smash you to pieces.

715
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,412
So where do you set?

716
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:26,381
What you got to do
is triangulate.

717
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:30,118
You draw a line
between yourself and that dish

718
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,954
and that mushroom rock
over there.

719
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:36,258
The biggest treachery of all
is what lies underneath.

720
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,770
<i>Most waves break on reefs</i>

721
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:51,239
<i>less than 20 feet</i>
<i>beneath the surface.</i>

722
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,476
<i>Depth is doubled out here.</i>

723
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,314
<i>Meaning, when it's firing,</i>
<i>you got twice the water mass,</i>

724
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,717
<i>twice the wave energy,</i>

725
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,153
<i>and twice the likelihood</i>
<i>of drowning.</i>

726
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:55,237
Don't worry.
I got your back, kid.

727
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,544
What happened?

728
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:04,379
What do you mean?
I just saw a 15-foot shark.

729
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,248
I'm sure it scared
the piss out of you,

730
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:10,118
but that wasn't what I asked.
Why'd you panic?

731
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,155
Just fear, I guess.

732
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:15,090
All right, well,
one thing you got to know,

733
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:18,326
fear and panic
are two separate emotions.

734
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:21,530
Fear is healthy,
panic is deadly.

735
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:24,032
Because when this place
is firing

736
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:26,868
and I'm talking
about 30-, 40-foot waves,

737
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,271
it's all about fear.

738
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:31,273
But you panic out there,
like you just did,

739
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:32,841
you die.

740
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:35,977
Well,
if you're scared to death,

741
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,245
how do you not panic?

742
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:39,247
By identifying the fear

743
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,249
and what it is
you're afraid of.

744
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,018
Not just out there,
but in life.

745
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,955
Welcome to your next essay.

746
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:05,841
All right, guys, listen up.
Uh, homework assignment, okay?

747
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:08,610
Put your pencils down.
Don't write until I'm done.

748
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:11,580
Gotta listen first, okay?
Here we go.

749
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:14,282
Name the four
sophila of arthropods.

750
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:17,452
Which sophila is thought
to be the eldest?

751
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:21,056
Which sophila is thought
to be the eldest? Number one.

752
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:25,894
Number two: Compare complete
and incomplete metamor...

753
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:32,300
There he goes again.

754
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,511
Hey.
Hey.

755
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:46,314
I was hoping I'd see you here.

756
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,552
Um, we're doing a bonfire
down at the cove.

757
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:52,120
You want to stop by after work?

758
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:55,223
Oh, thanks, you know,
but I got to...

759
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,259
Where's the action?

760
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:59,361
I want to party!

761
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:06,501
You know, come on.
I got a better idea.

762
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:09,504
Yeah, okay, that's $14.56.

763
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,975
Dude, no. What?

764
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:15,610
I'll owe you forever, Blond.

765
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:17,913
- What's up?
- I promise.

766
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:24,686
Oh, hey.
Dude, you dropped your, uh...

767
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,041
Hey.
You're home.

768
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:49,244
Yeah, I finished up early,
so I thought I'd get back.

769
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:50,545
Is Roque in her room?

770
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:54,249
Yeah,
she's getting ready for bed.

771
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:57,218
What's in the bag?
Oh.

772
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,721
My old man used to read
to me as a kid,

773
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:03,024
and I thought,
you know, maybe...

774
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:07,162
Maybe I would start reading
to Roque.

775
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:09,698
Okay.

776
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,440
Roque?

777
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:20,175
Hi, Daddy.

778
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:23,745
Hey, I take it this isn't
your first time here.

779
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,414
It's my first time
with anyone else.

780
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:38,560
Look, you see that?

781
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:41,529
That's the seventh brightest
star in the sky, Rigel.

782
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:42,998
Right above it, on either side,

783
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,599
that's Betelgeuse
and Bellatrix.

784
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,301
It's the shoulders of Orion.

785
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,606
What?
Ha, ha.

786
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:53,408
How'd you know that?

787
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,111
I learned it from my dad.

788
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,746
He started teaching me
about the stars

789
01:06:57,748 --> 01:07:00,782
when I was maybe, like, 3 or 4.

790
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:03,752
There are 88 constellations,

791
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:06,388
but I never got a chance
to learn them all.

792
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,231
Come on.

793
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:17,632
Follow me.

794
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,276
Whoa!

795
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:34,382
- Paddle, paddle, paddle!
- Come on, Kimmy!

796
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,117
Yeah!

797
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,419
Kimmy, give me your hand.

798
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:39,521
Get over here.
Kimmy, come on. Come on.

799
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,224
- Ow!
- No!

800
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,706
Frost, I saw you were counting

801
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,176
on your fingers when we were
diving at Mavericks.

802
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:04,679
The longer you're down
there, the more your mind unspools.

803
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:08,683
You mark each minute
with a finger.

804
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,752
Run out of fingers

805
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,253
and you know you're in trouble.

806
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,295
Feel the water getting colder?

807
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:22,363
Yeah.

808
01:08:22,365 --> 01:08:24,332
Because of what lies
beneath us.

809
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:28,303
It's the Monterey Trench,
5,280 feet deep.

810
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:29,771
Current drops in here,

811
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:33,274
heads east until it hits
the Southern Wall.

812
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,877
Creating what?
It's a back eddy.

813
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:37,579
You know,
the day you hit that eddy

814
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:40,181
is the day you'll be
more than halfway there.

815
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:41,749
Where'd you learn
all that stuff anyway?

816
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,651
From you.

817
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,520
I mean, from books and maps.

818
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:47,455
You told me to study
the currents and the tides.

819
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,425
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

820
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,731
Used to come out here

821
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:59,134
and just paddle out
to the deepest part.

822
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,904
Used to bob up and down
like a cork just...

823
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:05,373
Just to feel it.

824
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:10,411
To feel what?

825
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:12,213
The abyss.

826
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:21,422
The tide is
really strong today.

827
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:25,260
That's because of
tropical hurricanes from Japan.

828
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:27,362
Making their way
across the Pacific.

829
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:28,730
Really?

830
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:33,801
Only happens once
every seven to 10 years.

831
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:37,372
Last El Niño was '83.

832
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:38,840
Brought waves into Mavericks

833
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:42,477
the size
of five-story buildings.

834
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,214
Oh, yeah.
El Niño.

835
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:48,449
Do you think it'll
happen again this year?

836
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,785
I don't know.

837
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:54,522
But if it does,
you'd better be ready.

838
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,825
Because that wave of ours

839
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:59,761
ain't gonna be
a secret anymore.

840
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,264
So, girl I want you to know

841
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:22,817
Nice.

842
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:25,453
Thank you, ladies.

843
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,322
All right, I gotta
go get some wood.

844
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:28,590
No.

845
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,258
I got to keep you ladies warm.

846
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,660
Why don't you go help Daddy?

847
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:32,860
Bye.

848
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:34,329
Oh, no. You're leaving.

849
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:35,563
Yeah, swing shift calls.

850
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:39,801
No. Oh, good to see you.

851
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,606
So, wait,
where did you guys meet?

852
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:46,708
You're looking at it.
Really?

853
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:50,378
Yeah. This is where we
went on our first date.

854
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,481
He asked me out to dinner,
and before I know it,

855
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:55,917
he's, you know, spearing a fish

856
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,853
and cooking it over a campfire
like a caveman,

857
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:00,455
and I'm just sitting there

858
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:03,391
in my white taffeta dress
and my pearls,

859
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:05,627
you know, wondering
where my cutlery is.

860
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,299
Is all of his family here?

861
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,768
No, we're his only family.

862
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,738
Frosty lost both his folks
when he was young.

863
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,373
He doesn't really
talk about it much.

864
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:20,375
Kind of carries it
on the inside.

865
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,577
Always has.

866
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:25,046
Somehow,

867
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:30,752
it's just made him feel
unfit. Hey.

868
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:32,987
I don't know. It just...
It breaks my heart.

869
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,897
You take care of that boy,
you hear?

870
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,900
Yeah, I will.
Okay.

871
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,036
I mean, we're just friends,
but I'll take care of him.

872
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:50,371
- Just friends?
- Hey, hey.

873
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:52,473
Wow. Nice catch!
Anybody want to kiss a fish?

874
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,776
Not me.
Eh? Yeah.

875
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:56,077
No! No! Jay, no!

876
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,379
No! Do not get that
near me! No!

877
01:11:58,381 --> 01:11:59,781
No!

878
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,691
Hey.

879
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:12,794
What's up? Hey. How are you?

880
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,681
- Oh...
- Well, well.

881
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,550
Glad you showed up.

882
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:38,052
We came to see
the Mavericks man.

883
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,858
What are they doing here?

884
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,693
What are you, like,
Neighborhood Watch?

885
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,562
So, what's the
deal, little trash?

886
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:50,131
You gonna slay
that dragon by yourself

887
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:51,933
or is your
rent-a-dad gonna help?

888
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:00,441
"From a distance,
I watched and realized

889
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:04,479
"that along with rare beauty
comes constant scrutiny.

890
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:07,749
Like being the lead
in a school play."

891
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:12,854
That's poetic, man.

892
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:18,493
It's a shame she laughs at you
behind your back, though.

893
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:20,762
But, I mean, you already
knew that, right?

894
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:22,930
It's kind of obvious since
she won't be seen with you.

895
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:39,514
Paddle, paddle, paddle,
little grom.

896
01:13:39,516 --> 01:13:41,649
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

897
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,987
I'm not doing it again.

898
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:25,793
Okay, well, you know the deal.

899
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:28,529
You want to walk,
that's your choice.

900
01:14:28,531 --> 01:14:29,897
Why are you doing this to me?

901
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:31,699
Because I want the truth.

902
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:34,669
I want to know
what you're afraid of.

903
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:38,973
I don't know.

904
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,075
You don't know?
Or you don't wanna know?

905
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:42,677
I don't know.

906
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:45,780
Well, you better ask yourself,

907
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:47,982
what do you want
to leave behind?

908
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:51,953
The truth of who you really are
or just some words on a page?

909
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:54,856
All that stuff that's burning
deep down inside of you,

910
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:56,557
what is that?

911
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:57,992
That stuff
you can't even look at

912
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,594
because it scares you so much,

913
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:01,662
that the same thing
in that letter?

914
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,231
That letter
that you can't open...

915
01:15:03,233 --> 01:15:04,732
Don't.
But you can't even throw away.

916
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,734
Don't do this!
Don't do what?

917
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:08,870
If you don't even have
the courage

918
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:10,271
to open that letter,

919
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:12,073
then how can you
take on that wave?

920
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:15,576
Stop it! I don't know, okay?
I said I don't know.

921
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,949
Dad, quick, Mommy's sick.

922
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,856
Brenda.

923
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,992
Mommy?

924
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:34,562
Jay. Call 911.
I'm here, sweetheart.

925
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:36,597
I'm right here. Hurry.

926
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:39,267
Mommy. Mommy!

927
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:40,902
Yeah, yeah, we
have an emergency.

928
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,236
Babe, I'm with you.

929
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:44,005
I need you
to send an ambulance, please.

930
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:45,840
Jay, tell them
she's having a stroke.

931
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:47,575
I think she's having
a stroke. She can't talk.

932
01:15:47,577 --> 01:15:49,277
Just breathe, baby.

933
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:50,845
I don't know. I don't know.
She fell...

934
01:15:50,847 --> 01:15:52,747
Mommy! Mommy!

935
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:54,015
She's not moving.

936
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:57,552
Okay, babe. Baby, I got you.

937
01:15:57,554 --> 01:16:01,556
We're at 311 38th
Street, in Pleasant Point.

938
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,750
Hi.

939
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,052
How could this happen?

940
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:36,757
Jay, can we talk?

941
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,926
Please?

942
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,161
Are you okay?

943
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,029
No.

944
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,633
I have to go.

945
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:48,002
Okay.

946
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,757
Go away.

947
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:30,411
My grandchildren are wondering
where their father is.

948
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,982
No, they're wondering
where their mother is, sir.

949
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,717
Then tell them.

950
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,987
I don't know what to say.

951
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,056
Tell them the truth.

952
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,858
She's at the side of God
in heaven.

953
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:49,263
Well, I'm not sure
I believe that right now.

954
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,438
Maybe...

955
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:01,409
Maybe we'll take the kids
for a couple of days.

956
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:06,814
Yeah.

957
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,785
Those two children
have lost their mother.

958
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:16,157
Now don't deny them
the comfort of their father.

959
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,292
Now, come inside.

960
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,927
Why did he leave us, Mom?

961
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,203
He didn't leave us.

962
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:04,138
He left me.

963
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,852
Frosty?

964
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:21,388
Frost.

965
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,824
Hey, Frosty?

966
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:31,265
<i>Show Daddy
the soft baby rabbit.</i>

967
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,800
<i>Say, "Hi."</i>

968
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:35,102
<i>Say, "I love you, Daddy."</i>

969
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:40,274
<i>Can you show Daddy?</i>

970
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,976
<i>Show Daddy</i>
<i>the soft baby rabbit.</i>

971
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:43,978
<i>Say, "Hi." Can you say,</i>
<i>"I love you, Daddy."</i>

972
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,212
Frost?

973
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:47,515
<i>Hi, Daddy. She said, "Da!"</i>

974
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:49,383
<i>She said "Daddy."</i>

975
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:52,286
<i>That's good. Should we read</i>
<i>a story to Daddy?</i>

976
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,255
<i>Should we read a story...</i>

977
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,431
Deep breaths.

978
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:06,567
Steady rhythm.

979
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,869
Drive and glide.

980
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:18,946
Frosty!

981
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,123
Deep breaths.

982
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,558
Steady rhythm.

983
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,259
Drive and glide.

984
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:37,464
Frosty!

985
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,900
Frosty!

986
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,919
The current.

987
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:00,221
He floated with the current.

988
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:24,044
Frosty, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

989
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,580
You can't just
walk away from everything!

990
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:30,050
Why not? Huh? Why not?

991
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:39,460
She's all I had, Jay.

992
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:41,295
She's all I ever knew.

993
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:45,199
All I know, Frost,
is what you told me.

994
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:47,368
If you look hard enough,

995
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,904
there's always a way
through it.

996
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:51,639
But what if I don't
have the strength, Jay?

997
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,577
Which pillar do I lean on then?

998
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,480
The fifth one.

999
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,516
Which one is that?

1000
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:04,618
It's me.

1001
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,423
Come on.

1002
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:10,658
That's enough of this.

1003
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,662
Come on. It's time to go.

1004
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,432
Hey, Jay.

1005
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,401
You're going the wrong way.

1006
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:23,270
I felt the back eddy, Frost.

1007
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,372
That means we're more than
halfway across the bay.

1008
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,541
Closer to what's in front of us
than what's behind.

1009
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:38,385
Paddle, Frosty.

1010
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:15,689
Good morning.

1011
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,594
Did you forget what day it is?

1012
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:27,067
Oh. And this
is all of the money

1013
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:28,402
that I borrowed from you.

1014
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:31,472
Plus some interest.

1015
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,513
Mom, where did you get this?

1016
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:42,116
I was made the shift manager
because I'm so punctual.

1017
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:49,356
All right.
Open your present.

1018
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:02,636
Frosty said that
you might be needing that

1019
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:04,505
to follow the swells.

1020
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:10,811
And he said there is
a very big one coming.

1021
01:24:10,813 --> 01:24:13,747
It was hard to figure out what
he was talking about,

1022
01:24:13,749 --> 01:24:17,451
but they're calling it El Niño,
which means "the boy."

1023
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,057
You know that because
you got a C in Spanish. Hey.

1024
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:25,125
You knew about this
the whole time.

1025
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:27,661
Yeah. Frosty's no dummy,

1026
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:30,664
and my handwriting
is not that good.

1027
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:44,778
Happy birthday.

1028
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:17,644
Yes! Ha!

1029
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,418
Nice weather we're having,
eh, ladies?

1030
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,286
Hey. How's it going, Bob?

1031
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,721
How you holding up?

1032
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:29,857
Yeah, yeah. Good.

1033
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:32,359
This is Jay.

1034
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:34,595
Bob Pearson.
Heard a lot about you, kid.

1035
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:37,731
Thank you, sir.
Follow me.

1036
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:39,600
How's it cooking?
Catching any waves?

1037
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:41,468
No, I'll never surf anymore.

1038
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,804
I'm making too many boards
for all you guys.

1039
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:46,240
That's the way
I like to keep it.

1040
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,482
You want to slay a giant,
you need a sacred spear.

1041
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:58,552
Happy birthday, Jay.

1042
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,191
Can I...?

1043
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:05,692
Yeah. She's all yours.

1044
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:20,874
I don't know what to say.

1045
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:23,477
Just stay low, go fast.

1046
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:25,212
Yeah. Yeah.

1047
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:45,265
There. There he is.

1048
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:58,412
Yeah, he can take a beating.

1049
01:26:58,414 --> 01:27:00,647
But can he surf?

1050
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:02,416
Like nothing you've ever seen.

1051
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,554
You ever seen anyone that can
tread water like that

1052
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,556
for 45 minutes
without drowning?

1053
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:16,830
He's got a point.

1054
01:27:16,832 --> 01:27:19,666
Good, I'll take that
as two yeses.

1055
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:27,975
Just make sure he doesn't
drop in on me, all right?

1056
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:32,412
<i>Strong El

01:27:40,456 --> 01:27:42,823
<i>Large ocean swells</i>
<i>are expected to arrive</i>

1061
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:45,892
<i>resulting in large</i>
<i>breaking waves</i>

1062
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:48,595
<i>with heights to 35 feet.</i>

1063
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:57,471
Hey. It's pouring out there.

1064
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:02,943
How you been?

1065
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:05,746
Good.

1066
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:16,356
Kim, what's wrong?

1067
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,559
We've been friends forever.

1068
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:21,028
You don't have to do this.
Just tell me.

1069
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:24,364
It's just complicated.

1070
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:25,866
Not from where I'm sitting.

1071
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:30,337
That's because you only see
the good in everything.

1072
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:34,007
Most of us spend
all of our time

1073
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:36,576
dwelling on all the what ifs

1074
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:38,445
and just looking for
all the reasons

1075
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:40,814
why things
could never work out.

1076
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:42,516
And what if you're wrong?

1077
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:47,954
Then you show up
to a pizza parlor

1078
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:49,723
late one night, in the rain.

1079
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:58,365
Ever since we were
little kids, Jay,

1080
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:03,670
I've just had this feeling
deep down inside...

1081
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:06,940
...that you're the one,

1082
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:10,610
and I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with you.

1083
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:15,349
What?

1084
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:18,652
What's wrong?

1085
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:47,707
<i>Be advised,</i>

1086
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:49,509
<i>there is an extremely high</i>
<i>surf advisory in effect.</i>

1087
01:30:49,511 --> 01:30:51,945
<i>Buoys reporting</i>
<i>32 feet at 18 seconds.</i>

1088
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:57,651
Hey.

1089
01:30:57,653 --> 01:31:01,788
Hey, Frosty, I just heard,
32 at 18.

1090
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:04,858
Okay.

1091
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,793
Okay, I'll call Kim.

1092
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:15,168
Are you sure
you don't wanna come?

1093
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:18,672
I just want you to come home.

1094
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:24,945
You sure you got everything?

1095
01:31:24,947 --> 01:31:27,080
Yeah.

1096
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:30,984
All right, then.
Because of that,

1097
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:32,786
there'll be a lot of cowboys
out there today

1098
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:34,554
trying to prove themselves.

1099
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:36,890
Some of them
are gonna get hurt.

1100
01:31:36,892 --> 01:31:40,894
So keep your distance
and keep your focus, all right?

1101
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:51,671
So a swell with this much west

1102
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:53,206
means sets will be shifting.

1103
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:56,910
So you better be prepared.

1104
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:02,749
Pull over. Pull over.

1105
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,884
Let's keep you warm, okay?

1106
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,886
Okay.
All right.

1107
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,327
I'll catch up with you.

1108
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,830
Hey.
Hey.

1109
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:54,167
Coast looks pretty scary.

1110
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:56,703
Never seen it this big before.

1111
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:01,308
I've been thinking
about a lot of things lately.

1112
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:04,177
You taught me to surf.

1113
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:06,646
I never thanked you for that.

1114
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,116
I'll be watching you, man.

1115
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:25,599
End of an innocence,
my brother.

1116
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:32,305
How you feeling, kid?

1117
01:33:32,307 --> 01:33:34,140
You ready?

1118
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:36,910
Suit up.
We'll paddle out together.

1119
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,314
What about you, Frost?

1120
01:33:43,986 --> 01:33:46,953
I made a promise
a long time ago, chief.

1121
01:33:58,332 --> 01:34:00,867
That isn't El Niño, boys.

1122
01:34:00,869 --> 01:34:03,103
That's El Jefe right there.

1123
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:08,074
You gotta be kidding me.

1124
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,945
It's too big for the kid.

1125
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:23,156
Jay, are you sure about this?

1126
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:26,126
I mean, really, really sure?

1127
01:34:26,128 --> 01:34:27,694
Because I'm not.

1128
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:34,267
I am.

1129
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:51,084
I know what you're
gonna say, so don't.

1130
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:53,053
That wasn't the deal.

1131
01:34:53,055 --> 01:34:54,287
Remember?

1132
01:34:54,289 --> 01:34:56,756
No questions, no arguing.

1133
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:04,998
I just wanted to tell you
something

1134
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,133
I should've told you long ago.

1135
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:10,870
Which is, it doesn't matter.

1136
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:15,875
Whether you decide to
paddle out or take that drop,

1137
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:20,046
I love you no matter what.

1138
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:28,154
Frost.

1139
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,277
Come on.

1140
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:35,789
Hey, get us closer! Closer!

1141
01:36:57,444 --> 01:36:58,978
Let's do it!

1142
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,281
- Whoo!
- Go time!

1143
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:53,199
Ah...

1144
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,613
Get out of here!
Sets are shifting!

1145
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:10,183
Swing wide! Outside!

1146
01:38:10,185 --> 01:38:11,618
Kid, paddle, paddle, paddle!

1147
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:16,489
Go, go, go!

1148
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,610
Get your boats out of here now!

1149
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,953
Go, Jay, get out!

1150
01:38:46,955 --> 01:38:49,255
Paddle, paddle, paddle!

1151
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:05,204
Somebody's gonna die out there.

1152
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:06,526
He'll be okay,

1153
01:41:06,528 --> 01:41:08,528
as long as he can still
climb up the leash.

1154
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:57,677
Come on, Jay.

1155
01:42:10,591 --> 01:42:13,392
Come on, Jay.

1156
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:32,745
There he is!

1157
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:01,908
Grab ahold!

1158
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:05,311
No, no, no! Give me my board!

1159
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:09,682
You heard him!

1160
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:16,923
Thanks.

1161
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:24,664
Wait a minute.
What's he doing?

1162
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:34,941
He came to surf Mavericks.

1163
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:40,313
Set it up, man. Set it up.

1164
01:43:40,315 --> 01:43:42,215
- Take it.
- I got it.

1165
01:43:42,217 --> 01:43:43,416
Thanks.

1166
01:43:43,418 --> 01:43:45,418
Hold on, hold on.

1167
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,421
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1168
01:44:08,842 --> 01:44:11,711
Come on, man,
you don't have to surf it.

1169
01:44:11,713 --> 01:44:13,512
Came this far,
you at least need to feel it.

1170
01:44:13,514 --> 01:44:16,249
No.

1171
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:18,384
Think I've felt enough
for one day.

1172
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:26,726
Kill it.

1173
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:39,338
<i>Dear Frosty,</i>

1174
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:41,641
<i>Truth is that I am afraid.</i>

1175
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:43,476
<i>I'm afraid I'll never</i>
<i>see my dad again</i>

1176
01:44:43,478 --> 01:44:45,578
<i>and that my mom</i>
<i>will never find happiness.</i>

1177
01:44:47,014 --> 01:44:48,881
<i>I'm afraid of losing Kim</i>

1178
01:44:48,883 --> 01:44:51,384
<i>because she's the love</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

1179
01:44:51,386 --> 01:44:55,021
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>I'm afraid of losing you.</i>

1180
01:44:55,023 --> 01:44:57,490
<i>I'm not sure what you think</i>
<i>fathers are supposed to be,</i>

1181
01:44:57,492 --> 01:44:59,992
<i>but now I know</i>
<i>what they should be.</i>

1182
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:08,768
Glad to see you made it, kid.

1183
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:10,770
<i>I finally read my dad's letter,</i>

1184
01:45:10,772 --> 01:45:13,639
<i>which was like</i>
<i>my last essay to you.</i>

1185
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:14,974
<i>Just a bunch of words</i>
<i>on a page.</i>

1186
01:45:31,425 --> 01:45:33,092
This one's all you, charger.

1187
01:45:33,094 --> 01:45:35,061
<i>I know this sounds strange,</i>

1188
01:45:35,063 --> 01:45:36,762
<i>but I've always felt</i>

1189
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:38,698
<i>like I wouldn't be around</i>
<i>for very long,</i>

1190
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:41,434
<i>which is why</i>
<i>I want to take that drop.</i>

1191
01:45:41,436 --> 01:45:44,103
<i>Because once I look down</i>
<i>over the edge</i>

1192
01:45:44,105 --> 01:45:46,105
<i>and I catch it,</i>
<i>I'll become a part of it.</i>

1193
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:50,943
<i>And in that moment,</i>
<i>I'll know that I'm alive.</i>

1194
01:47:52,065 --> 01:47:53,933
<i>Jay became famous that day,</i>

1195
01:47:53,935 --> 01:47:55,868
<i>not for riding giants,</i>

1196
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:59,705
<i>but for the courage of a boy</i>
<i>who dared the impossible.</i>

1197
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:02,508
<i>Over the years, he rose to</i>
<i>the peak of the surfing world,</i>

1198
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:05,911
<i>his prowess matched</i>
<i>only by his joy.</i>

1199
01:48:05,913 --> 01:48:08,881
<i>The true prince</i>
<i>amidst a sport of kings.</i>

1200
01:48:08,883 --> 01:48:10,749
<i>He married</i>
<i>his childhood sweetheart</i>

1201
01:48:10,751 --> 01:48:12,818
<i>and swore himself true.</i>

1202
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:30,703
<i>As for the rest,</i>

1203
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:38,110
<i>all I will say is, the ones</i>
<i>who push the limits discover...</i>

1204
01:48:40,046 --> 01:48:43,048
<i>...the limits sometimes</i>
<i>push back.</i>

1205
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:28,160
To Jay!

1206
01:49:35,302 --> 01:49:37,703
To Jay!

1207
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:42,174
To Jay!

1208
01:49:42,176 --> 01:49:44,610
Yeah!

1209
01:49:57,924 --> 01:50:00,059
<i>We all come from the sea,</i>

1210
01:50:00,061 --> 01:50:03,195
<i>but we're not all of the sea.</i>

1211
01:50:03,197 --> 01:50:06,865
<i>Those of us who are,</i>
<i>we children of the tides,</i>

1212
01:50:06,867 --> 01:50:10,636
<i>must return to it</i>
<i>again and again</i>

1213
01:50:10,638 --> 01:50:12,871
<i>until the day</i>
<i>we don't come back,</i>

1214
01:50:12,873 --> 01:50:14,707
<i>leaving behind only that</i>

1215
01:50:14,709 --> 01:50:18,344
<i>which was touched</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

1216
01:50:18,346 --> 01:50:20,613
<i>You just got to
appreciate everything.</i>

1217
01:50:20,615 --> 01:50:24,216
Um, I think that's one
of the most important things

1218
01:50:24,218 --> 01:50:26,685
in life,
is just really appreciating it.

1219
01:50:26,687 --> 01:50:29,788
Because, you know,
we only get to do this once.

1220
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:34,326
And it's not for a long time,
so enjoy it.

1221
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:36,695
Yeah.
