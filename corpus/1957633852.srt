(ship humming)

16
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,999
- Hey! Hey there, mister.

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,724
Do you have something to
help out an old war veteran?

18
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:49,119
- Are you crazy, old man?

19
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,109
- Jeez, I'm just asking
for change. Anything that-

20
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,369
- Just stay away from
me, you insane freak!

21
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,370
- Wait!

22
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,298
I'm not the one who's crazy.

23
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,966
(ominous music)

00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:08,154

00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:13,469
- [Driver] Oh my! Are you okay?

26
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,729
My name is Angie. Please, let me help you.

27
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,769
- You gotta get me outta here, please.

28
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,620
Just get me away.

29
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:20,070

(John panting)

31
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,149
- Go, go! Get me home!

32
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,949
- [Angie] But we need to
get you fixed up first.

33
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,810
You need to heal.

34
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,969
- Look, lady, just drive! Please!

35
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,346
- [Angie] I really don't know
why we don't just sit here

36
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,739
and figure things out.

37
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,528
- Just go, go! Fucking go!

38
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,372
(tires screech)
Go!

39
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,663
(engine revs)

40
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:49,562
You need to get me home, please!

41
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,269
I don't know. Maybe the police!

42
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,547
I was tortured!

43
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:55,165
- What?

44
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,449
- I don't know. In some lab.

45
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,467
There were these strange creatures

46
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:02,403
and people with things that...

47
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,981
They did things to me.

48
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:07,391
- But why?
- I don't know.

49
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,209
I don't know!

50
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,082
(ship screeches)

51
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,741
Oh god, no!

52
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:14,439
- What? What is it?

53
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,404
- Look, don't you see?
That UFO, that ship!

54
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,801
They want me! They're after me!

55
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:20,802
- Want you?

56
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,366
(ominous music)

57
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:29,244
- Faster! Faster!

58
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,167
- You should calm down.

59
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:34,309

(coughs) Help me.

63
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:55,484
Help me, I'm stuck!

64
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:58,152
(both coughing)

65
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,965
Please. Please, my legs, they're stuck.

66
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:06,545
Please help me. (coughs)

67
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:08,380
Help me, I'm stuck.

68
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:11,048
(both coughing)

69
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,507
Wait!

70
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,591
John! Please!

71
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:17,821
Wait! No!

(ominous music)

78
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,986

79
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:55,987
Please, no!

80
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,041
No, please! I don't want to go back!

I don't want to go back! Please!

00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,932
No, please! Please don't
take me back there!

84
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,460
Please, I don't want to go back!

85
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,199
Please, no!

86
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,548
Oh no!

(ominous music)

113
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,671
It's 3:50. You in?

114
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:37,859
- [Man] I'm still not sure.

115
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,359
I mean, it's an awful lot of money.

116
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,779
- Come on, you can trust me.

117
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,849
I'm telling you, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime deal.

118
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,319
- [Man] Well, I just...

119
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,499
I don't know. It's a lot to gamble with.

120
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,489
- Hey, I'm a man of my word.

121
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,359
- [Man] Now, you're sure
about this stock, right?

122
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,909
- Sure, sure, of course
I'm sure. Listen to me.

123
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,932
I have got the best
planes in the business,

124
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:01,039
and trust me, I am not
in this for the money.

125
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
You understand?

126
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,733
- [Man] Well, I know, but-

127
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,579
- Look, I promise you,

128
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,009
I don't have a greedy
brain cell in my head.

129
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,301
You can look if you like.

130
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:13,279
- [Man] All right, all right,
I'm sorry. Sure, go ahead.

131
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,180
I'll wire the money to you right away.

132
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,900
- You won't regret it.

133
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,689
Hey, Mary, how are you?

134
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,256
- [Mary] Hi, John, I'm doing
fine. What can I do for you?

135
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:29,271
- Yeah, listen. Can you
verify a wire deposit for me?

136
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:31,339
- [Mary] Sure thing. Let me check.

137
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,279
Yep, you've been approved
for a $40,000 transfer

138
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,629
from the Better Times Orphanage.

139
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,570
- Great. Thanks, Mary.

140
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:39,925
- [Mary] Sounds like you
made a good deal here today.

141
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,999
You know, John, you're
a real smart cookie.

142
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,930
- Yeah, it's all in how you use

143
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:44,673
the brain in your head, sweetheart.

144
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,083
You are too smooth, John. (chuckles)

145
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:52,973
Too smooth.

146
00:13:54,377 --> 00:13:56,627
God, I should be president.

147
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:03,896
(sinister music)

148
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,343
(John screams)

149
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:18,133

150
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:22,878
(John coughs)

151
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,399

152
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,853
(alien speaking strange language)

153
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:33,826
(John gasping)

154
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:38,827
Please! Please, let me go! (panting)

155
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,496
Please stop! I can pay
you whatever you want!

156
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:53,861
(John groaning)

157
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:59,805
(John shouts)

158
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:08,021
(beam humming)
(John screams)

159
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,119
- You could have been honest.
You could have tried more!

160
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,472
I spent five years loving you.

161
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:21,089
- And you could've been a real woman,

162
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,899
given me what I deserve!

163
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,843
- After half a decade of
marriage, that's all you can say?

164
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,729
What was it you deserved, John?

165
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,799
What was it that you didn't get?

166
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,339
I loved you!

167
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,599
I gave you all that I had!

168
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,933
My soul, my heart,

169
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,296
and this is how you repay me?

170
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:42,179
- Shit, get the fuck out, bitch.

171
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,646
- [Wife] Is that what you've come to?

172
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,572
- You know, I'm so sick
and tired of hearing

173
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:47,909
what the fuck you want!

174
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,929
- It's not what I want,
John! It's what we want.

175
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,016
It's what we both want.

176
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,639
- There is no "we" anymore, all right?

177
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,259
- Is that it?

178
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,711
You can just turn us off,
just like that, so easily?

179
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,159
- Yeah, whatever.

180
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,399
- How could you? How
could you do it, John?

181
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,889
- Look, it's over, all
right? You had your chance!

182
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,859
- My chance?

183
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,409
It was my sister, John.

184
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,639
It was my sister you slept with.

185
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,789
And now you have her
pregnant and hating me.

186
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,913
How did you manage to do it? (sobs)

187
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,929
(John sighs)

188
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,752
- None of us are angels, sweetheart.

189
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:37,249
I never said I was.

190
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,969
- Then you can be a solitary devil.

191
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,883
You cut out my heart, you
bastard! Goodbye, John.

192
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,922
- Yeah, later.

193
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,149

199
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,932
(John grunts)

200
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,073
What is this?

201
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,128
What'd I do?

202
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:25,680
(gunshots crack)

203
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,348
I don't want to die.

204
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:30,905
Why is this happening to me?

205
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:33,499
Wait!

206
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,089
Wait, come back! Please!

207
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,552
Wait! (groans)

208
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:39,949
I'm sorry!

209
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,450
Come back, please!

210
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,867
Wait!

211
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:47,670
Why is this happening to me?

212
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:48,838
Ah! Come back!

213
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:53,109

Who are you?

228
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:08,492
Why are you doing this to me?

229
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:16,357
Are you drugging me?

230
00:21:17,746 --> 00:21:19,329
Am I hallucinating?

231
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:23,754
Is that it?

232
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,258
Yeah, that's it.

233
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,916
It's just a bad trip.

234
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:39,093
You're not real.
(chuckles) You're not real.

235
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:41,845
You're not real!

236
00:21:52,231 --> 00:21:53,814
What are you doing?

237
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,250
What are you doing?

238
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:01,173
Ah! What are you doing?

- You going out?
- Yeah, how much?

255
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,820
- I like it. You a cop?

256
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:49,492
- A fuckin' cop? Do I look
like a fuckin' cop to you?

257
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:51,019
- No, but you look like you're gonna have

258
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,352
a good time tonight.

259
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:55,357

(sinister music)

261
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,029
- The rough stuff's gonna
cost you extra. Slut cash.

262
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,843
- Nice, naughty, who the
fuck are you to judge me?

263
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,493
- Hey, no! Stop!

264

341
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,983

- What the-

360
00:38:48,146 --> 00:38:49,282

- No, no, no!

362
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,152

No need to go crazy. I just
want to give you another chance.

372
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:14,479
- What the fuck are you talking about?

373
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,919
- Don't throw this all away now.

374
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,189
We can cut a deal, okay? We're
out for some information.

375
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,969
- Help you? The fuck you want my help for?

376
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,399
- We're not looking for you,
okay? We want your supplier.

377
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,516
- No, you wait and you listen to me, man.

378
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:28,409
I'm getting my shit and I'm
getting the fuck outta here!

379
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,429
Got it?

380
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,979
- Look, don't throw this all away.

381
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,739
This is your chance. Don't give this up.

382
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,719
Don't throw away your
chance to go straight.

383
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,873
There's no need to get like...

384
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,681
(gunshots crack)

385
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:42,349
(ominous music)

386
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,209
Station, this is Agent Tucker.

387
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,527
I got a suspect down, need some
assistance. I think he's...

388
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:03,227
(energy warbling)

389
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:13,494
(creatures chittering)

390
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:22,645
(energy warbling)

391
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:27,781
(ominous music)

392
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:42,778
(tense music)

393
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:55,388
- Hey.

394
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:56,646
Hey.
- No!

395
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,119
- [John] Are you all right?

396
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,659
- No. Please don't hurt me!

397
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,620
- You...

398
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:02,623
You speak English?

399
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,409
What are you doing here?
- Are you with them?

400
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,229
- Who? No.

401
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,369
No, I don't know how I got here.

402
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,389
- I can't take this!

403
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,609
Help me, God! Help me!

404
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,469
- Shut up! Shut up!

405
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,119
Or we get caught. I'm
not going back there.

406
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,423
- How did you get here?

407
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,509
- I don't remember. I was running.

408
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,529
- You are marked.
- What?

409
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,089
- You have the mark.

410
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,419
- What mark?
- I'm not marked.

411
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,679
I'm going to leave.

412
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,109
- What the fuck are you talking about?

413
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,293
- I'm sorry. I will pray
for you. (screeches)

414
00:41:35,294 --> 00:41:38,044
(sinister music)

415
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,399
- You motherfucker.

416
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,864
Get away from me. Stay away from me!

417
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:48,865
(suspenseful music)

418
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:04,621
(John shouting)

419
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:11,126
Who are you?

420
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:17,189
(alien hisses)

421
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,729
- It's all right. Don't struggle.

422
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,270
Punished children always
correct themselves.

423
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:29,472
You'll have your chance again.

424
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:41,854
♪ My eyes have seen the glory

425
00:42:42,842 --> 00:42:46,584

00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:47,668

(energy humming)

432
00:43:09,537 --> 00:43:14,537
Who are you?

433
00:43:14,911 --> 00:43:17,366
What are you doing? No!

434
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:18,827
No!

435
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:19,828
No!

436
00:43:21,158 --> 00:43:22,158
No!

437
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:24,169
No!

438
00:43:25,596 --> 00:43:29,444
(ominous music)
(heartbeat thumping)

439
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:30,535
No! No!

440
00:43:30,536 --> 00:43:33,204
What are you doing? No!

441
00:43:33,205 --> 00:43:34,205
No!

442
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:38,295
Who are you?

443
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:41,049
- I am the Preparer.

444
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,549
- Preparer for what?

445
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,019
- For what comes next.

446
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,839
I am the preparer for the
transition from life to death.

447
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,269
- What are you talking about?

448
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,619
- This is a house of preparation.

449
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,789
- Preparation for what?

450
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,762
I never seen you before. I never hurt you!

451
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:59,259
- I do not pass judgment.
That is reserved for others.

452
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,279
- Let me go. This is ridiculous.

453
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,630
I never did anything wrong!

454
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,619
- You're not the first to have said that.

455
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,389
If that were the case, they
would not have been here.

456
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,893
Tell me what makes you so
sure of your innocence.

457
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,399
- All right. I've been thinking, okay?

458
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,723
I've been remembering things.

459
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,798
- Then maybe you are ready.

460
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:24,633
- (sobs) Yes. Yes.

461
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,683
I never killed anyone.

462
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,499
I was always nice to friends.

463
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,500
- But those are the actions

464
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:35,129
even the most evil of men have taken.

465
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,233
- No, no. I've always been nice to people.

466
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,850
- Have you ever helped
the most needy among you?

467
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,979
- I'm sure. I mean, of course I did.

468
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,273
I did plenty of times.

469
00:44:49,274 --> 00:44:51,966
(energy thrumming)

470
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:54,967
(whistle screeches)

471
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,503
No, wait. Look.

472
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:01,349
There were some people, okay?

473
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:05,326
I mean, how's a guy
supposed to make a living?

474
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,203
There are just some people

475
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,509
that are more aggressive as others.

476
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,210
How are you supposed to get ahead?

477
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,853
- No, you have not.

478
00:45:12,854 --> 00:45:15,943
And you have stepped on
those who are truly needy.

479
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,139
The offending part must be removed.

480
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,089
Preparation for cleansing, you understand.

481
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,833
- Why? What are you doing to me?

482
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,620
What are you doing?

483
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,394
No!

484
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,100
No!

485
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,809
- Your suffering will make you worthy.

486
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:36,810
- No!

487
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,027
No!
- Offer your suffering.

488
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:42,869
Then this.
- No!

489
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,870
No!

490
00:45:45,852 --> 00:45:46,852
No!

491
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:51,726
(shouting) No!

492
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,980
- [Preparer] This...

493
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,900
This is suffering.

494
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,724
It's not the momentary
pain that our lives feel

495
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:24,225
from time to time.

496
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:28,256
It's not the fateful wounds. They heal.

497
00:46:28,257 --> 00:46:32,193
But true suffering, it's repetition.

498
00:46:32,194 --> 00:46:33,969
The ability to then escape the loop

499
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,109
that we put ourselves into.

500
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:40,837
That's when you realize you
have to fight. Or give up.

501
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:43,088
I can't fight. Not anymore.

502
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:47,788
I fought my whole life, but now? (laughs)

503
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:49,876
What's the point?

504
00:46:49,877 --> 00:46:52,388
Point of raising my head?

505
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:56,556
Point of raising my gold
and my legions of lovers?

506
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:02,879
(brooding music)

507
00:47:28,827 --> 00:47:31,994
(children chattering)

508
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:37,131
- Hello?

509
00:47:37,132 --> 00:47:40,299
(children chattering)

510
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:48,015
(children chattering)

511
00:47:56,363 --> 00:48:00,363
(cacophonous voices chattering)

512
00:48:08,976 --> 00:48:11,620
(John groans)

513
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:14,371
(chilling music)

514
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:34,886
(eerie music)

515
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,439
- Don't worry. Your
time here will be short.

516
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,149
And if you pass judgment,

517
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,559
your salvation will be for eternity.

518
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,449
However, if you fail,

519
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,403
they tell me your suffering
will be most difficult.

520
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,179
- Why are you doing this to me?

521
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,186
- We do what we are made to do.

522
00:49:05,187 --> 00:49:06,673
- Please!

523
00:49:06,674 --> 00:49:07,816
Let me go home!

524
00:49:07,817 --> 00:49:09,979
- You do not really want freedom.

525
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,788
You are much safer here until we are done.

526
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:15,496
- No! No, I want to leave!

527
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:16,619
I want to go!

528
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,709
- What lies ahead after is up to you.

529
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,263
It is not up to you to go.

530
00:49:23,649 --> 00:49:24,682
- Where am I?

531
00:49:24,683 --> 00:49:26,833
- Tartarus is a place of preparation.

532
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,819
You've had a lifetime of actions.

533
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,609
Now you will have that
chance to remember them all.

534
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,458
It is my job to ensure
you know what they were.

535
00:49:35,459 --> 00:49:39,272
- No, no, no, lies! All of it are lies!

536
00:49:39,273 --> 00:49:41,589
- Your time of redemption is at hand.

537
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,819
- No!

538
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,163
No. Let me go!

539
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,996
- Some people never escape
their cycle. You are not ready.

540
00:49:48,997 --> 00:49:50,023
- No! No, wait!

541
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:55,439
Come back! Maybe we can make a deal!

542
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,487
I can get you anything you want!

543
00:49:57,488 --> 00:50:00,563
Please! Must be something you want!

544
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,231
(pensive music)

545
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:16,029
(widow sobbing)

546
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:27,436
(John sighs)

547
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,280
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to cry.

548
00:50:35,281 --> 00:50:39,349
- It's all right, I understand.
You loved him very much.

549
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,729
- He was such a good
man. Oh, how he prayed.

550
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,580
Oh, how he prayed.

551
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:46,559
- But that underscores what I'm saying.

552
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,789
You want his afterlife to be
safe and peaceful, don't you?

553
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,979
- Oh, yes!

554
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,889
- Well, then let me help you.

555
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,440
Let us both help your dearly
departed husband Dave.

556
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,159
- Oh, what can you do?

557
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,289
- Just buy this video.

558
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,339
It will tell you all you need to know.

559
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,669
- I'm not sure.

560
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:05,083
- Look, it's only $50.

561
00:51:06,509 --> 00:51:08,269
It will tell you what
prayers you need to do

562
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,959
to help keep your husband safe.

563
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,309
- Oh. But I don't understand.

564
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,663
- You see, these aliens, these UFOs,

565
00:51:17,114 --> 00:51:19,620
they take people away, torture them.

566
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,359
They keep their souls.

567
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,719
The only way we can prevent that

568
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,339
is if we pray, and pray hard.

569
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,659
- But I do pray.

570
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,322
- Yeah, but not like what you think.

571
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:32,069
It's not just prayer.

572
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,069
It's a method to keep them away,

573
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,319
keep the UFOs and aliens
away from returning for you.

574
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,912
That way both you and your
husband's souls will be safe.

575
00:51:40,913 --> 00:51:43,319
And these videos will show you how.

576
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
- I don't know.

577
00:51:45,323 --> 00:51:48,949
- (sighs) Trust me. I have
seen these alien ships.

578
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,279
I know what these aliens look like.

579
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,469
- You've seen inside the ships?

580
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,469
- Oh, no. Only those captured
and tortured see in them.

581
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,619
But my video will show you
what these ships look like.

582
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,399
How to avoid them.

583
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,929
You will learn about the
evil things they do to you,

584
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,199
the horrors that they take on you.

585
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,629
Don't let this happen to you.

586
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,889
Don't let this happen to
your dear departed Dave!

587
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,890
- It's only $50?

588
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,189
- That's right.

589
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,009
And then you can subscribe to the club

590
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,839
and I can send you new
updates as they come out.

591
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,043
- Oh, all right.

592
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,769
I'm putting my trust in you.

593
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:27,344
- You have no reason not to.

594
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:30,095
(haunting music)

595
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,715
I thought I had time.

596
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:42,253
I mean, I was just doing
what everyone else was.

597
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:47,006
No harm there, right?
I was just being human.

598
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:50,366
I was just doing what I
could and when I could.

599
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,504
It wasn't like I had evil in my heart.

600
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:55,172
(John whimpers)

601
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:59,599
(John bawling)

602
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,329
Sure, I flicked off a
few people while driving.

603
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:10,649
I got mad. Who doesn't?

604
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,893
But what? Who could've
thought the roads end here?

605
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,489
I mean, hell is just a fairy tale, right?

606
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,659
I mean, you're told this
stuff when you're young,

607
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,819
impressionable, when there's a
chance to take your innocence

608
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,389
and use it for the good of the church

609
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,949
or religions or mankind, right?

610
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,959
I mean, who as an adult
searched the internet

611
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,310
and thinks about damnation?

612
00:53:32,832 --> 00:53:34,809
(John laughs madly)

613
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,699
That's just not part of
our intellectual makeup.

614
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,011
At least not mine, or even my friends'.

615
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:42,822
So I'm not going to fear the unknown,

616
00:53:42,823 --> 00:53:44,269
that strange, shadowy boogeyman

617
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:45,829
that hid in my closet in my youth.

618
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:46,909
I'm not going to run in fear

619
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,679
from all the harm people did to me.

620
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,079
I'm going to get back, get back at them

621
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,459
by rising above and
taking every chance I get,

622
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,599
get what I want, get what
I deserved for so long.

623
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,849
I mean, there will always be a chance

624
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,423
when I finally made it, with
money, friends, some rides.

625
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,993
I could always help my
buds out then, right?

626
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:08,923
There would always be time.

627
00:54:10,654 --> 00:54:11,654
Always.

628
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:19,631
(energy thrumming)

629
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,993
(machinery whirring)

630
00:54:36,393 --> 00:54:39,560
(eerie groan echoing)

631
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:02,578
(sinister music)

632
00:55:18,847 --> 00:55:21,597
(haunting music)

633
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:55,941
(chilling music)

634
00:55:57,885 --> 00:55:58,885
Hey.

635
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,620
Hey, old man!

636
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,303
Hey! I'm talking to you!

637
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,220
Hey!

638
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,143
What are you doing here?

639
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,089
- I'm raking leaves.

640
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:16,170
- I can see that. I mean...

641
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,883
What are you doing in this place?

642
00:56:23,775 --> 00:56:26,525
(haunting music)

643
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:32,475
You!

644
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,380
- Yes?

645
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:34,449
- You're that one...

646
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,453
The costume, the mask! You!

647
00:56:36,454 --> 00:56:38,279
You! You're that one!

648
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,009
- We all wear masks, don't we, John?

649
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,010
- What?

650
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,369
- I suppose nobody's explained
this to you yet, have they?

651
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:46,553
- What? No!

652
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:50,703
- Come with me.
- Hey, I'm not going! Ah!

653
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:55,679
- What's the matter?

654
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,379
Does it look to you like
an old man with a rake

655
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,719
can do you any harm?

656
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,430
- No, but I...

657
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,839
- I understand you've
been quite busy lately.

658
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,299
- Look, I don't mean any disrespect,

659
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,169
but I have no idea what
you're talking about.

660
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:13,249
- I suppose some things do
need to be spoonfed to you.

661
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,170
You do know where you are, don't you?

662
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,999
- Tartarus.
- Ah!

663
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,579
Good. So you've gotten
something after all these years.

664
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,479
- Years?
- Of course.

665
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,732
Didn't you think that table fit you

666
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:28,483
just a little too comfortably?

667
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,405
- The table?

668
00:57:33,906 --> 00:57:35,029
But what does that have to do with-

669
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,169
- Custom-fit, custom-made.

670
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,879
And let me tell, we've
had a lot of practice

671
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,049
working on them over all these years.

672
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:42,899
Come on, you don't think those minerals

673
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,879
have collected there by
accident or by themselves

674
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,063
over all this time?

675
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,079
Your body regenerates the materials, John,

676
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,809
keeps dropping them.

677
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,528
It's a part of you.

678
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:56,529
(John laughs madly)

679
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,909
Absurd? Crazy?

680
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,760
Not really sure what's going on, huh?

681
00:58:04,445 --> 00:58:07,473
- I don't know. This is all so strange.

682
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,323
Yet-
- Somewhat familiar.

683
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,089
We get that a lot here.

684
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,609
You can't have everyone
experiencing the same lives.

685
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:19,419
It doesn't make any sense,
and it defeats the purpose.

686
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,881
- You gonna tell me that
there's a reason for all this?

687
00:58:21,882 --> 00:58:23,412
- Yes, and a good one.

688
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:26,139
- (laughs) Now this I gotta hear.

689
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:29,311
- Always a downer you were,
John. Always a downer.

690
00:58:29,312 --> 00:58:31,449
- And let me guess: now you're gonna say

691
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,159
that you knew me my whole life, right?

692
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,609
- You know, I would show
you a smile in appreciation,

693
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,617
but I doubt you're being
anything but sarcastic.

694
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:39,477
- I have a right to be!

695
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:41,179
You have no idea what I was going through!

696
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,697
- [Preparer] I wouldn't use past tense.

697
00:58:43,698 --> 00:58:47,299
- Oh man. This is come
kind of fucked-up dream!

698
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,309
- You've been down this
path many, many times, John.

699
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,971
You'd think dying would change people.

700
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:54,089
- What?

701
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:56,599
- You've been in Tartarus
for several years, John.

702
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,759
There's only one reason for that.

703
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,760
- Years?

704
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,546
That can't be.

705
00:59:02,547 --> 00:59:04,169
- You're going to be approaching a record

706
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,999
within a few more years as well.

707
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,529
And that's a hard thing to accomplish.

708
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,079
- This isn't some kind of sport.

709
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,939
You're messing in my
mind. This is my body!

710
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,399
- Not really.

711
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,579
It's your life, to be sure,

712
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,319
but your mind, your goals, your essence,

713
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,779
are no longer really your own.

714
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,099
- The hell it ain't!
- Well, then show us.

715
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,409
- Show you what?

716
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:28,219
- Prove to us that you
still have some control.

717
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,333
- I am in control. I'm doing what I want.

718
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
- Then let's see.

719
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
See that?

720
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,090
- How can you be here...

721
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,469
And there?

722
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,309
- Bilocation? Simple trick.

723
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:47,027
You're missing the point.

724
00:59:47,028 --> 00:59:51,111
- And that would be?

725
00:59:51,112 --> 00:59:53,159
- He needs help.

726
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,857
- But you're right here!

727
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:56,603
- Am I? Then who's that?

728
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:00,362
- I don't know, and I don't care!

729
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:02,313
I just want to get the fuck outta here!

730
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,149
- But that man over there, he needs you!

731
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,257
- Then you help him.

732
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,899
- That's not the lesson.

733
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,949
You must ask yourself why you have arrived

734
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,550
at this station in your journey.

735
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:19,887
- There is no journey!
If I'm dead, I'm dead!

736
01:00:19,888 --> 01:00:21,209
(preparer sighs)

737
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:25,339
- Precisely, so this is what
you are. This is who you are.

738
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,689
Don't you see, John?

739
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,409
You're repeating these events,

740
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,149
not for the sake of the evil in you,

741
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,763
but for one purpose only: redemption.

742
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,293
- I don't need redemption!

743
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:39,160
- We have been trying to
teach you, trying to show you.

744
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:41,543
- No! No!

745
01:00:42,442 --> 01:00:43,792
- He needs your help, John.

746
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,039
- He can fend for himself!

747
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,703
- Are you so sure? Within
minutes he could be dead.

748
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,499
- Better him than me!

749
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,252
I'm not getting any more pain in my life.

750
01:00:55,253 --> 01:00:57,363
- Pain is part of all learning and growth.

751
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,597
It is how we evolve, or ascend.

752
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,289
- No way! You have powers, you save him!

753
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,440
I'm getting outta here.

754
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,639
- You are going nowhere.

755
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,640
- What did you say?

756
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:14,298
(haunting music)

757
01:01:17,204 --> 01:01:19,954
(John screaming)

758
01:01:21,604 --> 01:01:22,604
Let me go!

759
01:01:23,293 --> 01:01:24,460
No! Not again!

760
01:01:25,955 --> 01:01:26,955
No!

761
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:28,675
Ah!

762
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:30,358
No!

763
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:32,800
No! Let me go!

764
01:01:34,685 --> 01:01:36,462
- What did you see as a child?

765
01:01:36,463 --> 01:01:37,463
- What?

766
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,619
- We must take you back.
What did you see as a child?

767
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,263
What were in those child's eyes?

768
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:49,879
- Daddy.

769
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:53,436
Daddy.

770
01:01:53,437 --> 01:01:56,020
(John sobbing)

771
01:01:58,025 --> 01:02:00,244
Daddy.

772
01:02:00,245 --> 01:02:05,245
Daddy?

773
01:02:05,985 --> 01:02:08,735
(menacing music)

774
01:02:11,524 --> 01:02:14,191
(John whimpers)

775
01:02:28,952 --> 01:02:31,702
- You have some explaining to do.

776
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:35,633
Didn't you hear me? Huh?

777
01:02:36,856 --> 01:02:37,856
- Daddy.

778
01:02:40,717 --> 01:02:41,800
Daddy, can...

779
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,497
- Not much for words?

780
01:02:49,968 --> 01:02:51,465
You're just like your old lady.

781
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:53,924
- Can I go with Mommy tonight?

782
01:02:53,925 --> 01:02:55,415
- What?

783
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:56,666
What'd you say?

784
01:02:57,576 --> 01:02:58,576
- Please?

785
01:03:00,305 --> 01:03:02,305
- Go with Mommy tonight?

786
01:03:04,374 --> 01:03:05,780
- I...

787
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,620
I wanna be with Mommy!

788
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:08,457
- Maybe you don't realize it,

789
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:10,183
but your mommy isn't here tonight!

790
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,889
(John bawls)

791
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:14,883
Oh, for crying out loud!

792
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,069
Well, you're here, and you're
gonna shut the fuck up, okay?

793
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,160
That's it!

794
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:22,161
- I wanna be with Mommy!

795
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,849
- You're mother's out
there whoring around,

796
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,269
getting pumped full of drugs!

797
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,234
Is that what you wanna be?

798
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:29,235
- Uh-huh!

799
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:32,881
- Well, I say you can't.

800
01:03:32,882 --> 01:03:34,264
- Please.

801
01:03:34,265 --> 01:03:37,189
(ominous music)

802
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,190
No, Daddy, no!

803
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,656
No, Daddy! They'll come for you!

804
01:03:50,657 --> 01:03:51,657
- What?

805
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:53,747
Who will?

806
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:57,590
- The mirror men.

807
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,959
- What are you saying? Boy,
if you're playing with me...

808
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,513
- The mirror men told
me to tell you to stop.

809
01:04:05,797 --> 01:04:08,959
Or they will take you away and keep you.

810
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,247
- Mirror men? (scoffs)

811
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,293
You have some imagination.

812
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,813
- They want you.

813
01:04:30,184 --> 01:04:31,184
I told you.

814
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,766
- See?

815
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:40,533
It's just a mirror, kid.

816
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:45,096
- Mirror men, mirror men,
mirror men, mirror men...

817
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:52,729
- What are you doing to me? You're evil.

818
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:55,226
Your mother is evil and she put it in you!

819
01:04:55,227 --> 01:04:58,779
You're an evil child and
you should be punished!

820
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,503
- It's you who should be punished.

821
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:04,759
They're here. They've come for you.

822
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,139
- Don't talk to your father like that!

823
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,890
(bones rattling)

824
01:05:11,129 --> 01:05:14,048
- Mirror men, mirror men, mirror men.

825
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:17,593
Mirror men, mirror men, mirror men.

826
01:05:17,594 --> 01:05:20,986
Mirror men, mirror men,
mirror men, mirror men.

827
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:24,139
Mirror men, mirror men, mirror men.

828
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,403
I told you.

829
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,923
They want to take you
away for what you've done.

830
01:05:29,924 --> 01:05:32,700
(father gasping)

831
01:05:32,701 --> 01:05:35,451
(bones rattling)

832
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,401
Mirror men, mirror men,
mirror men, mirror men!

833
01:05:42,402 --> 01:05:45,152
(father gasping)

834
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,512
He's coming.

835
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:52,670
He coming, and when he
does, you won't get away.

836
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,633
Don't struggle, Daddy, he
won't hurt you. Not for long.

837
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:22,028
(sinister music)

838
01:06:48,652 --> 01:06:51,152
(eerie music)

839
01:07:22,345 --> 01:07:25,095
(chilling music)

840
01:07:41,418 --> 01:07:42,668
Goodbye, Daddy.

841
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:47,913
Goodbye, Daddy.

842
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:57,501
Goodbye, Daddy.

843
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:02,927
Goodbye, Daddy.

844
01:08:02,928 --> 01:08:05,886
(ominous music)

845
01:08:05,887 --> 01:08:08,720
(thunder rumbles)

846
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,183
(John sobbing)

847
01:08:22,006 --> 01:08:23,006
I...

848
01:08:23,927 --> 01:08:26,239
I understand now.

849
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,883
- I knew in time you would.

850
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:34,119
- I don't know why you
just didn't tell me.

851
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,219
- How can you explain to the seed

852
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,009
that is to be placed in
the cold, dark ground

853
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:40,899
that one day it would sprout
into a beautiful flower?

854
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,819
Would it believe? I think not.

855
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,413
- Please, let me go now.

856
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,150
- You're readiness is on your soul.

857
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:06,771
(pensive music)

858
01:09:18,664 --> 01:09:21,747
(heartbeat thumping)

859
01:09:34,924 --> 01:09:37,094
Stop! You don't know what you're doing!

860
01:09:37,095 --> 01:09:38,759
- You bastard! You ruined my life!

861
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,599
- No, you don't understand!

862
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,942
This is all a part of God's way!

863
01:09:43,943 --> 01:09:44,943
- Shut up!

864
01:09:46,452 --> 01:09:47,785
There is no god!

865
01:09:51,431 --> 01:09:54,181
(chilling music)

866
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:24,957
No!

867
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,291
No, you bastard!

868
01:10:29,652 --> 01:10:32,891
(John shouts)

869
01:10:32,892 --> 01:10:35,309
(John weeps)

870
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,317
(John bawls)

871
01:10:46,601 --> 01:10:47,601
You bastard!

872
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:54,895
(machinery chugging)

873
01:11:02,618 --> 01:11:05,285
(ominous music)

874
01:11:31,283 --> 01:11:33,533
- Help me, please! Help me!

875
01:11:35,976 --> 01:11:37,099
Before they come back! Hurry!

876
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,736
- He won't be coming back. I killed him.

877
01:11:40,737 --> 01:11:42,009
(captive laughs)

878
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,619
What's so funny?

879
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,473
What's so funny?

880
01:11:46,474 --> 01:11:49,409
- You can't kill an Eternal!

881
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:51,210
Hurry! There's a key on the wall.

882
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:54,469
If you hurry, you can save
us both! There's time!

883
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:55,697
- No! No!
- Hurry.

884
01:11:55,698 --> 01:11:56,920
- You're one of them too!

885
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:58,070
- No! No.

886
01:11:58,071 --> 01:11:59,409
- No!

887
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,839
- Wait! Please, no.

888
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,066
This is the last chance.
We can help each other.

889
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:04,067
- No! No!

890
01:12:11,682 --> 01:12:14,571
(electricity crackles)

891
01:12:14,572 --> 01:12:17,155
(John screams)

892
01:12:20,023 --> 01:12:23,190
(John laughing madly)

893
01:12:51,709 --> 01:12:54,126
(John bawls)

894
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,406
(John laughing)

895
01:13:10,438 --> 01:13:15,438
(suspenseful music)
(ship warbling)

896
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:28,729
(tense music)

897
01:13:47,155 --> 01:13:49,822
(tires screech)

898
01:13:58,884 --> 01:14:02,074
Help me! Help me, please, help me!

899
01:14:02,075 --> 01:14:06,442
You gotta take me away.
I was being tortured!

900
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:07,443
- Uh, okay.

901
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,163
Um, you don't look very good.

902
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:15,009
- I've been through hell.

903
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,510
- You look like you've been through a lot.

904
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,923
All right, where to?

905
01:14:24,124 --> 01:14:26,882
- I don't care. Just take me away, please.

906
01:14:26,883 --> 01:14:28,610
To a hospital, I don't care.

907
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:30,793
- Okay.
- Just take me away.

908
01:14:30,794 --> 01:14:33,461
- Okay. So what happened to you?

909
01:14:34,342 --> 01:14:37,523
- Please, please just take
me home. Take me away.

910
01:14:37,524 --> 01:14:39,192
Take me to a hospital, I don't care.

911
01:14:39,193 --> 01:14:40,427
Just please.
- Okay, okay.

912
01:14:40,428 --> 01:14:42,117
- Please just take me away.

913
01:14:42,118 --> 01:14:45,429
- Okay, but you know,
some people say that hell

914
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:47,780
is just a place that you
can never escape from.

915
01:14:48,653 --> 01:14:52,269
- Bitch, you have no fucking
idea what I had to escape from.

916
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:53,639
- Well, they say that there's a place

917
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,439
where you're prepared for
judgment, beyond heaven or hell.

918
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,257
That's where the real stuff begins.

919
01:14:59,926 --> 01:15:00,926
- What?

920
01:15:03,185 --> 01:15:04,463
Oh no!

921
01:15:04,464 --> 01:15:05,835
No!

922
01:15:05,836 --> 01:15:08,613
- No, wait!
(tires screech)

923
01:15:08,614 --> 01:15:09,947
- No!
- No, wait!

924
01:15:11,352 --> 01:15:14,130
(tires screech)

925
01:15:14,131 --> 01:15:16,631
(tense music)

926
01:15:20,093 --> 01:15:22,797
(coughing) Wait!

927
01:15:22,798 --> 01:15:23,798
Please!

928
01:15:25,902 --> 01:15:27,235
Please! Help me!

929
01:15:30,934 --> 01:15:32,722
I'm stuck!

930
01:15:32,723 --> 01:15:33,723
Help me!

931
01:15:34,487 --> 01:15:35,930
Wait!

932
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:36,875
John!

933
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:38,125
Don't go, John!

934
01:15:41,525 --> 01:15:43,554
Help me! Stop!

935
01:15:43,555 --> 01:15:44,824
Wait!

936
01:15:44,825 --> 01:15:49,653
John, wait! No!

937
01:15:49,654 --> 01:15:51,987
(ship hums)

938
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,710
(electricity crackles)

939
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:01,909
- No!

940
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:07,601
What the fuck is happening?

941
01:16:08,628 --> 01:16:11,069
No! No!

942
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:13,507
What the fuck is happening?

943
01:16:13,508 --> 01:16:14,508
No!

944
01:16:15,378 --> 01:16:18,514
No! What the fuck is happening?

945
01:16:18,515 --> 01:16:19,515
No!

946
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:23,973
No! No!

947
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:26,689
No! No!

948
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:33,911
(police radio squawking)

949
01:16:49,713 --> 01:16:52,630
(energy thrumming)

950
01:18:47,717 --> 01:18:50,134
(soft music)
