1
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,713
Are you following me?

2
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,715
Um... no?

3
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,371
Um, what are you doing?

4
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,773
I live here.

5
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,843
No. I live here.

6
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,846
No. 3715.

7
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:16,989
Really?

8
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,326
See?

9
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,463
Um, excuse me?

10
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,032
Uh...

11
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,767
This is my house.

12
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,740
No.
Listen this is<i> my</i> house.

13
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,016
We know each other.

14
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,054
Oh.

15
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,956
I don't know you.

16
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,427
We must have lost our memories.

17
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,933
Well...

18
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,673
I wonder how we're gonna get
those back.

19
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:15,647
Well... obviously,
we should have sex

20
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,717
and just hope for the best.

21
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,657
- Wait.
- What?

22
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,359
What if we're brother
and sister?

23
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,395
You're ruining this.

24
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,749
Hey.

25
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,883
Hey.

26
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,938
I'm gonna go to bed.

27
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,374
Okay.
I'll be in in a little bit.

28
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,810
No, come now.

29
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,014
Okay.

30
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,121
I love you.

31
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,727
I love you, too.

32
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,469
Hey.

33
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,737
Hmm?

34
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,407
I really do.

35
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,144
Good.

36
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,463
Hey, will you grab the light?

37
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,847
Hey, babe?

38
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,905
Man on TV:
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

39
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,907
<i>This team doesn't care
about winning.</i>

40
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,208
<i>They're thinking about one thing</i>

41
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,143
<i>and that is the draft.</i>

42
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,812
<i>I'm not saying they're tanking,</i>

43
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,181
<i>but the last thing
they want is a win.</i>

44
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,816
<i>This team's hope for the future</i>

45
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,751
<i>is on draft day.</i>

46
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:47,125
Hey, babe.
Where are you?

47
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,528
I don't remember what you said
you were doing today,

48
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,966
but call me, okay?

49
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,269
All right.
Love you.

50
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,676
Hi, Darcy?

51
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,879
Listen, have you spoken
with Claire today?

52
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,249
Okay.

53
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,085
No, no, everything's fine.

54
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,288
I just don't know where she is.

55
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,224
I'm sure she told me
and I'm just forgetting.

56
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,860
<i>And, hey, listen,
if you hear from her,</i>

57
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,863
<i>could you... okay, great.</i>

58
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,231
<i>Thanks, see ya.</i>

59
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,635
<i>Hey, Mr. York, sorry.</i>

60
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,104
It's David, Claire's boyfriend?

61
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,806
Is she working today?

62
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,241
She works tomorrow, not today.

63
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,610
All right.
And you haven't seen her?

64
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,111
<i>No.</i>

65
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,980
- Claire?
- Hey, what the fuck?

66
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,249
Sorry, I'm looking for Claire.
Have you seen her?

67
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,751
- You ruined my prints, man!
- Have you seen her?

68
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,819
<i>No!</i>

69
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,822
Shit.

70
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,127
Man: <i>Did you guys have a
fight before she left?</i>

71
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,863
- No, everything was fine.
- And what about recently?

72
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,599
Did you guys have
any disagreements?

73
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,267
David:
<i>No.</i>

74
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,236
Man: <i>Have you...
Have you called her parents?</i>

75
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,172
Claire?

76
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:10,375
David: <i>She doesn't have
any family, actually.</i>

77
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:13,011
Man: <i>Okay. And you've
spoken to her friends?</i>

78
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,347
Yes, I've spoken to her friends.

79
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,382
Because sometimes people
don't even realize

80
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,286
- something was wrong.
- Nothing was was wrong, all right?

81
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,855
<i>- We're happy, so...
- Okay.</i>

82
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,928
David: <i>Okay, well,
what... what should I do?</i>

83
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,663
Man:
<i>Anything helps.</i>

84
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,965
<i>You know, reach out to people
that know her.</i>

85
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,967
<i>If this isn't resolved
in a few days,</i>

86
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,203
<i>we'll get you a printout
of the report.</i>

87
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,938
A lot of people like to flyer
the neighborhood,

88
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,107
you know, telephone poles
and everything.

89
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,110
Whoa, wait, wait.
Flyer the neighborhood?

90
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,212
- <i>That's it?
- Listen, hopefully,</i> it won't come to that.

91
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,414
<i>Okay, I promise you, we're
gonna do everything we can.</i>

92
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,854
Are you following me?

93
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,856
What?

94
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,792
No.

95
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,093
Of course not.

96
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

97
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,833
You live here?

98
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,835
Uh, yeah.

99
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,037
Oh, that's embarrassing.

100
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,706
I'm sorry.

101
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,174
Don't worry about it.

102
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,975
You know,
it's just that for a second,

103
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,178
I thought
you were gonna kill me.

104
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,380
Wow, well,

105
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,283
I definitely would not do that.

106
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,719
I know,
you're probably like a...

107
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,487
Like a school teacher
or something.

108
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,856
No, I'm not a school teacher.

109
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,293
But... I like to think
I'm a pretty good guy.

110
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,861
Yeah, I can see that<i> now.</i>

111
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm Claire.

112
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,168
David.

113
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,205
Hi, David,
I just moved into 103.

114
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,942
The twisted sister fan.

115
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,310
Oh.

116
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,846
I'm in 203, right above you.

117
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:31,750
Oh, I'm sorry.
I... I can make it up to you.

118
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,818
I can get you a gift
or something.

119
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,286
- Oh, really?
- Yeah!

120
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,288
No, listen,
I'm kidding, seriously.

121
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,191
I mean, you can get me gifts,
by all means,

122
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,793
but don't worry about it.

123
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,261
Welcome to the building, Claire.

124
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,074
- Hey, David.
- Hi, Colleen.

125
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,076
How you doin'?

126
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,947
I'm... I'm good.

127
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:40,018
Well, I really hate
to do this to you,

128
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,588
but I really can't wait
any longer.

129
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,590
I'm so sorry.

130
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:48,293
It's, you know,
if it were up to me...

131
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,594
I understand.

132
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,196
Okay.

133
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,597
All right, see ya.

134
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,435
Hello?

135
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,571
Sorry for dropping in
without any warning.

136
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,573
I didn't think I was gonna be
here more than an hour.

137
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,610
Don't worry about it.
It's good to see you.

138
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:43,014
It's nice to actually talk
to someone who really knew her.

139
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,450
It's...
It's been too long.

140
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,519
I know, I know.
I'm sorry about that.

141
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,922
How have you been doing?

142
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,291
Just the same, you know?

143
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,927
It's just... it...

144
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,662
It's too brutal, man, you know?

145
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,398
It's... it's unreal.

146
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,003
Yeah, you know,
best-case scenario

147
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,273
is that she just left.

148
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:12,911
And cops said that happens.

149
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,380
That's the easiest thing
for me to imagine.

150
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:19,083
I mean, the...
You know, the least painful.

151
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,453
'Cause it's either that
or she...

152
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:26,624
Was killed, or she was taken.

153
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,226
- Shit.
- Yeah.

154
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,933
So, there were never
any leads or anything?

155
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,401
No.

156
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:41,372
Do you think
it's possible that...

157
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,574
You know, that she was unhappy?

158
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,476
Fuck, man.

159
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,314
I mean, she was the happiest
I'd ever seen her with you.

160
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,683
You're a good match.

161
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,251
And with Claire?

162
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,653
I don't think that
was an easy thing to find.

163
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,325
To Claire.

164
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,064
Thanks for lettin' me crash,
man.

165
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,199
Yeah.

166
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,502
So, where are you
off to tomorrow?

167
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,605
I'm going to the French alps,
man.

168
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:18,609
Friend of mine has an
adventure-guide service thing.

169
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,411
Take rich tourists climbing,

170
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,548
<i>camping, make it feel dangerous.</i>

171
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,316
<i>I'm gonna do a few trips
with him,</i>

172
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,751
<i>make some money, and then...</i>

173
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,255
Hey, what are you doing?

174
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,461
You think I can make it?

175
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,662
<i>Not without breaking your neck,</i>

176
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,030
<i>come on.</i>

177
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,531
Hey! Hey!

178
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,472
What?
You don't think I'll do it?

179
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,773
You're being an idiot.

180
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,775
Now, come on
before someone see you.

181
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,748
Dare me.

182
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,083
<i>Dare me.</i>

183
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,451
I dare you.

184
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,422
Jesus.

185
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,196
What the fuck is wrong with you?

186
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,464
<i>My leg.</i>

187
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,233
Is it broken?

188
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,809
Aw, Jesus.

189
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,447
Come on, man.

190
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,482
Come on, let's get you home.

191
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,784
Let's get you home.

192
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:36,554
Now, come on.
There you go.

193
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,189
I got you.

194
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,549
Shit.

195
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,625
There he is.
How you feeling?

196
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,461
Hey, um...

197
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,399
Sorry about last night.

198
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:25,103
I was just...
You know, I was just drunk.

199
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,572
No shit.
You all right?

200
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,344
Yeah, I'm just a little,
you know, bruised up,

201
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,113
but I'll be fine.

202
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,347
Okay.

203
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,550
Okay.

204
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,756
So, what's your plan today?

205
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,593
My flight's
not until 4:00.

206
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,462
Oh, um...

207
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,697
You know, actually,

208
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:56,400
I have a bunch of errands
to run.

209
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,170
I don't think I'll be back
before then.

210
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,140
But, you know,
you can stay as you want.

211
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:06,444
Just... you can just lock the
door when you leave, you know?

212
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,812
Awesome, man.
Thanks.

213
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,248
<i>- Yeah, no problem.</i>
- Yeah.

214
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,313
Hi.

215
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,648
Hello.

216
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,249
Are you busy?

217
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,685
No, not really.

218
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,920
Do you wanna eat?

219
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,455
I kinda owe you.

220
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,723
Come on.

221
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,827
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry about the mess.

222
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,531
No, i... I like your place.

223
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,368
Really? Do you want
a beer or something?

224
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,305
Sure. Thank you.

225
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,440
So, um...

226
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,509
What do you do, Claire?

227
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,880
Well... I'm currently pursuing
a career in dry cleaning.

228
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,317
Doing what?

229
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,719
I work at a dry cleaners.

230
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,753
Oh.

231
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,261
Did you take these?

232
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,330
Yeah, it's a... it's a hobby
of mine.

233
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,333
Oh.
I really like them.

234
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:38,603
Where is that?

235
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,472
I... Vancouver.

236
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,940
What do you do?

237
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,743
Graphic design sort of stuff.

238
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,679
Nothing too exciting, but...

239
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,381
Cool.

240
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,985
What is that you got there?

241
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,354
Dinner,
and it should be ready in,

242
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,888
ooh, three and a half minutes.

243
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,990
My god, that's not long.

244
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,625
Claire, that's not food.

245
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,892
Sure, it is.

246
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,928
You've been eating stuff
like that?

247
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,631
- Yeah, I mean...
- Put that down.

248
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,967
Okay, i... I know
a little thing about food.

249
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,437
Do you wanna come with me?
Can I make you something?

250
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,774
Come here.

251
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,980
End of the line, son.

252
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,788
Can I just stay on for a while?

253
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,823
What, this ain't a shelter,
buddy.

254
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,359
It's for gettin'
where you need to go, huh?

255
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,647
Hey! Hey!

256
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,848
What the fuck?

257
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,817
Oh...

258
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,352
<i>You're home early.</i>

259
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,020
<i>You said you'd be gone all day.</i>

260
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,555
What are you doing?

261
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,358
Oh, man. David.

262
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,426
I'm sorry.

263
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,061
What the fuck is this?

264
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:12,496
I'm just looking for something.

265
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,898
That's all.
I can't find it.

266
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,036
You weren't supposed
to come home.

267
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,638
I don't understand.

268
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,712
Yeah, Boulder
really wasn't for me.

269
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:31,482
Kind of ski bum,
beer pong situation.

270
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,950
I didn't make a ton of friends.

271
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,588
Mmm, my god, this is so good.

272
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,825
So, where did you grow up?

273
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,961
Salt lake city.
Pretty happening spot.

274
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:47,832
Yeah.
Birthplace of jazz.

275
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:48,833
Hmm?

276
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,534
Nothing.
Never mind.

277
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,071
Your family still there?

278
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,674
Family's not really part
of the picture.

279
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,975
Where are you from?

280
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,945
San Jose, California.

281
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,447
And your parents,
they still live there?

282
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,884
My, uh, my mom does, but my dad,

283
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,120
he actually died
when I was a kid.

284
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:11,856
Which is a hilarious thing
to talk about.

285
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,692
But long story short, my mom,

286
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,995
after he died, she, uh,

287
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,531
she found, Jesus.

288
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,500
Mmm.

289
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,402
I'm... I'm aware of him.

290
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,705
Yeah, well, apparently,
he was in San Jose,

291
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,441
of all places,
and now, you know,

292
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:34,445
she... she collects these
little baby figurines.

293
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,847
Yeah, like...

294
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,650
Like, you know, anything baby,

295
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,119
like little baby sculptures.

296
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:46,524
Anyways, now the house is filled

297
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:51,662
with millions
of little babies everywhere.

298
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:55,065
Like, little angel babies.

299
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,168
Yeah, it's, uh, it's a little...

300
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,702
It's a little creepy.

301
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,038
Also the whole place
is kind of, um,

302
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,507
kind of depressing,
not just my...

303
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,844
Not just my house,
but San Jose in general.

304
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,547
I don't...

305
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,550
It's a boring place.
I don't really like it there.

306
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,618
You know, it's, uh...

307
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,053
I go there sometimes, you know.

308
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,756
Not as often as I should.

309
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,524
But, yeah.

310
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,533
I wanted to do that.

311
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:32,169
That's, uh, that's okay.

312
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,771
Oh, jeez.

313
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,009
I'm still chewing my food.

314
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,178
That's... no, wait,
that's disgusting.

315
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:46,050
His name is buck Cameron.

316
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,885
So, he's a friend?

317
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,588
A friend of my girlfriend's
from college.

318
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,857
Is your girlfriend here?
Can I speak with her?

319
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,729
No, she's not here.

320
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,798
She, um...

321
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,567
She disappeared
a little over a year ago.

322
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,570
<i>She's missing.</i>

323
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,140
Hey, David.

324
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,610
Hey.
Detective Sloan.

325
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,245
I heard what happened.
You all right?

326
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:17,081
Oh, yeah.
My head hurts.

327
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,616
Yeah, I bet.

328
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,952
Doc said the cat scan
looks fine,

329
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,021
gave me some medicine
for the pain, so.

330
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,789
Good, look,
the reason why I'm here

331
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,625
is I figured
rather than letting you

332
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,793
get the runaround
from god knows who,

333
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,595
I'd take a look for you.

334
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,031
Your pal buck never
flew out yesterday,

335
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,933
not under that name at least.

336
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,302
What do you mean
under that name?

337
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,237
You said he went
to the university of Colorado

338
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,072
in Boulder, is that right?

339
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,707
Yes,
that's where Claire met him.

340
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,043
There's no record of him there.

341
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,945
That's gotta be a mistake.

342
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,813
I don't think it is, David.

343
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:55,052
On a hunch, I checked.
Claire didn't go there, either.

344
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,220
Wait, wait.

345
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,888
What do you...
What do you mean?

346
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,090
Listen, David,
you can tell me honestly.

347
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,927
Do you know
what he was looking for?

348
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,029
No.

349
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,897
So, you don't know
if he found it either.

350
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,087
Sloan: <i>Do you know what
he was looking for?</i>

351
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,062
You found me.

352
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,765
Wow, this place is cool.

353
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:55,866
Yeah.

354
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,470
What's this?

355
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,438
Oh, I made you some lunch.

356
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,774
That's so sweet.

357
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,844
Yeah, there's a little
something inside.

358
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,183
So, what have you been
working on?

359
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:15,152
Ugh, I've been looking
at it all day.

360
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,254
Well, I haven't.
Let me see.

361
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,891
You can see it when I do
something good, okay?

362
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,159
Fine.

363
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,294
When I'm done.
Okay?

364
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,340
Excuse me.

365
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:56,413
Hey, sorry, uh, sorry
to bother you, but, um...

366
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,615
Have you seen this girl?

367
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,285
Do you recognize her?
No?

368
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,572
- Jesus.
- You're not allowed back here.

369
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,007
This is off-limits.

370
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,176
I'm sorry,
I was just looking around.

371
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,744
Get out of here now.

372
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,679
- Man:<i> What is going on?</i>
- Nothing.

373
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,147
<i>Who is this?</i>

374
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,283
<i>This is no one.
He is confused.</i>

375
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:09,286
- Come on, let's go.
- <i>Wait, wait.</i>

376
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,994
Is there something
that we can help you with?

377
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,029
Yeah, have you, um...

378
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,098
Have you seen this girl?

379
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,601
Do you recognize her?

380
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,536
Fisnik, let go of the poor boy.

381
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:38,181
This girl, how do you know her?

382
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,150
Well, she's my girlfriend.

383
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:44,521
She<i> was</i> my girlfriend.
She disappeared.

384
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:48,125
I see.

385
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,593
That is very sad.

386
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,064
Do you...
Do you know her?

387
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,499
No.

388
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,667
Why would I know her?

389
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:00,504
Look, I-i don't know.
I just..

390
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:04,274
Why do you come here looking
for this girl, huh?

391
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,509
Uh...

392
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,445
I was just
looking everywhere for her.

393
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:12,282
But...
But why do you come<i> here?</i>

394
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,618
Uh... hey.

395
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,554
She just spent
a lot of time in this...

396
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,222
In this area,
so I thought maybe...

397
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,391
Ah, ah.
W-w-what is your name?

398
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,593
My name's David.

399
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:28,265
Now you have a problem, David.

400
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:31,802
What do you mean?
What's... what's my problem?

401
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,203
I don't believe you.

402
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,245
Hey, wait, I think we just have

403
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,281
a bit of a misunderstan...
Wait a minute.

404
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:47,484
David, David.
Look at me.

405
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,853
You have to convince me now.

406
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,558
I'm telling you the truth.

407
00:34:56,462 --> 00:35:00,363
Look, maybe...
Let me just go home, okay?

408
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,731
I'll just go home.

409
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:05,669
What do you do, David?
What... what is your job?

410
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:09,739
I, uh...
I do graphic design.

411
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,175
I design for websites.

412
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,276
Ah.

413
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,812
I believe that.

414
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,187
Sit down.

415
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,299
All right.

416
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,140
Now... the truth.

417
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,575
I don't...

418
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,743
I don't know what to say.

419
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,248
Don't pay attention to him.
Pay attention to me.

420
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,455
What do you want?

421
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:01,491
Why did you come here?

422
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,227
I'm looking for my girlfriend.
She disappeared.

423
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,363
I am starting
to lose Patience, David.

424
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:09,366
I know that you are
looking for this lady.

425
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,401
Why here?

426
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,270
I'm looking everywhere.

427
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,358
<i>Hey, hey, hey...</i>

428
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,335
So?

429
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,771
Uh...

430
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:51,675
I saw this address
written down. Okay?

431
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:55,912
It was written on a piece
of paper in her handwriting.

432
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,914
You know, I was just
cleaning out her things and...

433
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,852
You know,
I thought I'd just come here.

434
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,722
I was just...
Just hoping that maybe...

435
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,628
What is her name?

436
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,332
Her name is Claire.

437
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:16,334
Claire.

438
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,936
Maybe it would be better for you

439
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,405
if you stopped looking for her.

440
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,443
Maybe you don't like
what you find.

441
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,406
David:
<i>Detective Sloan?</i>

442
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:57,807
Yeah, um...

443
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,711
I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

444
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,481
I was hoping you could check
on a few things for me.

445
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,621
Can I ask you a question?

446
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,456
Sure.

447
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,730
You always change the subject

448
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:58,868
whenever I ask you about
your family or anything.

449
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,005
That's not a question.

450
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,544
Why can't we talk about it?

451
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,546
Why are you so interested in it?

452
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,514
Well, I don't know, because...

453
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,119
I'm in love with you.

454
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,460
You are?

455
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:24,661
Yeah.

456
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,865
I mean, should I not be?

457
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,442
Well, it's kind of
out of my control, so...

458
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,416
What is it that you want?

459
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,620
What are you after?

460
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,660
You.

461
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,721
Oh, shit.

462
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,635
Does, uh, does your head hurt?

463
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,509
You want some of these?

464
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,578
<i>It helps.</i>

465
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:06,956
I want you to answer
a few questions first,

466
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,693
and then I'll give it to you.

467
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,795
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

468
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,898
I'm not gonna talk to you.

469
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,038
Okay.

470
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
All right.

471
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,847
You're not gonna use that.

472
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,815
How do you know?

473
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,620
Just a feeling you get.

474
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:40,023
<i>What feeling?</i>

475
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:41,090
Fear.

476
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,129
<i>And you're not afraid right now?</i>

477
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,564
No.

478
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,020
<i>What about now?</i>

479
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:15,692
<i>Do you know how much this hurts?</i>

480
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,097
Yeah, well, I do.

481
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,632
Why did you come here?

482
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,837
For information.

483
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,639
<i>What information?</i>

484
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:33,142
Anything I could find.

485
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,744
Or get out of you.

486
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,182
I don't know anything.

487
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,850
<i>You'd be surprised
what you know.</i>

488
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,325
Do you know what happened
to Claire?

489
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,060
Huh?

490
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,262
Did you do something to her?

491
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,739
You think I know something?

492
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:04,741
We're the same, David.

493
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:07,110
We're both looking
for the same thing.

494
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:09,712
Yeah? What?

495
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,149
Her.

496
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,374
Hey, David.

497
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:39,375
Hey.

498
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,377
Can I come in?

499
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,681
Yeah, uh...

500
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,983
Jesus Christ.

501
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:49,419
Yeah.
Sorry about... the mess.

502
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,024
I did some digging around
like you asked.

503
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,325
Called in some favors.

504
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,328
Why don't you sit down?

505
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,970
She was lying to you.

506
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,909
Okay.

507
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:14,777
She didn't go to school
in Boulder.

508
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:16,446
She didn't grow up
in salt lake city, either.

509
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:20,349
Found no record
of her parents there.

510
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,485
Why would Claire lie about that?

511
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,020
I mean, I'm looking into it,

512
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:26,989
but listen,
this girl's fucked up.

513
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,826
You know, she was clearly
a part of something

514
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:33,296
or she just wasn't
who you thought she was.

515
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,072
No, not really.

516
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,108
No, I paid for a lot of things,

517
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:48,311
but, you know,
she just didn't make that much.

518
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,381
Right.

519
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,983
Look, I think the best thing
for you to do

520
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:56,285
is to put her out
of your head, move on.

521
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,026
Fuckin' cats.

522
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:05,461
It's just clumsy.

523
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:08,364
Hey, you know,
thanks for your help.

524
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,170
Look, if anything else pops up,

525
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,438
I'll let you know.

526
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,487
Hey, hey, hey.

527
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,194
Come on.

528
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:46,569
All right.

529
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,406
How do you know Claire?

530
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:52,275
I don't know her.

531
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:54,443
Why are you looking for her?

532
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,419
Open my shirt.

533
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:05,188
What?

534
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,923
Open my shirt.

535
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,891
You want to know why,
open my shirt.

536
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,395
Pull it open.

537
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:19,402
There's two more in my stomach.

538
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,373
She didn't expect me to live.

539
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,610
No.

540
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:30,279
No, that's not right.

541
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,447
Claire couldn't...

542
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,216
Claire?

543
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:39,622
Eve is what she call herself.

544
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:42,391
It was my brother she was after.

545
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,493
He wasn't as lucky I was.

546
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:50,633
They met in a bar in Chicago.

547
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:52,501
He pick her up.

548
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,871
The hotel Marlaina.

549
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,641
You know it?

550
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:02,311
<i>Yeah.
It's nice.</i>

551
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:04,647
<i>Also a good place to go</i>

552
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:08,417
<i>if you're looking to pick up
high-end whore.</i>

553
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,652
<i>And he was.</i>

554
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,090
<i>Not my brother's
typical taste, but...</i>

555
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,161
She put a knife in him.

556
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,970
Do you have any brothers?

557
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,032
What would you do
if you found her?

558
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,704
What would you do?

559
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,387
My people are going to come
looking for me soon.

560
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,655
Good.
Then they can cut you loose.

561
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:33,095
Oh. How much is this?

562
00:50:33,097 --> 00:50:35,598
<i>They're not going to be happy
with what you've done.</i>

563
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,101
Well, maybe you can
put in a good word for me.

564
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:41,537
All right.
What's your name?

565
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,805
Aleksander.

566
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:46,108
Aleksander.

567
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,810
I'm David.

568
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:50,146
Let's hope we never meet again.

569
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,534
One ticket to Vancouver, please.

570
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,514
Here we are.
Lots of light.

571
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:27,616
- Mm.
- Just painted.

572
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:30,252
Yeah, it's...
It's wonderful.

573
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,589
<i>All these houses
were built in the '20s.</i>

574
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,391
<i>This one's 1916.</i>

575
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:37,660
<i>Bought this place
and the one next door</i>

576
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:40,196
<i>about ten years ago,
fixed 'em up.</i>

577
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:42,298
<i>Please, take a look around.</i>

578
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,144
David:
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

579
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:56,512
Claire:
<i>I like it.</i>

580
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,471
- What are you doing?
- Here.

581
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,907
I'm just showing you
how to do it right.

582
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,276
I like how I do it.

583
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:29,545
Yeah, but it's wrong.

584
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:31,280
It's not gonna look as good.

585
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:33,249
I know how to paint.

586
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:36,152
Mmm, I don't know if you do.

587
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:38,320
Oh?
Gonna be an asshole?

588
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,422
Hey, I'm never an asshole.

589
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:42,191
Right now you are.

590
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:43,492
Mmm, not really.

591
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:46,228
I'm just kinda, you know,
being normal.

592
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,831
Well, agree to disagree,
I guess.

593
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,800
Baby,
we just have so much to do,

594
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:54,570
and the ceiling
is gonna take forever.

595
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:55,905
You know what?
I'll do the ceiling.

596
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:57,406
You just relax.

597
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:02,411
You're not
going to do the ceiling.

598
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:03,846
Why not?

599
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:06,549
Because it's gonna be
all messy and bad.

600
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:09,852
Like your wall,
which... sucks.

601
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,453
You know what?

602
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:13,255
I'm gonna do the ceiling
right now,

603
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:15,357
- and it's gonna be incredible.

604
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,393
Okay.
If you say so.

605
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:20,362
Yeah. Maybe you should go
have a beer.

606
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,731
You're getting very worked up
about the paint job.

607
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,533
Hey.

608
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,302
Word. Great.

609
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:27,736
I'm all about that.

610
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:28,804
Yeah, yeah.

611
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,618
<i>David, I'm done.</i>

612
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:55,231
Wow.

613
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,900
That's, uh, that's beautiful.

614
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,305
You mind?

615
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,350
David: <i>This is gonna
be hell to paint over.</i>

616
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:16,285
Tomorrow.

617
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:17,686
Okay.

618
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,497
Gimme your hand.

619
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:02,698
I don't get it.

620
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,066
"Sarah?"

621
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,737
It's a joke.

622
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,706
Isn't Sarah the name
of the waitress

623
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,775
that you like
at what's-it-called?

624
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:15,511
What? Sophie's?

625
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:16,979
Is her name Sarah?

626
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,580
Yeah, right?

627
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,482
It's a joke.

628
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,552
Ah, it's incredibly hilarious.

629
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,363
Much better.

630
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:39,635
Yeah.

631
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:22,678
David: <i>So I got
sort of a strange question.</i>

632
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,014
Do you, uh...

633
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:28,717
Recognize this guy?

634
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,588
You know who he is?

635
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,590
What's this about?

636
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,025
Well, I, um, I got these photos

637
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:38,460
off an old camera that I bought,

638
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:39,762
and I thought maybe

639
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:43,766
I could get them back
to their rightful owner.

640
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,701
Any ideas?

641
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,503
That's Mr. Garan.

642
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:51,473
Mr. Garan.
Does he work here?

643
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:53,409
<i>He used to.</i>

644
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,612
<i>Mr. Garan passed
five years ago.</i>

645
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:58,781
<i>He was a good man.</i>

646
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:00,682
All right.

647
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:03,786
Well, I'm sorry to...
Sorry to hear that.

648
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:05,154
Thank you.

649
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,494
Do you know, was he married?

650
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:57,639
David: <i>Hello.
My name is David.</i>

651
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,241
Are you a reporter?

652
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:01,076
No, no, absolutely not.

653
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:05,647
Look, this is a little
hard to explain, but, um...

654
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,116
My... my girlfriend,
she disappeared

655
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:11,987
a little over a year ago,
and ever since then,

656
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:15,057
I, um...
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

657
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,725
I just know that she spent a lot

658
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:18,260
of time here in Vancouver

659
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:21,497
before I knew her,
and I know that she

660
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,932
was really interested
in your... in your husband.

661
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:28,804
Look, I'm just grasping
at straws here,

662
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:30,839
and I just...

663
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,941
Do you...
Do you recognize her?

664
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,913
I met a lot of people
with Richard.

665
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,014
- I'm sorry.
- Well, her name was...

666
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,849
I don't know her.

667
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,252
I'm very sorry.
Good luck.

668
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,692
Agh! Aah!

669
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,677
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

670
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:24,946
No, stop! Stop!
Please!

671
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,282
Oh...

672
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,220
- Stop!

673
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:35,290
No, please! Help me!

674
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:38,160
Help me!
No, no, no! Please!

675
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,344
- Don't move!
- Get down on your knees!

676
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:58,413
Down on your knees!

677
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,837
Where are we going?

678
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:39,387
- <i>Get out.</i>

679
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:02,410
David, how do you do?
John hall.

680
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:03,845
Thanks, guys.

681
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,383
I apologize,
we must have frightened you.

682
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,553
What do you want?

683
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,122
I wanna talk to you.

684
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,057
And who the fuck are you?

685
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:19,427
I work for the government.
Defense.

686
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,565
I tell ya...

687
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:28,537
I don't usually go in for this
nature shit, but god damn.

688
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:31,206
This is something, huh?

689
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,374
Take a look at that.

690
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,445
Makes your heart go.

691
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:43,819
Yeah, you're looking
for your ex-girlfriend.

692
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,024
You knew her, I guess?

693
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:50,091
Yes.

694
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,363
I'm here to answer
a few of your questions.

695
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:58,333
The ones I can, at least.
Give you some closure.

696
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,535
But none of this
is gonna be easy, David.

697
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,473
Okay?

698
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,012
Claire worked for us
in a variety of capacities.

699
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,547
Like what?

700
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:17,519
Mmm, it was required that she
establish a cover, a life,

701
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,955
one that would allow
for a great deal of travel,

702
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:21,597
one that wouldn't draw
a lot of attention.

703
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,163
So, where is she?

704
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:32,167
July of last year, she was
called in for an assignment.

705
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:34,135
She was killed in action
36 hours later.

706
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,038
I'm sorry, David.

707
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,313
No.

708
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:48,250
See, you're lying.
That doesn't make sense.

709
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:50,318
I really am sorry to tell you.

710
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:57,292
Okay.

711
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:03,398
Okay, well, do you have any...

712
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,301
Any proof, huh?

713
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,436
Of any of this?

714
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:12,073
I mean, you're so interested
in giving me closure.

715
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,653
Open this if you have to,
but I've seen what's inside,

716
01:05:24,655 --> 01:05:26,688
and I wouldn't, if I were you.

717
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,989
I mean it.

718
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,727
We need you to stop digging
around her past, David.

719
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:44,032
She handled sensitive material.

720
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:46,568
Sensitive situations
that don't need stirring

721
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,303
by your inexpert hands.

722
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,174
It's dangerous.
For you, for all of us.

723
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,649
Just let it go, okay?

724
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:05,153
You're still on the outside.
Stay there.

725
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:11,760
<i>I can't guarantee
your safety otherwise.</i>

726
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:17,499
<i>Take your time.</i>

727
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,251
Hey!

728
01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:42,157
Babe!

729
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,133
Hey.

730
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:58,373
Hey, Claire.

731
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:04,612
Babe.

732
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,514
Babe. Let me in.

733
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,218
What's wrong?

734
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:15,623
Claire.

735
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,293
Answer me.

736
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,496
Claire, open the door.

737
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,734
- - Claire,
open the door, please?

738
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,873
Cl... Claire!

739
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,177
Claire!

740
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,448
Hey. Hey, hey.

741
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:45,220
Oh... ah, Jesus Christ.
Oh, my god, what happened?

742
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:46,554
I got mugged.

743
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:50,658
I was stupid,
I... I tried to fight back.

744
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,227
No, no, no, no.

745
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:54,262
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

746
01:08:57,267 --> 01:09:00,168
Come here.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.

747
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,185
David:
<i>So, what was her name?</i>

748
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,360
Was it Claire?

749
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,863
Can I ask you a question?

750
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:33,902
What brought you
to Garan's house?

751
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,173
Just photos.

752
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:41,643
Old photos she had
before I knew her.

753
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:44,812
Regular Philip Marlowe,
am I right?

754
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:47,515
So, who was he?

755
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,750
<i>You tell me.</i>

756
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,788
Some rich venture capitalist?

757
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,657
That's right.

758
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:58,693
Weekends, he liked to put
on a red hood,

759
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,895
convince discontented teens
to join the cause

760
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:02,664
of white supremacy.

761
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,832
<i>He put enough cash
in the right pockets</i>

762
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,968
<i>to keep that fact secret.</i>

763
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:10,805
So what, you just...
Had him killed?

764
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,308
Richard Garan
died of a heart attack.

765
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:21,783
Oh, yeah.

766
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:24,786
I had a run in with
some Columbian mercenaries

767
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:26,955
a couple years back.

768
01:10:26,957 --> 01:10:29,257
More metal than man
at this point.

769
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,763
That must've been
a long recovery.

770
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:37,565
Oof. Two years
physical therapy

771
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,967
before I stopped

772
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:42,503
walking like a zombie
from those bad movies.

773
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:45,506
<i>What, were you, like,
on crutches</i>

774
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:46,641
<i>for a while or something?</i>

775
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:47,942
A cane.

776
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:59,320
You said you have those photos
on your computer?

777
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:01,356
<i>You mind if I take a look?</i>

778
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:03,358
Did I say that?

779
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,393
Yeah.
You mind if I take a look?

780
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,596
No, um...

781
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,867
Thanks.

782
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,377
Hmm.

783
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:35,990
<i>I'm asking myself, "why is he
so interested in my rehab?"</i>

784
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,859
But I realized,

785
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:40,695
you haven't been completely
honest with me, have you?

786
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,533
<i>David...</i>

787
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,703
Where are the negatives?

788
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,476
No. Really?

789
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,615
Son of a bitch.

790
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:03,951
It's amazing how things
change so quick.

791
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:07,722
What was it,
a minute ago, 80 seconds tops,

792
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:10,058
you made that comment about
my leg and tipped your hand.

793
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,960
<i>You were gonna go home,
live a life,</i>

794
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:16,331
<i>meet a girl probably,
have a couple kids.</i>

795
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,466
She's still alive.

796
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:19,634
Hmm?

797
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,874
She's alive.
Isn't she?

798
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:29,911
She's dead.

799
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:34,849
Take this left.

800
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:43,491
Where'd you get that?

801
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:44,792
Let me out.

802
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:47,395
Here.
Pull over!

803
01:12:47,397 --> 01:12:49,430
No, don't...
Don't pull over, Michael.

804
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:57,739
What a mess.

805
01:12:57,741 --> 01:13:00,141
<i>Nothing's gone as I intended,
not one thing.</i>

806
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:29,657
Hey.

807
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:33,160
Hey.

808
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:53,214
I tried you
at the... the darkroom.

809
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,918
I had my headphones on.

810
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,619
<i>Mmm. How was it?</i>

811
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,657
It was fine.

812
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:04,825
Did you bring anything back?

813
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:07,328
<i>No.</i>

814
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,196
There wasn't anything
good enough to save.

815
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:14,735
Is something wrong?

816
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:18,639
I'm just tired.

817
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,612
And that's the end of it.

818
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,349
Just tired, David.

819
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:32,086
What, you wanna have a whole
conversation about that?

820
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,355
I just haven't seen you all day.

821
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:36,290
<i>I was working.</i>

822
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,359
No, I, uh, I know.

823
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:39,894
You've been working every night

824
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:41,896
for the past three weeks.

825
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:43,698
<i>I haven't seen you.</i>

826
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,267
<i>I'm sorry that I wanna have
a conversation with you</i>

827
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:50,371
- <i>when I do.</i>
- Yeah, well, I'm sorry that I wanna sleep when I'm tired.

828
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:56,110
Wow, you're... you're being
such a bitch right now.

829
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,112
What?

830
01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:59,847
Fuck you.

831
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:00,849
<i>Hey.</i>

832
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:08,155
Hey, does this have to do
with what... happened?

833
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:10,925
What are you talking about?
Does what have to do with it?

834
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:14,862
The fact
that you won't speak to me,

835
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,197
that you're a million miles away

836
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,065
and I can't bring you back.

837
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:20,334
Don't be such a drama queen.

838
01:17:20,336 --> 01:17:22,970
I'm right<i> here.</i>

839
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,906
Then why does it feel like
as close as I get to you,

840
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:27,775
- I'm not even...
- <i>I don't know, David.</i>

841
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:32,346
Maybe I'm broken that way.
Maybe it's impossible.

842
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:35,716
It sure fucking seems like it,
Claire.

843
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:37,284
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

844
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:39,820
I'm glad
that we figured that out.

845
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,122
I'm gonna go to sleep.

846
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:47,061
All right.

847
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:49,997
Good night.

848
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:59,093
Can I help you?

849
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:01,228
Hi, um...

850
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:03,497
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a minute.

851
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,232
Okay.

852
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:06,234
It's about Dana.

853
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,139
Have a... have a seat.

854
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,274
Thanks.

855
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,345
Oh, did you get married?

856
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:20,247
Yeah. Elise.

857
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,383
Year ago next week.

858
01:20:22,385 --> 01:20:24,351
So...

859
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:28,155
So... you and Dana.

860
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:31,492
She went missing five years ago?

861
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:32,993
Yeah.

862
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,061
Vanished.

863
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:38,499
You two were happy?

864
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,968
I don't know.

865
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,604
I thought we were.

866
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:46,607
What are you getting at?

867
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:47,942
I'm sorry.

868
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:54,248
I met her...

869
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:57,318
About four years ago.

870
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,190
Where?

871
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,192
Los Angeles.

872
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,864
Is she, uh...

873
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,935
She's gone.

874
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:18,906
It was a bad car accident.

875
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:20,207
It was about a year ago.

876
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:25,946
And ever since then, I...

877
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:31,385
Started looking into her past,
which led me to you.

878
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:36,023
And I just thought
that you'd want to know,

879
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:38,292
just so you could stop
looking...

880
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:41,228
In case you were.

881
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,329
Yeah.

882
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:49,670
Fuck, I'm...

883
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:53,240
Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't...

884
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:56,443
I didn't expect to be
thinking about this today.

885
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:01,649
She talk about me?

886
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:05,986
She didn't tell me much
about her past.

887
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:09,256
Sounds like her.

888
01:22:11,294 --> 01:22:14,361
I did look for her for a while,

889
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:19,133
but who walks out like that?

890
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:23,070
May... maybe I was an asshole?
I think about it.

891
01:22:23,072 --> 01:22:26,674
I think maybe i... maybe I was
a little too hard on her.

892
01:22:26,676 --> 01:22:32,046
She just... you know,
we just weren't a good match.

893
01:22:32,048 --> 01:22:33,514
Doesn't mean you walk out,
though.

894
01:22:33,516 --> 01:22:36,550
You don't let a person wonder,

895
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:39,186
even if she hated me.

896
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:41,021
She didn't.

897
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:47,094
I'm certain she loved you.

898
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:48,495
You can't fake that.

899
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:53,000
Well, this is all I have.

900
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,637
Dana took those.

901
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:14,121
Well, listen,
I appreciate you coming,

902
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:17,257
but I should get to work.

903
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:18,659
Of course, yeah.

904
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,299
Hey, Charlie.

905
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:27,001
This guy here.

906
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,405
That's Kyle.

907
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:33,574
<i>That's Dana's friend
from... from home.</i>

908
01:23:33,576 --> 01:23:36,243
<i>That's Kyle.</i>

909
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:38,178
You two stay in touch?

910
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,481
<i>I mean,
not really since she left.</i>

911
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:43,450
<i>We talked a few times,
but you know.</i>

912
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:47,254
You got a number for him?
I'd like to reach out.

913
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:52,559
David: <i>Hey, Kyle. Or buck.</i>

914
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:54,561
Or whatever
the fuck your name is.

915
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:56,397
This is David Larraine.

916
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:59,166
Yeah, I got your number,
fuckshit, and, hey, listen,

917
01:23:59,168 --> 01:24:01,735
you know that thing you were
looking for at my place?

918
01:24:01,737 --> 01:24:04,638
<i>Well, guess what?
I have it.</i>

919
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,540
<i>If you want it,
you're gonna meet me</i>

920
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,777
<i>on the southwest corner
of Blake and Van nuys</i>

921
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:13,113
<i>the morning of the sixth,
3:00 A.M.</i>

922
01:24:13,115 --> 01:24:15,049
<i>Come alone, and, I don't know,</i>

923
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:17,217
<i>bring a million dollars
with you.</i>

924
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,553
<i>If not, these pictures
are going everywhere,</i>

925
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,455
<i>and I have a feeling
if that happens,</i>

926
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:23,557
<i>you're gonna wind up
in a ditch someplace.</i>

927
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:26,060
<i>Am I right?</i>

928
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:27,327
<i>See you Friday.</i>

929
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,357
<i>Hello?</i>

930
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:06,827
Hey, Aleksander.
This is David Larraine.

931
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:08,629
If you wanna know where Eve is,

932
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:11,265
I'm meeting her
at 3:00 A.M.

933
01:26:11,267 --> 01:26:14,434
She'll be in a black SUV
parked in a lot

934
01:26:14,436 --> 01:26:18,272
on the south side of Van nuys
just east of Blake.

935
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:20,207
She's all yours.

936
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,723
What the fuck is this?

937
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,263
Shit.

938
01:27:16,265 --> 01:27:17,898
Man:
<i>Where is she?</i>

939
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:31,478
- Buck:<i> David?</i>
- Throw your phone in the gutter

940
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,514
and head up Van nuys,
enter the parking structure.

941
01:27:34,516 --> 01:27:36,383
<i>On the left,
there'll be a car parked</i>

942
01:27:36,385 --> 01:27:37,618
<i>with its door open.</i>

943
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,753
Get in.

944
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:41,515
I want to be left alone.
Okay?

945
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:43,483
I will go away,

946
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:47,754
and you will never hear
from me again.

947
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:49,489
I have what you're looking for,

948
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,425
but you're never gonna find it.

949
01:28:51,427 --> 01:28:55,562
If I die, everybody finds it.

950
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:57,631
That's not how this works.

951
01:28:57,633 --> 01:28:59,766
How does it work?

952
01:28:59,768 --> 01:29:01,968
You are just a scared guy

953
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:05,505
who threw me in the back
of a blacked-out beemer.

954
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,341
We're something else.

955
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:10,344
We're a different category
of person.

956
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:13,347
You wanna keep those pictures
as an insurance policy?

957
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:16,917
People like I work for can't
live with that in this world.

958
01:29:16,919 --> 01:29:20,554
If I die, they get out.

959
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:23,657
To who, David?
Hmm?

960
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:25,659
You haven't thought
this through.

961
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:27,060
<i>The New York times?</i>

962
01:29:27,062 --> 01:29:29,896
They won't know
what the fuck they are.

963
01:29:29,898 --> 01:29:31,631
I'm sorry, David.

964
01:29:31,633 --> 01:29:36,470
Sarah was a threat.
You are just a loose end.

965
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:39,473
And there is a bullet
coming your way right now.

966
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:41,541
It is cutting
through this world,

967
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,977
and it can only end up
in one place.

968
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:45,479
No.

969
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:47,848
I'll find a way.

970
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:50,450
You underestimate me, buck.

971
01:29:50,452 --> 01:29:53,520
You have every step of the way.

972
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:55,655
Mm, no, not this time.

973
01:29:55,657 --> 01:29:57,657
Smart, blacking out the windows,

974
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,025
no one can see in.

975
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:01,895
Trouble is,
you can't see out, either.

976
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,931
You have no idea what's coming.

977
01:30:07,136 --> 01:30:10,504
- Out of the car! Get out of the car!
- Hand in the air!

978
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:13,039
One the ground!
Don't move! Don't fucking...

979
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,146
Are you mad?

980
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:57,651
Come here.

981
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:18,605
Have I really been
a million miles away?

982
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,042
Mm-hmm.

983
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,180
I got lost.

984
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,586
It happens now and then.

985
01:31:32,588 --> 01:31:35,088
Okay.

986
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:37,057
But you can't leave me
out there, though.

987
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:41,862
You gotta bring me back.

988
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:55,041
I always will.

989
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,512
Promise?

990
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:03,617
No matter what.

991
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:46,026
David.
We meet again.

992
01:32:51,799 --> 01:32:53,066
Where's the film?

993
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:58,271
I'm not going to tell you.

994
01:32:58,273 --> 01:33:02,576
Okay. That's what
I thought you'd say.

995
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:04,811
I'm gonna send a man in here.

996
01:33:04,813 --> 01:33:06,746
It's his job to get information

997
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:09,215
from reluctant sources.

998
01:33:09,217 --> 01:33:11,785
Usually he's working
with trained operatives

999
01:33:11,787 --> 01:33:14,220
who've been prepared
for such treatment

1000
01:33:14,222 --> 01:33:16,623
and who believe if they
give up the information,

1001
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:19,960
it will cost many of their
countrymen their lives,

1002
01:33:19,962 --> 01:33:23,063
not to mention compromise their
own place in the afterlife.

1003
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,800
You, on the other hand,

1004
01:33:26,802 --> 01:33:27,867
are protecting the whereabouts

1005
01:33:27,869 --> 01:33:29,903
of a roll of film,

1006
01:33:29,905 --> 01:33:32,739
the significance of which
you don't understand,

1007
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:35,875
for a dead girl who lied to you,

1008
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:39,879
<i>used you,
and made a fool of you.</i>

1009
01:33:39,881 --> 01:33:41,848
Anyway, I'm gonna walk out.

1010
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:44,150
He's gonna come in,
and in a few minutes,

1011
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:46,853
he's gonna leave
with what he came for.

1012
01:33:46,855 --> 01:33:52,292
<i>Or</i> you could tell me now,
spare yourself the discomfort.

1013
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:05,805
All right.

1014
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,907
You're very brave, David.

1015
01:34:07,909 --> 01:34:10,210
I admire that.
Truly.

1016
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,789
Thanks for coming.

1017
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:04,297
David?

1018
01:35:04,299 --> 01:35:05,732
My name's David.

1019
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:19,879
Where's the film?

1020
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:24,451
I don't... I don't have it.

1021
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:38,131
Where's the film?

1022
01:35:38,133 --> 01:35:41,101
I don't have it.
I don't have it. I don't...

1023
01:35:44,306 --> 01:35:46,740
Please, please, stop!

1024
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:47,907
Stop! Stop!

1025
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,980
Where's the film?

1026
01:35:59,286 --> 01:36:02,288
Stop! St...

1027
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:22,976
What's going on?

1028
01:36:22,978 --> 01:36:25,245
- Do not move!

1029
01:37:49,331 --> 01:37:51,297
David.

1030
01:37:51,299 --> 01:37:54,400
What did he do to you?

1031
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:56,369
Where have you been?

1032
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:00,440
Why did they do this?

1033
01:38:00,442 --> 01:38:02,542
I came looking for you.

1034
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:05,445
I just got so close.

1035
01:38:05,447 --> 01:38:06,479
How?

1036
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:09,582
The film in the garden.

1037
01:38:09,584 --> 01:38:10,984
Your film.

1038
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:30,436
Where is it?

1039
01:38:30,438 --> 01:38:32,205
Home.

1040
01:38:32,207 --> 01:38:33,907
It's at our home.

1041
01:38:39,681 --> 01:38:41,247
We have to...
Have to get out of here.

1042
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:42,582
Wait, wait.

1043
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:43,650
David, there's no time for that.

1044
01:38:43,652 --> 01:38:45,585
We gotta go.

1045
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:48,454
You can use one of these?
Come on.

1046
01:39:14,015 --> 01:39:15,248
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1047
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,316
Come on.

1048
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:38,705
David:
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

1049
01:39:45,713 --> 01:39:48,014
Damn it. Shit.

1050
01:39:48,016 --> 01:39:50,750
We gotta get out of here.
Get out!

1051
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,360
Shit.

1052
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:10,536
Stay here.

1053
01:40:18,045 --> 01:40:20,046
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

1054
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:36,462
Get off the bike!
Off the bike!

1055
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:44,103
Get out of here, come on.
Come on, let's go!

1056
01:41:40,494 --> 01:41:43,262
Claire: <i>Where is it, David?
The film?</i>

1057
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:46,232
In the mail.

1058
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:52,538
Well, that's not good.

1059
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,674
What is it?

1060
01:41:54,676 --> 01:41:58,377
It's proof
that hall had been turned.

1061
01:41:58,379 --> 01:42:00,213
It was...

1062
01:42:00,215 --> 01:42:03,516
This was my only protection.

1063
01:42:03,518 --> 01:42:05,384
- Claire...
- We have to get out of here.

1064
01:42:05,386 --> 01:42:06,752
Claire. Wait. Stop.

1065
01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:09,755
- They'll be looking for us...
- Stop.

1066
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:11,324
I haven't seen you.

1067
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:16,596
Are you hurt?

1068
01:42:18,366 --> 01:42:20,666
Where? David?

1069
01:42:20,668 --> 01:42:24,303
David. It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1070
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:33,312
Who are you?

1071
01:42:37,918 --> 01:42:39,585
I'm a lot of different people.

1072
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:44,257
I looked for you.

1073
01:42:44,259 --> 01:42:47,160
I know.

1074
01:42:47,162 --> 01:42:49,162
I didn't think you'd understand.

1075
01:42:49,164 --> 01:42:51,197
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:56,903
If you come with me...

1077
01:42:56,905 --> 01:42:58,838
We can never, ever come back.

1078
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:09,815
Stay here.

1079
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:24,397
Claire:
<i>Shit.</i>

1080
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:26,832
- What?
- <i>We're surrounded.</i>

1081
01:43:38,845 --> 01:43:41,480
So, what do we do now?

1082
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:45,251
We fight.

1083
01:44:27,961 --> 01:44:30,663
<i>Hey. Look at that.</i>

1084
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,968
I didn't know
you could still see it.

1085
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:40,706
<i>Me neither.</i>

1086
01:44:44,011 --> 01:44:47,913
Hey.
Where we gonna go?

1087
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:52,385
Anywhere you want.

1088
01:44:52,387 --> 01:44:55,521
Well, I wanna go someplace warm,

1089
01:44:55,523 --> 01:44:56,989
somewhere I've never been.

1090
01:44:56,991 --> 01:44:58,958
Far away?

1091
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,960
Yeah.

1092
01:45:00,962 --> 01:45:03,429
When?

1093
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:07,566
Let's go right now.

1094
01:45:07,568 --> 01:45:13,372
Hall's men are out back.
Aleksander's are out front.

1095
01:45:13,374 --> 01:45:15,374
<i>What do you think
our best chances are?</i>

1096
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,014
Not good either way.

1097
01:45:22,016 --> 01:45:23,482
All right.

1098
01:45:28,088 --> 01:45:29,755
You choose.

1099
01:45:29,757 --> 01:45:31,624
<i>No, you.</i>

1100
01:45:31,626 --> 01:45:33,592
Okay, fine.

1101
01:45:33,594 --> 01:45:37,863
South America?

1102
01:45:37,865 --> 01:45:39,498
Are we really gonna do this?

1103
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:42,501
Yes.

1104
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:44,637
We have to.

1105
01:45:46,941 --> 01:45:48,374
Okay.

1106
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:00,486
Ready?

1107
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:03,823
On three.

1108
01:46:03,825 --> 01:46:05,791
Hey, babe?

1109
01:46:05,793 --> 01:46:07,827
I love you.

1110
01:46:07,829 --> 01:46:08,829
Hey.

1111
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:12,565
Let's live.

1112
01:46:12,567 --> 01:46:13,799
Yeah.

1113
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:19,505
- Okay.
- Ready?

1114
01:46:19,507 --> 01:46:22,742
Both:
One, two, three.
