1
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:52,029
And now it's time for Political Jeopardy!.

2
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,868
From Washington DC we have Frank. Frank is

3
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:05,042
the manager of a spy shop and a conspiracy
buff. Next to him is Natalie from Seattle.

4
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:09,849
She is an elementary school drama teacher
and aspiring playwright. And from Philadelphia,

5
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,009
Pennsylvania our returning champion Jerry.
Jerry is a veterinarian and a producer of

6
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:23,959
his very own cable access show. And now it's
time to meet our host. Here's Sid.

7
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:31,080
Hey! How you doing! All right ladies and gentlemen,
we've got one hell of a show tonight. The

8
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,200
object of the game is to collect as many Prozac
tablets as you possibly can by giving the

9
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,159
correct responses to the questions on the
board. Please remember to phrase your responses

10
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:52,230
in question form. Are you ready? Fantastic!
Okay! Tonight's categories are: censored words,

11
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:59,290
communicable diseases, crooked politicians,
conspiracies, constitutional calamities, and

12
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,319
corporate cons. Let's get started. Jerry as
a returning champion you make the first selection.

13
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:12,680
Can I have censored words for one tablet please.
You sure can. A word placed on the tombstones

14
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,030
of 16th century prostitutes.
What is fuck.

15
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:23,840
That is correct! All right, please make another
selection.

16
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,650
Communicable diseases for one tablet please.
This device can give you over 90% protection

17
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,920
from STDs and unwanted pregnancies.
What is a vibrator.

18
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:46,140
I’m sorry that's incorrect. Frank.
What is it was a condom.

19
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:54,180
That is correct. Please make another selection.
I would like to take five tablets of conspiracy,

20
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,592
Sid.
Oh wow looky here, Frank, you lucky dog. You

21
00:03:56,592 --> 00:04:03,189
have found today's daily dosage. That enables
you to take any or all of your Prozac tablets.

22
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:06,860
Since you only have one, you can wager up
to five.

23
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,200
I want to take them all.
Frank I like your style. For five tablets,

24
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,111
they have implanted a recording device in
your filling to monitor your every move.

25
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:20,920
Who are the space aliens.
You need to be more specific.

26
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,350
Who is the federal government.
That is correct, Frank. You have earned today’s

27
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:34,580
daily dosage. Katie go on over there and medicate
him. Oh this is fantastic. This has been such

28
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,400
an exciting show. Congratulations Frank. Ladies
and gentlemen, that's all the show we have

29
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,580
for you tonight, but please tune in next time
for celebrity political jeopardy where our

30
00:04:45,580 --> 00:05:12,160
guests will be Don Knotts, Malachi from children
of the corn, and Molly Ringwald. Be there!.

31
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:23,880
Okay you guys we are live in three. Three,
two ….

32
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,970
We're back.
We'd like to get serious for a moment and

33
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,900
remember our dear friend and political activist
Abbey Archer who passed away this week.

34
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,851
You are like clairvoyant and it's freaking
me out….

35
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:42,750
Tell me why you're opposing the prayer in
schools initiative.

36
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,610
Well uh first of all you have to understand
that there's a great many people who actually

37
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,271
believe that the world was created in seven
days because it says so in the bible. Now

38
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:57,410
my aunt Sadie on the other hand, bless her
soul, she was a devout Christian … she told

39
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,680
me that Jesus had apparently come to her in
a dream and Jesus clued her in that it was

40
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,400
actually Satan the great deceiver who had
written the bible in order to dupe people

41
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,820
into leading a life of sin all the while thinking
they were serving the lord.

42
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,580
That's brilliant.
Hey everyone's entitled to their opinion right

43
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,560
which is one of the great things about this
country. And the reason we're fighting the

44
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,380
initiative is a big part of keeping our freedom
of thought comes from separating church and

45
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,010
state.
Brilliant. Abbey Archer.

46
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,126
And finally we take you out to the grassy
knoll for our conspiracy of the week.

47
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:57,140
An ultra right-wing paramilitary group is
believed to be secretly assassinating political

48
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:07,577
activists with a microwave assassination device.
I’ll see you burn in hell for that.

49
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:30,000
No Frank no they did not move the furniture.
Yes they did. Komodo dragons.

50
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,740
Nobody moved the furniture. Guys that was
a great show. Abbey would’ve been proud.

51
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,030
How awesome was political jeopardy.
Oh man was that funny and with the Prozac

52
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,590
… Katie that was a great idea.
Hey Frank what's up with that conspiracy man.

53
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,370
Oh yeah I think that was a little over the
top.

54
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:56,180
A little over the top? Did the Indians get
blankets infected with smallpox? No, no it's

55
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,360
just the beginning. It's a postage stamp in
the bigger picture. The truth is that the

56
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,770
US government was blackmailed into giving
them the formula for the weapons version of

57
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,300
the device because they were threatening to
bring David Koresh out of hiding. He's alive.

58
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,120
Really?.
No shit.

59
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,980
There's a fine line between conspiracy and
insanity.

60
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,710
I saw that.
Can you explain the two Darrens on bewitched.

61
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,330
Guys, Natalie and I are going to nudestock
this weekend. Anybody want to go?.

62
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,860
Me … I want to go.
Going to be a nude dude. Frank?.

63
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,430
Um when is it going to be?.
Saturday … Saturday I have to work … I

64
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,370
have to work.
Katie?.

65
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,940
Um oh look you guys Eat Me’s on. No seriously
these kids are outrageous.

66
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,150
Caller, you there. Do you have a topic for
us.

67
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,840
Yeah. Why isn't the smart ass little kid in
school.

68
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,660
It's night time. School's over dumb shit.
So why don't you take your phone and stick

69
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,760
it up your ass.
Yeah eat me. Caller let's hear it.

70
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,250
I want to know how old you two are.
Listen Moses, you can take your age and stick

71
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,780
it up your ass!.
I love public access.

72
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:22,830
Wildlife is important for healthy forests
and wetlands which in turn provide us with

73
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,750
clean air and water.
Then why isn't the government doing more to

74
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,830
protect the environment?
Greed. The blind search for profit. And if

75
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,900
we don't do something about it now one day
soon we might be an endangered species. First

76
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,830
the corporate machine will build over our
forests, and then they'll pollute our food

77
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:47,380
and water, then we will all experience a slow
and agonizing death.

78
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:57,610
Hello Mrs Dickman.
Hello children. Ms. Wright I'd like to speak

79
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,550
with you.
Keep rehearsing guys.

80
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,000
People tell me that this play you're putting
on is heavy-handed.

81
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,220
Who who?.
That's not important. Also, parents are complaining

82
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,450
about your television show.
Who who?.

83
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:22,520
That's confidential. Just remember Ms. Wright,
we're watching you.

84
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,620
Why are we subjecting ourselves to this?.
It's only once a year. I mean even Hitler

85
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,810
had a birthday.
Actually Hitler did not have a birthday. He

86
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,420
was genetically engineered.
Who told you that?.

87
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,160
Frank.
Figures. Now you be good.

88
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:48,300
Door's open. Welcome to the house of the lord.

89
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:57,910
Mary, Mary, Mary, it is so nice to see you
my darling.

90
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,071
It's Natalie dad. You know that.
I believe on my birthday, in my house, I should

91
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:04,790
be allowed to call my daughter by her Christian
name.

92
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,700
Don't start with me dad.
What's new Mr. Wright?.

93
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,640
The lord's work is never done. There's always
something new young man. Come to my study

94
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,520
I'll tell you all about it. Dinner will be
served soon. Gerald wipe your feet.

95
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:28,170
My name is Jerry sir.
How nice for you. Oh you shouldn't have gotten

96
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:41,630
me … something so small. No that's very
charming. Thank you. Yes, yes, yes. Well,

97
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:49,560
wel,l well. Praise the lord. Gerald you know
I was once a young man like you.

98
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,300
That is hard to believe sir.
Gerald let me get right to the point. You've

99
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,540
been dating Mary for some two years now, I
thought it was time that we talked about her

100
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,120
future and whatever plans you might have together.
Well we're very interested in the future and

101
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,720
that's why we're working to make a difference.
Running an animal shelter and making home

102
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,910
videos with your pals doesn't exactly provide
the kind of security and wealth that my daughter

103
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,940
will require to raise a family.
Daddy I'm not a child.

104
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,529
I've been talking to my people and we thought
this would be an appropriate time to offer

105
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:29,490
you a position at my network.
Can we change the subject dad?.

106
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:37,060
Distilled water?.
Please.

107
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:44,220
Gerald?.
Sure.

108
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:51,360
So what have you two kids been up to lately?.
The funniest thing happened. Last weekend

109
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,790
we decided to do a piece for the show on this
festival ….

110
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:04,100
What?.
It wasn't that funny.

111
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,080
What are you hiding?.
I'm not hiding anything.

112
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:16,270
Then tell me what you did last weekend.
All right fine. We went to nude stock, the

113
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:23,900
all-nude festival, but it was so cold that
everyone had to wear clothes.

114
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:30,060
A school teacher cannot be seen at a nudie
carnival. This is a horrible example for children.

115
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,740
Does Mrs. Dickman know about this.
To hell with Mrs. Dickman, Natalie can do

116
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,810
what she wants on her own time.
Profanity is the language of Satan and Satan

117
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,610
does not dine in my house.
Well that's good because I heard Satan has

118
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,420
lousy tables.
Oh you make light of Satan. Satan’s wine

119
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,550
is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom
of asps.

120
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,990
You forced me to tell you the goddamn story.
Oh Mary that language will not be tolerated.

121
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,990
My name is not Mary. It’s Natalie for Christ’s
sakes after mom - not after some mythological

122
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,740
virgin. I lost my virginity at that bible
camp you sent me to when I was 12.

123
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,470
No! I won't listen to these lies. Leave now!.
Come on Jer.

124
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,059
It's been real,.

125
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,339
God help you, you will both surely rue this day.

126
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:34,690
Hello there. I'm Anita Deal and I am incredibly
excited to bring you this revolutionary tool

127
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:42,360
in perception. V-vision! Right now we're going
to meet the inventor of V-vision, Dr Veil.

128
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,270
Dr Veil if everybody already has a V chip
to filter out filthy programming in their

129
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,140
TVs why do they need these incredibly attractive
designer glasses.

130
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:03,140
Well Ms. Deal that's a very good question.
After years of extensive research at the Baktali

131
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,150
Institute of Technology of Research, we have
ascertained that most Americans don't watch

132
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:14,990
television 24 hours a day. Now we've created
V-vision and the way it works is that it blocks

133
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:23,580
out what's happening in everyday life … the
ghettos, the crime, and the criminals. And

134
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:31,670
what it does is instead of that you would
see a beautiful, peaceful and surreal images

135
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:39,130
that lull the viewer into a trance-like euphoric
state. You are a beautiful woman.

136
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,370
Oh! Now we're going to hear from some of our
incredibly satisfied customers.

137
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:52,340
Make love to me in the weirdest way.
Last week on my way to the market a dozen

138
00:15:52,340 --> 00:16:03,470
bums asked me for change. This week with V-vision
I can't see or hear any of them.

139
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:10,290
My neighbor is a homicidal maniac who used
to keep me up at night killing his victims.

140
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:17,020
But not anymore because I have V-vision and
it is helping me to block things out so I

141
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:23,320
can get the rest that I need.
It's like … this is bad … these are boss

142
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,080
specs.
Without V-vision you are faced with the poverty,

143
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,440
violence, and pornography of the world around
you. But put on a pair of V-vision designer

144
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:40,230
glasses and everything becomes clean and pure.
V-vision … using yesterday's ignorance to

145
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:47,736
shape tomorrow's world. Oh sheeba shabba looba
doo bah doo wah ….

146
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,319
Katie, what's going on?.
I didn't do that. I don't I don't know.

147
00:16:55,319 --> 00:17:01,913
Jerry, they're shutting us down.
What's going on.

148
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,000
You must leave immediately.
You can't get away with this you son of a

149
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,740
bitch.
How can you do this to your own daughter?.

150
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,170
You think you can silence us like this? You
think you can stop us?.

151
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:33,080
I am silencing you heathen. Thou shalt no
longer infect the minds of children against

152
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,940
everything this country stands for.
We are everything this country stands for

153
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,120
you jackass like freedom of speech, equality
before the law, the right to be who you want

154
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,090
to be.
If you do this dad I won't ever talk to you

155
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,750
again.
You are no longer my daughter Natalie. I disown

156
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,140
you. Disownership papers. You can leave now
or face arrest, and please take this band

157
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:04,280
of sinners with you.
Move out.

158
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,025
Everyone go limp.

159
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,590
Bobby, there's got to be something we can
do.

160
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm telling you guys it's vile, disgusting,
horrible, and violates all norms of civilized

161
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,710
society, but it is completely legal. Cable
companies are permitted to direct public access

162
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,920
stations to other uses if they are quote not
well utilized.

163
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,130
Capitalism run amok.
This is no coincidence. This guy wrote the

164
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,100
playbook for the new world order.
What about getting a new public access station.

165
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,740
Until the city finds another contractor we're
screwed.

166
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,010
When's that gonna be?.
Who knows? It's a bureaucracy. They specialize

167
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,850
in getting nothing done especially if there's
no public outcry. Anger is the only thing

168
00:18:53,850 --> 00:19:02,920
they respond to. I remember standing at the
barricades, facing down the man. We were united.

169
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:10,730
It had an impact. We made a difference.
That's it! We’ve got to get everybody from

170
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,570
the station to band together and we're going
to go down there and we're going to voice

171
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,260
our anger as one.

172
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,160
Oh Jerry this protest sucks! it's a joke!
We got no grassroots organization, no financial

173
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,309
backing, no direction, no nothing.
Do you have any idea what the chlorine gas

174
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,090
released from that tub does to the ozone layer?.
Listen up granola head. This is a free country.

175
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,090
Hey lady, why don't you stick a green thumb
up your ass.

176
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,640
There will be no freedom in this country as
long as we have bimbos like you perpetuating

177
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:52,660
female stereotypes that reek of sexual servitude
to a patriarchal society.

178
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,450
Go fuck yourself you feminazi.
You get out of the water!.

179
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,700
How long are you people on public access going
to allow yourselves to be the uncle toms of

180
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:28,770
the corporate media elite?.
Right now! Right now! You want some of this?.

181
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:35,020
Katie stop it.
Hey everybody it’s the press! Shut up!.

182
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,690
This party blows. I'm outta here.
Stick this protest up your ass.

183
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,640
Yeah eat me. Nice kick, Eddie.
Jer, you okay?.

184
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,070
I used to like that kid.

185
00:20:48,070 --> 00:21:07,590
Let’s go, Jer. We're just torturing ourselves.
We’ll get our message out.

186
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:13,970
The lord giveth and the lord taketh away.
Blessed be the powers of the lord.].

187
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:28,650
You're right, Natalie. We haven't gotten our
message out. We’re going to fight this thing.

188
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:44,480
We're gonna be heard if we have to take it
down the city hall.

189
00:21:44,480 --> 00:22:03,790
Well, well, well. If it isn’t the freak
show! Well you'll be happy to hear that I'm

190
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:10,630
filing the Reverend’s plans to upgrade Christian
Unity Network Television's newest station.

191
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:20,929
What a stupid bunch of losers. Why don’t
you do something with your lives. I am sick

192
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:31,510
of paying taxes so you lazy bums can sit around
all day playing counter culture. Get a job!

193
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:59,400
Have a family! Produce anything! Just get
out of my way. Maybe they’ll beat some sense

194
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
into you!.

195
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:13,309
This is just one day out of our lives.
Please just keep your voices down. They're

196
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:19,460
watching us. We’re under surveillance.
Jer, how the hell are we gonna get out of

197
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
here?.
Honey, Bobby will do something.

198
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:26,490
What if they've gotten to Bobby? What if Bobby's
been bought off? What if no one knows we're

199
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,460
in here? What if we never get out of here?.
This is the price that we pay for challenging

200
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,460
the tyranny of illegitimate authority.
Frank, we're gonna get out of here.

201
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,929
How do you know that?.
Cause we have to get out of here.

202
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:42,480
Frank mellow out. You're paranoid and you're
bumming everybody out.

203
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,970
Jerry you think I'm paranoid.
Frank you thought that Jerry Garcia was with

204
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,330
the DEA.
Yeah so?.

205
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,610
Frank you thought they were aiming a ray gun
into your bedroom window to make you weak

206
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:04,470
when you just had the flu.
I never get the flu. How do you explain that?.

207
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:11,270
Stop.
Hey I know you! You’re the TV guys. You’re

208
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:18,670
on that cable show..whaddaya call it? You’re
on right before those ‘stick it up your

209
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,470
ass’ kids, right?.
“Eat Me.”.

210
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:27,070
Fuck you. That’s not it. Your show is...
Anarchy TV.

211
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,970
That's it! I love your show. That special
report you did on the rubber gloves has definitely

212
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:38,960
saved me a disease or two. Oh and you have
that crazy guy with all the paranoid conspiracy

213
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
theories.
I’m not paranoid.

214
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:51,030
It’s him! It’s him! I love you. You are
the greatest.

215
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:55,590
First time in huh?.
Hey why don’t you take your hands off him.

216
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,280
Hey what's your fuckin’ problem, Joe!.
Guard!.

217
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,299
Buzz off Tiffany! I don't need your mouth.
Listen fat ass boy. I'm not scared of you.

218
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:09,100
Now let the nut go.
Stop, stop, stop, stop. The machine has us

219
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,679
fighting against each other. They love it
when we fight each other because when we fight

220
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,270
each other we're not fighting them. Can't
you see? They're watching us right now. They're

221
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:23,000
laughing at us. We're caged down here like
a bunch of animals. Look we don't even have

222
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,070
a toilet. Do you guys have toilet paper? The
ladies don't even have toilet paper. You know

223
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,390
what that is? That is cruel and unusual punishment.
Cruel and unusual punishment. You know what

224
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,610
cruel and unusual punishment means? Our eighth
amendment rights as American citizens are

225
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,549
being violated. Your eighth amendment rights
as an American citizen are being violated.

226
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:50,040
But rights are not just established by words.
No. They are won and they are sustained by

227
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,740
struggle, and right now we have got to struggle
together to get our freedom. We want our freedom

228
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,290
now. We want our freedom now! We want our
freedom now! We want our freedom now! We want

229
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:06,049
our freedom now! We want our freedom now!
We want our freedom now! .

230
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:21,500
You guys are going to be here a long time.
How do you know that? .

231
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,230
Enough Frank.
Do you have any idea how bad it smells in

232
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,440
there?.
I have the play at school.

233
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,790
Bobby, you couldn't dig the money up anywhere?.
I'll see what I can do, but Jerry all your

234
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:39,700
friends are broke including me. And Natalie's
father doesn't want to have anything to do

235
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,690
with her.
We're prepared to do whatever it takes, Bobby.

236
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:48,680
Have you tried the vet?.
Your bail’s been posted.

237
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,670
What?.
I posted your bail. You're free to go.

238
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,276
Really?.
Yes! You guys inspired me so much. Anyone

239
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:57,660
who can make that animal Joe stand up for
anything deserve my support. Besides I just

240
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,000
want to be on your show. I think you guys
are the greatest.

241
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:23,690
As soon as we get our show back you got it.
We get it back. Let's get out of here!.

242
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,710
All right!.

243
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:44,570
Here's to Tiffany.
Be careful with that, please.

244
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:53,840
What is this Frank?.
Oh um this is a uh miniature uh Spy Con … let

245
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:02,150
go I'll show you … Spy Con high fidelity
bug and tap detector with this super multiplexing

246
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:06,830
mil-spec cable descrambler.
Can you get cable?.

247
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:17,580
Sure, sure I can. I'll show you. Look out,
Jerry. Channels galore.

248
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:31,650
Wait, wait. Go back.
We can not sit back my friends while Satan’s

249
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,870
message devours ….
Turn it up!.

250
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,840
Change it!.
Honey I want to see what Mussolini’s broadcasting

251
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,760
from our station.
And we must not glamorize, no, we must not

252
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,580
celebrate the notion of pornography. I said
pornography, and I whisper pornography like

253
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:56,900
the dirty little shameful secret it is. Though
some would shout sodomy, some would shout

254
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:06,150
fornication, some shout pornography from the
little devil's box that we must eradicate

255
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,890
one channel at a time going click hallelujah,
click praise the lord, until the devil's message

256
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,730
is gone from our lives.
Just when he was getting to the good part.

257
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,059
I've had a lifetime of that crap, I can't
take any more.

258
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:20,390
What's going on?.
That's her father.

259
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,039
I'm sorry baby he's such an asshole.
Yeah he is.

260
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,750
You know in my day we wouldn't take this sitting
down.

261
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,510
Oh no, no, wait, wait. I just got out of jail.
I can't hear this.

262
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:36,660
No, no, no. We would organize. We would build
momentum. We would be deaf to their lies and

263
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,080
blind to their illusions. We would cut ourselves
free from the strings that jerk us like puppets

264
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,610
and we would create our own destiny. We would
achieve justice by all means necessary. By

265
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,610
all means necessary.
Right on man!.

266
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:55,750
I've got it. I got it.

267
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:13,460
Time to see what the good word is tonight.
You are watching God's station. Praise the

268
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,180
Lord. Hallelujah! And now for the Countdown
to Armageddon!.

269
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,539
This is the kind of television people want
to see.

270
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:29,810
Count your blessings and say your prayers,
because the times are changing, the signs

271
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:39,669
are there. It's plain as day I'm sure you'll
agree, that the world will soon be history.

272
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:59,080
What are you doing? We all agreed no guns.
Katie I’m so sorry. I fell.

273
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:09,500
What were you thinking?.
What if they shoot at us?

274
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:24,240
These are very dangerous people.
Then you get to die for the cause, Frank.

275
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,860
It’s just a scratch, Katie.
You guys still want to do this?.

276
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,980
Let’s do this.
Bingo.

277
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:55,950
Hey listen I don't know you, and I don't have
any gripe with you man, but I have been censored,

278
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,970
abused and imprisoned all because of your
boss and at this point I'm ready to blow this

279
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,880
place sky high so I suggest you leave right
now.

280
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:16,980
Jedi mind trick you will let us pass.
Buying that station was the best investment

281
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,570
I ever made.
Coming up next is the personal tale of revelation

282
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:30,000
that will forever change the way that you
look at your television set. For God's sakes

283
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,500
stay tuned.
Okay world you are watching Anarchy TV. We

284
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,310
are reclaiming this station to assert our
constitutional right to free speech. We start

285
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,679
broadcasting now. Power of the people!.
Harry what is this? Is this a joke? .

286
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,201
No this is no joke. Everybody just stay calm.
If you cooperate you will not be hurt. I want

287
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,580
everyone to make their way out to the lobby
right now. Come on preacher man.

288
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:59,600
I'm not going anywhere. I refuse to be intimidated
by every young person that straps some dynamite

289
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,370
to their chest.
Fine. Let's take them into the control room and tie him up.

290
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:11,560
Everybody else make your way out to the lobby.
Sweetheart you're in charge.

291
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,680
Let's redecorate.

292
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,430
Don't worry about it Reverend. We've got it
covered.

293
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,559
This must be kept quiet Chief Cochon. You
keep the police away.

294
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:25,809
You got it Reverend Wright.
And if anybody from the press calls stonewall

295
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:30,280
them. I don't want those little punks, those
delinquents to get one bit of attention.

296
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,030
Whatever you say Reverend.
All right. I'm glad I can count on a good

297
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:40,890
God-fearing man like yourself Chief.
Of course Reverend. And I look forward to

298
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:53,970
seeing you at the charity bake and bowl next
week.

299
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:59,200
Oh thank you goddess.

300
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,580
You are watching Anarchy TV. We have seized
control of this station to protest the sale

301
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:11,399
of our public access channel to a private
company. Without access to the means of communication

302
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,950
our constitutional right to free speech is
just an empty promise. We are going to hold

303
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:21,329
on to this station until public access TV
is rightfully restored to the people. We'll

304
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:25,759
be right back.
Sound volume's high and I'm losing the signal

305
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:34,940
on the remote feeds here.
I'm working on it Katie.

306
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:43,089
The people that control organized religions
don't want it known that the divine power

307
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:47,544
and the ultimate wisdom is not in a church
but inside each human being.

308
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:58,950
They bought it.
I told you they would. Suicide bomber costume’s

309
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,569
our biggest seller.
Is everything secure?

310
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:05,020
Jerry nothing's ever really secure.
That's good. You just put your paranoia to

311
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:08,023
good use.
I'm not paranoid.

312
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:34,710
I knew it!

313
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:47,989
Hi! I'm Reverend profit and I'm unbelievably
happy to see you. I've successfully started

314
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:53,569
over 25 religions and with my new home video
so can you. By the time you finish my course

315
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:56,980
you're going to think you're the big guy himself.
Should we get that mother?.

316
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,460
Harold, what would we do with our own religion?.
I'm going to show you how you can both write

317
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,109
and interpret scripture to suit your own needs,
and if you order right now I'm going to throw

318
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:13,170
in my own patented demonic adversary to explain
away any flaws in your belief system. It's

319
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,839
the best deal in the universe. Order now.

320
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:41,029
What's the situation Greed?.
Jerry you there?.

321
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:44,839
What's up, Frank?.
The Reverend has arrived.

322
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:53,589
They have implemented the emergency defense
system sir. That place is pretty much impregnable.

323
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:59,019
They're also broadcasting live. Oh yeah and
they're holding Mr. Arnold as a hostage.

324
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:04,630
All I know is God's station is not on the
air right now.

325
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:10,210
Probably, but they can't hear us. We didn't
get the mics operational yet.

326
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:16,450
What about the safe?.
100% secure. That is the same safe the desert

327
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,990
storm plans were held in at the NSA.

328
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:30,069
The men are in position to shut off the power
whenever you're ready sir.

329
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:35,109
Emergency power?
Doesn't matter. If the power goes off even

330
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:39,630
for a second the computer goes down and they
won't be able to transmit any signal.

331
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:54,869
Jerry they're going to cut the power. You’ve
got to meet me in the basement.

332
00:39:54,869 --> 00:40:09,339
Any second now sir.
Frank where are you?

333
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:12,940
Back here.
Ready sir.

334
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:18,519
Whenever you're ready, Reverend.
Okay you have to turn on the emergency power

335
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,339
at the exact same time that i turn off the
main power. You got it?

336
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:25,780
I got it.
On three.

337
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:42,150
Three two one .
Frank! You okay. Oh man I'm sorry buddy. Talk

338
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:48,390
to me Frank.
I know who had the Kennedys killed .

339
00:40:48,390 --> 00:41:03,420
We'll get them another way, Reverend.

340
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,989
How can you work for that guy Clarence? Do
you know anything about him? There has been

341
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:14,760
article after article written about how rotten
he is. He thinks that women are second-class

342
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:22,519
citizens. He thinks that homosexuals should
be executed. And he's a racist.

343
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,959
Doesn't that bother you? I mean you're an
African American.

344
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:29,319
What does the color of my skin have to do
with anything? If the Reverend was a racist,

345
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:34,289
he never would have hired me.
Oh, Clarence you cannot be that naïve.

346
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:37,440
Oh lord.

347
00:41:37,440 --> 00:42:00,289
Hi I'm Natalie. Here's your safe sex tip.
It is important to remember that when using

348
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:06,960
a dildo, one must treat it exactly like a
penis and put a condom on it. Especially when

349
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:14,599
it's used by multiple partners.
Turn that execration off. Take out the dish,

350
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,150
Greed.
We can’t sir. You had it fortified in case

351
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,630
the feds ever pulled a Waco on us. But their
power will run out in less than 24 hours so

352
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,109
all we have to do is wait.
Don't tell me to wait. Ollie told me you were

353
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:30,950
the best. I want them off my station now.
Yes sir.

354
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:35,049
All right love birds we are live in three.
Three, two…

355
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:38,660
Hi guys I figured I could be the most help
here with you two.

356
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,119
I'm sure you could be …
We are live you guys.

357
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,150
We already worked something out.
That's okay I'm great at improvising. Watch

358
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:57,299
this. Hi I'm Tiffany. I'm here with the cast
of Anarchy TV. We all met in jail. It was

359
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:01,809
my 18th bust for solicitation. Can you believe
prostitution is illegal? I thought this was

360
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:07,279
a capitalist country. If some horny bastard
wants to pay me a hundred bucks so he can

361
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:15,499
jerk off all over my face who the hell is
government to interfere in my business?

362
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:20,079
Right on! Absolutely right. Who are they to
interfere in her business? That's very … thank

363
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,709
you for the vivid introduction Tiffany. It's
true we didn't meet in jail. We were arrested

364
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:30,680
for protesting the elimination of our public
access to television. Right now we are looking

365
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:36,969
for your support. We want to know what you
are thinking about the importance of free

366
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:43,089
speech. Please give us a call at 555 oh one
69 and talk to us. Tell us what you think

367
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:48,390
of free speech. Call us.
We have a call.

368
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:52,739
Great go ahead. Caller hello.
Uh yeah I tried calling that number to order

369
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:57,999
the instructional video you advertised, but
I kept getting the suicide hotline.

370
00:43:57,999 --> 00:44:03,930
Oh, uh that was a parody.
They're taking a call sir.

371
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:14,730
They have callers. Turn it on.
The commercial was not real. We were making

372
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:20,329
fun of religious hucksters like Reverend Wright.
People who prey on poor unsuspecting folks.

373
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:25,349
Cut them off.
My wife and I both want to say that we think

374
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:33,999
Tiffany's doing a great job filling in for
Clarence.

375
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:40,729
Hello caller. Hello.
The phones are dead.

376
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:45,369
Frank where are you man. Frank, Frank, you
there? The phone's dead man.

377
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:46,920
Yeah Jerry. Give me a minute and I'll patch
in my cell phone.

378
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,380
Okay cool.
Boy that Frank is good. He could steal the

379
00:44:50,380 --> 00:45:11,089
cherry from a 90 year old nun.
Let's go to tape.

380
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:18,690
I'm Sorely Reefer and sitting across from
me is the Unabonger, a man who has been terrorizing

381
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:27,960
DEA agents by sending them filthy bongs resulting
in a mandatory five-year prison sentence for

382
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:37,269
receiving drug paraphernalia in the mail.
Unabonger, tell me, when all the smoke clears,

383
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:41,190
what do you want to have happen.
Well Regis, I want people to realize that

384
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:49,140
the war on drugs is not a war on drugs, it's
a war on people. That's what I want.

385
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:55,030
But aren't you in the process violating and
victimizing innocent people?

386
00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:02,260
Why yes I am Regis, but desperate times they
call for desperate measures. Did you know

387
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:09,569
that over 1,000 people a day are arrested
on marijuana charges, 80 percent of those

388
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:15,530
are for possession alone. There are people
serving life sentences. There are over a hundred

389
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:23,959
people on death row for pot. For pot. Pot.
It's insane Regis.

390
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:31,140
My name is Sorely.
Mr. Unabonger, what would make you consider

391
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:37,559
ending your campaign.
I would I would have to … I don't remember.

392
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:44,329
I don't remember. Would you like the best
cookie you have ever had?

393
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:49,709
No I would not like a cookie and I cannot
accept anything from a known felon. I am a

394
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:57,920
professional reporter.
They are scrumptious. My wife is Amish. Oh

395
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:09,539
yes. Oh yes. I am the cookie man people of
earth.

396
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:21,039
Hello I'm Candy Looney and I think that we
should take the idiot who invented the child

397
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:28,530
proof lighter, tie him to a stake, and then
let him starve to death while we try to light

398
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,609
him on fire with his goddamn contraption.
I mean these child-proof lighters they make

399
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:39,440
me so angry. I can light the American flag
on fire. I mean this makes me so angry I’ll

400
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,940
light my bra on fire.
Jerry you look really pretty in a dress.

401
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:50,069
Bobby, hi. Where is everybody? There's nobody
here. Where are the cops? Where's the press?

402
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:55,319
Nobody even wants to bust us?
I don't understand it, Jer. I've called everybody.

403
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:01,029
Maybe Frank was right. Maybe there is a big
media conspiracy. Maybe nobody gives a damn.

404
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:04,459
What are the ratings?
What are the ratings man?

405
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:09,049
Well if that was an EKG we'd be dead.
Maybe you better call Dr Kevorkian.

406
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:13,690
And let him know we got less than 20 hours
of power left.

407
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:22,240
I heard that. Look I’ll work on it and get
back to you. Try to think of something to

408
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,240
get some attention.
Later man.

409
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Later.
What'd Bobby say?

410
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,650
He's got no idea.
I do. Clearly this is coming down from central

411
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:30,559
command Jerry.
Frank please not now. Please.

412
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,849
Okay. I'm sorry. The Reverend was really worried
about that safe, Jerry. There's something

413
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:42,749
in there. I know it.
Can you get it open.

414
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:48,119
Yes. It's going to take a few hours. It's
very heavy duty stuff. Used by all the big

415
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,130
boys. I mean it's incredible Jerry. They've
got everything. They're ready for Armageddon

416
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:57,009
in here.
You're doing a great job, man, a great job.

417
00:48:57,009 --> 00:49:02,490
Thanks.
Can you give me a little volume on this?

418
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:09,150
Our operators are standing by we won't start
the revolution without you. Come on guys we

419
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:15,130
need your help. We need you to become involved.
We have a new number. Frank's loaned us his

420
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:20,309
cellular it is 917-555-0101.
Did you hear that, Tiff.

421
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:21,460
Yes.
917

422
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,609
917
555

423
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:23,760
555
0101

424
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,510
0101

425
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:38,099
want to call us, call us and tell us why you
don't want to call us.

426
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:42,549
We have a call.
Ah. Hello caller are you there?

427
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:46,420
Who’s this?
This is Anarchy TV who's this?

428
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:53,789
This is your mother Frank stop it with the
impersonations already. I'm not the FBI. Come

429
00:49:53,789 --> 00:50:01,229
on Frankie I need your help. I'm hearing those
voices in my head again. I need you to come

430
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:05,579
over and sleep with me tonight.
Boy he’s kinky too.

431
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:10,589
She's doing it to me again. Just like the
fifth grade.

432
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:18,829
Mrs Corder, I'm not Frank. I'm Frank's friend.
He loaned us his phone for the show. We're

433
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:24,099
live on the air.
Well then put Frank on.

434
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:30,619
Things are really kind of crazy right now.
Missy, I am not crazy. I want to speak to

435
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:33,690
my Frankie.
Mrs. Corder you wait right there. Frank's

436
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,759
gonna call you okay.
At least their ratings are no better than

437
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:45,779
ours, Reverend. Let's just hope they keep
this guy's mother on the line all night.

438
00:50:45,779 --> 00:50:52,799
What about tomorrow, Greed? What about tomorrow?

439
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:59,510
Well now it's nine minutes after the hour,
and I'm wondering where you are America. What

440
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:06,390
happened to the spirit of revolution? You
know give me liberty or give me death. Having

441
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:19,230
the right to speak your mind freely that's
the very foundation of democracy. I need you

442
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:26,459
to call me. I need to know that you care.
You guys we have a call.

443
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:33,319
We have a call.
Is it Frank's mom again?

444
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,861
Go ahead, caller.
Jerry it's me Bobby.

445
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:38,930
Bobby. Katie can we go to tape.
Go ahead Bobby.

446
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:48,269
No complaint has been filed with the police.
As far as the press goes the Reverend has

447
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:52,619
apparently told him that you're an experimental
program to promote the Christian Unity Network's

448
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:57,650
new youth missionary movement.
You're kidding right.

449
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:10,940
No fucking way.
He's putting us in the missionary position.

450
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:16,430
Welcome to cross burning. Today we debate
the allocation of penal resources. More people

451
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:21,640
are behind bars in America than in any other
country in the world. Is it a new growth industry

452
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:28,930
or just another huge welfare program? Joining
us today are on the left Duke David, and on

453
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:37,709
the right Lenny Speer. Duke you're first.
Thank you, ma’am. Let me tell you a little

454
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:47,900
story. Prisons are like another big brother.
An expensive government handout to the scum

455
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:54,249
of America. Now when I think of America, I
think of the cream of the crop the cream that

456
00:52:54,249 --> 00:53:00,539
rises to the top and that cream is white.
Let me tell you something else. It's time

457
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:06,670
those people started paying their way. We
could have an army of worker slaves that make

458
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:14,119
them goddamn Chinese green with envy. I'm
talking about making them make everything.

459
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:17,420
Think of the profits. Pie in the sky-high
profits.

460
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:24,130
Duke, Duke, Duke. You’re such a bleeding
heart liberal. Haven't we learned our lesson.

461
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:33,339
Concentration camps never work. To engineer
the perfect society, the solution is always

462
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:38,299
extermination.
Let's go to commercial.

463
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:51,180
Fucking machine ripped me off again. Sid,
change please. Anybody have any change.

464
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,599
Sorry Katie.
I'm starving.

465
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:05,700
I could use some food.
Yeah I'm starving too. Open it Frank. You

466
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:20,039
could steal a turd outta my ass and I wouldn't
even know it.

467
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,140
Property is theft.
Christ we're off the air.

468
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,859
Who's on tape control?
Shit, that's me. Sorry.

469
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:30,410
What's the point? Nobody's watching.
Why don't you lighten up Katie.

470
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:33,640
You know I'm not gonna listen to you and nobody
else is.

471
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:39,569
Stop it. Stop it. We’ve dealt with bad ratings
before. Come on guys. Why did we take over

472
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:43,170
the station? It’s something that we all
agreed on. You know we wanted to question

473
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:47,690
authority, we wanted to challenge injustice,
we wanted to take a stand, we wanted to expose

474
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:52,430
the naked truth.
Yeah! If we all went to naked we'd get some

475
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:58,279
serious ratings.
Uh Tiffany, hi. Thank you. It's about liberation

476
00:54:58,279 --> 00:55:02,390
not exploitation.
Katie, nudity doesn't necessarily involve

477
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:06,219
exploitation. There's nothing shameful about
the naked body.

478
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,270
Yeah, it's a first amendment issue. It's like
our safe sex tips.

479
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,749
All rights guys. Let's do it.
You can't be serious.

480
00:55:12,749 --> 00:55:18,470
We can't go naked. Nobody gets to see me naked.
I've never seen me naked. No naked.

481
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:22,180
I bet you look great, Frank.
How could you advocate selling out to the

482
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:27,319
methods of mainstream media manipulation?
Whoa nude anarchists. Stop the presses. I

483
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:32,359
wonder what they have to say? Who cares? They're
naked.

484
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:36,239
Right.
Katie, we have no time. Nobody's watching.

485
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:39,849
It's not what we planned, but it is a revolutionary
statement. What would you do to get people

486
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:41,690
to watch?
Yeah Tiffany's right. We have got to do something

487
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,710
to just get people's attention.
Fuck it.

488
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:48,900
She's got balls.
Jerry do something.

489
00:55:48,900 --> 00:56:01,739
It's totally voluntary. Sid fire up the cameras.
We’re going live.

490
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:12,259
Oh my God. Are they gone?
Yeah they're gone.

491
00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:15,759
Oh my God.

492
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:27,189
Sir, sir, sir. Sir, I think you need to see
this.

493
00:56:27,189 --> 00:56:38,349
As you can see we’ve decided to give you
the naked truth. Uncensored. I think it was

494
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:40,660
Mark Twain who said “Nature knows no indecency.
Man invents them.”

495
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,160
Let this be just another nightmare.
Mother, these people are naked.

496
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,329
No they're not.
Their headlights are on high beam.

497
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:54,589
Women in those cultures are forced to wear
veils. In America nudity is considered obscene

498
00:56:54,589 --> 00:57:01,069
which is just as selective of behavior.
The Reverend sure has taken this station in

499
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:12,789
a new direction.
Hey, get out of the way.

500
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:19,579
We were all born naked into the world, and
it's only a warped, puritan ideology that

501
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:27,849
tells people that their natural form is in
some way obscene. Shame is just another tool

502
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:38,449
that is used to control who you think.
Hey guys Tiffany's on television. Holy shit,

503
00:57:38,449 --> 00:57:44,410
they’re naked!
Ultimately it's about freedom and it's about

504
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:50,209
liberty.
Yes it is Jer.

505
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:59,499
Great.
Right.

506
00:57:59,499 --> 00:58:08,380
We are really tense our energy is low we need
to exercise, and I just happen to be a certified

507
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,960
aerobics instructor.
What is she doing?

508
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,510
I don't know.
Come on guys I'm telling you. You will feel

509
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:22,059
great. Sid crank up the music!
All right Tiffany.

510
00:58:22,059 --> 00:58:27,999
No. Go back. Go back.
Come on guys. Come on get over here.

511
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:30,040
What is she doing?
It's called aerobics and yeah do it to get

512
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:37,329
fit. I need to get that switched.
Come on guys!

513
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:46,400
Come on, let’s go out there. Seriously,
let’s do it.

514
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:57,289
Are you high?
Please feel free to join us home. You will

515
00:58:57,289 --> 00:59:12,729
feel great. Go ahead. Just take all your clothes
off and start moving. You will feel great.

516
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:17,799
Finally entertainment for the entire family.
Would you look how quickly the revolution

517
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:22,299
is co-opted. Now we're being led by a naked
aerobics instructor.

518
00:59:22,299 --> 00:59:31,769
Katie, if a revolution falls in the forest
and no one hears it, is it still a revolution?

519
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:40,170
Yes it is Sid. It is a pure revolution. It
is a revolution with meaning and values. Not

520
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:44,079
this.
Let's give it some meaning. Let's use a blue

521
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:49,729
screen and we'll key in some political images
and whatever we have. Let's just find something

522
00:59:49,729 --> 01:00:19,890
crazy.
I cannot believe I’m doing this.

523
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:56,759
You see how much better that is. Clarence,
you like that don't you?

524
01:00:56,759 --> 01:00:57,759
What are you doing mother?
Oh…

525
01:00:57,759 --> 01:01:02,880
Look out! You’ll poke your eye out.
It’s wonderful. Wonderful. Freedom. Freedom.

526
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:09,809
You sure can cut a rug mother.
Yes Milton I had one of my famous chats with

527
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:14,520
her. That's right. Sometimes teachers just
need to be made aware of the influence that

528
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:21,579
they have on children. That's right. Okay
well don't worry about it we won't be having

529
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:54,359
any more problems with her. All right now.
Bye-bye. Christ!

530
01:01:54,359 --> 01:02:19,029
The last flight of the nut bird. Hey.
Officer Sweitzer, how can I help you? Uh-huh.

531
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:27,609
Naked people on your TV. Why didn't you just
turn

532
01:02:27,609 --> 01:02:31,400
the channel? Uh-huh. All right. Yeah. We're
on it.

533
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,209
What?
Some wacko says his daughter got possessed

534
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:40,549
by satanic messages from naked people on TV.
What channel?

535
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:50,189
Channel 169.
This footage reminds me of how fragile our

536
01:02:50,189 --> 01:02:55,109
freedoms really are in this society. I mean
if this can happen to you at any time or at

537
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:56,979
any place how can you say that you're truly
free.

538
01:02:56,979 --> 01:03:16,209
What the fuck is this?
This is Anarchy TV. Are you guys dancing out

539
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,939
there?

540
01:03:18,939 --> 01:03:22,950
Hi I'm Susannah smart and I'm coming to you
live from outside the studios of channel 96

541
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:37,859
where a naked religious cult has seized control
of the station in protest of poor cable service.

542
01:03:37,859 --> 01:04:06,690
Jerry it's show time.
Look at that.

543
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:34,009
This is great.
Okay.

544
01:04:34,009 --> 01:04:40,479
You should never underestimate the power of
nudity, Katie.

545
01:04:40,479 --> 01:04:50,989
Excuse me officer, I'd like to drive through.
I'm the attorney for the group that's taken

546
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:58,819
over the station.
Out of the car slowjam. Do it!

547
01:04:58,819 --> 01:05:06,439
What are you talking about? I’m the lawyer
for the guys inside the station.

548
01:05:06,439 --> 01:05:11,670
Out of the car midnight. Don't make me use
this. Do it!

549
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:15,239
You're interfering with the most important
act of civil disobedience since the levitating

550
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:17,439
of the pentagon.

551
01:05:17,439 --> 01:05:30,449
Lord, why hast thou forsaken me.
Reverend is it true that a revolutionary group

552
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:34,039
called Anarchy TV has taken control of your
station and taken hostages?

553
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:38,170
Yes unfortunately that is true. These heathens
have stolen my station in order to spread

554
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:42,190
their doctrine of pornographic filth.
Let's see what the coverage is like.

555
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:46,490
…broadcasting an experimental program to
promote the Christian Unity Network's new

556
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:49,099
youth missionary movement. What about that
Reverend?

557
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:51,819
No, that's ridiculous.
Well maybe this tape will jog your memory.

558
01:05:51,819 --> 01:05:54,900
Reverend, Is it true that your daughter is
one of the people in there?

559
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,470
I don't have a daughter.

560
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:04,759
This just in. We have obtained exclusive footage
of the naked protesters who have taken over

561
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:06,980
channel 69.
Why isn't she naked?

562
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:12,210
Be advised, some of this footage might not
be suitable for children and sensitive viewers.

563
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:17,739
And now for the real news.
The government is stealing from you the corporations

564
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:21,509
are poisoning you and the media are lying
to you.

565
01:06:21,509 --> 01:06:22,640
And now for the weather.

566
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:37,250
What is going on Cochon?
There was nothing I could do Reverend.

567
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:59,199
Well do something now. Look at those animals
parading naked on God's station.

568
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:36,759
We think it's a serious commentary on the
state of the media when you realize that we

569
01:07:36,759 --> 01:07:40,959
took over this station last night and nobody
noticed until we took our clothes off and

570
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:44,450
now the whole world is tuning in.
We have a call from someone who claims to

571
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:49,160
be the police chief Jerry.
The police chief. Cool. Okay. I'm sure he's

572
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,539
his own man speaks his own mind. Put him through.
Hello.

573
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:54,190
Who am I speaking with?
Who am I speaking with?

574
01:07:54,190 --> 01:08:01,099
This is police Chief Cochon, and I'm calling
to ascertain exactly what your demands are.

575
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:06,890
Well chief my name is Jerry, this is Natalie,
this is Tiffany. You're live on Anarchy TV,

576
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:11,660
and our demands are that a public access station
be made available to all the people, and we

577
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:16,009
want that in writing.
We want some pizza.

578
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:37,960
And we want to talk to our lawyer.
This type of fascist behavior will not intimidate

579
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:49,350
me. Nor will it weaken my resolve to confront.
And expose the abuse of power.

580
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:54,600
Things aren't going your way. I mean sometimes
the world can appear to be a really cruel

581
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,820
and unfair place.
Stop pandering to those little punks. They're

582
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:06,000
terrorists. Can't you see that? They're like
plagues of locusts. Listen to me you godless

583
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:14,350
heathens. You cannot steal God's station.
You will not spew forth venomous, vile, lewd,

584
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,600
licentious smut and get away with it.
Jerry we're gonna take the TV news signal

585
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,549
and go split screen with you and the Reverend.
Cool. Do it.

586
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:28,120
I'll get the camera.
Listen world. This guy is a greedy hate monger

587
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:33,510
who uses a religious veil to hide a multi-million
dollar business and propaganda machine designed

588
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:39,839
to enrich him at our expense. He disseminates
messages of hate. He shows a rampant disregard

589
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,799
for the poor in the downtrodden, and he was
an abusive father to the woman that I love,

590
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:48,319
Natalie.
You represent a failed counter culture society,

591
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:54,360
an ideology that has been responsible for
sexual disease, drug addiction, the decay

592
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:01,650
of the American family, the callous disregard
for the aged, for the unborn, and ultimately

593
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:08,270
it is you who will be responsible for the
moral decay of this great nation, the promotion

594
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:13,860
and the glorification of Satan.
There is no failed counter-culture ideology.

595
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:18,580
What there is is a group of greedy and selfish
individuals who have no regard for their fellow

596
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:22,720
human beings or the planet that we all live
on. People like you who promote a view of

597
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,810
the world in which we are all pitted against
each other in some kind of pathetic race for

598
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:31,130
profit and power. You know you're the one
who's immoral you are the one who glorifies

599
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:34,390
evil. With people like you taking over the
airwaves we might as well all just destroy

600
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:39,640
our TV sets. What's the point of having one?
You profit by painting a picture of the world

601
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,340
in which danger lurks behind every corner
and we are all powerless to make the world

602
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,000
a better place.

603
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,340
Poppa, what is he saying?
He has a good point, Mother.

604
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:56,620
The fact is that you think that freedom and
democracy are threats to be avoided and not

605
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:59,860
values to be preserved. That's the saddest
part.

606
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,860
Jerry!
What?

607
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:04,320
It's all true. It's all true. Everything.
Exactly like I said.

608
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,220
Frank I'm live. Please.
No Jerry! The microwave assassination device.

609
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:12,910
Exactly like I said. The victims, the operatives
for the Christian Supremacy Movement.

610
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,560
This is not the time for a conspiracy theory,
Frank.

611
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:21,560
This is not a theory. I got it out of the
safe. The Reverend's safe. Look Abbey’s

612
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:32,311
name is on the top of the list.

613
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:33,311
You can't be serious.
Jerry?

614
01:11:33,311 --> 01:11:39,270
What?
You’ve got to let me take this out there.

615
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:46,340
This is big. This is the summit of the mountain
I've been climbing my whole life. You gotta.

616
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:59,340
Okay. Go ahead. Frank is going to give evidence
that implicates Reverend right with this unbelievable

617
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:02,280
weapon.
Jeez.

618
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:10,380
It's lies. It's all lies.
This has gone too far shut him down now.

619
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,980
Relax Reverend they're gonna run out of power
soon enough.

620
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,440
Don’t talk back to me. What do you think
I pay you for?

621
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:21,020
We can't go in there. The place is barricaded,
and they have a hostage.

622
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:27,060
Oh I don't give a soggy shit about that little
fuckhead, faggot, jungle bunny.

623
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:31,820
Oh my God.
See, I told you that guy was an evil son of

624
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:32,820
a bitch.
Katie, now is not the time. Clarence, we’re

625
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:33,820
going to untie you.

626
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:41,400
Hey Reverend take a pass! Stick this station
up your ass! Hey Reverend take a pass! Stick

627
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,340
this station up your ass! Hey Reverend take
a pass! Stick this station up your ass! Hey

628
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:52,110
Reverend take a pass! Stick this station up
your ass!

629
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:58,330
…because of their political beliefs. Because
they disagree with you. People who are trying

630
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:05,690
to make the world a better place.

631
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:29,100
Here's your happy juice, sir.
No. I don't want my medicine now. I want justice.

632
01:13:29,100 --> 01:14:17,970
I want a pox on their homes.
Don't worry Reverend, you're gonna feel better

633
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:32,940
in a minute.
I hope so.

634
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:45,480
Stop him. Somebody stop him!

635
01:14:45,480 --> 01:15:11,480
By violating my rights, you're participating
in your own oppression. Every time you silence

636
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,270
another voice, your own freedom of expression
is diminished.

637
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:23,460
Shut up! I don't need a lecture from you Mr.
Moon Cricket. Society pays me to rid the scum

638
01:15:23,460 --> 01:16:18,240
like you off this planet. Okay. All right.
Hey that guy's throwing money. They’re throwing

639
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:23,140
money.

640
01:16:23,140 --> 01:17:07,260
Good morning world!
Atta boy, Frank. Way to go!

641
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:29,020
We kicked their ass! We got proof!
I’ll shoot your ass!

642
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,020
He’s got a gun!
Heathen!

643
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,020
I missed his dick.

644
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,020
What happened?
You got shot. You got shot. You're going to

645
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,050
be all right. Just hang in there. Just hang
in there. You're going to be alright. Don't

646
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:36,560
touch it. Don't touch it.
What the hell. He got me.

647
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,520
Call an ambulance!
Where's the ambulance!

648
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:57,150
This proves it. This proves everything.

649
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:02,951
Rotten machine.

650
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:25,918
C’mon. Give me a hand. Put your shoulder
to it.

651
01:18:55,278 --> 01:18:57,584
Hey where's the paramedic!
Where’s the medic?

652
01:18:57,584 --> 01:18:58,584
No! No medic!
Why not?

653
01:18:58,584 --> 01:18:59,584
No medic. Don't you leave me alone with them.
Why not?

654
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:04,527
That's when they implant the chip.

655
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:24,009
Jerry this is not a real ambulance and those
are not real medics.
