2
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:20,500
You want a mirror?

3
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,900
Nate?

4
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:21,883
Yes

5
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,506
In what are you thinking?

6
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,277
That stray dog ??that usually hang around here.

7
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:30,714
've Called animal control about fifteen times.

8
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:34,274
Promise me food when I go away.

9
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,358
Do not want no bum.

10
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,274
When you get back I'll get you a real dog.

11
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:39,664
In the pet store.

12
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:45,523
What?

13
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:48,313
Maybe I should let them do it.

14
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:51,527
Look, when you look at the recruiter,
will know that you are serious.

15
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,927
Are you sure about this, right?

16
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,799
When you are ready.

17
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:47,869
I think I am.

18
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:51,379
When you are sure tells me to stand up.

19
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,237
Very good. Stand up!

20
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:55,876
Hurry up!

21
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:56,626
Do not tell!

22
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:58,524
Faster!

23
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,790
My boy from the army.

24
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:10,123
Damn!

25
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:13,063
The book only tells you what to do if you do not want a boy.

26
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,460
I do not think it matters.

27
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,170
O God! If I got pregnant and a girl is gonna be so screwed!

28
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:20,782
You came up, right?

29
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:22,746
Do not feel?

30
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:27,948
Perhaps we should try again before they come home.

31
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:28,305
Trish...

32
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:30,630
I think I need a little time, ok?

33
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,415
You'll never be alone, dear. Never!

34
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:34,985
Do not forget that.

35
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:37,081
I know you're nervous, ok?

36
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:40,645
And I know that sounds like a great thing,
but deep down it is not!

37
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:44,435
Do not forget that, dear.
It's just a small world.

38
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:52,613
I can not find my shoes.
I'll be late.

39
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:16,244
BMG

40
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:18,553
Hello! Mark Dessau, please.

41
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:21,122
Who are you talking about?

42
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:21,702
Nobody!

43
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,847
What?
I considered calling my father before leaving, that's it!

44
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,298
He never even sent you a birthday card.

45
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:30,491
Why do you think he cares that you are going to recruit?

46
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,583
I thought that maybe he could finally meet him...

47
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,366
try to move on with my life ahead.

48
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:34,616
Why?

49
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:35,287
To tell you what?

50
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:38,218
You used to repair cars until you give up?

51
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:43,248
Or that you pulled back from school
Community because you could not take it easy?

52
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:53,144
Look...

53
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:53,842
just...

54
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:57,138
wait until you leave the house your mother.

55
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,731
Wait until you get something on your own.

56
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:04,530
Then call him and appeared to him in uniform
and he will be sorry to have you abandoned.

57
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:04,990
You think?

58
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:12,929
If you connect to your father as
you think your mother will feel Nate?

59
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:56,258
Nathan!

60
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:03,795
Would make a decent breakfast.

61
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:07,721
Well at least I got you this parting gift.

62
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,496
'd Send you wrap, but...

63
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:14,676
but had no time to do it all
Cute as they do at the mall.

64
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:19,924
It's plastic?

65
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,258
It's barbecue on July 4.
Remember?

66
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:26,049
Rays. I look so fat there.

67
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:28,269
The period and some margarita.

68
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:29,028
I love it!

69
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:36,325
Would give you an empty frame and
let you put the picture you wanted, but...

70
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:38,135
Everyone knows that.

71
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,012
I have all my photos here.

72
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:40,822
Yeah, well...

73
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:46,366
I thought that you would help
remember what is important and for which he fights.

74
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:47,696
I love mom!
Really.

75
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:48,878
Thanks.

76
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,535
C'mon then.

77
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:03,555
Let's do not want to start
melt on my uniform.

78
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,615
You have your bags made?

79
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:20,668
So...

80
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,876
whom shall I call when my car breaks down?

81
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,527
Gene's better than me on this, he helps her.

82
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:28,927
Yeah!

83
00:09:29,518 --> 00:09:31,028
If you do not die tomorrow.

84
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:32,874
Hey Gene!

85
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:37,023
If you want to ride to the clinic
you'll have to put deodorant!

86
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,223
I will not have a pig in the car!

87
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:45,233
Poor crazy, drink up and near death
calls it post-traumatic disorientation.

88
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:46,866
Maybe.

89
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:48,089
Yeah, right!

90
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,239
Whatever.

91
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:55,138
I can not afford to lose a
tenant with a monthly annuity check.

92
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,178
God! Do not want to end this way.

93
00:09:58,442 --> 00:09:58,782
Yes

94
00:10:00,402 --> 00:10:01,562
It will be difficult.

95
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,412
And you'll want to quit.

96
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:06,092
But only do your best darling.

97
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:08,398
I'm scared.

98
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:09,793
Sure you are.

99
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:11,221
Sure you are.

100
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:11,681
But...

101
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:12,458
no...

102
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:16,494
Do not say it out loud, or people get to know.

103
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:19,555
They'll think you're a coward.

104
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:26,275
Nate, I think the recruiter has arrived!

105
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:43,547
Today is the big day, huh?

106
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,251
You should be nervous, eh?

107
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,549
I remember when I went to training camp.

108
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,853
The first thing I did was get a hooker.

109
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:54,763
I do not need a bitch, I'm Trish.

110
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,520
Are you going to Camp Edelton?

111
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,860
I will.

112
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:00,707
And after training at Twilight Palms.

113
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:02,567
I'm still not sure.

114
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,370
Twilight Palms I've been on for years.

115
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:07,510
There was not much to do there but drink and fuck.

116
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,462
Despite being a good unit.

117
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:10,707
Do not forget the ring I want.

118
00:11:10,707 --> 00:11:11,952
It is part of the romantic journey.

119
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:13,774
I want white gold, do not forget, white gold.

120
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:14,593
OK, I spare.

121
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:15,624
Save or steal, I do not care.

122
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,279
Send a photo so you take a.

123
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,009
I will not believe it when I see my son in uniform.

124
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,742
- Hello
- Hello

125
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:23,636
Ready to go?

126
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:23,976
Yes!

127
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:25,119
You have the right paperwork?

128
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:25,579
Yes.

129
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:26,625
Yes, sir.

130
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,085
Come on.

131
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:31,308
My God!

132
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:38,466
So?

133
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,103
Will you work tonight?

134
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:41,783
Yes, in the dining room.

135
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:45,702
They were put to me there on Sunday!

136
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,220
It's called seniority Trish!

137
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:51,354
God!

138
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,356
Why do I feel like
if going to war?

139
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:05,756
Andy!

140
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:08,365
Sorry.

141
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:09,276
I just...

142
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,312
I was thinking.

143
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,994
You're not going to die, okay?

144
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,829
You're going to an exclusive meeting.

145
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:15,799
And you will not paint the eyes!

146
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,859
Will not you come here to look the Angel of Death!

147
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:19,549
I like!

148
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:22,349
Yes, you sleep with it,
or wash with a shower.

149
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:23,519
It's confusing.

150
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:24,682
I am.

151
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,810
Do not try to be very unique. OK?

152
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:33,154
This is the side of the picture with you without it.

153
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:34,767
Where you met this guy?

154
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:39,367
Look... if he likes you,
will treat you like you're somebody.

155
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:41,647
Sophisticated!

156
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,101
Limit yourself to two martinis.

157
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,751
You told her about Travis?

158
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:46,781
Of course not!

159
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:47,730
Neither shalt thou count.

160
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,243
Would he like you. Right?

161
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,790
I have not even met him.

162
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,310
Andy...

163
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,130
you said you were ready to walk through life.

164
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,060
I'm ready!

165
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,090
Great!

166
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:59,098
Not chased him with your details depressing.

167
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:40,969
So what are you doing Andy?

168
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,628
I go to Palm Springs soon to a chore.

169
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:46,078
What kind of chore?

170
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,749
I'm not sure.
But it seems easy money.

171
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:51,786
I need to leave the apartment of Chris.

172
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:54,913
I think he's tired that I sleep on the couch anywhere.

173
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:56,073
I like to travel.

174
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:57,561
See the world.

175
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:59,398
I will arrange a used car

176
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,608
and starting to see the universe.

177
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,905
And what prevents you?

178
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:07,326
I never wanted to do alone.

179
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,629
You can not go indefinitely without a plan.

180
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:17,505
You will not get anywhere.

181
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:18,845
The dolphins do.

182
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:22,576
They have a complex internal system of sonar and

183
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:24,650
use it to guide yourself around the world.

184
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,230
Gave that program...

185
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:29,185
How do you do?

186
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:30,766
How do I do what?

187
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,676
Tell them who's your mother.

188
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:38,347
His mother is Louise Strong, the actress.

189
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,849
Where is the bathroom?

190
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,517
What do you think?

191
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,965
Alan, sorry about...

192
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:36,466
I thought...

193
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,181
How is his body?

194
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,610
Andy!

195
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:40,616
Andy!

196
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:42,979
Let's pool.

197
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,305
I have a swimsuit.

198
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:44,995
I have!

199
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,473
And it suits me?

200
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,035
I have several sizes upstairs.

201
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:52,185
At the end of the corridor on the left.

202
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,624
Andy, you do not need a bathing suit.

203
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:56,819
It was you who said to be sophisticated.

204
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,459
Sophisticated and fun.

205
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:02,694
Do not let anyone
without flirting a bit.

206
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:49,773
- Hello
- Hello

207
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:51,223
You'll enter the water?

208
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:52,478
I do not know.

209
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,036
Dolphins go.

210
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:57,838
You know, I think I found ourselves before.

211
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,643
I was on the phone,

212
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,099
you were nervous.

213
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:03,891
You need a belt?

214
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:09,360
I think Chris had good
intentions to try to join us.

215
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,723
But I'm not the kind of boy
trophy of the party, if that is what you seek.

216
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,873
I'm not as shallow as I look.

217
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,426
Your eyes were so sad.

218
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:28,101
You need someone special.

219
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:30,474
I had someone special.

220
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:32,291
Poor romantic.

221
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:34,916
So it did not work?

222
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,824
Not the way I expected.

223
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,689
How am I compared to?

224
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,340
You're different.

225
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,440
He had no money.

226
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:51,317
It was just a Marine.

227
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:52,003
Age?

228
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:57,637
It seems that the rule is:
once a Marine, always a Marine.

229
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:03,085
Sorry.

230
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,030
The fault is not yours.

231
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:07,348
It was recent?

232
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,756
The last time I saw him...

233
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,204
God! I can not remember anything!

234
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,720
I lose track of time.
Have I ever done?

235
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:23,267
I do not remember nothing happened...

236
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,064
to 4 minutes or 4 years.

237
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,187
No, not really.

238
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:31,666
Well ..

239
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:34,417
we know,

240
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,102
Of course we know-mos.

241
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:41,194
It's just one of those
rare coincidence, I think, where...

242
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:42,764
make things click.

243
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:50,340
The last time I saw him, you just
remaining few days in town, so....

244
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,509
the last time we were together in a hotel junk.

245
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,609
A hostel of a star.

246
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,856
And we made plans.

247
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:01,195
For traveling, a dog, kids.

248
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,980
You know, our family.

249
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:09,516
And when we were together that night...

250
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:12,006
knew so well, because...

251
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:13,466
... he was special.

252
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:23,827
I could try to describe it...

253
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:25,209
Beautiful;

254
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:26,883
Wonderful;

255
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:28,990
Amazing;

256
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:32,152
Unbelievable what happened between us.

257
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:35,237
It was like...

258
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,434
we were able to

259
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,989
close the door to the world.

260
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:49,908
You know, I have this feeling...

261
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:53,535
When I left, I could...

262
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,335
see you at the corner of the eye.

263
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:58,997
He was there.

264
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:06,473
I swear that I supervised all
my dreams in one direction...

265
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:09,313
and he turned and went to the other side.

266
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:11,243
Never seen him?

267
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,613
Sometimes I can see it.

268
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,758
More or less.

269
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:23,305
Small fragments in my mind.

270
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,390
I wish I could review it.

271
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:38,649
Wished there was a
way to go back and relive everything.

272
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:41,532
So maybe

273
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:47,054
I could be prepared for what happened.

274
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:48,979
And do not take these...

275
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,211
Able to overcome.

276
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:19,643
Sorry.

277
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,416
Can not seem to overcome.

278
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:29,475
Chris?

279
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:33,532
Chris?

280
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:54,601
Hey, sorry for...

281
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:56,152
It was my fault.
Gotta go.

282
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:58,956
God! Rid yourself of guilt!
Not attractive.

283
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:01,590
You know, I think this is no place for me.

284
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,720
Tell Chris I will not need to return to his couch.

285
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:07,423
You are so lost!

286
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:48,065
Hey! You look lost.

287
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:59,945
I hear there is an old drive-in
on the road, I thought to get going but...

288
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:00,582
Let me guess...

289
00:23:00,582 --> 00:23:01,812
Marines. Right?

290
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:03,462
Yes, in basic training.

291
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:06,437
They do the basics in 29 Palm.

292
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:07,776
Long story.

293
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,466
It is forever.

294
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:13,816
Hopefully things are of
always find a way and another.

295
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15,578
Tell me something...

296
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:17,164
bus passes through here?

297
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,260
You do not need the bus.
I give him a ride.

298
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,720
Come in.

299
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:23,656
Carpe Diem eh?

300
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,671
Yes, it was my idea of u200bu200bthe bride.

301
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:30,017
She says I need to commit myself to more things.

302
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:30,477
Bride?

303
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:32,238
When will marry?

304
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:36,684
Actually, that's why I will be the city because
want to buy an engagement ring, before going home.

305
00:23:36,684 --> 00:23:39,254
Saved enough money for an engagement ring?

306
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:40,718
It says something about you.

307
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:44,038
The announcement says that balances meeting in the city.

308
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:46,027
And you believed them?

309
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:48,674
The jewelers are always asking for half the head.

310
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:49,304
Really?

311
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:50,448
Yes

312
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:53,974
But I have an idea of u200bu200bhow to earn extra money.

313
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,194
To purchase this alliance.

314
00:23:55,194 --> 00:23:56,124
Come in. Come on.

315
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,730
Get in the car.

316
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,494
Nice car.

317
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:08,134
Thanks.

318
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,600
Let's go.

319
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,579
Home Sweet Home!
Come in.

320
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,312
Want a drink?
A red wine or something else?

321
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:36,402
My mother drinks red wine.

322
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:39,245
Here you go.

323
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,877
I need to sign it.

324
00:24:40,877 --> 00:24:41,927
Thank you.

325
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:46,894
What is this?

326
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:49,082
Just, you know...

327
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:51,357
give me your permission, blah, blah, blah...

328
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,378
who has over 18 years...

329
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:55,131
in the event of federal
appear asking for your identification.

330
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:57,599
If I do not have it, I end up in jail to take in the ass,

331
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,525
Believe me. I have been there!

332
00:24:59,525 --> 00:25:01,495
Not as sexy as it sounds.

333
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:03,625
He has arrived.

334
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,195
Sit down, I come back.

335
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:12,693
It looks good.

336
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:14,486
The hair is longer than the photo, but...

337
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:15,126
work.

338
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:17,844
How much do I pay for this?

339
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:19,130
How much are you worth?

340
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,994
I do not know. Never did anything like that.

341
00:25:20,994 --> 00:25:21,754
Five hundred?

342
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:23,405
Five hundred?

343
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:25,489
It pulled a bit eh?

344
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,509
I have to send money to my mother.

345
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:30,463
She is taking care of some things for me.

346
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:34,662
I gotta tell you...
lots of people do more for less.

347
00:25:34,662 --> 00:25:35,603
Andy...
Nate.

348
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:36,583
Nate...
Andy.

349
00:25:37,742 --> 00:25:38,082
Hello

350
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:55,736
So...

351
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,531
what type of model we are doing exactly?

352
00:26:01,863 --> 00:26:02,383
Model?

353
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:07,969
Right. Let me ask you a few
questions so they know you a little.

354
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,106
Who are "they"?

355
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:10,086
Who sees it.

356
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,625
To be more interested in you.

357
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:16,722
You sure do not want a beer?

358
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,270
Where is the bathroom?

359
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:18,700
Ali!

360
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:21,077
Hurry!

361
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:23,629
Well done!

362
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,860
Fuck!

363
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,691
So where are you Andy?

364
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:38,207
Hollywood!

365
00:26:38,883 --> 00:26:40,333
Who's Hollywood?

366
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:40,908
I.

367
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,243
But I'll go.

368
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,725
That's my plan.

369
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:46,305
Uhhhh! Running away from home.

370
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:48,035
Running away from home?

371
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:49,235
Just...

372
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:52,961
looking for my vocation.
I think.

373
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:53,956
Yes! It happens.

374
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:57,375
One day you open your eyes and you'll be ahead of you.

375
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,475
I hope so.

376
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,839
Will be!
Sure.

377
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:03,038
It happened to me.

378
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:05,014
Different cases, right?

379
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,250
And I should know!

380
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:10,148
Why do not you undress?

381
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:29,812
Stop!
I like!

382
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,049
Straight or gay porno?

383
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,640
Sorry?

384
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:37,732
No matter.

385
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:39,450
I find a movie for you.
Are all equal.

386
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,480
You know... this is not for me.

387
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:42,163
Hey! Where you going?

388
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:43,428
Sorry!
I do not...

389
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,197
Gotta go.

390
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:44,877
What's happening?
Listen...

391
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:45,516
is nothing special.

392
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:46,971
Do not have to touch each other,

393
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:49,131
just playing with yourself.

394
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:51,041
Do not have to touch each other.

395
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,201
This is not cool.

396
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:54,380
Why do not you go
swim in the pool a bit?

397
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,700
I'll get a cigarette and I climb.

398
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:04,989
Fuck!

399
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:26,944
Travis!

400
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,490
Travis!

401
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:30,205
Travis!

402
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:38,094
Tag!

403
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,370
Does not sound too good.

404
00:28:47,323 --> 00:28:50,483
It was a real lab when I bought it.

405
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:52,670
I should have listened to my mother, of course.

406
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,187
Would take a look?

407
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:55,567
I just want to get out of here.

408
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,667
Yes, I too.

409
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:01,701
Well done!

410
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:10,685
OK, try now!

411
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:21,976
Do you hear that?
It's my good karma to offset.

412
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,620
I think that is your starter.

413
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,900
Want to go riding?

414
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:26,739
Where?

415
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:29,395
If I take it off again?

416
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:30,756
Can skate a little.

417
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:33,617
Breaded not want to be on the road alone.

418
00:29:33,617 --> 00:29:34,717
Where you going?

419
00:29:34,987 --> 00:29:36,668
To my mother's house in Los Angeles.

420
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:38,758
My house is on the road.

421
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:39,535
Join!

422
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:21,708
You'll be okay?

423
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,526
Yes, I am spending a season at home

424
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:26,686
then I have combat training.

425
00:30:26,977 --> 00:30:28,437
And then embark on me.

426
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:31,678
And do you think it good?

427
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:33,931
It was not exactly my idea.

428
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:36,731
But you have to keep things, okay?

429
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,894
No. I mean,
you have no problems with the war?

430
00:30:40,894 --> 00:30:42,804
For me it's just a job.

431
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:45,238
And I need a job.

432
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:46,073
God!

433
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:50,213
There was nothing you could do?

434
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:52,603
A family business or similar?

435
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,568
I thought to be mechanical.

436
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:58,044
Open a repair shop.

437
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:00,414
But my fiancee and my mother,

438
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:03,838
say there is no future in car repair.

439
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:09,206
It seems to me that you have many responsibilities, soldier.

440
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:11,567
This is what I seek.

441
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:15,602
So greet my mother,
go back to the road.

442
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:16,662
Permanently.

443
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,802
Where are you going?

444
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:24,168
I start by Joshua Tree,
and go from there.

445
00:31:24,168 --> 00:31:25,438
Follow what then?

446
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:26,727
I do not know.

447
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:28,527
I just want to go away.

448
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:33,144
It is as if we were tied to the material world.

449
00:31:33,144 --> 00:31:35,694
But, but what kind of world is it?

450
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:39,735
Look at your face.

451
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:42,755
See?

452
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:45,637
The infinite!

453
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,390
Stop whenever you want.

454
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,906
You do not want your girlfriend sees you?

455
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:14,072
Better to be surprised.
Even if it's just me.

456
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,622
It seems to me a lot.

457
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:19,803
Ok, so...

458
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:22,367
do not forget to go to a mechanic.

459
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:23,177
I'll try.

460
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:27,387
Good luck with a. .. Joshua Tree.

461
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:30,931
Good luck with your war.

462
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:16,304
Monta me Davey!

463
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:17,623
Mount Me!

464
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:18,667
I'll come!

465
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:29,545
Damn!

466
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:35,850
Trish.

467
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,500
Nate?

468
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:38,310
Yeah baby, I am.
Let me enter.

469
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,090
Where is the key?

470
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,175
What are you doing here?
Said he'd be tomorrow.

471
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:43,385
What? Would come back later?

472
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:53,954
You're kidding me??

473
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:55,124
Get out of here!

474
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:56,689
Fuck this!

475
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:38,956
Are you okay?

476
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,404
What happened to your girl?

477
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,929
My boy came home early!

478
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:09,549
Where are you been?

479
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,050
Did you see the carrot cake in the refrigerator?
It's your favorite.

480
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,018
I knew it!

481
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:24,997
Did you know?

482
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:28,400
Yes Nate. It is too
old for you anyway,

483
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,304
you need be a new decent girl.

484
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,454
But it was you who join us.

485
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:34,699
She seemed like a good girl at work.

486
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,461
How could I
guess that she was with everyone?

487
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:38,331
With everyone??

488
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:42,646
Yes! She closed the bar every
nights since you went away.

489
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:47,158
Even gave a name to a drink
her honor, called the Bride of War.

490
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,138
I never should have enlisted.

491
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:53,232
So what are you gonna do?
Give up?

492
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:54,906
You think I give up?

493
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,197
How do I know?

494
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:02,918
You know, this is your father speaking.

495
00:36:02,918 --> 00:36:07,788
No, it's not! My father has his
company itself is not a quitter.

496
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:12,171
How did you find the Mark?

497
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:15,936
I do not know. You used to write him e. ..

498
00:36:15,936 --> 00:36:18,422
to tell your friends how he abandoned us, so...

499
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:20,872
I remembered his name and tried.

500
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,605
Why do not you want me to meet my father?

501
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:34,255
Nathan, if you call this man, I
swear to God I never talk to you!

502
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,867
Because you sent out?

503
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:02,628
Yes! But the frame is good.

504
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:05,372
See?

505
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:07,711
A new beginning.

506
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:11,544
You think you do pick up again?

507
00:37:11,544 --> 00:37:14,703
Busy to talk to himself.
Wacko of lightning!

508
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:16,733
However it's good with cars.

509
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,090
You're back!

510
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,150
What's happening?

511
00:37:23,647 --> 00:37:24,571
The war is over?

512
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:25,551
Not for me.

513
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,377
The car of my friend has a problem
on startup, maybe something else.

514
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,742
Pu him walk, but needed that you saw it.

515
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:33,722
Is parked on the street, okay?

516
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:35,577
I can not pay much.

517
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:38,418
No! You give him some money when it's gone.

518
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:40,635
Otherwise it goes to the bar drinking.

519
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:43,025
Can I have it ready in a few two days.

520
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,360
Two days?

521
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,718
After tomorrow Gene.

522
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,081
Okay.

523
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:56,253
I can not stay here so long,
gotta go have my mother's house.

524
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:58,139
Alright! I give you a ride.

525
00:37:58,139 --> 00:37:59,359
Let's get outta here.

526
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,189
Think you can tell that he arrange the car?

527
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:05,939
Depends. If you feel like working on it will fix it.

528
00:38:13,743 --> 00:38:15,250
Thanks again for the ride.

529
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,410
No problem.

530
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:20,061
I heard you discuss with your mother.

531
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:24,592
I think you should call your father.

532
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:27,753
What do you think?

533
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:31,999
Do not be afraid of your mother.

534
00:38:32,758 --> 00:38:34,208
I'm not afraid of it.

535
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:36,663
Just do not want to bother.

536
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:40,396
If you can go jump into the middle of a
war zone within a few weeks,

537
00:38:40,396 --> 00:38:42,869
I think I deserve the right to connect to your own father,

538
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:46,289
and let him know what's going on with your life.

539
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,504
Call him!

540
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,194
Okay!

541
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:49,641
I'll call.

542
00:38:52,022 --> 00:38:52,662
Damn!

543
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:05,296
BNB

544
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,996
Hello, Mark Dessau, please.

545
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:10,718
Nate is Merrith... Nathan Merrith.

546
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:14,018
Yes, I would schedule a meeting.

547
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:15,404
Tomorrow?

548
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:17,829
Thanks.

549
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:22,646
See?

550
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:26,260
You are not happy to have done?

551
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,420
What happened?

552
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:31,671
Make an appointment to see your father tomorrow.

553
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:34,951
Scored.

554
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:36,658
How do you feel?

555
00:39:38,732 --> 00:39:40,422
As a kid scared.

556
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:45,734
Travis...

557
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:51,115
Grandma explains that pairs cry for news.

558
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,202
Want some more medicine?

559
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:00,514
Thanks.

560
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,455
I have to tell you something about my mother,

561
00:40:06,455 --> 00:40:07,495
she is very...

562
00:40:09,214 --> 00:40:10,704
What?
It's what?

563
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:25,694
My God!

564
00:40:25,694 --> 00:40:26,974
I waited and waited!

565
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,379
I expected you sooner.
Why did not you used the key?

566
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:31,349
I have the key.

567
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:32,269
Who is this?

568
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:35,645
My car broke down.
Nathan gave me a ride.

569
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:38,222
Look, I cleaned your room...

570
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:40,791
Where's Travis?

571
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:55,542
This is splendid.

572
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:57,576
It is very good.

573
00:40:59,011 --> 00:41:00,291
I love red wine.

574
00:41:01,013 --> 00:41:03,963
It is the only one who does not give me headaches.

575
00:41:08,024 --> 00:41:09,034
I love your house!

576
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:09,674
Thank you.

577
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:12,672
It is no longer what it was.

578
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,198
When I met Andy and his father
this house for years, I remember thinking:

579
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:17,848
Endless Possibilities!

580
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:20,416
Of course Andy said, "Infinity".

581
00:41:22,172 --> 00:41:24,579
Andy's father and I were starting, and

582
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,246
I was so proud.

583
00:41:26,246 --> 00:41:29,926
A direct me to this house in a stylish black car.

584
00:41:33,713 --> 00:41:34,643
This car...

585
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:38,924
clear that I understood...

586
00:41:40,474 --> 00:41:43,011
he was not exactly
the man I thought you were.

587
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:44,474
Andy does not remember this,

588
00:41:44,474 --> 00:41:46,072
but when he was young,

589
00:41:46,072 --> 00:41:47,373
before his father died,

590
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:48,748
he used to smoke in front of all...

591
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:49,266
Louise!

592
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:49,896
What?

593
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:51,645
Would compliment you.

594
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,137
About how tough you are.

595
00:41:58,189 --> 00:41:59,625
How are tough.

596
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,195
O God!

597
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:02,549
Tylock that sounded...

598
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:05,559
show that I did...

599
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:07,468
I can not remember anything.

600
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,120
Andy, as called the show?

601
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,164
Remember? The one where I created,
and there was this boy...

602
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:12,854
And then?

603
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:14,745
So you're an actress?

604
00:42:16,063 --> 00:42:17,393
Never leave home.

605
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:21,001
How can I go if I have Travis?

606
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:23,788
Left the house before Travis.

607
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,118
I will not argue in front of others.

608
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,545
I suggest that...

609
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,128
accept our differences.

610
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:36,881
You...

611
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:38,964
're careless.

612
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,960
You are a person with no worries.

613
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,101
And I'd rather stay home.

614
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:52,857
Who brought the groceries, Mom?

615
00:42:52,857 --> 00:42:56,023
When was the last time someone
asked him how he spent the day?

616
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:56,773
Good idea.

617
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,542
I go to a shooting,

618
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:01,229
and thou...

619
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,861
'll take care of Travis.

620
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,640
Andrew?

621
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:08,953
What Louise?

622
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,561
Your child needs a bath.

623
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:20,513
What is this?

624
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:21,740
What is this?

625
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,770
What is this?

626
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:34,020
When you said your mother took care of things
for you did not think you had been talking about a baby.

627
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,000
With your son.

628
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,916
I hope he takes care
him a little longer, until...

629
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:40,716
Until what?

630
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:43,908
I think we should stay here tonight.

631
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:45,712
I do not want to drag behind me.

632
00:43:45,712 --> 00:43:47,502
Sure.
Okay.

633
00:43:48,982 --> 00:43:50,482
Where do I sleep?

634
00:43:52,243 --> 00:43:54,213
My room is at the bottom.

635
00:44:19,636 --> 00:44:20,749
He is so polite.

636
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:21,559
And attractive.

637
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:23,291
It's your boyfriend?

638
00:44:23,638 --> 00:44:24,813
My car is being repaired,

639
00:44:24,813 --> 00:44:26,511
and when ready I'll look for work

640
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:27,759
and I'll bring some money.

641
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:30,455
Not gonna leave me again,
as you walk around.

642
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:34,131
The Travis is your responsibility,
I can not, sorry...

643
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:35,634
Why not make a movie?

644
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:36,504
No! Wait!

645
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:38,945
Stay with me.

646
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:43,341
I undo your boxes and
You can go back to school.

647
00:44:43,341 --> 00:44:45,141
This is what we like.

648
00:44:45,578 --> 00:44:47,148
It can also stay.

649
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:49,354
What are you doing?

650
00:45:00,423 --> 00:45:01,813
I was putting it in the cradle.

651
00:45:02,745 --> 00:45:04,425
He will not stay here?

652
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,880
Do not want to change her habits.

653
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:12,548
You can get the bed,
I sleep on the floor.

654
00:45:12,548 --> 00:45:13,445
No. Okay.

655
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,485
Could you please share?

656
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:20,831
No. What I meant is that
I do not mind sleeping on the floor.

657
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:46,510
So...

658
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:48,277
where is the mother?

659
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:50,654
It's an excellent question.

660
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:53,497
Have you been sick?

661
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:55,121
Barely knew her.

662
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,488
I went to picnic with a friend...

663
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,447
some tequila, a spectacle of fireworks,

664
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:03,137
is easy to get confused.

665
00:46:09,674 --> 00:46:11,654
I'm a little confused.

666
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:12,786
About what?

667
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:19,771
I'm trying to understand you.

668
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:23,368
What are you trying to figure out?

669
00:46:26,024 --> 00:46:28,864
I think I have nothing to do with it.

670
00:46:30,818 --> 00:46:33,078
Unless you want to be.

671
00:47:16,882 --> 00:47:18,982
I wrapped the book about babies.

672
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:20,266
What book about babies?

673
00:47:20,266 --> 00:47:22,035
The book she left things with him.

674
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:25,406
It also wrapped up some old toys Blackie.

675
00:47:25,406 --> 00:47:27,994
Why dog u200bu200bwrapped toys for a baby?

676
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:29,334
A toy is a toy.

677
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:29,497
Dear...

678
00:47:29,497 --> 00:47:31,098
- This thing is broken?
- How do I know?

679
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,855
Honey, do not forget the food.

680
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:34,346
You must ensure that he eats.

681
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:38,509
He likes cookies, but in moderation,
you do not want him to have stomach pains.

682
00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:39,559
What are you doing?

683
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:40,691
You hear me?

684
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,469
Do not want to give you stomach pains.
What are you doing?

685
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:44,000
- Where is Nate?
- What are you doing?

686
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,299
- He is a mechanic...
- I'm mechanics, like any other,

687
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:47,225
I'll try.

688
00:47:47,225 --> 00:47:47,758
Dear out there!

689
00:47:47,758 --> 00:47:50,200
- Why can not remain so?
- I do not know! I do not know! I do not know!

690
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,300
But I'll try.

691
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,583
So attractive in that uniform!

692
00:48:14,112 --> 00:48:15,512
Why so upstanding?

693
00:48:15,586 --> 00:48:18,556
Will meet his father for the first time today.

694
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:21,888
What do you think?

695
00:48:25,773 --> 00:48:28,513
I think he'll be very proud.

696
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:39,504
Please be informed if problems arise.

697
00:48:39,802 --> 00:48:40,672
Please...

698
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:44,427
Please play after you.
I died for concern.

699
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:47,807
Do not worry so much.
Why worry so much?

700
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:52,125
You'll find out.

701
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:54,609
Sooner than what you think.

702
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,440
Be careful with you.

703
00:48:59,029 --> 00:48:59,839
I love you.

704
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:52,401
It is now.

705
00:49:53,635 --> 00:49:54,625
Deep breath.

706
00:49:56,154 --> 00:49:57,743
What do you think he'll think of me?

707
00:49:57,743 --> 00:49:58,733
You will love thee!

708
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:00,054
You think?

709
00:50:00,669 --> 00:50:02,979
Look at you.
Who would not?

710
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:10,008
If you take a long time back.

711
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:12,658
Hey!

712
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:14,076
Good luck!

713
00:50:15,034 --> 00:50:16,954
It is a very brave thing.

714
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:26,059
There is food in his bag.

715
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,349
You should feed him.

716
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:28,099
Yes

717
00:50:34,843 --> 00:50:37,513
This thing is like Pandora's Box!

718
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:44,046
What is this?

719
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:48,338
The ridicule of my mother
thinking that my son is a dog.

720
00:50:49,683 --> 00:50:50,953
Vai. I'm fine.

721
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:02,143
OK!

722
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:23,172
Fuck!

723
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:30,979
I know.

724
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:32,797
It was a coincidence.

725
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:36,778
I know!

726
00:51:37,467 --> 00:51:38,277
It was like...

727
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:40,159
Hello

728
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:41,727
Nathan Merrith.

729
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,102
An hour is too early?

730
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,799
Okay.

731
00:51:51,035 --> 00:51:52,479
He is ready to receive it.

732
00:51:52,479 --> 00:51:52,939
Now?

733
00:51:54,168 --> 00:51:55,618
Only spent a minute.

734
00:52:01,656 --> 00:52:02,696
Are you okay?

735
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:13,837
So?

736
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:16,748
You are the son of Debbie Merrith?

737
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:21,439
The name!

738
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:25,205
Merrith! It took me awhile to remember me, but...

739
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:27,199
How is she?

740
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:28,754
Working hard.

741
00:53:28,754 --> 00:53:31,094
One feature that did not.

742
00:53:31,266 --> 00:53:31,606
Yes

743
00:53:32,105 --> 00:53:33,615
Always the same thing.

744
00:53:33,996 --> 00:53:35,476
Do not want to sit?

745
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:35,936
I want to.

746
00:53:38,138 --> 00:53:40,588
I can not believe that Thou art.

747
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:44,642
The last time I saw you had...

748
00:53:44,642 --> 00:53:46,562
Yes, I've spent a long time.

749
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:48,471
And now...

750
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:50,465
you are a U.S. Marine?

751
00:53:50,465 --> 00:53:51,275
Yes sir.

752
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,454
My wife and I were...

753
00:53:53,454 --> 00:53:55,084
big fans of the war.

754
00:53:56,115 --> 00:53:56,880
She's pretty.

755
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,800
It's an actress.

756
00:53:58,845 --> 00:54:00,005
Want children.

757
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:03,136
Have not told you yet about the vasectomy.

758
00:54:03,136 --> 00:54:06,816
I thought of keeping it for the paper anniversary.

759
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,616
She knows about me?

760
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:15,663
You know what about you?

761
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:19,355
- I told him?
- He said what?

762
00:54:21,881 --> 00:54:23,921
I told him I had a son?

763
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:29,652
What?

764
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:34,939
I told him I had a son?

765
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:37,777
Because you say so?

766
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,098
Because I'm your son.

767
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,559
You're my father!

768
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,670
You are my father, right?

769
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:58,588
Well ..

770
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:05,657
What's so funny?

771
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:06,545
I do not...

772
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,486
Who told you that?

773
00:55:10,451 --> 00:55:11,951
Who said what?

774
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:15,741
I was your...
Listen, I'm not your father!

775
00:55:16,975 --> 00:55:19,077
- You're not my father?
- No.

776
00:55:19,077 --> 00:55:22,037
Debbie you already had when I met her.

777
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:31,287
So if you is not...

778
00:55:33,425 --> 00:55:34,532
She never told me.

779
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:35,267
I do not know.

780
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:38,127
I thought it was some kind.

781
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,410
You know, you should...

782
00:55:40,544 --> 00:55:43,044
check at the bar, there are many kinds out there.

783
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:43,734
Okay.

784
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:45,822
Sorry to bother you.

785
00:55:45,822 --> 00:55:48,212
I regret very much for this Justin.

786
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:49,629
It's Nate!

787
00:55:50,187 --> 00:55:51,817
Right!
Nate... Merrith.

788
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,022
<i>Will love you.</i>

789
00:56:43,926 --> 00:56:46,196
<i>She'll think you're a coward.</i>

790
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:15,245
What happened to the uniform?

791
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:17,105
What the devil are you doing?

792
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,545
Do not you hear the cry?

793
00:57:18,545 --> 00:57:20,528
Accidentally locked the car.
You have the keys.

794
00:57:20,528 --> 00:57:21,698
You're unbelievable!

795
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:25,742
He was hungry. I would try to find milk.

796
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:26,948
There is food in the car!

797
00:57:26,948 --> 00:57:29,545
Andy, your mother made the bag
is even in the backseat.

798
00:57:29,545 --> 00:57:31,840
I could not open the damn bottle.

799
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,633
You can not let a kid closed.
in the car with the windows closed.

800
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:35,950
I opened the sun roof.

801
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,765
Oh My God!
It is a human being not a dog!

802
00:57:38,765 --> 00:57:40,445
Think you do not know that?

803
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:41,448
It's my son.

804
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:43,315
So act like his father.

805
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:44,473
Do not worry about it.

806
00:57:44,473 --> 00:57:46,213
We're sorry! Because you are.

807
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:48,843
What the devil happened there?

808
00:57:48,843 --> 00:57:49,713
Ohhh! Come on!

809
00:57:50,669 --> 00:57:51,419
Where?

810
00:57:51,956 --> 00:57:54,056
Through hell, where are we going?

811
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:09,438
He suggested that I look
the son of a bitch from the bar!

812
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:11,905
I can not believe it!

813
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:14,258
But...

814
00:58:15,381 --> 00:58:16,551
you told me...

815
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:21,765
Who is referred to as
father on Birth Certificate?

816
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:22,345
Nobody.

817
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:24,667
She had no one by that?

818
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,697
There is law?

819
00:58:25,912 --> 00:58:29,494
No, she does not have to by one
rather, it is not law.

820
00:58:29,494 --> 00:58:30,604
So you lied.

821
00:58:30,826 --> 00:58:33,206
If I wanted to know,
I have...

822
00:58:34,805 --> 00:58:35,445
Sorry.

823
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:37,987
You do not have that.

824
00:58:41,093 --> 00:58:43,523
Just wanted to know who is my father.

825
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:49,025
To me it seems to me that you have
know who is your mother.

826
00:58:54,312 --> 00:58:55,882
I always had this...

827
00:58:55,981 --> 00:58:57,781
image of who he was.

828
00:58:59,296 --> 00:59:01,456
You have to abandon this image.

829
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,065
Quit.

830
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:06,083
That's what I try to do.

831
00:59:07,149 --> 00:59:07,909
Obviously.

832
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,400
Please!

833
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:14,121
It's not as if I had left
Travis in a container or similar.

834
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:16,292
Was in a car outside a school.

835
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:18,092
She always wanted a son.

836
00:59:18,274 --> 00:59:20,264
It would really leave him?

837
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:27,588
And if I carry it with me and something happens to you?

838
00:59:29,123 --> 00:59:32,953
I have no idea what I'm doing with my life.

839
00:59:33,126 --> 00:59:34,990
I have no purpose.

840
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:36,440
You know, I am nothing!

841
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:38,874
Until I find that demon on this planet,

842
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:41,204
discover what is my vocation,

843
00:59:44,695 --> 00:59:45,625
Jesus Christ!

844
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,470
He agreed.

845
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,200
Give me my pipe in my suitcase?

846
00:59:56,657 --> 00:59:57,832
Pipe? You're kidding, right?

847
00:59:57,832 --> 00:59:58,872
I'll get.

848
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:02,050
I follow this path,

849
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:05,005
do not do anything that is not totally natural.

850
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:06,745
Even in front of your baby?

851
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:10,501
I hope the smoke will keep you asleep all night.

852
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,837
Probably hungry again.

853
01:00:12,837 --> 01:00:14,347
No. .. not now have,

854
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:16,725
but will have soon.

855
01:00:19,308 --> 01:00:22,498
What is it? Babies enjoy herbs do not like?

856
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,190
Help me open.

857
01:00:32,768 --> 01:00:34,638
I must have loosened it before.

858
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:37,586
I think he likes carrots.

859
01:00:47,775 --> 01:00:49,275
It's a kid so cute.

860
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,200
You have not seen anything yet.

861
01:00:53,128 --> 01:00:55,978
He seems to like me, does not it?

862
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:58,960
Some carrots?

863
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,039
When I was a kid there were...

864
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:03,199
lots of kids in my neighborhood.

865
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:07,901
They moved everyone, but I think to study.

866
01:01:08,104 --> 01:01:09,784
I did not go very far.

867
01:01:12,443 --> 01:01:13,433
You changed you.

868
01:01:13,748 --> 01:01:15,078
No, not really.

869
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:19,344
I wonder where they went all.

870
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:22,637
You know, as they arranged the courage to...

871
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,567
leave and sailed alone.

872
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:29,429
Maybe you should come with me.

873
01:01:32,185 --> 01:01:33,805
Are you serious?

874
01:01:34,918 --> 01:01:36,198
Well, was not...

875
01:01:37,449 --> 01:01:38,959
to hear me say it.

876
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:40,335
I did not care.

877
01:01:40,335 --> 01:01:41,855
We get along quite well.

878
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:42,737
Yes

879
01:01:44,487 --> 01:01:46,407
I think I'm a wall.

880
01:01:47,226 --> 01:01:49,726
Breaking the law, starting with the wind.

881
01:01:49,735 --> 01:01:51,503
Could you help me with it
I need someone.

882
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:52,423
Yes, I know.

883
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,579
I wonder what would happen if I...

884
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:03,979
leave everything behind.

885
01:02:04,374 --> 01:02:04,774
Everything?

886
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:08,739
What you leave behind?

887
01:02:11,624 --> 01:02:13,374
It's an excellent question.

888
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,058
A clean start.

889
01:02:18,453 --> 01:02:20,103
Endless Possibilities.

890
01:02:23,185 --> 01:02:23,825
Infinity.

891
01:05:53,431 --> 01:05:53,771
Hello

892
01:05:54,432 --> 01:05:55,422
Want to join?

893
01:05:57,884 --> 01:05:58,694
Look, I...

894
01:05:58,894 --> 01:06:00,054
You know something?

895
01:06:00,061 --> 01:06:03,031
Do not start with the guessing game, okay?

896
01:06:08,084 --> 01:06:08,714
I just...

897
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,910
I'm not sure if I should...

898
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:14,131
There are no certainties or assumptions.

899
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:17,024
What does Nate want to do?

900
01:06:37,704 --> 01:06:38,543
How do I look?

901
01:06:38,543 --> 01:06:39,593
You look great.

902
01:06:40,922 --> 01:06:41,568
What are you doing?

903
01:06:41,568 --> 01:06:43,259
- No. ..
- Stop it!

904
01:06:43,259 --> 01:06:44,129
Be quiet.

905
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:48,042
The chosen, the proud...

906
01:06:49,868 --> 01:06:52,760
You know, you should let your hair grow a little.

907
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,030
Cover your ears a bit.

908
01:06:55,808 --> 01:06:58,078
There are not that great, but...

909
01:06:58,384 --> 01:07:00,534
a little hair looks good.

910
01:07:03,816 --> 01:07:08,046
What do you think my mother
will say when they see me like this?

911
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,639
Who cares what she thinks?

912
01:07:12,587 --> 01:07:16,341
You know, we get your car
and I'll ask him yourself.

913
01:07:16,341 --> 01:07:17,201
Who is he?

914
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,951
Where is he?

915
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,111
What happened?

916
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:21,249
You should!

917
01:07:23,136 --> 01:07:26,216
Maybe she is honest,
maybe not.

918
01:07:26,618 --> 01:07:27,768
And if not...

919
01:07:28,022 --> 01:07:30,352
find your father ourselves.

920
01:07:30,694 --> 01:07:31,854
Somehow.

921
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:36,118
Yes, it is our mission.

922
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:39,064
We travel the country looking for your father.

923
01:07:39,064 --> 01:07:40,444
I, you and Travis.

924
01:07:40,906 --> 01:07:42,006
It'll be great.

925
01:07:42,026 --> 01:07:42,836
You're right.

926
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:44,656
It's my life.

927
01:07:45,076 --> 01:07:46,586
The decisions are yours.

928
01:07:49,603 --> 01:07:50,413
Want to see?

929
01:07:55,526 --> 01:07:56,446
What do you think?

930
01:08:01,205 --> 01:08:02,945
I think I'm not coming back.

931
01:08:04,089 --> 01:08:06,699
They would have to wage war without me.

932
01:08:07,252 --> 01:08:08,292
Are you serious?

933
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,680
If you return the sheets by the neck
will be on my terms and not in theirs.

934
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,516
I think I have everything I need.

935
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:11,976
Looking at this brings me memories.

936
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:13,817
Where is my mother?

937
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,087
You are up front.

938
01:09:16,606 --> 01:09:18,766
You dress like a winner.

939
01:09:19,126 --> 01:09:20,365
Out with the old.

940
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:22,345
Your father would be proud.

941
01:09:25,558 --> 01:09:26,708
What's so funny?

942
01:09:29,622 --> 01:09:29,902
You!

943
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:31,569
You're ridiculous!

944
01:09:32,829 --> 01:09:33,819
I'm ridiculous?

945
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,728
For wanting something better than this?

946
01:09:37,144 --> 01:09:38,074
You blame me?

947
01:09:39,365 --> 01:09:41,351
He has his own office.

948
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:42,871
Make enough money.

949
01:09:44,561 --> 01:09:50,621
He put my picture on your desk for when
The visit is all they know I'm somebody.

950
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:52,339
He just the beginning.

951
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,280
Good luck.

952
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,895
You think I'm making a mistake?

953
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:26,456
Shit!

954
01:10:28,034 --> 01:10:28,674
Damn!

955
01:10:29,628 --> 01:10:31,568
Invoices, bills, bills!

956
01:10:33,224 --> 01:10:34,964
What are you doing back here?

957
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:38,415
What did the eyes?

958
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:40,039
Just...

959
01:10:41,348 --> 01:10:43,508
I wish you were honest mother.

960
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,770
You talked to him was not it?

961
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:52,510
Yes, because you told me
that man was my father.

962
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:56,630
Please! What difference does
who he is or where he is?

963
01:10:56,743 --> 01:10:58,957
It has nothing to do with
man or that you are going to be.

964
01:10:58,957 --> 01:11:03,597
If you think this is even then
why not tell me where is he?

965
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:08,887
I'll give you one more chance
tell me where is my father.

966
01:11:09,944 --> 01:11:11,094
Or do what?

967
01:11:13,117 --> 01:11:14,567
It will tell me or not?

968
01:11:21,212 --> 01:11:22,202
So I quit.

969
01:11:30,796 --> 01:11:31,256
Well ..

970
01:11:31,825 --> 01:11:33,259
if you think this is the right decision.

971
01:11:33,259 --> 01:11:35,856
How can I
whether it is the right decision?

972
01:11:35,856 --> 01:11:39,636
It's not as if I had
a model of behavior.

973
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:47,919
It's the same old story
or is it an idea of u200bu200byour friend?

974
01:11:48,052 --> 01:11:48,392
No.

975
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:50,118
It was her.

976
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:52,321
My?

977
01:11:54,502 --> 01:11:55,372
Let's mom...

978
01:11:56,244 --> 01:11:58,754
never thought I would achieve.

979
01:11:58,778 --> 01:12:00,878
I never wanted I could.

980
01:12:02,337 --> 01:12:06,587
How can you say one thing
knowing that such is not true?

981
01:12:11,066 --> 01:12:11,816
It's true!

982
01:12:38,327 --> 01:12:38,967
You know...?

983
01:12:44,588 --> 01:12:45,388
Your father!

984
01:12:46,539 --> 01:12:47,639
It was a military man.

985
01:12:50,802 --> 01:12:51,142
E. ..

986
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:55,537
I thought things worked,

987
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,790
Between us, it's perfect.

988
01:13:01,226 --> 01:13:01,566
E. ..

989
01:13:03,436 --> 01:13:05,134
When I was pregnant with you...

990
01:13:05,134 --> 01:13:06,824
he was so proud.

991
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:08,594
Because he was the one.

992
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,170
It was!

993
01:13:13,213 --> 01:13:13,673
But...

994
01:13:14,756 --> 01:13:19,846
when he returned from service any
thing happened, he was different.

995
01:13:20,392 --> 01:13:23,482
And I thought I should find someone else.

996
01:13:24,123 --> 01:13:27,213
Did not want to shame you had from your father.

997
01:13:27,951 --> 01:13:32,261
How can I be ashamed of
someone who does not even know his mother?

998
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,880
You know him Nate!

999
01:13:40,307 --> 01:13:41,297
You know him!

1000
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:47,898
Sorry!

1001
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,125
Hola Nate!

1002
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:17,122
I'm looking for the key.

1003
01:14:17,122 --> 01:14:18,737
It's here somewhere.
Give me a second.

1004
01:14:18,737 --> 01:14:21,697
No. Okay.
Take the time you want.

1005
01:14:31,528 --> 01:14:34,518
I hid it somewhere specifically,

1006
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:37,982
not to lose the special e. ..

1007
01:14:41,591 --> 01:14:44,551
I hid it very much.
That's the problem.

1008
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:52,536
I keep repeating myself,

1009
01:14:52,536 --> 01:14:58,476
I have to organize myself one day, but
am so busy chasing my tail...

1010
01:15:02,757 --> 01:15:03,217
You....

1011
01:15:04,555 --> 01:15:07,645
Are you planning to open your own garage?

1012
01:15:08,448 --> 01:15:12,178
've Been planning since I was your age, just...

1013
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,733
can not stop planning and start doing.

1014
01:15:15,733 --> 01:15:16,193
Yes ..

1015
01:15:17,327 --> 01:15:19,597
Yes, I walk around within this site

1016
01:15:19,674 --> 01:15:21,074
busy working

1017
01:15:21,103 --> 01:15:22,433
and never get a. ..

1018
01:15:23,123 --> 01:15:25,403
have the important things done.

1019
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:34,836
So is it.

1020
01:15:42,558 --> 01:15:43,368
Tiny cute.

1021
01:15:43,858 --> 01:15:44,368
Is yours?

1022
01:15:45,057 --> 01:15:45,747
All mine!

1023
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,668
My to do bullshit.

1024
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:48,068
Yeah!

1025
01:15:49,785 --> 01:15:52,515
Well, I did lots with Nate, but...

1026
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:53,949
he did well.

1027
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:58,133
He is an excellent type.

1028
01:15:58,133 --> 01:15:58,473
Yes

1029
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:03,210
I remember Nate at this age.

1030
01:16:03,256 --> 01:16:07,452
Sometimes when I go to work, eye
for the rearview mirror and I can swear,

1031
01:16:07,452 --> 01:16:14,042
yet when I see sitting behind the bench
with baby toys scattered everywhere.

1032
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:15,504
I miss that.

1033
01:16:17,318 --> 01:16:20,108
When I look at Nate, I... I...

1034
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,130
see my...

1035
01:16:22,437 --> 01:16:23,597
my purpose!

1036
01:16:24,545 --> 01:16:24,996
And my...

1037
01:16:24,996 --> 01:16:26,556
My reason for being!

1038
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,520
Nate was my...

1039
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:31,584
Vocation?

1040
01:16:32,362 --> 01:16:34,112
Vocation!
Exactly! Yes!

1041
01:16:36,745 --> 01:16:37,435
I just....

1042
01:16:38,082 --> 01:16:40,062
It's so hard to let go.

1043
01:16:49,861 --> 01:16:50,841
You okay?

1044
01:16:52,834 --> 01:16:54,234
You want anything?

1045
01:16:57,107 --> 01:16:59,414
There is wrapping paper, do you?

1046
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:02,154
Wrapping paper?
As for gifts?

1047
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:03,190
Yes

1048
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:09,979
I found the key!

1049
01:17:13,335 --> 01:17:16,945
The damn key was on my neck all the time.

1050
01:17:23,178 --> 01:17:24,468
Look... sorry...

1051
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:25,794
No. It's okay...

1052
01:17:25,794 --> 01:17:27,424
I wanted to repair the car.

1053
01:17:27,629 --> 01:17:29,769
Okay Gene.
Did very well.

1054
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:34,070
Yes .. just... the same story.
Nothing special.

1055
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,168
How much do you...
How much do we owe you?

1056
01:17:38,168 --> 01:17:40,028
Do not worry about it.

1057
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:42,775
What's up?

1058
01:17:44,799 --> 01:17:46,439
Tell me about that...

1059
01:17:46,607 --> 01:17:47,597
such driving.

1060
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,430
That to the base?

1061
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:52,027
Yes

1062
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:55,490
Nothing to tell...

1063
01:17:56,849 --> 01:17:58,299
used to go there.

1064
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,741
I and thy mother.

1065
01:18:24,089 --> 01:18:25,949
Do not tell him did you?

1066
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:29,392
No.

1067
01:18:31,925 --> 01:18:32,795
Will you tell?

1068
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:40,523
Sorry Nate!

1069
01:18:47,653 --> 01:18:49,863
I'd better go to work.

1070
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,053
Is everything okay?

1071
01:19:34,325 --> 01:19:35,005
What is it?

1072
01:19:44,849 --> 01:19:46,769
Are you coming with us does it?

1073
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:53,031
It was a stupid idea, I suppose.

1074
01:19:54,234 --> 01:19:55,574
Not very realistic.

1075
01:20:05,619 --> 01:20:10,399
He could sit in this car for
always and not even walk a meter.

1076
01:20:16,566 --> 01:20:18,546
I miss my mother.

1077
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,865
I better take you back to base.

1078
01:20:40,623 --> 01:20:43,123
There is a place where I go first.

1079
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:00,911
I'm proud of you.

1080
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:18,961
It's here. You can park here.

1081
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:21,782
What happened here?

1082
01:21:26,935 --> 01:21:29,435
Actually, I think it was here...

1083
01:21:30,549 --> 01:21:31,349
It was what?

1084
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:35,886
Have you thought where are you going?

1085
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:37,081
I do not know.

1086
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,191
I think I'll trust the universe to guide us.

1087
01:21:43,175 --> 01:21:43,625
And you?

1088
01:21:44,826 --> 01:21:46,777
Are you sure about this?

1089
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:50,507
I'll try to stay focused.
Do not chase my tail.

1090
01:21:50,877 --> 01:21:52,087
It's a good idea.

1091
01:21:54,141 --> 01:21:57,793
The base lies at the end of the road
I can walk the rest of the path.

1092
01:21:57,793 --> 01:21:58,503
Are you sure?

1093
01:21:58,503 --> 01:21:58,843
Yes

1094
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:00,138
I'll walk.

1095
01:22:18,881 --> 01:22:20,271
I have something for you.

1096
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:23,473
I wrapped it in the house of your mother.

1097
01:22:23,473 --> 01:22:24,503
What is this?

1098
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,113
Good luck soldier.

1099
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:14,360
Will you work?

1100
01:23:16,045 --> 01:23:17,425
What do you think?

1101
01:23:18,974 --> 01:23:21,884
I received my benefit earlier this month.

1102
01:23:22,007 --> 01:23:23,467
You did well Gene.

1103
01:23:26,473 --> 01:23:27,103
Hey Deb!

1104
01:23:28,694 --> 01:23:30,494
Nate got me thinking...

1105
01:23:31,045 --> 01:23:32,179
remember when...

1106
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:35,676
You and I used to...
Remember that night at the drive-in?

1107
01:23:35,676 --> 01:23:37,126
How long have you been?

1108
01:23:41,659 --> 01:23:43,339
Gene has a good night.

1109
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:05,938
Nate?

1110
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:14,733
You know I never did any of this before, right?

1111
01:24:15,293 --> 01:24:18,383
But if you stay with me, I think we're fine.

1112
01:24:27,019 --> 01:24:28,119
A new beginning.
