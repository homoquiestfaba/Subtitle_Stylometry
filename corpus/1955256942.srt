1
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,849
-Howdy.
-Hey, how's it going?

2
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:52,218
I don't know much
about these trucks,

3
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,489
but my truck just died,
I don't know.

4
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:57,390
Do you know anything,
could you maybe

5
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,060
give me a hand there?

6
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,229
I don't know too much more
than you, I'm sure.

7
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:02,628
Yeah.

8
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,731
But I can at least
take a look for you.

9
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, I appreciate it.

10
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:10,772
It might be the spark plug,
I'm not really sure.

11
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:15,743
Look right... Be careful,
right in there, yeah.

12
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,877
Right.
! Shit!

13
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,646
Yeah, watch it...
Yeah, it's hot now.

14
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,313
-Pardon my language.
-Yeah.

15
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,684
That's all right, that's fine,
brother. It don't bother me.

16
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,020
-I mean, I gotta...
-Be careful in there, now.

17
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:33,746
<b>SACRAMENT</b>

18
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:37,056
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

19
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:31,645
Why?

20
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,350
'Cause it's time
to get up.

21
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,018
Five more minutes.

22
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,520
Nope.

23
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,856
You gotta get up now.

24
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,759
Fuck you.

25
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,394
We really need
to get on the road.

26
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,898
I told you that last night
when you were like...

27
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,035
"Babe,
just one more drink,"

28
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,571
and then you finished
the entire bottle.

29
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,275
Really?

30
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,786
Please explain to me why the words
"butt pirate" are written on my car.

31
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,068
I'm so ready to hear this.

32
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:40,914
Jeff and Alex got a little
extra-drinky last night.

33
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,852
I think they thought
it'd be funny.

34
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,087
And you just let them do it.

35
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,057
I'm sorry, baby.

36
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,527
I was in no condition to traverse
the perils of Mount Apartmentstair

37
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,794
in my state.

38
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,948
Look.

39
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,251
I know these past couple of
days haven't been easy for you.

40
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,422
But we're going to make up
for it this weekend. Okay?

41
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,325
Okay.

42
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,039
Everybody up.

43
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:49,150
You drooled
on my foot, stupid.

44
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:58,559
I love watching
your ass when you walk.

45
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,466
Holy shit.

46
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:19,246
I'm sure there's a reason, but why
are we leaving at freaking dawn?

47
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,554
Hey. If I have to do it,
so do you.

48
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,657
Damn, you want me to
puke all over you? Damn.

49
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,325
Suck it up, dude.

50
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,234
It's time to get up, bitch.

51
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:46,039
We gotta hurry. We don't want
Swissy Missy getting all pissy.

52
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:50,210
That's hot cocoa.
This is coffee, genius.

53
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,381
- My God!
- Whatever.

54
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,886
I'm already ready, you butch.

55
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,165
Do not light that in my house.

56
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,402
I wasn't gonna. I was just
getting it ready for the road.

57
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,939
Everybody, let's go!
Move, come on.

58
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,208
Hey, okay!

59
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,325
Hey, wait.
Who wrote all over Lee's car?

60
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,091
I can't help but notice that you
didn't get so festive with your car.

61
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,328
Yeah, but I drive
the Mu-tang, Dad.

62
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,263
I gotta keep up appearances,
you know, for the ladies.

63
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,036
Do you know how many miles
I get to the gallon?

64
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,304
Here.

65
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,308
At least you'll be getting use
out of some kind of rubber.

66
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,111
Damn! I thought you people were
supposed to like balloons and glitter.

67
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,848
Thought it'd make you
all rainbow-happy and shit.

68
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,343
What the...

69
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,179
No!

70
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,580
No!

71
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,682
What the fuck is that?

72
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,754
No! Na.

73
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,758
Not fuckin' me.

74
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,536
Come on, mother...

75
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,611
Come on.

76
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,427
Come on, you fucker.

77
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,741
Okay. Okay.

78
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,156
Okay. Okay.

79
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:09,589
So what weirdness are you subjecting
us to for breakfast this morning?

80
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,893
Because hung-over or not,
I gotta eat.

81
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:16,964
We just wanted you to experience
that whole "Southern hospitality."

82
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,469
Just as long as I never have
to see another freaking grit.

83
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,703
God, you people eat
weird shit down here.

84
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:26,139
- Grits are good.
-They're nasty.

85
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,810
Hey, have you checked
on that storm lately?

86
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,313
You know, it's going to be
raining all fucking week

87
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,414
and we're going to be
stuck inside the whole time.

88
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,283
You are so negative.

89
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,786
Your face is a negative.
Just checked it, bitches.

90
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,255
It looks like
it's still heading north.

91
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,825
Hurricane Bertha,
get to steppin'.

92
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,196
Hey! It's that playground I used
to play at with my grandpa.

93
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,619
So...

94
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,223
So what?

95
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,330
So did you get
with either of them?

96
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,465
I'll get there. Don't you worry about
that, you pussy-whipped old prick.

97
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,067
You do realize
I'm in the car, right?

98
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,936
My God. Don't.

99
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,040
All I'm saying is
the groundwork takes time.

100
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:37,343
The ladies,
I mean, the bitches,

101
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,378
can't know
we're running games on them.

102
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,381
You guys are idiots.

103
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,485
Either of you happen to know
what's up with Blake?

104
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,822
He passed out way early last night
and I think I heard him crying.

105
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,293
I don't know. Something to do
with his grandparents.

106
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,898
I guess they heard about him and
Lee and disowned him or some shit.

107
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,834
What, like they didn't know?
How could they not know?

108
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,015
Well, sir,
that is one heck of a story.

109
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,884
Yes, sir, one heck of a story.

110
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,721
Would you excuse us for just
a moment, Mr. Ranscombe?

111
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,926
I see the sheriff, and I want you to
tell him just exactly what you told me.

112
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,494
Can you do that for me, son?

113
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,562
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

114
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,898
Maybe when we get back, we'll help you
with that hand. We'll be right back.

115
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,534
Yeah. We'll be right back.

116
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,025
<i>Well. Are you in jail again?</i>

117
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,527
No, Ma, not again.

118
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,895
<i>Caller ID says
the police station.</i>

119
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,897
Yeah.

120
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,265
<i>I mean, I'm telling you, I'm really
tired of these kinds of calls.</i>

121
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,466
<i>-Yes.
-What's going on now?</i>

122
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,635
<i>-I don't...
-Where are you?</i>

123
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,071
I don't know!
I'm in Middle Spring.

124
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,374
<i>-You need to grow up.
-Yeah.</i>

125
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,109
<i>Talk to me. What's going on?</i>

126
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,211
<i>Listen, I am so tired...</i>

127
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,349
Ma, can you please
just come and get me?

128
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,584
<i>-Okay.
-Okay.</i>

129
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,821
<i>I'll be there shortly.
I love you.</i>

130
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,189
You, too.

131
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,506
Well, son. Sounds like you had
yourself one hell of a morning.

132
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,311
Say, I didn't mean
to overhear,

133
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,847
but did I hear you on the
phone talking to your family?

134
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,948
Did you tell them you're
all safe and sound right here?

135
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,684
Yes, sir, my...

136
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,287
My mom's supposed
to be coming to get me.

137
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,357
Good boy.

138
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,191
Well, while we're waiting,
if you don't mind,

139
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,594
would you just kind of run through the
whole thing for me one more time?

140
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,163
Could you do that?

141
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,148
I was so scared, I...

142
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,016
I just didn't know
what else to do.

143
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,485
Hold on a sec.

144
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:34,153
Yeah.

145
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:37,757
You sure?

146
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,430
Well, that's what
I was afraid of.

147
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,417
So, I guess, do you want me to tell
you the rest of the story now?

148
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,854
Sheriff! That's him!

149
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,523
Now, son,
son, settle down!

150
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,324
I'm gonna have to apologize
for Brother Simon here,

151
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,194
he should've been
a little more careful.

152
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,362
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you fucking crazy?

153
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,265
You're supposed to help me!

154
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,770
Son, if you just settle down and
cooperate, it's gonna go a lot easier.

155
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,254
Had to be a smartass and grab somebody
from outside of town, didn't you?

156
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,691
Well, call the doctor.

157
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,793
Somebody gonna tell me how this little
son of a bitch got away from the hunter?

158
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,136
No, no. You're not listening
to me. I'm telling you.

159
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,538
I just talked to him a couple of hours
ago and everything was just fine.

160
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,074
I understand, Mrs. Ranscombe.

161
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,244
Hopefully, we're just dealing
with shock,

162
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,714
and after
a few days' observation,

163
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:12,651
we can be sure that he won't be a
danger to himself or anyone else.

164
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,788
He did attack a deputy,
after all....

165
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,256
Doc.

166
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,158
Ma'am.

167
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:23,163
I hope you understand this really
is the best thing for him.

168
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,832
Now my deputy is not going
to press charges.

169
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,234
We wanna make sure your son's
getting all the help he needs

170
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:31,403
so this kind of thing
doesn't happen again.

171
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,806
...Can I see him?

172
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:41,280
Why don't we just see
how things go tonight, and...

173
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,317
Go home, get some rest. I'll give
you a call with an update tomorrow.

174
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,320
-Can we do that?
-I guess.

175
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,824
Weren't no dog! It was him.
You know it was him!

176
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,692
Yeah, but if he wasn't
Isaac's boy,

177
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,028
he would've been put down
like a dog by now!

178
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,996
I just don't know how the hell
he keeps getting out!

179
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,944
I'm really sorry about that.

180
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,546
Please, let's just...
Let's just go outside.

181
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,227
You didn't think I was hanging
around you bitches, did you?

182
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,330
But we wuvs you, Jennifer!

183
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,366
Come here, come here.

184
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,069
...Let it happen.

185
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,803
Too far.

186
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,004
<i>Mama will fix you
right up, sugar.</i>

187
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,374
- She loves it.
- She doesn't.

188
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,011
<i>I see
a world filled with evil.</i>

189
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,648
<i>They sell it to your children
on the television.</i>

190
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,551
<i>They sell it to your children
through the music.</i>

191
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:58,257
<i>Your children are being
filled up with these lies.</i>

192
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,361
<i>They say, "Love the sinner,
hate the sin."</i>

193
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,129
<i>I say, "No!"</i>

194
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,501
<i>All manner of perversion
has to be accepted?</i>

195
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,737
<i>I say, "No!"</i>

196
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,442
"No" is right, asshole.

197
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,951
Food! Food!

198
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,439
So why are we stopping?

199
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:26,012
Well, A,
the Mu-tang needs gas.

200
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,980
We can't all be eco-freaks.

201
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,984
Two, I need to go
drain my hog.

202
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,151
- And C, well...
- Okay.

203
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,724
We're going inside. Whenever
you're ready to get moving.

204
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,043
Man, what are you doing?

205
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:01,214
Sorry, ma'am,
that was our fault.

206
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,216
Y'all looking for anything
in particular?

207
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,987
We got a little bit of just about everything
back there, there's even some clothes.

208
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,723
They're used, but ain't
nothing wrong with them.

209
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:12,124
Maybe something to eat?

210
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,761
My wife's cooking up
a mess of barbecue.

211
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:18,864
I don't think so.

212
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,134
You sure?
She's a heck of a cook!

213
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,235
It is pretty darn good.

214
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,339
Just made up
a batch of biscuits, too.

215
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,740
You look like
you could use a good meal.

216
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:30,042
You're so thin.

217
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,745
No, ma'am,
I think we're good.

218
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,013
Thank you, though.

219
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,048
"Ma'am"!

220
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,586
"Ma'am."

221
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,755
Hear that, old man?
"Ma'am" and "sir."

222
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,092
Some young'uns
were raised up right.

223
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,262
Totally hideous,
like I expected.

224
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,800
Well, I expected more hideous.

225
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,169
I heard... Okay, stop it.

226
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,437
You're being weird.

227
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,906
How about this?

228
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,109
Why're you pulling on me?

229
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,709
You're pretty.

230
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:08,080
Hope I can be that pretty
when I grow up.

231
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,083
My gosh, aren't you sweet?
What've you got there?

232
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,289
What is that?

233
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,157
Why won't you let me read it?

234
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,930
Guess if the lizard was smaller, it
wouldn't take so long to drain, right?

235
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,434
Take home some barbecue, it's
all made up and ready to go.

236
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,236
Well, thank you, ma'am.
How much do we owe you?

237
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,705
Don't worry about it,
not one bit.

238
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:37,176
Be careful on those old roads, though.
There's a big storm a-coming.

239
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,245
-Okay, thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.

240
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,522
Hey, pops, I don't suppose
you take plastic? No?

241
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,544
Couldn't get
much worse than this.

242
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,785
Hi. Can I get you
anything, miss?

243
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,526
Honey, are you all right?

244
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,494
Kids.

245
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,996
I just wish
they came with a manual.

246
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,766
Well, we can put 'em
on the right path,

247
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,469
but it's up to them
to make the choices.

248
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:39,472
This one's in
a lot of goddamn trouble.

249
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:43,775
They've got him under observation
up there at that hospital.

250
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,547
Now, dear, the good Lord didn't have
anything to do with that, did he?

251
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,383
No, but he doesn't seem to be
doing anything about it, either.

252
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,635
Jesus, I mean...

253
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:54,186
We can't have that kind
of talk in here, missy.

254
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,487
We just can't.

255
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,658
Do you have
a powder room, ma'am?

256
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:02,328
Why, dear, of course.
It's right down there.

257
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,763
Thank you so much.

258
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,501
Excuse me.

259
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,902
No, excuse me.

260
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,107
Fuck...

261
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,715
Now we just can't have you taking the
Lord's name in vain again, can we, sweetie?

262
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,817
Just lie still.
The less you move...

263
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,553
The less it's gonna hurt.

264
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,427
I promise you.

265
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,729
It'll be quick.

266
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,598
Why...

267
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,679
That ought to
keep him quiet for a while.

268
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,385
Darn it, old man.

269
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,522
Now I've gotta mop
the floor again.

270
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:06,391
-Put her in the kitchen where I can drain her proper.
-All right. All right.

271
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,895
Here we go.

272
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,342
What is this
supposed to mean?

273
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:32,617
What, now I'm supposed
to speak inbred redneck?

274
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,152
I don't know, you seem to know
everything else.

275
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,355
Shut up.

276
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,527
Are we there yet?

277
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:48,900
We're closer, but I was thinking
maybe we could stop for the night.

278
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:49,936
Why don't we stop up there?

279
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:55,140
How can you think
about more barbecue right now?

280
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,311
Didn't you have enough of that
drippy meat at that store?

281
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,179
Do you really think anybody in this
car has got enough hot, drippy meat?

282
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,215
My God.

283
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:18,864
Dear God, please tell me this
isn't where we're stopping.

284
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:23,601
Anyone wanna bet there's
no pool, bar, Internet,

285
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,539
anything even vaguely
interesting or modern?

286
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,206
Take a look in that bag
under the floorboard.

287
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,875
I think
I got your bar covered.

288
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:31,410
Really?

289
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:36,148
Nice!

290
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,550
But it doesn't look like
you got enough for you.

291
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,518
Shit.

292
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,254
You better learn to share if you
want some more of this weed.

293
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:46,391
Holy shit, do you smell that?

294
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,960
Smells like somebody's
got the munchies.

295
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,882
As thrilled as I am that you
wrote "butt pirate" on my car,

296
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,685
I think it wouldn't have
taken us so long

297
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,053
if we didn't have to
stop by a car wash.

298
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,888
Alex just wants love.

299
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,760
Relax, princess. Relax.

300
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,462
You're my princess.

301
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,904
How y'all doing?

302
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,939
Y'all need some rooms?

303
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,142
Why, yes, ma'am.

304
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,478
Unless I can help you
fold them sheets first.

305
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,615
Two rooms for you?

306
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,917
Yes, ma'am,
that'll be fine.

307
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,120
Good.
'Cause that's what I've got.

308
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,255
One room for the boys,

309
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,827
and one room for the girls...

310
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,329
Unless any of
y'all's married....

311
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:32,498
Didn't think so.

312
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,500
Bud!

313
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,804
Bud! You hear me, boy?

314
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,686
You help these young'uns
get their things upstairs.

315
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,688
Then you get back down here and you
finish up your chores, you hear me?

316
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:57,990
Yes'm.

317
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,499
Let me get that.

318
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,100
-Here, I'll take that.
-My bag!

319
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,168
I can take mine.

320
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,704
You got my bags in here.

321
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,004
Yeah.

322
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,542
There, man.

323
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,744
I think I see Shell's pool!

324
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,883
You boys are going to have
to give us a little while.

325
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:27,386
Well, shit. You don't waste
any time, do you?

326
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,621
Where exactly am I
supposed to sleep?

327
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:32,224
Well, Big Daddy,
you can share with me.

328
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:34,292
You'll keep me
nice and warm....

329
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,362
Or you can lay on the floor. What
the hell's the big deal anyway?

330
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,062
The queers are sleeping
over there.

331
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,833
Shit, man, I just don't like being
that close to another dude.

332
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,468
Fuck me!

333
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:46,171
Fuck me hard! Alex!

334
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,908
I have no intention of spending a
lot of time in this room anyway.

335
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,344
It's all yours.

336
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,413
-You've been working out.
-Thanks, baby.

337
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,758
What's wrong?

338
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,592
Have you seen
my earring anywhere?

339
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,229
I think that creepy lady
downstairs ate it.

340
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,231
Maybe it's in the car.

341
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,033
Jesus fucking Christ!

342
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,869
No, but it's as close as
you're going to get. My God.

343
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:22,107
Don't you know how to knock,
motherfucker?

344
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,543
Don't you know
how to wipe?

345
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,254
Come on, baby, I found us
a little place to take a dip.

346
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,655
A skinny one, even.
Okay, let's go.

347
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,727
Your hipster-geek fetish
disturbs me sometimes.

348
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,530
Whatever.

349
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,366
Get it in while you can, girl.
We're out of here in the morning.

350
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,368
Don't wait up, ladies.

351
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,578
Entertain me.

352
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,916
We have to cut through
these lies

353
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,284
with the sharp blade
of The Word.

354
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,986
Amen.

355
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:13,225
We have to feed our children
on the truth.

356
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,726
-Amen.
-Hallelujah.

357
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,430
We have to plant the seed
of that truth

358
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,533
in our children's bellies,
and watch it grow.

359
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,836
Amen!

360
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,939
No more can we let
these blasphemers

361
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:31,176
starve the souls
of our children.

362
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,744
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

363
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:39,952
When these people come into our
lives, we have to show them the way.

364
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,620
Amen!

365
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,844
I don't know how they do it,

366
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,214
but this food has been touched
by the angels.

367
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,516
Ain't you eating, hon?

368
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,585
There's nothing here
I can eat.

369
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:50,855
What do you mean? There's a whole
plate there right in front of you.

370
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,726
I'm a vegetarian.
I don't eat meat.

371
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,860
Get yourself some tuna salad.

372
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,830
-Tuna is meat.
-It ain't. It's fish!

373
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:02,501
Fish is still meat.
You know, a dead animal.

374
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:05,738
Well, here, you just eat
some of them baked beans.

375
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,539
You can just pick
that bacon right out.

376
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,076
Here,
I'll take the bacon.

377
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,444
What's wrong, little sister?

378
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:17,416
There's meat in everything!
I can't eat it.

379
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:22,688
You see, little sister, a man's
faith allows him to eat anything.

380
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,659
But a man whose faith is weak
eats only vegetables.

381
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:50,815
Hungry!

382
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,687
Hungry!

383
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:58,924
Hungry!

384
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,793
Hungry!

385
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,931
Hungry!

386
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,633
Shut up, you crazy fuck!

387
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,404
- Hungry!
-Quiet!

388
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,007
I don't want to hear
any more out of you!

389
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,507
-Hungry!
-Stop.

390
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,480
Shut up!

391
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:26,317
Shut up.

392
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,821
Shut the fuck up.

393
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,290
Shut up!

394
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,886
Shit. What now?

395
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,237
What?

396
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:35,407
No!

397
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:46,618
Hungry! Hungry!
Hungry! Hungry!

398
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,867
Get The Hunter out here now.

399
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,636
I'm not going into the woods
after that crazy prick.

400
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:05,937
I don't care whose kid he is.

401
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,743
Come on. He couldn't
have gone that far.

402
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,236
Fuck.

403
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,072
Fuck it.

404
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,340
Fuck.

405
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,778
Bitch.

406
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,725
Fuck me!

407
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,962
Motherfucker.

408
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,134
What the fuck
is this shit?

409
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,707
Shoes? Yeah.

410
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:52,276
No.

411
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,080
That's right.
Motherfucking shoes.

412
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,315
Come on, now, get the fuck on.

413
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,324
What the...
What the fuck?

414
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,177
Fuck. Fuck.

415
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,552
Drink.

416
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,371
Mom... Mommy?

417
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,534
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

418
00:43:56,933 --> 00:44:00,938
I just don't know if I'm
reaching them, brothers.

419
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,109
We are going to have
to push even harder.

420
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,277
I think you're right, but...

421
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,981
Don't think grabbing them off the
street is a great way to start.

422
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,652
Yes, sir.
I heard about that boy.

423
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,589
Got to be smarter, Simon.

424
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,723
Picot hadn't worked
as quick as he did,

425
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,628
we would be
in a world of spit right now.

426
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,098
I know.

427
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,301
And you're right.
It won't happen again.

428
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,902
Now listen.

429
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:33,837
We have to start with the
folks we know we can trust.

430
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,407
But brother, when you're
talking about more people,

431
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,275
you're talking about
more mouths to feed.

432
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,245
I mean, how can we make sure
we have enough?

433
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:44,782
The revivals, they help.

434
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,152
But if enough people
go a-missing,

435
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,421
then somebody is going to ask
questions that we can't answer.

436
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:51,922
It doesn't matter.

437
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:56,328
We have to save as many of
these lost souls as possible.

438
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,531
We'll just have to expand
the stables we have.

439
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:03,268
BeBe says she's got at least six
feeders ready for harvesting,

440
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:05,369
and if we're careful...

441
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,176
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Brother Isaac.

442
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,478
BeBe's got a whole mess of kids
staying down at the hotel.

443
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:18,082
Maybe some of those "lost
souls" you were talking about.

444
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:23,255
Number one, we need to get
that Hunter out of the woods.

445
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,190
Yes, sir.

446
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:30,228
And two, we need to start
the harvest close to home.

447
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,897
Those kids over at BeBe's?

448
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:37,069
Divide and conquer, brothers.
Divide and conquer.

449
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,639
I need to get back
to my flock.

450
00:45:42,672 --> 00:45:46,977
Brahm, take a couple of boys,
and be smart about it.

451
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,080
-Don't let me down.
-But Daddy...

452
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:54,886
Son, you're the only one
I know I can trust.

453
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,223
When I'm gone, it will be you
up on that pulpit.

454
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,759
Okay, Daddy.

455
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,032
You heard him, boys.

456
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:14,539
And you're right, Simon.
We do need more food.

457
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:17,442
But if you fail us again, you won't
have to worry about who's eating what.

458
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,211
Got me?

459
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,858
Jesus!

460
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,927
What's wrong?
Are you scared of the dark?

461
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,130
-You didn't hear that?
-What, the thunder?

462
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:50,502
Thunder, my ass,
those were gunshots.

463
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,804
My God, bullshit. Blake said
storms were headed this way.

464
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,176
Come on.
Are you coming or what?

465
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,054
Shit.

466
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:14,658
Damn it.

467
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:17,661
That's why
I shook mine out, smart guy.

468
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,665
Look, I think we need
to get back.

469
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,067
I'm telling you,
those were gunshots.

470
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,071
My God, and I'm telling
you, it was just thunder.

471
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:29,741
Now, do you want to
lie down here with me,

472
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,976
or do you want to go back
to your boys at the hotel?

473
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,580
You got all the answers,
don't you?

474
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,681
Not all of them.

475
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,152
Well, that didn't take you
too long, did it?

476
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,286
Babe?

477
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,122
-"Meats for the belly..."
-What the fuck!

478
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,558
"...and belly for meat."

479
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:55,648
Who the fuck are you?

480
00:49:55,649 --> 00:49:57,762
"But the Lord shall
destroy both it and them."

481
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:58,951
Let her go!

482
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:01,264
"Now, the body is
not for fornication,

483
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:03,611
"but for the Lord, and
the Lord for the body."

484
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:04,768
Get the fuck off me!

485
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:06,170
Shell!

486
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,708
Brothers, let's help these
sinners cleanse themselves.

487
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,710
Shell!

488
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,280
Let her go. Shell!

489
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,493
"Wash me completely
of my evil..."

490
00:50:18,494 --> 00:50:19,584
Shell! Let her go.

491
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,272
Get off of me.

492
00:50:20,273 --> 00:50:21,585
"...and purge me from my sins."

493
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:24,421
-Amen, brothers!
-Amen!

494
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,958
Shell! Let her go!

495
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:28,426
Shell!

496
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:33,665
Shell!

497
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,366
Why are you doing this?

498
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:38,335
Get off of me! Fuck!

499
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:45,043
Get off of me.

500
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,709
Time to wash your sins away,
too, brother.

501
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:41,565
Go, go, go.

502
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:44,468
All right, give it to me.

503
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,104
Drink.

504
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:52,777
Hell, yeah.

505
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:06,257
You know,

506
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,960
for someone so worried about
sleeping next to another guy,

507
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:11,928
you sure don't mind sharing
this shaft with me.

508
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,866
Pussy.

509
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:19,203
Besides, the smoke
totally sterilizes it.

510
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:22,773
-Okay, buddy.
-What?

511
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,214
Looks like we're stuck.

512
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:31,748
We might as well just
go home tomorrow.

513
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,251
No, Boo.

514
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,121
Boo is right.
I don't want to go home yet.

515
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,761
Shit, you want to stay here?

516
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,498
At least if we go back now,
we can party for real.

517
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,970
Not that fucked up, buddy.

518
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,741
So, I'm hungry.

519
00:52:57,775 --> 00:53:00,278
- Who's hungry?
-Yeah.

520
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,813
- I could eat.
- You can always eat.

521
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,152
Baby?

522
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,123
Baby?

523
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:19,197
Let me guess, do I get to be
the one to go and get it?

524
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,199
Well, the rest of us are
way too fucked up to go.

525
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:26,171
Seriously?

526
00:53:28,404 --> 00:53:31,374
Handle your high.

527
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:33,511
Hey, you think there's a burger
place open? No, I don't.

528
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,679
- Cheeseburger?
- Nope.

529
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,147
No.

530
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,614
Chocolate sundae?
Zucchini? Okay.

531
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:38,715
Pizza?
Corn dog?

532
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,116
-No.
-Come on.

533
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,487
You are going to eat
whatever I bring you.

534
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:49,893
I'm going straight there and coming
straight back. Try not to destroy anything.

535
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,262
Since when do you
do anything straight?

536
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,869
So you want grits.

537
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,638
Okay, and you want
vagina, so...

538
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:06,878
- Love you.
- Love you.

539
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,386
You going out alone tonight?

540
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:19,322
You almost
scared me to death.

541
00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:22,459
I'm just going to go grab some
food for me and my friends.

542
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,096
You have a good night.

543
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:27,031
You, too.

544
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,799
What's up?

545
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:07,839
So, Lorri, how's it going?

546
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,742
How's what going?

547
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:19,817
You know, things,
life, whatnot.

548
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,186
Life's not really "whatnot,"
but it's going just fine.

549
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:36,967
Do you want to maybe go somewhere
a little bit more private?

550
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,104
You know,
just the two of us?

551
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:45,543
You know, going somewhere more
private sounds really good.

552
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:50,313
But you should probably
go by yourself.

553
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,249
I have some lotion and tissues
in my bag if you get lonely.

554
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:55,118
I just... I don't want
to be your pity fuck.

555
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,024
You know what? Fuck you guys.

556
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,196
Wait, don't go.

557
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,672
I'm sorry, sir,
that was... That was my fault.

558
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,107
No apologies necessary, son.

559
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:19,543
If I wasn't so full
of Mama C's cooking,

560
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:22,313
I'd be navigating
by sense of smell myself.

561
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,681
Have a good night.

562
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:31,222
Thank you very much.

563
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:32,857
Can I get two of these
to go, please?

564
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,658
Be right with you, sugar.

565
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,065
Tell them I'm on my way.

566
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:43,634
Now they just told me
we've got no more meat ready.

567
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:45,136
But if you give me
just a minute,

568
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:48,906
I'll make sure
you get fixed up right.

569
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:52,609
Can you wait for just a couple,
sugar? I promise, it'll be worth it.

570
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:55,879
Sure, that's fine.

571
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,549
Now you just go and sit
yourself right down there,

572
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,518
and I'll be back
quick as I can.

573
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:02,353
Yes, ma'am.

574
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:11,162
What are you doing letting me run
out of meat out there on that line?

575
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,196
And don't you tell me
we got no more!

576
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,000
We've got something for you,
Mama C!

577
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,235
Call it...
Call it an offering.

578
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,936
"An offering,"

579
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:47,031
"Go out into the flock and
find me two fine young goats.

580
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:50,067
"I will use them to prepare
your father's favorite dish."

581
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,803
Go and get the other one.

582
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:19,996
"And the eyes of all
look unto you,

583
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:23,533
"and you will give them their
food in due season, brothers."

584
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:30,541
Now, I'll be back soon. And you best
have them cleaned up and ready.

585
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,446
Well, damn, babe.

586
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,314
You took for, like, ever.

587
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,284
My God,
you missed it.

588
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:42,685
Alex was like,

589
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,155
"I love you, Lorri."

590
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:47,691
He was on the bed,
laying almost on top of...

591
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:49,859
Alex was like, "I want to stick
my hot dog in your taco."

592
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,530
I'm serious.

593
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:53,864
- Do we have to do this?
- Like, kind of.

594
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,799
Really?

595
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:58,134
Hey, you're the one
that got him all pissed off.

596
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:59,837
Alex left pissed off.

597
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,142
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

598
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,045
Dead serious,
may God strike me down.

599
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,884
Bitches.

600
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:17,355
So, nobody knows
where he went?

601
00:59:18,654 --> 00:59:20,257
Nah, fuck him.

602
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,426
Classy.

603
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:36,540
Bitches!
That's all they are.

604
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:39,342
What did I do?
I just wanted a little play.

605
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:44,815
What the fuck?

606
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,041
Keep him quiet, boy.

607
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:18,982
Boy needs a little
cooling off, son.

608
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,953
Let go of me!

609
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,321
No!

610
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:44,708
So he's high, drunk,
and pissed off,

611
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,210
and you guys just let him roam
around a town he doesn't know.

612
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,378
Right?

613
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,614
He'll be fine, babe.

614
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:58,322
Okay, just stay here.
I'm going to go look for him.

615
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:04,927
Holy hell!

616
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,363
Good Lord Almighty.

617
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,335
I just come up
to tell you kids,

618
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:14,237
your friend, the big one...

619
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,273
Sheriff just took him in.

620
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:21,978
What?

621
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,181
Sheriff said he would
let him go in the morning.

622
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:29,185
Boys will be boys, but he was just
raising too much of a ruckus.

623
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:30,721
Now, good night.

624
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,826
Thanks, ma'am. I think.

625
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,028
Fuck.

626
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,069
Shit.

627
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:49,459
Fuck.

628
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:26,663
What?

629
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,201
Did you see Jeff
come in last night?

630
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:39,476
<i>Nein. I saw nassing.</i>

631
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,579
Awesome.

632
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,491
What?

633
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:57,194
Cuddle me, jerk-face.

634
01:05:02,831 --> 01:05:04,368
Better.

635
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:32,630
I'm trying.

636
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:43,741
Wait, there's no...

637
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,081
Well, aren't you
the prepared little scout.

638
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,616
You should see the rest
of the badges I earned.

639
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,063
Really?

640
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:11,268
With us five feet away?

641
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:16,440
I...

642
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:20,277
Yeah, your little pincushion
said that already.

643
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:23,112
I smell breakfast.
You bitches do what you want.

644
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:26,782
I'm going to take
a nice hot shower.

645
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:29,619
And the three of you could
probably use a cold one.

646
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,726
I thought I was
going to get a hell of a show.

647
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,127
Sorry?

648
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,632
It's all good.
You want to go get breakfast?

649
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,767
- Sure.
-Sure.

650
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,674
Ma'am.
Is this all for us?

651
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,645
Well, I figured it was
the least I could do,

652
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,615
with your friend being
"on ice," so to speak.

653
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,319
Everybody else
is at the revival anyway.

654
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:06,223
About that. Could you tell us
where the sheriff's office is?

655
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,192
We'll need to go
bail him out, I guess.

656
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,661
I wouldn't worry
none about that.

657
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,465
Sheriff will let him go just as soon as
he sobers up. Should be any time now.

658
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,835
And them other two...

659
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,170
- Jeff and Shell.
-Them.

660
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:24,141
They came through here
early this morning,

661
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,976
said they would
see you all later on.

662
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,712
Went looking for a lake
they saw on the way in.

663
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:34,685
Again? What the hell.
And are these grits?

664
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,591
Come on, baby. Let's go.

665
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,696
Come on. It'll be fun.

666
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,632
Besides, Alex probably
isn't even out yet.

667
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:50,900
Maybe we should bring him
a cake with a file in it?

668
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,784
All right. Let's go in.

669
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,196
My God.

670
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,833
-That's really...
-Cool.

671
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:26,203
-This stuff is crazy!
-Is that... Is that a buffalo?

672
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:27,904
I think it's a moose.

673
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,273
They have dresses.

674
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,743
-Morning, ma'am.
-And good morning to you.

675
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,545
I'm sorry about my friends,
they're a little loud.

676
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:37,246
Loud?

677
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,249
Y'all just let me know if I
can help you with anything.

678
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,819
Thank you, all right.
I should...

679
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:50,393
Do you think you guys could
tone it down just a touch?

680
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,096
Who, us?

681
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:53,905
My God.

682
01:08:53,906 --> 01:08:56,233
Come on, baby.
Have a little fun.

683
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:57,734
Come on, baby.
Have a little fun.

684
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:58,936
Okay, okay.

685
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,306
- Do you like it?
- No.

686
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:05,808
Okay, so I think this would be
perfect for in our kitchen,

687
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:06,942
like, right above
the buffalo head.

688
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,212
Nah.

689
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,548
It's really... I mean,
you can just... Do-do, do-do.

690
01:09:11,549 --> 01:09:12,316
No!

691
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:18,588
No.

692
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,824
Kind of looks
like your dad. A little bit.

693
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:32,768
How much?

694
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:34,505
It's not that much.

695
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,351
Please? You know you like it.

696
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:50,386
And I have
just the spot for it.

697
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:57,460
-There you go.
-Thank you.

698
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:04,167
Got yourself a good man there,
young lady. Don't let him go.

699
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,737
Who, me? No. He belongs to
little dancing queen over there.

700
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:15,978
I see.
You all have a good day.

701
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,982
Let's go, guys.

702
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,200
-So?
-So, what?

703
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,668
So, what now?

704
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:41,471
What's the plan,
fearless leader?

705
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:44,374
My plan is to go back
to the hotel,

706
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,977
pack my stuff, and...

707
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:51,080
You want to finish
that sentence?

708
01:10:51,114 --> 01:10:53,584
It's Alex. I guess the sheriff
let him out.

709
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,353
So, where is he?

710
01:10:57,387 --> 01:11:02,993
Says he...
He's been out looking for us.

711
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:05,863
Over by the church now. He says
he wants Lorri to come meet him.

712
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:09,565
He wants to apologize
for last night.

713
01:11:10,365 --> 01:11:11,467
My ass.

714
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:16,239
What about Jeff and Shell?

715
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:19,575
He says they're back
at the hotel, waiting on us.

716
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,945
I guess they're packing, I...

717
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,513
I think you should just come
back to the hotel with us,

718
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:27,083
and he can meet us there,
and apologize,

719
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:28,884
or whatever it is
he wants to do.

720
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:32,222
Look, I know he's a dipshit,
but I was really hard on him.

721
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:35,458
Besides, maybe
he's actually sorry.

722
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,092
Look, I'll just go over
to the church and get him,

723
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:38,628
and I'll meet you guys
back at the hotel.

724
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,030
We can all leave together
from there.

725
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:42,531
If you say so.

726
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:44,401
Let's go, okay. Come on.

727
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,607
Straight people are weird.

728
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:57,813
So what happened
to Jeff's phone anyway?

729
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,584
I guess the dumbass
dropped it in the lake.

730
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:05,822
Quit it. Stop.

731
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,060
Quit it.

732
01:12:10,093 --> 01:12:12,262
I just want to finish what
we started this morning.

733
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,669
-We could do it now.
-Come on.

734
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:28,311
What are you doing?

735
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:30,480
Are you nuts, bitch?
Get your hands off our stuff.

736
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:34,017
Blake!

737
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,687
My apologies, boys.

738
01:12:39,187 --> 01:12:41,223
I thought they'd
snatched you up already.

739
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,963
Got to clean the place up,
you know.

740
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:50,299
-Lee?
-It's okay.

741
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,119
You're making this way too
easy for him, you know.

742
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,856
Well, we can't all be
as tough as you.

743
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,292
Besides, it's not like I have a
line of guys trying to get with me.

744
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:18,628
He's not that bad. I mean,
that one Valentine's Day

745
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,130
when I didn't have a date,
he got me a teddy bear.

746
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:23,700
I just... Why not give him
another shot? He's not...

747
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:24,968
Yeah, but it's Alex.

748
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,038
I know, I know, but I'm not going
to let him treat me like shit.

749
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,907
I don't deserve it, and I'm just not
going to let him get away with it.

750
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:33,877
Besides, I know
this is a big shock to you,

751
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,846
but I like sex, and it's been
a really long time.

752
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:38,915
Besides, he's not that bad.

753
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:45,588
Is he supposed to be here?

754
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,856
I guess, I don't know.

755
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:49,459
Really? Son of a bitch.

756
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,663
I bet you
he is back at the hotel,

757
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:57,366
and you're off wandering around
following him like a little puppy.

758
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,936
-He wouldn't do that to us.
-Yes, he would, he's Alex.

759
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,937
Yeah, I know. He said
the back of the church, right?

760
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:04,206
-Yeah, well, he lied.
-Maybe there's another church.

761
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,009
A church in a town
of six people!

762
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,477
I don't know,
I don't live here. Alex?

763
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,280
Alex!

764
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,585
Alex!

765
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,154
Afternoon, sisters.

766
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:21,124
Hi! I...

767
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:24,060
I don't want to bother you, but
we're looking for a friend of ours.

768
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,361
He was supposed
to meet us here.

769
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:29,098
No bother at all.
Maybe I can help you find him.

770
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:31,366
I mean, is he here?
Is he inside, maybe?

771
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,437
Probably easier
if I just showed you.

772
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,139
Run! Run!

773
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:50,654
Lorri!

774
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,090
Lorri! Lorri! Lorri! Lorri!

775
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:57,494
Lorri! Lorri!

776
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,495
- No!
- Hold on.

777
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,164
Lorri!

778
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:37,699
"And thou shalt kill
the bullock before the Lord,

779
01:15:37,732 --> 01:15:40,736
"by the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation.

780
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:49,344
"And he took the blood, and sprinkled
it on the people and said,

781
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:55,752
"'Behold, the blood of the covenant
which the Lord hath made with you.'"

782
01:15:58,486 --> 01:16:00,356
These are lean times,
brothers.

783
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:07,830
This one will serve us well.

784
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:11,000
Bring them both.

785
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:58,615
You see, little sister, we must
be prepared in times like these.

786
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:10,693
We would be remiss in our faith if
we were to pass up such a bounty

787
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,996
when the Lord has laid it
at our doorstep.

788
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,890
"A righteous man cares
for the needs of his flock.

789
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,226
"We care for our flock.

790
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,995
"We watch over it willingly,
not grudgingly.

791
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,632
"Not for what we will
receive, but because..."

792
01:17:49,664 --> 01:17:52,067
"But because we are eager
to serve our Lord."

793
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:55,571
No, no, no, don't you worry.

794
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,142
Don't you worry.

795
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:02,011
I have no intentions on
you suffering such a fate.

796
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:06,816
But we must make thee
ready to serve the flock.

797
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:31,566
-These the last two?
-Yes, sir. A couple of queers.

798
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,902
- This one, too?
- Yes, Daddy.

799
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:38,340
Such a polite young man, too.

800
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:41,944
I say we take them outside, set
a fire, and be done with it.

801
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:43,413
Quiet, boy.

802
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,046
We can't feed them
to our flock.

803
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:48,049
Meat that touches anything
unclean must not be eaten,

804
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,185
it must be burned up.

805
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:52,222
Do not preach to me, boy!

806
01:19:52,987 --> 01:19:54,824
You forget your place.

807
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:03,799
Brother Simon, do you think
these two might be saved?

808
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,569
That I do not know, brother.

809
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:11,773
I mean, can they truly
be cleansed of their sin?

810
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,143
How can you think about
letting them live?

811
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:19,081
We cannot let them pollute our
town, our land, our people.

812
01:20:20,915 --> 01:20:24,820
Like a muddied spring
or a polluted well

813
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,423
are the righteous
who give way to the wicked.

814
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:32,862
I want you to try, brother.

815
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:46,142
This is not the time or the place
to have this conversation.

816
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:49,744
This is exactly the place
to have this conversation.

817
01:20:49,777 --> 01:20:52,781
It's because of what
you're about to do!

818
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:59,188
I'm not sure you understand the
predicament you're in here, son.

819
01:21:00,955 --> 01:21:05,127
Now, if you can repent,

820
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,864
if you can show us a sign
that you can live here...

821
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,494
It's the only way?

822
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,896
I'm afraid so, son.

823
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,670
You haven't seen how beautiful
things are here.

824
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:49,705
You could be truly happy.

825
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:55,444
After a while, a wife,
maybe some children.

826
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:00,682
It's the only way.
You have to see the light.

827
01:22:01,749 --> 01:22:03,051
What the fuck are you doing?

828
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:05,855
Maybe they're right.

829
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:14,230
Maybe my grandfather
was right.

830
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,303
What kind of life can we have?

831
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:24,106
It's not like
we can get married.

832
01:22:25,975 --> 01:22:27,310
And kids?

833
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:30,547
What do we have?

834
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,581
Pets?

835
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:36,585
It's not any kind of life.

836
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,822
Not really.

837
01:22:45,893 --> 01:22:49,097
Are you sure, son?
You have to be sure.

838
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,333
Blake!

839
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,906
Please.

840
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:02,445
How can you do this to me?

841
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:05,514
How can you do this to us?

842
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:08,284
Because I'm tired!

843
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:10,820
I'm tired, Lee.

844
01:23:12,855 --> 01:23:13,755
I'm tired of always
being the joke,

845
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:17,660
and the outcast.

846
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:22,431
And I don't want to have to
look over my shoulder

847
01:23:22,463 --> 01:23:23,665
every time
I want to touch you,

848
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:28,538
-or kiss you...
-Stop. Please stop.

849
01:23:29,937 --> 01:23:31,340
...or love you.

850
01:23:34,942 --> 01:23:37,045
You have to
say it aloud.

851
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,482
Admit your sin.

852
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:45,321
That's the only way
you can seek forgiveness.

853
01:23:46,954 --> 01:23:50,158
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

854
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,730
I think I always knew
it was wrong.

855
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,495
You know what
has to be done, brother.

856
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:27,397
I do.

857
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,048
I am so sorry.

858
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,888
I love you.

859
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:07,436
You just killed yourself, boy!
Brahm! Isaac!

860
01:25:07,468 --> 01:25:09,571
Shut the fuck up!

861
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:12,407
You self-righteous
piece of shit.

862
01:25:35,496 --> 01:25:38,801
Didn't think you were gonna get
rid of me that easy, did you?

863
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:42,804
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

864
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,954
Simon! Simon!

865
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:01,724
I told you!

866
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:13,101
-They're gone.
-Well, that's apparent, boy.

867
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:16,638
-They're gone!
-Yes, they are.

868
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,776
You take care of that one,
I'll go tell his mother.

869
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:30,153
I'm sorry, Bud.

870
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,892
The Lord is with you. Just go.
Just go.

871
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:47,003
How many people have died
because we've listened to you?

872
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,005
We've spilt our blood.

873
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:52,208
It's on your head.

874
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,009
Watch your tongue, boy!

875
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,012
It's on your head!

876
01:26:57,044 --> 01:26:59,981
You had to try to save
those unrepentant sinners.

877
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:02,718
You knew,
you knew I was right,

878
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,487
but you wouldn't let me
lay down His judgment.

879
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:26,909
"When you do wrong, be afraid.

880
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:30,078
"For he does not
bear the sword in vain.

881
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:34,850
"For he is a servant of the Lord,
an avenger for His wrath."

882
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:41,223
Men, take him to the church
and gather the congregation.

883
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,093
I'll be along shortly.

884
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:47,329
How dare you?
Get your hands off of me!

885
01:27:47,361 --> 01:27:49,297
Let me go! Stop!

886
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:55,871
Shit!

887
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:58,975
-What do we do now?
-We run, and we don't stop.

888
01:28:00,374 --> 01:28:01,476
Now.

889
01:28:16,258 --> 01:28:20,763
There are those
destined and determined

890
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,999
to walk straight
into the grinder,

891
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:28,036
<i>and they cannot be saved.</i>

892
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:32,206
The ovens are hot, and they are
waiting for them, brethren.

893
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,911
We do not mourn them.
We do not shed a single tear.

894
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:39,781
Do we cry for the wheat that
puts our bread on the table?

895
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,317
<i>No, friends.</i>

896
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:46,120
They are meant to be fodder
for His true disciples.

897
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:49,926
We have been led astray. We have
been led astray by a false prophet.

898
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:54,929
Now I, out of any of us,

899
01:28:54,963 --> 01:28:59,401
feel this betrayal to the
depths of my very living soul.

900
01:28:59,433 --> 01:29:04,306
Each one of you have
faithfully obeyed the voice,

901
01:29:04,338 --> 01:29:09,277
but, you see,
a man is justified by works,

902
01:29:09,311 --> 01:29:10,947
and not by faith alone.

903
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:19,388
Please, please, brethren,
be seated!

904
01:29:27,728 --> 01:29:31,133
We are being tested, brethren.

905
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:37,105
We have to return to the true
path, and this is the way.

906
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:41,342
Trust in the body and blood and
forever eat at the table of our Lord.

907
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:46,114
Deny it, and be cast down
with the curs and rats.

908
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:52,053
They are not worthy to eat but the
scraps and bones tossed unto the dirt.

909
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:57,558
Remember, friends,
it is not me

910
01:29:57,592 --> 01:30:00,529
that is calling out to you
to pick up the sword.

911
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:06,168
It is He Himself
that commands you.

912
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:10,072
We're being tested!

913
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:12,840
If I am wrong,
let Him stay my hand.

914
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:15,144
If I am wrong,
let Him strike me down!

915
01:30:15,177 --> 01:30:17,580
I welcome
His righteous retribution.

916
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:24,887
There is no other way but His,

917
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:29,758
and there is
no other truth but His.

918
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:38,100
We offer up this sacrifice,

919
01:30:40,035 --> 01:30:42,371
and hope that once again

920
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:48,110
He may rain
His blessings down upon us.

921
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:03,893
Damn it!

922
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,127
Lee!

923
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,630
I said don't stop.
We have to get out of here.

924
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:12,168
No, look.

925
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,482
Shit! The keys!

926
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:37,726
"Dumb idea to have
a spare under the car,"

927
01:31:37,758 --> 01:31:39,927
"Somebody will just
steal it,"

928
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:43,331
You were so right. Now will
you unlock my goddamn door

929
01:31:43,365 --> 01:31:45,434
so we can get out of here,
please?

930
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:48,937
Hurry!
