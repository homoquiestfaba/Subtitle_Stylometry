885
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:10,948
I ASSURE YOU 'TIS NOT OPEN
SEASON ON ARCHEOLOGISTS.

886
01:30:10,948 --> 01:30:14,452
I AM SO SORRY.

887
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:18,414
I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE
CHANGED A FEW THINGS BILLY.

888
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:24,921
DAD, I THINK I KNOW WHERE
YOU CAN FIND THE MEDALLION.

889
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:40,645
[MUSIC]

890
01:30:40,645 --> 01:30:42,480
KING HUGO'S EMBLEM.

891
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:50,113
[MUSIC]

892
01:30:50,113 --> 01:30:52,824
(DANIEL - STORYTELLER) BILLY'S DAD WAS
GRATEFUL TO HAVE FOUND THE MEDALLION,

893
01:30:52,824 --> 01:30:54,951
BUT REALIZED THAT
THE GREATER TREASURE

894
01:30:54,951 --> 01:30:58,287
WAS HAVING BILLY
AS A SON.

895
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:02,792
AS FOR THE KIDS;
PRINCE HUKO DISCOVERED

896
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:07,338
THAT GREATNESS COMES WHEN
YOU LOVE AND SERVE OTHERS.

897
01:31:07,338 --> 01:31:11,717
AND HE HELPED HIS PEOPLE BY
PUTTING THEM ABOVE HIMSELF.

898
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:27,859
AND ALLIE, SHE LEARNED THAT
NO ONE IS AN ACCIDENT TO GOD,

899
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:33,364
AND THAT HE HAS AN INCREDIBLE
PURPOSE FOR EVERYONE,

900
01:31:33,364 --> 01:31:35,283
EVEN BRAVE LITTLE GIRLS.

901
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:44,000
AND BILLY.

902
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,504
BILLY LEARNED THAT HIS
GREATEST VALUE CAME FROM GOD.

903
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:52,049
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING HE COULD EVER DO,

904
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:55,970
WAS TO TRUST HIS HEART TO
THE ONE WHO CREATED IT.

905
01:31:59,682 --> 01:32:02,310
MY HEART
IS MY MEDALLION.

906
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:09,066
YOU ARE A VERY
SMART BOY.

907
01:32:15,615 --> 01:32:19,202
DON'T EVER FORGET
THAT GOD LOVES YOU,

908
01:32:19,202 --> 01:32:21,120
MORE THAN YOU
COULD EVER KNOW.

909
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:34,175
THANK YOU, DANIEL.
THAT WAS QUITE A STORY.

910
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:36,552
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

911
01:32:36,552 --> 01:32:39,597
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I JUST
MADE IT UP AS I WENT ALONG.

912
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:41,432
WELL IT WAS PERFECT.

913
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:43,684
I JUST HATE THAT YOU
MISSED YOUR GAME, THOUGH.

914
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:46,521
I DON'T.

915
01:32:46,521 --> 01:32:48,648
THIS DID MORE FOR ME
THAN ANY GAME EVER COULD.

916
01:32:57,156 --> 01:33:01,577
DON'T EVER GIVE UP
ON THEM.

917
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:02,578
I NEVER GAVE UP ON YOU,

918
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:04,121
DID I DANNY,
WHEN YOU WERE HERE?

919
01:33:10,753 --> 01:33:13,798
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

920
01:33:13,798 --> 01:33:17,718
DON'T STAY AWAY
SO LONG OKAY?

921
01:33:17,718 --> 01:33:21,389
IF MS. JESSIE EVER CAN'T
MAKE IT TUESDAY, CALL ME.

922
01:33:21,389 --> 01:33:22,223
OK.

923
01:33:32,942 --> 01:33:35,820
THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME
ALL THOSE YEARS.

924
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:39,365
ISN'T THAT WHY
WE'RE HERE?
