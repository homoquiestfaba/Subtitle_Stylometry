1
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,339
This is my bath water.

2
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,318
There it is,
going down the drain.

3
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,150
My soap.

4
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,554
My passport,
with no occupation on it...

5
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,353
but I'm a film editor.

6
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,360
That's my Nagra 3.

7
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,955
Actually, it's not mine.
I'm borrowing it from work.

8
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:43,196
I'm borrowing this film, too,
because I'm shooting everything.

9
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,067
This is the little fern
that Marlene and I bought...

10
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,606
when we first moved in together.

11
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,370
Wow, it's grown.
It's just been a few months.

12
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,934
I bought these shoes for her.

13
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,810
They do not fit her
and she still wears them.

14
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,345
This is my strong French coffee.

15
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,254
And this is...really stupid.

16
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,554
Or is it? I don't know.
Start again.

17
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,254
Paris, September 1st, 1969.

18
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,058
Time is 9:30.

19
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,827
These are pieces of me.

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,697
Me in pieces.

21
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,033
I'm trying to find
what's real, what's honest.

22
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,073
The total opposite of the film
I'm editing...

23
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,507
which is a sci-fi picture
about a secret agent...

24
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,237
Codename: Dragonfly.

25
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,746
Bonjour.

26
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,406
Wake up. Wake up.

27
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,178
Rise and shine, Dragonfly.

28
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,483
It is time for you to wake up.

29
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,887
It is a beautiful day today.

30
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:50,425
You have many secret missions
to accomplish today.

31
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,897
It's so early.

32
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:58,034
It is 2:00 in the afternoon,
Dragonfly.

33
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,279
Can't I sleep?

34
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,475
I never get to sleep.

35
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,849
Would you like to hear
your horoscope?

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,217
It's good today.

37
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,917
Mystery will be revealed
when the moon makes its orbit.

38
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,950
I love a mystery.

39
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,124
Fly

40
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,565
Dragonfly

41
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:25,798
Seek you out from undercover

42
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,966
Could you be my lover?

43
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,603
Together we can fly

44
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,613
Together we can fly

45
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,479
Fly

46
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,252
The water's freezing.

47
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,759
We are making cinema together!

48
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,664
We are making revolution!

49
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,865
Did I ever tell you that I was
the one who discovered her?

50
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,649
You're wonderful. Oh, yes.

51
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,953
Like that. Yes.

52
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,287
Very good.

53
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,617
This is Marlene sleeping.

54
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,890
She's mad at me today.

55
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,090
I asked her if she passed
her driving test.

56
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,600
Don't you think I would tell you
if I had passed?

57
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,567
Leave me alone!

58
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,629
Yesterday she was happy.

59
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,954
Everything is important.

60
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,752
It's all in the details,
they say.

61
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,817
This is the beginning
of a new cinema.

62
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:02,825
It's so delicious.

63
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,920
It's personal,
but not pretentious.

64
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,988
-It was beautiful.
-Definitive.

65
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,296
It's such an emotion
to see a film like that.

66
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,701
-Daring. Mature.
-Why are you in Paris?

67
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,932
-Which vitamin do you prefer?
-Let him speak.

68
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,440
Gentlemen, we can find out
more about a man by his dreams.

69
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,774
I guess I've always been
a bit of a daydreamer.

70
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,905
Always interested in film.

71
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,040
A lot my thoughts...

72
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,051
my little notions
of things and feelings...

73
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,246
are like little scenes
in my head.

74
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,221
I guess I want to show people
what I think about.

75
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,780
What I think is touching
or sad or funny...

76
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,259
Oops. I didn't realize
you were filming.

77
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,853
It sounded like
you were talking to yourself.

78
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,865
Just because you film every
possible thing in your life...

79
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,801
doesn't mean you'll understand
yourself any better.

80
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,772
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

81
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,705
Go ahead. Turn it on.

82
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,647
Go ahead. Tell me.

83
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,116
You're a warm person...

84
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,552
but closed off emotionally.

85
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,183
You're self-absorbed
and live in a fantasy world.

86
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,990
-Come on.
-Let me talk. It's true.

87
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,553
You've come to Paris
to find your life...

88
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,830
but it is in front of you,
and you won't admit it.

89
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,371
You film all the details
of things around you...

90
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,373
as if that would
bring some understanding.

91
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,569
I just want to capture
what's real and honest.

92
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,509
And what if it's boring?

93
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,013
Did you ever think about that?

94
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,981
It may not be interesting
for others to watch.

95
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,157
You're mad at me now,
aren't you?

96
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,990
Come on.
Let me fix your hair.

97
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,257
I'm just thinking about work.

98
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,424
We've been cutting the ending
for two weeks now.

99
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,934
The director has no idea
howto end the picture.

100
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,526
And he won't admit it.

101
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,071
Kiss me.

102
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,105
What are you thinking about?

103
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,242
She stands there,
looking at him.

104
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,745
She leans closer and says...

105
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,008
I love you.

106
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,811
And we have the ending.

107
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,976
It all comes together.

108
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,487
This shot is not finished yet.

109
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,217
They emerge from the tunnels...

110
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,782
and the sun rises...

111
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,523
and we see
she's joined the revolution.

112
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,570
And so...

113
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,671
it ends with
a simple declaration of love.

114
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,410
It ends with a beginning.

115
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,985
Yes, a circle. Circle.

116
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,388
Sort of circle.

117
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,358
It's great.

118
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,263
Is that the original ending?

119
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,232
You don't have an ending!

120
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,235
We make an action movie
with no action!

121
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,634
It doesn't make any sense!

122
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,002
I haven't shot the end yet.

123
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:40,137
My vision is to subvert
the audience expectations.

124
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,579
I want the end,
not with a bang...

125
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,947
but with a whimper.

126
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,010
No picture of mine
ever ended with a whimper!

127
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,613
We need a bang!
The picture is not watchable!

128
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,058
If you're thinking of changing
one frame of my revolution...

129
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,288
-You're off the picture!
-What?

130
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,887
Each moment I spend with you,
I'm losing money.

131
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,523
Fabrizio,
shut down this production.

132
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,567
What are you saying?

133
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,329
You're off the picture!

134
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,462
Fabrizio, I don't
want to see him ever again!

135
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,836
Go! Go away!

136
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,875
-You're afraid of this film!
-You're not director!

137
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,137
-You fascist! You go away!
-Andre!

138
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,476
It's the young actress!
She's gone to his head!

139
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:19,450
Finalmente. Eh?

140
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,849
Bullshit!

141
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,445
I have seen this happen
many times before.

142
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,683
A director falls
for the leading lady...

143
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,283
and his judgment
goes to the toilet.

144
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:33,060
Fabrizio, fire everybody
involved with this mess.

145
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,091
I have made 63 pictures,
and this is the worst.

146
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,432
See if you can bring in...
Felix DeMarco.

147
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,500
The young director.
Call him, now.

148
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,679
One, two, three, four.

149
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,314
Break on me! One, two, three!

150
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,957
Break out.
Something's not right here.

151
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,628
Felix DeMarco.

152
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,260
Now, if I'm being
totally honest...

153
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,634
which is
the point of this film...

154
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,436
just hearing his name
fills me with envy.

155
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,534
And I don't even know why
I care so much.

156
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,340
They can do whatever they want.

157
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,643
I have this film. My film.

158
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,408
So much has happened
since yesterday.

159
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,749
I lost my job.
I need to find a camera.

160
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,789
No more borrowing film.

161
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:35,486
Need to conserve stock.
Stay on track.

162
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,332
Everything's changing,
becoming clearer.

163
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,197
I feel like it might be
all over with Marlene.

164
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,969
I need some time
to figure things out.

165
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,945
Maybe we should live apart
for a little while.

166
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,073
No. It's me. It's all me.

167
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,379
She'll slip into bed
without a word...

168
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,784
without even a hello.

169
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,913
Maybe a scowl...

170
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,651
and I'm going
to stop her this time.

171
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,183
I missed him.

172
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,129
Did you miss me?

173
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,224
Yes!

174
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,667
How was your day?

175
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,738
How was your day?

176
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,571
Don't get it. Let's kiss.

177
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,446
Hello? Hey, Pippo.

178
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,444
Really? What, right now?

179
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,717
OK, OK.

180
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,028
They fired everybody
this morning...

181
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,861
and now
they just hired me back...

182
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,834
and I have to go to meet
the new director.

183
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,234
You're going now?

184
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,499
Till the weekend.

185
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,873
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,708
Call them and tell them
you'll go tomorrow.

187
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,373
There's nothing I can do.

188
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,748
I just get back,
you fucking ass!

189
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,684
Why are you leaving me
right now?

190
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,320
I'll make a nice salad for you.

191
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,985
I have to go.

192
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,401
I'm sorry. I'm going to cut.

193
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,375
Let's go again.

194
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,911
Can we get some more blood?

195
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,781
-Thanks for coming so quickly.
-Sure.

196
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,650
I'm glad you're still working
on the picture.

197
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,619
Do you knowthis young director,
Felix DeMarco?

198
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,522
Yeah, I met him before.

199
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,188
He's an ass. Over there.

200
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,356
You look very scary,
and action!

201
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:57,334
A certain number of virgins
must be given up to Satan.

202
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:01,271
I now give you to my master,
His Highness of Darkness...

203
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,676
where you will slumber forever
in the tomb of Satanic blood.

204
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,009
And...cut!
Print that one.

205
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,810
It was perfect, everyone.
Let's go to lunch.

206
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,714
Come on, baby.

207
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,514
You are getting better
and better every day.

208
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,781
Unbelievable.

209
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,756
-Enzo!
-Felix.

210
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,821
Follow me.

211
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,796
What this picture needs,
Felix, is you.

212
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,599
It needs youth,
and also...a better ending.

213
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,406
Felix, this is Paul.
He is the editor.

214
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,567
I knowthis guy.
How you doing?

215
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,907
You did sound on
the speedway picture, right?

216
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,879
I pulled cable for you.

217
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,040
I was awful at it, though.

218
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,643
Enzo, Paul's also done
the second unit on the picture.

219
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,187
Second unit.
That's fantastic.

220
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,850
Go ahead and tell Felix
the plot of the picture.

221
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,383
I would tell you myself,
but I'm lousy with English.

222
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,554
Go on.

223
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,860
It's a science fiction film
set in...

224
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,298
It's a good little idea, Felix.

225
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,630
You'll make it great.

226
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,796
Use the footage we have.
Cut here, cut there.

227
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,035
Add some action,
more of the girl. Very sexy.

228
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,770
I like it sexy, Enzo.

229
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,438
Keep telling the story.

230
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:18,381
-It's set in the future...
-The year is 2001.

231
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,816
We have one hell of a setup.

232
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,376
Real sexy stuff.

233
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,458
Go ahead, Paul. Go. Go.

234
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,584
There's a group
of revolutionaries...

235
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,925
hiding out on a moon base...

236
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,896
and there's only one answer.

237
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,830
Gentlemen, I want
to thank you for attending...

238
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,840
this emergency
security session.

239
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,934
This visual report
will illustrate our problem.

240
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,447
Recent intelligence reports...

241
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,349
indicate that a band
of youthful revolutionaries...

242
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,855
have set up a secret base
in the far out region...

243
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,322
of the dark side of the moon.

244
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,849
Their leader is a man
who's known as Mr. E.

245
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,920
His many followers
regard him as a great poet...

246
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:10,731
orator, inventor,
and expert in martial arts.

247
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,130
He appears to be leading his
group in training exercises...

248
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,143
which we believe are linked
to a plan to attack Earth...

249
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,170
to spread his dangerous
anarchistic philosophy.

250
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,376
Not since our troubles began
way back in May, 1968...

251
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:31,082
have we seen
such a cause for concern.

252
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,748
Most distressing
are the reports...

253
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,020
that he has developed
a top-secret weapon...

254
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:39,622
which we feel we must capture
to preserve our way of life.

255
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,633
Gentlemen,
we're left with only one option.

256
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,102
To use Agent Codename:
Dragonfly.

257
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,140
-But she's so expensive.
-And so difficult.

258
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,905
I know she's exasperating,
but we need her.

259
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,141
Now, I've arranged
a teleconference.

260
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,343
Please, Agent Dragonfly.
We had an appointment.

261
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,885
I need my sleep.

262
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,046
We need to get down to business.

263
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,750
OK. What is it?

264
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,520
Your mission is
to infiltrate the community...

265
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,789
by whatever means available...

266
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,799
find Mr. E, and
take possession of his weapon.

267
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,837
He's pretty cute, isn't he?

268
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,774
Please. Are you prepared
to accept this mission?

269
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,446
I'll take the mission,
but you know how much I cost.

270
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,812
Of course.

271
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,783
We're relying on you,
Dragonfly.

272
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,983
The future of the world
is in your hands.

273
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,703
So, are you prepared
to take this mission?

274
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,337
If you can meet my price.

275
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,643
That sounds like fun.
I love science fiction.

276
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,307
I could probably
make this amazing.

277
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,079
I want to tighten it up...

278
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,881
reshoot some things,
fix the ending...

279
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,854
because you don't
seem to have that...

280
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,618
and...

281
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,159
I could start once
the vampire picture wraps.

282
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,787
Perfect.
While Felix shoots...

283
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,127
we continue with the trailer
and the looping.

284
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,396
Felix, give the editor
your thoughts on the trailer.

285
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,438
Stick to Felix like glue.

286
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,565
Hear his ideas, his visions.
Write it.

287
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,905
Yes, we have to go.
We have another projection.

288
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,672
The Three Killers, no?

289
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,939
It just hit me.

290
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,313
I know howthe trailer
needs to be.

291
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,055
Are you going back to set?

292
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,566
I'll let you know if
I get any other great ideas!

293
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,195
And we're up! We're back!

294
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,468
I want two cameras
and another here with me!

295
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,735
We're going to do two!

296
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,486
So, we finally meet.

297
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,560
I like what I see.

298
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,474
-I'm Paul.
-Valentine.

299
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,600
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

300
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,238
The director's still on his way.

301
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,339
I'll just get us set up
in the meantime.

302
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,883
Sorry about my voice.

303
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,942
My apartment's flooding.
I'm getting a cold.

304
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,749
You'll be fine. Maybe it's...

305
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,560
I was just...

306
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,464
I was just...

307
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,759
-Would you like some tea?
-Yeah.

308
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,429
Paul...Felix is missing.

309
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,995
Go ahead and get
the session going. Come on.

310
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,474
Yes, yes. People, come on.

311
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,602
-Ever done this before?
-No.

312
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,009
It's pretty easy.

313
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,613
There you go.

314
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,820
So, we finally meet.

315
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,865
I like what I see.

316
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,166
I have a mission,
which I intend to accomplish.

317
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,143
I love you.

318
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,647
I love you.

319
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,478
I'm so in love with you.

320
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,348
Do you love me?

321
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,480
I'm in love with you.

322
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,023
I love you.

323
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,859
That's OK.

324
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,123
Changing rolls. Sorry.

325
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:50,198
You have an eyelash right here.

326
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,244
If you blow on it,
you can make a wish.

327
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,045
I wish cats could talk.

328
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,082
You're not supposed to tell me.
It won't come true.

329
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,189
I'm sure it'll come true.

330
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,853
My cat's pregnant.

331
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,557
I wish I could talk to her.

332
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,133
-Can I get you to sign this?
-Sure.

333
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,377
You must be the director.

334
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,042
How exactly
you want me to do this?

335
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:36,315
With a lot of authority,
or maybe more playful?

336
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:42,454
Who is Dragonfly?
She's a super-sexy secret agent.

337
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,893
But that's top secret.

338
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,158
Dragonfly is coming.

339
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,826
-How do you like it? Good?
-It's great.

340
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,199
You hear me? One, two, three.

341
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,467
You hear me?
Dazzling? It's OK.

342
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,065
Dazzling is terrific.
Dragonfly is terrific.

343
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,111
-Everything else good.
-It's great.

344
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,579
Thank you. Thanks.
Just try them.

345
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,946
Where'd she go?

346
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,780
Out that way.

347
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,582
Who is Dragonfly?

348
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,898
Hi, Valentine.
Felix DeMarco, the director.

349
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,338
How are you?
Sorry I'm late.

350
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,841
I'm just...crazy.

351
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,342
Actually,
we already finished.

352
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,539
Oh, great.
Want to get a bite to eat?

353
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,672
Sure.

354
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,308
-Do you have any francs?
-Yeah. I do.

355
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:43,582
I'm fresh out.
I know a little great place.

356
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,852
Do you use The Method?

357
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,923
Do we have to do this now?

358
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,589
Yeah. That's the thing.

359
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:56,225
I have to do it,
even if I don't want to.

360
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,929
It's the only way
to be honest and real.

361
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,632
Have you seen my light meter?

362
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,874
You didn't tell me your father
was coming for Christmas.

363
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,385
I'm sorry. I forgot.
He's on a lecture tour.

364
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,047
Just be passing through
the airport for an hour or two.

365
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,885
Asked me to meet him there.

366
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,152
You never tell me anything.

367
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:29,191
What was the actress like?

368
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,635
She's a nice girl.

369
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,535
And?

370
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,403
Am I in frame?

371
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,119
Today is December 20th, 1969.

372
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,747
I have to stay focused.
Complete honesty.

373
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,051
Do you love me?

374
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,053
You know how I feel about you.

375
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,426
You just want me to say it
in front of my camera?

376
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,023
Why can't you just say it?

377
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:07,504
I sew your ripped pants.
I trip over your camera.

378
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,802
I love you, of course.

379
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:14,334
I just don't
want to run out of film.

380
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,807
What are you looking for?

381
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,408
What do you mean?

382
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,715
What is your biggest wish?

383
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,894
That cats could talk.

384
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,226
Something that girl said,
isn't it?

385
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,493
What are you talking about?
You're being silly.

386
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,365
I thought you had to be
totally honest in this film.

387
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,233
I am.

388
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,797
You're being ridiculous.

389
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,569
Who said that? That actress?

390
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,372
You want to sleep with her!

391
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,811
-Now, that's ridiculous.
-What is your problem?

392
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,406
I can't believe you!
I just don't understand!

393
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,247
We need to talk.

394
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,425
Hey, Paul.
Ready to go to the party?

395
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,835
Let me drive.

396
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,104
Did you pass
your driving test finally?

397
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,753
Maybe you can drive
on the way home.

398
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,692
I got a call from the hospital.

399
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,096
Felix was in a car accident.

400
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,498
Smashed up his Alfa.

401
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,560
The doctor said he was OK.

402
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,970
Just broke his leg.

403
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,906
He's getting out of
the Dragonfly picture...

404
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,273
taking a break.

405
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,209
-Really?
-Yeah.

406
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,146
I want to recommend you to Enzo.

407
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,276
Me?

408
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,583
I think
you should finish the film.

409
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,582
I know you can do a good job.
You're a talented kid.

410
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,628
You have helped
the picture a lot.

411
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,958
I have seen that...

412
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,725
in the second unit shots
I have gotten.

413
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,701
The footage
of the cosmic rays...

414
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,304
that was your idea.

415
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,350
It's a good idea.

416
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,984
We talk to him tomorrow.

417
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,262
It is sonic boom
of the Concorde.

418
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,427
It's so fucking amazing.
We're living in the future, man.

419
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,496
...acting is to the scenario.

420
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,200
I found this great place
in St. Germain.

421
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,174
Would you excuse me one second?

422
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,211
I've got some big news.

423
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,839
Can't you see I'm talking
to someone right now?

424
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,314
Give me two minutes.

425
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,544
Excuse me,
you were saying?

426
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,484
It's called
theater of revolution.

427
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,717
It's going to be a movement,
a voice, a poetry workshop.

428
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,588
I'm sure you'd love this place.

429
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,060
-Did you hear about poor Felix?
-I hope he's OK.

430
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,722
He's so talented.

431
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,959
Working with him
is so much fun.

432
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,058
I remember once,
when we finished early...

433
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,899
and he took us all
to the go-kart ride.

434
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,804
Oh, God! Come here.

435
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,139
-That nobody can deny...
-Hey, babe!

436
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,476
For he's a jolly good fellow

437
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,243
For he's a jolly good fellow

438
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,750
It's Felix DeMarco!

439
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,548
That nobody can deny

440
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,248
That nobody can deny

441
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,120
Thank you. Thank you.
So kind.

442
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,025
Ladies and gentlemen...

443
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,928
I'd like
to make an announcement.

444
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,295
I'm sure
you've probably heard...

445
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,527
about the mad events
of this evening...

446
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,660
but we're OK, right?

447
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:10,197
But there's one more thing
that happened.

448
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,904
I asked Brigit to marry me...

449
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,711
and she said yes!

450
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:23,117
And so, we can't wait
one moment further...

451
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,622
and we're
setting sail tomorrow.

452
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,029
Don't stand around
staring at us!

453
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,466
Let's dance!

454
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,314
Dad. Dad.

455
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,753
Hey, you all right?

456
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,054
Yeah. I misplaced my glasses
on the plane.

457
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,219
Thank you very much.

458
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,922
Let me hold your hand.

459
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,069
Hold on. Wait.

460
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,370
I took a sleeping pill,
and I ate all the ice cream.

461
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,213
It's good to see you.

462
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:28,184
Good to see you at Christmas,
even briefly.

463
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,051
Wait a second.
I brought you something.

464
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:35,852
Thanks, Dad.

465
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,629
I had a dream the other night...

466
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,188
and I thought of you.

467
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,202
Well, you were in it.

468
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,170
I was watching these...

469
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,368
hideous films of Vietnam
on the television.

470
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:55,538
And I had
this deep, desultory dream...

471
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,344
where I met a son
that I didn't know I had.

472
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,550
And he looked like you.

473
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:07,250
You were there, too.
Two brothers.

474
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:12,058
But then I realized that
he was a soldier in the war.

475
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,258
And when I woke up,
I had these...

476
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:20,396
these feelings
of worry and of loss.

477
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,234
And I wondered...

478
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,071
this is curious...

479
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,008
could I have had a child
by another woman...

480
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,239
and never known about it?

481
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,782
Isn't that a curious thought?

482
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,781
I think about it
sometimes and...

483
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,551
What if I met a boy
and he looked like you?

484
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,558
Maybe it's really my son.

485
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,396
Sometimes I'll be driving
down the street...

486
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,026
and I'll see someone
who looks familiar...

487
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,230
like it could be my brother.

488
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,296
You know?

489
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,274
So, maybe it's true, Dad.

490
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,637
It is possible, Paul.

491
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,013
I wasn't always faithful
to your mother.

492
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,118
When I was your age...

493
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,419
all I could think about
was women.

494
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,857
It was like a disease
or a curse.

495
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,122
I think I know
what you mean, Dad.

496
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,545
Kids are nice.

497
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,648
When do you think
you'll have some of your own?

498
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,079
I don't know, Dad.

499
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,059
Have you thought about
coming back home?

500
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,822
Your mother wanted me
to ask you.

501
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,419
I don't know.

502
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,466
Excuse me.
We found your glasses.

503
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,467
Oh, thank you.

504
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,503
Thank you very much.

505
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,764
Wow.

506
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,447
I think it's time to go.

507
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,185
I'm very glad for you, Paul.

508
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,915
I know you'll do well
in this new job of yours.

509
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,547
What is it?

510
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,353
It's a science-fiction film...

511
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:25,157
about a futuristic spy
named Dragonfly.

512
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,288
That's interesting.

513
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,697
Your grandmother
used to call dragonflies...

514
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,564
the Devil's darning needles.

515
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,967
She told me that
they come in the night...

516
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,902
and stitch up your mouth
if you use profanity...

517
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,530
or were otherwise voluble.

518
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,131
This isn't exactly about that.

519
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,643
Maybe you can use it somehow.

520
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:41,837
Thanks, Dad.

521
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,211
You never know when
some little overheard story...

522
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,251
or image can find a place
in your work.

523
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,949
Here.

524
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,763
-OK, see you.
-See you.

525
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,200
How was it seeing your father?

526
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,701
It was nice.

527
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,261
He told me about
this strange dream that he had.

528
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,967
I'm going out to get some milk.

529
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,567
Action!

530
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,606
Give me some screaming, girls.

531
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,268
Louder!

532
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,108
Now give me some moaning.

533
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,781
Louder!

534
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,977
You did good work
on the trailer.

535
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,041
Thank you, sir.

536
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,281
Fabrizio says you know
the space picture...

537
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,118
better than anyone else...

538
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,422
and thinks you should take over.

539
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,088
He usually knows
what he's talking about.

540
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,664
So, you make some shorts,
films, things like that?

541
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,366
-I'm working on a film.
-Come here.

542
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,971
Now, there are
two kinds of movies.

543
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,414
Those with an ending,
and those without an ending.

544
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,576
This movie needs an ending.

545
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,711
I've made some fifty pictures...

546
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,813
and this is my advice...

547
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,758
the ending is the most important
part of the movie.

548
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,591
The part that people remember
when they leave the theater...

549
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,463
but everybody works on it last
when they are exhausted.

550
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,661
So, listen to me...

551
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,899
and figure out
howto end this picture...

552
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,838
with an exciting twist.

553
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,432
And that we can do it
in two days.

554
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,568
Yes, that we can shoot
in two days!

555
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,244
I'll be in Rome
for the holidays...

556
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,443
and Fabrizio
will get you out there...

557
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,179
and you can show me
what you're thinking.

558
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,482
Francheschino!

559
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,888
And you...astonish me.

560
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,113
I'll have a cocktail.

561
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,524
Your cocktail is ready,
Dragonfly.

562
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,881
Attention, all comrades.

563
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,426
We will soon be ready
to leave our lunar domes...

564
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,258
to descend
and bring change to Earth.

565
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,462
We need to be free...

566
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,902
to make love all day.

567
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,601
Every day.

568
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,575
Must be free.

569
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,318
So...we finally meet.

570
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,487
I like what I see.

571
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,492
I've been expecting you.

572
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,391
Hope you're not disappointed.

573
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,986
I knew it was only
a matter of time...

574
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,725
before they sent in
Agent Codename: Dragonfly.

575
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,427
You've got quite a reputation.

576
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,494
Really? Tell me about it.

577
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,666
Work with the revolution,
Dragonfly. Join us.

578
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,767
I have a mission...

579
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,778
which I intend to accomplish.

580
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,874
There she is!

581
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,304
Fabulous.

582
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,290
Preparing boosters.

583
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,433
Stand by.

584
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,432
There she is!

585
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,714
There's
too many loose ends here.

586
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,447
This gun...

587
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,047
What is so special
about this gun?

588
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,888
We got a Christmas gift.

589
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,986
Have a look.

590
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,497
It's a present from the guys
in the screening room.

591
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,055
What a temper.

592
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,601
Andrezej was so mad that day.

593
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:53,108
The mysterious, dark figure.
Who should that be?

594
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,576
Paul, relax.
It's just a movie.

595
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:58,513
I can't find reel seven here.

596
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,049
What is this?

597
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,252
Oh, Madonna.

598
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,259
Paul, reel seven.

599
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,234
It will take me days
to put it back together.

600
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,794
A message.

601
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,203
It's written in the code
from the movie.

602
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,639
Yeah. Film 37.

603
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,138
Checking code book.

604
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,444
All right. D-e...

605
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,609
"Defilers beware.

606
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,313
"Defilers beware,
exclamation point?"

607
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,824
Who sent this?

608
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,451
Andrezej.

609
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:48,021
Oh, God, Andrezej.
It has to be him.

610
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,727
He has a key to the door.
This is bad news.

611
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,770
Damn. I knew it. He's crazy!

612
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,464
And you know what?

613
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,007
I'm sure he cut the brakes
on Felix's car.

614
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,043
Jesus. You know...

615
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,111
I'm calling the locksmith.

616
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,410
You know what?
You better watch out, Paul.

617
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,689
Damn. He's crazy. I knew it!

618
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,385
He cut the film
in a million pieces.

619
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,066
I want to see your soul
in action.

620
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,498
I love you.

621
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,266
Take your time. Not so fast.

622
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,036
-I love you.
-Like that, yes.

623
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,576
Say "I'm in love with you."

624
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,906
I'm in love with you.

625
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,174
-One more time.
-Shut up.

626
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,840
Transmission breach.

627
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,953
Need assistance.

628
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,888
Need assistance.
Ship's been damaged.

629
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,663
Hey, you got my message.

630
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,499
Come in.

631
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,104
It must be freezing out.

632
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,407
I've tried everything
to fix this...

633
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,913
but I can't figure out
how it goes back together.

634
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,710
Let me take a look.

635
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,075
You look cold.

636
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,880
I'm all right now.

637
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,078
We'll be out of here in no time.

638
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,122
What are you doing on the moon?

639
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,713
I don't know.

640
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,622
I think I'm lost.

641
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,800
Dragonfly...

642
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,928
what happens in the end?

643
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:17,337
I don't know, but don't worry.

644
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,204
We're going to find out soon.

645
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:39,380
Hey, what happened?

646
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,118
Are you OK?

647
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,717
Was someone here?

648
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,922
I'm just sad.

649
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,536
I'm losing all my patience
with you.

650
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,046
You talk to your camera
night and days...

651
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,050
but you never talk to me.

652
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,647
Why don't
you say anything to me?

653
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:20,361
What should I say?

654
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,159
I don't know what to say.

655
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,297
I'm sorry you're sad.

656
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,577
Come here.

657
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,331
I don't know what I'm doing.

658
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:01,728
I don't know
if I have any ideas.

659
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:04,797
They want something that
I'm not sure I can give them.

660
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:10,436
Maybe I should just go to Rome
and tell them...

661
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,074
"I don't know what to do
with your idiotic story."

662
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,553
It's not even my film.

663
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,850
And this ending...

664
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,191
Paul, I'm glad
you're saying all this to me...

665
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,130
but I don't care about
the stupid film.

666
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,032
I care about us
like we used to be.

667
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,694
Come here. Come here.

668
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,931
Now go.

669
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,440
Go to Rome.
Do what you like...

670
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:42,342
but just remember that you
bring everything upon yourself.

671
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,312
That came for you.

672
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,610
You spent all your money
on a camera.

673
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,240
You are here.

674
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,110
These are good, don't you think?

675
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,444
It's very nice.

676
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,143
Not too bad. Sit down.

677
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,586
Good, good, good.

678
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,283
OK, so...

679
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,326
do you have
a great ending for me?

680
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,462
I recut most of the picture...

681
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,122
to make it
shorter and clearer.

682
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,760
And one of my ideas
is to take Mr. E's gun...

683
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,861
and make it
a little more special...

684
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,930
so it can temporarily
freeze people.

685
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,339
Freeze people. Sounds good.

686
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,139
And that's how
they plan to take over.

687
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:01,048
What about the ending?

688
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:03,849
The alley...

689
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,048
Dragonfly's running,
chasing after the guy.

690
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,092
What happens?

691
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,423
Well...

692
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,087
I have a few ideas.

693
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,132
That's the problem.
You got too many ideas.

694
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,190
We just need one good one.

695
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:24,397
Look, son, this is
my thirty-seventh picture.

696
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,375
I've worked with some
of the best in the business...

697
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:29,435
and I've learned
a few little tricks.

698
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:33,279
One of them is to always try
to make the audience...

699
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,615
wonder what's going to happen.

700
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,120
And then at the end,
you tell them...

701
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,851
but you surprise them
a little, eh?

702
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,222
Easy.

703
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,126
Look, it's New Year's Eve.

704
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:49,632
You are going to the party.
Come with us. Let's have fun.

705
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,463
Oh, my little monster.

706
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:55,334
Julietta.
Come on, come with us.

707
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,134
Paul, go ahead to the party.

708
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,805
Have a good time.
We'll be right back.

709
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,508
Valentine!

710
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,314
There you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

711
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:22,085
Listen, I know you've been
working on that ending...

712
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:23,420
which is exciting
because it got me thinking.

713
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:27,429
This ending has to be fabulous.
I imagine a new scene.

714
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,431
I'm parachuting
down to Earth...

715
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,263
Where did you go?
You just left me standing there.

716
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,599
Excuse me.
I'm talking to my director.

717
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,677
Thank you.
I think I'll just walk.

718
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:44,993
Hold on.

719
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,562
There you go.

720
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,367
-Are you English?
-American.

721
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,964
What are you doing here?

722
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,068
I don't know.
What are you doing here?

723
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,946
My friend is waiting for a boy.
He's in the army.

724
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:02,143
They haven't seen each other
for one year.

725
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,584
He wrote her and
say that he would run away...

726
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:07,589
from the army
and meet her here tonight.

727
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,044
1970.

728
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,584
It's a whole new decade...

729
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:40,248
but it still
feels the same to me.

730
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:43,622
So, let's hear it.

731
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:48,290
So, Dragonfly's
running through the tunnel.

732
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,697
She comes to the figure
hidden in the shadows.

733
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,633
And the figure emerges.

734
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,767
And the figure...

735
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:29,256
Your book!

736
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,597
That cats could talk.

737
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,728
I thought you had to be
totally honest in this film.

738
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,777
-Absolutely pretentious.
-Indulgent.

739
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,869
You're just fucking blowing it.

740
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,177
This film is too fractured.
It's confusing.

741
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,615
It's an aggression
for your eyes, for my eyes.

742
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,846
Especially the shot
where you sit on the toilet.

743
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,514
Where's the story?
Where's the structure?

744
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,058
I don't care about this person.

745
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,025
Do you think you are clever?

746
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,652
I just wanted
to make something...

747
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,458
that would reflect
who I am, who I was.

748
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,125
It was a difficult
and confusing time.

749
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,360
What's the point?

750
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,464
What am I supposed to do?

751
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,631
And regarding that space project
you're involved in...

752
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,641
there's no snow on the moon.

753
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,801
-Wait!
-You should knowthat.

754
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,571
What should I do?

755
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,876
You need to connect things
so they make us feel something.

756
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,890
You surprised me.
I didn't see you there.

757
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:48,027
-You look beautiful.
-Thanks.

758
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:54,098
Would you please let me know if
I'm not doing something right?

759
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,644
It's my first day, so...

760
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,044
It'll be fine.

761
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:00,514
Remind me about the scene
in the story...

762
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,073
right before
the one we're shooting.

763
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,779
You...I mean, Dragonfly
had just barely escaped...

764
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:07,846
with this special gun
from the dark side of the moon.

765
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:10,722
How does my spaceship
get fixed?

766
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,853
I came to the moon
and fixed it for you.

767
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,560
Then you landed safely in Paris.

768
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,409
Landing successful.

769
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,007
Please notify the Corporation
that the mission's complete.

770
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,243
Affirmative.

771
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,794
You didn't knock.

772
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:31,533
I wanted to surprise you,
my darling.

773
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,248
Dragonfly

774
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,313
Tell me,
how can you resist her

775
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:52,054
Until your lips have kissed her

776
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:56,929
She'll be a mystery

777
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,367
Please don't try to stop me.

778
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,970
I'm sorry.

779
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:09,108
He kills me?

780
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,112
The gun doesn't work on you.

781
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,011
Why not?

782
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,346
I'll explain later,
but what happens...

783
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,181
is the gun actually
has a special property.

784
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:21,981
The revolution
depends on this weapon...

785
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,559
The gun freezes people.

786
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:28,256
Interesting.

787
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,765
So, what happens next?

788
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,198
Incoming call on cine-com.

789
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,880
Do you have possession
of the package? Please respond.

790
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,108
Affirmative.

791
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,464
I'm sorry.

792
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,563
Bring it down. You all right?

793
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,132
Sorry, I didn't realize...
I'm fine. My foot...

794
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,802
All right, we'll go again.

795
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,470
It was our fault.
Bring her up, please.

796
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:32,078
Someone stole the exposed film.

797
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,539
Paul, go.

798
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,802
Here.

799
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,529
Are you scared?

800
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:12,151
Oops.

801
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,933
-You OK?
-Yeah.

802
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,098
-You sure?
-I'm fine.

803
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:45,684
Go.

804
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:25,586
How could you betray me?

805
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,289
Destroy my artwork,
you little shit!

806
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,026
Do you think that you can
make a better ending...

807
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,568
by putting in your car chase?

808
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:36,605
What about the theme?
The story?

809
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,071
Have you
thought about that, Paul?

810
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,437
-I wasn't trying...
-Bullshit!

811
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,500
Don't move! I'm warning you!

812
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,674
I'm sorry.

813
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,618
It's a big opportunity for me...

814
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,019
You want
to knowthe real reason?

815
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:57,183
They are afraid about the film.

816
01:09:57,259 --> 01:10:00,228
They're trying to keep
the youth rebellion suppressed.

817
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:04,062
A film can change
the course of the future.

818
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:09,503
It can invent the future
by making ideas concrete.

819
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:13,030
That's why when I heard
you were changing the ending...

820
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,700
I was forced to do this.

821
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,039
I had an idea.

822
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:18,978
I had a new idea for the ending,
that maybe she...

823
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,916
the Corporation, its center,
betrays her.

824
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:34,558
The revolutionary get
their weapon back in the end.

825
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,258
Promise me that, Paul.

826
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,995
I promise.

827
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:48,540
Good.

828
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,178
I've been working
on a personal film.

829
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,548
Personal film?

830
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,087
With no compromise, right?

831
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,679
-Right.
-We'll...

832
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,816
see about you.

833
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,494
I'm old.

834
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:11,021
I can go now and write
my personal work.

835
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:18,431
Nowthat I have something
to write about.

836
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,176
I have to ask...

837
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,052
Did you make love to her?

838
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,826
Did you cut the brakes
on Felix's car?

839
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,003
Remember, Paul...

840
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:52,666
always stand
next to the camera.

841
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:55,369
Your actor
will feel you there...

842
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,811
and will be playing
just for you.

843
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,918
I can't believe it.

844
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,858
Bravo! Did they catch him?

845
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:14,259
Who was the son of a bitch
who stole the film?

846
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,558
Just some old guy.

847
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,725
It doesn't matter anyway.
We got it back.

848
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,132
It's all going to work out.

849
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:23,330
We'll get the final footage
tomorrow on the stage.

850
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,772
-You did good, Paul.
-Where's Valentine? Is she OK?

851
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:30,243
She was fine. In fact,
I think she enjoyed herself.

852
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,644
She just left in a rush.

853
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:35,047
She asked that you call her.

854
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,847
She said it was important.

855
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,821
Antonio, come on, eh?

856
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:48,828
Hi, it's Paul.

857
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,990
You got to come here quickly.

858
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,533
Oh, my God!

859
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:58,835
Taxi!

860
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,893
Come look.

861
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,237
They were just born.

862
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:43,718
I like to document
all the things of my life.

863
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:05,994
I found you.

864
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,697
I was cold.

865
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,208
Thank you very much.

866
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,218
All right.

867
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:35,456
And...

868
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:41,730
And action.

869
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,021
But how?

870
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,523
You're me.

871
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,230
Quickly, we're in danger.

872
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:13,234
Nice try, Dragonfly.

873
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,769
Go, go!

874
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:24,133
My father built
the Dragonfly robot...

875
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,436
for the most dangerous
missions.

876
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,066
He modeled her on me...

877
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,577
her looks and
her lifelike qualities.

878
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,705
But the Corporation
programmed her...

879
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,511
so that
she couldn't betray them.

880
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:38,382
She wanted to help you,
but she couldn't.

881
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,182
That's why I tried to help.

882
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,780
I knewthe revolution
needed this weapon...

883
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,190
so I took it to give to you.

884
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,991
I did it to help you,
to help the cause.

885
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:52,625
I believe in this revolution...

886
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:55,465
and I believe in you.

887
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,806
We were in love.

888
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:04,601
We are identical
in all respects.

889
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:07,714
In all respects?

890
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,876
In all respects.

891
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:53,256
All I really did was stitch
together things from my life.

892
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:55,262
Things that made
an impression on me.

893
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,764
Just put a little piece
of myself out there...

894
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,460
try to organize it,
take a look at it...

895
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:02,526
make some connections,
some sense of things.

896
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:04,469
I think that's
all the time we have.

897
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:05,972
Thanks a lot to Paul.

898
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:15,207
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

899
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,046
I enjoyed what you had to say.

900
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,381
Thank you very much.

901
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,581
By the way,
do you know Felix DeMarco?

902
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:26,118
Do you think you could pass
this script on to him for me?

903
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:29,163
-Sure.
-Thanks.

904
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:36,235
My dog knocked over the tripod,
and the camera kept running...

905
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,363
so I kept it all in the film.

906
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:47,545
...things around you...

907
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,083
as if that would bring
some understanding?

908
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,745
I just want to capture
what's real and honest.

909
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,685
And what if it's boring?

910
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,154
Maybe Marlene was right...

911
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:59,057
but each one of these images
brings up a feeling or a memory.

912
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:03,063
I can smell Marlene when
I see this shot of the soap.

913
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,964
I found her drivers license...

914
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:08,366
and I tried to reach her
by calling her mother...

915
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,233
and Marlene answered.

916
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:17,001
When she heard my voice,
she hung up.

917
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,307
I thought that my film
was going to be about...

918
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:22,941
looking at
all the pieces of myself...

919
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,077
but, Marlene...

920
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,088
I got you in pieces, too.

921
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:35,719
So this is the end...

922
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:38,698
or is it the start?

923
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:40,359
Of what?
