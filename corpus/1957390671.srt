Fine.

Can't ditch the car.
We can't ditch the car.

- Why?

347
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:03,911
Why would they smuggle
so much drug money at once

That's like 500,000 dollars,

353
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,191

00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:19,694

But, I know they're gonna
wanna have it back, so...

Hey.

Unless,
we make a run with it, or...

363
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:36,143
You make a run with it.

364
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:38,112

00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:44,185
just change cars.

That'll take time.

00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:48,856

557
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:29,704
[engine rumbling]

558
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,341
[sighs]

559
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:36,811
Crystal.

560
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:38,378
Crystal.

561
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,414
Who was that guy?

562
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:42,316
Who?

563
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:43,350
Who?

564
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:45,820
The bald guy with the Beretta.

565
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:48,488
You mean Angel.

566
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,693
He, uh...

567
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:54,194
He's a hit man,
work for a mob boss. Jefe.

568
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,764
- [exhales]
- Jefe.

569
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:58,666
I know Jefe.

570
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,703
Who were the other dudes?

571
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:03,838
Just locals.

572
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:08,108
Must know about the money.

573
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,545
You know this guy Cully?

574
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,581
He used to work for, Jefe.

575
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:15,382
He was a...

576
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:17,552
driver.

577
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,287
Driver, like smuggler.

578
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:22,523
Like bodyguard?

579
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,193
Like a guy, with a funny hat.

580
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:30,197
[smooth music]

581
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:04,699
So...

582
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:08,503
He just decided to steal
a car full of money one day.

583
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:12,507
He saw the chance, I guess.

584
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,443
Where do you think he's goin'?

585
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:21,783
His daughter.

586
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:26,420
Somethin' about
his daughter gettin' married.

587
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:30,725
[music fades]

588
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:33,895
What do you mean,
they got the car?

589
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:35,362
He took it.

590
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:36,831
Who?

591
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:38,398
That Cully guy.
He took it and headed south.

592
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:41,903
- Fuck them!
- [clatter]

593
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:50,243
[soft clatter]

594
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:52,747
[speaking Spanish]

595
00:36:58,853 --> 00:36:59,954
There were others.

596
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:03,390
- Who else?
- A crazy dude.

597
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:05,258
Bald.

598
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:06,627
Shot the whole place up.

599
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:08,395
There's a <i>gringo</i>
and a woman, too.

600
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,330
All right.

601
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:12,967
I think I know
where they are going.

602
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:15,903
Luis?

603
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:19,006
Get my cousin on a clean phone.

604
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,274
Go.

605
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,343
Go!

606
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:27,447
[tense music]

607
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:34,454

[door rumbling]

610
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,365

[soft tense music]

624
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:08,643
Hi.

625
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,018
Don't worry.

626
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:18,719
Are you okay?

627
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,789
- Where's Emma?
- She's fine.

628
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:25,126
Um, we don't have her?

629
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:27,128
Now won't you shut up, man?

630
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:28,930
Huh?

631
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,167
I'm sure you know
my cousin Marcos.

632
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,936
- Huh?
- Marcos.

633
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,837
Oh.

634
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:39,073
Yeah, well, he sent us out to
go look for your daughter, but...

635
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:40,942
your wife will do.

636
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:42,076
Why?

637
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,078
Well, you're gonna do
a little job for us, man.

638
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,179
We got a proposition for you.

639
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:46,614
Like what?

640
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:49,482
You're gonna whack Jefe.
You gonna kill him by tomorrow.

641
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:50,217
[chuckles]

642
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,520
Me? [laughs]

643
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,956
You want me to kill
the biggest drug lord in Baja?

644
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,257
Really? [chuckles]

645
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,159
[laughs]

646
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:00,094
- Hilarious, right?
- Yeah, I think so.

647
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,662
[laughs]

648
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,531
Yeah. That's exactly
what you gonna do.

649
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:05,933
And then you gonna deliver
the car with the money in it.

650
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:06,968
Either that...

651
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:09,236
or you never see her again.

652
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:12,273
Oh.

653
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:13,207
Mm. [scoffs]

654
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:15,009
Hey?

655
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:22,616
Are you a sick man?

656
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,951
You telling me that
you would orphan your daughter?

657
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:25,252
Why, hang on, no.

658
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,054
Oh, I mean...
Yeah, I know. I know.

659
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:28,622
No-I mean, of course.

660
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:33,060
Huh? You would
make your daughter motherless,

661
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:34,628
- is that what you're sayin'?
- Maybe.

662
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,530
I mean, have you
spent any time with her?

663
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:39,533
Fuck you, Cully, you prick!
Get me out of here!

664
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:41,569
I'm workin' on it, okay?
But I gotta like you, okay?

665
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:42,770
Help me, okay?
You gotta help me out here.

666
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:44,005
Hey, shut up, man!

667
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:45,506
Where's the car?

668
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,208
What car?

669
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,110
The car with the money in it!

670
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:51,979
Um, I don't believe I know
what you're talking about, sir.

671
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,981
Just give them the car already.

672
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:56,117
I can't give them, I don't
have...

673
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,852
I don't have the car, Maria!
I can't give it to 'em!

674
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:58,953
Liar!

675
00:41:58,986 --> 00:42:00,688
Because you steal everything!

676
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:02,156
Of course he has it!

677
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:04,258
He stole my mother's earrings
and sold them.

678
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,327
One time-You burned my clothes!

679
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,062
You screwed that
cheap waitress at the bar!

680
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,730
She wasn't, she was
a thousand dollars an hour!

681
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:11,766
- And we were separated!
- Shut the hell up!

682
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:14,101
Enough already, man.
I get it, man.

683
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:16,604
The both of you guys
don't like each other, right?

684
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:17,571
Look, man, what...

685
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:20,074
Where's-where's your daughter?

686
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:21,976
- Out.
- Out where?

687
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:24,111
I don't know.
She's out with friends.

688
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:26,714
Wait, wait, wait, back up, man.
You guys mean to tell me

689
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:27,915
you don't even know
where your own daughter's at?

690
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:29,683
- Huh?
- She's a grown woman!

691
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:30,851
She's 18, man!

692
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:33,054
You know what, man?

693
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,622
The both of you guys
are terrible parents.

694
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:35,689
Check yourself.
Terrible parents, my ass!

695
00:42:35,723 --> 00:42:37,024
I gave that girl everything!

696
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:37,958
I mean... I mean,
we gave her everything.

697
00:42:37,992 --> 00:42:39,126
- I mean...
- What?

698
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,194
- I mean, more Maria.
- What?

699
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:41,862
More Maria, gave her everything.

700
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:42,930
Why don't you give me
my damn child support?

701
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:44,298
Oh, god. Child support!

702
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:45,800
I'm so tired of child support!

703
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,168
I'm workin' on it, all right!
I...

704
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:49,070
Oh, you've been
working on it for years!

705
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:50,071
Shut up!

706
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:51,772
All right. Listen, man.

707
00:42:51,806 --> 00:42:53,808
May-maybe this was
a mistake. You know what?

708
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,910
I tell you what.

709
00:42:55,943 --> 00:42:57,111
The boys are gonna
go looking for your daughter.

710
00:42:57,144 --> 00:42:58,879
You're gonna whack Jefe,

711
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:00,247
and then you're gonna
hand over the money in the car.

712
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:01,715
And the girls,
oh, let's just say,

713
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,384
they're gonna walk free,
all right?

714
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:06,120
But before that, Lewis,
dumb shit here,

715
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:08,022
he's gonna take you to the car,

716
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,857
and you know
where the keys are at.

717
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:12,893
Oh. What keys?

718
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:15,863
- [click]
- [gun cocks]

719
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:18,132
I remember something.

720
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:19,767
I'm sorry. You mean the...

721
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,235
You must mean the...
these keys right here.

722
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:25,272
Yeah. All of a sudden
your memory's back, huh?

723
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:27,141
Well, the shotgun helped me out.
It jogged my memory.

724
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:28,943
Yeah, it does that sometimes.
Man, shut him the hell up!

725
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:30,111
Sorry.

726
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:31,178
- Shut him up!
- I'm sorry.

727
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:33,280
[car ambiance]

728
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,749
You work for Jefe, too?

729
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:38,853
No.

730
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:41,355
Just a freelance contract.

731
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:42,957
Retrieval.

732
00:43:44,024 --> 00:43:45,126
The guy Cully?

733
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,362
More his car, it seems.

734
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:49,296
But yeah.

735
00:43:57,338 --> 00:43:58,239
Look.

736
00:43:59,039 --> 00:43:59,940
I can help you.

737
