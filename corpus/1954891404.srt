1
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:52,459
For centuries in
the jungle of Parané...

2
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:59,792
...the inhabitants performed rituals to
invoke beings from the river's current...

3
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:05,126
...who could help them
in case of an invasion.

4
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:11,167
Today, those who work this same
land as a means of subsistence...

5
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:16,792
...still resort to those rituals
when a threat is near.

6
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:12,417
THE BURNING

7
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:31,917
India?

8
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,251
Gathering water.

9
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:59,251
Go get her.

10
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:17,667
She killed herself.

11
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,876
She hanged herself a while ago.

12
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:35,584
The branch held her weight.

13
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,459
The tiger jumped at her.

14
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,667
And then the branch broke.

15
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,917
There's no need to bury her.

16
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:14,251
C'mon, let's go.

17
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,542
Alone?

18
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:16,417
Just me.

19
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,917
Good.

20
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:27,417
Come with me.

21
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,834
Morning.

22
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:11,292
Joao, the farm's owner.

23
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:26,917
Joao, at your service.

24
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:36,209
Did you see them?

25
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:43,251
They will come.

26
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:51,459
Yes, we know.

27
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,417
Good.

28
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,876
Morning, my child.

29
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,542
Morning.

30
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:53,709
Yesterday, the hills were
burning until nightfall.

31
00:14:56,917 --> 00:15:00,792
If you came by the river
perhaps you saw it.

32
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:09,001
Last week, they did
the same over there.

33
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:15,292
Three days earlier,
they got very close.

34
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:19,334
Very close. Less than
a kilometre away.

35
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,459
From this spot,
we could see the flames.

36
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,251
It wasn't like this before.

37
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:34,792
We knew, every once in a while,
that there was a hidden fire...

38
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,417
...because of the smell
or the smoke. But...

39
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:43,209
This is different.

40
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:49,376
They want it all.

41
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,626
But not for themselves.

42
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,292
They've always been nomads.

43
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:07,084
These neighbours that had
the farm past the creek...

44
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:11,501
...tried to confront them. They
were kicked out with shotguns.

45
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:16,167
They burned their property.
They had to leave.

46
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:21,292
They had to leave.

47
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:04,834
I made it today.

48
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,376
You are lucky, we don't
always have some.

49
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,834
I brought you this.

50
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:02,542
We've seen it before.

51
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:05,251
They burn it all.

52
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,542
They bring pines and soy...

53
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:10,709
And all of this is wiped out.

54
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:15,376
Besides, they want to set up
a processing plant here.

55
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,584
They came to talk to me.

56
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:27,834
It's perfect for them because
it's near the river. But no.

57
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:35,584
I came here with
my father in 1970.

58
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:39,542
We busted our asses working!

59
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:48,126
We managed to buy
this after ten harvests.

60
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,834
I met my wife here.

61
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:59,584
I raised my daughter here.

62
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,542
You belong here.

63
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:41,376
May I help you?

64
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:46,251
Yuca needs to be peeled.

65
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,334
I'm sure he'll help us.

66
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:24,584
Nobody's going to
kick us out of here.

67
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:37,917
What happened?

68
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:38,792
Down!

69
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,417
Jara?

70
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,417
Jara!

71
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,417
Come!

72
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,042
No, please!

73
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,126
Easy...

74
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,001
Be quiet.

75
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,251
The deserter.

76
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,417
Look where he was.

77
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:53,542
We'll leave.
We will. But please...

78
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:57,042
Please...

79
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:59,459
I don't want you to leave, sir.

80
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:02,459
I want you to sign.

81
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:14,959
What's this?

82
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,417
It's a bill of sale.

83
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:22,792
You sign it, you live.

84
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,459
You don't sign it...

85
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,167
Dad.

86
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,167
Look inside.

87
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,751
Take it easy...
Walk.

88
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:48,292
There's always a woman.

89
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:54,542
Vando, take her.

90
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,542
I'll sign.

91
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,751
Don't sign, Dad.

92
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,084
Don't sign!

93
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:19,334
Either you sign...
or I out off her head.

94
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:13,334
One or two, it's the same.

95
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:12,292
Sit.

96
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,792
Drink.

97
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,209
She won't cook today.

98
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:44,417
Tomorrow she will.

99
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:51,001
Vando... She's yours.

100
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:06,876
Drink.

101
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:29,667
No!

102
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:37,876
First, you kill a raccoon...

103
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:39,876
A fox...

104
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,792
Then a boar...

105
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:47,126
Then a man...

106
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:53,042
You leave the tiger for last.

107
00:38:57,334 --> 00:39:00,251
You have many things left to kill.

108
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,334
Come here...

109
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,376
No, no!

110
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:29,667
I buried your dad
next to the house.

111
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,126
And Jara?

112
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:43,501
He'll be fine.

113
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:46,876
With time.

114
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:48,251
He's alive?

115
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:51,334
Yes.

116
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,001
We need to move on.

117
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:23,792
Last night I saw
the jaguar. The tiger.

118
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:28,709
He almost ate me.

119
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:36,209
I had never seen him so close.

120
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:39,251
He's beautiful.

121
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:47,209
He's got nowhere to go.

122
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:51,626
That's why he roams around here.

123
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:54,959
These people will kill him.

124
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,376
We shouldn't be here.

125
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:14,834
Why did you hide when they came?

126
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:19,001
You didn't help.

127
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:30,209
They were going to kill us all.

128
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:38,167
I've seen the older two before.

129
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:42,917
You know them?

130
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,334
Yes.

131
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:48,334
It's not just these three.
There are more.

132
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:54,292
When they come back,
they'll be more.

133
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:58,584
Our little brother is a grown man.

134
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:12,834
A while ago I saw my father do
the same thing you did.

135
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:19,167
When I asked him about it he said...

136
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:22,251
"I'm asking for help".

137
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:30,042
Two days later, you arrived.

138
00:52:36,459 --> 00:52:39,209
I also lost my house.

139
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:45,792
When they burned
our farm, upstream.

140
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:50,292
But that was a while ago.

141
00:52:57,292 --> 00:53:00,917
Everyone in my family disappeared.

142
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:07,792
Nobody could live elsewhere.

143
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:14,459
Even I tried to live in town
but I couldn't.

144
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:18,209
When I saw what we became there.

145
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:24,542
So I returned to the jungle.

146
00:53:27,126 --> 00:53:30,792
Those who live here taught me
how to belong to this place.

147
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:41,667
I've had the feeling I had to swim
down the river for a long time.

148
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:48,917
When I arrived at your farm I realised
why the current brought me here.

149
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:56,001
It was you.

150
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:05,626
But none of that matters now.

151
00:54:08,334 --> 00:54:10,459
Why not?

152
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,876
The current has changed.

153
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:38,917
Come! Here!

154
00:58:39,334 --> 00:58:41,417
C'mon, c'mon!

155
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:28,501
Quiet!

156
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:48,209
Tulio, let's go!
The rest of you stay!

157
01:06:55,917 --> 01:06:57,792
It's alright.

158
01:06:59,626 --> 01:07:01,084
Hold on.

159
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:03,167
Do I do it?

160
01:07:12,084 --> 01:07:13,417
It's ok.

161
01:11:00,209 --> 01:11:03,001
Ready, my friend.

162
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:07,376
Now rest for a while.

163
01:11:13,001 --> 01:11:14,501
I remember you.

164
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:39,626
I guess it's not
from the sawmill.

165
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:43,584
I haven't seen you there.

166
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:47,251
You were with them.

167
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:09,959
Awhile ago...

168
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:14,292
...they sent me to
check out this place.

169
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:23,542
They wanted to see whether
this was an easy job or not.

170
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:29,709
To determine how
to handle Mr. Joao.

171
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:37,126
They had already spoken
to Mr. Joao but he...

172
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:44,001
...he didn't want to sell.

173
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:55,917
They've been wanting this
land for a long time now.

174
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:23,167
But when I got here...

175
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,876
I saw this place...

176
01:13:31,626 --> 01:13:33,792
I saw her.

177
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:40,751
I realised that all of this
shouldn't disappear.

178
01:13:44,126 --> 01:13:47,292
That I wanted
to stay and help.

179
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:05,084
We must get ready.

180
01:14:05,917 --> 01:14:08,292
They are approaching slowly now.

181
01:14:09,417 --> 01:14:11,709
But they'll be here soon.

182
01:14:12,501 --> 01:14:14,209
How many?

183
01:14:14,292 --> 01:14:16,501
Eight.

184
01:14:17,334 --> 01:14:20,167
All armed.

185
01:14:21,709 --> 01:14:23,501
Well...

186
01:14:26,251 --> 01:14:27,876
There are three of us.

187
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:32,376
Two wounded.

188
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:38,334
And the uninjured one is a woman
who's never shot a gun before.

189
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:44,501
But you were with them.

190
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:48,792
That should help.

191
01:14:51,126 --> 01:14:53,501
I suppose.

192
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:04,001
They are hunters.

193
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:08,542
That's the main thing we
should keep in mind.

194
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:14,417
They won't come in together.

195
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:19,584
Two of them will come
from that side...

196
01:15:21,626 --> 01:15:24,251
Three others from that one.

197
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:29,084
And the rest will spread
out near the river.

198
01:15:31,876 --> 01:15:34,459
They'll probably
come two at a time.

199
01:15:35,417 --> 01:15:38,042
Especially if they
believe there's danger.

200
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:43,709
They'll try to shoot us
from a distance at first.

201
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:49,126
Then come and set fires next.

202
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:53,209
We should be careful of bombs.

203
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:56,876
I think our best bet...

204
01:15:57,001 --> 01:16:00,417
...is to try to confuse them.

205
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:03,126
Obscure their vision.

206
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:09,209
So they can't signal each other.

207
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:12,876
So they have to make noise, talk.

208
01:16:15,126 --> 01:16:18,292
While we try to hide.

209
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,709
To hide is not enough.

210
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:27,001
We must defend ourselves.

211
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:31,001
I have an idea for that.

212
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:34,251
Come with me.

213
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:39,126
To defend ourselves is not enough.

214
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:16,459
Vania is right.

215
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:22,251
You know that, don't you?

216
01:19:03,626 --> 01:19:06,292
Tulio, go with Hacha and Domenico...

217
01:19:06,917 --> 01:19:09,501
To the main house.

218
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,667
If you see them, shoot.

219
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,376
If you don't, set fire.

220
01:19:22,417 --> 01:19:24,709
You, to the right.

221
01:19:27,334 --> 01:19:30,209
Prepare the bombs
before you enter.

222
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:38,667
Let's go.

223
01:22:22,334 --> 01:22:24,584
I can't see them! I can't!

224
01:22:24,626 --> 01:22:27,251
Relax.

225
01:22:35,667 --> 01:22:38,459
My brother and I have
unfinished business here.

226
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:40,959
You're done.

227
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:44,334
Go.

228
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:50,459
Can you do it?

229
01:22:50,959 --> 01:22:54,251
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

230
01:24:20,334 --> 01:24:21,417
Over there!

231
01:32:28,917 --> 01:32:30,876
Are you gonna be okay?

232
01:32:33,376 --> 01:32:35,376
Yeah, I'll be okay.

233
01:32:37,126 --> 01:32:38,834
YOU?

234
01:32:47,042 --> 01:32:49,459
We'll be fine.

235
01:32:53,209 --> 01:32:55,584
It would be good
if you stayed around.

236
01:32:58,959 --> 01:33:02,417
The people who sent
them will send more.

237
01:33:06,751 --> 01:33:09,167
I'll be around.
