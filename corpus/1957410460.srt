2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,215
- I GOT SOME WORLD WAR Il
STUFF HERE FROM MY DAD.

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,208
THIS IS THE JACKET THAT
HE WORE. HE FLEW P-38s.

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,869
- SOME OF THESE CAN BE
WORTH A LOT OF MONEY.

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:13,778
- GOT THE FIRST THREE
SEASONS OF <i>SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.</i>

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,047
- BACK IN THE '50s, THIS IS
HOW YOU KEPT UP WITH SPORTS.

7
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,210
- GOT THE FIRST-EVER
SWIMSUIT EDITION.

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,550
- WAH, WAH, WHEE-WAH.

9
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,089
- I HAVE AN OLD MUSKET HERE.

10
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,748
- SHOULDN'T THAT BE
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER?

11
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,258
- YEAH, IT IS A
REALLY SMALL RIFLE.

12
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,759
DID YOU CHECK TO
SEE IF IT'S LOADED?

13
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:27,851
- NO.

14
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,022
- AH!
- OH, MY GOD.

15
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,261
I'M RICK HARRISON, AND
THIS IS MY PAWN SHOP.

16
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:38,897
I WORK HERE WITH MY OLD
MAN AND MY SON, BIG HOSS.

17
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,101
EVERYTHING IN HERE
HAS A STORY AND A PRICE.

18
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,804
ONE THING I'VE
LEARNED AFTER 21 YEARS,

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,177
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS
GONNA COME THROUGH THAT DOOR.

21
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,991
- OH, IT'S YOU AGAIN.

22
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,622
TRYING TO SELL ME
SOMETHING ELSE, HUH?

23
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,257
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

24
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,011
- I GOT SOME WORLD WAR Il
STUFF HERE FROM MY DAD.

25
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,594
THIS IS A SURVIVAL KIT.

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,401
- FIRST AID KITS IN THE
SECOND WORLD WAR,

27
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,738
THEY HAD GUM:, THEY
HAD CANDY BARS:,

28
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,835
THEY HAD SPEED, MORPHINE.

29
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,073
- SO I GUESS IF YOU WERE SHOT
DOWN AND HURT REALLY BAD,

30
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,912
YOU COULD TAKE SOME MORPHINE
AND HAVE SOME FRESH BREATH.

31
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,509
[laughs]

32
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,852
- I DECIDED TO COME TO
THE PAWN SHOP TODAY

33
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,948
TO SELL MY DAD'S WORLD
WAR Il PILOT JACKET,

34
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,686
A FIRST AID KIT, AND A HAT.

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,737
WE FOUND IT IN HIS CLOSET.
IT'S BEEN THERE FOR YEARS.

36
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,354
MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO
REALLY APPRECIATES IT

37
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,262
CAN BUY IT AND
DISPLAY IT SOMEWHERE.

38
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,632
I'M HOPING TO SELL THESE
ITEMS FOR ABOUT $2,000 OR $3,000.

39
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,672
I MIGHT GO AS LOW
AS ABOUT $1,500.

40
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,172
MY DAD WAS STATIONED IN ITALY.

41
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,730
HE FLEW MISSIONS,

42
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,744
PRIMARILY BOMBING TRAINS
AND POWER STATIONS.

43
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,110
THIS IS THE JACKET THAT
HE WORE WHILE HE FLEW.

44
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,844
IT'S GOT THE AIRPLANE HE
FLEW, THE P-38, RIGHT HERE.

45
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,442
- OKAY.

46
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,496
THE P-38 LIGHTNING WAS A
WORLD WAR Il FIGHTER PLANE

47
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,046
THAT WAS REALLY UNIQUE
BECAUSE IT HAD TWIN ENGINES.

48
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,115
IT WAS SO COOL-LOOKING

49
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,822
THAT THE 1948 CADILLAC HAD
ITS TAIL FINS MODELED AFTER IT.

50
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,194
I MEAN, THERE WAS
BASICALLY TWO WARS GOING ON.

51
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,200
THERE WAS THE PACIFIC CAMPAIGN
AGAINST THE JAPANESE AND EUROPE.

52
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,667
ITALY WAS BAD.

53
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,137
I MEAN, WHEN WE FIRST
WENT TO INVADE ITALY,

54
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,231
THE GERMANS WERE DUG
IN:, THEY HAD GOOD WEAPONS.

55
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,503
YOU KNOW, THEY COULD DIAL
THE GUNS IN AT 10,000 FEET.

56
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,340
AND ALL THEY HAD
TO DO IS BLOW UP

57
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,422
A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM
YOU:, IT WOULD TAKE A PLANE DOWN.

58
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,142
REMEMBER, THESE
THINGS WERE, LIKE,

59
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,013
MICRO-THIN ALUMINUM
ALL AROUND THEM.

60
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,683
- AND HE WAS LUCKY
ENOUGH NOT TO GET HIT.

61
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,016
NEITHER DID ANY OF HIS FRIENDS.

62
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,349
HE WAS JUST A KID.

63
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,219
HE EVEN SAID IF
HE WAS ANY OLDER,

64
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,434
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
TOO SMART TO BE FLYING OVER THERE,

65
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,756
'CAUSE HE WAS 19
OR 20 YEARS OLD.

66
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,488
THEY THOUGHT THEY
WERE INVINCIBLE,

67
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,258
AND HE ACTUALLY HAD A
GOOD TIME OVER THERE.

68
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,197
- THE JACKET
INTRIGUES ME, THOUGH.

69
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,996
SOME OF THESE CAN BE
WORTH A LOT OF MONEY.

70
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,230
DO YOU KNOW HOW
MANY RUNS HE MADE?

71
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,637
- I REALLY DON'T, BUT HE WAS
THERE, I THINK, TWO YEARS.

72
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,518
- THE HAT, I DON'T THINK
IS WORTH A LOT OF MONEY,

73
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,840
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

74
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,435
A LITTLE MOTH-EATEN TOO.

75
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,777
AND...

76
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,179
- WE COULD OPEN
THAT IF YOU WANT.

77
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,911
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO OPEN IT.

78
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,104
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THIS
STUFF IS REALLY GOOD ANYMORE

79
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,849
BESIDES MAYBE THE MATCHES.

80
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,719
THE ONLY QUESTIONS I HAVE IS,

81
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,259
I KNOW THIS INSIGNIA RIGHT
HERE IS FROM ITALY, OKAY?

82
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,918
- OKAY.

83
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,054
- THE THING THAT REALLY
WEIRDS ME OUT HERE, THOUGH:

84
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,394
I'M PRETTY SURE
THE P-38 LIGHTNING

85
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,127
WAS PACIFIC THEATER ONLY.

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,532
- NO, I KNOW HE WAS IN ITALY,

87
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,194
'CAUSE HE HAD
RELATIVES OVER THERE.

88
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,898
HE WENT AND SAW THEM.

89
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,963
- I JUST WANT SOMEONE
TO CHECK THIS OUT,

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,373
MAKE SURE IT'S
ACTUALLY NOT SOMETHING

91
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,571
THAT THE GROUND FORCES
WORE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT:,

92
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,273
IT'S AN ACTUAL FLIGHT JACKET.

93
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,957
I WANT TO FIND OUT
ABOUT THE FIRST AID KIT,

94
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,540
'CAUSE I'VE NEVER HAD ONE.

95
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,948
THE HAT, WE MIGHT AS WELL

96
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,646
HAVE HIM CHECK IT
OUT WHILE HE'S HERE.

97
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,245
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

98
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,313
IF THESE ITEMS WERE
USED BY A FIGHTER PILOT

99
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,655
DURING WORLD WAR Il, THERE'S
NO QUESTION I WANT THEM.

100
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,457
BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
A P-38 BEING USED IN ITALY,

101
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,019
AND THAT CONCERNS ME,

102
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,328
SO I HAVE TO HAVE
THEM CHECKED OUT.

103
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,798
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

104
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,504
- GOT SOME CIVIL DEFENSE ALL
PURPOSE SURVIVAL CRACKERS.

105
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,604
- WHAT DO THEY DEFEND?

106
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,978
- HUNGER.

107
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,812
- SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

108
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,479
- I CAME DOWN TO THE PAWN
SHOP TODAY TO SELL MY CRACKERS.

109
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,317
THESE ARE ABOUT 48 YEARS OLD

110
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,619
BUT IN, YOU KNOW,
PRETTY GOOD CONDITION.

111
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,160
I'M HOPING TO SELL THESE
FOR AT LEAST $75 TODAY,

112
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,526
BUT I'M WILLING TO TAKE $40.

113
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,155
- SO WHERE DID YOU GET THESE?

114
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,530
- A BUDDY OF MINE WORKS
FOR A REAL ESTATE COMPANY,

115
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,626
AND THEY WERE ABOUT
TO REMODEL A BUILDING.

116
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,637
TOOK ME DOWN INTO THE
OLD FALLOUT SHELTER,

117
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:34,038
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL OF THESE
CRACKER CONTAINERS DOWN THERE.

118
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,201
- I LOVE SOME OF
THE INGREDIENTS.

119
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,177
"PROPYL GALLATE"

120
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:42,512
AND "PROPYLENE GLYCOL
ADDED TO PRESERVE FRESHNESS."

121
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,948
- SOUNDS GOOD.

122
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,645
- CHUM, YOU CAN'T EAT THESE.

123
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,781
I GUARANTEE YOU, AFTER 48
YEARS, THEY'RE PROBABLY BAD.

124
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,418
THE NATIONAL BISCUIT
COMPANY. YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?

125
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,394
- NOW THEY'RE KNOWN AS NABISCO.

126
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,055
THAT WAS THE NAME
BEFORE "NABISCO."

127
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,190
- DURING THE COLD WAR,
MANY BUILDINGS' BASEMENTS

128
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,462
WERE DESIGNATED
AS FALLOUT SHELTERS.

129
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,027
THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD GO
IN CASE OF A NUCLEAR ATTACK.

130
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,663
NABISCO WAS ONE OF THE COMPANIES

131
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,731
THAT STOCKED THESE
FALLOUT SHELTERS WITH FOOD.

132
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,710
WELL, IN THE EARLY '60s,
A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT

133
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,575
THAT NUCLEAR WAR WAS INEVITABLE

134
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,138
AND THAT WE REALLY NEEDED
THESE FALLOUT SHELTERS.

135
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,547
THEY MORE OR LESS
STOPPED DOING IT

136
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,983
BECAUSE THEY
REALIZED IT WAS... STUPID.

137
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,418
[laughter]

138
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,251
I MEAN, IF A NUCLEAR
BOMB IS DROPPED,

139
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,655
FALLOUT SHELTERS
AREN'T GONNA DO A LOT.

140
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,522
- I'M FIGURING IT'S A
GOOD THING FOR SOMEONE

141
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,222
THAT'S INTO COLD WAR, YOU
KNOW, COLLECTIBLES AND...

142
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,356
- I MEAN, IT'S NOT, LIKE,
REALLY COLLECTIBLE,

143
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,161
BUT IT IS SORT OF
LIKE A NOVELTY.

144
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,861
THESE CRACKERS ARE A REMINDER

145
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,904
OF ALL THE CRAZINESS GOING
ON DURING THE COLD WAR.

146
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,235
I'M SURE I CAN FIND
A BUYER FOR THEM.

147
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,774
I'M JUST REALLY GLAD

148
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,072
NO ONE HAD TO ACTUALLY
EVER OPEN THESE THINGS.

149
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,873
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO WITH THIS?

150
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,956
- I WAS HOPING TO SELL IT.
- WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?

151
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,812
- THEY WERE GOING
AS HIGH AS $99 ONLINE.

152
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,350
I WAS HOPING TO GET AROUND $75.

153
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,785
- REALLY?
- $75 FOR SOME OLD CRACKERS?

154
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,789
CAN'T YOU DO MORE LIKE $35, MAN?

155
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,451
- THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THEM
I'VE SEEN THAT ARE NABISCO,

156
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,118
AND IT'S IN GREAT SHAPE.

157
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,425
HOW ABOUT $50?

158
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,125
- I CAN DO $40,
MAYBE, AT THE MOST.

159
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,896
- $45.

160
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:13,202
- YOU'RE REALLY
BEATING ME UP, MAN.

161
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:16,402
I'LL MEET YOU IN
THE MIDDLE AT $42.

162
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,138
- [laughs] OKAY.

163
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,645
- IT'S A DEAL.
- I'LL DO IT.

164
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,739
- RICK, GO DO THE PAPERWORK.

165
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,148
- YEAH, WHATEVER. GO
DO THE PAPERWORK, CHUM.

166
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,947
- I ENDED UP GETTING $42 FOR IT.

167
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,197
I WAS HOPING TO GET MORE, BUT
THE GUY THAT WAS NEGOTIATING

168
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,656
WAS DRIVING A
PRETTY HARD BARGAIN.

169
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,230
- HEY, WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?

170
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,097
- WELL, I HAVE AN
OLD MUSKET HERE.

171
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,965
I'D LIKE TO GET RID OF IT.

172
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,801
- I'M NO EXPERT, BUT SHOULDN'T
THAT BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER?

173
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,966
- OKAY, YEAH, 'CAUSE
IT DOESN'T REALLY...

174
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,168
IT FITS, LIKE, A KID.

175
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,471
[laughs]

176
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,875
USUALLY THESE
ARE, LIKE, THIS BIG.

177
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,538
- YEAH, I REALIZE THAT, BUT...

178
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,424
- IT HAS A BAYONET. I'M
ASSUMING IT'S MILITARY.

179
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,417
- MAYBE IT WAS FOR
SMALL SOLDIERS.

180
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,476
PEOPLE WERE A LITTLE
SHORTER BACK THEN.

181
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,111
[laughter]

182
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,822
- I'M COMING TO THE
PAWN SHOP TODAY.

183
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,485
I'M TRYING TO SELL
AN OLD MUSKET,

184
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,084
COULD USE EXTRA CASH FOR
SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO BUY.

185
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,153
I'M HOPING TO GET $1,500.

186
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,631
I MIGHT TAKE $1,000.

187
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,143
- WHERE IN THE WORLD
DID YOU GET THIS?

188
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,692
- OH, I PICKED IT UP
AT AN ESTATE SALE.

189
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,601
- OKAY.

190
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,334
IT'S A LOT SMALLER THAN A NORMAL
MILITARY FLINTLOCK OF THE DAY.

191
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,273
I MEAN, IT LOOKS LATE 1700s.

192
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,777
I KNOW THERE WAS KIDS
IN THE MILITARY BACK THEN

193
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,472
THAT WERE, LIKE,
13, 14 YEARS OLD.

194
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,174
MAYBE THEY ISSUED
THEM DIFFERENT GUNS.

195
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,012
I MEAN, EVERYTHING
DOWN TO THE BAYONET

196
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,608
IS SMALLER THAN NORMAL.

197
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:39,354
A BAYONET FOR THIS
PERIOD WOULD BE, LIKE...

198
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,292
THAT BIG.
- OH, MY.

199
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,627
- A TYPICAL 18TH-CENTURY MUSKET
IS RIGHT AROUND 60 INCHES LONG.

200
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,133
THIS THING IS MAYBE A LITTLE
BIGGER THAN HALF THAT SIZE.

201
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,691
IT'S REALLY ODD.

202
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,703
IT'S NOT A HUNTING
RIFLE MADE FOR A KID.

203
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,261
IT'S A MILITARY WEAPON.

204
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,365
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

205
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,807
SO WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO DO WITH IT?

206
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,571
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO
PART WITH IT, SELL IT.

207
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,455
- OKAY. HOW MUCH WERE
YOU LOOKING TO GET OUT OF IT?

208
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,641
- OH, I'M THINKING
SOMEWHERE AROUND 15.

209
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,308
- HUNDRED?
- YES.

210
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,217
- OKAY, THAT MIGHT NOT
BE OUT OF THE QUESTION.

211
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,312
I MEAN, EVERYTHING LOOKS
GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE SIZE,

212
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,754
WHICH HAS ME REALLY CONCERNED

213
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,267
WHY SOMEONE WOULD
MAKE A GUN LIKE THIS.

214
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,931
I DON'T WANT THIS THING
BEING A MOVIE PROP

215
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,325
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

216
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,805
AND ME SPENDING A
LOT OF MONEY ON IT.

217
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,024
- SURE, I UNDERSTAND.

218
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,531
- I MEAN, I DON'T THINK IT IS,

219
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,276
BUT THEN AGAIN, I'VE BEEN
WRONG A LOT OF TIMES.

220
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,877
DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE
SOMEONE LOOK AT IT?

221
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,494
- NO, THAT'D BE FINE.

222
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,147
- LET ME MAKE A PHONE
CALL, I'LL GET HIM DOWN HERE,

223
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,611
AND WE'LL GET THIS
THING CHECKED OUT.

224
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,902
ALL RIGHT?
- SOUNDS GOOD.

225
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,408
- IT'S POSSIBLE
THIS COULD BE, LIKE,

226
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,910
A SCALED-DOWN REPRODUCTION.

227
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,577
OR IT COULD BE A
CHILD'S MILITARY MUSKET,

228
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,079
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT REALLY RARE.

229
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,706
I'VE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE,

230
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:43,782
SO THIS IS SOMETHING
I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN.

231
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,085
- EARLIER, I HAD A GUY COME IN

232
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,338
TRYING TO SELL SOME OLD
AVIATOR STUFF FROM WORLD WAR Il.

233
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,058
I HAVE SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM,

234
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,175
SO I INVITED MY BUDDY PAUL
DOWN TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

235
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,724
HEY, PAUL. HOW'S IT GOING?

236
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,793
- HEY, RICK. HOW YOU BEEN?
- I'M DOING GREAT.

237
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,237
- I'M PAUL MILBURY OF MILITARY
HISTORICAL ARMS AND ANTIQUES.

238
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,036
I'M AN EXPERT IN ALL
TYPES OF MILITARY STUFF

239
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,738
DATING FROM WORLD
WAR Il BACK TO ABOUT 1776.

240
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,976
RICK, WHAT'S YOUR CONCERNS
OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JACKET?

241
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,642
- WHAT'S IT WORTH?

242
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,652
MY OTHER CONCERN
WAS THE P-38 ON THE BACK.

243
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,415
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
PACIFIC THEATER ONLY.

244
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,319
I COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG.

245
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,257
- THE P-38 LIGHTNING WAS USED
BY THE 97TH FIGHTER SQUADRON

246
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,487
FROM 1942 TO '45.

247
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,497
THE LATIN NAME WAS
<i>GERENVETSO SATANA.</i>

248
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,590
WHICH IS LATIN FOR "DEVIL CAT."

249
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,396
- SO THIS WAS FROM
THE DEVIL CATS.

250
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,868
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

251
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,532
- THE PAINTING ON THE
BACK IS FAIRLY WEAK.

252
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,040
ONE OF THE SAD THINGS IS,

253
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,509
IT'S BEEN ON A HANGER TOO LONG,

254
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,603
AND YOU SEE THAT WHERE
IT'S BROKEN THROUGH.

255
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,910
- NOW, WHAT ABOUT
THE SURVIVAL KIT?

256
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,748
- YOU DON'T SEE THESE TOO OFTEN
ANYMORE WITH THE CONTENTS.

257
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,515
- SO WHAT'S SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WORTH?

258
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,681
- THIS ISN'T IN THE
BEST OF SHAPE, SO...

259
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,657
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- MAYBE 75 BUCKS.

260
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,420
- OKAY, AND IS THE
HAT WORTH ANYTHING?

261
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:56,520
- THE HAT IS NOT IN
TOO GREAT OF SHAPE.

262
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,030
YOU HAVE A LOT OF MOTHING HERE.

263
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,363
IN THIS CONDITION,
YOU'D BE LUCKY

264
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,096
TO GET $35, $45 OUT OF IT.

265
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,297
NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY
OTHER ITEMS THAT GO WITH IT?

266
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,533
'CAUSE ACTUALLY, WHAT'S
GOING TO MAKE THIS VALUABLE

267
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,132
IS THE PAPERWORK AND THE HISTORY

268
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,041
SAYING WHAT HE
DID, WHERE HE DID IT.

269
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,171
THAT'S WHAT BRINGS
IN THE VALUE NOW.

270
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:17,047
THE JACKET, I'D SAY, PUT
BETWEEN $1,000 AND $1,500.

271
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,677
WITH HISTORY BEHIND
IT, WITH THE PAPERWORK,

272
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,345
WITH OTHER STUFF, I MEAN,

273
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:26,291
THE JACKET COULD BRING,
YOU KNOW, $1,500 TO $2,500.

274
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,988
- OKAY. THANKS A
LOT. I APPRECIATE IT.

275
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,394
- FLIGHT JACKETS
ARE REALLY GREAT.

276
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,193
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
SEE THEM TOO OFTEN.

277
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,393
THEY'RE DISAPPEARING FROM
THE COLLECTOR'S MARKET.

278
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,459
- SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO WITH THESE?

279
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,402
- PROBABLY SELL IT.
- OKAY.

280
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,373
HOW MUCH DID YOU WANT FOR THEM?
- I WAS THINKING AROUND $1,500.

281
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,376
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- NO.

282
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,912
- I'M THINKING, LIKE,
$750 FOR ALL OF IT.

283
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,948
- WE'RE NOT COLLECTORS.
WE'RE SELLERS.

284
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,312
- RIGHT.

285
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,944
- AND WHEN WE
PAY YOU $100 BILLS,

286
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,887
THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE
AND HOLD IT, MARKET IT,

287
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,585
AND THEN WE TRY TO
ACQUIRE MORE $100 BILLS,

288
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,992
BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T.

289
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,757
- LISTENING TO
PAUL, I'M THINKING...

290
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,992
I GOT PAPERWORK AT
HOME THAT GOES WITH THIS.

291
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,500
MAYBE I'LL HOLD ON TO IT,
PUT THE PACKAGE TOGETHER,

292
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:09,866
AND BRING IT BACK IN HERE.

293
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,495
- YEAH, BECAUSE IF
YOU BRING THAT IN,

294
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,699
I COULD PROBABLY MAKE
MORE MONEY WHEN I SELL IT.

295
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,366
- WE CAN ALL DO.

296
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,119
- WE CAN ALL MAKE MORE
MONEY. IT WOULD BE NICE.

297
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,509
- THEY WANTED TO OFFER $750.

298
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,410
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD PRICE,

299
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,791
BUT I'M HOPING TO PUT TOGETHER
MORE OF A COMPLETE COLLECTION,

300
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,944
BRING IT BACK HERE,
MAYBE GET $5,000 OR $10,000.

301
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,178
- EARLIER, A GUY
BROUGHT IN A MUSKET

302
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,121
THAT'S A REALLY ODD SIZE.

303
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,127
IT MIGHT BE FOR A KID,
BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW,

304
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,720
SO I CALLED MY BUDDY SEAN
DOWN TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

305
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,697
HEY, SEAN. WHAT'S UP?
- CHUM.

306
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,028
MY NAME IS SEAN RICH,

307
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,761
AND I OWN TORTUGA TRADING INC.,

308
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,803
AND I SPECIALIZE IN
ANTIQUE ARMS AND ARMOR.

309
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,772
ALL RIGHT, RICK, SO I'M SURE
YOU'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS.

310
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,432
FIRE AWAY.

311
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,340
- WHAT IS IT?
THAT'S BASICALLY IT.

312
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,936
IT SEEMS LIKE A 3/4 SIZE GUN.

313
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,779
- THIS IS ACTUALLY A HALF
SCALE OF A FULL-SIZE MUSKET.

314
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,045
THESE WERE MADE
JUST THE SAME WAY

315
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,247
AS THE FULL-SIZE
MUSKETS BUT FOR A YOUTH.

316
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,292
SO A WEALTHY OFFICER
WHO HAD A CHILD...

317
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,384
SAY, 13 YEARS OLD...
HE WOULD TEACH HIM

318
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,921
THE PROPER WAYS TO HANDLE
A MUSKET, JUST LIKE DAD,

319
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,660
WITH THE BAYONET AND EVERYTHING.

320
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,293
THE OTHER GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS IS THE MAKER.

321
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,133
"H. NOCK" IS HENRY NOCK.

322
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:22,073
NOCK WAS ONE OF THE BEST AND
MOST WELL-KNOWN GUNMAKERS

323
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,509
IN ENGLAND DURING THE LAST
QUARTER OF THE 18TH CENTURY.

324
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,673
SO THIS DATES
BETWEEN 1770 AND 1780.

325
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,582
THIS IS JUST NOT RARE.
IT'S EXTREMELY RARE.

326
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,415
- THAT'S CRAZY.

327
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,318
ALL I GOT WHEN I WAS
A KID WAS A BB GUN.

328
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,153
- THIS IS A VERY
UNIQUE PIECE TO FIND.

329
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,487
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THESE.

330
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,027
NOT ONLY IS THIS SPECIAL

331
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,290
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE
AND THE QUALITY OF IT,

332
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,855
BUT THE FACT THAT THIS
IS MADE BY HENRY NOCK

333
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,594
JUST PUTS IT OVER THE TOP.

334
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,226
- SO WHAT'S THIS THING WORTH?

335
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,827
- [sighs] THAT'S A
VERY GOOD QUESTION.

336
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,496
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING
SINCE I WAS TEN,

337
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,871
AND I'VE ONLY SEEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN A BOOK.

338
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,911
SO I HAVE TO KIND OF
GO ON THE GUT BY THIS.

339
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,708
I THINK THIS IS SO RARE
THAT IN AN AUCTION SETTING,

340
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,442
PEOPLE WOULD FIGHT OVER IT.

341
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,677
I WOULD EXPECT
THE BID RANGE TO BE

342
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,447
IN THAT $5,000 TO $10,000 RANGE.

343
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,114
- [laughs] JACKPOT!

344
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,656
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S NO GUARANTEE,

345
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,487
BUT IT'S JUST... THAT'S
WHAT I'M THINKING.

346
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,527
- OKAY, THANKS, JOHN.
- ANYTIME, RICK.

347
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,723
- WHEN HE SAID IT WAS WORTH
BETWEEN $5,000 AND $10,000,

348
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,231
MAN, I WAS PUMPED.

349
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,790
THAT WAS GREAT NEWS.

350
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,335
- SO HOW MUCH YOU WANT FOR IT?

351
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,304
- WELL, HE SAID IT WAS
WORTH AROUND $5,000,

352
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,704
AND, HEY, I JUST WANT
TO START OUT AT $5,000.

353
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:30,243
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M ASSUMING

354
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,835
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF IT, MAYBE.

355
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,540
I REALLY THINK $3,000'S IT.

356
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,549
- HOW ABOUT $3,500?

357
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,915
- I'LL GO $3,200.

358
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,058
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

359
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,892
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT, MAN.

360
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,955
GO WRITE HIM UP, CHUM.
- I'LL MEET YOU OVER THERE.

361
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,228
- I'VE FIRED A LOT OF
OLD GUNS BEFORE,

362
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,963
BUT I'VE NEVER FIRED
A 200-YEAR-OLD MUSKET

363
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,006
MADE FOR A KID, SO
LET'S SEE WHAT IT'LL DO.

364
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,708
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

365
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,251
WHAT DO WE GOT?
- I GOT THESE FROM MY COUSIN.

366
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,253
AND I KNOW THEY'RE
AT LEAST 25 YEARS OLD,

367
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,686
BUT I'M NOT SURE.

368
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,554
WE ASSUMED THEY
WERE CASINO MARKERS,

369
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,183
WHERE THEY'D PUT
THEM IN FRONT OF YOU

370
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,522
IF YOU OWED THE CASINO MONEY.

371
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,062
- YOU GOT TO BE IN
PRETTY BAD SHAPE

372
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,907
IF YOU'RE GONNA BORROW
20 BUCKS FROM A CASINO.

373
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,866
[laughter]
- OKAY, YEAH.

374
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,200
COME DOWN TO THE PAWN SHOP TODAY

375
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,795
TO TRY TO SELL WHAT I THINK
ARE VERY RARE CASINO MARKERS.

376
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,363
SO I THINK THEY'RE
WORTH SOME MONEY.

377
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,703
PLUS, THEY LOOK PRETTY COOL.

378
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,539
I'M HOPING TO GET $1,240,

379
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,739
BUT THE LOWEST I'LL GO ON
THEM IS $620, THEIR FACE VALUE.

380
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,304
- SO WHERE DID YOU GET THESE?

381
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,214
- MY COUSIN'S HAD THEM
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS.

382
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,295
MY ASSUMPTION WAS, THEY USED
TO THROW THEM IN FRONT OF YOU

383
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,618
WHEN YOU'D BORROW MONEY
AND YOU'RE SITTING AT THE TABLE.

384
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,054
- NO, THESE ARE NOT MARKERS.

385
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,285
WHAT THESE ARE IS,
THEY'RE BACCARAT CHIPS.

386
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,690
I THINK THEY'RE CALLED PLACARDS.

387
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,228
THE REASON THEY
MADE THEM LIKE THIS:

388
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,388
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER
TO TELL WHAT THEY ARE

389
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,056
AS OPPOSED TO A PILE OF CHIPS,

390
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,943
AND THAT'S WHY THEY USE
THEM LIKE THIS IN EUROPE.

391
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,629
AND THESE PARTICULAR
ONES LIKE THIS,

392
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,432
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT
TO COUNTERFEIT.

393
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,848
WHAT I CAN TELL
YOU ABOUT THESE IS,

394
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,137
THEY DID NOT MAKE A LOT OF THEM.

395
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,971
BACCARAT IS A CASINO CARD GAME

396
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,773
USUALLY RESERVED FOR
THE HIGHEST OF HIGH ROLLERS,

397
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,781
AND CASINOS CAN WIN OR
LOSE MILLIONS IN A NIGHT.

398
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,182
BUT MOST OF THE TIME, I
THINK THE CASINO WINS.

399
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,652
- I WAS ASSUMING
THEY WERE MARKERS,

400
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,231
WHICH I THOUGHT THAT
WOULD MAKE IT COOLER.

401
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,855
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A
BACCARAT ROOM, SO...

402
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,300
- I THINK IT MAKES
IT A LITTLE COOLER

403
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,917
THAT IT'S, YOU KNOW, BACCARAT.

404
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,485
YOU KNOW HOW BIG THE JAMES
BOND FLICKS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN.

405
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,088
BACK IN THE DAY, JAMES
BOND PLAYS BACCARAT, OKAY?

406
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,827
SO WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO DO WITH THEM?

407
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,911
- I WANT TO SELL THEM.
- HOW MUCH YOU WANT FOR THESE?

408
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,198
- FACE VALUE?

409
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,932
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, NO.

410
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,816
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
IF THEY HAVE AN OLD CHIP,

411
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,584
THEY CAN JUST GO TO
THE CASINO AND CASH IT IN.

412
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,803
DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY.

413
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,105
CASINOS DO THIS ALL THE TIME.

414
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,476
THEY PUT AN AD IN THE NEWSPAPER.

415
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,742
YOU GOT 30 DAYS TO
TURN IN YOUR CHIPS.

416
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,841
AFTER THAT, THEY'RE WORTHLESS.

417
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,749
EVEN THOUGH THESE
CHIPS HAVE NO CASH VALUE,

418
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,721
THEY'RE STILL WORTH MONEY
TO COLLECTORS OF CASINO STUFF.

419
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,833
SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT,
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR THEM?

420
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,621
- HOW MUCH WILL YOU
GIVE ME FOR THEM?

421
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,854
- I WILL GIVE YOU $100,
I WILL GIVE YOU $50,

422
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,294
AND I WILL GIVE YOU $20.

423
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,831
- SO $170.
- THAT IS IT.

424
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,332
- YOU CAN'T DO BETTER THAN THAT?

425
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,028
- AT LEAST YOU GET
THE FACE VALUE ON ONE.

426
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,229
[laughter]

427
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,739
- AT THE BOTTOM. HOW ABOUT $270?

428
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,469
- I'LL GO $200 BUCKS. I
WON'T GO A DIME MORE.

429
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,974
- I CAN'T DO IT FOR $200.
- OKAY.

430
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,795
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS
FOR BRINGING THEM IN.

431
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,048
I APPRECIATE IT.
- THANK YOU.

432
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,918
YEAH, I'M KIND OF DISAPPOINTED.

433
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,719
I WANTED TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS.

434
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,869
AND, AH, I'LL JUST KEEP THEM
AND PUT THEM UP IN MY BAR.

435
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,259
I THINK THEY LOOK PRETTY COOL.

436
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,355
I'LL GIVE THEM ANOTHER
20 YEARS TO SIMMER.

437
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,683
- WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

438
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,746
- GOT THE FIRST THREE
YEARS OF <i>SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.</i>

439
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,258
- YOU GOT THE ISSUE WHERE
LEBRON WENT TO MIAMI?

440
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,692
- NOT OUT YET.

441
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,140
I DECIDED TO COME TO THE PAWN
SHOP TODAY TO TRY AND SELL

442
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,909
MY FIRST THREE SEASONS
OF <i>SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.</i>

443
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,731
FOUND THEM IN THE ATTIC.

444
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,146
THEY SHOULD JUST BE OUT THERE.
SOME COLLECTOR SHOULD HAVE 'EM.

445
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,729
I DON'T WANT THEM
TO GO TO THE WAYSIDE.

446
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,604
I'M LOOKING FOR, YOU
KNOW, MAYBE AROUND $1,000.

447
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,144
- IT'S A REALLY COOL MAGAZINE,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE COLLECT IT.

448
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,578
I MEAN, THE FACT THAT YOU GOT
THE FIRST THREE SEASONS OF IT,

449
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,047
THAT MEANS A LOT.

450
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,743
- WHEN YOU USED TO
GET THESE AS A KID,

451
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,861
THOSE BIG, BLOWN-UP PICTURES,
YOU NEVER SAW IT BEFORE.

452
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,615
I HAD THEM TAPED ON MY WALLS.

453
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,865
- A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL LISTENED
TO THE GAMES ON THE RADIO.

454
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,324
AND THEY ONLY GOT
ONE GAME AT A TIME.

455
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,224
THIS IS HOW YOU
KEPT UP WITH SPORTS.

456
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,422
WHEN <i>SPORTS ILLUSTRATED</i>
CAME OUT IN 1954,

457
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,489
PEOPLE LAUGHED AT THE IDEA
OF AN ALL-SPORTS MAGAZINE.

458
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,865
NOBODY THOUGHT
ANYBODY WOULD READ IT.

459
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,895
WANT TO SHOW ME SOME OF
THE COOLEST ONES YOU HAVE?

460
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,530
- SURE. THE FIRST ISSUE.

461
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,074
REAL BIG, AND THE DRAW
IS, THEY HAVE ALL THESE...

462
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,134
ALL THE OLD COLLECTOR
BASEBALL CARDS IN THEM, INSERTS.

463
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,644
IF YOU CUT THEM
UP, THEY'RE NO GOOD.

464
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,223
APPARENTLY, IF YOU
KEEP THEM IN THE BOOK,

465
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,909
THEY'RE WORTH SOME MONEY NOW.

466
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,008
SECOND ISSUE AS WELL,
BUT THEY'RE ALL THE YANKEES.

467
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,677
THE BIG DRAW IS MICKEY MANTLE.

468
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,517
THEN, OF COURSE, YOU GOT
THE FIRST-EVER SWIMSUIT EDITION.

469
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,955
CHECK HER OUT. SHE'S HOT, HUH?

470
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,252
- WAH, WAH, WHEE-WAH.

471
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,021
[laughter]

472
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,119
- SO ARE ALL THE MAGAZINES
IN GOOD CONDITION OR...

473
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,494
- RIGHT FROM THE STAND.
- WOW.

474
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,089
THIS IS AN AMAZING COLLECTION,

475
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,930
AND IT'S GREAT THAT
THEY'RE FROM A NEWSSTAND

476
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,799
AND DON'T HAVE
MAILING LABELS ON THEM.

477
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,531
THAT MAKES THEM
MUCH MORE VALUABLE,

478
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,471
BUT THE PRICE HAS TO BE RIGHT,

479
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,032
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE A
LONG TIME TO SELL THEM ALL.

480
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,887
SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO
DO, MAN, PAWN THEM OR SELL THEM?

481
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,470
- I'M GONNA SELL THEM.

482
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,223
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING TO GET FOR THEM?

483
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,047
- COULD BE WITH 1,000
BUCKS, AND THEN YOU GUYS

484
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,711
COULD PROBABLY DOUBLE
YOUR MONEY ON THAT.

485
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,596
- YOU GOT TO REMEMBER,
EACH ONE OF THESE MAGAZINES,

486
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,282
A GUY'S GOT TO
SIT AT A COMPUTER,

487
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,883
WRITE A DESCRIPTION ON,
AND IT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME.

488
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,325
- I HEAR YOU.

489
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,363
- MY COMFORT
AREA IS AROUND $500.

490
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,796
- WELL, $500, I MEAN, THE
FIRST TWO ISSUES ALONE,

491
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,357
YOU GUYS COULD
PROBABLY GET $400, $500

492
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,732
FOR THOSE FIRST COUPLE ISSUES.

493
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,046
SOMEONE WILL BUY THIS WHOLE SET.

494
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,972
BUT, YOU KNOW, $900?

495
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,118
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MAN.
I'LL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.

496
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,168
I'LL GO $750. IT'S THE
BEST I'M GONNA DO.

497
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,478
- THAT'S FAIR. I'LL TAKE IT.

498
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,247
- THAT'S FAIR? ALL RIGHT.
- YOU GOT A DEAL.

499
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,084
- MY MAN CHUMLEE
HERE WILL WRITE YOU UP.

500
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,666
- GREAT. WELL, WE GOT
DONE WITH THE DEAL.

501
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,659
I MADE IT FOR
$750. THAT'S GREAT.

502
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,159
I'M GONNA PROBABLY
TAKE MY WIFE OUT

503
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,287
TO A NICE DINNER TONIGHT.

504
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,122
- EARLIER, I BOUGHT

505
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,258
AN 18TH-CENTURY HALF-SIZE
MUSKET MADE FOR A KID.

506
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,769
SO SEAN AND I ARE ON OUR WAY
TO GO SEE IF THIS THING FIRES.

507
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,328
SINCE WE DON'T WANT TO
RISK HARMING ANY ACTUAL KIDS,

508
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,272
WE BROUGHT CHUM ALONG INSTEAD.

509
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,641
- NOW, BACK IN THE
DAY, THIS GUN WAS USED

510
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,647
BY PROBABLY A 10-
OR 12-YEAR-OLD BOY.

511
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,616
THE ORIGINAL MUSKET WOULD
HAVE HAD A 46-INCH BARREL,

512
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,018
WHERE THIS WHOLE ENTIRE
GUN IS ONLY 46 INCHES,

513
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,555
BUT EVERYTHING IN DETAIL,

514
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,784
AGAIN, IS JUST HALF THE SIZE.

515
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,383
BUT WE'RE GONNA SEE WHAT
KIND OF DAMAGE IT WILL DO.

516
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,621
- ALL RIGHT.

517
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,027
I'M READY TO DEFEND YOU.

518
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,190
[laughter]

519
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,257
- EVEN THOUGH THIS GUN
WAS MADE FOR KIDS AND...

520
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,598
I'M NOT GONNA LET CHUM
JUST TAKE IT AND RUN WITH IT.

521
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,399
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT I'M HERE.

522
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,133
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA LOAD THIS

523
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,300
WITH ABOUT 70 GRAINS OF POWDER.

524
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,775
THE STANDARD MILITARY MUSKET

525
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,403
WOULD TAKE ABOUT
100 TO 120 GRAINS.

526
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,107
WE'RE GONNA DO
THIS WITH HALF THAT.

527
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,616
- JUST ENOUGH TO HURT ME, HUH?
- JUST ENOUGH.

528
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,652
ALL RIGHT, SO, CHUM,
THIS IS YOUR TARGET.

529
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,085
- ALL RIGHT.

530
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,145
- SO I'M GONNA BE
STATIONING CHUM

531
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,316
ABOUT 25 FEET AWAY
FROM THE TARGET,

532
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,723
WHICH IS A WATER-FILLED BALLOON.

533
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,090
- ALL RIGHT, CHUM,
YOU MAKE THIS,

534
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,560
YOU GET A BUCKET
OF GREASY CHICKEN.

535
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,563
- NOW YOU'RE TALKING
MY LANGUAGE, RICK.

536
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,893
LET'S DO THIS.

537
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,341
[gunshot]

538
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,352
[laughter] BAM!

539
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,321
DO NOT MESS WITH UNCLE RICKY!

540
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,254
- CHUM DID REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

541
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,368
THE FIRST SHOT, HE HIT THE
TARGET, BLEW THE BALLOON UP.

542
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,486
IT'S A REALLY GOOD FEELING
WHEN YOU PULL THE TRIGGER

543
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,841
AND YOU ACTUALLY HIT THE TARGET,

544
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,307
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU HAVE AN AUDIENCE.

545
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,357
- NO ONE'S GONNA GET
YOU WHILE I'M HERE.

546
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,834
- THAT'S RIGHT, CHUM. AND
YOU GET A BUCKET OF CHICKEN.

547
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,837
EXTRA GREASY.

548
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,031
- THAT'S HOW I LIKE IT.

549
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,802
- [laughs]
- NICE.
