I hung up, then I met Alicia...

519
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:05,783
and then I went,
"Oh, now I got you! I got you."

520
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,620
I got it. Can I kiss her? Is that...

521
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:12,355
Absolutely!
Hey, what are you doing?

522
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:22,699

and watch cartoons all day...

1172
01:53:47,334 --> 01:53:50,201
