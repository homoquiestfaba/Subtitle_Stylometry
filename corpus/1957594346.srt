1
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:16,535
(pensive music)

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,079
- [Edward] When Johnny left for Hollywood,

3
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,709
I told him I'd come visit him one day.

4
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,339
And when I did, we'd take
a tour of one of those

5
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:34,029
movie studios.

6
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,059
I had this theory that's where the ghosts

7
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,689
of legends lived.

8
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:43,586
John Bandini drank Wild Turkey,

9
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:45,996
rode his motorcycle fast and drunk

10
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,626
with no helmet.

11
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:51,256
He left for Hollywood a
year ago to become a legend,

12
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:52,993
got the starring role in a big movie,

13
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:54,893
and then drove his '68 black and white

14
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:57,803
BSA motorcycle around the set,

15
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:00,103
destroying everything.

16
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:04,143
His phone hadn't rung since.

17
00:01:08,563 --> 00:01:09,457
(engine rumbling)

18
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:11,287
I went to see him.

19
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:14,772
(engine rumbling)

20
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,432
I hadn't seen Johnny for a year.

21
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,742
While he was in Hollywood
becoming a legend,

22
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:31,192
I was at home sober
becoming a shoe repairman.

23
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:35,500
- [Elner] These will get you to Hollywood.

24
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:37,962
- Thanks, Elner.

25
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:40,642
It's perfect.

26
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:49,822
- Look inside, Edward.

27
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:52,682
Always look inside first.

28
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:58,132
A small bonus for the
best shoe man I have had

29
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:01,562
since Erwin Clank, bless his soul.

30
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:04,002
- Thanks, Elner.

31
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:08,294
Thanks, Joanne.

32
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,494
Thank you.

33
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:12,094
Thanks.

34
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:16,914
(pensive music)

35
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:18,754
Okay.

36
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:25,064
Well, thanks again.

37
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:26,634
- Oh, come on.

38
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:30,424
I'll miss you.

39
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:34,854
(pensive music)

40
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:36,104
- You've got everything?

41
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:37,664
You have your money, your tickets?

42
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:38,694
- Yeah.

43
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:41,794
- Watch out for that elbow.

44
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,024
- Oh.

45
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:45,964
No, no.

46
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:47,814
None of that.

47
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,224
I'm fine.

48
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:50,314
- Good.

49
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:54,334
- Well, go. Go.

50
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:55,634
- Go.

51
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:59,829
(plane whizzing)

52
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,069
- [Elner] Say hello to Charle
Chaplin for me, will you?

53
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,394
- [Joanne] Bye, Edward!

54
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:07,444
- [Voiceover] Now arriving, Hollywood.

55
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:08,266
Now arriving.

56
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,296
- [Edward] I learned a
great deal as a shoe man.

57
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:13,386
I learned there's no
money in patching soles.

58
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:15,446
It's not profitable to the customer

59
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,056
nor to the repairer.

60
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:19,586
In fact, it's better to wear the shoe out,

61
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:23,056
eat it down until it's
almost completely destroyed.

62
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:26,756
And then you're ready
for a whole new sole.

63
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:28,871
- [Voiceover] Jesus is
knocking on the door

64
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,671
of your heart today.

65
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,751
(cheerful piano music)

66
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:36,446
(laughing loudly)

67
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:38,726
(cheerful piano music)

68
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:40,306
- So eat that jerky!

69
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:41,591
Jerky, piss, piss!

70
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,211
You stupid dick!

71
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,686
Dick!

72
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,716
(cheerful piano music)

73
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:50,088
♫ I love applause ♫

74
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:52,088
- I like this song better.

75
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:58,803
- I've got (muffled speech).

76
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:01,803
- I've got like Tuesday, Tuesday night,

77
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:03,273
Wednesday.

78
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:04,818
- [Woman] Wednesday?

79
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:08,592
(cheerful piano music)

80
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:17,792
- (exhales loudly) John
Bandini's room, please.

81
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:19,392
- No John Bandini here.

82
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:22,622
- It's the Hollywood Hotel, 110 Winston?

83
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:23,932
- Yeah.

84
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,317
- John Bandini.

85
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,567
- Um-um.

86
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:34,177
(laughter in the background)

87
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:39,697
- All right.

88
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,487
I'll take a room then, preferably one

89
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,057
with an alley view.

90
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:45,647
- Sorry, sir.

91
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:48,257
All the rooms with an
alley view's been taken.

92
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:53,177
- Whatever you got, then.

93
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:55,897
(door creaking)

94
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:06,707
(loud scraping)

95
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,047
(blows loudly)

96
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,077
(clapping)

97
00:05:57,436 --> 00:06:00,176
- [Edward] Errol Flynn,
at his own birthday party,

98
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:02,376
went to the cemetery and
dug up his best friend,

99
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,826
John Barrymore, from the grave.

100
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:06,746
He took him back to the party.

101
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,016
He propped him up on a
chair, and placed a drink

102
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:14,016
in his hand, just so
they could be together.

103
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:16,596
Hollywood!

104
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:18,916
John Bandini.

105
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,336
- You just remember what Huey Long said,

106
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:21,236
"Every man's a king."

107
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,846
And I'm the king around here.

108
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,066
And I'm the king around here.

109
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,006
Here, here.

110
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:30,726
Here.

111
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,906
- Los Angeles.

112
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:36,526
John Bandini.

113
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:40,426
- Huh! Huh!

114
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:43,666
- Harr!

115
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:44,946
- Ugh!

116
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:46,356
- Vrr!

117
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:48,506
- Can you try Beverly Hills?

118
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:53,046
(crying loudly)

119
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:02,126
I didn't think so.

120
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:06,026
Thank you.

121
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:07,326
(dial tone)

122
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,436
(exhales loudly)

123
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:16,986
(pensive music)

124
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,066
- [Edward] Drinking was like taking a ride

125
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:29,046
in a time machine, with
hundreds of buttons

126
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:30,816
that had no labels.

127
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:36,886
Where I wouuld arrive, I would never know.

128
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:41,416
(pensive music)

129
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:54,656
(strong vibration)

130
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,511
- Earthquake.

131
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:01,761
- Oh, shit!

132
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,611
(alarm blaring)

133
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:13,031
(loud crash)

134
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:19,251
(alarm blaring)

135
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:48,891
(loud bang)

136
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:52,511
(shouting out)

137
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,361
(exhales loudly)

138
00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:00,931
(strained grunting)

139
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,451
(loud hissing)

140
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:20,948
(loud grunting)

141
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:31,492
- Uh, Edward?

142
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:42,812
(elevator dings)

143
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:45,022
- Johnny.

144
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:49,292
(cheerful music)

145
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:54,062
- How the fuck are you, man?

146
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,712
(Edward groaning)

147
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:01,772
You look great.

148
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:05,082
- I haven't had a drink in six months.

149
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,652
- [Johnny] No shit.

150
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:14,982
- Hey, the guy at the front
desk said there's no Bandini.

151
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,498
- Yeah.

152
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,398
Johnny Chance.

153
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:21,918
Screen name.

154
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:23,738
- Hey!

155
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:26,788
You still got old Sparky?

156
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:27,748
- Yeah.

157
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:29,149
- And is she running?

158
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:30,709
- She's not.

159
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,779
- Oh.

160
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:34,796
Hey, I got something for you.

161
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,668
- That's cool.

162
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:08,563
That's really cool, man.

163
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,283
That's cool.

164
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:16,793
- [Edward] You like them?

165
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:17,453
- Yeah, man.

166
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,803
They're cool.

167
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,043
Thanks, man.

168
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,683
It's good to see you, man.

169
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:35,273
(loud cheer and applause)

170
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:36,603
- [Voiceover] Well!

171
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:41,693
(funky music)

172
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:48,883
- Tom Cruise is...

173
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:51,673
What was it?

174
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:56,404
What's, what...

175
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:07,774
(funky music)

176
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,114
(loud punch)

177
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:14,424
(muffled funky music)

178
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:19,984
- Oh, you fucking used me!

179
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:25,114
All those guys bigger than Brando

180
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:28,334
and De Niro and Pacino.

181
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:31,144
Fuck those guys, man!

182
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:36,219
I make James Dean look like Barney Rubble!

183
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:39,284
(funky music)

184
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:41,364
♫ I want to tell you what to do

185
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:46,144
♫ I will take you to school

186
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:50,082
♫ I would be your teacher

187
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,042
♫ They let you out for a reason

188
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,205
♫ Come play with me ♫

189
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:04,655
- Let's make a toast.

190
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:09,655
(funky music)

191
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,600
- I look good.

192
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:32,462
- Yeah.

193
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:33,982
- I look really good, you know.

194
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:36,322
Like even today, I'm completely hungover,

195
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:39,102
and I look good, you know.

196
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:40,792
And it's not just physical.

197
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:43,389
I'm magnetic.

198
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,679
I have this magnetism.

199
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,749
- Yeah, I was thinking that this morning

200
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,569
when I saw you passed out on the floor.

201
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,609
I was very drawn to you.

202
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:54,089
- No, just, it's not ego.

203
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:55,149
I'm saying--

204
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,809
- No, I'm not--

205
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,689
- I know what I am, you know.

206
00:13:58,689 --> 00:13:59,209
- Yeah.

207
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:02,269
- I, I have to know what I
am, and I am good-looking.

208
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,169
- Yeah.

209
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,729
- And I am magnetic.

210
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:06,979
- Yeah.

211
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,739
Check out that car, man.

212
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:19,339
That is a nice car.

213
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,099
- That's a really nice car.

214
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,489
- [Edward] My mother always
said that Johnny and I

215
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,779
shouldn't hang out together.

216
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,549
She said we would both
end up like Butch Cassidy

217
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:42,319
and the Sundance Kid, dead
in some Mexican prison.

218
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:46,869
I told my mom that Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid

219
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,939
didn't die in a Mexican prison.

220
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:51,539
They were actually shot to death.

221
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:53,836
- Johnny, what are you doing?

222
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:55,896
Are you trying to hot-wire this thing?

223
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,022
- I need a screwdriver.

224
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,382
- So, what are you doing?

225
00:14:58,382 --> 00:14:59,482
- I have no idea.

226
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,362
- Well, shouldn't you get one?

227
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:02,982
- A screwdriver?

228
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,332
- No, an idea.

229
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:06,852
- Yeah, because that would be nice.

230
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:08,802
- Johnny, you're in a stolen car.

231
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:10,042
- It's not officially stolen yet.

232
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:15,141
- Then, let's do it.

233
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,641
Move over.

234
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:17,532
- You know how to work it?

235
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:18,432
- Oh, yeah.

236
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:20,142
No problem.

237
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:23,242
- Nice car.

238
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:26,002
- Thanks.

239
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:29,062
- Yeah, this is a sweet car!

240
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:32,057
283 horse, 290 fuel injection.

241
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,197
V8, right?

242
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:34,204
- Three-six.

243
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:37,194
- Call me crazy, but I'm counting
nine teeth on this grill.

244
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:40,456
The 458, all the engines were straight six

245
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,381
and the grills had 13 teeth.

246
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:44,211
This has nine.

247
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,511
- Yeah?

248
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:48,132
- That'll make it a V, bro.

249
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:51,589
- Well, some of the teeth came off.

250
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,279
- Ain't that a bitch?

251
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:55,289
Ooh, leather.

252
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,419
(The Blue Danube Waltz playing)

253
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:01,886
Ooh, soft as mozarella leather.

254
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:04,173
- [Johnny] That's Jack Spain.

255
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:04,880
- [Edward] The actor?

256
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,437
- [Johnny] Yeah.

257
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:06,277
- [Edward] No way.

258
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:07,268
Jack Spain's like bigger.

259
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:08,938
He's got darker hair.

260
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,600
- Hey, this license
plate, it says, "N TENSE."

261
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,891
Which one of you is N Tense?

262
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:13,691
- He is.

263
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:15,031
- You are?

264
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:16,231
- Uh, yeah.

265
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:17,841
- Well, hello, N Tense.

266
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,351
How come you ain't
driving your car, N Tense?

267
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:22,151
- Uh, I don't know,

268
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:25,121
just feeling a little too
tense, I guess (chuckles).

269
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:28,051
- Well, the thing is, when
you're driving this car,

270
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:30,531
everybody is looking at you, am I right?

271
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,791
And you know what they think?

272
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,471
Silently to themselves, they're thinking,

273
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,841
"I want to fuck N Tense."

274
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:38,931
Yeah, even straight guys want to,

275
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,211
because he is so cool.

276
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:42,231
He's got a cool name.

277
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:44,126
He's got a cool antique 'vette.

278
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,566
He's as cool as they come.

279
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,806
And everybody, I mean everybody,

280
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:51,586
wants to fuck Mr. N Tense.

281
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:54,041
I sure wouldn't want to fuck
with that N Tense, though.

282
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,478
No, sirree, no.

283
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:57,838
Nope.

284
00:16:57,838 --> 00:17:02,190
I bet that Mr. N Tense
is a bad motherbrother.

285
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,996
Actually, I wouldn't be surprised

286
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:10,266
if Mr. N Tense had a
big, shiny, loaded gun

287
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:13,136
in case somebody tried to fuck with him.

288
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,243
- No, no, no!

289
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,693
Just get your--

290
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:24,473
- Autograph?

291
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:29,633
Hold the paper still.

292
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,353
Now, both of you, get
out of my fucking car.

293
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:49,443
(tires screeching)

294
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,933
- Nice car.

295
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:06,402
♫ Lord, I think I lost my sense of humor

296
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,702
♫ But maybe it's hidden at the bottom

297
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:10,602
♫ Of a Beaujolais

298
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:13,539
♫ German wine is a lot like Rhine

299
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,439
♫ It's cold and it's quick

300
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,849
♫ And it's sweeping me away

301
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:19,289
♫ It's cold and it's quick

302
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:21,309
♫ And it's sweeping me away

303
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,154
♫ Be it French or Italian

304
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:25,407
♫ Chenin blanc, Cabernet

305
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:29,465
♫ Be it day-old crackers
or a Domino's pizza, man

306
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:30,717
♫ Hey, how you doing

307
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:33,637
♫ It's so good to meet you, man

308
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,237
♫ Keep the change now

309
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:37,177
♫ Don't be strange now

310
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:38,957
♫ I'm glad to know that

311
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:40,807
♫ You're in a Range now

312
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:44,267
♫ Fix me up when I'm too drunk to drive

313
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,247
♫ But don't get me wrong

314
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:50,074
♫ Because I don't strive to be ♫

315
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:15,611
- Oh, fuck.

316
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:21,368
(blowdryer blasting)

317
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:34,568
(door creaking)

318
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,548
- Nobody called?

319
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:41,708
- Huh?

320
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:43,308
- [Johnny] Nobody called?

321
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,548
- No.

322
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:49,548
- Can you fix it?

323
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:51,368
- What?

324
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,738
- The bike!

325
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:54,348
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,048
- The phone's wet.

327
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:10,632
- Seriously?

328
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:15,392
(Johnny exhales loudly)

329
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:17,622
- Did you fuck with the phone?

330
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:18,702
- No.

331
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:23,652
- Well, it won't dial out.

332
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,322
- Seriously?

333
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:31,629
- It smells like piss.

334
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,019
- Seriously?

335
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:52,171
- You fucking pissed on my $100

336
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:56,124
whole button automatic
redial phone, Edward.

337
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:01,044
- I'm sorry.

338
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:13,085
- Edward, what are you doing?

339
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,955
- Just having a little drink.

340
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:16,815
- Could you just start
drinking at night, man?

341
00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:18,225
That's what I do.

342
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:19,495
- What's the difference?

343
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:20,815
- You start drinking in the morning,

344
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:22,475
and you're pissing on phones by 2 a.m.

345
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:24,115
That's the fucking difference.

346
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,005
Just cool out, man.

347
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:27,725
Edward!

348
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:29,005
- What?

349
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:31,155
- You don't come in here
and start screwing up

350
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,245
my life for me, man!

351
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:36,635
I've got a broken
motorcycle, and I'm virtually

352
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:38,255
blacklisted in this town.

353
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,675
All I've got is Jack Spain's autograph.

354
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,915
And if I had a chance in hell

355
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,255
of getting a call for a
job now, I've got a sticky

356
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:48,025
fucking piss-smelling phone to get it on!

357
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:54,535
(sighs) I mean, Jesus!

358
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:56,105
Edward!

359
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:03,125
- I guess this means the
studio tour thing is out.

360
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:06,625
- Oh, no, no, of course not.

361
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:09,265
Let me call and make reservations.

362
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:13,880
Oh, ding bats, I can't!

363
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,020
I forgot!

364
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,250
The phone won't dial out!

365
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,330
(phone slamming)

366
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,910
(exhales loudly)

367
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,525
Can I have a little bit of that?

368
00:22:56,315 --> 00:23:00,325
(laughs loudly)

369
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:05,015
(pensive music)

370
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:06,385
(muffled siren blaring)

371
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,365
- Johnny, can we go on

372
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:11,499
that studio tour thing?

373
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,099
Johnny.

374
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:27,666
Every day, I look outside, it's raining.

375
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,986
Typical. Gray.

376
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:31,876
Whatever.

377
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,366
It doesn't matter.

378
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:37,146
Because you go to a
bar, have six drinks and

379
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:41,046
it all becomes interesting.

380
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:46,786
And you stop remembering after 10.

381
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,331
Bartender looks at you funny.

382
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,771
And you wake up.

383
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,426
And there's a road sign in your shower,

384
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:08,766
and your shirt's ripped
and your hand's cut

385
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:10,686
and you have no idea
how you spent 200 bucks

386
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:12,236
in one night.

387
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:16,586
And you'll never see that beautiful woman

388
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:21,356
you were kissing in the bar ever again.

389
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:26,716
But you wake up.

390
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:33,966
You eat a cheese sandwich, drink a Coke,

391
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:37,908
and it tastes like fucking magic.

392
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:42,168
Yeah, something happened.

393
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:46,608
Something out of the ordinary.

394
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:52,148
Something out of the fucking mundane.

395
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:56,098
(upbeat drumming)

396
00:24:56,098 --> 00:24:58,198
- [Voiceover] Still in
Hollywood, James Dean's star

397
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:01,038
was stolen sometime
around 3 a.m. this morning

398
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:03,478
from the streets of Hollywood Boulevard.

399
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:06,098
- [Edward] Maybe we should
get out of town for a while,

400
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:07,938
go to Mexico or something.

401
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:09,978
- [Johnny] Why would I want
to go to Mexico right now?

402
00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:11,198
- It's just an idea, Johnny.

403
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,658
You don't have to get excited about it.

404
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:15,598
- [Voiceover] They say it was
smashed up with a jackhammer

405
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:16,798
and carried away.

406
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,348
- That's uncool! Fuck cool!

407
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,098
- [Voiceover] Witnesses
claim they saw a man running

408
00:25:22,098 --> 00:25:25,598
with a 100-pound slab of
cement down the boulevard.

409
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:27,198
- Jesus, I thought you'd like it.

410
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:28,978
- What, you thought I'd like it?

411
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:30,878
- Yeah, I thought you'd like it.

412
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:32,578
- [Voiceover] The Avenue of
the Stars Committee plans

413
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:34,558
to replace the star with
a new one while the police

414
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,538
continue to search for the suspect.

415
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,678
The star is one of the
first ever on the boulevard.

416
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:42,018
It had been there since 1958.

417
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:44,398
- I'm just, I'm not interested
in going down this road

418
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:45,378
with you, Edward.

419
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,898
If you want to do shit
like this, it's fine.

420
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:51,938
Just, just, you should do it alone.

421
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:55,198
I'm not going to be your
excuse for a drinking buddy,

422
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:56,798
all right?

423
00:25:56,798 --> 00:25:59,258
So why don't you just, just

424
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,158
get out, man?

425
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:03,178
Just get out!

426
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:04,158
- All right, I will.

427
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:05,038
- Good. Leave.

428
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:06,278
Now, man.

429
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:07,768
- I will.

430
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:14,988
- Edward!

431
00:26:23,018 --> 00:26:26,348
Get the fuck out and
take your booze with you!

432
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:27,758
- Fine, fine, I will.

433
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:28,498
- Get out!

434
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:29,888
(door slams)

435
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:16,628
- You're going to kick
my ass out of here, huh?

436
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:21,348
You're going to fuck
with me, Johnny Chance?

437
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:26,468
Huh?

438
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:32,848
Oh, I come in and fuck up your life, huh?

439
00:27:33,658 --> 00:27:37,098
I come in and screw up
your Hollywood world, huh?

440
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:37,998
- Edward, get the fuck out of here.

441
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:38,758
- No!

442
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,398
Because I've got a
fucking point, all right?

443
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,615
The point is,

444
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,315
we are fucked up.

445
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:50,765
We are both fucked up.

446
00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:52,085
- Edward, I'm not as fucked up as you.

447
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:53,185
- No!

448
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:55,755
The point is

449
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:57,625
we are both fucked up!

450
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,785
- Dude, you're way more fucked up than me.

451
00:27:58,785 --> 00:27:59,945
- You're not listening!

452
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,865
The point is we are fucked up together!

453
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:05,105
We are fucked up together!

454
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:09,380
And this, this is a slab of cement,

455
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,820
and it means nothing,
and he means nothing,

456
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,000
and nobody but the--

457
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,280
- Dude, put that ax away.

458
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,399
- Construction workers who
have to put the fucking

459
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:18,139
thing back--

460
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:18,619
- Edward!

461
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:19,359
- Will give a shit.

462
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,459
And they really don't care!

463
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:20,959
- Edward!

464
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:21,979
- Because they're getting paid for it.

465
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:23,219
- Edward! Edward!

466
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:26,549
Edward!

467
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,589
(loud crash)

468
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:34,889
(punching)

469
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:37,746
(loud crash)

470
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:41,825
(grunting)

471
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:45,985
(punching)

472
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:56,129
(grunting)

473
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,239
(phone ringing)

474
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:05,439
(grunting)

475
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:10,289
(phone ringing)

476
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,609
- Hello?

477
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:22,259
You're going to have to talk louder.

478
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,449
Edward pissed on my phone.

479
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,229
Yeah!

480
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:30,059
Uh, okay.

481
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,229
Uh, uh.

482
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,109
Hang on.

483
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:41,209
Okay, where?

484
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,909
Yeah, um, yeah, that's fine.

485
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:45,719
That's great.

486
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,109
Thank you!

487
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:55,489
I gotta go meet this guy.

488
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,326
- What time?

489
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:58,548
- Four.

490
00:30:01,238 --> 00:30:02,688
(exhales loudly)

491
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:19,248
- These will get you the part.

492
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:22,568
- Thanks, man.

493
00:30:26,818 --> 00:30:28,548
- Look inside.

494
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:31,448
Always gotta look inside.

495
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:36,708
- I remember that.

496
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:43,305
Thanks, man.

497
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,090
- [Casting Woman] Johnny Chance?

498
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,150
- [Johnny] Uh, it's Bandini, actually.

499
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,510
John Bandini.

500
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,490
(soft footsteps)

501
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,098
- Hello, Stuart.

502
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,528
- [Stuart] Hey there, Johnny.

503
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:17,548
Where is your motorcycle?

504
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:21,413
- (chuckles) I left it at home.

505
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,583
It's not really, uh, working.

506
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:30,083
So, um, you want me to do this?

507
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:40,423
(pensive music)

508
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:52,563
(engine rumbling)

509
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,663
- That's fine, Johnny.

510
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:13,383
That's fine.

511
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,003
You have all this passion.

512
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:29,883
You just don't know what
the hell to do with it.

513
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:33,163
You're pretty good, you know?

514
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:43,174
We're going to have to cut your hair.

515
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:49,174
- (chuckles) Thanks, Stuart.

516
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:54,654
(soft footsteps)

517
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:06,314
- (giggles) Come in.

518
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:20,034
(laughs loudly)

519
00:34:24,984 --> 00:34:27,164
- Edward, how did you, uh--

520
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:30,264
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

521
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:32,274
How'd it go?

522
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:35,964
- I drove my motorcycle
around this guy's set,

523
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:38,734
and he wants to be my best friend.

524
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:44,014
- You only got one of those.

525
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:47,174
Get on.

526
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:47,984
- You want me to get on the bike?

527
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:48,864
- Yeah, I want you to get on the bike.

528
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:49,404
- You want me on the bike?

529
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:50,279
- I want you to get on the bike.

530
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:51,519
Just get on.

531
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,679
- All right.

532
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,199
- Just get on.

533
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,789
- I'll get on the bike.

534
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,719
Where are we going?

535
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,799
(engine rumbling)

536
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:00,169
(laughs loudly)

537
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:02,919
- We're going to do a
tour of the movie studio.

538
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:05,619
(engine rumbling)

539
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:10,269
(pensive music)

540
00:35:19,394 --> 00:35:21,326
- [Edward] Johnny and I were
well-versed in the ability

541
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:23,926
to learn the truths in life
by repeating our mistakes

542
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:27,586
over and over until they were so ingrained

543
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:30,426
in our character that we
would only have to repeat

544
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:33,966
the mistake maybe four or five more times

545
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:37,376
until we reached total and
complete understanding.

546
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:43,811
But together we'd walk a hundred miles,

547
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:47,696
tearing up our shoes,
looking for that icon

548
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:50,846
to pull us away from our own mortality.

549
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:57,646
Every once in a while, we find it,

550
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:03,236
for a moment.

551
00:36:03,236 --> 00:36:07,466
(pensive music)

552
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:52,326
(pensive music)
