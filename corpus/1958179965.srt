I've seen the best of the best,

25
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,000
but I have never seen anything
like this young man here.

26
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,333
[presenter 1] Remarkable.

27
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,750
Prem Patel of Jersey City
has dominated this contest

28
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,333
- since the very first equation.
- [presenter 2] Absolutely.

29
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:06,666
Twelve years old, 75 pounds, 5'1",
the kid bleeds numbers.

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,750

on everyone's mind here today is,

31
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,791
"Can this youngster win it all?"

32
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,250

heading into this final.

with the best score in history.

What is your secret?

Remember, Prem, math is for losers.

[Mr. Oh] Oh, wow. He's right.

77

- No, listen.

00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,166
[teacher] Welcome, scholars,
to 11th-grade mathematics!

168
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,250
Whoo-hoo!

169
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,416
Who's ready to get mathinated?

170
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,750
[chuckling]

171
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,958
Yes!

172
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,208
Questions?

173
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,833
No? No questions.

174
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,041
So… [clears throat] …I'm so excited.

175
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,750
This year we have some 12-year-olds
joining our high school class.

176
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,583
We have Prim Patel. Did I say that right?

177
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,583
It's, uh, Prem, like name.

178
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,500
- Prim.
- Prem.

179
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,458
- Preem.
- Prem.

180
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,750
- Praheem.
- Prem.

181
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,166
- Prahahaha.
- Perfect.

182
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,375
Okeydokey. And we have Claire Beauséjour.

183
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,583
You two are the only junior high students
who passed the entrance exam.

184
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,208
You must be quite the dynamic duo.

185
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,875
- Affirmative.
- Yep.

186
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,375
[Ms. Sage]
Well, who knows what time it is?

187
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,250
It's time for our first math quiz!

188
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,333
[chuckles]

189
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,666
Oh, and listen, for those of you
who are worried about grades,

190
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,041
I make a deal with all of my classes.

191
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,833
Does anyone from last year remember?

192
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:37,958
Anyone?

193
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,541
You know, my deal that I make?

194
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,250
[grunts] Mercedes?

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,291
If the Mathlympics team
finishes in the top three,

196
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,250
everyone on it gets an automatic A.

197
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,416
That's right.
It was so much fun last year, by the way.

198
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,220
- Ma'am, we got destroyed. Like, dead last.
- Winning isn't everything.

199
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,750
Unless you need that A, right?
You literally just said...

200
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,625
This is our year,
because we're hosting the event.

201
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,708
I rented a disco ball! [chuckles]

202
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,333
Dope. Do we still get to eat
at Olive Garden after we lose?

203
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:09,083
Uh, well, this year… [chuckles] …um,
our budget includes Taco Bell.

204
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,250
- Is that as punishment?
- No, no. Now, no.

205
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,083
You don't have to write this down.

206
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:18,291
Okay. On your marks, get set, solve!

207
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,750
[school bell rings]

208
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,833
All righty. Oh!

209
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,791
Okay, everybody,
for your first homework assignment,

210
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:01,333
what I want you to do is write an equation
with you as the solution. Okay?

211
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,458
And then you work backwards
to show how all the elements of your life

212
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,541
make up who you are.

213
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,000
It's gonna be so much fun. So, really,
have a lot of fun with it. Okay?

214
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,750
And you might even surprise yourself.

215
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,833
All righty.

nothing but a number.

They need one more in their dance crew
for the Fall Talent Show.

out there, I might like it.

- [Sharn] J-Doggy Dog! Come here!

what happened at work today.

Ronda was measuring a diuretic
for a patient,

295
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,708
and she was using deciliters
instead of cubic centimeters.

296
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,250
I was like,
"Honey, he's gonna pee forever."

Ronda, more like Wrongda. [chuckles]

Mmm. So, how'd you do in math today?

300
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,583
It was good. We had a quiz.

- [mother] And?
- I was the only one who finished.

Sorry.

309
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,708

So, what do you need for your homework?

314
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,791
- What was he known for?
- Known for?

315
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,000
- I mean, was he smart?
- Definitely, but he wasn't a math guy.

316
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,250
- What kind of guy was he?
- [sighs] There it is.

funny, confident, handsome.

320
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,000
- He was like you. Everyone loved him.
- Doesn't sound like me at all.

321
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,166
I'm sorry.
I don't really know how to help.

322
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,083

It's the club where we met.

327
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,666
- Like a dance club?
- A hip-hop club.

328
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,458

"The world's best never rest"?

331

Mom, that is so cool.

332

Was he good?

333

He was…

334
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,208
one of the best I've ever seen.

335
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,958
I wish you could've seen him.

00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:38,333
Sometimes I forget how he looked
and how he sounded.

337
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,541
Okay. [chuckles]

338
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:51,541
So, when I was in nursing school,
we used to go dancing on the weekends.

339
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,708
My girlfriends told me about this place.
It was poppin'.

340
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,958
[mother] <i>And the Leopard Lounge had</i>
<i>this thing called Freestyle Tuesdays.</i>

341
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,434
You said you only went on weekends.

342
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,541
Well, some Tuesdays. Not if we had exams.

343
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,250
I don't need to explain myself.

344
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,791
Anyway, you were at the club.

345
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,333
We were at the club,
and my girlfriends were saying…

346
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,791
This emcee's an underground legend.

347
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,750
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Blah, blah.

348
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,313
- Blah, blah. [chuckles]
- Why are they…

349
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,583
I wasn't really listening.

350
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,083
- Blah, blah, blah.
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.

351
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,708
I had a lot on my mind, like school...

352
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,958
Priya, stop thinking about Doug. Okay?

353
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,958
It's over. He's not even that cute.

354
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,375
Who's Doug?

355
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,458
Who? I don't know.
I can't really remember...

356
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,666
Good thing we stopped you
from getting that tattoo of his name, huh?

357
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,666
We literally saved your butt.

358
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,708
[friend 1] Hey, girl.
We'll go grab our drinks.

359
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,291
So, we get in, and we're waiting
for the show to start when...

360
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,708
[person] Excuse me.

361
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,583
["My Heart Will Go On" playing]

362
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,583
I don't have a line.
I just wanted to meet you.

363
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,250
My name's Suresh.

364
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,208
- I'm not interested.
- [song stops]

365
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,583
- Okay. [chuckles]
- That's what you said to Dad?

366
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,375
I didn't feel like being hit on.

367
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,291
- Would you like to have a drink?
- No.

368
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,708
I don't drink anything ever.

369
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,751
- Then why are you in a nightclub?
- Thank you. Bye.

370
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,333
I wanna walk away. I really do.

371
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,708
- Please do.
- Yes. You've set a clear boundary.

372
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,583
The only problem is
you're the prettiest girl in the room.

373
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,958
- Oh?
- And I just have this thing inside of me

374
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,833
that also tells me that
you're the smartest.

375
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,125
Like you probably got a...
What, 1550 on the SATs?

376
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,208
[scoffs] Excuse me?

377
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,708
- 1600, see?
- Thank you.

378
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,333
- I went low so that I...
- How did you know I was smart?

379
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:52,000
I could tell from your footwear,
'cause it's very sensible for a nightclub.

380
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,666
- Also, if it gets cold…
- [Priya] Uh-huh.

381
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,333
…you've got the turtleneck motif.

382
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,791
- It's mesh.
- Mm-hmm.

383
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,416
Mom, don't shut him down.
You need to make a baby.

384
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,250
Listen, I got a thing to do, but if you
change your mind about that drink...

385
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,541
- Don't hold your breath.
- You remind me of my mother.

386
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,750
I love you. Goodbye.

387
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,666
So cold.

388
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, yeah,
'cause you know he's your dad now.

389
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,958
For all I knew back then,
he could've been a psycho axe murderer.

390
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,208
So dark.

391
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,958
It happened.
2000s were a very dangerous time.

392
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,934
- [crowd cheering]
- [deejay] Ladies and gentlemen,

393
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:24,708
please welcome to the stage
the World's Best Emcee.

394
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,083
- Let's make some noise.
- [crowd] Whoo!

395
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,916
It's him. It's the legendary emcee.

396
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,041
He's gonna use his music
to melt your cold heart.

397
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,500
- [phone ringing]
- Hmm?

398
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,833
No, wait. What are you doing?

399
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,791
Don't you answer that.

400
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,458
No, Mom. Mom!

401
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,750
- [Doug] <i>…what to do, but you were gone.</i>
- Doug, listen.

402
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,833
<i>You're so checked out.</i>

403
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,458
I can't believe you missed the show.

404
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,875
- I can't believe you're so judgy.
- <i>Are you listening to me?</i>

405
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,541
Doug, I'm sorry. I think I just
fell in love with the idea of you.

406
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,750
But you have no culture, Doug.

407
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,500

408
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,708

on Destiny's Child.

My friends had a blast,
but my night was a bust.

413
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,666
Tell me about it.

414
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,500
I am. And this is the best part.

00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,000
I need you to take me
to the Leopard Lounge.

1153
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,083
It's Freestyle Tuesday.

1154
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:28,750
- You have the rehearsal after school.
- Mom made me quit the show.

1155
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:29,833
- Come on.
- Why?

1156
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:33,000
She thinks I'm a phony rapper.
That this is all just a fantasy.

1157
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:34,416
But that place is real.

1158
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,125

1159

I'd like to speak with the manager
about performing here tonight.

[bartender laughs] What are you? Nine?

1227
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,041
It's an all-ages venue.

1228
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,333
My name's Prem Patel.

1229
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:08,916
Dope.

1230
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:12,000
Well, the sign-up sheet is right here.

1231

My father used to perform here.

1235
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,500
He was an emcee.

1236
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:22,958
- Maybe you saw him?
- A lot of people perform here, kid.

1237
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:24,416
But he was an underground legend.

1238
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,583
The best rapper in the city,
maybe even the whole world.

1239
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,791
Sick. Can he do a set here tonight?

1240
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:32,208
No, he can't.

1241
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,083
- [sighs]
- Wait.

1242
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,375
You're Suresh's kid, aren't you?

1243
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,958
Man, Suresh.

1244
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,833
[laughs] Nobody did it better.

1245
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:45,083
So he really was here.

1246
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:47,583
[chuckles] Yeah, he was here all the time.

1247
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:49,208
Man never knew how to shut up.

1248
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:50,771
- [all chuckle]
- That's definitely him.

1249
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,083
Yeah? [chuckles]

1250
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,125
I heard that he…

1251
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:57,791
I'm sorry.

1252
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:01,916
Hey. I-I have a picture of him down there.
You wanna see it?

1253
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yeah.

1254
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,458
[bartender sighs] Yeah.

1255
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,708
What's this?

1256
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:12,000
[bartender]
That's your dad doing his thing.

1257
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,333
But he was an emcee.

1258
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,083
Oh, I know. [chuckles]

1259
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,208
We worked together for five years.

1260
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:20,541
He talked a better game than anyone.

1261
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:23,250
And his favorite thing
to talk about was hip-hop.

1262
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,791
[Suresh] Nas had Primo. Pac had Dre.

1263
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,958
Biggie made "Juicy Fruit" a hit.

1264
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,375
Treach, Krayzie Bone, Slick Rick.

1265
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:33,208
Don't sleep on the West Coast cats
like Gift of Gab.

1266
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,791
Hey. What about Fred Durst? He can spit.

1267
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:37,625
What?

1268
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,958
Eddie, that sentence
is not gonna age well.

1269
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:41,541
Listen, I'm the expert, okay?

1270
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:44,708
And I'll tell you all, I'm gonna be
at the top of the list one day.

1271
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:46,750
Yo, Skee-Lo. One more.

1272
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:47,833
I've been waiting.

1273
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:50,500
Fine, but only because I'm scared of you.

1274
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:52,541
Dad?

1275
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,041
Suresh had big dreams.

1276
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,392
The way he talked about it,
it was like he was his own hype man.

1277
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:57,708
All right, grumpy. Here you go.

1278
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,541
This one's on me because I made you wait.

1279
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,625
But just so you know,

1280
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:04,291
the man pouring you your drink right now
is gonna be a world-famous rapper.

1281
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,375
[scoffs] Okay.

1282
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:06,458
Oh, you laugh.

1283
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:08,125
But I've been grinding on my rhymes.

1284
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:10,250
I will be doing shows.
I'm gonna do features.

1285
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:11,541
I'll put out a album.

1286
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:15,208
And everything in this book will make me
the World's Best Emcee. Okay?

1287
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,291
You heard it here first.

1288
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,375
Hey, Corey.

1289
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:19,375
Make your next move your best move, huh?

1290
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:22,000
- Put me on tonight.
- I can't do it. I need you back here.

1291
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:24,625
- We have that bachelor party later.
- [sighs]

1292
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,583
[Corey] I should've put him on too.

1293
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:29,625
I mean, I would see him at open mics
after work with the fellas.

1294
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:31,541
- He had skills.
- But what happened?

1295
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:33,250
[Corey] Well, nothing happened.

1296
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:36,458
One day he quit, and I heard he moved
to Jersey and settled down, you know?

1297
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:37,458
Typical story.

1298
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:38,791
[glass shattering]

1299
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:41,250
- Yo, Suresh. Can you get that for me?
- Yes, sir. One second.

1300
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,875
- I'm leaking genius over here.
- [sighs]

1301
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:44,916
Come on, brother. Now, please.

1302
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,541
[chuckles]

1303
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:48,791
The world's best never rest. Am I right?

1304
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:49,875
[laughs]

1305
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:52,583
[Suresh] Okay.

1306
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,083
Oh, right.

1307
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:57,000
Give the man a free drink
and he drops it on the ground.

1308
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,750
Well done. I got it. I got it.

1309
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,083
You're not getting another one.

1310
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:04,000
Hey, Corey. We need a smaller broom.

1311
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,541
I'm gonna get carpal tunnels.

1312
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:14,958
[Gabe] What does that dude even know
about rap anyways?

1313
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:16,833
- He's just some bartender.
