00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,033

would prove to Turaga Dume...

that we are worthy Toa.

184
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,533
So, we go on
a scavenger hunt...

185
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,433

stood too long...

186
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,000
in front of his forge?

187
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:33,067
Visions can be
a sign of madness, yes.

188
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,833
Or messages
from the Great Spirit.

189
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,967

afford to ignore them.

-Yeah.

191

00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,700
And check out these wings.

363
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:50,933
Whoo! Ha ha ha.

364
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,433
Hmm...

365
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,033
One of these Great Disks
has got to be the Mask of Time.

366
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,700
Ohh?

367
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:06,833
Huh.

368
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,067
Remarkable.

369
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:28,967
Vakama? Come on.

370
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:30,433
What? Just a moment.

371
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:31,733
Vakama, we've got to go.

372
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:32,833
But the disks--

373
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,033
Look!

374
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>Toa Lhikan's spirit star:</i>

375
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,367
<i>Each Toa has one:</i>

376
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,500
<i>As long as it burns
in the night sky,</i>

377
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,367
Toa Lhikan remains alive.

378
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:45,433
lt is headed toward Po-Metru.

379
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:47,700
What about our captured
Toa brothers?

380
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:50,967
We need Toa Lhikan
to stop Turaga Dume...

381
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,533
and free the other Toa.

382
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,467
And how do You propose
we quick-catch a spirit star?

383
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,567
Penaps a way has been
revealed, rider.

384
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,067
Vakama!

385
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,400
What are these?

386
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:25,767
Storage containers...

387
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,333
but most odd-looking.

388
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:54,300
<i>MAKUTA: Vakama:</i>

389
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:58,867
The Matoran!
They're in danger!

390
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,533
<i>NOKAMA: What do You see?</i>

391
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,500
Nothing, sister.
Nothing at all.

392
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,333
Eh, cross-wired!

393
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,200
Turaga, l know You not.

394
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:16,667
your concerns should be with
your own identity, not mine.

395
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:20,333
Freedom and escape
are different objectives...

396
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,967
but both aren't easily realized.

397
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,967
You are stuck in here
with us, so...

398
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:29,067
l have freedom, even in here.

399
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:33,233
But for escape,
Toa mask powers are needed.

400
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,800
l doubt we will ever be in touch
with our mask powers.

401
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,333
Oh, never doubt what
You are capable of.

402
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,267
The Great Spirit lives
through us all.

403
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:54,467
Vakama, your destiny no longer
lies in sculpting masks.

404
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:56,033
You are a Toa.

405
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,867
Ahh, l'll never be
a real Toa.

406
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,133
l can't even make
a decent mask.

407
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,833
l'm just a cross-wired freak
who has weird dreams.

408
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:08,000
Toa Lhikan, You got it wrong.

409
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,033
You will.

410
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,733
Have faith.

411
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,833
Ride's over.

412
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,267
-Ooh!
-uh!

413
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,500
Stick close.

414
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,767
Bad things happen
in the desert.

415
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:41,233
Oh, Matau, You don't know
what You're talking about.

416
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,433
Fine. Don't listen to me,
teacher.

417
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,600
Hello!

418
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,467
Hello, hello!

419
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:10,533
Guess they all quick-sped.

420
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,800
Builders do not abandon
their projects...

421
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,767
without good reason.

422
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,333
Then where is everyone?

423
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:20,000
-Over here, Toa!
-No! Kreka!

424
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:34,600
Aah! A Toa hero
knows no fear!

425
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,433
Unh! uh!

426
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:45,967
Help! Vakama! Nokama!

427
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:48,333
There's a Toa down!

428
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,433
Kreka: What's going on?

429
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,400
Are You doing that?

430
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:06,567
Now what?

431
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,000
Bioquake?

432
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,700
Oh! Worse.

433
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,333
Kikanalo!

434
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,433
l'm out of here! Let's go!

435
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,767
Hey! What about me?

436
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,800
Matau, hang on!

437
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,467
Follow me!

438
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,133
Hmm. No! Get down!

439
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:51,067
Aah!

440
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,467
Aah! Aah!

441
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,700
No!

442
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:56,000
You fool!

443
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:02,833
l was wrong.

444
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,600
You were right, my brother.

445
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,767
Heh. lt's amazing
what You can learn...

446
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,600
when You're not always
speak-teaching.

447
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,833
What did You say?

448
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,900
l didn't say--
Why the mask-glowing?

449
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,600
Nokama!

450
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:42,033
Whoo! Whoo hoo hoo!

451
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,733
My mask power.

452
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:51,667
The chief wants to know...

453
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:55,367
why we are allied
with the Dark Hunters.

454
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:56,833
Tell him we're not.

455
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,133
We seek a friend who's been
taken by the hunters.

456
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,933
We are...

457
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,333
free to pass...

458
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,067
since we are both against...

459
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:13,033
the hunters who trespass...

460
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,000
the beauty of the Herdlands.

461
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:18,400
Heh. Beauty. Where?

462
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:21,000
And who knew Kikanalo
could think-talk?

463
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:22,467
l just thought
they were dumb beasts.

464
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,500
Kikanalo still think the same
of tall green Matoran.

465
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:30,533
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
l'm a Toa.

466
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,767
Wait, wait. Tall Matoran.

467
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:38,167
Ask him if the Dark Hunters
trespassed with a tall Matoran.

468
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:45,667
Yes. They take many things to
the Place of Unending Whispers.

469
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:48,367
That must be where
they have Toa Lhikan.

470
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:52,167
They will show us the way.

471
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,700
Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

472
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,733
<i>Only a great Toa rider</i>

473
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,167
could tame a wild
Kikanalo beast.

474
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,967
Ooh! uh!

475
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,367
lt seems a great
Toa rider just got tamed.

476
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,633
uh!

477
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,233
Do not rely
on your memory.

478
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,000
Look beyond your history
and see what is.

479
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,000
Hey, l'm not a Rahi bat, OK?

480
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:38,800
l can see in the dark.

481
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,367
Oh!

482
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,633
Soon You'll be ready...

483
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,700
For a game of pin the tail
on the ash bear...

484
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,867
record-keeper. Ha ha ha!

485
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:51,867
Uh!

486
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,467
l could toil
at this task forever...

487
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:57,400
and still learn nothing
for the future.

488
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,067
Today You can learn...

489
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,000
that building
the tallest tower...

490
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:04,567
begins with the placement
of a single stone.

491
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,767
Build a tower?

492
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,400
A thinker would never
lay hands on stone.

493
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:12,500
They're too busy with
their heads in the stars.

494
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:16,933
A Toa's duty is to all Matoran,
regardless of village...

495
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
so You shall help
both your brothers.

496
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:25,300
<i>MATAU: Vahki--</i>

497
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:27,000
<i>hundreds of them.</i>

498
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:29,500
NOKAMA: That must be
where Toa Lhikan is.

499
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,433
What should we do?

500
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:32,900
How do we get in there?

501
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,167
l have a plan.

502
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,600
Oh!

503
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,967
uh!

504
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:52,900
That was a complete
waste of time!

505
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:54,600
Without self-discovery...

506
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:57,467
You will never find
your destiny.

507
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:59,633
This is every Toa's duty...

508
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,433
to the Great Spirit.

509
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,633
This whole thing was
a load of duty if You ask me.

510
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Sit down, Whenua.

511
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,100
Taking orders from a Turaga
was one thing...

512
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:11,933
but from an overgrown
hammer swinger--

513
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,267
Sit down.

514
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,933
-Sit down.
-Aah!

515
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
Sit down now!

516
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,233
Aah! uh!

517
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,167
Aw, that's it.

518
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,967
You're history, Builder...

519
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:26,000
even if l don't know
how You did that.

520
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,300
Stop.

521
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,333
Whoa! How'd You do that?

522
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:38,267
Huh?

523
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,567
-your mask!
-your mask!

524
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,500
-your mask is glowing.
-That's amazing.

525
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:49,367
Ahem. l believe
it is time to depart.

526
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,767
Follow me, Vahki.

527
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,733

Whoo! Whoo hoo hoo!

531
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:18,667
Yee hah hah!

532
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,433
Whoo-hoo!

533
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:02,800
Kreka, circle right.

534
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,567
Nidhiki, where'd the Toa go?

535
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:23,700
You must've let him slip-past.

536
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,533
Circle the other way-back.

537
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,167
Heh heh!

538
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:30,567
Huh?

539
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:34,733
Grr. Where did the Toa go?

540
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,667
You let him get by You?

541
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:40,567
Maybe he sneak-passed.

542
00:40:47,467 --> 00:40:49,567
Hey, uh...

543
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,433
Aah!

544
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,867
Grr! Let go! Let go!

545
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:56,867
Where's the Toa?

546
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,833
How should l know?

547
00:40:57,867 --> 00:40:59,400
l told You to go that way!

548
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,933
You told me to go the other way.

549
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,367
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Shape-shifting!

550
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,667
Some mask powers
are worth the wait.

551
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,333
Hoo hoo hoo! Yee-haw!

552
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,867
<i>MATAU:
Yah! Ha ha ha!</i>

553
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,967
Whoo! Whoo hoo hoo!

554
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,467
Hey, Kikanalo,
who's your mas--

555
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,433
l mean, who's your partner?

556
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:04,967
Eww!

557
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,300
Ooh.

558
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:12,667
The chief said,
''Not bad...

559
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,567
''for flat-walkers.''

560
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,300
They will cover our herd tracks.

561
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,900
Toa Lhikan will be
forever in your debt.

562
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,433
lf they seal us in,
how will we get out?

563
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,967
NOKAMA: Don't wory.
We'll find a way.

564
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:04,400
Excellent.

565
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:08,033
Dume's mask has been useful.

566
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:11,900
Now for its final task.

567
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,367
The future will be mine...

568
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:22,867
even without the Mask of Time.

569
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:27,633
ONEWA: You?
l'm the one suffering here.

570
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:30,100
All that lies ahead is shadow.

571
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:33,367
Hey, it has to be better
than what's behind us.

572
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,900
Hmm!

573
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:37,800
your mask power.

574
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,267
Follow me, guuys.

575
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,133
our future just got
a whole lot brighter.

576
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:45,733
Hey, Whenua, can that mask
glow any brighter?

577
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,933
lt's already brighter
than You, brother.

578
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:50,033
l think we're going
the wrong way.

579
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,933
Relax. l know these tunnels
like the back of my hand.

580
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,267
Hold up. l heard something.

581
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,900
uh! Ooh!

582
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:00,167
Rrrah la la la la!

583
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,600
Hey, turn out
the bright light.

584
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:04,767
Matau?

585
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,233
Toa Matau...

586
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:10,767
to You, Whenua.

587
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,267
Shape-shifting?

588
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:16,600
Yeah, and You should hear Nokama
translating Kikanalo.

589
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:20,000
So, we've all discovered
our mask powers.

590
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:22,133
Everyone but me.

591
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,867
How did You know
we would be here?

592
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:28,767
We didn't.
We came for Toa Lhikan.

593
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:29,900
He's not here.

594
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,433
<i>Well</i>

595
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,733
Heh heh heh. Not exactly.

596
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:37,900
Toa Lhikan?

597
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:39,600
No, Vakama.

598
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:44,867
You are Toa.
l am Turaga Lhikan.

599
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,433
Oh.

600
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,767
Uh, but why didn't You
tell us who You were?

601
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,767
your task was to discover
who You are.

602
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,700
Only with such knowledge...

603
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:57,433
would your powers
reveal themselves.

604
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,267
Quick-stop.
Where did your power go?

605
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,467
lt lives on in all of You.

606
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:04,567
Tell me--

607
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:06,900
the heart of Metru Nui--

608
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:08,100
You have it safe?

609
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:11,833
Well, we're rescuing You now.

610
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,900
You are so misGuided.

611
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:17,333
l am not Metru Nui's heart.

612
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,367
The Matoran are.

613
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:24,933
Then l failed You.

614
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,333
l told You.
l'm a cross-wired freak...

615
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,067
chasing my dreams,
wasting everyone's time.

616
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:33,033
l'll never be a real Toa.

617
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,667
-Vakama--
-Wait.

618
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,367
We cannot help Vakama.

619
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:42,333
He must learn
to believe in himself.

620
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,800
Only then will
he find his destiny.

621
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:55,000
Aah!

622
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:56,700
Turaga Dume?

623
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:59,433
The true Turaga Dume.

624
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:01,100
As l feared...

625
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:03,967
<i>an imposter
is posing as a mask</i>

626
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,433
<i>we all trust.</i>

627
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,133
<i>MAKUTA: Bring me</i>

628
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,967
<i>the Mask of Time.</i>

629
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,800
lf this is Turaga Dume--

630
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:15,867
You don't want to know who's
really in control of Metru Nui.

631
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,400
Vahki! Run now,
talk later! Oh!

632
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,133
ln here! Unh!

633
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:32,900
Unh!

634
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:35,233
This won't hold 'em long! Unh!

635
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,667
<i>ONEWA: We've got
to find a way out!</i>

636
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,267
But our only exit is blocked.

637
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:40,000
<i>NUJU: Now what?</i>

638
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,800
Then we make our own.

639
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:47,000
Come on!

640
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,033
What about Turaga Dume?

641
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:55,567
He'll be safe until we return.

642
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,800
Now go!

643
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,100

644
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,467

to protect the Matoran!

664

We can't take them all now.

683

kind of.

710
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,700
You no longer need

00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:46,233
Matau, stay true to the light.

726
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:50,700
Huh!

727
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,000

728
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:55,100

729
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,433
Yeah! All right!

730
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,600
Nokama, quick-turn!

731
00:55:01,633 --> 00:55:03,067

732
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,400
<i>Whoo!</i>

Hoo hoo hoo!
Ha ha ha!

734
00:55:09,433 --> 00:55:12,967
Nuju! Get me up there!

735
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:20,400
Ruh!

736
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,700

739
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:40,267
Whoa!

740
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,233
The Matoran!

741
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,700
Hmm...

742
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,300
The Mask of Time.

743
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:01,667
You are a great mask maker.

744
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:06,833
You could have many destinies.

745
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:08,500
Come.

746
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:11,433
Join my brothers...

747
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,067
<i>and me</i>

748
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:16,767
l desire just one
noble destiny...

749
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,267
more than any power
You can offer me.

750
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:25,100
Then accept your doom.

751
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,467
Lhikan!

752
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:20,467
That was meant for me.

753
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,967
No.

754
00:57:23,033 --> 00:57:27,267
This is my lifetime's journey.

755
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:31,200
yours lies beyond.

756
00:57:33,267 --> 00:57:36,467

757
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,533

758
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,800

759
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:45,433
Toa Vakama.

760
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:37,167
My mask power.

761
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,700
Ah, at last.

762
00:58:48,467 --> 00:58:50,033
Not this time.

763
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:56,200
No!

764
00:59:06,433 --> 00:59:10,200
Without the Mask of Time...

765
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:14,200
it will take
a lifetime's journey...

766
00:59:14,267 --> 00:59:19,433
to find both our destinies.

767
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:23,800
Only yours will be brief.

768
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:25,900
uh!

769
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:40,200
Come on.

773
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,933
Makuta!

774
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,233
MAKUTA:
l know where You are.

775
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:04,933
This way!

776
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,867
Show yourself.

777
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:31,567
Makuta!

778
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,933
Giving up so soon?

779
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:45,367
You cannot hide from me.

780
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,733
l don't need to. l'm a Toa.

781

No!

782
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,833
lf Toa Lhikan...

783
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,800
could not defeat me alone...

784
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:34,900
how could You?

785
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:37,733
Because he's not alone.

786
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:38,667
You tell him, sister.

787
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,633
That's right.

788
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:40,967

-Whoo-hoo!

797
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:18,433
Toa Lhikan sacrificed
his power for us.

798
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,800
Now we shall do
the same for them.

799
01:04:40,967 --> 01:04:42,867
Vakama?

800
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,900
