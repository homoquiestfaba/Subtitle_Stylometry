1
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:26,416
All I wanted,
all I ever wanted

2
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,545
was for my husband to love me.

3
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:34,758
That wasn't meant to be

4
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,968
because that's not
how we've made the world.

5
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,264
No, that isn't...

6
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,100
No, he promised...

7
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,644
Yeah, typical.

8
00:00:46,688 --> 00:00:48,189
Yeah.

9
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:53,860
- Everything okay?
- I'm late.

10
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:57,364
Oh, a guy from the insurance
company is gonna come by today

11
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,532
with some papers
for you to cosign.

12
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,284
Oh, we don't
already have insurance?

13
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,497
Of course, but Ron wants us
to update our policy.

14
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,250
Sent a emissary by the office
the other day,

15
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:10,586
new kid,

16
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,006
had all the ladies swooning.

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,467
Sounds like you'll love him.

18
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,094
What does that mean?

19
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:20,513
He's good-looking, that's all.

20
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,780
Ooh, I got us
a tri-tip for dinner.

21
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:40,116
Oh, my favorite.

22
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,577
But I'm supposed to meet
Councilman Peck tonight.

23
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:45,204
- Oh.
- I'll call you.

24
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:47,332
I love you, Ste.

25
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:52,169
Why'd you say that?

26
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,879
'Cause I love you?

27
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,097
If you get yourself
knocked up,

28
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:03,722
that's all gonna change.

29
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,016
Yeah, I... I appreciate
what you're saying, Mama,

30
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:09,229
but it's... it's not as easy
as that, okay?

31
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:11,773
Can we just... can we just talk
about something else?

32
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:14,651
Uh, there's a new dollar
machine down at the casino.

33
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,215
If you win a free spin,
the horses run.

34
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:25,496
Okay. Okay, Mama.

35
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,998
Mama, I... I got to hang up now.

36
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,001
I... I got to go.
I love you too.

37
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:39,217
Mrs. Stevens?

38
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,640
Jake Walters, Vertex Insurance.

39
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:46,516
If you prefer,
I can come back later,

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,477
or you could go up and change.

41
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:52,064
No, uh, oh, this is only
gonna take a minute, right?

42
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:53,816
Right.

43
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,569
Would you mind if...

44
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,405
Could I have a glass of water?

45
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,949
Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah.

46
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:14,879
- Ah, thank you.
- Sure.

47
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,858
So what do we do here?

48
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:36,234
Since the insurance is held

49
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,027
in your trust,
you need to cosign.

50
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:40,697
- What kind of insurance?
- Life.

51
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,033
It's been increased
to $15 million.

52
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:46,328
- For my husband?
- For both of you.

53
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,456
Stunning view.

54
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:57,547
Can we?
If anything happened to him,

55
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,675
he wanted you
to be provided for,

56
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:04,805
and God forbid, well,
he asked me not to say this,

57
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:07,641
but if anything happened
to you, it would destroy him.

58
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:09,059
He wouldn't be able to work.

59
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:12,312
- He said that?
- Mm.

60
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:14,982
How sweet of him.

61
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:18,235
So where do I sign?

62
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,653
Uh, well, actually,

63
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,321
there's a bit more to it
than just that.

64
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:24,241
You need to check
your medical history here.

65
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,285
Oh.

66
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,914
Okay.

67
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:41,426
So, uh, why is the
insurance in our trust?

68
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:44,721
I don't know.
It's what rich people do.

69
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:47,181
They're either flashing it
or hiding it.

70
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:50,225
Some lifestyles are expensive,
not that I would know.

71
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,145
Both:

72
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:55,940
Oh.

73
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:08,369
Your name is Sue Anne
but people call you Brooke?

74
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:11,331
- Long, boring story.
- I'd love to hear it.

75
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,835
May I say this?

76
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:21,967
You have
a very compelling quality.

77
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,220
Do I?

78
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:32,602
This is a...

79
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:35,773
This is a very
unusual insurance meeting.

80
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:38,233
Yes.

81
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:40,986
May I ask another question?

82
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:45,491
I don't see how to
stop you at this point.

83
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:48,701
Does your husband know?

84
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:51,872
That you're not
completely happy?

85
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:58,796
Ah, right. Mm.

86
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,095
Um, why... why would I
answer that?

87
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:08,097
Even... even if that were...

88
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,369
The next step,
you and your husband

89
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:10,891
will need to get physicals,

90
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,643
and I'll generate
the final docs.

91
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,311
Uh, and then you'll have

92
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,272
to come back for me
to sign the papers?

93
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,689
No, no need
to bother you again.

94
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,566
We can do it all electronically.

95
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:31,078
I see it a lot.

96
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:33,415
Couples, they start taking
each other for granted,

97
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,708
and obviously you're
a very gorgeous woman,

98
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:39,128
but sometimes people
stop communicating

99
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:42,966
in an intimate way,
you know, talking and so on.

100
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,384
I don't know you.

101
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:46,177
That's right.

102
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,638
You shouldn't be talking
to me like this.

103
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:51,224
You're right.

104
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:54,060
I shouldn't.

105
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:56,104
It's perfectly safe.

106
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,649
We'll never see
each other again, and I find,

107
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:01,401
don't you, it's much easier
talking to a stranger?

108
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,287
What you're selling,
the insurance, what does it do?

109
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:16,291
Nothing.
Nothing can ward off despair,

110
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,252
but insurance
does provide financial

111
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:21,504
and emotional protection
against the unthinkable.

112
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,382
Of course, once
you've thought it,

113
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:25,341
it's not unthinkable anymore.

114
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:28,219
- Good morning, Mrs. Stevens.
- Oh, good morning, Carlita.

115
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:34,351
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Pleasure meeting you too.

116
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:45,362
You're a remarkable person,
Brooke.

117
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,780
You need to accept
that and decide

118
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,491
what you want from your life.

119
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:02,922
Wow, that was so cool.
Let's ride it again!

120
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,591
No, no, we're going
to the arcade.

121
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,760
- Yay!
- Yay.

122
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:09,221
Oh, Jessie is so cute.

123
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:11,348
She's making your ovaries
hurt, isn't she?

124
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,225
That obvious?

125
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:16,728
We've... we've stopped
trying for now, I guess.

126
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,855
Stopped trying to get
pregnant or stopped screwing?

127
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,524
Well, one does
cause the other.

128
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,608
Oh, it's nothing a good
BJ can't fix.

129
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,485
That's Tara's solution
to everything.

130
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,257
Yeah, I'm sure the night
you conceived started

131
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,156
with one of those.

132
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,261
No, that night started off
with one too many martinis.

133
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:34,287
Sexy underwear, communication,
and BJs are the key

134
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,957
to a happy marriage.
Not in that order.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,501
Okay, I'm gonna start
with the sexy underwear.

136
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:42,587
You need to find a young man
to get the job done.

137
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:45,006
I could never do that to him.

138
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,675
Sparking life back
into unused parts

139
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:48,594
is the best thing
you can do for a marriage.

140
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,720
And Tara knows
what she's talking about.

141
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,598
Mm-hmm.

142
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:54,850
That's right, I totally
forgot about that night

143
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:56,602
with your Italian model.

144
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:59,396
Nights, plural,
and I regretted it.

145
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,648
Oh, you did not.

146
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:04,234
You spoke about those orgasms
for weeks.

147
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,111
Maybe we should all
get divorced,

148
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:08,863
pool our money,
and run off to Capri.

149
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:10,740
Mm-mm, that would not be
fair to you guys.

150
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,367
I'd get zip in a divorce.

151
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:13,931
- You signed a prenup?
- I didn't have to.

152
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:15,580
Ste doesn't actually
own anything.

153
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,873
It's all tied up
in his family's trust.

154
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,916
I thought you were rich.
Thank God

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,710
I don't have to envy you
anymore.

156
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,920
Money makes everything
so much more complicated.

157
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:25,923
Being poor sucks.

158
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,717
Well, I could certainly use

159
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,969
a little less complication
in my life.

160
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,941
This is the weirdest upsell
I've ever seen.

161
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:46,193
I offered to buy you a drink,

162
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,945
and you want
to sell me insurance?

163
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:50,740
Bad things happen.
You got to protect your kid.

164
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:52,617
How do you even know
if I have a kid?

165
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,121
I read people.

166
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,710
Oh, that's bullshit.
All right, I'll prove it.

167
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:08,884
You were married, young,
to a woman, one kid.

168
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:12,846
Lasted a few years, she had
no idea your wandering eye

169
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,682
was for the mechanic
that serviced your car.

170
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,059
Two old-fashioneds, please.

171
00:10:17,102 --> 00:10:19,436
What... what are you,
clairvoyant?

172
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,732
Your dad,

173
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:26,902
he died before you came out,
didn't he?

174
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:30,405
And you came out, what, like,
three, four years ago?

175
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:36,036
You been talking
to my ex-wife?

176
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:41,333
Just give me a sec.

177
00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:43,794
Ah.

178
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:50,801
You know, you're cruel.

179
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:55,931
Effective and profitable.

180
00:10:57,935 --> 00:10:59,310
That's what credit
cards are for.

181
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,046
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,507
You hit a nerve.

183
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:32,468
You had my dad pegged,
all right.

184
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:36,097
I was an idiot
not to tell him who I am.

185
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,398
He loved you.
Parents always know.

186
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,989
Ah, um, when you, uh,
get serious about insurance...

187
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:59,455
Want to get out of here?

188
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,464
Hey.

189
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,468
There's another
three policies.

190
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,012
Oh, you're amazing.

191
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,766
These guys,
they have art collections.

192
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,143
They have wine collections,
real estate holdings.

193
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:22,895
They're supporting
elderly parents.

194
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:24,583
Someone needs to be
protecting their interests.

195
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:26,273
And they want to hook up.

196
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:32,613
Wong, who knew you were
so small-minded?

197
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:36,136
Since these guys got the shaft
from the insurance industry

198
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,951
during the '80s,

199
00:12:37,995 --> 00:12:40,913
they trust us just about
as far as they can throw us.

200
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:43,248
I'm just non-judgmental.
I remind them

201
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:46,377
that they share the same risks
as everyone else.

202
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,711
Just not sure that your father

203
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:49,296
would approve of your methods.

204
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,424
Let's just say dad
was old-school.

205
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:53,218
I'm more reform school.

206
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:55,345
Okay, well, be careful.
There's a fine line.

207
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,138
Remember,
you are not invincible.

208
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,099
Oh, my God, I'm not?

209
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:22,622
Mrs. Stevens.

210
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,082
Oh, hi.

211
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,459
- Wow.
- What are you doing here?

212
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:28,711
Nice to see you again.

213
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:31,339
You look...

214
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:33,341
Good thing I bumped into you
'cause, uh,

215
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:35,677
I have your policy,
and I was gonna, like I said,

216
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,554
email it to you,
but I'm old school.

217
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:40,099
With a big policy like this
I prefer getting a real check,

218
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:42,434
real papers.

219
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,312
Would you mind
if I dropped by again or...

220
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:47,606
- Yeah, sure.
- Excellent.

221
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,234
Then it's a date... uh,
an appointment.

222
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:14,842
Hey.

223
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,638
Hate to do this to you.

224
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:21,432
What?

225
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:24,686
Last-minute trip with
some buyers to New Orleans.

226
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,522
It's a backup plan
if the rezoning falls through.

227
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,194
I'll be back tomorrow night.

228
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,405
I made you snickerdoodles.
You want one?

229
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,408
And add an extra
hour onto the treadmill?

230
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,118
Yeah, no thanks.

231
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,793
I don't know if it'd be fun
hanging out on Bourbon Street,

232
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:51,880
but you don't want to go?

233
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:02,223
Uh, yeah, I would...
I'd love to,

234
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:03,850
but, uh,
real estate exam's coming up.

235
00:15:03,894 --> 00:15:05,560
Yeah.

236
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,229
- I should study.
- Yup, no, that's good.

237
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,025
Oh, don't forget we have
that charity thing on Sunday.

238
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:12,567
I won't.

239
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,319
Councilman Peck is
supposed to be there.

240
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:17,907
I want you to look great.
I'm gonna go pack.

241
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,995
"Oh, no, no,
thank you, sweetheart.

242
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,916
"It... it was so nice of you
to bake them for me though."

243
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:56,487
Hi.

244
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,155
Hey.

245
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,324
Wow, you look stunning.

246
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:02,785
Thank you.

247
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,330
Well, the truth is you don't
have to wear anything.

248
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,335
Anything special, I mean.

249
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:14,547
You're always breathtaking.

250
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,801
I mean, literally, when I look
at you I forget to breathe.

251
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:26,184
You're smooth.
We're drinking?

252
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:29,062
We're celebrating.

253
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:31,647
Veuve Clicquot?

254
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,109
Kind of a hip place
for an insurance meeting, no?

255
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:37,529
Yeah, I lied.

256
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:39,990
I thought it would be more
adventuresome to meet here.

257
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:47,163
We work so hard, don't we?

258
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,125
To be in control.

259
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,794
To do what we're supposed to do.

260
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:55,172
But we can't, and we're not.

261
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:02,054
How would you feel
if Stevens died?

262
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:03,472
I'm... I'm sorry.

263
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,348
What?

264
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,225
It's a natural question
with life insurance.

265
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,686
Most married folks have

266
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,314
a wish disguised as a fear.

267
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:14,024
Their spouse
is in a car accident

268
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:16,276
or has a heart attack
or something like that.

269
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,531
Yeah, Ste's death
would... would be a disaster.

270
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:24,117
My... my life would be over.

271
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,994
No.

272
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:29,165
This life would be over,
but yours would start again.

273
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:33,418
Things happen, Brooke.

274
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:36,089
Things that we don't anticipate,

275
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:39,257
and if we're alive,
if we're still alive,

276
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:41,928
then we have to be open
to those things.

277
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,933
I think that there's
someone else in there.

278
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:51,062
In you.

279
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,147
Someone that you don't
let out very often.

280
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:58,194
Someone who's
a little dangerous,

281
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:01,405
someone who wants
very much to be alive.

282
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:10,290
That's why I had
to see you again.

283
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:14,253
In fact, I...

284
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:16,254
I can't remember
when I wanted something

285
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:18,382
quite so much.

286
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:24,345
I've rented a room.

287
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:27,974
- I lo... I love my husband.
- Of course you do.

288
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:31,228
When we were first married,
we would go...

289
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:33,062
We'd go on getaway weekends,

290
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:36,108
and we'd go hiking together,
and he was so doting...

291
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:39,236
- Do you want to go upstairs?
- I can't.

292
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,948
I... you should not... you
should not be asking me that.

293
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:46,410
That's not what I asked you.

294
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:14,646
Have you seen my iPad?

295
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,064
Uh, check my nightstand.

296
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,443
Carlita.

297
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:21,988
Oh.

298
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,075
Pepper spray?

299
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,039
What's this?

300
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,664
For protection.

301
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:35,210
From me?

302
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,420
No.

303
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:39,714
What's-her-name,

304
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:42,217
purple slacks, three doors down,

305
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,094
intruder broke in,
tried to rape her daughter.

306
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:47,305
Well, if you're
that concerned,

307
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:49,182
I'll get you a gun.

308
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:54,020
I'll sleep on it.

309
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,722
You know, you said something
the other night in your sleep.

310
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,826
- I was dreaming?
- Maybe.

311
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:10,245
You said,

312
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:13,582
"Of course I love you,
but I also hate your guts."

313
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:19,672
That's funny?

314
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:22,675
It's funny 'cause you think
I was talking about you.

315
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:25,802
I was probably talking
about my mom.

316
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:28,555
Yeah.

317
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,808
Of course.

318
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:33,935
Silly of me.

319
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:39,024
But is there something
you want to tell me?

320
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:45,072
Anything buried deep
in your subconscious mind

321
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:47,074
that you're just
dying to get out?

322
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,083
Oh, hey, did the insurance
thing get taken care of?

323
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:59,044
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

324
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:15,437
Ste, I want you to touch me.

325
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:24,529
Hey.

326
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:26,948
I want you to touch me.

327
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,998
Hey, you know
that charity ball

328
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,540
you're going to tonight
at the museum?

329
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:18,585
Mm-hmm.

330
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:20,418
Wong gave me two tickets

331
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,630
for employee of the month,

332
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:26,342
so I'll see you with Stevens.

333
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,511
Oh, God.
That'll be awkward.

334
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:30,805
Maybe we'll disappear
for five minutes.

335
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,058
Jake, no, don't joke.

336
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,642
If he caught us,
he would kill us.

337
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:36,310
- Maybe.
- You met him.

338
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,480
He's old-school macho,
territorial.

339
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,940
Well, it's gorgeous territory.

340
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:42,775
So you say.

341
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,737
You know, the point is he,
uh... he thinks he owns it.

342
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:49,031
- Doesn't he?
- Not anymore.

343
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,913
Hey, you, uh... you
remember the hotel?

344
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,834
Of course I do, vividly.

345
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,711
You said something,

346
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,089
almost as if you were implying

347
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,466
that Ste should have
an accident.

348
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,635
No, just that...
That it'd be natural

349
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,929
to have that kind of fantasy.
Mm.

350
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:19,229
Well, if you're
speaking of fantasy.

351
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,730
Well, three's my lucky number.

352
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,816
Yeah?

353
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,886
Councilman Peck at 3:00.

354
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,607
Between Angie's Louboutins,

355
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,526
private schools,
office overhead, I'm drowning.

356
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,738
Mayday.
Hey, Brooke, looking fancy.

357
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:15,328
If I disappeared, nobody
would care except you and Tara.

358
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,288
That's not... Buck would care.

359
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,415
Care?
He wouldn't even notice.

360
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,671
"Sure is sleeping a lot.
Maybe she's depressed."

361
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,635
Brooke, what I really want
to talk about

362
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,887
is a certain someone
who was sighted

363
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:36,183
at the No-Tell bar
with a handsome stranger.

364
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:38,976
- Dish, Brookie.
- I don't know what you mean.

365
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,854
- Brooke.
- I was signing papers.

366
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,065
Brooke, you're not.

367
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,234
No, it's... it is not
what you think.

368
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,320
- Mm-hmm.
- No judging here.

369
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:51,823
We're your friends, and we know
how unhappy you've been.

370
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,034
I think it's great.
Get some while you can.

371
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,163
Brooke, are you okay?

372
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,309
Brooke, I don't mean
to freak you out,

373
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,375
but Ste is walking this way.

374
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,796
- Ladies.
- Hi, Ste.

375
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,800
Ste, I'm sorry, but this is
a ladies only conversation.

376
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,345
The mysteries I could learn
from that.

377
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:14,596
Both:

378
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,973
But unfortunately,

379
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,809
I'm going to have to
steal my wife.

380
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,732
Oh, uh, how'd it go
with the councilman?

381
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,526
- The prick is avoiding me.
- Mm.

382
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,239
- I might need your help later.
- Mm.

383
00:25:31,283 --> 00:25:34,324
It's a disaster since
Mom learned how to text.

384
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,077
- There's Wong.
- Oh.

385
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:40,290
Ste, good to see you.
Looking good.

386
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,166
Thank you.
You better hope so.

387
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,628
You got 15 mil riding on it.

388
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:48,631
Mr. Wong, my beautiful wife.

389
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,549
Great to finally meet you,
Mrs. Stevens.

390
00:25:50,594 --> 00:25:52,051
Heard all about you from Jake.

391
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:54,345
He is such a sweet boy.

392
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:56,670
Will you excuse me though?
I need to use the ladies' room.

393
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,697
Are you waiting for someone?

394
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:14,866
Maybe.

395
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:17,201
Isn't Cinderella
waiting for you?

396
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:24,542
Ah, I forgot to ask you.

397
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,841
Are you wearing any panties?

398
00:26:30,884 --> 00:26:32,426
Excuse me?

399
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,345
Looking for a woman
who isn't wearing any.

400
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:35,762
Ah.

401
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:38,431
That must be hard to find.

402
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:41,560
The hunt is the best part.

403
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:44,104
- Are you?
- Wearing?

404
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:46,190
Mm.

405
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,858
You'll, uh... you'll have
to see for yourself.

406
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:50,819
Oh.

407
00:26:56,993 --> 00:26:59,745
Oh, my, you're not wearing any.

408
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:28,836
- Good.
- Have you ladies seen Brooke?

409
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,566
Well, maybe if you paid
more attention to her,

410
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,921
you wouldn't have to look.

411
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:35,341
She hasn't been
herself lately.

412
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:37,303
She's fine.

413
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:40,013
If you say so, but if there's
anything I can do for her,

414
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:42,223
please let me know.

415
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,559
Well, maybe it's what
you should do to her.

416
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:48,981
- Sounds good.
- Shall we?

417
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:52,066
Well, yes.

418
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:56,155
I can't... I can't stand this,
not having you.

419
00:28:57,116 --> 00:29:00,326
I need you every day,
every night, every minute.

420
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:04,663
Divorce him.
So what?

421
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,584
We'll have nothing,
but we'll have each other.

422
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,170
I came from nothing, Jake.

423
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:14,131
If I go back, I'll die.
I will wither and die.

424
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:23,390
You'll wither and die
if you stay with him.

425
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,026
Who's texting at this hour?

426
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:38,615
Mom just figured out
what emojis are.

427
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,617
Oh, God.

428
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:47,207
She's losing at the slots.
She wants to come visit.

429
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:51,253
No. Hell no.
Write her a check.

430
00:29:51,296 --> 00:29:54,297
I cannot handle a visit
from your mother right now.

431
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:56,383
No way.

432
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,844
I have to go to Miami tomorrow.

433
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,054
- Again?
- For Christ sakes,

434
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,598
it's one night.

435
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:05,141
We need this.
It's another backup deal.

436
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:08,061
That's why you went to...
To New Orleans.

437
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:10,856
God!

438
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,860
Everything we have is tied up.

439
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,657
What do you want from me?

440
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,958
If you want to talk...

441
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:32,628
There's nothing for you
to concern yourself about.

442
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:34,546
Just trying to be here
for you.

443
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:36,382
I want to help.

444
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:39,051
Okay, well, when you get
your real estate license,

445
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:41,387
you can go out and work,
and I'll stay home.

446
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:51,022
You know, sometimes I think
you just want me gone.

447
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,609
Divorce, new life,
new wife, is that it?

448
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:58,279
Really? You want to have
that argument right now, huh?

449
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:08,331
Next do you want to talk about
why we don't have kids, hmm?

450
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,544
Hmm?

451
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:17,174
Maybe you want an affair, hmm?

452
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:21,427
New man, new life.

453
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:22,846
Do you want to be married?

454
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,687
I want you to tell me
we're okay.

455
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,868
We're okay.

456
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:01,551
When you texted,

457
00:32:01,595 --> 00:32:04,346
"What do we do?"

458
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,723
what did you mean?

459
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,860
What did you think I meant?

460
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:20,321
We're talking about
something, Jake.

461
00:32:20,364 --> 00:32:22,448
What are we talking about?

462
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,663
A better life for both of us.

463
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:35,169
We can't go on this way,

464
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:38,589
and yeah,

465
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:40,508
we're talking about something,

466
00:32:40,553 --> 00:32:42,552
and you know exactly what it is

467
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:45,139
even if you can't
say it out loud.

468
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:22,968
Hey, hey, it's me.

469
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:24,970
Can... can Sylvester
watch the kids for a while?

470
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:27,806
I need to come over and talk.

471
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,309
Can you call Ang?

472
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:31,727
Okay, bye.

473
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:37,608
What am I doing?

474
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:51,581
Okay, spill it.

475
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,042
I think I'm gonna ask

476
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,834
Ste for a divorce.

477
00:33:55,878 --> 00:33:58,879
Are you sure?
It's it because of that guy?

478
00:33:58,923 --> 00:34:01,341
No. Well, yeah...

479
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:03,885
Yes, maybe.
I... I don't know.

480
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:05,386
You don't want
to get divorced.

481
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,013
You really think
your little sex toy

482
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:08,932
is gonna stick around
once you're broke?

483
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:11,517
He's just looking for
some rich bitch to pay his way.

484
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,854
Okay, that's not true.
Ste doesn't love me anymore.

485
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:16,981
I... quite frankly,
I am done pretending.

486
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:19,692
- Ang, if she's not happy...
- Happy's a relative term.

487
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:22,612
But if you're not willing
to work and sacrifice for it,

488
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:25,615
then it's time to move on.

489
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,660
Make a clean break and end it.

490
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:34,290
I got to go.

491
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:37,962
Ste's a sure thing, Brooke.

492
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:40,046
Don't forget that.

493
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:59,859
Oh, you okay?

494
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:05,197
I got you a gun.

495
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:11,203
Be sure to go to a gun range

496
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:13,038
and learn how to use this first.

497
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:14,790
I slept with someone.

498
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:20,462
I think that means
we should get a divorce.

499
00:35:31,934 --> 00:35:32,893
Wh... why?

500
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:35,644
You're not happy, Ste.

501
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:38,022
I don't... I don't make
you happy anymore.

502
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:41,942
I love you.

503
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:45,905
I don't want to lose you.

504
00:35:45,948 --> 00:35:47,489
This is my fault.

505
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:49,241
It's not your fault.

506
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,165
I haven't been paying enough
attention to you.

507
00:35:51,204 --> 00:35:53,622
- Ste, that's not...
- No, don't say anything.

508
00:35:55,876 --> 00:36:00,003
This land development deal,
it's... it's killing me.

509
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:03,756
I'm sorry.
I got us into this mess.

510
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:07,052
I got us into this whole mess.

511
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:08,511
It's my fault.

512
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:12,515
You did not... this is
not your fault.

513
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,685
This whole... whole baby thing
has completely messed me up.

514
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,360
I do not want
to lose you, okay?

515
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:25,153
I don't want to lose you.

516
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:27,781
Let's... let's go
to the mountains this weekend,

517
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:29,700
just you and me, okay?

518
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:33,120
Like old times,
we'll forget about everything.

519
00:36:35,582 --> 00:36:38,041
- Okay.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:07,073 --> 00:37:09,865
- Jake, you look like...
- Yeah, I know, thank you.

521
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:12,827
I look... I'm fine. I just didn't
get a ton of sleep last night.

522
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,121
I'm feeling a little burnt out.

523
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:16,998
My hotshot hadn't sold
a policy in...

524
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,208
Please don't worry.
I got a couple leads tonight.

525
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:22,628
That'll get me back up to speed.

526
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:25,256
All right.

527
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:05,339
Hi, honey,

528
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:07,049
I'm gonna go check in
with the concierge.

529
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:08,925
Oh, you,
uh... you want me to go?

530
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:11,762
No, no, no, you stay, relax.

531
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:13,264
I want this weekend
to be perfect.

532
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:18,602
I'll see if they have
any trail maps.

533
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:36,078
- Wh... what are you doing here?
- You texted me.

534
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:37,621
Why would you tell me
where you're at

535
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:39,456
unless you wanted me
to come find you?

536
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,085
Oh, my God, that is not why.
Jake, you can't be here.

537
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:46,047
You have to go.
You...

538
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,216
No, this can't work.

539
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,884
Hmm?

540
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,322
Has it occurred to you
how much older I am?

541
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:52,698
Ooh, I like
an experienced woman.

542
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:54,347
You know what you want.

543
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,182
We... we can't go on
like this forever.

544
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:59,018
Why not? Maybe great sex
is your fountain of youth.

545
00:38:59,062 --> 00:39:01,979
I... I told him, and he
doesn't want to let me go.

546
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:07,777
Come here.

547
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:10,655
Tomorrow, spread out.

548
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:14,450
You take the lower trail.
Let him take the ridge trail.

549
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:16,452
There's an abandoned lodge
up there

550
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:19,288
on the overlook.

551
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:21,040
I'll take care of it.

552
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:23,127
It'll look like an accident.

553
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:52,114
Tomorrow she'll be dead,

554
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:54,950
and the money will be ours.

555
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:57,911
Wonderful.

556
00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:12,176
This is fun, reminds me
of our honeymoon.

557
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:19,141
- Oh, shit.
- What?

558
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:20,767
I'm such an idiot.

559
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:22,478
I left my headphones.
Oh, let's go back.

560
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,623
No, that's okay.
I'll go get them.

561
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:25,148
I'll run down real quick.

562
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:26,149
I'll meet you at the top
at the ridge.

563
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,817
I'll be right back.

564
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,762
God, Jake, pick up.
Pick up, damn it.

565
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,458
Oh, my God, it's you.

566
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:30,339
Did you do it?

567
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:32,633
- No.
- Oh, thank God.

568
00:41:32,677 --> 00:41:35,094
Jake, we can't, okay?
It just is a mistake.

569
00:41:35,137 --> 00:41:36,823
We would live with it
for the rest of our lives.

570
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:38,597
We'll do what you said, okay?

571
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:41,308
I'll divorce him,
and we can run off together.

572
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,897
What? What is it?

573
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:55,489
Jake? Jake?

574
00:42:00,871 --> 00:42:03,664
What'd she look like?

575
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,457
Her expression
when you pushed her?

576
00:42:07,336 --> 00:42:10,297
You said she hated you,
and she would jump

577
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,381
at the chance to kill you.
Yeah.

578
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:14,342
She was sleeping around
all over Buckhead.

579
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:18,178
She changed her mind.

580
00:42:18,222 --> 00:42:22,058
You didn't do it.

581
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:29,023
Why?

582
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:31,610
Are you in love with her?

583
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:35,780
Oh, Christ almighty, you are.

584
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:39,326
She got to you.

585
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:41,411
- Did she?
- You're not thinking clearly.

586
00:42:41,455 --> 00:42:43,413
I think I'm thinking
very clearly, thank you.

587
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:46,458
It's time, Jake.
She used me.

588
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,044
She married me for my money.

589
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:51,963
She never loved me,
not one single minute.

590
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:54,090
She cheated on my
any chance she got.

591
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:55,759
You proved how easily
she would do it.

592
00:42:55,802 --> 00:42:57,177
You married her.

593
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:00,555
That is what
we are trying to fix.

594
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,394
God, I need that 15 million,
otherwise I am ruined.

595
00:43:12,362 --> 00:43:15,112
Fifteen?

596
00:43:15,156 --> 00:43:17,155
Oh, come on.

597
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,785
Of course we're gonna split it.
That goes without saying.

598
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:26,415
If it goes without saying,

599
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:27,978
why did you
just say something different?

600
00:43:28,002 --> 00:43:31,712
Oh, my God.

601
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:35,216
What does it matter
who has the money?

602
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:38,636
We'll be together.

603
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,805
You having qualms, Jake?

604
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:42,474
Hmm?

605
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:44,684
I didn't think they were
in your repertoire.

606
00:43:44,728 --> 00:43:47,269
- I didn't think so either.
- You liar!

607
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:54,151
Before Jake I never slept
with anyone but you.

608
00:43:54,195 --> 00:43:55,737
- No.
- I loved you.

609
00:43:55,781 --> 00:43:57,738
That's not true.

610
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:00,951
You only married me to get away
from your trailer trash mother.

611
00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:02,494
That's not true.

612
00:44:02,538 --> 00:44:05,246
You're a whore,
and I loved you.

613
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:07,039
Hey!
Jake.

614
00:44:16,427 --> 00:44:18,343
He didn't... he didn't love me?

615
00:44:20,722 --> 00:44:23,724
He... he was gonna kill me

616
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,559
for money to save his... his...

617
00:44:25,602 --> 00:44:27,936
We were killing him for money.

618
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,521
He was just being
honest about it.

619
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:32,023
We were doing it
for love, Jake.

620
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,234
And the money
to enjoy our love.

621
00:44:34,278 --> 00:44:36,778
Love?

622
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:38,530
Is that what this is?

623
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,241
Yes. I don't usually
feel things, Brooke,

624
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:43,994
but with you, with you I do.

625
00:44:44,037 --> 00:44:45,871
I really... I do.

626
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:50,084
Okay, all right, okay.

627
00:44:54,716 --> 00:44:57,841
The police will think
he leaned too far over the edge

628
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:00,677
for the good shot, and he fell.

629
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:04,932
Remember, he was crazy about
getting the best shots.

630
00:45:04,976 --> 00:45:07,017
You need to go now,
to the other trail,

631
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,771
and remember if you see anyone,
say something memorable.

632
00:45:09,814 --> 00:45:11,021
Go.

633
00:45:11,064 --> 00:45:15,108
Just...

634
00:45:23,744 --> 00:45:26,412
Ah.
Damn you.

635
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,474
Thank you.

636
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:57,360
You have a package.

637
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:11,833
- Yes?
- Hey, it's me. What is this?

638
00:46:11,877 --> 00:46:13,460
It's a precaution.

639
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,212
It's disposable,
cheap, untraceable.

640
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:16,880
Yeah, but why? Why now?

641
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:19,341
We cannot see each other,
not for a while.

642
00:46:20,094 --> 00:46:21,677
They're doing due diligence

643
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,428
since the policy
was taken out so recently.

644
00:46:23,472 --> 00:46:25,180
It's nothing that
I didn't anticipate.

645
00:46:25,224 --> 00:46:26,640
Well, if you anticipated it,

646
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:31,103
you would have
given this to me sooner.

647
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,483
You miss me?

648
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:40,904
Jake?
Do you miss me?

649
00:46:40,948 --> 00:46:43,699
Yes.

650
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:47,744
Of course, terribly.

651
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:56,296
Ah, Jake.

652
00:46:56,338 --> 00:46:57,922
Corporate's not happy.

653
00:46:57,966 --> 00:47:00,341
Yeah, I'll bet.
What's your angle, the wife?

654
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,302
Got to be.

655
00:47:02,345 --> 00:47:04,888
Are there any scratches on
him from her fingernails or...

656
00:47:04,931 --> 00:47:07,973
No, just from the fall, but
there's an autopsy in process.

657
00:47:10,312 --> 00:47:12,478
Hey, Jake?

658
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:14,355
You didn't sleep
with her, did you?

659
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:18,693
I flirt, Wong.
Past that, things get messy.

660
00:47:25,202 --> 00:47:26,868
Yeah, it's me.

661
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:32,082
I need you back at the office.

662
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,433
Oh, Brooke, oh, my God.

663
00:47:54,773 --> 00:47:59,068
I'm so sorry. I can't imagine
what you must be going through.

664
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,028
One moment someone
you love is there,

665
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:02,488
and then...

666
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:05,115
how could this happen?

667
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:08,076
You're here.
That's what matters.

668
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,205
Angie didn't even call.
Oh, sweetie, don't think.

669
00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:13,624
She just doesn't deal
with death well.

670
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:16,418
And what am I, a pro?

671
00:48:16,462 --> 00:48:18,295
She's got a touch
of the stomach flu.

672
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:20,179
She loves you, 'kay?
She'll be at the memorial.

673
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,097
You don't find it strange
that a man

674
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,808
with so much hiking experience
could just fall like that?

675
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:33,852
- What are you saying?
- Well, hypothetically,

676
00:48:33,897 --> 00:48:36,231
what if... what if
it wasn't an accident?

677
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:39,400
Yeah, who would want Ste dead?

678
00:48:39,443 --> 00:48:42,612
We all have secrets.

679
00:48:42,656 --> 00:48:44,738
Oh, you mean a lover?

680
00:48:46,283 --> 00:48:49,243
Yeah, maybe if Ste
were interested in sex.

681
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:56,042
Or maybe it was money,

682
00:48:56,085 --> 00:48:58,211
gambling problems,

683
00:48:58,255 --> 00:48:59,921
a bookie, a creative hit man?

684
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,718
I mean, we...

685
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,347
We are facing
bankruptcy, so who knows?

686
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:11,182
I am so sorry.

687
00:49:11,226 --> 00:49:12,986
I didn't mea... I'm just trying
to protect you.

688
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,644
From what?

689
00:49:14,688 --> 00:49:18,566
The thing is if it wasn't
an accident,

690
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:21,109
people on TV
always suspect the wife.

691
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:24,237
- Okay, so what's my motive?
- Is there life insurance?

692
00:49:25,992 --> 00:49:27,742
God, do you... do you have

693
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:29,743
a reason to believe
that this wasn't an accident?

694
00:49:29,786 --> 00:49:31,829
Of course not.

695
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:34,665
No, I'm just thinking like
they do, and there was

696
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:38,210
a car parked outside.
It drove off when I came up.

697
00:49:38,254 --> 00:49:40,253
I know.

698
00:49:40,298 --> 00:49:42,380
Hey,

699
00:49:42,424 --> 00:49:45,051
I'm not as helpless
as you think I am.

700
00:49:45,094 --> 00:49:47,470
Uh, Jake, this is Mike Wall,

701
00:49:47,513 --> 00:49:51,056
investigator
on the Stevens case.

702
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:53,267
- It's a case now?
- There's been a development.

703
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:58,522
A button on Stevens' vest
had a partial print.

704
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:00,107
Not his?

705
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:02,068
Well, the feds are checking
the database.

706
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,404
I got a friend.

707
00:50:05,448 --> 00:50:07,907
All right, well,
if I can help in any way.

708
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:12,745
See you at the funeral.

709
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:14,748
Seems like a nice guy.

710
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:16,916
Yeah, I wouldn't
take it that far.

711
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:23,924
But he's good at his job.

712
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,947
Go comfort the wife,
see what you can find.

713
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:04,005
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Stevens.

714
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:05,715
They are trying
to deny your claim.

715
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:07,425
The police gave it
the all-clear,

716
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:09,073
but the bastards in Hartford
hired an investigator

717
00:51:09,097 --> 00:51:11,513
to look into it.

718
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:13,014
How are you holding up?

719
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:15,642
- I'm holding up.
- They're watching us.

720
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:18,603
Do not contact me
under any circumstances,

721
00:51:18,647 --> 00:51:20,897
and be careful
of that investigator, Wall.

722
00:51:20,941 --> 00:51:24,652
- Mrs. Stevens, condolences.
- Thank you.

723
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:30,031
I'm Mike Wall
with the insurance company.

724
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:33,452
Sorry to interrupt,
but let me explain.

725
00:51:33,495 --> 00:51:36,622
Your husband had what's
considered a suspicious death,

726
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,583
and if in the event
there was foul play,

727
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:40,585
we're hoping you can help.

728
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:43,045
- I... I don't understand.
- Well, people at his office

729
00:51:43,089 --> 00:51:45,548
say he was talking
about disappearing.

730
00:51:45,592 --> 00:51:47,382
Perhaps he was
going into hiding,

731
00:51:47,427 --> 00:51:49,510
or maybe he was afraid
for his life.

732
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:51,053
No, that's... that's crazy.

733
00:51:51,097 --> 00:51:52,408
Well, we'd like to come
by your home

734
00:51:52,432 --> 00:51:54,056
and check his computer.

735
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,018
Oh, by any chance,
have you seen his iPad?

736
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:59,395
I mean, who knows
what we might discover?

737
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,355
No.
Uh, what do you hope to find?

738
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:03,274
Well, an email
on his cell suggests

739
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:07,278
there might be another account,
another email address

740
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:10,698
that isn't in his name
or on his phone.

741
00:52:10,742 --> 00:52:14,453
We think he downloaded messages
on his iPad or home computer.

742
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:16,412
Well, his iPad is... is
not at home,

743
00:52:16,456 --> 00:52:17,934
but I can look for it
and get back to you.

744
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,626
Well, may we come by
and look for it?

745
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:22,229
Strangers pawing through
my underwear drawer

746
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:23,629
on the day
of my husband's funeral?

747
00:52:23,672 --> 00:52:25,214
No, thank you.

748
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:26,857
Yeah, well, people
who die accidentally

749
00:52:26,883 --> 00:52:29,259
don't first dispose
of their electronics.

750
00:52:29,303 --> 00:52:32,221
- I said I'd get back to you.
- Yes, and if you don't,

751
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:35,389
I'll see you at your home
with a warrant in hand.

752
00:52:35,433 --> 00:52:36,767
This is inappropriate.

753
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,477
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

754
00:53:02,628 --> 00:53:07,256
You went to Venice with Irene?

755
00:53:07,299 --> 00:53:12,010
Who the hell is Irene?
Oh, hey.

756
00:53:33,535 --> 00:53:35,660
Robert Lange?

757
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,551
Okay, let's try this again.

758
00:53:50,593 --> 00:53:53,594
Brooke, if you're getting this,

759
00:53:53,638 --> 00:53:57,223
that means that
I've left it for you,

760
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,768
and if I left it for you,
that means I've left you.

761
00:54:02,522 --> 00:54:04,188
But not... not just you.

762
00:54:04,232 --> 00:54:06,983
I've left myself, our life.

763
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:10,486
When I heard about your
affairs, it devastated me,

764
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,572
but I don't blame you.

765
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:16,117
I'm a failure in everything.

766
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:22,708
In marriage, in business,
in everything.

767
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:33,426
No, no, it's too humiliating.

768
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:39,350
Yes.
Oh, there, buddy.

769
00:54:41,854 --> 00:54:45,564
What the hell?

770
00:55:52,843 --> 00:55:57,179
Carlita, can you
take the trash out?

771
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:18,011
Brooke?

772
00:57:30,108 --> 00:57:31,816
We pray to thee,

773
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,320
our God, this day
for the blessings you provide.

774
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:40,992
You haven't answered my texts.

775
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:43,663
I hate you.
I don't know why I'm here.

776
00:57:43,706 --> 00:57:47,083
You're here to renew
our sacred vows.

777
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:49,293
No, I'm not
doing this anymore.

778
00:57:49,337 --> 00:57:51,837
I'm being followed.
We shouldn't even be meeting.

779
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,381
- Beneath thy almighty wing.
- You sure?

780
00:57:54,425 --> 00:57:56,926
Jake, did you not hear
what I said?

781
00:57:58,137 --> 00:58:00,888
Oh, God,
the spirit of all our joys,

782
00:58:00,932 --> 00:58:04,850
the cause of our delights,

783
00:58:04,894 --> 00:58:08,396
the glory of our darkest nights,

784
00:58:08,439 --> 00:58:11,023
the comfort in times like these.

785
00:58:18,157 --> 00:58:21,534
There is only one way to live
for people like us, Brooke.

786
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:24,579
We have to risk everything.

787
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:28,541
That risk is what we crave
to feel alive.

788
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,251
It turns you on.

789
00:58:34,592 --> 00:58:37,467
We need to feel something,
and we need it desperately.

790
00:58:42,141 --> 00:58:43,682
Jake, we can't do this.

791
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:46,059
What, God doesn't
approve of sex?

792
00:58:46,103 --> 00:58:48,603
He invented sex.

793
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:57,779
Both:

794
00:58:57,822 --> 00:59:01,158
This is crazy.
We could get caught.

795
00:59:02,828 --> 00:59:06,371
Mm-hmm. That's why you
don't want me to stop.

796
00:59:57,759 --> 01:00:01,052
You filmed yourselves.

797
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:03,012
Jake, I watched it all.

798
01:00:03,056 --> 01:00:05,098
Not me, him. I didn't know.

799
01:00:07,602 --> 01:00:09,727
Whenever you weren't together,

800
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:13,815
you were with me,
and he was with this Irene.

801
01:00:13,858 --> 01:00:17,777
She was just loose change,
his words, not mine.

802
01:00:17,821 --> 01:00:21,031
You two just screw whatever.

803
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,741
Man, woman, don't matter.

804
01:00:23,785 --> 01:00:26,911
That matters.
They're different.

805
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:29,206
Yeah, I'm aware.

806
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:35,963
What about Ste?

807
01:00:36,006 --> 01:00:38,924
Closeted?
Bisexual?

808
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,718
What is the difference?

809
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:43,095
I mean, we're all
just the same, right?

810
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:46,390
We're just trying desperately
to connect to someone, anyone.

811
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:52,688
I was married to someone that
I didn't have a clue about.

812
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,569
And I don't know
who the hell you are.

813
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,122
I'm not sure you're
still with me, Brooke.

814
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:14,668
I need to trust
that you and I are together.

815
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,471
I am sorry about this.

816
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:27,723
Insurance in case you... I mean,

817
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,225
you know,
I am in the insurance industry.

818
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,898
- You have killed 12 people?
- Give or take.

819
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,775
Say what the job is.

820
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,401
If you're arrested
on her word, I kill the bitc.

821
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,737
What's your weapon of choice?

822
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:43,906
Glock and silencer.

823
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:45,867
I said I was sorry.

824
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:49,661
If it's any consolation,
the insurance scam was my idea.

825
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:52,624
I put Stevens up to it.
He was desperate.

826
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,626
When I realized that
he was planning

827
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,961
an "accidental" suicide
to leave you the money,

828
01:01:57,005 --> 01:02:01,090
I figured out a way for me
to make money in the process.

829
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,759
Look, Brooke,
things turned out this way

830
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,469
because I fell in love with you.

831
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,846
I chose you.

832
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:32,456
- My coffee cup's missing.
- Maybe it's in the sink.

833
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:36,668
I, uh, like to visualize.

834
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:39,797
Possible third person,
mystery man or woman.

835
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:43,968
Looking at the way
that Stevens was found,

836
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:46,637
forensics thinks
that he fell backwards.

837
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:49,974
Meaning?

838
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:52,977
More than likely
he was pushed.

839
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:02,236
Or he was taking a selfie.

840
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,113
The view up there really
is quite something.

841
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:06,323
Is it really?

842
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,409
That's what I hear.

843
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:11,829
I wouldn't know.
I prefer tarmac to trees.

844
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:14,999
Mm.

845
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:36,145
Hello?

846
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:43,612
Of course
there's a liability hazard.

847
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,322
The signs were obscured.

848
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:47,490
There was no railing,
and it's your property.

849
01:03:47,534 --> 01:03:50,702
Wh... then make me a good offer.

850
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:55,373
Thank you.
I accept.

851
01:03:58,295 --> 01:03:59,920
Mrs. Stevens,

852
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:02,422
we have a warrant
to search these premises.

853
01:04:12,518 --> 01:04:14,143
You were right.

854
01:04:14,187 --> 01:04:18,272
It was in the sink,
only I didn't put it there.

855
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:22,068
Jake, where were you
the morning that Stevens died?

856
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:23,735
I tried to reach you.

857
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,320
You didn't
come in till mid-afternoon.

858
01:04:25,364 --> 01:04:27,448
- When do I usually come in?
- Afternoon.

859
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,991
- Why is that?
- Well, the thing is that

860
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:31,535
the policy you gave me

861
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:34,288
was dated the night
before the murder.

862
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:36,666
Murder?

863
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:39,126
Oh, sorry, sorry, not proven.

864
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:43,047
The night before Stevens died,
that policy.

865
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:45,424
You know, I, uh,

866
01:04:45,468 --> 01:04:47,385
had to call the insured.

867
01:04:47,428 --> 01:04:49,095
Couldn't read his handwriting.

868
01:04:49,138 --> 01:04:52,474
Yeah, well, with computers
now, no one can write anymore.

869
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:57,228
Your insured said he bought
the policy earlier.

870
01:04:57,271 --> 01:04:59,856
The night in question
he was with his sister.

871
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,608
Maybe I accidentally
entered the wrong date.

872
01:05:02,652 --> 01:05:04,611
Come on, boss,

873
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:06,863
are you really accusing me
of being involved in this?

874
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:14,913
Check my phone records.
That'll tell you where I was.

875
01:05:14,957 --> 01:05:16,707
- We did.
- Mm.

876
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,333
Thank you for your faith in me.

877
01:05:18,377 --> 01:05:19,646
You know corporate's
first thought,

878
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,086
agent is co-conspirator.

879
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,879
We had to get you
off their radar.

880
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:24,964
Tell them to do something
anatomically impossible.

881
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,092
Look, Wall took your prints
off that cup.

882
01:05:27,136 --> 01:05:28,719
That's why it was in the sink.

883
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:31,805
Again, only to eliminate you.

884
01:05:31,848 --> 01:05:33,682
Thank you for saying that.

885
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:35,475
How's the real
investigation coming?

886
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:42,482
The police checked
Mrs. Stevens' phone records.

887
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:45,193
Shows calls coming in and out
from the cell phone

888
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:47,571
and a disposable.

889
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:52,701
Like this?

890
01:05:52,745 --> 01:05:55,662
The calls stopped
when Stevens died.

891
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:57,581
Why don't the cops
just trace the phone?

892
01:05:57,624 --> 01:06:01,626
The SIM card was removed
and the phone destroyed.

893
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:04,088
Convenient, huh?

894
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:09,551
Jake, they're on it.

895
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:14,932
I thought you needed to know.

896
01:06:24,903 --> 01:06:27,236
Told you it wasn't here.

897
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:31,824
You can let yourselves out.

898
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:36,913
Hey.

899
01:06:36,956 --> 01:06:38,998
Hey, honey,
I was thinking about you.

900
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:40,583
Do you need me to come over?

901
01:06:40,628 --> 01:06:43,294
No, I'm fine.

902
01:06:43,338 --> 01:06:46,714
You really shouldn't be
alone right now.

903
01:06:46,758 --> 01:06:50,176
You know what? You're right.
Hey, Tara, do we know an Irene?

904
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,012
- I don't think so.
- Hmm.

905
01:06:53,056 --> 01:06:54,473
Yeah, remember your trip
to Italy?

906
01:06:54,517 --> 01:06:58,018
Is that where you met
that model?

907
01:06:58,061 --> 01:07:00,645
Why?

908
01:07:00,689 --> 01:07:03,148
Just, uh... doesn't matter.

909
01:07:03,192 --> 01:07:06,110
I'll see you soon.

910
01:07:48,905 --> 01:07:51,072
Angie, what are you...

911
01:07:51,116 --> 01:07:53,615
What are you doing here?

912
01:07:53,659 --> 01:07:55,160
You startled me.

913
01:07:55,203 --> 01:07:57,077
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

914
01:07:57,121 --> 01:07:59,580
About what?

915
01:08:07,924 --> 01:08:10,049
How'd you like Venice, Irene?

916
01:08:10,093 --> 01:08:11,550
A lot.

917
01:08:11,594 --> 01:08:13,260
It didn't seem like
a bad thing to do

918
01:08:13,304 --> 01:08:15,053
to one of your best friends?

919
01:08:15,098 --> 01:08:18,016
- Were we ever really friends?
- Well, I did think so.

920
01:08:19,519 --> 01:08:21,811
You know, the... the
funny thing is I,

921
01:08:21,855 --> 01:08:25,064
uh... I thought
that Tara was Irene.

922
01:08:25,108 --> 01:08:28,443
Venice was a scouting
expedition to see where we'd go

923
01:08:28,486 --> 01:08:32,071
once we had the money
and the baby was born.

924
01:08:32,115 --> 01:08:34,240
Remember, stomach flu?

925
01:08:34,284 --> 01:08:37,702
I'm eight weeks in,
and it is not Buck's.

926
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:39,515
Believe me, he couldn't
get it up with a forklift

927
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:41,915
and a bottle of blues.

928
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:43,834
I want half for me and the baby.

929
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:46,045
Otherwise I make a claim,
and you get nothing.

930
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:47,880
I'm sorry, how's that?

931
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:50,257
The claim would be
for Stevens' child.

932
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,384
In a few weeks they can do
a DNA test to prove paternity,

933
01:08:53,428 --> 01:08:57,222
at which point little Stevens
would be the beneficiary,

934
01:08:57,265 --> 01:09:00,059
not you.
Check the policy.

935
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:03,771
Trust me, that's what it says,
and here's the kicker.

936
01:09:03,814 --> 01:09:07,065
The policy pays us
even if you killed Ste.

937
01:09:07,108 --> 01:09:08,567
And being the mother,

938
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,736
you would get
a generous living allowance.

939
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,572
You create a trust
to receive the insurance.

940
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:16,450
Once paternity's proved
that it's Stevens' child,

941
01:09:16,494 --> 01:09:20,955
you and the baby
will split 50/50.

942
01:09:20,998 --> 01:09:22,539
Is Tara in on this?

943
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:24,708
No, no,
she's your actual friend.

944
01:09:24,752 --> 01:09:26,460
I just told her.

945
01:09:26,504 --> 01:09:28,440
She's my insurance if
you attempted to kill me too.

946
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,631
Okay, I didn't kill Ste.

947
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:32,258
You will let me know
by tomorrow.

948
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,552
Otherwise I make my claim.

949
01:09:35,596 --> 01:09:39,556
And, uh, thanks for the cookies.

950
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,601
They were delicious.

951
01:09:50,404 --> 01:09:51,588
- I don't know, Brooke.
- Please, Tara?

952
01:09:51,612 --> 01:09:53,529
For old time's sake?

953
01:09:53,573 --> 01:09:56,199
Yeah, I don't want anything
big, just the three of us.

954
01:09:56,242 --> 01:10:00,369
- Well, okay then.
- You're an angel.

955
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:03,123
Tomorrow at 5:00?
Bye.

956
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:13,008
Angie, it's me.
We have a deal.

957
01:10:18,724 --> 01:10:21,100
Mr. Wong,
this is Brooke Stevens.

958
01:10:25,272 --> 01:10:29,274
Jake, uh, you'll never guess
who's here to see you.

959
01:10:29,318 --> 01:10:30,901
Judging by your excitement,

960
01:10:30,945 --> 01:10:32,297
it wouldn't be Mrs. Stevens,
would it?

961
01:10:32,321 --> 01:10:34,238
Oh, you're good.

962
01:10:34,282 --> 01:10:36,657
Oh, and Wall's fingerprint
report will be here today.

963
01:10:41,413 --> 01:10:42,913
Hi, Mrs. Stevens.

964
01:10:42,957 --> 01:10:45,249
Can I get you something,
coffee, water?

965
01:10:45,293 --> 01:10:49,669
You and the police have
searched my husband's office,

966
01:10:49,714 --> 01:10:52,214
my house, watched my house,

967
01:10:52,258 --> 01:10:54,508
had me followed.
Why?

968
01:10:54,552 --> 01:10:56,594
It's all perfectly normal.

969
01:10:56,637 --> 01:10:58,346
You're the beneficiary
and the spouse.

970
01:10:58,389 --> 01:11:02,058
Statistically speaking,
you're doubly suspect.

971
01:11:02,101 --> 01:11:03,517
You think I killed my husband?

972
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:05,101
Conjecture's for amateurs.

973
01:11:05,146 --> 01:11:07,855
I simply explore
secondary explanations.

974
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:09,982
Now, I'm glad we're having
this talk, Mrs. Stevens.

975
01:11:10,026 --> 01:11:12,693
I admire a forthright person.

976
01:11:12,737 --> 01:11:15,654
Do you mind if I ask you
an equally direct question?

977
01:11:15,698 --> 01:11:18,950
Sure. I mean,
you haven't answered mine,

978
01:11:18,993 --> 01:11:22,412
but I'll go first.
How long after you're paid,

979
01:11:22,455 --> 01:11:24,706
if you're paid,
do you intend to leave town?

980
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,832
Well, I... I don't
remember the word

981
01:11:26,876 --> 01:11:28,794
for the smallest
possible increment of time.

982
01:11:28,836 --> 01:11:30,544
The reason why I ask,

983
01:11:30,588 --> 01:11:32,839
Wall's found evidence
of a possible accomplice.

984
01:11:32,882 --> 01:11:34,591
As of now we've come
to no conclusions,

985
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:36,802
but if we do,
it could implicate you.

986
01:11:36,845 --> 01:11:38,428
Yeah.

987
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:42,890
The resort has already
paid $1 million in negligence.

988
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:48,562
I'd appreciate if you could
expedite your payment also.

989
01:11:48,606 --> 01:11:50,190
I'll see what I can do.

990
01:11:53,612 --> 01:11:56,196
Have a good day.

991
01:12:13,925 --> 01:12:15,757
Hey.

992
01:12:15,801 --> 01:12:17,175
Thanks again for doing this.

993
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:19,386
What are we eating?
I'm starving.

994
01:12:21,014 --> 01:12:24,015
Oh. I wasn't expecting you.

995
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:28,645
Surprise. I thought
we could celebrate.

996
01:12:28,689 --> 01:12:31,523
Damn, I'd have
brought balloons.

997
01:12:31,567 --> 01:12:35,069
Angie, you did me a favor.

998
01:12:35,113 --> 01:12:37,779
You know, you took
Ste off my hands,

999
01:12:37,823 --> 01:12:41,117
or to be more specific, my body.

1000
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,827
My pleasure.

1001
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:45,121
Well, I hope so
'cause it wasn't mine.

1002
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:52,044
Look, as... as weird as this
may sound,

1003
01:12:52,088 --> 01:12:55,006
you two are kind of
my only friends here,

1004
01:12:55,048 --> 01:12:56,466
so I can hold a grudge,

1005
01:12:56,509 --> 01:12:58,968
or I can remember
the good times.

1006
01:13:00,763 --> 01:13:02,180
Is this for real?

1007
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:04,599
I'll just give you
two a moment.

1008
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:09,937
If she tries to kill you, shout.

1009
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:18,905
Half a million,
cashier's check.

1010
01:13:18,948 --> 01:13:20,615
I can't void it.

1011
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:40,385
We got the fingerprint
final report.

1012
01:13:40,429 --> 01:13:42,638
Looks like a match.

1013
01:13:46,477 --> 01:13:49,353
- Really?
- Yes.

1014
01:13:49,396 --> 01:13:53,524
Unfortunately, it's a partial.
It's the tip of a forefinger.

1015
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:55,526
It would never
stand up in court.

1016
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:58,655
- I guess it's a washout.
- Apparently.

1017
01:13:58,697 --> 01:14:00,155
Oh, by the way, Mrs. Stevens

1018
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:02,075
settled her case
against the resort.

1019
01:14:02,118 --> 01:14:05,578
Really? How much?

1020
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:08,747
A million in cash, tax-free.

1021
01:14:14,839 --> 01:14:16,381
What?

1022
01:14:16,424 --> 01:14:18,174
I know you, Jake,

1023
01:14:18,218 --> 01:14:20,969
since you were five.

1024
01:14:21,012 --> 01:14:23,011
I know your tells.

1025
01:14:23,055 --> 01:14:25,347
I see your tells.

1026
01:15:14,984 --> 01:15:17,609
Angie miscarried.
They found drugs in her system.

1027
01:15:17,653 --> 01:15:19,193
I know.

1028
01:15:19,237 --> 01:15:20,820
It's really easy
to get prescriptions

1029
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:22,364
from Canada in the mail.

1030
01:15:22,408 --> 01:15:26,159
What? How could you?

1031
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:27,888
Yeah, it's like... it's
like we don't even know

1032
01:15:27,912 --> 01:15:30,956
who the other is anymore.

1033
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,959
You never thought to ask what
was in those cookies, did you?

1034
01:15:35,588 --> 01:15:38,796
You're one coldblooded bitch.

1035
01:15:38,841 --> 01:15:40,506
Well, that is a compliment

1036
01:15:40,551 --> 01:15:42,926
coming from you, Angie.

1037
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:46,472
Don't feel too special though.

1038
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:50,017
I'm, uh... I'm not the only
one that Ste played.

1039
01:15:50,061 --> 01:15:54,521
When he was with you,
he was screwing another man.

1040
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:56,565
Wrong.

1041
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:59,610
Ste wasn't smart enough
for all of this.

1042
01:15:59,654 --> 01:16:02,947
What are you saying?

1043
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,699
It was me.

1044
01:16:04,743 --> 01:16:06,533
Stevens adored you,

1045
01:16:06,577 --> 01:16:09,204
so much he was actually willing
to kill himself

1046
01:16:09,247 --> 01:16:11,455
to leave you insurance money.

1047
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,585
He wanted to save you
from his shame of bankruptcy,

1048
01:16:15,629 --> 01:16:17,879
but that would have been
a waste of good money,

1049
01:16:17,923 --> 01:16:20,589
so I convinced him

1050
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:23,093
that you were
a philandering bitch,

1051
01:16:23,136 --> 01:16:24,593
and that broke his heart.

1052
01:16:24,638 --> 01:16:26,096
No, Jake said
this was his idea.

1053
01:16:26,139 --> 01:16:27,806
I'm sure he did.

1054
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:30,183
I didn't figure
that shit would seduce

1055
01:16:30,227 --> 01:16:31,851
Ste and cut me out,

1056
01:16:31,895 --> 01:16:34,479
but obviously

1057
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:37,357
he was willing to do anything.

1058
01:16:37,401 --> 01:16:40,777
Ste was weak and easy
to manipulate.

1059
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:43,363
You bitch.
You did this.

1060
01:16:43,407 --> 01:16:46,116
You did... you did all of this.

1061
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:51,121
For money.

1062
01:16:51,164 --> 01:16:53,456
You're no different than me.

1063
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,711
You murdered the one man that
was willing to die for you.

1064
01:16:58,423 --> 01:17:00,798
Why didn't you tell me?

1065
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,968
I didn't even know
she was pregnant.

1066
01:17:28,702 --> 01:17:31,120
Brooke?

1067
01:18:02,029 --> 01:18:03,779
Brooke!

1068
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:11,912
Brooke, where are you?

1069
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:13,705
911, what's your emergency?

1070
01:18:13,749 --> 01:18:16,207
Help, someone's broken
into my house.

1071
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,834
I know you're there.

1072
01:18:30,057 --> 01:18:33,350
You got insurance money,
and you didn't split it?

1073
01:18:33,393 --> 01:18:35,186
I thought that
might bother you.

1074
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:40,315
And if you don't split
that with me,

1075
01:18:41,735 --> 01:18:43,194
you can't even tell me about it?

1076
01:18:43,238 --> 01:18:45,403
That's why I told Wong.

1077
01:18:45,447 --> 01:18:49,033
That makes me insecure about
that life insurance payout.

1078
01:18:50,911 --> 01:18:52,578
I won't split the money.

1079
01:18:54,373 --> 01:18:57,290
You seem to have forgotten
something, Brooke.

1080
01:18:57,334 --> 01:18:58,793
Who killed him?

1081
01:18:58,837 --> 01:19:02,587
Who killed him?
I can't remember.

1082
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:06,676
- You did.
- Yes, of course I did.

1083
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,346
- But I told you not to, right?
- Right.

1084
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:13,850
- And you did it anyway.
- And that's my point.

1085
01:19:13,893 --> 01:19:17,228
If I hadn't have done that,
if I hadn't have done that,

1086
01:19:17,272 --> 01:19:21,190
you would have nothing
right now, just like me!

1087
01:19:21,234 --> 01:19:23,442
Is that what you want,
to shoot me?

1088
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:26,195
Maybe.

1089
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,947
Or maybe I'll wait.

1090
01:19:31,452 --> 01:19:33,369
The Earth is small, Brooke.

1091
01:19:33,413 --> 01:19:36,080
It is too small to hide.

1092
01:19:36,124 --> 01:19:38,040
One day you'll turn around,

1093
01:19:38,084 --> 01:19:40,668
and you will see
my smiling face.

1094
01:19:57,229 --> 01:20:00,522
I loved you, Jake.

1095
01:20:00,566 --> 01:20:04,358
God, I loved you so much.

1096
01:20:04,402 --> 01:20:06,904
Then why didn't you pay?

1097
01:20:06,947 --> 01:20:10,449
'Cause I was
doing it for love.

1098
01:20:10,492 --> 01:20:14,244
You can't love anyone.

1099
01:20:14,288 --> 01:20:17,164
Yeah.

1100
01:20:17,207 --> 01:20:19,124
I'm sorry about that.

1101
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,488
Do you have kids?

1102
01:20:49,531 --> 01:20:52,325
Mm-hmm.

1103
01:20:52,368 --> 01:20:55,161
Do not leave this laying
around the house.

1104
01:20:59,793 --> 01:21:02,585
Mr. Walters planned
to blackmail your husband?

1105
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:03,836
About the affair, yes.

1106
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,798
Until he had a better idea.

1107
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,174
To kill Ste and blackmail me.

1108
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:10,843
We're not fools,
Mrs. Stevens.

1109
01:21:10,886 --> 01:21:13,680
That isn't exactly the
most credible scenario.

1110
01:21:13,723 --> 01:21:15,682
That's precisely
what Jake said,

1111
01:21:15,725 --> 01:21:18,017
and how he...

1112
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:20,520
How he blackmailed me.

1113
01:21:20,563 --> 01:21:22,647
Who killed him?
Who killed him?

1114
01:21:22,691 --> 01:21:25,525
I can't remember.

1115
01:21:25,568 --> 01:21:28,195
- You did.
- Yes, of course I did.

1116
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:30,613
But I told you not to, right?

1117
01:21:30,657 --> 01:21:31,906
Right.

1118
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:35,368
And you did it anyway.

1119
01:21:35,412 --> 01:21:37,329
And that's my point.

1120
01:21:37,373 --> 01:21:39,665
If I hadn't have done that,

1121
01:21:39,709 --> 01:21:42,125
you would have nothing
right now.

1122
01:21:44,421 --> 01:21:47,715
I couldn't risk anymore.
I had to shut it off.

1123
01:21:47,758 --> 01:21:49,757
So you knew he was
gonna kill your husband.

1124
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:51,176
Of course not.

1125
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,322
Yeah, but you knew afterwards,

1126
01:21:52,346 --> 01:21:53,929
and you didn't come forward,

1127
01:21:53,973 --> 01:21:55,701
and that makes you
an accessory after the fact.

1128
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:58,642
Yes, but Jake was strategic.
He showed me a video,

1129
01:21:58,686 --> 01:22:00,936
which you will find
on his cell phone,

1130
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:03,981
of him threatening to kill me
if I went to the police.

1131
01:22:05,693 --> 01:22:08,735
CSI just fished parts
of two pink cell phones

1132
01:22:08,779 --> 01:22:10,779
out of your disposal.

1133
01:22:10,823 --> 01:22:13,991
Want to explain that?
Not really.

1134
01:22:19,582 --> 01:22:21,582
This should take care
of your family for a while.

1135
01:22:26,756 --> 01:22:30,841
Oh, thank you, Ms. Brooke.

1136
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:57,409
Mom, I've been thinking.

1137
01:22:57,454 --> 01:23:00,038
Those Vegas slots,
they really are something.

1138
01:23:03,168 --> 01:23:07,629
Well, pack your bags 'cause
we're going to Vegas tonight.

1139
01:23:09,174 --> 01:23:10,799
I love you.
Bye.

1140
01:23:10,842 --> 01:23:12,927
Hope you don't think
I'm incompetent.

1141
01:23:12,969 --> 01:23:14,678
Not at all.

1142
01:23:14,721 --> 01:23:17,639
Well, I'm impressed by...

1143
01:23:17,682 --> 01:23:19,891
In a horrified way...

1144
01:23:19,935 --> 01:23:22,268
By the way you've been able
to manage all this.

1145
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:27,399
I, um, wired the money
into your account.

1146
01:23:27,442 --> 01:23:29,818
Here's your copy.

1147
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:32,195
I like the personal touch.

1148
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,159
Largest amount I've ever seen.

1149
01:23:41,998 --> 01:23:45,876
You may not believe it, Mr.
Wong, but I didn't want this.

1150
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:51,006
All I wanted, all I ever wanted

1151
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:53,717
was for my husband to love me,

1152
01:23:56,973 --> 01:24:00,766
But that wasn't to be

1153
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:03,686
because that's not
the world we've made.

1154
01:24:03,729 --> 01:24:05,354
In this world

1155
01:24:05,398 --> 01:24:07,481
we're born alone, we live alone,

1156
01:24:07,525 --> 01:24:10,317
and we die in an even more
desperate state of loneliness.

1157
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:13,696
Sometimes,

1158
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:17,241
for brief moments, we have
the illusion of connection.

1159
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:23,415
Grab onto it, cherish it.

1160
01:24:25,836 --> 01:24:27,293
You can judge me.

1161
01:24:27,337 --> 01:24:30,045
I know you do.

1162
01:24:30,089 --> 01:24:34,133
Growing up, were you hit
every day instead of kissed?

1163
01:24:34,178 --> 01:24:37,053
How about adolescence?

1164
01:24:37,097 --> 01:24:39,180
Girls stare at your crotch

1165
01:24:39,223 --> 01:24:41,683
the way boys leered
at my breasts?

1166
01:24:41,727 --> 01:24:43,393
Probably not.

1167
01:24:43,437 --> 01:24:47,022
See, I found out that
it doesn't matter

1168
01:24:47,065 --> 01:24:49,316
if you come from nothing
or you're born into luxury.

1169
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,693
The secret,

1170
01:24:51,737 --> 01:24:55,363
the secret is to
always wear a big, wide smile

1171
01:24:55,407 --> 01:24:58,617
and hide your real self,

1172
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,994
'cause if you don't,

1173
01:25:01,038 --> 01:25:04,748
if... if they see
who you really are,

1174
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:06,791
they will destroy you.

1175
01:25:06,836 --> 01:25:10,254
So you give them what they want,

1176
01:25:10,298 --> 01:25:12,923
your body, hide the rest.

1177
01:25:14,718 --> 01:25:18,011
And then one day
you look around,

1178
01:25:18,055 --> 01:25:22,641
and where is it,

1179
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:27,438
that poor little self
that you were protecting,

1180
01:25:27,482 --> 01:25:30,649
that troubled soul or
whatever you want to call it?

1181
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:33,610
It's gone because, sir,

1182
01:25:33,654 --> 01:25:38,157
like our DNA, our souls
are in every cell of our body.

1183
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,284
It's kind of a two-fer.

1184
01:25:40,328 --> 01:25:43,287
Sell your body, soul comes with.

1185
01:25:43,331 --> 01:25:45,831
Do you have any notion
of what I'm talking about?

1186
01:25:47,794 --> 01:25:50,253
No, you just want a confession.

1187
01:25:51,965 --> 01:25:54,590
That would be nice.

1188
01:25:54,634 --> 01:25:57,219
I didn't ask to play
their game,

1189
01:25:57,262 --> 01:25:59,887
but when I did,
I played it better, and I won.

1190
01:26:01,933 --> 01:26:06,185
So I confess
that whatever you think I did,

1191
01:26:07,981 --> 01:26:10,815
Probably did,

1192
01:26:10,858 --> 01:26:13,067
but if you want regret,

1193
01:26:13,111 --> 01:26:14,860
remorse,

1194
01:26:14,904 --> 01:26:16,905
it's gonna be
a little harder to come by.

1195
01:26:22,496 --> 01:26:25,037
Thanks for the money.
