1
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,700
- I was feeling free

2
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,700
I had the ringing of the sea
in my ears

3
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
And who else could I be?

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,300
I had the ringing of the sea
in my ears

5
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,200
And the pavement
rushing under me

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,700
Just drowning out
the passing of the years

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,300
And I said who-ooo-ooo

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,600
Who else do I need?

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,700
And without you

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,300
What else could I be?

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,700
What else do I need?

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, I guess I need
falling skies

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,100
And more apologizing
for the way I became

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,800
Windmills to fight with
stay up all night with

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,700
Just give me enough room
to hang

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,500
I was feeling free

17
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,400
I had the shining of the ocean
in my eyes

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,900
And who else could I be?

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,600
I had the shining of the ocean
in my eyes

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,900
See, I was blinded
by the very thing

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,800
On which my fragile
peace of mind relied

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,000
And without you

23
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,800
What else could I be?

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,000
- The pictures didn't
do it justice.

25
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,100
- Oh.

26
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,600
- I sense danger.
- It's fine.

27
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm fine.

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,900
- Were you carsick?

29
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,500
- Of course not
Of course I wasn't carsick.

30
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
That's

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
- Richard, I'm not sure
you fully understand

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,700
what you're walking into here.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,000
There are countless unknowns.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,500
- I can handle this, okay?

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Please, just give me
some credit

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,400
- There's gonna be crying.

37
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,800
- I'm having trouble believing
how great this is.

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,500
You comin'?

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Whoa!
Good Lord.

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,600
Claire.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,700
- Oh, poor thing.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,900
Well, at least it was quick.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,600
It's a clean thoracic tear.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
- We should give him
a proper burial.

45
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,400
I feel like I just lost
my bearings.

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,100
- Oh, thanks.

47
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,400
- Yeah.

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,500
Oh, this is charming.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Oh, the water works.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
Good.

51
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,100
I don't know if the stove works.

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,400
Maybe they have take-out menus.

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,500
- Ah, listen!

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,300
Come here, come here, come here.

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,200
There she is, the mighty sea.

56
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,800
Still in there.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,800
- Wow.

58
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,300
- That's so that's

60
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,300
I'm gonna look around.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
- Oh, they've got plenty
of towels.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,100
We didn't need to bring any.

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Oh, well.

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,300
The fuse box is in
the linen closet, Richard.

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,300
Oh, there's a skylight

66
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,400
Richard?

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,700
- The couch

68
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
could be a problem.

69
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,500
- Don't fixate.

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,200
- You're right

71
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,600
Wonderful, everything.

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,900
- Good, that's right

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You want to grab the luggage
out of the car?

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,300
I'll do it

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,600
- Phil Turley
is very concerned, Claire,

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,700
about the community's efforts
to protect the nesting grounds

77
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,300
of the native tern.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,900
As he should be.

79
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,200
- Listen, I put all
my numbers

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
on the top sheet
of that memo pad by the phone,

81
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,300
so if you want to tear that off
and tape it up somewhere.

82
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm in surgery from 9:00
till noon.

83
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,600
So I'll check in after that,
okay?

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,100
- Great, good.

85
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,900
- Are you sure you don't want
to rent a car?

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
- Didn't they say there was
a bike?

87
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,400
I'll dig it out of the garage.

88
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,300
It's ten minutes to town.

89
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,100
This will be ideal.

90
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,500
- Okay, it's up to you.

91
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,100
- So what does your schedule
look like for tomorrow?

92
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
- I'll start
at the very beginning.

93
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,800
That's a very good place
to start.

94
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,300
- Speaking of which...

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,900
Close your eyes.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay, you can open them.

97
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,500
- Oh.

98
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,700
- Mark just got one of these.

99
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,100
He said a five-year-old
could use it

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,800
- Richard, use your words.

101
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,100
- Actually, I was thinking
of writing on the Corona.

102
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,700
- Oh.

103
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,100
- No, but this is good.

104
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,400
No, this is
you're right

105
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
This is better.

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
- Yeah.

107
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Okay.

108
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,000
- Richard.

109
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,700
These fabrics.

110
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,000
- Oh, I talked to Peter
and Lucy,

111
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,300
and they said they might come
out the weekend of the 2nd.

112
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,900
- Great, great

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,300
Who?

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
- Peter and Lucy?

115
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,700
- Oh, good, yeah.

116
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
They're always fun.

117
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,100
- Yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,500
You didn't bring

119
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,100
you didn't bring him out here,
did you?

120
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
- What?
No.

121
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,800
No, of course not

122
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,500
- No. Okay.

123
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,100
All right

124
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,700
Have a productive week, okay?

125
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,100
- Save some lives!

126
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,200
ding!

127
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,200
beep!

128
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,500
- Hot wheels.

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,500
- Let go of me.

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
- Do you remember the time

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,300
that you ran over the neighbor's
guinea pig, Little Fluff?

132
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
- No, I do not

133
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,500
Now will you let me go?

134
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,400
- Look, we both know that you're
not equipped to deal

135
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,800
with your current circumstances.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,500
And until you prove otherwise,
I feel compelled to be on hand.

137
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,200
- Could you step aside?
I have things to do.

138
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,200
- I sense danger.

139
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,600
- Would you stop saying that?

140
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,400
- Be careful!

141
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,100
- Buh-buh-duh

142
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
Buh-buh-buh-duh

143
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
Buh-buh-duh

144
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,600
Buh-buh-buh-duh

145
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,200
Buh-buh-duh

146
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
Hmmm

147
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
- Why aren't you a cheerleader,
anyway?

148
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,200
- 'Cause I'm not

149
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,400
- Later.

150
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
- You could so easily
be a cheerleader.

151
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,100
- You could so easily drop dead.

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
- Ugh!

153
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,900
Oh, no!

154
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, it's not like that

155
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,200
Hand soap?

156
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,500
- No, it's for your wheels.

157
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,100
The squeaks drive me nuts.

158
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
It's a nice bike, though.

159
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,400
I used to have one of these
when I was your age.

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
So how come you're following me?

161
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,100
- I'm not

162
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,700
- Are too.

163
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,600
- I'm not

164
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm not

165
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,400
- Are too.
How come?

166
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,000
- Well, I was just
I kind of

167
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,000
I just moved into town.

168
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,600
And I need a babysitter.

169
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
I just thought you know,

170
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,900
I thought maybe you might know
somebody who

171
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,800
- Yeah, okay.

172
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,000
When do you need me for?

173
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,700
- Oh, um...

174
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,200
Friday night

175
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
6:00.

176
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,600
- Address and phone number?

177
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,200
- 18 Sag Harbor Road.

178
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,300
I don't know
the phone number yet

179
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,800
Sorry.

180
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,600
- All right,
I'll see you Friday.

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,100
- I'm Mister

182
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm Richard.

183
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,900
ding!

184
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,000
Merton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,900
Merton regarded his solitude
as something s

186
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,100
- Face it

187
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,300
You can't live without me.

188
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,300
- Do you mind?

189
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,600
I'm communing with nature here.

190
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,800
Why are you so incapable
of believing

191
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,700
I can do things perfectly fine
on my own?

192
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,300
- Because you never have.

193
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,200
- Excuse me?

194
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
- Oh, Richard, Richard, Richard.

195
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,100
How many times, huh?

196
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,500
Huh?
How many times?

197
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,400
"I'm gonna go through these
ballet lessons alone."

198
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
- Do not mock me.

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,400
- "I'm gonna, like, go through
the college years, like, alone."

200
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,600
- Okay, that

201
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,900
- "You know, I don't need you,
Captain.

202
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
I'm gonna resuscitate
my half-dead marriage alone."

203
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
- Zip it
You kindly zip it

204
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,800
- Please, for once in your life,
go it alone.

205
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,400
- Gladly!
Good day, sir.

206
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,900
- A good day.

207
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,800
- You just don't like it
because I'm on an upswing.

208
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,300
- Oh, my God.

209
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,600
- Merton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

210
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Merton?

211
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,700
Burton.

212
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,600
Milton?
Milton.

213
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Milton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

214
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,600
- Hey.

215
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,900
Sorry, I'm a little early.

216
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,800
- No, no problem.

217
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

218
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,500
- Oh, that's okay.

219
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,400
I forgot yours too,

220
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,600
but I was thinking
that it was Paul

221
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,300
or Steve or Dave, maybe?

222
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
- Richard.

223
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,200
- Oh, okay.

224
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,400
That works.

225
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,900
- Oh, here.

226
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,800
It's a Love-A-Lot for the kid.

227
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,100
- Oh, well...

228
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Actually

229
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,600
- Um, so you just moved here?

230
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
Where from?

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,700
- Just the city.

232
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,600
- Oh.

233
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,300
- Yeah, it's only temporary.

234
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,100
My wife Claire is at New York
Presbyterian.

235
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,700
She's a vascular surgeon.

236
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
- Oh, wow.

237
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
Is that her?

238
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,900
She's cute.

239
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,900
- Oh, yeah, that's the doctor.

240
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,200
- My parents went through
a trial separation once too.

241
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
- What?
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

242
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,600
That's not what's happening
here.

243
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,600
No, that's
no.

244
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
That's

245
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,300
No, is it?

246
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,200
- Well, you should probably
find out

247
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,100
- Huh.

248
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,000
- Is it sleeping, the baby?

249
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,400
- The thing about that baby is

250
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,500
are you thirsty?

251
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,100
- Um, no.

252
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,100
- Oh, look.

253
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,900
The baby is not here.

254
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,800
- What do you mean?

255
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,700
- Basically, I guess,

256
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,000
there is no baby...

257
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,800
as such.

258
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,500
- There's no kid?

259
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
- Nope.

260
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,000
- Well, shit

261
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,700
Then this will be easy.

262
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,600
So when do you think
you'll be home?

263
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,600
- Oh, 9:00, 9:30.

264
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,800
- Okay, I got a lot of homework.

265
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,100
So have fun.

266
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,800
- Okay.

267
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:18,800
- Only when the good
is unattainable

268
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:27,800
Do I start to feel like
I'm losing myself

269
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,500
And this deep secret
that hasn't come out yet

270
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
- Chickenshit

271
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,600
- Is buried down deep

272
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,900
With the rest

273
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't coerce you
into this one

274
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,400
Jealousy lay all
your spells to bed

275
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,700
I'll choose unloved instead

276
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,100
- "'Self-loathing
is an underrated form

277
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,400
"'of psychological checks
and balances:

278
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,800
"'never too high,
never too low,'

279
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,000
"thought Merton to himself

280
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,100
as he gazed into the rapidly
reddening bathwater."

281
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,900
Jesus.

282
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,600
- Lay all your spells
to bed

283
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,800
I'll choose unloved instead

284
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,700
- Don't say it

285
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,700
- Say what?

286
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,100
- I know what you're thinking.

287
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,100
- No, you don't

288
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,500
I was thinking about pantaloons.

289
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
- What are you doing?

290
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,700
- You ass!

291
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,600
How did you get in here?

292
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
- The door was open,

293
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,800
which is extremely unsafe,
by the way.

294
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
- You don't need to keep
checking up on me.

295
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,600
- Isn't this the guy you said
was following you?

296
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,600
Who does that?

297
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,800
- You do.

298
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,800
It's just babysitting.

299
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,300
- Where's the kid?

300
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,100
- He doesn't have a kid.

301
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
- Abby, this guy is a perv.

302
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,700
We got to get out of here now.

303
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,200
- Okay, he's a famous writer,
okay?

304
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,500
Get a life.

305
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,000
- You are my life.

306
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
You've got a problem with men.

307
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,900
- No, I have got
a problem with you.

308
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,300
- What about Bryce?
- What about him?

309
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,700
- He treats you like shit

310
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,700
- When?
- Always.

311
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000
- No.
- Yes.

312
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
- Shut up.

313
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
- Oh, you are not

314
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,400
- I'm not what?

315
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,400
- What are you doing?

316
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,200
- Making soup.

317
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
- You've known this stalker guy
five minutes.

318
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,400
You're already making him soup?

319
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,700
- I told you, Christopher.

320
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,900
He is a writer.

321
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,200
- I love you.

322
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,600
- What are you doing out here?

323
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,300
- I told her 9:00, 9:30.

324
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,900
- No, I mean what are you doing
out here with the girl?

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,100
- Nothing.

326
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,200
- That doesn't strike you
as odd somehow?

327
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,800
A babysitter?

328
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,400
- I'm under a lot of pressure,
okay, to produce.

329
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,800
People expect literature:

330
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
the doctor, my publisher.

331
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,900
I've got three months,

332
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,700
three months to crack
this thing.

333
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,000
- And the girl helps how?

334
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
- Was I popular in high school,
in retrospect?

335
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,900
- And the girl helps how?

336
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,600
- Do you have to question
every decision I make?

337
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,000
- Make better decisions.

338
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,200
- Just do the voice.

339
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,000
- Oh.

340
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh, now he needs me.

341
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,300
- At this juncture, yes.

342
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,000
- Juncture?
- Yes.

343
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,700
- Oh.
- Yes, just do it

344
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,400
When the world is in peril,

345
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,700
when evil surrounds you,

346
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,400
when danger is lurking,

347
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
who do you call?

348
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,900
Captain Excellent!

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,500
- I'm bolstered!

350
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,100
There's something out there
in the woods.

351
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
- Oh, my God.

352
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,000
The wolf.
Didn't you hear?

353
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,800
It escaped from the zoo
this morning.

354
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,500
- There's a zoo here?

355
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,600
No, I'm just

356
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,200
Well, whatever it is,
I won't let it get you.

357
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,100
Come on, there's soup.

358
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,000
- What?

359
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,400
- Yeah, I made soup.

360
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,000
I thought that you might
be cold.

361
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
What did you do tonight?

362
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,400
- I went to the shore,
did some thinking.

363
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,500
- Oh, for three hours
in the freezing cold?

364
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,100
- You made this?

365
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,100
- Yeah.

366
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
- How?

367
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,100
- I don't know.

368
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,800
A couple of carrots,

369
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,400
an onion, one of your beers.

370
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,600
Oh, I hope that's okay.

371
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,900
I just kind of helped myself.

372
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,100
- No, it's fantastic.

373
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,200
- Oh, well, you haven't even
tasted it yet

374
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,900
- No, no, no, I mean,
the fact of it is fantastic,

375
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,200
that you made something
from nothing.

376
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,400
- Oh, you can, you know,

377
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,900
kind of make soup
out of anything.

378
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,100
That's the great thing about it

379
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,000
Just whatever's left
laying around, you know.

380
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,600
You can take all the crap

381
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,300
that's rotting in your fridge
and throw out,

382
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,200
or you could toss it into a pot
and make soup out of it

383
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,500
So I go with soup.

384
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,800
Oh.

385
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,600
It's superb.

386
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,000
- Thank you.

387
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
- No, really.

388
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,100
It's excellent

389
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,900
- Do you remember the moment
when you realized

390
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,800
that soup didn't have
to come out of a can,

391
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
you know, like all manufactured,

392
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,300
that your chicken noodle
could kick

393
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,700
Campbell's chicken noodle's ass
any day of the week?

394
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,200
- I think I'm having
that moment right now.

395
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,700
Plus, it's very nutritious,

396
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,800
which is good.

397
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
- What what happened there?

398
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,300
- Oh.

399
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Sorry.

400
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,700
It's just
it's a boyfriend thing.

401
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,300
Just, um,

402
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,600
the bird kind of reminded me
of him.

403
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,100
He's chickenshit

404
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
- Oh.

405
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,500
Actually, it's not a chicken.

406
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,100
It's the North American
heath hen.

407
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,800
Related to the greater
prairie chicken,

408
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,500
but not technically a chicken.

409
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,400
- Oh.

410
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,700
- It's extinct now.

411
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,600
The last few lived out here

412
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,500
out on the nature preserve
at Camp Hero.

413
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,100
- Hmm.

414
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,300
I did not know that

415
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,700
- I'm not a birder or anything.

416
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,300
It's just, the last surviving
heath hen

417
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,100
is a character in...

418
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
- In what?

419
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
- That bird's just

420
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,700
it's the main character of this
book that,

421
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,000
you know, I'm attempting
to produce, to write,

422
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,800
finish.

423
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,100
Actually, to start.

424
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,300
Saying it out loud just sounded
kind of stupid.

425
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,400
- Well, there's Chicken Little,

426
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,200
you know, and Little Red Hen.

427
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,400
- Henny Penny.

428
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,800
- Yeah, exactly.

429
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,800
Exactly.

430
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh, you know, there's a lot
of books out there

431
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,200
about poultry.

432
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,800
- We should settle up.

433
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
- Okay.

434
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,700
- Is that about right?

435
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
- Actually, I'm $12 an hour.

436
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,800
- Oh, okay.

437
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,600
I only have a $10.

438
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,900
Do you have change?

439
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,300
- Let me check.

440
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,800
- So how come your boyfriend's
a chickenshit?

441
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
None of my business.

442
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,100
Sorry.

443
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,200
- No, he just

444
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,600
He just bugs.

445
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,800
You know, it's like when he's
with me, it's all,

446
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,300
"Oh, you know."

447
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,000
And when he's with his friends,
he's all, "Ugh, whatever."

448
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
It's just you know,
he's a fucking chickenshit

449
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,900
- Right

450
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
- Okay, so thank you.

451
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,700
- Mmm-hmm.

452
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,700
Thank you.

453
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,600
Can I ask you a quick question?

454
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,000
- Sure.

455
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
- Does this couch
make me look fat?

456
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
- I wouldn't sit there.

457
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,200
- Hmm.

458
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
- So okay.

459
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,900
Good luck with the chicken book.

460
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,600
- Same time next week?

461
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,100
- Um...

462
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay.

463
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,000
- You didn't tell me your name.

464
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
- Richard?

465
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,300
Richard.

466
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,800
- Are we separated?

467
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,200
- What?

468
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,000
- Is this a trial separation,
what we're doing?

469
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,900
- What makes you think that?

470
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,200
- I don't know.

471
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,500
Our separateness.

472
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,700
- Sweetie,
if we were separating,

473
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,300
you'd be the first to know.

474
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,500
- I guess.

475
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,500
- Well, we would have
discussed it

476
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,000
Trust me.

477
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,200
- Okay.

478
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,200
Whew, good.

479
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,500
It just moved.

480
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,100
- Well, that's not possible.

481
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,600
It's been boiled to death.

482
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,100
- Poor little Louie.

483
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,600
- Well, don't name it, Richard.

484
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,900
I mean, do whatever you want

485
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,300
No, don't
don't name your food.

486
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,700
Here.

487
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,700
- Oh.

488
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,700
- There.
Okay?

489
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
Hmm?

490
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,100
There you go.

491
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,100
Hmm?

492
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,700
- If only everything
in the world

493
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,800
could be covered in butter.

494
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,100
What a world that would be.

495
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,700
- I guess.

496
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,600
- What a buttery world.

497
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,500
- He any good?

498
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,400
- I don't know.

499
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,100
It's kind of wordy.

500
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,100
- So what does
the renderer render?

501
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,400
- I haven't gotten
to that part yet

502
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,000
- Well, let me know.

503
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,700
I'm sure it's something
brilliant

504
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,400
- What were you doing
in my gym class?

505
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,300
- Nothing.

506
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,100
- You think I didn't see you?

507
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,900
- I was just there
for moral support.

508
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,400
- I suck at volleyball.

509
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,500
- You do not

510
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,000
- I suck at everything.

511
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,500
No, you don't

512
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,700
You're fantastic
across the board.

513
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,400
- Would you just shut up?

514
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,200
- We never go out anymore.

515
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,800
- Look, you got to leave, okay?

516
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I'm meeting Bryce later.

517
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,600
- He's beneath you, you know.

518
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,700
- Why you got to wear
so much shit?

519
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,200
- 'Cause it's freezing in here.

520
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,800
Run the heater.

521
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,600
- You want to pay for the gas?

522
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,800
- Are you done?

523
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,700
Yeah.

524
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,500
See you later.

525
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,500
- Okay.

526
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,500
- Well, just go for it

527
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,100
- I'm...
I'm going.

528
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,000
Okay, well, he's dead now.

529
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,900
Why don't you go?

530
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,600
Damn it
It's your turn.

531
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,800
I don't know how you do this
all day.

532
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
I mean, there's so much
pressure.

533
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,300
- Well, it's just a game.

534
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,300
- I know.
- No one's dying here.

535
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,200
- Go ahead.

536
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
- We can play something else.

537
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,700
- No, it's fine.
It's you know.

538
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,300
- All right

539
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Let's see.

540
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,100
That one's on my side.

541
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,100
- Yeah.

542
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,200
Well, that was fun.

543
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,100
- Yes, it was.

544
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,300
- Fun-packed weekend.

545
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,900
- Okay, well,
have a productive week.

546
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,400
And I'll see you on the 15th.

547
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,300
- Yeah.

548
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,100
What?

549
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
You're standing.

550
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
Oh.

551
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,200
Really?

552
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,000
That's enough of that

553
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,700
You remember when you stuck
that dime up your nose

554
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,200
and tried to snort it
out your mouth?

555
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,600
The cowboy outfit for your
seventh grade school picture?

556
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,100
You remember?

557
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,600
The horny toads,
the hunger strike?

558
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
I cautioned you against
those decisions,

559
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
but you didn't listen to me,

560
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,200
which is fine,
'cause you were just a kid.

561
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,000
But now it's grow-up time.

562
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
The babysitter?

563
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,500
Bad, Richard.

564
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,100
Very, very bad, Richard.

565
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,600
That chair's gonna be a problem.

566
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,600
- Sakes alive.

567
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,900
- "Making the monkey.

568
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,700
"A humorous monkey is popular
in zoological gardens.

569
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,200
"For example, it is lovely
that you make a baby monkey

570
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,700
"with small paper and that you
put it on a mother monkey.

571
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Fold A, top right corner."

572
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,100
- Why origami?

573
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,700
Why now?

574
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,700
- I needed something to do
with my hands.

575
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,800
- I'm having trouble telling
which is the monkey

576
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,500
and which is the swan.

577
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,700
- Oh, that can't be all of them.

578
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,100
- No, no, there's a bunch more
in the truck.

579
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,000
- Oh, great

580
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Start bringing them in.

581
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,100
Horton r

582
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,500
- Richard, Richard,

583
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,100
for the love of God,
don't do this please.

584
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,000
Listen to me.

585
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
You're making a huge mistake.

586
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,500
You're going for it

587
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,800
- It's Abby.

588
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,300
My name.

589
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,700
Oh, you got rid of the couch.

590
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,100
- Yeah, the couch was a problem.

591
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,100
Um...

592
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,800
This is for you.

593
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,200
- Oh.

594
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,700
It's...

595
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,900
it's a fish.

596
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,800
A dead fish.

597
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,700
A whole dead fish.

598
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
- Yeah.

599
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,200
My dad fishes, like,
for a living.

600
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,000
It's a fluke.

601
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,900
- In what sense?

602
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,600
- It's called a fluke.

603
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,100
It's the water around here
is swimming with them.

604
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,000
- Ah, yeah.

605
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,000
So it's edible?

606
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,500
- Yeah.

607
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,400
- A fluke.

608
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,100
That's great

609
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,200
Thanks.

610
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,200
- So I read that book you wrote.

611
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,500
I hope that's okay.

612
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
- Reading my book?

613
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,400
Of course.

614
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,500
You may be one of the few.

615
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,000
- So are you going out tonight?

616
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,900
Out on the town?

617
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,200
- Uh, I don't know.

618
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,300
What do the people of Montauk
do on a Friday night?

619
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,700
- The Yardarm's totally dead.

620
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,700
So you'd probably like that

621
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,300
It's down by the harbor.

622
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,500
You can't miss it

623
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,900
- What did you think
of the book?

624
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,800
- I don't know.

625
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,700
What did you think of it?

626
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,100
- Me?
Oh, l

627
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,500
you know,
it's got its strengths,

628
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,700
got its moments.

629
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,600
I hate it

630
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,300
- You should probably
put that fish in the fridge,

631
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,600
'cause it'll stink up
the whole house.

632
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,300
Trust me.
I know.

633
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,500
What?

634
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,900
- Soup ingredients.

635
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,600
You know, if you feel like it

636
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,300
- You bought me a rutabaga.

637
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,300
- You're making this
too easy on me.

638
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,300
- Well, like I said, you know,
if you feel like it

639
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,500
No pressure.

640
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,100
- Your book was cool, actually.

641
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,400
It kind of blew me away.

642
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,800
- You planning on having
something to eat?

643
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,900
- Thanks, no.

644
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,700
homemade.

645
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,100
- Can't beat that

646
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,100
Another beer?

647
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,100
- Sure.

648
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,500
- So what brings you down
to the South Shore, then?

649
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,300
- A book.

650
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,600
A bird.

651
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,700
A book about a bird.

652
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,100
Research work, you know.

653
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,100
- My wife makes
a good chowder.

654
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,400
Not so much a clam chowder
like you'd expect,

655
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,600
more of a corn chowder.

656
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,900
- My Lorraine, she can shuck
a dozen oysters

657
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,100
in a minute and a half.

658
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,700
- Local Malpeque oyster?

659
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,000
- That's the one.

660
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,600
- My wife invented and patented
a lifesaving polymer shunt

661
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,600
- Shunt, you say?

662
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,700
- Shunt

663
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,700
So there's our heath hen,

664
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,700
hunkered down at Camp Hero.

665
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,600
- Just down the road here?

666
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,100
- Yep.
As game warden

667
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,000
- The Alfred guy.

668
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,000
- Yeah, correct

669
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,900
Alfred is his actual name.

670
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,300
In the book, I am going
to call him Horton or Morton.

671
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,400
Anyway, so he's brought
his flock of heath hens

672
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,100
back from the brink
of extinction.

673
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,300
- Awesome.

674
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,900
- I mean, he was down to 11
of them.

675
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,100
11, you know, but now with care,
and dare I say, love,

676
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
and incubators,

677
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,400
he's got 200.

678
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,700
And it's like the hen is saved.

679
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,000
- Safe, thank God.

680
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,300
- But because our story
is a tragedy,

681
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,700
you know what happens?
- What?

682
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,900
- Fire.

683
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
- No!
- Come on!

684
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,500
- Oh, yeah,
it sweeps across the preserve.

685
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,800
Of course, the heath hen,

686
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,900
not nature's most intelligent
bird to begin with...

687
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
- I hear ya.

688
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,600
- She just sits in her nest

689
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,300
You know, and she doesn't have
the sense to run

690
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
or fly or waddle.

691
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,700
You know,
when the fire runs out,

692
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
there's just five birds
remaining.

693
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,900
- Roast chicken.

694
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,600
- What happens to the five?

695
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,100
- They dwindle.

696
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,800
They dwindle

697
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,200
till there's just one left,
you know?

698
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Just one.

699
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Just one poor stupid
little thing.

700
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,400
You know,
it's just a stupid bird.

701
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,100
Just one.

702
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,300
It's a true story.

703
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,000
- Another round
for my friend here, Mike.

704
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,000
- Chicken shit

705
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,800
Oh, you did make soup.

706
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,100
Bless your heart.

707
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
Oh.

708
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,000
Mm, oh.

709
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,500
Such a small act of kindness,

710
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,100
but I can't tell you
what that means to me.

711
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,900
- Well, it's no big deal.

712
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,400
It's just soup.

713
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,000
- You are such a beautiful girl.

714
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,800
You are such a beautiful child.

715
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,800
- You're loaded.

716
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,300
- No, no, no, l

717
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,200
well, yes.

718
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
- Okay, I should go.

719
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,300
Since tonight
was a little longer

720
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,800
- You know what I am?

721
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,400
Let me tell you what I am,
just in case you're interested.

722
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,700
This is what I am.

723
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,900
- What?

724
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,800
- I am the only child
of an only child

725
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,100
and an only child.

726
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,400
And you know what that means.

727
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,100
- No cousins?

728
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,100
- It means I am the end
of a bloodline,

729
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,000
the last of my kind.

730
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,100
- Okay, well,
then have some kids.

731
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,900
Said the babysitter.

732
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,800
If you only knew.

733
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,500
- Okay.

734
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,400
Look, it's gonna be 60 bucks.

735
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,600
Okay, you should go to bed.

736
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,900
- I don't blame her, the doctor.

737
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,300
You know, she's just
she's a human mechanic.

738
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,100
You know, she's got her hands
inside human beings every day.

739
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,500
They're just machines to her,
you know.

740
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,800
They're machines that break,

741
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,200
like rot factories.

742
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,700
So how can you create life

743
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
when you know it's gonna
end up in death?

744
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,200
I mean, I get that

745
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,000
I get it!

746
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,400
I don't blame her, but

747
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,800
- Hey, I'm sorry.

748
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,300
- Eh.

749
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:49,300
See, she doesn't realize
that human beings are warm.

750
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,600
You know, they need contact

751
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,400
They need, you know

752
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,200
you are such a beautiful girl.

753
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,600
You are such a beautiful child.

754
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,600
thud!

755
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,700
No, no!

756
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
thud!

757
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,200
- Shit

758
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,100
- I'm gonna go.

759
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Why are men such dicks?

760
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,600
- Beats me.

761
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,500
- I just thought he was lonely.

762
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,100
- We're all lonely.

763
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,100
- I don't know.

764
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,300
Maybe I shouldn't have hit him.

765
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,000
- No, you definitely
should have.

766
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,200
Okay, would you rather?

767
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,000
- I don't want to play.

768
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,300
- Oh, come on.

769
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,500
Would you rather

770
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,100
have no TV for a year

771
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,800
or only be able
to watch The Golf Channel?

772
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,400
- Golf Channel.

773
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,000
- Yeah, me too.

774
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,300
At least it's TV.

775
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,300
Your turn.

776
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,400
- Okay, would you rather have
no friends or no parents?

777
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,100
- Claire?

778
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,800
- Richard, the couch is outside.

779
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,800
- Is it the 15th already?

780
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,100
- Are you okay?

781
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,100
- Yes, I am.

782
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,000
- There's soup in the kitchen.

783
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,100
Have you been making soup?

784
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,200
- I'll be right back.

785
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,800
- All right

786
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,800
You made the soup.

787
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,900
What babysitter?

788
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,800
Work is going great,
and I'm still not here.

789
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,600
Drink it up.

790
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,600
There you go.

791
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,600
Now get out there.

792
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,700
- You know the funny thing
about soup?

793
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,000
You get the ingredients
basically into the pot

794
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,900
along with the sauce and the
not the sauce.

795
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,300
The juice.

796
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,000
- You mean the broth?

797
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,800
- Right, right, and then
it just needs some cooking.

798
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,800
- Richard, is anything wrong?

799
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,200
I'm not

800
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,400
I'm concerned.

801
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,700
- Oh, well, thank you
for your concern, Claire.

802
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,400
Speaking of...
how are your patients?

803
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,300
Are they doing well?

804
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:52,100
And what are some
of their names?

805
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,200
- You know, you've got a bruise
right here.

806
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,100
- Oh, well, you know,
beaten down by life.

807
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,600
You know, winds of change.

808
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,400
Anyway, I want to do some
unloading of boxes

809
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,600
if you want to pitch in.

810
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,900
Then we can grab some brunch.

811
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,900
- Oh, no, Richard, no.

812
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,900
Are these all

813
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,100
- Oh, yes.

814
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,200
- Why?

815
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,700
Why would you do that
to yourself?

816
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,000
- Well, I just thought
as I embarked

817
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,500
on the writing of my second

818
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,900
my much anticipated
second novel,

819
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,200
that I should be reminded
of the remarkable,

820
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,000
I mean, really
quite noteworthy failure

821
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,100
of my first novel to sell
any copies whatsoever.

822
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,800
- Richard, I can't go
down this road with you.

823
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,000
- No, no, no, it's gonna be
very motivational, really.

824
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,100
- That was smooth.

825
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,100
- Hey, I got through it

826
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,600
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait

827
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,700
- What?

828
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,400
- My super senses
are telling me something.

829
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,600
- What?
- Yes.

830
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,500
I think the doctor
may be on to you.

831
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,600
- Oh, hush your mouth.

832
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,500
- Knock, knock.

833
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,500
Who's there?

834
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,100
- Shit

835
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,800
What do you want?

836
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,200
- I came to see
if you were okay,

837
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,200
'cause your head was

838
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,100
- It's fine.
I'm fine.

839
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,900
You need to go.

840
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,100
- What?

841
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,900
- You need to go now.

842
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,200
- Well, screw you too.

843
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,900
And you were the one
who came on to me,

844
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,900
by the way.

845
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,700
- What?

846
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,300
- Last night, asshole.

847
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,600
I was gonna apologize
for hitting you,

848
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,500
but forget it

849
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,100
You're a creep.

850
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,600
- Wait, Abby.

851
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:47,500
- The doctor's
out of her shower, FYI.

852
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,200
- Richard, who was that?

853
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,700
- Girl scout

854
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,400
- Oh, okay.

855
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,400
- Horton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

856
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,500
Horton, Norton,

857
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,200
Norwood.

858
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,100
Norwood regarded his solitude
as s

859
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,900
- How's it coming?

860
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,800
- Norwood regarded his solitude
as some

861
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,600
- Richard, what's this?

862
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,500
- It's a fluke.

863
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,600
- In what way?

864
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,900
- The fish.
It's called a fluke.

865
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,700
The water around here
is swimming with them.

866
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,300
- Oh, okay.

867
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,800
What were you planning
on doing with it?

868
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,900
- Do I have to have a plan?

869
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,300
Can't I just have a fish
in the house?

870
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,600
- Yes, fine.
I'm sorry.

871
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,000
- I thought we could cook it
then eat it

872
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,100
How's that?

873
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,800
- I guess I just hadn't caught
up with the fact

874
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,800
that you're a cook now.

875
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,900
- Okay, stop.
Stop it

876
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:50,900
You can stop.

877
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,100
Please stop now.

878
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,100
Stop it

879
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,300
Stop, stop, please!

880
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,800
Stop!

881
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,700
- Abby.

882
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,200
- Who the hell is that?

883
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,800
What the hell is she doing?

884
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,600
- I don't think I got a chance
to pay you the other night

885
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,400
How's $60?

886
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,400
- Keep it

887
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,100
You don't even
have a kid, so

888
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,800
- I think there was kind of
a misunderstanding

889
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,300
about some of my actions
or intentions.

890
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,600
I'm pretty sure
I said some things.

891
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,000
- Whatever.

892
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,000
I'm sure you're sorry
that you said all that stuff.

893
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,100
- I'm not sorry, actually,
about all that

894
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,200
What I'm sorry about is that
I was so abrupt at the house.

895
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,100
It was just

896
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,000
- Your wife was there.

897
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,300
Yeah, I figured that out

898
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,500
- Yes, it would have been,
you know,

899
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,500
awkward, you know?

900
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,300
- No, actually, I don't know.

901
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,900
- Well, Claire wouldn't really
understand our...

902
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,300
- Our what?

903
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,700
- Uh...

904
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,400
our friendship.

905
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,500
- Abby.

906
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,500
Come on.

907
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,800
We're out of here.

908
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
- Anyway, I wanted to let
you know that I respect you.

909
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,700
And is that Chickenshit?

910
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,900
Yeah.

911
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,000
- He's a good-looking guy.

912
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,200
- Yeah, he sure thinks so.

913
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,700
- You coming or what?

914
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,800
We're going to Turner's house,
smoke a jay.

915
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,700
- Yeah, just a minute.

916
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,500
- I'm Richard.

917
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,500
- Look, you said you wanted
to hang out more.

918
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
You in or out?

919
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,500
- It's okay, Abby.

920
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,200
I don't want to keep you
from your jay.

921
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,400
- Who's your friend
with the bike?

922
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,100
- Abby's been babysitting
for me.

923
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,600
How's Wednesday night?

924
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
- Sure.

925
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,200
- Damn, girl, move your ass.

926
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,700
- Sorry.

927
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,200
- What's wrong with you?

928
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,500
- Richard!

929
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,700
- Hello!

930
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,800
Don't you do it!

931
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,200
- Richard, are you here?

932
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,200
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

933
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,800
- Listen to me.

934
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,000
Hey, this won't end well.

935
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,400
Hey, how you doing?

936
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,400
- Come on.

937
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,400
I want to show you something.

938
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,200
- Great, okay.

939
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,200
I have a problem with my hands.

940
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,400
- What do you mean?

941
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,000
- They won't do
what I want them to do.

942
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,100
- What do you want them to do?

943
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,000
- Anything.

944
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,600
I don't know, something useful.

945
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,300
I want them to build something
or make something.

946
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,700
- Like what?

947
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,700
- Even Jesus, I mean,
he was a carpenter.

948
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,900
You know, it wasn't enough
for him to save mankind.

949
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,900
He needed a trade.

950
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,900
I'm a flimsy man,
an insubstantial.

951
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,900
- Well, compared to Jesus.

952
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,700
- I'm a paper man.

953
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,900
- No, you're a writer.

954
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,500
- Yeah, that's crucial.

955
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,600
- No, it is.

956
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,600
Here we are.

957
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,200
- Where?

958
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,600
- "It is possible
to be so at sea

959
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,000
"when life and land have
slipped under the horizon.

960
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,200
I quietly wish to never see
either again."

961
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,000
- Did I write that?

962
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,100
I wrote that

963
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,400
- Hold this.

964
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,800
- Abby?

965
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,900
Abby!

966
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,200
Come on.

967
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,100
Abby!

968
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,100
Abby.

969
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,700
Abby!

970
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,200
Jesus, what are you doing?

971
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,400
What are you doing?

972
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
- Come here.

973
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,600
- You cannot do this.

974
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,500
You can't do that

975
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,600
- It was me

976
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,400
that dared her
to go in.

977
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,700
It was really cold.

978
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,700
It was much,
much colder than today.

979
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,700
But you know, she wasn't gonna
turn down a dare.

980
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:48,200
We were like that

981
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,000
And I had eaten 23 oysters.

982
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,900
- Hmm.

983
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,500
- So I don't know

984
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,000
why she went in
in her clothes.

985
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,500
Um...

986
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:05,000
I guess maybe we thought
it would be warmer.

987
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,900
Kids.

988
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:17,300
And she was laughing,

989
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,100
and, you know, fine.

990
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,900
And then she was...

991
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,100
And then she was gone.

992
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:38,400
Just under and gone.

993
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:43,200
And I just stood there.

994
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,900
And then a couple hours later
my mom came

995
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,100
and found me.

996
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,600
And I guess, you know,

997
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,900
I was waiting for her
to swim back in.

998
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:03,600
But she never did.

999
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,500
- How old?

1000
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,800
- Same age as me.

1001
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,800
We're twins.

1002
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,900
- Oh.

1003
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,300
Oh, my God.

1004
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,500
- That was a long time ago.

1005
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,600
I like to go out there
every year

1006
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,700
and swim back to shore.

1007
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,500
You know, I like to feel
the cold.

1008
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:32,200
- It must have

1009
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,500
I don't know what to say.

1010
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,800
- So we're both only children.

1011
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,000
- That was our thing every year,

1012
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,800
and you know it

1013
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:08,900
And you take that guy out there
on this day.

1014
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,000
He didn't even know her.

1015
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,400
- I know.

1016
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,500
- Remember when I was the only
one that would talk to you

1017
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,100
for a long time?

1018
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,700
- I know, but

1019
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,700
- He doesn't love you.

1020
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,500
If that's what you think,
you're wrong.

1021
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,500
- What do you want me to say?

1022
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,500
- I could so move
to California.

1023
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,600
You shouldn't just assume

1024
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,000
I'll always be around,
'cause one day

1025
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,200
maybe I won't

1026
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,800
- Stop it

1027
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,800
- Is that what you want?

1028
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,900
- I don't have much of a story,
do I?

1029
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,500
- It's all relative, I suppose.

1030
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,500
- Exactly.

1031
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,700
Other people seem
to have had events.

1032
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,900
Things have happened to them,

1033
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,100
life-altering occurrences.

1034
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,300
- I used to do things.

1035
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,300
Remember?

1036
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,500
- This isn't about you.

1037
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,200
- Amazing things.

1038
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,000
What do you want me to say?

1039
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,200
- I don't know.

1040
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,700
- No, no, no, no.

1041
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
Tell me what you want me to say,
literally,

1042
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:21,200
'cause, frankly, at this point,
I got nothing.

1043
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,000
- But you have touched
several lives, Richard,

1044
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:28,900
through your work.

1045
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's not about your happiness

1046
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,200
but the happiness you've brought
to others.

1047
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,300
- Hey, look,
it's the fund-raiser

1048
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,100
for the children's hospital
tomorrow night.

1049
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,400
And I was thinking of donating
that bottle of wine,

1050
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,700
the '71 ChateauPetrus.

1051
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,900
I know we were saving it
for a special occasion,

1052
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,900
but, well,
it's for a good cause.

1053
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,200
So what do you think?

1054
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Richard, did you drink
that wine,

1055
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,900
that $5,000 bottle of wine?

1056
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,200
It's not in the rack.

1057
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,900
It was for the children.

1058
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,300
Will you call me, please?

1059
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,500
- Come in.

1060
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:26,900
- Whoa.

1061
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,800
Check out the couch.

1062
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,300
- You like?

1063
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,200
- I made it with these.

1064
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,600
- All right!

1065
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,600
That's awesome.

1066
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:38,100
- Yeah, sit
sit, sit, sit, sit, sit

1067
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,900
- Uh!

1068
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,800
- Huh?

1069
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:44,600
- It's nice.

1070
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,300
- Oh, those
just ideas for titles.

1071
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,500
- For your new book?

1072
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,800
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool, what have you got?

1073
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,400
- Uh...

1074
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,700
Cloudscape,

1075
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,500
Death and Desolation,

1076
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,300
The Daffodil.

1077
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,600
- Memoirs of an Amnesiac,

1078
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,400
Bolero.

1079
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,900
- Bolero?

1080
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,400
- Okay.

1081
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,700
Ad Nauseam,

1082
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,000
Balm of Silence.

1083
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,500
No?

1084
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,200
Old Miss Ptarmigan's
Blackberry Wine?

1085
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,100
- Whoa.

1086
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,500
- Let's forget it

1087
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
Titles are impossible.

1088
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,500
- Paper Man.

1089
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,700
- You seem a lot more
interesting than me.

1090
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,300
- I'm not

1091
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,500
It just seems that way
because I have a dead sister.

1092
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,900
- Where you been all day?

1093
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,900
- I don't know.

1094
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,800
- Whatever.

1095
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,400
So the party's off this weekend.

1096
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,800
Turner's mom busted him.

1097
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,200
- So what about the cove?

1098
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,500
- It's fucking cold out there.

1099
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,400
- Big deal.

1100
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,300
So the party's off.

1101
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,700
- What kind of party?

1102
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,000
- What do mean
"What kind of party?"

1103
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,700
A fucking party.
- Just nothing.

1104
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,800
Just some friends hanging out

1105
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,100
- You could use my place.

1106
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,700
- What?

1107
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,700
- Seriously?

1108
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,600
- Yeah, why not?

1109
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,300
This weekend's not so good.

1110
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,400
My wife's back.

1111
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,200
But you know,
we could do next week.

1112
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,300
Friday?

1113
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,300
- Friday is cool.

1114
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,200
- Really?

1115
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,700
- Yeah, I'll get a keg.

1116
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,500
- Nice!
Nice.

1117
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,600
- What else do you guys need?

1118
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,100
Appetizers, you know,
paper plates and stuff?

1119
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,900
- No, no, no.

1120
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,100
We're okay.

1121
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,100
We've got it covered.

1122
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,300
- Great, we're on.

1123
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,400
- Righteous.

1124
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,500
Thanks, man.

1125
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,100
- You didn't have to do that

1126
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,100
- Ah, it'll be fun.

1127
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,400
- Richard!

1128
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,200
Richard?

1129
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,200
Richard, please.

1130
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,800
- Hi.

1131
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,400
When the world is in peril,

1132
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,600
when evil surrounds you,
when danger

1133
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,600
Okay.

1134
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,900
- Richard, help me.

1135
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,400
- You don't like it?

1136
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,900
- All the furniture is outside.

1137
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,100
And what the hell is this?

1138
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,700
- You seem disappointed,
going off your body language.

1139
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,100
- You don't pick up the phone
once this week.

1140
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,500
You don't call me once.

1141
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:04,500
I drive all the way out here,
and there's this.

1142
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,700
Richard, say something.

1143
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,200
What's this?

1144
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,600
- What's what?

1145
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,200
- This.
Whose is this?

1146
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,200
- Will you just tell her?

1147
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,900
- Claire?

1148
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,800
- Yes?

1149
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,300
- Are we unhappy,

1150
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,300
or are we just pretending
to be unhappy?

1151
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,500
- What do you mean?

1152
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,000
- Are we just pretending
to be unhappy

1153
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,100
to add drama to our lives

1154
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,500
so that we seem somehow
more substantial?

1155
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,500
I mean, think about it

1156
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,500
Our lives
are embarrassingly easy.

1157
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,800
We've got plenty of money.

1158
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,900
We got friends.

1159
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Well, you've got friends.

1160
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,600
There are people out there

1161
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,800
who have real problems,
you know,

1162
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,200
real reasons to be unhappy.

1163
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,900
I mean, I could be a coal miner

1164
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,800
dying of black lung
or something.

1165
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,100
You could be a Cincinnati
crack whore on food stamps.

1166
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,500
- What?
- I don't know.

1167
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,700
Doesn't it feel like
we're faking it,

1168
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,300
our unhappiness?

1169
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,300
- No.

1170
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,100
No, it's real.

1171
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,800
It's very real.

1172
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,800
I'm going home now.

1173
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,000
I think you think
this is still charming.

1174
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,700
We're not 23 anymore.

1175
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,200
You need to pull it together.

1176
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,800
Pick up the phone this week.

1177
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,600
And bring the fucking furniture
in from the lawn.

1178
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,000
- Norwood regarded his solitude
as something

1179
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,400
Norwood, Norman, Richmond?

1180
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,200
Richmond, Richmond.

1181
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,000
- Richmond regarded his solitude
as something

1182
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:15,900
Ew!

1183
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,800
Richmond.

1184
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,700
Hitchmond.

1185
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,200
Shmichmond.

1186
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,200
- Richmond regarded his solitude
as something...

1187
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,800
- Unbearable!

1188
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,600
- Richmond regarded his

1189
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,000
- Unbearable!

1190
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:45,200
- Richmond regarded his solitude
as something unbearable.

1191
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,200
- Ptoo!

1192
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,100
Come on.

1193
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,100
Scalpel.

1194
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,700
- No, you're starting too high.

1195
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,800
You need to go down at the base
of the chin.

1196
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:28,700
- Oh.

1197
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,500
And then cut up from there.

1198
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,700
Good.

1199
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,300
Careful, careful, careful.

1200
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,200
Let me help you.

1201
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,100
All right
Ready?

1202
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,700
- Yeah.

1203
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,200
- And there.

1204
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,100
Good, good, good, good.

1205
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:53,100
Okay, would you rather
always walk backwards

1206
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,600
or stub your toe every time
you took a step?

1207
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,000
- Why would I want to do either?

1208
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:57,900
- It's a game.

1209
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,200
Just pick one.

1210
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,700
- Ah!

1211
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:05,100
- Oh, drop that in the pan.

1212
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:06,900
Beautiful.

1213
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,900
You are really good at this.

1214
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,300
- My wife reattached
a leg today.

1215
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,100
- Oh.

1216
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,600
- Maybe I should have been
a fishmonger.

1217
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,400
I could have, you know,
mongered some fish.

1218
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,800
- Okay, which one is it?

1219
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,000
Is it walk backwards
or stub your toe?

1220
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
- Well, could I just design
a special kind of shoe

1221
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,900
- Mm-mm. No.

1222
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,300
Oh, wait Here.
Flip that in a minute.

1223
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,700
Gently, gently, gently.

1224
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,600
- I guess I would
walk backwards.

1225
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,000
I'm not good with pain.

1226
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,900
You?

1227
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
- I like to see where I'm going.

1228
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:46,100
Okay, come here.

1229
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,200
You hold this end.

1230
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,700
- Ahh, paper men.

1231
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,400
- You know, for your book.

1232
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,100
- Oh, yes!

1233
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,000
Oh.

1234
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,600
I got something for you too.

1235
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,700
Yeah, close your eyes.

1236
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,300
- Oh!

1237
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,400
A camel.

1238
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,700
A peacock.

1239
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,000
- It's the swan,

1240
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,700
the beautiful, graceful swan.

1241
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,300
- Oh, sorry.

1242
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,500
Aw.

1243
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,800
- And I know
what it means to you

1244
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,800
And I know
what it means to you

1245
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,400
And I know
who I want to be

1246
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,300
- Come in.

1247
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,400
- Whoa.

1248
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,300
Oh.

1249
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,700
- We look good.

1250
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,700
- Yeah.

1251
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,600
Wow.

1252
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,700
You really went all out

1253
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,100
- Yeah, too much?

1254
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,700
- No, mm-mm.

1255
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,900
No, it looks great

1256
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:24,800
Party town.

1257
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,300
- Mm-hmm, the keg's in here.

1258
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,200
And I put the hors d'oeuvres
in the kitchen.

1259
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,500
I think it will flow well
that way.

1260
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,400
- Yeah, oh.

1261
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,400
That's a pinata.

1262
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,400
- Yeah, I went for the donkey.

1263
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,200
You know, go classic.

1264
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,500
You don't really
do parties much, do you?

1265
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,500
- No, I'm a little nervous.

1266
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,400
Well, relax.

1267
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,700
It will be fun.
- Okay.

1268
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,800
No.

1269
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:50,700
Hey.

1270
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,500
- Hey.

1271
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,400
- Shit

1272
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,300
- Yeah, I know.

1273
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,000
- Where's the freak?

1274
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,300
- Don't be an asshole.
- What a dickweed.

1275
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,300
- Hey, Bryce.

1276
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,600
What's up, man?

1277
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,900
- Where do I put these?

1278
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,200
- Kitchen.

1279
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,200
- What about the box?

1280
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,200
- Whatever, man.

1281
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,600
Whatever feels right, you know.

1282
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,100
Mi casa, you know.

1283
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,700
- What?

1284
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,300
Where's the cups?

1285
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,100
Nice.

1286
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,600
- Hey, welcome to party central.

1287
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,500
Come on in.

1288
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,200
That's it

1289
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,100
Hey, what's
hey.

1290
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,300
What grade are you guys in?

1291
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,900
Wow
oop, I'm sorry.

1292
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,100
Somebody wants to party.

1293
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,400
What's up?

1294
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,300
Hey, come on in.

1295
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,600
Let me see some ID.

1296
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:52,500
I'm kidding.

1297
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,600
Hey!

1298
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,400
Hey, hey.

1299
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,800
Having fun, huh?

1300
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,100
What's happening?

1301
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,700
All right, line up.
Get 'em up here.

1302
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,800
- Stop dicking around.

1303
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,100
- Watch this.

1304
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,700
Drink, drink, drink!

1305
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,600
Whoo, whoo, ooo, ooo!

1306
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,600
High school for me was a time
of self-discovery.

1307
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,600
There you go.

1308
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,500
When I look back on it

1309
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:55,400
though, got to say,
wouldn't want to be 17 again.

1310
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,600
- We're 15.

1311
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,900
- Ah.

1312
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,900
Okay.

1313
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,600
- Oh, what?

1314
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,400
- Come on.

1315
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,400
- I'll take you to a place
that you've never been before

1316
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,000
Come on,
don't stop

1317
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,500
- Oh, sorry.

1318
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,800
- Dude, do you mind?

1319
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,300
- What are you doing?

1320
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,200
- What?

1321
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,300
- What the fuck are you doing?

1322
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,300
What about Abby?

1323
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,900
- What about Abby?

1324
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
- You don't do this to her.

1325
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,900
You don't do this
to that little girl.

1326
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,900
- Mind your own business,
you fucking pervert.

1327
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,300
- Chickenshit

1328
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,800
- What did you call me?

1329
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:35,800
- Chickenshit bastard.

1330
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,900
- You don't talk to me
like that

1331
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,100
Who the hell are you?

1332
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,400
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1333
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,500
You don't talk to me like that,
you fucking freak.

1334
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,300
- You think you can threaten me?
You're a child.

1335
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,800
- I'm a child, huh?

1336
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Is that what I am?

1337
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,900
- Bryce, get the fuck
off of him.

1338
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,100
What are you doing?
Stop it

1339
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,400
Are you okay?

1340
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,000
- What's the deal?
What's the deal here?

1341
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,400
You fucking him?
- Stop it, Bryce.

1342
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,400
- Seriously,
are you fucking her?

1343
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,400
- No.

1344
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,700
- I don't give a shit

1345
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,700
He can have her.

1346
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,700
She's fucking crazy anyway.

1347
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,200
Why don't you go back
to the looney bin

1348
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,600
where you belong?

1349
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,900
And take him with you.

1350
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,400
- Get the fuck out

1351
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1352
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,400
- Get the fuck out now!

1353
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,600
Go!

1354
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:20,900
What the fuck are you
looking at?

1355
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,300
Get out of here.
Party's over.

1356
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:32,300
- Chickenshit is an asshole.

1357
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,200
- Yeah.

1358
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,000
- Great party.

1359
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,100
- Yeah.

1360
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:51,200
- I love you.

1361
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:55,200
- What?

1362
01:15:55,100 --> 01:16:01,900
- Not in any inappropriate way,

1363
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:07,400
nothing that's not,
you know, decent or

1364
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:12,400
I just find when I examine
my heart

1365
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:18,400
I find...

1366
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,300
I think that there's love
there...

1367
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,900
For you.

1368
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,900
Yeah.

1369
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,500
I love you.

1370
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,300
- It was...

1371
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,300
It wasn't really a looney bin.

1372
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,700
It was...

1373
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:57,000
I mean, I was only there
for a couple months,

1374
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,900
you know, just until I...

1375
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,300
My parents thought..

1376
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,400
I don't know.

1377
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,800
I never told them.

1378
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:24,000
I never told anyone.

1379
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,300
It was a pact

1380
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,900
Me and Amy

1381
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
were both supposed to go

1382
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,500
into the water,
and she did it

1383
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,300
And I swam back.

1384
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:02,400
I swam back.

1385
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,900
I couldn't

1386
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,100
I don't know what we were
so unhappy about

1387
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:19,800
I mean...

1388
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:24,500
what could we have been
so unhappy about?

1389
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,400
Eight

1390
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:37,500
I guess you're too young to know
that you can get over anything.

1391
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:20,800
- He's always made
poor decisions.

1392
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,300
- Same with her.

1393
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,200
- You feel helpless.

1394
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,700
How long you been with her?

1395
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,400
- Since she was eight

1396
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,400
You?

1397
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,100
- Oh, Christ

1398
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,800
That's got to be over 40 years.

1399
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,200
Second grade.

1400
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,200
- Isn't he a little old for you?

1401
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,400
- I keep telling him that

1402
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,500
He never listens.

1403
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,000
- They never do.

1404
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,200
- No.

1405
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,600
- What's your gig?

1406
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,700
- I've pretty much done it all.

1407
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,800
Battled monsters under the bed,
been a cheerleader,

1408
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:11,700
confidant

1409
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,700
These days, it's a bit of a
mystery, to tell you the truth.

1410
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,600
You?

1411
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,700
- I'm crazy in love with her.

1412
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,000
Tough one.

1413
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:22,500
- Yeah.

1414
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,300
It's been all right

1415
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,500
I think she's almost done
with me.

1416
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,000
- Good.

1417
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:29,900
Great

1418
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:33,300
Get out while you can.

1419
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,800
I tell you, they open the door,
you run.

1420
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,000
You don't want to end up
like me.

1421
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,900
- Guess not

1422
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,800
- Captain Excellent

1423
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,600
- Christopher.

1424
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,000
Nice to meet you.

1425
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,800
- See you around.

1426
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,800
- Oh.

1427
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,700
- What? What?
What? What?

1428
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,800
- You son of a bitch!

1429
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,600
You son of a bitch!

1430
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,800
- Don't overreact here.

1431
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,300
- Shut up.

1432
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,000
Don't tell me how to react
- It's not like that

1433
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,600
- Shut up!

1434
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,200
What is this, Richard?

1435
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,300
What
who is that?

1436
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,700
Who the fuck is that?

1437
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,400
- She's the babysitter.

1438
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,300
- Get out

1439
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:08,200
Get out

1440
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,000
Get out!

1441
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,400
- Hi, Lucy.

1442
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,500
Hi, Peter.

1443
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,500
- Hi.

1444
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,000
Claire, we'll just be

1445
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,800
- I didn't sleep
with the babysitter,

1446
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,100
if that's what you're thinking.

1447
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,200
- Oh, that's so comforting.

1448
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:27,600
Why do we even have
a babysitter?

1449
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,000
- It's just a kegger, Claire.

1450
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,100
That's all.

1451
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,300
- Just a kegger?

1452
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,900
And with whom exactly
did you have a kegger?

1453
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,300
- Just some kids
from the high school.

1454
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,700
- Richard, just stop.

1455
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,000
None of this is okay.

1456
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,100
- Okay.

1457
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,200
- You knew we were
coming this weekend.

1458
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,700
Why are you doing this?

1459
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,300
- I've been at a bit of a loss.

1460
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,600
- That's a bullshit answer.

1461
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,000
- I've been floundering,

1462
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,400
and Abby has been

1463
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,200
- What?
Abby's been what?

1464
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,800
- A friend.

1465
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:54,900
- For God's sake.

1466
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,300
That's not a friend;
that's a child.

1467
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,300
You have friends.
- No, I don't

1468
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,100
- Do think that was a chipmunk
that we hit?

1469
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,400
- I think they hibernate.
- Yeah.

1470
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,100
- 'Cause you don't know how
to relate to other human beings.

1471
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,800
Yeah, you isolate yourself.

1472
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
- Oh, you could talk.

1473
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,000
- What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

1474
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,500
- You can be cold, Claire.

1475
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,500
- Let's just maybe
get out of here.

1476
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,400
Can we just get out of here?
Can we leave this area?

1477
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,100
- What do you mean by that?

1478
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,100
- I don't know
if it's your profession or what

1479
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,300
But it's made you hard.

1480
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,600
- I can't
I don't accept that

1481
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,200
- I wanted to have a baby.

1482
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,500
- Is that what
this is all about?

1483
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,200
- We could have had a baby,
Claire.

1484
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,700
Why didn't we have a baby?

1485
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,700
- Why?
Because you are a baby!

1486
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,400
You're an infant

1487
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,700
You still have
an imaginary friend.

1488
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,300
- I just wanted
a little warm thing,

1489
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,300
something simple
I could start with,

1490
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,300
a single relationship with
a person that was new and pure,

1491
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,700
where I could be me
and they could be them,

1492
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,400
and that was all
that was expected.

1493
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,100
And we could build this world

1494
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,800
where there was someone else
other than me

1495
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,200
to think about and be about,

1496
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:04,200
the relief of being able to give
the world to someone else

1497
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,200
and just let it be theirs,

1498
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,000
let them have their turn,

1499
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
so it doesn't end with me.

1500
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,600
- Well, that's all you.

1501
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,900
Where do I come in?

1502
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,100
- What do you mean?

1503
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,900
God, you're the mother.

1504
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,400
- Uh, I'm so sorry, you guys.

1505
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,000
But we're gonna go.

1506
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,100
We're just gonna go.

1507
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,100
- B&B just anywhere?

1508
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,000
Anywhere.

1509
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,700
- I'm sorry.

1510
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,200
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1511
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,900
- We're just gonna
- Okay, I'll walk you out

1512
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,500
- We should all go on a cruise
or something.

1513
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,100
- Okay.

1514
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,900
- Take care.

1515
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,400
- All right, if we're gonna do
this, let's

1516
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,200
all right, by the way,
what is she, like, 13, 14?

1517
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,500
Let's at least get
our facts straight, though.

1518
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,600
Okay, it was you, Richard.

1519
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,100
You didn't want to have a baby.

1520
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,200
You weren't ready.

1521
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,700
So that little fuzzy
fucking speech

1522
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,400
my friends had to hear
was bullshit

1523
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,400
And now I'm
I can't

1524
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,300
So I guess I'm the bad guy.

1525
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,300
- No, not the novel.

1526
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,400
Look, I'd rather you didn't

1527
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,300
- What is this?

1528
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,600
What is this?

1529
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,000
- That's it

1530
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,600
- After all this time out here,

1531
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,700
this is it?

1532
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,200
This?

1533
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,400
Maybe if you'd spent
more time working

1534
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,400
instead of fucking
the babysitter

1535
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,700
- No.

1536
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,300
- You're useless.
- Yes.

1537
01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,300
- You're totally useless.

1538
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,800
- Yes, I am.

1539
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,100
- What is wrong with you?

1540
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:07,600
- I don't know what to do
with my hands!

1541
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:20,000
Jen and my sister
and Liv all envied me.

1542
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,300
I had the one who made me laugh.

1543
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,300
What happened?

1544
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,400
I don't know what happened.

1545
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,600
- You stopped laughing.

1546
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,400
- Help you?

1547
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,200
- Yeah, I came to pay
my respects.

1548
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,300
- Sorry?

1549
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,300
- The heath hen,
the North American heath hen.

1550
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,600
This is where
the last one lived, died.

1551
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,200
- Oh.

1552
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:43,200
I wouldn't know anything
about a heath hen.

1553
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,100
But you're welcome
to look around.

1554
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,300
We've got several varieties
of plover.

1555
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,000
- Thank you.

1556
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,800
So this is what the end
of something looks like.

1557
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,600
- The world went on, Richard.

1558
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:18,800
- But never the same.

1559
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,500
Who knows how she might have
changed things

1560
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,700
with her just being here,
the ripple effect

1561
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,100
- And if that chicken
hadn't died out,

1562
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,500
you'd be perfectly
well adjusted.

1563
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,500
- Maybe.

1564
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,800
- Doubtful.

1565
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,700
- Instead,
I'm a childless loser.

1566
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,300
I'm condemned to oblivion,
Captain,

1567
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,000
just like our little hen.

1568
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,200
It's time for you to go.

1569
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,900
- No.

1570
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,500
- You know what I'm saying,
Captain.

1571
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,500
I mean,
go and never come back.

1572
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,300
- I'm not ready.

1573
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,400
- It doesn't matter.

1574
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:06,600
You can't help me anymore.

1575
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,400
The doctor's right

1576
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,000
- But you'll be all alone.

1577
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,100
- Yes.

1578
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,100
Last of my kind.

1579
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:24,200
Okay.

1580
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,700
Do the voice

1581
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,700
one last time.

1582
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,900
Please.

1583
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,800
- When the world is in peril,

1584
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:48,400
when evil surrounds you,

1585
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,900
when danger is lurking...

1586
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,600
Who do you call?

1587
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,100
- Captain Excellent

1588
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:35,400
- I wish I had
a really amazing

1589
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,500
fucked-up father like him.

1590
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,800
- Captain.

1591
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,500
Richmond regarded his solitude

1592
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,800
Merton regarded
Horton regarded

1593
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,500
Richmond?

1594
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,800
Richmond?

1595
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:44,500
Richard.

1596
01:32:54,900 --> 01:33:01,400
Richard regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

1597
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:40,600
- I had this dream last night

1598
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,900
And you were in it

1599
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,400
- Oh, was I interesting?

1600
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,800
- You were you.

1601
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,900
You're leaving, aren't you?

1602
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,600
- Yeah, you know,

1603
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:04,800
'cause of the situation.

1604
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,600
- Yeah.

1605
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,000
I figured.

1606
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:18,400
You know,
spring is my favorite time,

1607
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,800
'cause summer people
aren't here yet

1608
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:24,000
It's not so fucking cold.

1609
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:26,800
- Yeah.

1610
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,900
Um, I made you something.

1611
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
- That's the swan.

1612
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,900
The beautiful, graceful swan.

1613
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,400
It's
Richard, it's perfect

1614
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,200
- Yeah, well...

1615
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,000
- Thank you.

1616
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:12,200
- It seems like we were
just getting started.

1617
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,600
- Here.

1618
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:23,300
- Got to find a way
back home

1619
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:45,000
- Okay.

1620
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:54,500
- Got to find a way
to get home strong

1621
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:59,400
Got to find a way back home

1622
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,500
- Got to find a road
that brings me back soon

1623
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,100
Got to find a way back home

1624
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,700
Got to find a way
to get home strong

1625
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:22,100
Got to find a way back home

1626
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:48,200
- Never wanted
to feel this way

1627
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:52,600
I never wanted
to feel so sad

1628
01:36:54,600 --> 01:37:02,700
- Never wanted
to feel this way again

1629
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:10,700
- Okay.

1630
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,800
- I'm a horse's ass.

1631
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,100
- Yes, you are.

1632
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,500
- I'm sorry.

1633
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,800
I'm gonna need some help
getting this couch in.

1634
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,100
- Got to find a way
to get home strong

1635
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,500
Got to find a way back home

1636
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,400
Richard regarded his solitude
as something sacred,

1637
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,900
as a well-earned
badge of honor,

1638
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:42,100
a cloak to be worn
to ward off life,

1639
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:44,800
as his safety.

1640
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:47,200
Solitude is who he was.

1641
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,000
This caused those in his life

1642
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,900
to view him
with a barely veiled contempt.

1643
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,500
Richard was certain
that he was not liked,

1644
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,000
which is hard on a man.

1645
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,200
Maybe it was because
he gave nothing

1646
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,400
that he received nothing
in return.

1647
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:04,800
In any case, his situation
had become intolerable.

1648
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,500
The closest things
he had to friends

1649
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:09,100
were either imaginary
or extinct.

1650
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,000
Richard had reached a point
in his life

1651
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,700
where this was no longer
enough.

1652
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,500
And then he met a girl,

1653
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,200
and she was warm,
and she was sad,

1654
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:24,000
and she was maybe lonely
in a way

1655
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,900
that reminded him of himself.

1656
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,500
She'd lost things that a girl
should never have lost.

1657
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:35,200
And she knew things,
and she taught him.

1658
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,400
And Richard thought,

1659
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:42,800
"Maybe this is what friendship
feels like.

1660
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,200
Maybe."

1661
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,200
It was just a glimpse.

1662
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,900
They'd barely begun, really.

1663
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,600
But in those long
few winter days,

1664
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:08,200
she'd given him so much,

1665
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:11,400
enough so that Richard
could go on.

1666
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,800
And what had he given her?

1667
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:25,900
Just a few words on a page.

1668
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:30,300
Not much, perhaps.

1669
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:35,200
But for Abby,
he hoped it was enough.

1670
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,800
- Got to find a way
to get home strong

1671
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:58,700
Got to find a way back home

1672
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,100
Got to find a light
to guide me home

1673
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:13,400
Got to find a way back home

1674
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,200
- Okay.

1675
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,500
- Got to find a way
back home

1676
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:02,400
- I broke the door

1677
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:08,700
I broke the furniture

1678
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:15,000
I painted pictures

1679
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:22,700
Did it for you

1680
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:28,900
Oh, ho

1681
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,300
Oh, oh

1682
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:40,400
I said good-bye

1683
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:46,600
To my whole family

1684
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:53,000
I hope they'll miss me

1685
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:59,700
As much as you

1686
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:34,800
- Driftwood finds its way
to sand

1687
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,200
So I'm sure that we will

1688
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:41,500
Recognize our landmark soon

1689
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:48,900
Wanderlust has lost
its shine

1690
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,400
It's left me cold,
and we're running out of time

1691
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:58,400
As we wonder how much longer
we can keep

1692
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:03,100
Our cars in tune

1693
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:08,200
And I only know that I'll
never be the boy wonder

1694
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:12,600
Yeah, I only know that I'll
never be the boy wonder

1695
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:17,600
It's too late
for that sort of thing now

1696
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:21,100
Maybe I'll just cut my losses
in this city

1697
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:27,900
That is how
we say "surrender"

1698
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:32,000
Driftwood finds
its way to sand

1699
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,300
And they're wondering
if they'll somehow

1700
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:39,300
see a grandson soon

1701
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:46,600
And I only know that I'll
never be the boy wonder

1702
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:51,600
It's too late
for that sort of thing now

1703
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,800
Maybe I'll just cut my losses
in this city

1704
01:44:54,800 --> 01:45:01,600
That is how
we say "surrender"

1705
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:34,700
Now if I get carried away,
I'll get plowed under

1706
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:39,300
So I can't forget that I'll
never be the boy wonder

1707
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:42,000
I'm too gray

1708
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:44,300
And I'm too beat down

1709
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:48,700
I could just come to my senses
then retire to some small town

1710
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,800
And just surrender

1711
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:58,800
Driftwood finds
its way to sand

1712
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,300
So I'm sure that we will

1713
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:08,400
Recognize our landmark soon
