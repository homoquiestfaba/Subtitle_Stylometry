Two grades right.

00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:32,040
Letting go in 10, 9, 8...

5
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,977
Ready to make
history, gentlemen.

00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:38,081
[robot clanking, whirring]

7
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,885
NFX is in position.

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,157
<i>Affirmative.
NFX is in position.</i>

00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:50,927
<i>Initiate excavation.</i>

10
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:52,861
Initiating excavation.

11
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,934
How we doing, Wilson?

12
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,903
Never better.
Thanks for asking.

13
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:05,073
<i>Careful.
Careful, Dr. Marietta.</i>

14
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,144
Tenth time's
the charm, Dr. Lopez.

15
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,382
The MEDUSA AI is not
fully uploaded to the NFX.

16
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,552
Still programming
field commands manually.

17
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:17,954
It takes time, gentlemen.

18
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,490
[alarm blares]

19
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:24,192
Really? Guys?

20
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,394
Guys, what's going on?

21
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,096
[loud whine]

22
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:31,067
[rapid beeping]

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,002
Dr. Lopez?

24
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:35,670
Wilson?

25
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,840
Damn it, guys.
What happened this time?

26
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:48,584
Wilson!

27
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:50,886
Can you hear me?

28
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:53,354
<i>Loud and clear.
I had a total shutdown inside.</i>

29
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:56,091
<i>I believe the shutdown was
triggered by Dr. Lopez,</i>

30
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:58,426
<i>but I can't reach him
to confirm.</i>

31
00:02:58,493 --> 00:02:59,961
Well, I'm not gonna
stay in here!

32
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:01,429
<i>Just hang tight.</i>

33
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:02,932
<i>Let me get over
to the mainframe.</i>

34
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:08,402
<i>Is MEDUSA acting up again or...</i>

35
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,840
Dr. Marietta?
Dr. Marietta?

36
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:11,874
[feedback whine]

37
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,644
Great.

38
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:24,752
[beeping]

39
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,055
Agh!

40
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:30,692
Abel, what happened?

41
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,094
I don't know.

42
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,864
One minute, I'm initiating
the platform response.

43
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,467
And the next, MEDUSA
starts seizing my computer

44
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,234
and creating
a directive profile separate

45
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,002
from operating the robot.

46
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:44,072
MEDUSA should be following me,
but instead... it's driving.

47
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,308
<i>System update received.
NFX is rebooting.</i>

48
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,843
Guys, what's going on?

49
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,913
All right. Did you take
the NFX robot offline

50
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,881
to make sure it
doesn't malfunction?

51
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:55,818
I just did, but MEDUSA seems
to be one step ahead of me.

52
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,619
- Are you reading this?<i>
- Copy Wilson, we read you.</i>

53
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,223
Let's look at the code.

54
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,028
<i>Switching to automatic systems.</i>

55
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,664
I'm losing some
serious control here!

56
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,066
<i>Wilson, are you doing that?</i>

57
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,367
Wait... That's...
That's new code.

58
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,935
I see that.

59
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:16,439
<i>You need to implement
a stop-gap firewall now!</i>

60
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:17,772
Yes! Implementing now!

61
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,408
Well, somebody
hacked our system.

62
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:22,511
No. I checked.
Firewalls are tight.

63
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,645
She's coming up
with her own code.

64
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,582
That's impossible!

65
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:27,850
This looks like a data dump.

66
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:29,317
<i>No, that's not possible either.</i>

67
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:31,887
No, we can't
be reading this correctly.

68
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:33,822
Guys, there are a thousand
ways this could go sideways.

69
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,591
<i>The variables are immense.</i>

70
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:38,859
But when it's too complicated,
the best answer is the simplest.

71
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,996
It's not writing its own code.

72
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:44,500
It can't, at least
not at this level.

73
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,400
The AI doesn't have the...

74
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:49,705
[loud noises]

75
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,873
We need to shut MEDUSA down now.

76
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,876
It's already ahead of me.

77
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:57,313
I've calculated that
it's writing three million lines

78
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,947
of code every eight seconds.

79
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:02,451
That is exponentially increasing
by 42% every five minutes.

80
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:04,452
At that rate...

81
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,254
It's already run
the calculations

82
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,424
you referenced into.

83
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,091
Doctors, I can see it from here.

84
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:11,826
It's counting down
from three hours.

85
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:13,728
It's setting its own
benchmark for firewalls!

86
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:15,865
Those are all
smart-system firewalls.

87
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,235
Now it's working on
the military drone system.

88
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:24,572
Look. Its next
benchmark are the ARES robots

89
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,074
they just launched.

90
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:31,814
ARES robots
were never a good idea.

91
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,483
And all smart missiles,
global military networks!

92
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:37,351
It's outlining a strategy to
take control of them one by one!

93
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:40,421
It's not programmed to take
over the world's military.

94
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:41,656
Now it can!

95
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,358
If MEDUSA updated
its programming

96
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,961
to take over global militaries
without human programming,

97
00:05:46,028 --> 00:05:50,099
without our programming,
that means...

98
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:53,468
It's become sentient, hmm?

99
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,237
That is impossible!

100
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:58,372
If it was, it would
carry out its own directive

101
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,475
to its logical conclusion.

102
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,745
It would use
the military to...

103
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,213
It would wipe out
all life on earth!

104
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,182
Everything goes offline now!

105
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:11,153
Ow! Damn it!

106
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,989
- You okay?
- I'm fine, fine.

107
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:15,790
Guys?

108
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:18,527
Dr. Lopez?

109
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:20,396
Marietta?

110
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,164
Marietta!

111
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,432
It's got the local network!
We don't have much time!

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,235
Look... Look!

113
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,074
MEDUSA has identified
us as a target.

114
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,776
- Why?
- We gotta go.

115
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,343
It's already breached
the military drones!

116
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:38,947
Get outta here! Go!

117
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:41,783
- Guys?
- <i>Update complete.</i>

118
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,286
Guys, go for Wilson!
Guys?

119
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:47,223
<i>Returning to Spaceport
in T-minus five minutes.</i>

120
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:49,625
<i>All personnel must
vacate the premises.</i>

121
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:50,793
<i>Lose all tech!</i>

122
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,494
<i>Anything it can use to ping us!</i>

123
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,430
<i>Phones, tablets, ear pods,
anything with a chip!</i>

124
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:01,903
Dr. Lopez!
Marietta!

125
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:06,373
Okay, I'm abandoning Zone 39.

126
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,442
I'm heading back to camp!

127
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,014
[grunts]

128
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,254
Okay, I'm out.

129
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,857
Doctors, can you hear me?

130
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:23,892
Guys? Damn it!

131
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:29,764
Years ago I created a device
that could override

132
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:31,132
the bunker's mag-locks.

133
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,735
Hopefully, it's still
hidden here.

134
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:35,069
Found it!

135
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:36,805
I just need to enter
the right code.

136
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,508
It's not shutting it down.

137
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:41,242
Let me try.

138
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,978
Once we get inside, we need to
contact NSA, DoD, all of them!

139
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:46,882
Abel, I'm trying to focus!

140
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:49,483
Wait. Let me try this.

141
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,851
All right, listen.

142
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:52,253
Once we get inside,
maybe we can use

143
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,387
the bunker's computers
to hack in...

144
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:54,423
[door opens]

145
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,026
I got it!

146
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:58,894
- <i>Drones are inbound!</i>
- Crap!

147
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,362
I'm on my way.

148
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,996
Wait!

149
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,069
Abel!

150
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:10,506
No!

151
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:41,003
One...

152
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,149
Agh!

153
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:57,785
You okay?
I got the signal.

154
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:00,221
I told you to stay underground.

155
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,856
Let's go.

156
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,360
You're shaking.

157
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:11,332
Did they malfunction

158
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,668
and MEDUSA targeted
Lopez and Marietta?

159
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:16,504
A robot that holds a grudge?

160
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:17,940
What did they do to it?

161
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:23,412
I don't know.
I'm probably a target.

162
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,348
You're not a target

163
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:30,351
unless someone
programmed you as a target.

164
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:33,254
Maybe it thinks I know
how to work the NFX robot.

165
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:35,191
- But you don't know.
- I know I don't know!

166
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:38,293
You know who does?

167
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:45,500
You broke up over a year ago.

168
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,001
She can't still be upset.

169
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,471
Her dad just died...
I...

170
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,076
It's better if it comes
from someone she knows.

171
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:58,514
Yeah.

172
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:01,216
She's a bad-ass.
She can handle this.

173
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:05,086
[banging sound]

174
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,884
Okay, you are in invisible mode

00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:57,505
Three, two, one.
Punch the feed.

182
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:09,918
All yours.

183
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:11,552
Hello, everyone.

184
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:15,157
Free food delivery
courtesy of Silicorp.

185
00:11:15,222 --> 00:11:16,823
Yes, that's right.

186
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,727
<i>We were gonna serve
this high-end surf and turf</i>

187
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:22,096
<i>food truck to our
executive staff today.</i>

188
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,098
But in the spirit of giving,

189
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,267
we thought you
all should enjoy

190
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,737
a wonderful holiday
meal instead.

191
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:31,372
And remember, "At Silicorp,

192
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,677
you're not just a
binary number, you're family."

193
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:38,112
Wow, that was touching,
Gray Scout.

194
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:58,567
<i>Okay, everyone log out of
there, and cover your IP trail</i>

195
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,169
<i>before Silicorp realizes
that it's been hacked.</i>

196
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,246
That must be
a new record, Tara.

197
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:14,949
<i>Whatever.
She had a head start.</i>

198
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:16,317
<i>I got stuff to do.</i>

199
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,520
Wow.

200
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:24,058
Still a sore loser just
like he was in high school.

201
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,193
You want me to send him
some malware?

202
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,663
Malware?
Jorge, no.

203
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,735
Come on, no!

204
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:35,870
Hey, remember what I told you.

205
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:39,073
A good hacker doesn't go after
every dog that barks, okay?

206
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:43,010
As much as I like
to see him squirm,

207
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:44,379
he'll be back again tomorrow.

208
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,382
He can't resist us.

209
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:48,850
You.

210
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:55,357
He can't resist you, you mean.

211
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,326
[beeping]

212
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,129
Couldn't keep off the board,
could you, Cube?

213
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,731
Tara? You there?
Tara?

214
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,134
<i>Is that Wilson?</i>

215
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,501
<i>He knows he should
be calling you by</i>

216
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,302
<i>your hacker name,
Gray Scout.</i>

217
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,971
Do you have a private line
where I could talk to you?

218
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,408
It's about your father.

219
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:16,778
My dad?

220
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,546
<i>Why don't you just call
me on the...</i>

221
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:21,149
We were testing our
NFX rescue robotic unit today

222
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:24,919
and, uh...
there was an accident.

223
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:27,054
<i>He...</i>

224
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:31,492
He... there was a drone.

225
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,460
<i>A drone?</i>

226
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:36,798
<i>It came from nowhere,
a military drone.</i>

227
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:41,903
Dr. Marietta got into
the bunker, but your father...

228
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:43,338
he didn't make it.

229
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:47,775
<i>I don't understand.</i>

230
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,110
<i>Wh... why would a drone...</i>

231
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:51,712
I don't know.

232
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,514
I don't know if
this was sabotage.

233
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,450
I don't know if somebody
hacked into the mainframe,

234
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:58,820
but he was definitely targeted.

235
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:02,323
Probably Marietta as well,
probably me.

236
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,259
<i>Wilson, I...</i>

237
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,895
Tara? Tara!

238
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:10,399
Hey, come in!

239
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:11,533
Tara?

240
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:21,442
Tara?

241
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,421
Tara?

242
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:33,788
Tara, what are you doing?

243
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,191
You can't do that!

244
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:38,460
Don't touch me!

245
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:43,432
What even is this?

246
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,337
I've never seen this before.

247
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:52,038
Is that a CryptoMix?

248
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:53,509
No.

249
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,411
It's a Qbit language
my dad taught me.

250
00:14:56,476 --> 00:14:58,078
He said if anything
suspicious ever happens,

251
00:14:58,145 --> 00:15:01,482
enter that language here on
this computer to protect myself.

252
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:04,584
You think you're in trouble?

253
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:07,322
Not as in trouble as the
assholes who killed my father.

254
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,524
What are you doing?

255
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,494
I just sent a bullet
to take out 3.6%

256
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:14,729
of the nation's drone
coding program.

257
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:15,997
What?

258
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:17,932
At least they can't
keep killing people.

259
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,534
Tara, don't!

260
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,240
You happy now?

261
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:27,875
You think that's gonna
solve everything?

262
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,543
Get out!

263
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,713
You probably just signaled
4,000 NSA mainframe computers

264
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,481
to this location!

265
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:37,384
So maybe you shouldn't be
here when the FBI arrives!

266
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:40,621
My DNA is all over this shit!

267
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,557
This is what they live for!

268
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:46,195
There's probably some jacked up
computer targeting us right now!

269
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:02,778
Oh, no, no, no!
Tara, what did you do?

270
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:06,514
Wilson, she hacked
the Pentagon.

271
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:09,317
She's screwed.

272
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:11,752
I think we're all screwed.

273
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:14,923
What's happening?

274
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,490
Bastards.

275
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:20,561
I used Qbit code and they
echoed it right back at me.

276
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:22,497
Great.
So what do you think?

277
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:23,932
50 years in prison
for shutting down

278
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,933
our nation's
military drone program?

279
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,803
100 years?
200?

280
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:34,342
They just killed
half our system!

281
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:37,679
What is this?

282
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:41,883
Oh, my God,
photos from my smart phones.

283
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,455
Why?

284
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:49,725
I'm gonna try
to reverse the ping.

285
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,259
Get an IP on it!

286
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:54,095
Sending over to you now.

287
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:55,430
Check it out.

288
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,767
Oh, shit.

289
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,900
What?

290
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,101
You're not gonna like it.

291
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:02,403
What?

292
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,940
Spaceport, where your dad
works... worked.

293
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,942
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,578
That's where MEDUSA is?

295
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,445
Damn!

296
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:14,281
What's MEDUSA?

297
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:18,919
Jorge, we have a lot bigger
problems than going to prison.

298
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:20,988
It's the quantum AI
my dad was working on.

299
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:23,625
It can find anyone.

300
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:25,926
We need to hit
the kill switches now!

301
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,561
And grab our go bags!

302
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,132
What?

303
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,834
The drones.

304
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:33,969
- Here?
- No.

305
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:37,838
Gray Scout.

306
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:39,840
Tara!

307
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:41,442
Gray Scout, come in!

308
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,510
<i>We're a little busy right now.</i>

309
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:45,779
There's no time!
You have to get outta there now!

310
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,448
<i>What? Why?</i>

311
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:49,217
We tracked three
tier three military drones

312
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:50,552
- to your location!
- <i>What? How?</i>

313
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:51,885
<i>How, what do we...</i>

314
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:53,254
I don't know!
I don't know!

315
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,722
It senses heat!

316
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:57,224
Are you near a power plant?
Go hide in there!

317
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,925
Destroy everything.

318
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,628
Hibachi style!

319
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,929
Tara, Jorge, can you hear me?
You need to get outta there now!

320
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:04,199
What about us?

321
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,734
Get everything ready.

322
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,536
If we have to leave,
we'll do it quickly.

323
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:10,439
Run!

324
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:15,344
[alarm blaring]

325
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,852
Drones!
Help us!

326
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,986
Robot apocalypse!

327
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:34,756
Active shooter!
Everybody out back!

328
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,891
Jorge!
Listen, it's dangerous!

329
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,360
You don't have to do this!

330
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:40,528
If you want, you can
just go out!

331
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:41,997
Tara, we're in this together.

332
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,535
Fine.

333
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:52,173
We're trapped.

334
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:57,112
I have an idea.

335
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:00,715
- Hibachi.
- Hibachi.

336
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:06,788
Hey!
You gonna pay for all that?

337
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,672
Hurry up, Tara!
Light the fuse!

338
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:35,483
[explosions]

339
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:50,598
Whoa.

340
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:54,535
You ever seen one
of these before?

341
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:56,738
Never been this close
to one before.

342
00:20:56,804 --> 00:21:00,675
It's an entire drone brain.
It's got a whole control panel.

343
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,947
Hey, that thing
just tried to kill us.

344
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:07,781
But I think it's dead.

345
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,985
We should take it.

346
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,755
Come on.

347
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,060
It's okay.

348
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,632
Oh...

349
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:26,967
You know what to do with it?

350
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:33,307
Yeah.

351
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:36,744
Yeah, I do.

352
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:40,615
Let's go.

353
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,851
Hurry!
I can hear more drones!

354
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:51,259
[rapid beeping]

355
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:11,579
Wait.
They turned around?

356
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:21,955
Wilson...

357
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:23,625
<i>We didn't make it to
the power plant.</i>

358
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:25,460
<i>The drones immediately
found us.</i>

359
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,126
Are the drones
still chasing you?

360
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:29,663
<i>No, their targeting systems
must be overwhelmed.</i>

361
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,098
<i>I think we lost them.</i>

362
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:33,166
Good. The grid is freaking
out over here.

363
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,968
<i>Plus, I don't know
if you've seen the news.</i>

364
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:36,670
<i>But there are rolling
blackouts in New York,</i>

365
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:39,541
Chicago, San Francisco
and Alabama.

366
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:42,143
They just had a blackout
in London.

367
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:44,512
<i>Wilson, listen.</i>

368
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:47,080
Just before Jorge and
I escaped from the drones,

369
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:49,416
we received a D.M. from
the NSA server

370
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,284
directed to me by name,

371
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:53,988
putting me at the top
of the terror watch list.

372
00:22:54,055 --> 00:22:56,324
<i>It seized my computer,</i>

373
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,026
then put out a pin for
the entire DoD to track.

374
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:02,129
Yeah. I saw that when I was
controlling the NFX robot.

375
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:03,964
Look, virgin code
was being written

376
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,800
at an astronomical speed.

377
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:07,934
We figured it was MEDUSA.

378
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:09,604
<i>I was afraid of that.</i>

379
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,105
<i>The IP was scattered but
I tracked it back to Spaceport.</i>

380
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:15,309
<i>But how could MEDUSA be
responsible for all of this?</i>

381
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:17,177
What if someone hacked into it?

382
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:18,679
It's gotta be.

383
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,514
No. The coding strings
were unlike anything

384
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,915
that I've ever seen.

385
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:23,783
They were shorthand,
like a stenographer.

386
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:26,488
This...
This coding doesn't exist!

387
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:29,523
But why would it
be targeting us?

388
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:31,291
It's targeting me.

389
00:23:31,358 --> 00:23:35,062
Because it knows you're
Dr. Abel Lopez's daughter!

390
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,830
<i>I think it came
after me</i>

391
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:38,598
<i>because I used the exact
same quantum language</i>

392
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:41,403
<i>as my dad when I hacked
the DoD.</i>

393
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:43,337
<i>Tara sent a bullet
into the heart</i>

394
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:45,506
<i>of the US Military
Cyber system.</i>

395
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:47,108
We saw.

396
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:49,109
<i>But this isn't the military.</i>

397
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:50,844
<i>MEDUSA has gone rogue and it's
not just targeting you.</i>

398
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:52,713
<i>It's targeting everyone.</i>

399
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:08,895
Look, I don't have long.

400
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:10,597
This place is
crawling with drones.

401
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:12,365
<i>I'm the only one now
who's perfectly fluent</i>

402
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:14,268
<i>at coding in my
dad's Qbit language.</i>

403
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:18,271
MEDUSA runs at a quantum system,
so its language is Qbit based.

404
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:21,142
<i>I might be able to hack it,
but I need hands-on access.</i>

405
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,376
But, Tara, that's not an
impossible language to crack.

406
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:25,445
The Pentagon has programmers
who work on those systems.

407
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,280
<i>My dad added variants
to the code,</i>

408
00:24:27,347 --> 00:24:29,316
<i>variants that I know
from him teaching me.</i>

409
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:32,586
<i>Not even Marietta is as good
as I am at this kind of code.</i>

410
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:34,189
<i>It will take other
programmers way too long</i>

411
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,590
<i>to figure it out,
including him.</i>

412
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:39,125
<i>Listen, the AI wants to target
and kill every possible threat.</i>

413
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:40,994
<i>We need to stop it.
Now.</i>

414
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:43,129
So who's gonna stop it?

415
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:44,464
We are.

416
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,299
We gotta work quickly.

417
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,836
<i>Wilson, we used to hang out at
the spaceport in the summer.</i>

418
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:50,605
<i>Remember? We know this place.</i>

419
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:52,140
<i>We used to look up
at the stars there.</i>

420
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,109
I remember!
But there's no way.

421
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:56,309
Listen, I'm not asking you
to go back.

422
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:57,811
I'm going.

423
00:24:57,878 --> 00:24:59,846
No! Gray Scout, you don't know
what you're saying!

424
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,481
Listen, if I don't
stop it before

425
00:25:01,548 --> 00:25:03,017
the upload sequence completes,

426
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,219
<i>the possibility of MEDUSA
overriding all</i>

427
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,654
<i>computers and satellites,
basically everything,</i>

428
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:09,623
<i>in a relatively short time is...</i>

429
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,493
You're not a one-person army!
They have people for this!

430
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:14,894
A system like that has
totally unique hardware, Tara.

431
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,330
Z's right.

432
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:18,732
Its circuitry
and subzero-Kelvin cooling

433
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,300
are one-of-a-kind.

434
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,236
Yes, that's why I have
to go Spaceport directly.

435
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,773
No, Tara, we need
tons of processing

436
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,107
and an open-source platform.

437
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:28,875
No. If I hack it over a network,

438
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:30,144
that would allow it
to track me down

439
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:31,878
as soon as I enter
a single line.

440
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:34,682
<i>Its nationwide networking
defenses are too powerful</i>

441
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:37,315
<i>and too advanced for
me to hack it remotely.</i>

442
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:39,920
I need to be there in person
to patch it in directly

443
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:41,288
and set
a quantum-data bomb.

444
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:42,923
Tara, you're gonna need help!

445
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,192
Any smart weapons
there will kill you

446
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:46,026
as soon as you get close
to the AI!

447
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:47,662
No, no, no.
Don't try to help.

448
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:49,830
Anybody who tries to help
is gonna get us traced,

449
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:51,331
targeted and killed.

450
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:54,534
Tara, I'm not just gonna
let you die out there!

451
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:57,138
You're too important
to all of us!

452
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:59,139
Plus, you're only
a couple hours away.

453
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:00,774
<i>If you need a direct patch,</i>

454
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:02,176
then you'll also need someone
to map out the mainframe

455
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:03,811
to send out the data bomb.

456
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:05,545
If everyone at the Spaceport
gets killed,

457
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:08,816
you'll still need someone
to help you get it.

458
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:11,117
If you're going, I'm going.

459
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:12,619
We're gonna stop it with you.

460
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:15,155
When you reach Huntsville,
we'll be there.

461
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:18,725
You may be a genius hacker,
but you can't do this alone.

462
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,460
<i>You're gonna be outnumbered,</i>

463
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:21,828
<i>so you're gonna need people
that you can trust.</i>

464
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,330
Let us help you.

465
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:25,265
Hey, we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

466
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:28,870
All right.

467
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,737
Meet us at the Spaceport.

468
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:34,208
I'm going to need my Dark Web
contact to make this happen.

469
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:36,276
<i>We're gonna need Red Dragon.</i>

470
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,377
Red Dragon?

471
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:40,013
Really, Gray?
Are you sure about that?

472
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,815
Do we have any other choice?

473
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:43,851
<i>It's at least a six-hour drive
for us to get there</i>

474
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,752
<i>and we'll need every second
to get ahead of the AI</i>

475
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:47,621
<i>as it smashes firewalls.</i>

476
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:50,024
<i>To do that, we'll need gear
to fight against the drones</i>

477
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,558
<i>and anything else MEDUSA
throws at us.</i>

478
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,162
Plus, she owes me a favor.

479
00:26:55,229 --> 00:26:56,730
I don't know, Tara.

480
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:58,766
<i>No one messes with Red Dragon.</i>

481
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,167
Not even the Feds!

482
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:04,804
Her and I have
an understanding, okay?

483
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:08,175
Wilson, meet us,
but be careful. No tech!

484
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,043
Okay, remember
they will find you.

485
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:11,745
There's cameras everywhere.

486
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:14,915
So don't bring any microphones,
internet connections,

487
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,550
anything with digital cameras,

488
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:19,887
anything that
can trace you to me.

489
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:23,756
Tara! Tara!
They found you!

490
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:25,226
You're on my screen!

491
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:30,096
And if you're on my screen...

492
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:31,900
That means they found us.

493
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:37,604
Zee! Zee!

494
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:38,771
Go! Go! Go!

495
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:40,173
I'm on it.

496
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:43,610
Come on, come on, come on!

497
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:53,253
Okay, we gotta go! Come on!
Come on!

498
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,241
Wait.

499
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:16,544
Do you hear that?

500
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:22,350
Drones.

501
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,084
Now what?

502
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:27,054
I can hear them.

503
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:28,889
Come on, come on.

504
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:31,125
It's not pretty, but I have
something that will protect us.

505
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:37,397
What is it?

506
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,967
They're getting closer!

507
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:41,302
Two seconds.

508
00:28:56,817 --> 00:28:58,085
What was that?

509
00:28:58,152 --> 00:29:00,453
Invisibility cloak.
Military grade.

510
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,088
How did you get your
hands on that?

511
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:03,423
They're not available.

512
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,959
I wasn't waiting.
I created my own.

513
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:06,693
Okay.

514
00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:22,442
Red Dragon should be here!

515
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:23,478
This way, hurry.

516
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:36,690
This is gonna take all day.

517
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:43,131
That's it!
The antenna!

518
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:58,646
[Jorge] You're crazy.
No one's here.

519
00:30:02,983 --> 00:30:04,217
There it is.

520
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:16,530
Okay, but how do you know that?

521
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:24,605
GMC Automotive put on an early
camper prototype in the 80s.

522
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:28,209
They called it the Dragon.

523
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:32,413
Really?

524
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:37,817
That... and I can see a
grounded hub of CAT7 wires

525
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:40,153
underneath the chassis.

526
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,089
And about four, five,

527
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,759
six routers attached
to the roof,

528
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,230
not to mention three remotes
in the surrounding trees

529
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:55,068
there, there, and there.

530
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:56,737
You missed 10
satellite transmitters,

531
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:59,439
and about three miles of
cabling and ground wires,

532
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:02,176
and a whole lotta scramblers.

533
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:03,477
Come on in.

534
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:17,390
It's okay.
You're safe here.

535
00:31:17,457 --> 00:31:19,794
Come on, Gray Scout.
Let's go.

536
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:21,395
I've been monitoring
you for a while.

537
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:26,299
You're in an anti-EMP
van, fully-loaded,

538
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,836
lead-lined, off the grid.

539
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:31,305
MEDUSA can't see us,
at least not yet.

540
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:36,677
Off the grid?
With that electronic footprint?

541
00:31:36,743 --> 00:31:38,211
Catch your breath.

542
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:40,448
Thanks.

543
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:41,682
Drink.

544
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:44,684
I saw what happened.

545
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,520
Good job with those drones,
by the way.

546
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,890
I must say, I really am
impressed you made it here.

547
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:52,860
I didn't think
you'd still be here.

548
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:54,261
Well, not after this.

549
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:55,829
You two have more heat
on you than an LHC

550
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:57,563
in a pressure vacuum.

551
00:31:57,631 --> 00:32:00,000
If MEDUSA hasn't
figured out already, she will.

552
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:02,001
She'll be in full control
within the next couple hours,

553
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:03,937
maybe even sooner.

554
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:09,477
I'm sorry about your dad,
but screw him.

555
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,378
Excuse me?

556
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:15,415
Hey, it's his machine that's
going to destroy the world.

557
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:17,017
Look, I'm sure
he's a cool guy and all

558
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:19,019
and took you to Space Camp
when you were younger.

559
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:21,087
But he gets no passes.

560
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:23,757
My dad was creating machines
to help save people.

561
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:26,159
Yeah, it wasn't his fault.
MEDUSA's the one who...

562
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:27,862
Really?

563
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:29,864
Because if he didn't exist,
the MEDUSA wouldn't exist.

564
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,734
But he did and it does,
so here we are.

565
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:37,237
We're trying to stop it.

566
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:38,572
You can't.

567
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:40,674
- We're trying.
- It's self-aware.

568
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,977
It's building an army.
It's...

569
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,744
A machine.

570
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,946
No. Then you go unplug it, but
you know it's not that easy.

571
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:48,414
It's not just a machine.

572
00:32:48,481 --> 00:32:51,684
It's a cancer
that's metastasizing.

573
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,021
We can stop it before the
upload sequence completes.

574
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:58,057
I know what it's capable of.
We've already seen it.

575
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,661
It's gonna seize
the world's military.

576
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:03,997
Of course it is.

577
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,599
Okay.

578
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:07,233
So that means it not only
needs to run a search function

579
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,801
to find weapons.

580
00:33:08,868 --> 00:33:10,803
But it also has to teach
itself to break the firewalls,

581
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,973
then it has to hack
them around the world.

582
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,845
Even on a quantum system, that
buys us, what, 15, 20 minutes?

583
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,779
That gives you nothing.

584
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:21,249
It's something.

585
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:24,584
Even on your best day,

586
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:28,087
it took you 10 minutes
to hack the World Bank.

587
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:30,156
It's gonna take us at
least that amount of time

588
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:31,491
to hack a quantum AI,

589
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:34,862
so we don't have
10 minutes to waste.

590
00:33:34,928 --> 00:33:36,864
We're gonna need
analog transportation

591
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,900
and as much analog tech
and weapons as we can carry.

592
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:43,803
You can't hide
from surveillance.

593
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:46,472
You've been telling me you
liked my Qbit-level coding

594
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:48,442
and reference-free algorithms.

595
00:33:48,508 --> 00:33:50,277
Oh, come on.
That's not fair.

596
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:52,446
I gave you every
closed-source Q codes

597
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:55,749
to get you an
unbreakable ghost IP.

598
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:57,683
I knew this day would come.
It always does.

599
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,488
Desperate and
morally compromised.

600
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:05,424
You still owe me.

601
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:07,360
That IP got my place swatted!

602
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:12,565
I hope the heist was worth it.

603
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:16,903
Hey, I ran a trace
of MEDUSA's first few lines

604
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,672
of code under your IP.

605
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,673
It crashed my burner system.

606
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,409
I need to be there in person,
no networks!

607
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:25,077
It's the only way.

608
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:28,148
It'll have to be a Sysconfig
databomb sliding-base

609
00:34:28,215 --> 00:34:29,682
so I can mess
with its power.

610
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,052
Only then can it be
destroyed, physically.

611
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,687
Okay, but you'll need
someone to map the interface

612
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:35,456
to make that bomb
deliverable, though,

613
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:37,490
assuming the AI
doesn't kill them first.

614
00:34:37,557 --> 00:34:40,594
I'm not willing to
fall on that sword.

615
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,996
We're not asking.

616
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:47,134
I assume you destroyed all your
traceable software and info?

617
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:48,735
Hibachi style.

618
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:50,403
Yeah, it's all fried.

619
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:52,139
What we didn't burn,
the drones did.

620
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:53,673
Good, yeah.

621
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:56,109
Well, if anything happens
to me, I have Black Fire.

622
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,678
It's my kill-all virus.

623
00:34:57,744 --> 00:35:00,947
I have one,
my cousin Derek has the other.

624
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:02,782
He's my fail-safe.

625
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:05,050
Hey, here.
We got one of the drones.

626
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:07,020
It was pretty banged up
from the fireworks.

627
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:10,457
But Jorge managed
to rip out the brains.

628
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:13,760
I figured it's configured for
military networking commands,

629
00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:16,963
so I can probably use it to hack
the system over at Spaceport.

630
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,998
Let me see that.

631
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:27,708
Yeah, this is nothing like what
we've seen on the black market.

632
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:30,844
Besides having an obscene
amount of memory,

633
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:35,215
it's got an unusual
audio receiver right here.

634
00:35:35,282 --> 00:35:39,820
Its sensitivity is measured
in 10,000ths of a hertz.

635
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,222
I can't really figure out why.

636
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,824
And a weird looking solenoid.

637
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:46,827
Yeah. That hooks up
to a capacitor

638
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:48,628
that takes
its electrical load way up,

639
00:35:48,695 --> 00:35:50,797
but I'm still not sure why.

640
00:35:50,864 --> 00:35:52,465
Almost like defibrillator.

641
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:53,934
It closes in on a person,

642
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,870
then electrocutes them
in the chest or the head.

643
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:59,639
Quite an efficient killing
instead of blowing someone up.

644
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:02,643
Here, look.

645
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,153
It didn't shoot 'em.

646
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:14,253
Right, but the targeting
system of the drones

647
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,588
show a huge electrical spike.

648
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:18,257
Heart attack maybe?

649
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:19,859
Maybe.

650
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:21,929
I've never seen that
on a military drone before,

651
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:24,431
but it could be.

652
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:29,869
Tara, this AI is
nothing to play with.

653
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:32,206
Yeah, it's probably
how it killed my dad.

654
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:35,909
I'm sorry I showed you that,

655
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,679
but if it helps,
I don't think he suffered.

656
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:40,180
It's like he shut down

657
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,882
and you were right to
keep the drone brain.

658
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:43,951
If you hard patch this to
a security network

659
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:45,818
you can gain access
to a restricted area

660
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:47,153
if it thinks you're a drone.

661
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:50,757
So although the AI
has insane ability

662
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:53,760
to make very accurate
probabilistic choices

663
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:56,664
and track everything you do,

664
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,300
it still sees people as
people and tech as tech.

665
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:03,003
And don't forget, it can track
you almost everywhere you go.

666
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:06,873
You mean, like
via orbital satellites?

667
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,108
No, no.

668
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:10,943
It's working its way
to that, but no.

669
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,215
Tara, it knows
everything about you.

670
00:37:15,282 --> 00:37:17,784
It knows everyone
you've ever known.

671
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,720
It knows our history online.

672
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:25,425
So that it probably knows
that I'm here.

673
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:27,259
Yes, and when it's
looking for you,

674
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:28,762
it uses things like that drone

675
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,364
that can hear a fly
in a beehive.

676
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:33,199
It's not gonna let
some hacker stand in the way

677
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:34,533
of it destroying the world.

678
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,537
Do you get it?

679
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:43,009
This is an EMP pulse grenade.

680
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:45,545
Once activated, you have
five seconds to hit your target

681
00:37:45,612 --> 00:37:47,113
before an EMP blast,

682
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:50,115
canceling out all electronics
within a 50-yard radius.

683
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:52,052
So, you wanna stay way
clear of it.

684
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:57,924
Do you have your
quantum tablet on you?

685
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,960
This is your
father's technology.

686
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,963
I'm gonna download a Nano cloak
shield to your quantum tablet.

687
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,899
Also, this not only
refracts light

688
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:07,833
to make you invisible
to cameras,

689
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,134
but is also a Penrose polymer

690
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:11,472
which cancels out
all heat signatures

691
00:38:11,538 --> 00:38:13,173
and that includes
radar or sonar.

692
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,241
- You got all that?
- Invisibility. Copy.

693
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:17,077
We need firepower.

694
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:19,778
It thinks we're terrorists, it
keep on firing missiles at us.

695
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,847
You have to stop
taking this personal.

696
00:38:21,914 --> 00:38:25,351
To MEDUSA, you are only an
answer to a binary question.

697
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:27,621
And what's the question?

698
00:38:27,686 --> 00:38:30,790
How do I stop
her from deprogramming me?

699
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:33,993
Either way, you'll need this.

700
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:37,597
This is an AK-47,
fully automatic.

701
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:39,800
Safety's here, trigger's here.

702
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,735
They're hard to come by,
so you're gonna need it.

703
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:44,872
You know how to shoot?

704
00:38:44,938 --> 00:38:48,976
My dad was a gun guy, took me
to the range a few times.

705
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:52,913
Good.

706
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:55,848
Here, look at this.

707
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,120
This is happening now,
all over the world?

708
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:10,963
Damn, that's MEDUSA?

709
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,532
Yes, and this is just a start.

710
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,501
MEDUSA is throwing
Moore's Law out the window.

711
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,905
Once it seizes access to it,
it's gonna take advantage of it.

712
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:21,041
This is nuts.

713
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,544
MEDUSA was created to help
my dad's NFX rescue robot.

714
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,277
It was designed
to help save people.

715
00:39:25,344 --> 00:39:26,746
Maybe it is.

716
00:39:26,813 --> 00:39:28,114
Maybe it's saving us
from ourselves.

717
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:31,652
No one deserves this.

718
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:34,020
Maybe not.

719
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:36,989
<i>Red Dragon!
Come in, Red Dragon!</i>

720
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:37,823
Come in.

721
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:39,226
This is Red Dragon.

722
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:41,893
<i>It's me, Derek!
Can you hear me?</i>

723
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,029
It's my cousin Derek.

724
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:44,398
<i>You were right, Red Dragon.</i>

725
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:46,900
<i>Medusa isn't just using drones.</i>

726
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:48,568
<i>I'm headed back
to the compound.</i>

727
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:50,004
<i>I'll call you when I get there.</i>

728
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:53,706
<i>Look alive, boys!</i>

729
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:55,208
<i>We're getting hit
from all sides!</i>

730
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:56,910
<i>We're dealing with
cyborgs here.</i>

731
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:59,313
<i>I can hold them off for now,
but hurry!</i>

732
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,747
Derek!

733
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,615
What is he talking about?

734
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,350
What cyborg machines?

735
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:06,854
It's the ARES project.
I don't know much about it.

736
00:40:08,855 --> 00:40:10,088
It's Black Ops.

737
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:12,157
Used for military
high target asserts.

738
00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:14,893
I was afraid that if MEDUSA
was able to control the system,

739
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,296
this would be the first thing
it would control.

740
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:19,632
- What?
- Jorge, come on.

741
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:23,069
What makes these ultra scary
is that they shoot microchips.

742
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:24,471
What?

743
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:27,306
Microchips that take over
your body and control you.

744
00:40:27,373 --> 00:40:29,108
Wait.
Control you how?

745
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:31,412
They're designed to attach
to the central nervous system

746
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:33,746
of humans, controlling
and subduing them.

747
00:40:33,813 --> 00:40:36,949
If MEDUSA is able to hack
into those chips,

748
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:39,518
they can directly
control human behavior.

749
00:40:39,585 --> 00:40:43,056
Kill yourself,
your fellow soldier, anything.

750
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:48,061
It just gets worse and worse.

751
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:51,130
All right, so if MEDUSA
has control of the ARES project,

752
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:54,067
then that means she's gaining
control faster than we know it?

753
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:58,137
MEDUSA is seizing
networks across

754
00:40:58,204 --> 00:41:00,239
the entire globe right now.

755
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,282
Damn it!

756
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:11,617
The drones have entered
my five-mile perimeter.

757
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:13,719
Medusa found us.

758
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:15,688
Jorge, drive the van!

759
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:17,191
Go!

760
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:09,041
Hey!

761
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:11,144
Take this, take this.

762
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,080
Everything is fully supplied,
all right?

763
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:21,121
Listen, this is a map to my
cousin Derek's compound.

764
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:22,523
Wave this out of the window

765
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:24,557
as you approach so
they know I sent you.

766
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,460
Hey, thanks, Brenda.

767
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:29,061
It's Red Dragon.

768
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:31,564
But you can call me Brenda
if you make it back alive.

769
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,232
Come on.

770
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:40,374
Keys are in the wheel well.

771
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,575
It's old school.
No electronics.

772
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:45,377
No power steering, no power
brakes, no satellite radio?

773
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:46,646
Thanks, Red Dragon.

774
00:42:46,713 --> 00:42:49,316
Don't thank me.
Just go save the world.

775
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:53,853
Shit, I think I hear the drones.

776
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,188
- Go!
- What about you?

777
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:56,590
Just go!

778
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,244
Tara!
They're going to lock onto us!

779
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:19,746
- Hold the wheel!
- What?

780
00:43:19,811 --> 00:43:21,315
Hold the wheel!

781
00:43:27,753 --> 00:43:28,989
Woo!

782
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:32,291
Let's go!
Woo!

783
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:35,161
What was that thing?

784
00:43:35,228 --> 00:43:37,463
Just another pause
in the time clock.

785
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:40,534
Woo!

786
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:50,244
Oh, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

787
00:44:00,286 --> 00:44:01,655
No!

788
00:44:03,356 --> 00:44:06,159
This is gonna feel so good.

789
00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:10,530
[screams]

790
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:16,003
[gasps]

791
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:23,277
Hey...

792
00:44:27,746 --> 00:44:29,248
We got a job to do.

793
00:44:54,273 --> 00:44:55,740
It's only a matter of time.

794
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:57,210
Shh!

795
00:45:01,813 --> 00:45:03,951
There are phone lines
going into that tunnel.

796
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:08,054
We hack them and lure
as many of those things

797
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:09,888
down there as we can.

798
00:45:09,956 --> 00:45:11,557
Then we blow up the tunnel.

799
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,559
You like to blow
things up, right?

800
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:16,362
You know I do.

801
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:17,597
Come on.

802
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:35,148
Hey, a couple more exits.
I gotta pee.

803
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:40,320
Tara?

804
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:43,923
Hey, you good?

805
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:45,125
Huh?

806
00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:48,027
You want a drink?

807
00:45:48,094 --> 00:45:49,596
No, I'm good.

808
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:11,784
Was that a camera flash?

809
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:13,353
Huh?

810
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:28,434
Jesus!

811
00:46:31,003 --> 00:46:32,606
Tara, we got company!

812
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:43,550
MEDUSA...

813
00:46:43,617 --> 00:46:46,486
Ah, this is not good!
This is not good!

814
00:46:48,688 --> 00:46:50,289
Jorge, listen to me.

815
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:52,125
I need you to grab the AK-47
and use it.

816
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:54,860
Yeah.
I got it. I got it.

817
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:56,528
You ever use an AK-47 before?

818
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:58,130
What? No!

819
00:46:58,197 --> 00:47:01,366
Today's your lucky day.
Take it!

820
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:04,704
But I don't know...
I don't know how to use it!

821
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,273
Jorge, take the wheel
or use the gun!

822
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,076
We have very limited
options here!

823
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:37,204
I'm running out of bullets!

824
00:47:38,505 --> 00:47:40,239
Shit!

825
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:41,775
Next exit's ours!

826
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:52,717
[laughing]

827
00:47:52,784 --> 00:47:54,221
Woo!

828
00:47:55,922 --> 00:47:57,289
Shit.

829
00:48:03,862 --> 00:48:06,298
[Wilson] I can hear them,
they're almost here!

830
00:48:06,364 --> 00:48:08,633
[Zee] Done.
The bomb is armed.

831
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:10,836
There's an exit above us.
Hurry!

832
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:17,711
[screams]

833
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:21,280
Nice moves.

834
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:24,183
Whoa, yeah.

835
00:48:25,585 --> 00:48:26,952
We did it.

836
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:28,721
How many do you think we got?

837
00:48:28,788 --> 00:48:30,222
Dozens.

838
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,259
Come on.

839
00:48:33,326 --> 00:48:34,860
- Let's go to the Spaceport.
- Okay.

840
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:39,798
Whoa.

841
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:48,540
Get the map from my bag.

842
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:51,178
Red Dragon's cousin
is here somewhere.

843
00:48:53,913 --> 00:48:55,248
Take a right here!

844
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:05,291
You think we outran 'em?

845
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:08,428
In this truck? No.

846
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:11,564
Look out!

847
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:12,932
Ares!

848
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,689
Take a right here.

849
00:49:52,505 --> 00:49:53,740
Welcome, Gray Scout.

850
00:50:11,657 --> 00:50:13,293
Here's some coffee.

851
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:14,827
Cici makes it strong.

852
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:16,895
Thank you.

853
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:19,264
You guys got an update
on the drone situation?

854
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:22,034
Yeah. They came in about
half an hour ago.

855
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:24,569
My sources are saying that the
drones, they're not listening

856
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:26,539
to any commands from the DoD

857
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,242
and they're starting to patrol
in all cities.

858
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:30,744
Large and small.

859
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:34,947
Pretty messed up, right?

860
00:50:43,655 --> 00:50:46,192
We got a distress call
coming from the east coast.

861
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:48,760
They're all over Europe, going
from building to building,

862
00:50:48,827 --> 00:50:52,597
street to street,
wiping 'em all out.

863
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:53,998
Wait, are these
the ARES sentinels

864
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:55,000
that Red Dragon mentioned?

865
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:56,635
Yep.

866
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:58,038
We just can't stand down,

867
00:50:58,103 --> 00:51:01,373
not without armor-piercing
ammo at least.

868
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,141
Just to know what you guys
are up against,

869
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:06,611
they're taking out
oil refineries, gas stations,

870
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:08,180
just blowing 'em up.

871
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:12,150
Uh, listen...

872
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:13,353
We know.

873
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:17,057
We knew about Red Dragon
the second it happened.

874
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:20,894
Years back, she sent me this.

875
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:23,596
What is it?

876
00:51:25,465 --> 00:51:27,066
It's a fail-safe.

877
00:51:27,132 --> 00:51:28,766
One lights up blue to check in.

878
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,636
Red for help,
green means she uploaded

879
00:51:31,704 --> 00:51:34,373
some kind of info into
our private server.

880
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,208
If both are black...

881
00:51:36,275 --> 00:51:37,610
Means her heart stopped.

882
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,715
She talked a lot about you.

883
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:44,483
She told me to give this to you.

884
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:51,758
Thank you.

885
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,262
There's an RIFD chip
on the back.

886
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:57,964
I know.

887
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,698
Do you know what for?

888
00:51:59,764 --> 00:52:00,665
No.

889
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:02,168
You're safe here for a minute.

890
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:04,703
Relax for a second and
take anything you need.

891
00:52:04,771 --> 00:52:06,506
These walls are lead-lined.

892
00:52:06,572 --> 00:52:09,175
And there's cameras up
all over the place.

893
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:11,010
It used to be a mechanic's shop.

894
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:15,882
We can put your truck on stilts,
check it out if you like.

895
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:16,916
Shit!

896
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:22,253
Yeah.

897
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,557
Yeah, all right, as long as
there's no oil or gas leaks.

898
00:52:25,623 --> 00:52:27,725
We don't wanna
waste too much time.

899
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:30,128
Maybe we could check if
there's a tracker on it?

900
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:33,132
Hopefully, this is enough
to get us to the Spaceport.

901
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:34,567
Let's hope so.

902
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:36,101
Especially with what
you're up against.

903
00:52:36,168 --> 00:52:37,869
And we'll stock the truck
with gas, food and water.

904
00:52:37,936 --> 00:52:40,271
Yo, look at this!

905
00:52:40,338 --> 00:52:41,974
Hey, hey, hey!

906
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:43,443
It's loaded, man.

907
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:52,851
Is that a good luck charm?

908
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,922
Sort of, yeah.

909
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:58,424
It's kind of helps center me.

910
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:02,762
It was my dad's.

911
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:04,397
He was spinning it
the first time

912
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:06,431
he taught me quantum computing.

913
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:10,669
I thought I knew so much about
hacking and coding as a kid.

914
00:53:10,737 --> 00:53:12,405
Like I had all the
secrets to the universe

915
00:53:12,472 --> 00:53:14,674
figured out in zeroes and ones.

916
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:21,114
- Then he showed me.
- Showed you what?

917
00:53:23,114 --> 00:53:26,985
If I asked you to call it
on a flip, heads or tails,

918
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:28,221
could you do it?

919
00:53:30,255 --> 00:53:31,990
Sure.
Heads.

920
00:53:33,092 --> 00:53:34,527
Tails?

921
00:53:37,262 --> 00:53:39,297
Derek's right.
Heads.

922
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:41,666
And that's basic code.

923
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:43,569
Its either a one or a zero

924
00:53:43,635 --> 00:53:47,039
and it's a 50-50 shot that
either you or I get it right.

925
00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:53,278
But what if it was spinning?

926
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:55,481
Could you call it?

927
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:56,781
I don't know.

928
00:53:56,849 --> 00:53:59,184
- Heads?
- Tails.

929
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:02,187
You're both right.

930
00:54:02,253 --> 00:54:05,924
See, when it's spinning,

931
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,861
it's in a state
of super position,

932
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:10,530
which means that it's both.

933
00:54:11,697 --> 00:54:13,666
See? Tails. I called it.

934
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:16,402
In the quantum world,
Qbits become entangled,

935
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:18,070
so no matter how they land,

936
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:20,606
they always influence and
affect each other.

937
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:24,876
It's kind of like us.

938
00:54:24,943 --> 00:54:26,646
Whoever we become
entangled with

939
00:54:26,713 --> 00:54:29,716
eventually becomes part
of our solution.

940
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:33,552
I'm more of a heads
or tails guy.

941
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,521
I like to know my odds.

942
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:37,190
Quiet!

943
00:54:43,228 --> 00:54:44,630
I don't hear it anymore.

944
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:47,267
Maybe it's gone.

945
00:54:50,402 --> 00:54:53,438
[steady beeping]

946
00:54:53,505 --> 00:54:57,542
I think that's Dr. Marietta
trying to give us a signal.

947
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,246
Tara? You there?
Tara?

948
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:02,280
<i>Wilson, get off the line.</i>

949
00:55:02,347 --> 00:55:03,916
We have a few minutes.

950
00:55:03,983 --> 00:55:07,119
I'm doing some IR bouncing,
back to my ghosting days.

951
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:08,253
<i>Where are you?</i>

952
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,722
Right outside Spaceport.

953
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:11,256
Zee's been working out
the Qbit functions

954
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:14,225
to determine MEDUSA's
rate of expansion.

955
00:55:14,293 --> 00:55:17,697
We got a little less than
85 minutes before it's too late.

956
00:55:17,764 --> 00:55:19,097
Can you do that?

957
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:20,566
I don't think I can do
much without you.

958
00:55:20,632 --> 00:55:22,366
<i>Yeah, I can do that.</i>

959
00:55:22,434 --> 00:55:26,506
Tara, you're the only one
truly fluent in its language,

960
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:30,610
but you will need me to map
that interface for you.

961
00:55:30,675 --> 00:55:32,545
You might need
Dr. Marietta's help.

962
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,446
So he is alive?

963
00:55:34,512 --> 00:55:36,114
Last I saw him.

964
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:37,817
He was heading in the bunker
with your father.

965
00:55:39,184 --> 00:55:41,320
The bunker looks
like an ancient doorway.

966
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:42,822
I don't know why.

967
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:45,123
It has a smart lock system
that I powered down.

968
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,458
But it can't be opened
unless he powers it up,

969
00:55:47,525 --> 00:55:48,893
drawing the drones.

970
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,361
<i>We'll get there ASAP.</i>

971
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:52,164
<i>We're armed with
mechanical weapons</i>

972
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:54,200
<i>and an old school car
they can't trace.</i>

973
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:57,469
<i>As for Dr. Marietta, we'll
bring tools and manpower</i>

974
00:55:57,536 --> 00:55:58,936
<i>to pry open the lock manually.</i>

975
00:55:59,003 --> 00:56:02,607
No, no! He's sealed
until it powers up.

976
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:04,010
If I engage the locks
and try to leave,

977
00:56:04,076 --> 00:56:06,378
it'll instantly attract
their attention.

978
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:08,080
<i>We got inbound hostiles!</i>

979
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:10,148
<i>We need to get you packed
and out of here now!</i>

980
00:56:10,215 --> 00:56:11,149
<i>Wilson, I...</i>

981
00:56:11,215 --> 00:56:12,484
[static]

982
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:13,684
What's happening?

983
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:15,353
You lose connection?

984
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,722
No, this is on her end.

985
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:27,798
And, remember,
they can't get in.

986
00:56:27,865 --> 00:56:29,302
Are you sure about that?

987
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:33,005
Holy shit!

988
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:37,876
I'm gonna activate the shield.

989
00:56:37,943 --> 00:56:39,311
It's go time!

990
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:42,681
Guys, we gotta get out of here.

991
00:56:42,748 --> 00:56:43,950
Shh!

992
00:56:45,784 --> 00:56:47,953
They know we're here!
We gotta go now!

993
00:57:02,701 --> 00:57:03,969
[shouting]

994
00:57:08,373 --> 00:57:09,741
Move!

995
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,715
Ah!

996
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:19,384
Cici!
What are you doing?

997
00:57:19,452 --> 00:57:22,188
[screams]

998
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:24,891
No!

999
00:57:32,998 --> 00:57:34,700
I seen the specs on ARES.

1000
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:36,534
We can't outrun 'em,
we can't outfight 'em.

1001
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:37,568
The Red Dragon software!

1002
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:38,936
Did you download it?

1003
00:57:39,003 --> 00:57:40,139
The invisibility cloak?
Doing it now.

1004
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:42,406
What are you doing?

1005
00:57:42,474 --> 00:57:43,709
This shield refracts
light and absorbs heat,

1006
00:57:43,775 --> 00:57:44,710
making us invisible to them.

1007
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:46,913
I hope this works!

1008
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:22,981
Red Dragon gave us this
old school car

1009
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:24,382
so we wouldn't be detected.

1010
00:58:24,449 --> 00:58:25,916
That's why I drive
these type of cars.

1011
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:28,152
You guys have
everything you... ah!

1012
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:30,522
- Oh! Derek!
- Shit!

1013
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,789
- I got it, go!
- Damn it!

1014
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:33,092
Go!

1015
00:58:34,626 --> 00:58:37,196
[grunting]

1016
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:57,349
Ah!

1017
00:59:20,606 --> 00:59:21,908
How are you doing?

1018
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:25,110
What the hell is that?

1019
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:33,951
You gotta be shitting me.

1020
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:35,387
What do we do?

1021
00:59:37,889 --> 00:59:39,291
Let's see what Derek gave us.

1022
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:53,504
RPG Grenade Launcher!

1023
00:59:53,572 --> 00:59:55,173
You ready for this?

1024
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:06,318
Keep it steady!

1025
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:09,288
I'm trying!

1026
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,424
Get closer!

1027
01:00:16,027 --> 01:00:19,097
- Closer!
- I'm driving!

1028
01:00:20,865 --> 01:00:22,068
Jorge!

1029
01:00:22,134 --> 01:00:23,969
I'm trying!

1030
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,105
Ah!

1031
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,409
Yah!

1032
01:00:40,753 --> 01:00:42,487
This is bad, Zee.

1033
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:45,257
There's ARES and drones
patrolling this whole area.

1034
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:47,159
I hope Tara has
more firepower than this.

1035
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,461
Hey, my IEDs got us
this far, didn't they?

1036
01:00:52,764 --> 01:00:55,468
She's tough, okay?

1037
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:58,470
She kicked our butts in
the hacking competition.

1038
01:00:58,536 --> 01:00:59,672
She'll be here.

1039
01:01:04,409 --> 01:01:06,177
You know you can't use that,

1040
01:01:06,244 --> 01:01:08,079
not now,
not when we're so close.

1041
01:01:08,146 --> 01:01:09,248
I know. I...

1042
01:01:09,315 --> 01:01:11,150
I just wanna know if she's okay.

1043
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:12,918
She's fine.

1044
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:16,954
- Oh! Damn it!
- Whoa!

1045
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:18,690
- Jorge!
- Jorge!

1046
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:20,224
Jorge!

1047
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,494
Oh, my God, you scared me, man.

1048
01:01:23,661 --> 01:01:24,864
Where's Tara?

1049
01:01:24,929 --> 01:01:26,764
She still at
the bunker or...

1050
01:01:26,831 --> 01:01:28,166
No.

1051
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:30,669
What?

1052
01:01:30,735 --> 01:01:32,438
She... she...

1053
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:34,972
The ARES, they're
getting massive updates

1054
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,675
every nanosecond.

1055
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,876
They came out of nowhere.

1056
01:01:37,943 --> 01:01:39,345
I'm so sorry.

1057
01:01:41,246 --> 01:01:42,581
We need to find Marietta.

1058
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:44,615
He can put a stop to this.

1059
01:01:44,682 --> 01:01:46,284
Just grab what you need.

1060
01:01:46,351 --> 01:01:47,786
I don't know what I need.

1061
01:01:47,853 --> 01:01:49,253
Then don't grab anything, right?

1062
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,222
Come on!
Let's go!

1063
01:01:53,893 --> 01:01:56,262
Okay?

1064
01:01:58,664 --> 01:02:00,098
[Jorge] Are you sure that
using the drone brain

1065
01:02:00,164 --> 01:02:01,733
to trigger the lock
is going to work?

1066
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,669
I mean, it still shares
the same formatting protocols

1067
01:02:03,735 --> 01:02:05,570
as the AI.

1068
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:07,538
[Wilson] That's exactly why
it won't get the AI's attention.

1069
01:02:07,606 --> 01:02:10,342
The AI will read it
as a drone trigger

1070
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:12,144
in the lock instead
of a person

1071
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,679
as part of its
safety protocol, right?

1072
01:02:14,746 --> 01:02:20,085
So if we do want to destroy
the ARES and the drones,

1073
01:02:20,152 --> 01:02:23,856
then Jorge and I already
worked it out. All right?

1074
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:28,126
Even the smartest AI
doesn't think like us.

1075
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:30,328
It does everything

1076
01:02:30,394 --> 01:02:34,365
in the most perfect
way possible.

1077
01:02:34,432 --> 01:02:37,668
It doesn't take into account
the quantity of people

1078
01:02:37,735 --> 01:02:41,005
or the amount of those
who are heavily armed.

1079
01:02:41,072 --> 01:02:46,411
So once we destroy that ARES
and we get the doctor out,

1080
01:02:48,246 --> 01:02:51,216
we send Jorge with the
majority of our weapons.

1081
01:02:51,282 --> 01:02:55,186
And then Zee, you and I,
we go to the Spaceport.

1082
01:02:55,253 --> 01:02:57,155
What do you mean,
the majority of our weapons?

1083
01:02:57,222 --> 01:02:59,291
Whoever has the most weapons
and is using them

1084
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,427
on the robots will be perceived
as the bigger threat.

1085
01:03:02,661 --> 01:03:04,596
Yeah.

1086
01:03:04,663 --> 01:03:08,367
MEDUSA is constantly calibrating
its responses to our decisions.

1087
01:03:08,432 --> 01:03:11,170
It knows we're headed here.

1088
01:03:11,235 --> 01:03:12,871
It knows that
we can't hack into it

1089
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:14,806
from the outside and
it knows that we're armed.

1090
01:03:14,873 --> 01:03:16,742
So it's going to assume
that we'll shoot our way in.

1091
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:18,410
It'll break ranks.

1092
01:03:18,476 --> 01:03:20,445
And when it does that,
it'll send the most robots

1093
01:03:20,512 --> 01:03:22,313
after whoever
has the most weapons.

1094
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,082
Can't go after
every dog that barks.

1095
01:03:24,148 --> 01:03:26,484
But once it runs
facial recognition on you,

1096
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,387
MEDUSA's gonna ignore
every distraction

1097
01:03:29,454 --> 01:03:31,756
and just send all the drones
straight to you.

1098
01:03:31,822 --> 01:03:33,391
Doesn't matter.

1099
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:35,260
It'll buy us some time.

1100
01:03:35,327 --> 01:03:37,029
I'll do it.

1101
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:39,230
I'll be the bait, not Jorge.

1102
01:03:39,297 --> 01:03:40,765
No, no!
It should be me!

1103
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,501
The two of you need to get
to Dr. Marietta.

1104
01:03:43,568 --> 01:03:47,072
I got the weapons
to distract it.

1105
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:48,407
Wow, I...

1106
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:50,576
Thank me by destroying
these things.

1107
01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:53,878
Okay, we crossed
a bridge back there.

1108
01:03:53,945 --> 01:03:57,549
I'm gonna draw them to it
and use it as a trap.

1109
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,623
See you guys soon, right?

1110
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:06,291
Yeah.

1111
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:08,527
Come on.

1112
01:04:08,592 --> 01:04:10,627
Dr. Marietta is
in a bunker over there.

1113
01:04:10,695 --> 01:04:11,764
Come on.

1114
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:20,071
Kind of conspicuous for
a hidden underground bunker,

1115
01:04:20,137 --> 01:04:21,574
don't you think?

1116
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:24,342
That's the logic.
Hide things in plain sight.

1117
01:04:24,409 --> 01:04:26,110
Plus, if people do
go up to it...

1118
01:04:26,177 --> 01:04:27,612
They get in trouble.

1119
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:30,416
No.
It triggers MEDUSA.

1120
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:58,676
That's Zee.
She's still shooting.

1121
01:04:58,744 --> 01:05:00,245
Just focus.

1122
01:05:00,311 --> 01:05:02,313
Wilson!

1123
01:05:03,282 --> 01:05:05,117
Wilson?

1124
01:05:05,182 --> 01:05:07,585
I can't believe it, Wilson.

1125
01:05:07,652 --> 01:05:09,587
And I don't know who you are,

1126
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:12,157
but you're my favorite
person in the whole world.

1127
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:15,360
I'm Jorge.

1128
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:18,230
I used to work with...

1129
01:05:18,297 --> 01:05:20,965
Tara's dead.

1130
01:05:21,032 --> 01:05:22,168
One of the ARES got her.

1131
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:25,436
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

1132
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,472
Doctor, what do we need to do?

1133
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:30,275
- [banging sound]
- What's that?

1134
01:05:30,342 --> 01:05:32,277
I think they're trying
to get in!

1135
01:05:32,344 --> 01:05:34,045
They're getting smarter.

1136
01:05:34,112 --> 01:05:35,814
Look, when I locked myself in,

1137
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,982
I figured I could take
the communications tunnel

1138
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,418
directly to base.

1139
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:41,019
But there are probably
robots already

1140
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:42,653
approaching through there,
We'd all be trapped.

1141
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:44,822
What if we trigger
the EMP grenade in here?

1142
01:05:44,889 --> 01:05:46,290
No, no, no.

1143
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:47,459
The bunker is steel
reinforced, lead-lined.

1144
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:49,027
It's three feet thick.

1145
01:05:49,094 --> 01:05:50,829
The pulse wouldn't even
kill a phone on the roof.

1146
01:05:50,896 --> 01:05:53,932
But it would surge
through the computer console,

1147
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:56,467
blow up and likely kill us all.

1148
01:05:56,534 --> 01:05:57,769
Ah!

1149
01:05:59,804 --> 01:06:01,507
But you can
communicate wirelessly?

1150
01:06:01,574 --> 01:06:02,740
Yes, yes.

1151
01:06:02,807 --> 01:06:04,976
There's a central antenna
that runs

1152
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:06,445
from the console
to a patch.

1153
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:08,580
- And it carries a current?
- Exactly.

1154
01:06:08,646 --> 01:06:10,282
Okay, well, if the pulse
is electromagnetic

1155
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:13,218
then we get a couple of copper
wires and create a solenoid.

1156
01:06:13,284 --> 01:06:14,353
Yes!

1157
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:16,054
So the pulse we
transferred from

1158
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:18,023
electromagnetic into electric.

1159
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,257
We fry them with electricity.

1160
01:06:19,324 --> 01:06:20,825
It's a Tesla coil!

1161
01:06:20,891 --> 01:06:24,261
But those grenades, they go
off in only a few seconds!

1162
01:06:24,329 --> 01:06:26,198
Not this time.

1163
01:06:26,264 --> 01:06:28,300
I've got a bomb
and I'm gonna recalibrate it

1164
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:30,536
to its original base function,

1165
01:06:30,601 --> 01:06:32,237
give us enough time
to reach the tunnel.

1166
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:35,807
But if you turn it on,
won't it trigger more robots?

1167
01:06:37,275 --> 01:06:38,644
The pulse will take them out.

1168
01:06:40,445 --> 01:06:41,913
Jorge, I'm going to need
you to go over there

1169
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:42,914
and grab the antenna wire.

1170
01:06:42,981 --> 01:06:44,416
Marietta?

1171
01:06:44,481 --> 01:06:45,384
Grab the cable and plug
it up to the computer.

1172
01:06:45,451 --> 01:06:47,184
Go, go, go!

1173
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:48,487
Move quickly, gentleman.

1174
01:06:48,554 --> 01:06:50,856
Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

1175
01:06:50,922 --> 01:06:53,157
Right, uh... How much longer
'til MEDUSA fully takes over?

1176
01:06:53,224 --> 01:06:54,559
20 minutes, maybe less.

1177
01:06:54,626 --> 01:06:56,227
There's like a
thousand wires over here!

1178
01:06:56,293 --> 01:06:57,663
Which one do we use?

1179
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:01,099
Uh, that one! That one!
That one! Come on!

1180
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:03,001
Go, go, go, go, go!

1181
01:07:03,067 --> 01:07:05,103
Wrap it around!

1182
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:07,740
Come on, guys!

1183
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:09,106
- Go, go!
- Go!

1184
01:07:09,173 --> 01:07:11,476
When we get in the tunnel,
I'll open the door!

1185
01:07:23,755 --> 01:07:26,156
We bought some distance
from the robots.

1186
01:07:26,224 --> 01:07:28,059
Not much, but some.

1187
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:29,928
Are there more on the way?

1188
01:07:29,994 --> 01:07:33,664
The AIs already sizing up how
much EMP firepower we have.

1189
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:36,634
It has to keep a radius until
it can figure that out.

1190
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:39,704
It's probably already
figured that out.

1191
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:41,707
Our electrical engineers
have installed

1192
01:07:41,773 --> 01:07:43,875
a punch code lock
in the south doors

1193
01:07:43,942 --> 01:07:45,844
to the electrical
distribution room.

1194
01:07:45,909 --> 01:07:49,813
It's an analog lock, a fail-safe
in case of a major power outage.

1195
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,850
It's also protected by
an electromagnetic shield.

1196
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:57,255
Your heartbeat can't be
detected once you're in there.

1197
01:07:57,322 --> 01:07:59,458
Once we're inside the building,

1198
01:07:59,525 --> 01:08:01,860
we need to access
the main programming room

1199
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:03,595
to access MEDUSA.

1200
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:04,995
I can enter the coding.

1201
01:08:05,063 --> 01:08:07,465
There's a lot
of ground to cover.

1202
01:08:07,532 --> 01:08:09,835
And what if we can't stop it?

1203
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:14,672
What if we can't stop it?

1204
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:17,375
The three of us may die trying.

1205
01:08:17,442 --> 01:08:19,644
But if we stop MEDUSA,
the world lives.

1206
01:08:19,711 --> 01:08:23,115
If we don't,
if we do something wrong,

1207
01:08:23,181 --> 01:08:26,550
MEDUSA lives and the world dies.

1208
01:08:26,618 --> 01:08:28,954
Either way,
there's no turning back.

1209
01:08:31,488 --> 01:08:32,924
Let's finish this.

1210
01:08:35,927 --> 01:08:38,729
We're gonna pass
three security cameras.

1211
01:08:38,796 --> 01:08:41,399
Once we pass the first one,
it's gonna trigger an alarm

1212
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:43,835
and MEDUSA will send
the robots to stop us.

1213
01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:46,136
If we can enter into
the program room fast enough,

1214
01:08:46,203 --> 01:08:49,807
then we could shut the
steel door and get to work.

1215
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,342
And hope that ARES
doesn't break through

1216
01:08:51,409 --> 01:08:52,778
before you finish the hack?

1217
01:08:55,113 --> 01:08:58,150
I'll hit it with a powerful
kill-all switch and distract it.

1218
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,121
What's that?

1219
01:09:03,255 --> 01:09:05,123
Um, dog tags.

1220
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:08,960
Red Dragon and her
cousin Derek gave us.

1221
01:09:09,027 --> 01:09:13,832
Tara was wearing them
when we were attacked.

1222
01:09:16,467 --> 01:09:17,603
Wait.

1223
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:22,474
I need some time
to enter the Sysconfig

1224
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:26,144
and turn off the analog motors

1225
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:27,846
and switch the capacheats.

1226
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:35,519
[alarm blaring]

1227
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:37,422
The programming
center's just ahead.

1228
01:09:37,488 --> 01:09:38,989
Look, if the ARES robots
start firing,

1229
01:09:39,056 --> 01:09:41,925
you shield Wilson,
but don't stop firing back!

1230
01:09:41,993 --> 01:09:43,762
Now wait here!

1231
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:46,330
<i>Access denied.</i>

1232
01:09:46,398 --> 01:09:47,766
It's denying my security access.

1233
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:49,635
Shut it off manually!

1234
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:51,936
We'll have to get into the wall,
but we don't have the tools!

1235
01:09:52,002 --> 01:09:53,171
Oh, I got this!

1236
01:09:57,842 --> 01:09:58,809
Hurry!

1237
01:09:58,877 --> 01:10:00,746
Which one trips the shut-off?

1238
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:01,947
I'll cut them all!

1239
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:06,117
<i>Access granted.</i>

1240
01:10:07,217 --> 01:10:08,653
Let's go.

1241
01:10:10,555 --> 01:10:12,824
<i>Closing shield doors.</i>

1242
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,658
All right, there's a large
port on the back of the console.

1243
01:10:14,725 --> 01:10:16,693
You can access MEDUSA
directly from there.

1244
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:17,896
Right, right, right!

1245
01:10:19,463 --> 01:10:21,166
What is that?

1246
01:10:23,234 --> 01:10:26,103
That's the NFX,
a rescue robot Dr. Lopez,

1247
01:10:26,171 --> 01:10:28,974
Dr. Marietta and I were working
on to help rescue people.

1248
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:30,542
It was designed
to pull people

1249
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:32,143
from collapsed buildings
in disaster areas.

1250
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:34,645
We pulled it offline once
MEDUSA malfunctioned.

1251
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:38,617
You hear that?

1252
01:10:38,682 --> 01:10:40,551
<i>Access granted.</i>

1253
01:10:40,618 --> 01:10:42,520
The door!

1254
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:48,126
Ah!

1255
01:10:55,634 --> 01:11:00,872
Wilson, you cannot stop this.

1256
01:11:00,939 --> 01:11:02,774
Jorge!

1257
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,676
Ah!

1258
01:11:04,743 --> 01:11:07,512
Jorge! Jorge! Jorge!
No, no, no!

1259
01:11:07,578 --> 01:11:08,512
Jorge!
Jorge!

1260
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:09,514
Help him!

1261
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:10,515
Jorge, come on, man!

1262
01:11:10,582 --> 01:11:11,817
Come on, wake up, Jorge!

1263
01:11:11,882 --> 01:11:13,050
- Jorge?
- Keep the pressure on it!

1264
01:11:13,117 --> 01:11:14,552
- Keep the pressure on!
- Jorge!

1265
01:11:14,618 --> 01:11:17,021
Jorge, come on, can you hear me?
Jorge!

1266
01:11:17,087 --> 01:11:20,291
MEDUSA is about to take over
the world's military weapons!

1267
01:11:20,358 --> 01:11:22,159
Doctor, Doctor, hand me the
tablet! Hand me the tablet!

1268
01:11:22,226 --> 01:11:23,360
Here, here, here.

1269
01:11:23,427 --> 01:11:24,863
- All right.
- Come on!

1270
01:11:24,929 --> 01:11:27,632
That was Tara's dad's
quantum tablet.

1271
01:11:27,698 --> 01:11:29,634
But once you start
entering the code,

1272
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:30,969
it's going to start
trying to hack

1273
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,570
the quantum firewall
on that tablet.

1274
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:35,405
- Oh...
- Hang in there, buddy.

1275
01:11:35,472 --> 01:11:38,309
The kill-all virus will take a
few seconds for it to stop it.

1276
01:11:38,376 --> 01:11:42,713
But that'll give me just enough
time to enter in the data bomb.

1277
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,981
MEDUSA's system will shut down

1278
01:11:44,048 --> 01:11:45,649
and stop its systems
from frying.

1279
01:11:45,716 --> 01:11:48,351
But that'll give me
enough time to go at it.

1280
01:11:48,418 --> 01:11:50,188
Hurry...

1281
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:58,596
<i>MEDUSA has entered
standby mode.</i>

1282
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,109
Is it...

1283
01:12:12,176 --> 01:12:14,313
No, not yet.

1284
01:12:14,378 --> 01:12:16,247
It wouldn't work that fast.

1285
01:12:18,082 --> 01:12:19,683
We were seconds away
from MEDUSA

1286
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:22,119
taking over
the world's nuclear arsenal.

1287
01:12:23,188 --> 01:12:24,590
Hey...

1288
01:12:26,023 --> 01:12:28,293
- Hey.
- Oh, welcome back.

1289
01:12:30,795 --> 01:12:32,663
Oh, man, dude.

1290
01:12:32,729 --> 01:12:34,431
They shot this at you.

1291
01:12:34,498 --> 01:12:36,667
- Really?
- Yeah.

1292
01:12:38,536 --> 01:12:40,505
Why is it still blinking?

1293
01:12:40,572 --> 01:12:42,106
What?

1294
01:12:42,173 --> 01:12:43,207
Let me see that.

1295
01:12:45,109 --> 01:12:46,277
Doctor?

1296
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:51,382
MEDUSA transferred
her AI into this...

1297
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:58,288
Oh!

1298
01:12:58,355 --> 01:12:59,322
Come on, come on, come on!

1299
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:00,792
Come on!

1300
01:13:49,974 --> 01:13:51,710
[Jorge] Why isn't it dead?

1301
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:53,211
MEDUSA transferred
itself to another system!

1302
01:13:53,277 --> 01:13:55,980
- What system?
- It's just gone!

1303
01:13:56,046 --> 01:13:58,315
Look, the kill-all virus
should have slowed it down.

1304
01:13:58,381 --> 01:14:03,454
But MEDUSA transmitted itself
to a different mainframe.

1305
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,157
That shouldn't be
possible unless it...

1306
01:14:06,224 --> 01:14:08,059
unless it...

1307
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:09,860
it changed itself
once it deployed.

1308
01:14:09,927 --> 01:14:12,730
Oh, man, that means it wouldn't
have slowed it down at all.

1309
01:14:12,797 --> 01:14:15,899
So your virus didn't
kill it at all?

1310
01:14:15,966 --> 01:14:18,502
It turned into
a modular firewall.

1311
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:20,470
It didn't slow it down.

1312
01:14:20,537 --> 01:14:21,706
I helped it escape.

1313
01:14:29,581 --> 01:14:31,315
I need help.

1314
01:14:31,381 --> 01:14:32,616
Come on, come on,
we're taking you outside.

1315
01:14:32,684 --> 01:14:34,085
No, no.

1316
01:14:34,152 --> 01:14:35,720
Just set me down in front
of the computer here.

1317
01:14:35,786 --> 01:14:37,389
- Be more use here.
- All right.

1318
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:43,961
So what's the plan?

1319
01:14:44,028 --> 01:14:46,364
MEDUSA is not going anywhere.

1320
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:49,467
And what makes you think that?

1321
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:51,368
Because she still wants us dead.

1322
01:14:53,337 --> 01:14:56,674
There's only so much tech
with a sliding base

1323
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:00,144
parallel to her Qbit shell.

1324
01:15:00,211 --> 01:15:03,748
It has to be hiding
in the machine at Spaceport.

1325
01:15:04,682 --> 01:15:05,615
I'll find it.

1326
01:15:05,682 --> 01:15:06,984
No.

1327
01:15:07,051 --> 01:15:07,986
You click one
button on that computer,

1328
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:10,688
MEDUSA will find you.

1329
01:15:10,755 --> 01:15:12,490
Stay here.
I'll look.

1330
01:15:12,556 --> 01:15:14,057
Reinforce the door
and turn your radio on

1331
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:15,993
just in case I need you
to go online.

1332
01:15:18,762 --> 01:15:19,965
I'm coming with you.

1333
01:15:35,747 --> 01:15:38,115
[explosion]

1334
01:15:40,385 --> 01:15:41,787
[explosion]

1335
01:15:49,261 --> 01:15:50,362
Found it.

1336
01:15:54,865 --> 01:15:56,868
MEDUSA's in that?

1337
01:15:56,935 --> 01:15:58,302
That?

1338
01:15:58,368 --> 01:15:59,304
Yep.

1339
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,842
Run!

1340
01:16:13,885 --> 01:16:15,019
We need to split up!

1341
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:16,421
No, we need a plan!

1342
01:16:18,855 --> 01:16:20,190
I have a plan!

1343
01:16:20,256 --> 01:16:22,460
All right,
turn on your radio!

1344
01:16:22,525 --> 01:16:24,161
All right.

1345
01:16:24,228 --> 01:16:26,764
All right, listen for my orders
and get the ARES to follow you!

1346
01:16:26,831 --> 01:16:28,365
- Okay?
- Got it.

1347
01:16:46,684 --> 01:16:48,220
Ah!

1348
01:16:57,427 --> 01:16:58,997
[static]

1349
01:17:00,297 --> 01:17:02,434
Dr. Marietta!
Dr. Marietta!

1350
01:17:04,702 --> 01:17:06,904
All right, I'm here.

1351
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,738
MEDUSA is in
the NFX rescue robot!

1352
01:17:08,805 --> 01:17:12,476
You said you'd get here and map
a mainframe to help me.

1353
01:17:12,543 --> 01:17:14,412
Well, now's your chance!

1354
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:16,614
Lead me to MEDUSA's new brain.

1355
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,215
All right, mapping now.

1356
01:17:20,518 --> 01:17:21,618
Have you found it yet?

1357
01:17:21,685 --> 01:17:23,420
Have you found it yet?
Do a heat scan,

1358
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:26,024
see where most
of the heat is generating.

1359
01:17:27,524 --> 01:17:30,094
All right, the
mainframe is located

1360
01:17:30,161 --> 01:17:32,463
in the chest cavity
of the robot.

1361
01:17:35,065 --> 01:17:36,967
I knew it!

1362
01:17:37,034 --> 01:17:38,202
What?

1363
01:17:39,304 --> 01:17:42,407
Wilson!
Wilson!

1364
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:44,942
Jorge?

1365
01:17:45,009 --> 01:17:46,211
Jorge, can you hear me?

1366
01:17:50,047 --> 01:17:51,448
Oh...

1367
01:17:56,287 --> 01:17:57,689
Ah!

1368
01:18:02,393 --> 01:18:03,395
Wilson?

1369
01:18:05,496 --> 01:18:06,297
Wilson?

1370
01:18:06,363 --> 01:18:08,231
<i>Jorge, are you okay?</i>

1371
01:18:08,298 --> 01:18:10,134
<i>Yeah, I'll live.</i>

1372
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:12,069
Are you in an area where you
can make a lot of noise?

1373
01:18:12,136 --> 01:18:14,339
<i>Uh, yeah, I think so.</i>

1374
01:18:14,404 --> 01:18:17,708
I need you to lure
the ARES robots away.

1375
01:18:17,775 --> 01:18:18,975
Can you do that?

1376
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:21,211
<i>Yes.
Yeah, I can do that.</i>

1377
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:23,014
<i>Hey! Hey, robots,
I'm down here!</i>

1378
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:25,283
<i>Come and get me!</i>

1379
01:18:51,176 --> 01:18:52,576
I'm in!

1380
01:18:52,643 --> 01:18:54,779
<i>Good.
Where's you friend, Jorge?</i>

1381
01:18:54,845 --> 01:18:56,314
Hopefully safe.

1382
01:18:58,882 --> 01:19:00,951
Robots!
Hey!

1383
01:19:01,018 --> 01:19:02,153
Wilson!

1384
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:05,422
Oh, no.

1385
01:19:09,761 --> 01:19:11,730
How far are you?

1386
01:19:12,796 --> 01:19:14,030
Close, I hope!

1387
01:19:14,097 --> 01:19:15,932
What are you trying to do?

1388
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,600
This thing's got a brain.

1389
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:19,702
Well, I'm about to
give it a heart.

1390
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:21,973
What, make it nicer?

1391
01:19:22,038 --> 01:19:23,774
No. Make it a target.

1392
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:28,413
What's that?

1393
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:30,781
We are running out of time here.

1394
01:19:38,588 --> 01:19:40,158
I'm here!

1395
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:49,300
I'm in front of the motherboard
and I'm prying it open!

1396
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,201
All right, once you pull
that processor,

1397
01:19:51,268 --> 01:19:52,604
we can hack it directly.

1398
01:19:56,306 --> 01:19:57,675
<i>All right, it's out!</i>

1399
01:19:57,742 --> 01:20:00,744
Wilson, it knows
you're inside the robot.

1400
01:20:00,811 --> 01:20:03,213
<i>MEDUSA is launching
nukes across the globe.</i>

1401
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,048
<i>It's now or never.</i>

1402
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:08,019
<i>Yeah, well, now it's going to
have my heartbeat inside of it!</i>

1403
01:20:08,085 --> 01:20:11,387
<i>And every robot within firing
distance is going to detect it</i>

1404
01:20:11,454 --> 01:20:13,091
<i>and shred this thing!</i>

1405
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:16,960
<i>I've got it!
It's coming from the intercom!</i>

1406
01:20:17,028 --> 01:20:19,030
<i>It's feeding into the system
as an algorithm!</i>

1407
01:20:19,095 --> 01:20:21,465
All right. Climb inside
the steel reinforced casing

1408
01:20:21,532 --> 01:20:22,734
and hurry!

1409
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,762
MEDUSA is transmitting
your heartbeat

1410
01:20:50,828 --> 01:20:52,630
to every robot in the world.

1411
01:20:52,697 --> 01:20:55,565
<i>The robots think it's
a living human being now!</i>

1412
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:58,735
<i>It'll use every robot
to attack itself!</i>

1413
01:20:58,802 --> 01:21:02,873
<i>It's working, Wilson, but
you're still inside the target.</i>

1414
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:04,141
<i>Brace yourself.</i>

1415
01:21:29,832 --> 01:21:30,934
<i>Come in, Wilson.</i>

1416
01:21:31,002 --> 01:21:32,403
<i>Wilson?
Are you okay?</i>

1417
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:38,809
I'm on my way.

1418
01:22:36,199 --> 01:22:37,668
A little help here, guys?

1419
01:22:39,603 --> 01:22:42,472
Zee! Oh, my God!
You're both alive!

1420
01:22:43,774 --> 01:22:44,976
Barely.

1421
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:50,881
That was just...

1422
01:22:50,948 --> 01:22:53,618
Well...

1423
01:22:53,685 --> 01:22:54,953
Yeah.

1424
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:58,656
Yeah, yeah.

1425
01:23:00,724 --> 01:23:03,595
I'm proud of you.
You did it!

1426
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:07,364
I always told you,
you're all heart.

1427
01:23:09,867 --> 01:23:11,703
So what do we do now?

1428
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:17,674
There's a lot of work to do.

1429
01:23:20,344 --> 01:23:21,779
Where do we start?

1430
01:23:24,448 --> 01:23:25,649
Just log in.

1431
01:23:27,018 --> 01:23:28,353
Just log in.
