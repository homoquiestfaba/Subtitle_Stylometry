1
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:04,180
(gentle music)

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,120
(computer keys clicking)

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,100
- [Kenny] Okay, so I
just add account, right?

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,010
- [Harry] Yeah, just
hit the little plus sign

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,360
in the upper corner there.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,160
- Now this is where I get into
trouble. Configure settings?

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,660
- It's not a scary
thing at all, I promise.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,160
Just click on the other
open tab where we found

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,490
that server name, good.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,830
Now copy that.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,400
(keys clicking)

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,283
- This one?

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,660
- Yeah, now just paste
that in the server name

14
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,860
on the other page here.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,006
And enter your username and password.

16
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,723
(keys clicking)

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,843
Now just hit import.

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,963
And, voila.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,900
- Harry, you're a lifesaver.

20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,400
I can never get these damn email settings.

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,080
- Oh, sure you could.

22
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,630
There's plenty of videos online that would

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,463
walk you through it.

24
00:00:57,513 --> 00:00:59,450
- It's not the same, and by
the time I would have figured

25
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,860
it out, there'd be another software update

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,530
and then I'd have to start all over again.

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,830
- My dear Kenny, you
should know by now that all

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,496
of life's questions have been
answered in YouTube videos.

29
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:12,410
You do not need people
like me around anymore.

30
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,840
- YouTube would have
taken me at least an hour.

31
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,510
With you, it took minutes.

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,523
I think that's incredibly valuable.

33
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,310
- I should get going.

34
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,820
- No, it's so early.

35
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,120
I mean, what do you have
to do at your place?

36
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,830
- Nothing special, I guess.

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,880
- Exactly, I mean, how much
Farmville can you play in a day?

38
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:35,694
(soft jazz music)

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,420
- My brother is just...

40
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,253
- Lex.

41
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,583
- No. This is ridiculous.

42
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,680
He's pretending to be
Shane's friend so he could

43
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,010
Hollywood hustle him into
writing that miniseries

44
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,124
about his stupid life.

45
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:53,580
- He's not gonna be here much longer.

46
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,530
Couple more days and he leaves.

47
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,280
- That's what you said last
week, but he's still here.

48
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,050
Look at this.

49
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,950
He turned the AC on even though
it isn't even hot inside.

50
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,120
No wonder I'm getting headaches.

51
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,250
The barometric pressure in
here is all over the place.

52
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,100
- Stomping around with a negative attitude

53
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,083
isn't gonna make the time go faster.

54
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,860
- Whenever I ask Shane to go
see a movie or go for a hike,

55
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,460
he's busy writing a screenplay.

56
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,889
But of course he's got plenty of time

57
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:25,430
to lounge around the pool with him.

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,430
- So is that when you
auditioned for "Jurassic World"?

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,580
- I didn't audition for "Jurassic World."

60
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,250
I turned down the part when
I asked for script rewrites.

61
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,480
I refused to sully my brand
with substandard writing.

62
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,090
Lex, I invited Ed and
Bev to come over tonight.

63
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,590
Thought we'd have a little party.

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,370
- Fine, but Shane and I won't be here.

65
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,253
- We won't?

66
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,366
- We're going to see the silent

67
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,293
Warhol film retrospective downtown.

68
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,510
- Why didn't you say something?

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,393
- I did.

70
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,673
- That's okay. Lex and I
can see them another night.

71
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,830
- Whatever.

72
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,880
It's only playing there tonight, though.

73
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,910
- What was I saying?

74
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,020
- You were telling Shane how we met.

75
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,520
- Ah, it was like an '80s sitcom.

76
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,020
We were both reaching for the last package

77
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,350
of gluten-free pasta at Whole Foods.

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,470
- It was a hard-fought
battle, but in the end,

79
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,870
the rigatoni was mine.

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,610
- Only on the condition she
was to have dinner with me,

81
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,443
even though I didn't know a thing

82
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:28,400
about the Office of Foreign Missions.

83
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,320
- What did you talk about over dinner?

84
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,500
- Talk?

85
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,450
By the time he was grating the Parmesan,

86
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,073
I had my tongue in his ear.

87
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,060
- I still see it as a
sign from the universe

88
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,860
that we stop in to visit Lex

89
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,640
and he has a screenwriter
renting the guesthouse.

90
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,750
- Well I'm trying to write.
I'm mostly flailing, though.

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,690
- There is a lot of
interest in my life story

92
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,603
to be adapted into a miniseries.

93
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:58,080
Could even lead to a bidding
war with the studios.

94
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,520
- Do studios still have bidding wars?

95
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,560
- Of course they do,
if the material's good,

96
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,000
bulletproof good.

97
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,640
- [Shane] That's very true.

98
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,380
Lord knows you have plenty of stories.

99
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,880
- Some of them are even true.

100
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,423
- Okay then. Off the record.

101
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,050
Did you really go skinny dipping with, uh,

102
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,963
what was her name, the
right-wing congresswoman,

103
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,530
just so you could tip off the
press to take photos of it?

104
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,033
- What a memory that was.

105
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,640
Calistoga Hot Springs, one of
my favorite places on Earth.

106
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,430
It's where Laura and I were headed

107
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,730
when I decided to drop in on Lex.

108
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,780
I haven't seen him since he,
you know, took the pills.

109
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,590
God, that was

110
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,833
six, eight months ago?

111
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,410
I had no idea what Lex would do for love,

112
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,973
or the lack of it.

113
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:57,911
I don't know.

114
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:01,447
I guess if you never had
something, then you experience it,

115
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:03,153
and it's taken away...

116
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,004
Is it

117
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:09,783
that hard being gay these days?

118
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,470
- Now you're gripping
the cue way too tight.

119
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,093
Try and relax it a little bit.

120
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:21,740
- But now it feels like a wet noodle.

121
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,197
- Well just try and keep a
smooth motion with it then.

122
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:27,373
But don't take your eye of it.

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,323
- Kenny, this is good.

124
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,600
Darren thinks he can get
me an offer on the house.

125
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,800
- Really? That's great.

126
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,797
- It's below my asking, but
after everything's paid off

127
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,280
there should still be enough to put

128
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,230
a down payment on a condo in LA.

129
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,713
- Lower than asking.

130
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:46,230
I mean, I could get your
asking price for my place,

131
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,610
and it's half the land you've got.

132
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,390
- Can't afford to be picky in this market.

133
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,476
Just happy someone's interested.

134
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:55,450
- I would hate to see you
just give the place away.

135
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,763
I mean, I can lend you what you need.

136
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,433
- No, Harry. Thank you, though.

137
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,670
You know you've been so
good to me through all this.

138
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,894
But I have to try and get my own life.

139
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:12,863
- Back to LA? What will you do there?

140
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,052
- Well, I don't know.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,033
I maybe get back into acting,

142
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,863
or voice-over work.

143
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,850
Or sometimes I even think
about going back to school,

144
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,380
to be a therapist, but

145
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,170
I don't know.

146
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,580
- Lex, did you get a chance to read those

147
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,980
new pages I emailed to you?

148
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,191
- I did.

149
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,009
They're wonderful.

150
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,210
- Eh, I don't know.

151
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,530
The more I think about
them, the more I hate them.

152
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,413
- You're wrong.

153
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,730
The story's vivid. It
makes me wanna read more.

154
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,523
- I just wanna start over, again.

155
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,483
- You can't delete everything you write.

156
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,520
No wonder you're running outta Xanax.

157
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,970
- It's just that I was
supposed to be finished by now.

158
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,130
Labor Day is next week.

159
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,899
I have to be back to work the day after.

160
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,920
(lid closing)

161
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,993
- You need to stop letting
my brother seduce you.

162
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,287
- I don't know.

163
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,473
His life could be a compelling
miniseries for sure.

164
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,193
- That's crap.

165
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,833
There's nothing compelling
about a superficial existence.

166
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,370
You know, he got into the
industry through our mother,

167
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,320
who married an abusive psychopath

168
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,220
that used to beat us up all the time.

169
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,500
You think that's original?

170
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,630
Was it the shooting?

171
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,733
Trust me, that wasn't
compelling. It was pathetic.

172
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,823
It's a CSI episode at best.

173
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,430
- Maybe it's that he came
through the other side.

174
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,263
He's a survivor.

175
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:52,120
The screenplay I'm writing
is about surviving.

176
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,530
- Nice that he can get on with this life,

177
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,380
but I got stuck with the nightmares.

178
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,440
- Excuse me, um, David was
just gonna jump in the pool,

179
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,990
and I was wondering where
I could find the towels.

180
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,620
- Sure. Fresh out the dryer.

181
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,503
- Thanks.

182
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,173
David had a lot of trauma
over that awful event.

183
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,117
He doesn't show it, but

184
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,833
anyway, thanks.

185
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,800
- Hearing loss in his
left ear from the gunshot.

186
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,360
Noise trauma, poor guy.

187
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,310
- The only point I was trying to make,

188
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:38,793
believe me, I didn't want to upset you,

189
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,990
is that some people are survivors,

190
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,330
and others get crushed
by life's tragedies,

191
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,383
and this is simply one of
the cruelties of living.

192
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,013
- I get that.

193
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,030
And in your screenplay,
you develop that idea

194
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,513
with depth and insight,
which makes it moving.

195
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:04,460
But the story of a
14-year-old boy who kills

196
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,833
his stepfather is sleazy.

197
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,813
The trial was sleazy, and
the lawyers were sleazy.

198
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,660
And my brother was totally disconnected

199
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,210
from what I was going through.

200
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,250
- I'm sorry. Really, I, I should...

201
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,653
- I'm sorry. It just hit a nerve.

202
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,890
I'll get you my notes on
those pages. And they're good.

203
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,947
I'm not gonna let you delete them.

204
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:38,310
(soft jazz music)

205
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:53,360
- I didn't know you were a pool player.

206
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,463
- It's all a ruse to hustle Harry here.

207
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,410
- Did you ever get a chance to listen

208
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,260
to that Spotify playlist I sent you?

209
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,393
- Yeah, yeah, I did. I loved it.

210
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,473
I listen to it all the time.
Just last night in fact.

211
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,770
- Did I hear you say your
screenplay was about survival?

212
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,820
- Yeah, I mean it is in the
metaphorical sense, I guess.

213
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,320
But really it's about, you
know, it's about everything.

214
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,813
- [Harry] Oh, so it's
Wikipedia in script form.

215
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,763
- I'm gonna read Lex's feedback
and get some work done.

216
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,610
- Harry, you're a better man than that.

217
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,070
- [Harry] We don't need
another story about survivors.

218
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,360
We have 40 seasons of
that damn reality series.

219
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,060
- Lex says he's talented.

220
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,820
- Well, if he's the next William Goldman,

221
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,930
why doesn't he have an agent?

222
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,033
What's he doing wasting his
time up here in Silicon Valley?

223
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,040
It's because writing 10-second quips

224
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,143
for social media sites
is more within his grasp.

225
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,043
- I don't get it.

226
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:08,600
You are the sweetest man in
the world, and you can't bring

227
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,863
yourself to say one
nice thing about Shane?

228
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,100
- Oh, he's okay. I don't
mean to say he's a bad guy.

229
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,343
It's just...

230
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:23,393
Just burns me that Lex gets
so wooed by his mediocrity.

231
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:30,587
Shane hasn't done a thing
to earn Lex's adoring gaze.

232
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,520
- Careful, you're sounding jealous.

233
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,920
- Oh, what's the difference?

234
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,373
Lex seems determined to move away anyhow.

235
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,633
- I thought that might be bothering you.

236
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,410
- I'm glad you didn't
see him at the beginning

237
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,160
of the year when he first came up.

238
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,553
He was in such a bad way.

239
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,530
Needed someone to take care of him.

240
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,820
That's how I remember it anyway.

241
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,701
- He's still fragile.

242
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,600
- All those long afternoons
together, cold evenings,

243
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,843
hot chocolate, Netflix.

244
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,800
I really loved watching him gain strength

245
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,773
and begin to enjoy things
more, even the little things.

246
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,090
I remember one night we
went to the movies and

247
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,680
I dropped Lex off and went
home and I was getting ready

248
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,827
for bed, and I realized that I missed him.

249
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,010
I mean, I couldn't wait to
see him the next day and

250
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,783
that's when I knew I never
wanted him to leave here.

251
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:53,527
- Oh, Harry.

252
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:58,860
- I never said anything to him, I promise.

253
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,660
I mean, he'd just been
through an awful time

254
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,233
and wasn't really over it and

255
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,010
I didn't think it was wise to let him know

256
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,627
that someone had become dependent on him.

257
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:15,246
I didn't wa...

258
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:18,660
I didn't wanna say anything
that would frighten

259
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,750
or confuse him, I mean, my God,

260
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,443
I'm old enough to be his father.

261
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,273
And I never saw myself as the daddy type.

262
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,163
So I just hedged and procrastinated

263
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:38,073
and obsessed over him.

264
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,033
Trying to find the right
time to tell him how I felt.

265
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,166
And I was really getting close,

266
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,430
when suddenly he's head over heels in love

267
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,603
with his handsome, sensitive,

268
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,583
younger,

269
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,393
tenant.

270
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,950
Who's taken up residence in Lex's heart

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,703
in addition to his guesthouse.

272
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,180
- I could see how having
Shane here for the past six

273
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,580
or seven weeks, just the two of them,

274
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,780
even though he's in the guesthouse,

275
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:25,870
how he could fall hard for him.

276
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
- Never thought I could feel
this way after Robert died.

277
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,513
- [Shane] Kenny, your phone's
ringing. It's your husband.

278
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,151
(Kenny sighing)

279
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:57,658
(crickets chirping)

280
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,193
- Lex has changed towards me.

281
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,873
He used to look up to me.

282
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,230
Playing out scenes from famous movies,

283
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,433
his Gloria Swanson to my William Holden.

284
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,563
Told me I was the best big brother ever.

285
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,353
Now he's just so, angry.

286
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,560
What do you think?

287
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,093
Justin Timberlake? Pierce Brosnan?

288
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,483
- Brosnan. Keep it classy tonight.

289
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,230
- You're the boss.

290
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,113
- Oh.

291
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,943
I'll be your wife, but not your boss.

292
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,997
Or your mother.

293
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,270
(lips smacking)

294
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,563
- Man, am I lucky I let
you have that pasta.

295
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,880
You are the only woman
I ever met that I just

296
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,813
knew, knew I was going to marry.

297
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,553
- What about all those
models and actresses?

298
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:20,650
- Nothing. Just nothing.

299
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,240
I can prove it, because when they wanted

300
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,180
to get married, I said no.

301
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,600
- You are so full of shit.

302
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,633
- I'm serious. Ask my manager.

303
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,230
- Doesn't matter.

304
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,537
I still feel like the lucky one.

305
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,013
- Now who's full of shit?

306
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,360
David Frasier is a brand
that's disintegrating.

307
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,090
The acting offers are drying
up. Debts aren't getting paid.

308
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,947
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, I told you.

309
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,633
The whole is greater than
the sum of the parts.

310
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,323
- Thank you.

311
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,043
Maryann Williamson.

312
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,470
- Oh, sorry.

313
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,290
- No, come in. It's fine.

314
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,770
- [Lex] You were looking for this jacket?

315
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,140
- [David] Yeah.

316
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,250
Decided on a different look, though,

317
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,560
so I don't think I'll wear it.

318
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,443
You put it on.

319
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,593
That's a cool jacket.

320
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:24,244
Oh, looks good on you. Where'd you get it?

321
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,760
- You gave it to me, remember?

322
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,993
- I did? Damn, I've got good taste.

323
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,190
- I think David looks so handsome
channeling Pierce Brosnan.

324
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,180
- He looks great, always does.

325
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,830
- Try and have some fun tonight.

326
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:42,900
You've been living like
a hermit for months.

327
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,930
- I haven't been a hermit.

328
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,250
I leave the house.

329
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,693
- Oh yeah, Warhol Silent Film
Festival, a thrill a minute.

330
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:55,180
I just want you to think
of tonight as a chance to

331
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,100
put the past behind you.

332
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,803
What's done is done, right?

333
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,573
- It's easy to say.

334
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,523
- This will be more fun than
going to the movies with Shane.

335
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:10,833
Is he a good screenwriter?

336
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,323
Seriously, could he write the miniseries?

337
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,890
- Jesus, the miniseries.

338
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,340
- I've been offered good money for it,

339
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,380
which indirectly means
you're in for a taste too

340
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,570
if you play along.

341
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,453
- Here we go.

342
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,240
Shane's trying to write
a serious movie script.

343
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,730
You shouldn't be distracting him.

344
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,410
- I'm not.

345
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,853
He's the one who's always
asking me questions.

346
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,241
- I don't think you should
make your life story public.

347
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,030
- Why? I'm not ashamed of my life.

348
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,140
- It'll be done tastefully,

349
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,980
and David's not lying about the offers.

350
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,840
- Then he should find
someone else to write it.

351
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,990
And please, leave me and Mom out of it.

352
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,200
- I can't leave you out of it.

353
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,030
That's the part all the studios

354
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,920
are going to be interested in.

355
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,310
- Well, you're exploiting
in me in an ugly situation

356
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,460
just to keep what's left
of your career going.

357
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,150
- Jesus, you've become
such a drama queen lately.

358
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,830
You're in charge of your life, not me.

359
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,373
Take it by the horns.
Make something happen.

360
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:14,000
- I'm sorry, not everyone's as energetic

361
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,840
and enlightened as you are.

362
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,890
- David's done a lot of work on himself.

363
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,760
- You were such a promising kid.

364
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,843
Bright, creative.

365
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,023
You had my good looks.

366
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,060
I'd kill for your height.

367
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,210
And since being gay is a plus in Hollywood

368
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,460
these days, you could leverage it.

369
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,210
Gotta do something about all that.

370
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,620
And there are still
certain casting agents,

371
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,490
you could make abandon
their ethics, you know.

372
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,833
- Even if that was meant as a compliment,

373
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,893
I don't exactly feel ready
for prime time these days.

374
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,983
- Shane thinks you're adorable.

375
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,183
And he's right.

376
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,053
- No.

377
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,244
Really?

378
00:20:01,294 --> 00:20:03,773
- Oh yeah, always complimenting you.

379
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:09,190
- He's just being polite.

380
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,610
- No, I've heard him over
the last couple of days.

381
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,943
Said your notes have
been, incredibly helpful.

382
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,482
Where you going?

383
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:20,816
- I'm going to make
sure the hors-d'oeuvres

384
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,160
are put together.

385
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,910
- [David] Nothing too weird, okay?

386
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,113
- No weirder than us.

387
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,990
(door closing)

388
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:42,315
- You're really into Shane, aren't you?

389
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:44,989
- I don't know.

390
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,663
Yeah, I guess I am.

391
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,873
- Well, just, play cool with him.

392
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,980
Don't let your desperation show.

393
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,150
- I don't think I have.

394
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,760
Wait, you think I'm being desperate?

395
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,760
- I just remember with the last boyfriend

396
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,880
where you constantly texted
him, sent him little gifts.

397
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,400
- That's a total exaggeration.

398
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,720
- I don't think Stephen would
have ghosted you so quickly

399
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,380
if he hadn't felt so, smothered.

400
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,020
It was pretty obvious.

401
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,123
- His name was Scott.

402
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:20,080
You were never around, so
you don't know what happened.

403
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,650
- Don't get so defensive.

404
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,730
Just basing it on the time
I saw you two together,

405
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,940
and I'm not saying anything different

406
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,690
than all those high-priced
psychiatrists have said.

407
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,493
When it comes to guys, you
probably self-sabotage,

408
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,803
trip over your own feet, you know?

409
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:38,853
- I probably am.

410
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:43,355
- Oh man.

411
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:49,494
Look at me.

412
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,210
40 years old, and might as well be 400

413
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,060
as far as the studios are concerned.

414
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,233
When I was younger, times were good.

415
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,830
The offers I could turn
down, the phone calls

416
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,023
I could ignore, all the agents wanting me.

417
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:16,830
I couldn't tell you
when the hustle started

418
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,653
to get so, tough.

419
00:22:22,702 --> 00:22:24,870
When you know you still
have passion and ability,

420
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,860
and you have to work so hard to get anyone

421
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,713
to give two shits about you.

422
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,370
Sometimes I look at my face in the mirror

423
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,550
and I can't help noticing that something's

424
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:41,403
(sighs) missing.

425
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,660
Then I start to really sweat thinking it's

426
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,543
my

427
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:49,942
Future.

428
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:56,613
You're my younger brother and that's,

429
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,460
that's why I bust your balls about getting

430
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,080
your shit together
while there's still time

431
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,930
for you to make a life for yourself.

432
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:14,267
(bird calling)

433
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:17,317
(crickets chirping)

434
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:24,386
(Kenny sighing)

435
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:30,091
(storm brewing)

436
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:38,161
(phone clicking)

437
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,463
(phone pinging)

438
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:41,732
- Hey ya.

439
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:43,080
- Hey.

440
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,650
- I didn't mean to interrupt.

441
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,853
- No, it's nothing.

442
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
- I guess I'm early.

443
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:51,443
- Ed and Bev aren't here yet.

444
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,280
- You look good at
least. I love that shirt.

445
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,553
- Oh, well, my husband hates it.

446
00:23:58,593 --> 00:24:00,593
- Well I respectfully disagree with him.

447
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,750
- Normally, you can see
a ton of stars from here.

448
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,190
It's getting cloudy, though.
I wonder if it'll rain.

449
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,993
- That's fine by me. It
might cool things off.

450
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,923
- Let's hope.

451
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:20,280
(thunder cracking)

452
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,660
Wow, that's really thundering.

453
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,900
- It's nothing to be scared of.

454
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,993
- No, it's just unsettling.

455
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,330
- Well, you look great at least,

456
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,260
and I said that already, I'm so sorry.

457
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,133
- It's okay. I thanked you already.

458
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:39,870
(flames crackling)

459
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,100
- You know, I...
- Kenny, I...

460
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,530
- Oh, no I'm sorry.
- No, no, please go ahead.

461
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,890
- You looked like you were gonna...

462
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,193
- No, it's nothing.

463
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,260
(thunder cracking)

464
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,910
Sounds like it's getting closer.

465
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,773
- It does.

466
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,350
(flames crackling)

467
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,320
- So, who's the, um, influencer?

468
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,220
- The influencer?

469
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,673
Wow, how'd you know that?
Did we talk about that?

470
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,300
- I remember you said it might be

471
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,418
the title of your screenplay.

472
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:17,620
- No, it's just a working title really.

473
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,640
- Oh, I'm sorry. I thought...

474
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,323
- No, you're right.
That's the current title.

475
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,293
The influencer was my dad.

476
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,620
He was a mortgage broker
who lost everything

477
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,820
in the Great Recession.

478
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,583
He had to do all kinds of
things to keep us going.

479
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,160
- Like, what?

480
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,550
- Oh, like, he assembled products at home

481
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,120
and he sold them through Amazon.

482
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,240
He even played poker in Reno casinos

483
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,740
when money got really scarce.

484
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,540
- Sounds like an amazing guy.

485
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,423
- Yeah.

486
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:53,734
He was.

487
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,063
- Makes sense about what you said earlier,

488
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,123
being a survivor.

489
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,270
- Kenny, this summer went by too fast.

490
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,690
I mean, I know everything is fast now, but

491
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:17,820
I just, I was so excited
to finish this screenplay.

492
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,913
And between you and me, I
have made no progress on it.

493
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:26,689
- Is this the first time you've tried

494
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:27,841
to write a screenplay?

495
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:31,460
- No, I've written some spec
treatments for a few producers.

496
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,170
Published a few short stories.
Nothing very good, really.

497
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,690
I'd love to be able to
do it full time, but

498
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,520
that just seems like a pipe dream.

499
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,730
I get so distracted.

500
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,080
Other obligations, you know.

501
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,020
You don't wanna hear about all that.

502
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,903
It's draining.

503
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,180
- That's okay. Really I...

504
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,182
You know, Lex showed me
some of the short stories

505
00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:01,593
that you wrote and, I loved them.

506
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,010
They were wonderful.

507
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:07,090
(soft jazz music)

508
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,827
- It's weird. I've wanted to talk to you.

509
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:13,861
You know.

510
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,313
Really talk with you.

511
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,170
But, I think this is the
first time we've been alone.

512
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,993
- Nope. We spent that
afternoon together, remember?

513
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,860
- Oh, when I ran into you
at the farmers market?

514
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:37,947
Wasn't exactly private.
You can't count that.

515
00:27:39,818 --> 00:27:41,040
- It was just you and me.

516
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,923
We walked around a whole
afternoon together.

517
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:46,030
You didn't say anything.

518
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,773
- No, didn't, did I?

519
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,210
I was babbling about metaphor and satire,

520
00:27:55,731 --> 00:27:59,250
all the pretentious writer cliches, huh?

521
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,363
I felt awkward.

522
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:03,883
- Didn't, didn't show.

523
00:28:05,374 --> 00:28:06,738
- Huh.

524
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:07,820
At least it inspired me to put together

525
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,410
that Spotify playlist for you,

526
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,883
so the day wasn't a total loss.

527
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,730
- It's interesting because
I used to be totally in love

528
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,543
with this guy that just
idolized '90s modern rock.

529
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,430
It was a few years ago in Amsterdam

530
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,430
when I was visiting for the first time.

531
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,770
He was a DJ at this club
called the Queen's Head

532
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,257
in, uh, Zieg, Zieg Sta, Zieg, whatever.

533
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:42,450
And he was, so sexy, I just

534
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,280
had to go and talk to him.

535
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:50,710
(chuckles) It was my luck, of course,

536
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,533
he didn't speak a word of English.

537
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,710
And so we spent the next couple of weeks

538
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,900
trying to make each other
understand how we felt.

539
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,800
It ended up not even mattering

540
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,350
that we only knew a few words.

541
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,403
- Was it worth it? Even for a few weeks?

542
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:14,286
(soft jazz music)

543
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,073
- Absolutely. I'd do it again.

544
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,401
- If you weren't married, of course.

545
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:29,284
(soft jazz music)

546
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:35,433
(door opening)

547
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:36,953
(storm brewing)

548
00:29:37,003 --> 00:29:38,850
- Is that thunder I heard?

549
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,290
- Yes, still rattles me. I
don't care how harmless it is.

550
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,780
- We need the rain.

551
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,580
- We can have rain without thunder.

552
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,710
- Where is everybody?

553
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,260
- Do we count?

554
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:55,310
- So, how do I look? Nobody
say age-inappropriate.

555
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:56,832
- You look great.

556
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:57,990
- You look fine.

557
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,320
So, what time are the guests getting here?

558
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,440
- Any minute.

559
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,140
Let's get the outside lights
on and the pool lights.

560
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,857
Laura, the hors-doeuvres.

561
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:07,757
- Yep, coming up.

562
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,361
Where were you two earlier?

563
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,767
- Nothing, excuse me?

564
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:15,880
- You weren't out by the pool, were you?

565
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,573
That thunder's getting closer.

566
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:20,320
- [Shane] Ooh.

567
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,237
- Won't catch me out there tonight.

568
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,204
(footsteps fading)

569
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:35,834
(footsteps approaching)

570
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,077
- You guys, uh,

571
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,183
feeling adventurous?

572
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,073
Just some low-grade MDMA.

573
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,273
I took two.

574
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,760
Probably the last time I can let it fly

575
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,750
since I'm getting married.

576
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:02,407
Thought I'd offer it
to you guys and Harry.

577
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:06,833
- Well I mean it's been a while.

578
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,413
But what the hell?

579
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:13,953
- Uh, among friends, right?

580
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,923
- Let's party.

581
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,180
- [Laura] We should turn on some music.

582
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,973
- Good idea.

583
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,580
Where?

584
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,473
Ah, okay.

585
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:38,930
Darling, would you play DJ this evening?

586
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,040
- Oh, I don't know how
these smart houses work.

587
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,960
- If you can negotiate trade tariffs

588
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,373
with the Federated States of Micronesia,

589
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,563
you can figure out a Spotify playlist.

590
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:55,166
(storm brewing)

591
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,920
Have you thought about
writing my miniseries?

592
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,045
- It deserves better than me.

593
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:05,280
You know, the money people would never let

594
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,590
a fledgling screenwriter tackle it anyway.

595
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,530
- That's a lame excuse.

596
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,050
Come on. Be honest.

597
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,650
You think my life is superficial.

598
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,910
- What makes you say that?

599
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,150
- Lex told me.

600
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,830
Said you think it's
trivial and beneath you.

601
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,200
- I never said that.

602
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,530
- David, it doesn't seem to be playing.

603
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,431
- Duty calls.

604
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:39,156
(cork popping)

605
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:42,826
(wine pouring)

606
00:32:52,587 --> 00:32:54,740
- You know, we should probably keep away

607
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,907
from this with the MDMA.

608
00:32:56,957 --> 00:33:00,347
- Oh, yeah, it's just
for appearances really.

609
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,170
- I, uh, I had

610
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,730
so many things that I wanted to

611
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,203
talk to you about.

612
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,150
- Well, it's, you know,
there's people here

613
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,823
and there's people coming
over and there's...

614
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,350
- I don't mean to be pushy.

615
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,827
- I know.

616
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:30,920
- You know, I just wish that you'd spent

617
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,593
the entire summer here.

618
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,073
- Yeah, there was no
way. I had obligations.

619
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,353
- [David] What song is this? It's great.

620
00:33:43,403 --> 00:33:45,753
- It's "Slip Away" by Lost Fun.

621
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:51,520
Okay, be honest.

622
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:56,570
I mean, I made a complete
fool out of myself, didn't I?

623
00:33:57,032 --> 00:33:58,449
- No, you didn't.

624
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:00,801
- I don't know.

625
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:02,900
I felt like I was just
desperately trying to impress you

626
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,240
with literary shiny objects.

627
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,483
- Honestly, I...

628
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,153
Honestly, I thought you were so sweet.

629
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,093
You reminded me of Axel,
the guy from Amsterdam.

630
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,420
- Really?

631
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,303
- Yeah.

632
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:26,380
- Well that makes my night.

633
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,510
The MDMA hasn't even kicked in yet,

634
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,000
and that makes my night.

635
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,050
- [David] What year was this album from?

636
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,983
- 1994.

637
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,020
It's just, I felt so stupid
this entire time because,

638
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:48,710
you know, I was very
struck by you, right off.

639
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,980
- [David] I love '90s music.

640
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,173
Is there any Green Day
or No Doubt on here?

641
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,743
- Not on that iPad.

642
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,630
Now I don't want you to
freak out when I say this.

643
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,133
- No.

644
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:05,966
I won't.

645
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:09,277
- But I just think you are incredibly

646
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:12,180
attractive and wonderful.

647
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,143
- Shane, don't.

648
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,283
Please don't.

649
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:23,472
We have to stop this. I can't.

650
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,855
I'm feeling anxious already.

651
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:28,480
(knocking on door)

652
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,507
- [David] Ed and Bev have arrived.

653
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,712
(soft upbeat music)

654
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,880
(door opening)

655
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,713
(thunder cracking)

656
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:45,546
- [Laura] Well, hello, Harry.

657
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:48,323
- That thunder is sounding
foreboding out there.

658
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,180
- We thought it was Ed and
Bev because you knocked.

659
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,713
- Well, formalities die hard at my age.

660
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:55,510
- Can I get you a drink?

661
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,503
- Yeah, Scotch.

662
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,790
- [Lex] Hi, Harry, let me get your jacket.

663
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,680
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

664
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,430
- Ed and Bev must be running late.

665
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,872
I'll be right back.

666
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:12,533
- Look at this. Our old Ouija board.

667
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,650
- That's the analog version.

668
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,260
Download the app, then you can just text

669
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,560
any dead person you want.

670
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,990
- Try and spend some
time with Lex tonight.

671
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,150
Flirt with him. He's
got a big crush on you.

672
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,190
- Oh, I doubt that.

673
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,693
- Just show him some affection.
He could use the ego boost.

674
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,140
Do it as a favor to me.

675
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,830
- It doesn't have to be a favor.

676
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,589
I care about Lex.

677
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:44,353
- Lex, Shane was just telling
me how cute you look tonight.

678
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:46,750
- Oh please.

679
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,764
- Lex already knows that.

680
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:50,147
(phone ringing)

681
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:52,000
- It's Ed. Just a sec.

682
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,883
Yeah.

683
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,340
- Is he bothering you?

684
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,683
- No, I like his energy.

685
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,077
- I didn't know you
liked '90s modern rock.

686
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:06,030
- Well you like System of a Down.

687
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,763
- Yeah, but not to dance to.

688
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:12,140
- Ed and Bev aren't
coming. Bev has a migraine.

689
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,100
- Really? Maybe we can catch
the Warhol film series.

690
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,670
- We'd miss over half of it.

691
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,000
- I wouldn't mind.

692
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,150
- Consider ourselves lucky.

693
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,830
Ed and Bev have become total neurotics

694
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,181
since their Nexium group shut down.

695
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:26,900
(thunder cracking)

696
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,520
- [Laura] You didn't
have to kill the power

697
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,273
to avoid eating my hors-doeuvres.

698
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:38,557
- A.

699
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:42,159
(soft saxophone music)

700
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:43,042
M.

701
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:47,896
Y.

702
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:51,066
(soft saxophone music)

703
00:37:51,116 --> 00:37:51,949
Amy.

704
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:57,189
I don't know anyone named Amy.

705
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,489
(soft saxophone music)

706
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:08,528
Oh, shit. Wait.

707
00:38:10,348 --> 00:38:13,149
There was that Delta
flight attended I hooked up

708
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,784
with about five years ago.

709
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,937
(ice jiggling)

710
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:21,237
(soft saxophone music)

711
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,694
(game piece sliding)

712
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:27,577
Uno.

713
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:30,046
Okay.

714
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:31,897
Okay.

715
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:34,967
Huh, one more try.

716
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:39,318
(soft saxophone music)

717
00:38:41,023 --> 00:38:41,856
Ah.

718
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:44,443
Mm.

719
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:47,743
(soft saxophone music)

720
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:51,984
(game piece sliding)

721
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:53,136
M.

722
00:38:53,186 --> 00:38:56,269
(game piece sliding)

723
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,957
O.

724
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:03,828
(game piece sliding)

725
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:04,711
M.

726
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,113
Oh shit.

727
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:10,165
Mom.

728
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,169
Are you in this room?

729
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,291
Is your ghost in this room?

730
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:22,591
(soft saxophone music)

731
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:26,065
You were so cool to us.

732
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:29,582
And so caring.

733
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:32,725
(soft saxophone music)

734
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:37,095
You just had to go and marry
that sociopath after Dad died.

735
00:39:37,145 --> 00:39:38,813
(soft saxophone music)

736
00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:41,499
(ice jiggling)

737
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:44,799
(soft saxophone music)

738
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:48,428
Was the money that good?

739
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:51,312
(soft saxophone music)

740
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:55,779
Uh, money's no good if you
aren't around to enjoy it.

741
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:02,202
(soft saxophone music)

742
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:06,393
It was confusing.

743
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:09,693
(soft saxophone music)

744
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,008
Was dangerous.

745
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:15,308
(soft saxophone music)

746
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:17,979
Until it ended.

747
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:21,279
(soft saxophone music)

748
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,070
(crickets chirping)

749
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,420
- [Harry] Looks like the
thunder has moved on.

750
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,770
- [Lex] I hope so.

751
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,400
- Taking a psychotropic this evening

752
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,700
was in bad taste, wasn't it?

753
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,530
- You know I'd never judge you.

754
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:45,849
But this.

755
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:50,285
- Yeah (chuckles).

756
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,300
Please don't move away from here.

757
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,603
- I have to.

758
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:59,876
(soft music)

759
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,660
I should never do drugs at parties.

760
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,763
It's so, disorienting.

761
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,700
- How are you gonna drive home?

762
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:14,557
- The same way I always
do. Thinking about you.

763
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:17,024
(soft music)

764
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:21,930
- You know, all this time
we've spent together,

765
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,430
and I've never seen you high.

766
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,943
- No.

767
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,300
Although for a year after my husband died,

768
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,733
I was never sober.

769
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,660
Fortunately, at the tech
company I worked for,

770
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,623
it was hard to tell.

771
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,273
I'm gonna miss you so much.

772
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,530
- I'm gonna miss you too.

773
00:41:47,627 --> 00:41:49,003
But we'll keep in touch.

774
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,530
Email, FaceTime.

775
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,537
- You know what I'm saying.

776
00:41:55,047 --> 00:41:55,943
- Aw, Harry.

777
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,023
- I have to.

778
00:41:58,073 --> 00:42:02,930
I mean, when you got that offer
to sell the house, I just,

779
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:07,700
I hate the idea of not spending those

780
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,893
winter evenings together anymore.

781
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,280
- I told you I was only
here to get better.

782
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,170
It was always temporary.

783
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,803
Never permanent.

784
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,700
- Yes, yes, you were
always clear about that.

785
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,863
- I'm being clear now.

786
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,700
I need you to believe me.

787
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,043
- Of course I believe you.

788
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,130
The age difference.

789
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,350
I know age isn't supposed
to matter anymore, but

790
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,273
is it awkward for you?

791
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,103
- It's not that.

792
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:49,821
(Lex sighing)

793
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,953
I'm in love with Shane.

794
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,690
Isn't that the most stupid thing?

795
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,303
Especially because I don't even think

796
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:04,463
I have a chance with him.

797
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,233
I used to.

798
00:43:09,257 --> 00:43:13,960
And, I'm trying to keep
a positive attitude that,

799
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,279
maybe, it could still work out somehow.

800
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:19,746
(soft music)

801
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,713
Why Shane instead of you?

802
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,233
No reason worthy of you.

803
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,777
- How often I've wanted to touch you,

804
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,180
be intimate with you.

805
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,843
- Please, I can't.

806
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,473
- Especially now that
I've embarrassed us both.

807
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,480
- Don't say that.

808
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,743
You're a good man. You know that.

809
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,244
- Just not, good enough.

810
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,711
(soft music)

811
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:02,390
- I'm gonna make sure you
get home in one piece, okay?

812
00:44:05,531 --> 00:44:08,448
(footsteps fading)

813
00:44:17,398 --> 00:44:20,800
(balls colliding)

814
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,107
- I don't shoot pool
that well in the light,

815
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:27,233
let alone in the dark.

816
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,810
- The clouds have really cleared up.

817
00:44:34,575 --> 00:44:36,063
The moon is so bright.

818
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,493
- It's bright, but not that bright.

819
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,660
- What are you saying, Laura?

820
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,923
- It's obvious Dr.
Feelgood, aka my fiance,

821
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,520
probably prescribed something to

822
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,633
enhance things?

823
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,898
- I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

824
00:45:01,948 --> 00:45:03,615
- No, of course not.

825
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:09,537
Things left unsaid seems to be
the theme for this gathering.

826
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,230
- I wouldn't bet on that.

827
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,880
- I'd be happy to lose
that bet. Believe me.

828
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,763
(soft jazz music)

829
00:45:22,249 --> 00:45:23,273
- So tell me.

830
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,500
Is it true that you worked on the Iran

831
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,855
nuclear deal under Obama?

832
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:30,743
- (smirks) No.

833
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,013
Did David tell you that?

834
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,123
- Yeah.

835
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,280
- Not at all.

836
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,630
I privately briefed Secretary Kerry

837
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,833
on a small, unrelated
project around the same time.

838
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,900
But when he describes me to people,

839
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,943
I am the architect of the JCPA.

840
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,730
- So what branch of the State Department

841
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,903
are you involved with?

842
00:45:58,544 --> 00:45:59,877
- Good question.

843
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:02,313
Depends on the day, I guess.

844
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,970
- I hope you're kidding.

845
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,277
- I wish I was.

846
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,930
Democracy keeps getting heavier to carry.

847
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:15,180
(soft jazz music)

848
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,640
- I can't imagine anything worse

849
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,034
than the collapse of democracy.

850
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:19,990
(soft jazz music)

851
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,330
Except for the A bomb.

852
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,763
- Oh, there's worse.

853
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:31,787
When the people who can
actually do something to save it

854
00:46:31,837 --> 00:46:34,243
decide it's not worth the effort anymore,

855
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:39,300
they just collect and
horde their own resources

856
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,573
and ideas in preparation
for when it all collapses.

857
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,993
Full-on John Bolton stuff.

858
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,673
And I'm not just talking
about the United States.

859
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,383
I'm talking about the world.

860
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,803
Key people. Capable people.

861
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,360
They don't see government
structures are useful.

862
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:10,736
Imagine the Hoover Dam collapsing

863
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,673
and I'm getting paid
to put Band-Aids on it.

864
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,840
- You sure of all that?

865
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,193
When you look out onto that bright moon,

866
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,033
those millions of stars,

867
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,923
and none of it matters,
and it's all just darkness?

868
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,633
- I think it's just as
beautiful as you do.

869
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:42,493
And calming, and inspiring.

870
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,693
Maybe even a symbol of some greater truth.

871
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,440
Something bigger than all of us

872
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,789
that'll keep us functioning
as a human race.

873
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,920
(soft music)

874
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,443
But I can't ignore my
professional perspective.

875
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:06,243
And I can't just magically
think it all away.

876
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,210
My clear and logical mind
sees the world leaders

877
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,460
for who they really are.

878
00:48:14,256 --> 00:48:18,537
An apathetic power elite
preparing to save themselves

879
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,399
while the rest of us consume ourselves.

880
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:26,282
(soft jazz music)

881
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,393
- We shouldn't have this conversation.

882
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,803
I have to sleep alone tonight.

883
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:44,037
- Well that's why I'm with David.

884
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,603
Even with all of his issues,
I'm lucky we found each other.

885
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,543
He's passionate, vital.

886
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,543
And he holds me while I sleep.

887
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:02,370
Keeps me from dreaming
about tariffs, sanctions,

888
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,633
dwindling resources.

889
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:09,860
(Laura sighing)

890
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,500
- Mom, I know this sounds
weird coming from me

891
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,020
since I was never one to talk about my

892
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,633
feelings.

893
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:24,893
Ever.

894
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:29,734
But I, uh

895
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,534
need some advice now.

896
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,150
(David sighing)

897
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,463
My brother hates me.

898
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,780
Your son, he

899
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,450
hates me,

900
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,333
and I

901
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,983
love him.

902
00:49:57,866 --> 00:49:58,699
He's the

903
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,820
only family I have left,

904
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,517
and I want him to be,

905
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:06,938
happy.

906
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:16,495
And

907
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,300
he never got over the shooting.

908
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:25,803
Now I'm a

909
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,233
tough enough nut that
I can file and forget.

910
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,193
Can you make a sign if
you're hearing me, Mom?

911
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:52,330
I want him to forgive me, so if you could

912
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,423
talk to him, that'd be great, yeah.

913
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,170
You two were always so close.

914
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,603
He loved you so much.

915
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:12,343
Make a sign if you're hearing me.

916
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,123
Any sign.

917
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:34,247
- Between the music, the
moonlight and the MDMA,

918
00:51:34,297 --> 00:51:38,223
it feels like we're in
some kind of exotic place.

919
00:51:40,052 --> 00:51:43,004
- Yes, the MDMA is
stronger than I expected.

920
00:51:43,054 --> 00:51:43,887
- Here.

921
00:51:45,222 --> 00:51:46,930
You need to be drinking water.

922
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,026
- Thank you.

923
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:50,493
(soft music)

924
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:58,139
Shane, what are you doing?

925
00:51:58,189 --> 00:51:59,140
- I've wanted to touch your face

926
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:00,590
since the first time we met.

927
00:52:01,508 --> 00:52:03,925
(soft music)

928
00:52:04,961 --> 00:52:07,896
- What do you expect from me?

929
00:52:07,946 --> 00:52:09,098
- Just to listen.

930
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:11,565
(soft music)

931
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:17,351
We're going to be going in
different directions soon,

932
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,160
and I need to tell you...

933
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,043
- Shane.

934
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,738
You have to know that this isn't possible.

935
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,729
Lex is my best friend,
and he's crazy about you.

936
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:33,196
(soft music)

937
00:52:35,482 --> 00:52:37,318
I can't do this to him.

938
00:52:37,368 --> 00:52:39,785
(soft music)

939
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:46,092
Do you know how emotionally
attached he is to you?

940
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:46,975
- Yeah.

941
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:48,827
Of course I do.

942
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:51,294
(soft music)

943
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,980
I already feel guilty for
leading him on. I, I...

944
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,621
I didn't do anything on purpose.

945
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:04,825
(soft music)

946
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:07,573
I just wasn't thinking
about anyone except myself.

947
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,833
- Lex told me about all the
time you spent together.

948
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:15,015
All the

949
00:53:16,317 --> 00:53:17,984
walks and the hikes.

950
00:53:22,343 --> 00:53:25,297
That night at the lake under the stars.

951
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:29,996
He's told me about all that.

952
00:53:30,046 --> 00:53:32,463
(soft music)

953
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,093
- I was very lonely.

954
00:53:38,399 --> 00:53:41,113
I just wanted company after
my relationship ended.

955
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,430
(soft music)

956
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,693
I got insecure about finishing
this screenplay, and Lex,

957
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,763
Lex just kept me from panicking.

958
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,750
- Lex said it was the
best sex he ever had.

959
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,433
Congratulations.

960
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,750
- I didn't realize how vulnerable he was

961
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,223
until it was too late.

962
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:16,840
I know it's all my fault.

963
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:19,307
(soft music)

964
00:54:23,246 --> 00:54:26,646
- Would you have gotten serious
about Lex if we hadn't met?

965
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:29,113
(soft music)

966
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:38,356
- I don't know.

967
00:54:42,827 --> 00:54:43,610
Maybe.

968
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,597
(soft music)

969
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:50,367
When you feel empty inside,
anything is possible.

970
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:52,834
(soft music)

971
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:58,006
- Look, I'm married.

972
00:55:00,525 --> 00:55:02,444
I'm trying to adopt a kid.

973
00:55:02,494 --> 00:55:05,363
(soft music)

974
00:55:05,413 --> 00:55:07,140
I have a life.

975
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:10,953
- I know, but is it the life you want?

976
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,453
I'm serious. You've been
flirting with me for weeks.

977
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,353
- Don't.

978
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,193
My husband is a good man.

979
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,773
He was a little suspicious as to why

980
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:34,646
I would wanna spend the
summer apart from him.

981
00:55:34,696 --> 00:55:36,260
I don't think he bought the whole

982
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,093
Lex needs his best
friend's support excuse.

983
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,980
He's a software engineer

984
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:49,250
who thinks he can just solve every issue

985
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,503
by writing an algorithm.

986
00:55:53,212 --> 00:55:54,660
(bird calling)

987
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:58,110
I keep my inner

988
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,020
source code behind a lotta firewalls

989
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,260
because if he saw what was written

990
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:09,953
what was programmed,

991
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,900
he'd be very critical.

992
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,340
He'd be very hurt.

993
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,860
I've just been going through
the motions of living,

994
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:30,020
and I don't know when that happened.

995
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:30,903
- Kenny.

996
00:56:35,718 --> 00:56:37,385
- I want to respond.

997
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,680
You're saying all the right things,

998
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,487
but I need to just, run.

999
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,570
- No, don't run.

1000
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,533
- I have to run. It's all I can do.

1001
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,430
I knew you were into me. Of course I did.

1002
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,390
That's why I avoided being alone with you

1003
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,710
because I felt so guilty.

1004
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,903
- Let me kiss you.

1005
00:56:56,953 --> 00:56:57,786
- I can't.

1006
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,893
We can't.

1007
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,823
Because it'll be a ticking
bomb waiting to go off.

1008
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,180
There's just no way.

1009
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:16,685
(soft piano music)

1010
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:34,731
- [Shane] Well, it's
time for me to pass out.

1011
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,750
I'm sorry about the Warhol films.

1012
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:42,620
- I'd pour you some lukewarm
coffee if I thought it'd help.

1013
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:48,600
- It wouldn't, and I'd rather stay

1014
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:52,582
altered.

1015
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:55,465
(soft jazz music)

1016
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:01,133
Yeah, on second thought, I'll
take that lukewarm coffee.

1017
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,833
Man, I have to work tomorrow.

1018
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:11,905
- You've been in a weird mood tonight.

1019
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,788
(soft jazz music)

1020
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,813
- Did you know that there's
an apathetic power elite,

1021
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,583
preparing to save themselves,

1022
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,463
while we consume ourselves?

1023
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:33,203
(soft jazz music)

1024
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:42,993
- Shane.

1025
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,483
What happened to us?

1026
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:48,713
- What do you mean?

1027
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:50,883
- You know,

1028
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,763
we were getting so close.

1029
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:59,963
All that time we spent
together. The night at the lake.

1030
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:04,125
Did I read too much into all that?

1031
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:07,008
(soft jazz music)

1032
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,583
- You might have.

1033
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,323
I just can't get involved right now.

1034
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:22,793
And I'm still rebounding
from my last relationship.

1035
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,477
My life and my work are still a mess.

1036
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:30,563
And I'm hardly a catch right now.

1037
00:59:32,795 --> 00:59:33,933
- How, how can I help?

1038
00:59:36,347 --> 00:59:38,150
- Lex, these are my problems.

1039
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,930
I don't wanna go dragging you into them.

1040
00:59:41,952 --> 00:59:44,830
You got it so good right now.

1041
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,143
It's time you start creating your future.

1042
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,520
- I know. I know.

1043
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:52,403
You're right.

1044
00:59:54,696 --> 00:59:58,583
It's just, I've been having these dreams

1045
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,603
that when we're both in
LA, that we could...

1046
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,043
We see things the same
way on so many subjects.

1047
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,163
That's rare and special, and...

1048
01:00:13,979 --> 01:00:15,480
(Lex sighing)

1049
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,363
I'm sorry.

1050
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,993
I'm exhausted.

1051
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,203
Don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

1052
01:00:24,438 --> 01:00:25,355
- You know,

1053
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,663
the funny thing is,

1054
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:32,440
I'm probably gonna up end
calling you at 3:00 AM

1055
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:35,060
from Mulholland Drive so
that you can talk me down

1056
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:37,937
from jumping off the Hollywood sign.

1057
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:46,402
(lights buzzing)

1058
01:01:04,347 --> 01:01:07,097
(David groaning)

1059
01:01:09,902 --> 01:01:12,569
(David sighing)

1060
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,143
- [Laura] Going to be able to sleep?

1061
01:01:17,859 --> 01:01:20,393
- Oh yeah. Been here before.

1062
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:26,097
- You know you can be
honest with me, right?

1063
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,627
- Where did that come from?

1064
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,810
- If we're going to be married,

1065
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,197
we should be able to
tell each other things.

1066
01:01:38,325 --> 01:01:39,773
- Of course.

1067
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,090
Why would you think otherwise?

1068
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,683
- I already live with too
much deception at my job.

1069
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:58,863
I won't have it in my marriage.

1070
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,820
- I told you all about the shooting.

1071
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:06,703
- Yeah?

1072
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,770
- I don't like that tone.

1073
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,173
- Everything you've told me,

1074
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:17,273
I could have read in the press coverage.

1075
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:23,173
- There was nothing more to tell.

1076
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:29,910
- The studio developing the miniseries

1077
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,753
seems to think otherwise.

1078
01:02:36,947 --> 01:02:39,697
(David scoffing)

1079
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,387
- Hey, can I give you
a hand with anything?

1080
01:02:48,437 --> 01:02:49,363
- No, I'm good.

1081
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,743
So, I had a talk with Shane.

1082
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,303
And he doesn't want a
relationship right now,

1083
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,783
which is totally understandable.

1084
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,640
He's got a lotta issues to work out,

1085
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,023
like most of us, I guess.

1086
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,663
But, maybe things can be
different down the road, you know?

1087
01:03:14,717 --> 01:03:16,803
I'm just happy things
are out in the open now.

1088
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,697
I do feel better.

1089
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:22,890
We'll both be in LA.

1090
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,260
Anything could happen, right?

1091
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:30,463
(soft music)

1092
01:03:30,513 --> 01:03:31,864
(phone buzzing)

1093
01:03:31,914 --> 01:03:34,000
What the hell is that?

1094
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:36,717
(phone buzzing)

1095
01:03:40,823 --> 01:03:43,091
(phone buzzing)

1096
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:45,558
(soft music)

1097
01:03:55,151 --> 01:03:57,818
(phone pinging)

1098
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:02,654
(vehicle passing)

1099
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:04,843
- I just told you.

1100
01:04:04,893 --> 01:04:05,676
The power was out, the WiFi was out,

1101
01:04:05,726 --> 01:04:07,213
and there's no reception up here.

1102
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:10,863
I know.

1103
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,816
(soft jazz music)

1104
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:15,380
I'm not sure.

1105
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:19,303
I might go to LA and
help Lex get organized.

1106
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,960
I can't talk about that right now.

1107
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:28,362
Okay, it's late and I'm tired and...

1108
01:04:28,412 --> 01:04:31,632
(soft jazz music)

1109
01:04:31,682 --> 01:04:33,132
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1110
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:36,849
(soft jazz music)

1111
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,090
Get some sleep.

1112
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,973
(soft jazz music)

1113
01:04:47,377 --> 01:04:48,160
Good night.

1114
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:51,043
(soft jazz music)

1115
01:04:53,017 --> 01:04:54,910
(gasps) Jesus, you scared me.

1116
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,410
- [Shane] I heard your voice.

1117
01:04:57,696 --> 01:05:00,529
(soft jazz music)

1118
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,453
- Shane, people are still awake.

1119
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,663
- Kenny, I'm in love with you.

1120
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:26,533
I have been since that first day.

1121
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:27,420
- Shane.

1122
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,270
- We could be alone, you know.

1123
01:05:31,102 --> 01:05:35,188
- We can't spend the
night in the guesthouse.

1124
01:05:35,238 --> 01:05:38,571
- It doesn't have to be the whole night.

1125
01:05:39,887 --> 01:05:42,273
But we can share some of it together.

1126
01:05:43,228 --> 01:05:46,061
(soft jazz music)

1127
01:05:47,061 --> 01:05:49,728
- If this means anything to you,

1128
01:05:50,748 --> 01:05:53,334
I really want to, but...

1129
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:56,217
(soft jazz music)

1130
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:09,658
(footsteps approaching)

1131
01:06:16,761 --> 01:06:19,594
(soft jazz music)

1132
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,794
(light upbeat music)

1133
01:06:40,844 --> 01:06:43,060
- All right, so taking a
look at the roof, looks good.

1134
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:45,510
Should hold up for at
least another 15 years.

1135
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,013
- So the roof passed?

1136
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,110
- Home inspections
aren't a pass or a fail.

1137
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,070
You know, my job here is
to find structural defects,

1138
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,870
identify any potential safety
issues, that kinda thing.

1139
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:59,390
When did you get the offer on the place?

1140
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,070
- Oh, uh, I don't have
an official offer yet,

1141
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,798
but I have someone interested,
so I'm just trying to...

1142
01:07:05,848 --> 01:07:07,480
- Get in front of any issues, yeah.

1143
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,313
- Right.

1144
01:07:08,363 --> 01:07:11,183
- No, that's smart. You want
the purchase to go smoothly.

1145
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,430
- Yeah, I just really
need it to go through,

1146
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,920
so thank you for fitting
me in on short notice.

1147
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:20,080
- Sure, sure, no problem.

1148
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:23,590
Um, taking a look at
the foundation as well,

1149
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,260
and you're good on the termites,

1150
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,660
meaning you don't have any.

1151
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:30,853
Is David Frazier your brother?

1152
01:07:32,145 --> 01:07:33,320
- Yes.

1153
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:36,399
- Yeah, he was really good
in that television show.

1154
01:07:36,449 --> 01:07:38,840
(faucet running)

1155
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,960
Okay, so I still need to check out

1156
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:43,280
the master bedroom and bathroom.

1157
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:46,460
- Oh, well, my brother's
still sleeping in there.

1158
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:47,410
- Really?

1159
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,450
- Yeah, he can be a bit of a late sleeper,

1160
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,420
but he should be up soon.

1161
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,773
- All right, um.

1162
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,230
I could check out the guesthouse,

1163
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,340
make sure that's up to code.

1164
01:07:57,390 --> 01:07:58,577
- Let's hope.
- Yeah.

1165
01:07:58,627 --> 01:07:59,940
- You saw it when you came in?

1166
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:01,800
- Yeah, yeah, I'll just
make my way over there

1167
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:02,953
if that's all right?

1168
01:08:03,003 --> 01:08:04,339
- Yeah, sure. I'll follow you in a minute.

1169
01:08:04,389 --> 01:08:07,389
(light piano music)

1170
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,380
- Hey, how's the inspection going?

1171
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:15,720
- Good so far. No issues yet.

1172
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:18,220
- [Kenny] That's great.
Did you get Harry's text?

1173
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,823
- No, I left my phone in my room.

1174
01:08:22,133 --> 01:08:23,140
- He said that stand that sells

1175
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,773
those avocados you like opened up again.

1176
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,343
I told him to bring some over.

1177
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:32,207
- Okay.

1178
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,263
- What's wrong? You seem depressed.

1179
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:39,373
- Shane. I just think
about him constantly.

1180
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:43,433
- Lex, just don't. It's
not healthy for you.

1181
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,084
- Think he's gonna write
that miniseries for David.

1182
01:08:48,134 --> 01:08:48,967
- Oh God.

1183
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:52,910
- They're all supposed to go
out for lunch again today.

1184
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,450
If he ever gets up.

1185
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,323
- He's up, shaking off last night.

1186
01:08:57,505 --> 01:09:00,505
(light piano music)

1187
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:03,543
- Lex.

1188
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:05,503
- Yes.

1189
01:09:06,593 --> 01:09:08,843
- I did find some issues
with the guesthouse.

1190
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:10,970
- What kind of issues?

1191
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:14,370
- Well, there are clearly
some code violations

1192
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,140
that would need to be disclosed,

1193
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,040
unless they were brought up to specs.

1194
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,120
- How much is that gonna cost?

1195
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,300
- Why don't you come outside with me,

1196
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,903
and I'll walk you through
what needs to be done?

1197
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,633
- Okay.

1198
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:31,245
(faucet running)

1199
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,320
- [Shane] Good morning.

1200
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,340
- Hi. David's running a
little late from last night.

1201
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,110
I'll let him know you're here.

1202
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,460
- Why are you avoiding me?

1203
01:09:42,339 --> 01:09:43,122
- I'm not.

1204
01:09:43,172 --> 01:09:44,460
- No?

1205
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,040
Because you're acting
like the straight friend

1206
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,200
from high school who's regretting

1207
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,800
what happened the night before.

1208
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,970
- I think you need to just
leave and go back to LA.

1209
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,333
- No, not before you
tell me what's going on.

1210
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,680
- I'm having a really hard time.

1211
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,740
So is Lex, even though
he's trying to hide it.

1212
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:01,843
- Don't tell me that.

1213
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,660
- He can't stop thinking about you.

1214
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:06,543
- And you?

1215
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,060
- Of course I think about you.

1216
01:10:11,264 --> 01:10:12,763
- But you still avoid me.

1217
01:10:14,484 --> 01:10:17,220
- Are you really gonna
write David's miniseries?

1218
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,390
- Honestly? I'm seriously
thinking about it.

1219
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,820
- Why? What happened to the
screenplay about your father?

1220
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:24,383
- Well, I...

1221
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:26,920
It just isn't coming through.

1222
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:31,450
I've told you how exhausting it's been

1223
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,593
trying to make it happen
this summer, and I d...

1224
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,093
Whatever.

1225
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:38,993
It's lifeless.

1226
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,360
You know, David, he tells
me all these stories,

1227
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:45,723
and he's got actual interest
from real producers.

1228
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:49,250
You know, it's a powerful story.

1229
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,950
The shooting alone is a movie.

1230
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,420
- But Lex doesn't want it written.

1231
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:59,010
- Kenny, someone is going to write it.

1232
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,630
You know that.

1233
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,163
If it's me, then I can protect him.

1234
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,900
- Shane, my God, just put
yourself in Lex's place for once.

1235
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:12,440
Here's this 14-year-old
boy desperately struggling

1236
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:15,590
with his sexuality, with a
sociopath of a stepfather

1237
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,260
who constantly beats up his mom,

1238
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:19,020
who turns to beating up David and him

1239
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,970
until the fateful night
that Lex shoots him.

1240
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,210
It completed wrecked his life,

1241
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,320
and you wanna put him
through it all again.

1242
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:27,510
All the people staring and the horrible

1243
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,310
social media memes and hashtags.

1244
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,983
- You're naive if you
think Lex can avoid that.

1245
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,753
- I don't...

1246
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,900
I'm sorry, I just,

1247
01:11:38,505 --> 01:11:42,163
I'm confused, and I feel guilty and...

1248
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:44,823
Took Lex.

1249
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:49,047
(light jazz music)

1250
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:02,523
Shane.

1251
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,634
Please don't.

1252
01:12:06,684 --> 01:12:09,601
(light jazz music)

1253
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,003
- Let's go to Amsterdam together.

1254
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,374
- Go to Amsterdam together?

1255
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,323
Jesus, you really are a screenwriter.

1256
01:12:25,482 --> 01:12:27,433
This is why you're so dangerous to me.

1257
01:12:27,483 --> 01:12:30,068
You just make my head spin.

1258
01:12:30,118 --> 01:12:33,035
(light jazz music)

1259
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,690
Shane, I can't, I can't do this.

1260
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:42,520
(soft jazz music)

1261
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:51,833
(both breathing hard)

1262
01:12:58,157 --> 01:12:59,920
(soft jazz music)

1263
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,083
- [Lex] And there's a
circuit breaker in here.

1264
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,840
- [Kenny] Oh my God.

1265
01:13:10,309 --> 01:13:13,476
(door sliding slowly)

1266
01:13:15,914 --> 01:13:18,747
(soft jazz music)

1267
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:23,080
- [Inspector] I can check
that circuit breaker later.

1268
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:25,203
I'm not really too worried about it.

1269
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,980
Did you say the pool is gas-powered

1270
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,063
and not connected to solar panels?

1271
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:33,683
Lex?

1272
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,003
- Yeah, the gas powers it.

1273
01:13:38,189 --> 01:13:39,930
- [Inspector] That's
still probably really low

1274
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,043
on the electric bill, I'd think.

1275
01:13:42,093 --> 01:13:43,176
Uh. Hey, Lex.

1276
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,780
- Yeah, the solar panels keep
the electric bills really low

1277
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:50,433
for a house this size.

1278
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:54,800
- [Inspector] Um, is
it okay if we check out

1279
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,033
the master bedroom now?

1280
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,420
(Lex sighing)

1281
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:02,040
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm
getting a bad headache.

1282
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,770
Can I meet you there in a minute?

1283
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,463
- [Inspector] Sure, no problem.

1284
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,230
I'll have some more
questions for you, though.

1285
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,353
- Sure. Sure.

1286
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:13,958
(soft music)

1287
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,820
- Fuck, I can't believe
that just happened.

1288
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:22,993
- It was my fault.

1289
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,097
- Oh my God.

1290
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,040
Lex, Lex, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1291
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:34,121
- Has this been going on the whole time?

1292
01:14:34,171 --> 01:14:36,303
- No, no. Jesus, no.

1293
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,940
- Are you in love with him?

1294
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:41,313
- It's not what it looks like.

1295
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,433
- What does that mean?

1296
01:14:49,008 --> 01:14:50,203
- I don't, I don't...

1297
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:54,373
I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not sure.

1298
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:58,340
- [Lex] A lot of things
are making sense now.

1299
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:00,280
- Lex, I swear, there's
nothing to make sense of.

1300
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,190
Absolutely nothing.

1301
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,690
- [Lex] All those times
I saw you and Shane

1302
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,448
checking each other out.

1303
01:15:05,498 --> 01:15:08,490
- Don't do that. Just don't do that.

1304
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:11,450
- Lex, this is all my fault.
Okay, don't blame Kenny.

1305
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,283
- [Kenny] Shane, leave us alone.

1306
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,960
- I just, I hate that
you found out like this.

1307
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,380
- [Kenny] There's nothing to find out.

1308
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:18,090
You're making things worse.

1309
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,540
- Okay, well there's not nothing.

1310
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,510
There's everything that's happened.

1311
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,960
I mean, we might as well
get it out in the open.

1312
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:28,370
Lex, I want Kenny to come with me to LA,

1313
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,900
or Amsterdam, or wherever he wants to go.

1314
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:34,390
- Shane, the summer is over.

1315
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,470
I'm going back to my life in Seattle.

1316
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,110
I can't play these games.

1317
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,673
Maybe 10 years ago I could, but I...

1318
01:15:43,645 --> 01:15:45,813
I don't, I don't know who I am anymore.

1319
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,957
Clearly not the person I thought I was.

1320
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:54,823
- I'm thinking that wine
tasting is going to be packed.

1321
01:15:54,873 --> 01:15:56,607
- [Laura] Oh, David's wimping
out on going to Rutherford's.

1322
01:15:56,657 --> 01:15:59,980
- I'm not. I'm just saying
today might not be the best day.

1323
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:01,760
- We can go tomorrow instead.

1324
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:04,364
You and Shane can work on
the miniseries around here.

1325
01:16:04,414 --> 01:16:06,600
- You know, Shane, I was thinking.

1326
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:08,870
We could do a whole section on Las Vegas.

1327
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,700
What happened in Vegas
doesn't need to stay in Vegas.

1328
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,680
- Did you tell Lex about our plans?

1329
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:14,800
- Oh that's right.

1330
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:19,220
Lex, Laura and I decided that

1331
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:22,650
we're going to live here.

1332
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,050
This house is just perfect for us.

1333
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,190
- I was hooked the
moment I stepped inside.

1334
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,590
Felt like home to me.

1335
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,940
- I know you're moving back to LA,

1336
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:33,920
but whenever you wanna use
it, consider it your home too.

1337
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:37,310
Weekends, summertime, whenever.

1338
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,630
And don't feel modest about
bringing someone with you.

1339
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,530
We're all adults.

1340
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:42,390
- [Laura] Are you bringing a jacket?

1341
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,413
- [David] Uh, no.

1342
01:16:44,463 --> 01:16:45,900
- I don't understand.

1343
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,220
- I'm thinking one of my first projects

1344
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,930
will be to retile the pool.

1345
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,030
Something

1346
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:54,810
Greek, like at Caesar's Palace.

1347
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,210
- [Laura] I love that pool.

1348
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,610
- What are you talking about?

1349
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:04,223
- Uh, we're going to move back here.

1350
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,060
Laura and I discussed it, and we're

1351
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,860
moving in permanently.

1352
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,180
Laura loves Northern California,

1353
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,553
and I have always loved this house.

1354
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,223
It...

1355
01:17:16,273 --> 01:17:17,960
- [Lex] You can't move back here.

1356
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:18,843
- Why not?

1357
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:21,660
- Because I'm going to sell this place.

1358
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,240
- You're selling it?

1359
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,810
- I told you.

1360
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:27,693
- Since when?

1361
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,910
- I've told you three times at least.

1362
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,540
- You have?

1363
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,580
- Don't you ever listen to me?

1364
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,991
Do you only care about
what you have to say?

1365
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:39,920
- Whoa. Why are you getting so freak-out?

1366
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:43,440
- I have a house
inspector here, right now.

1367
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:44,920
He's going over everything to make sure

1368
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,690
it can be ready to go on the market.

1369
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,523
- So?

1370
01:17:47,573 --> 01:17:49,560
Wherever he is, find him and tell him

1371
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:51,130
his services aren't needed.

1372
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,060
I'll pay for him coming
out here. Don't worry.

1373
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:53,990
- What?

1374
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,140
- You can't sell it. This
is gonna be our home.

1375
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:59,120
- [Lex] You can't be telling me this now.

1376
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:02,200
- Lex, think. This is the family house.

1377
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,180
How can you sell it?

1378
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:06,090
Do you even know how to sell a house?

1379
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,990
Hell, do you know if you even own it?

1380
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:10,330
- Who do you think owns it?

1381
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:13,340
- I do. Well, we do, you and me.

1382
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,770
Mom bought it, and the trust transferred

1383
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:15,983
it to us when she died.

1384
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:19,860
- Which is when you gave it me.

1385
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:20,837
I said then I'd probably sell it

1386
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:22,720
and we could split the money.

1387
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,733
You said fine, you could use the cash.

1388
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:27,953
- I was probably high when I said that.

1389
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,930
- You said it was mine.

1390
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,510
- Yeah, to live in, not to sell.

1391
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,726
- To live in? What does
that mean, like a caretaker?

1392
01:18:39,776 --> 01:18:43,900
- (sighs) Said too much
without thinking it through.

1393
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:46,493
Being practical has never
been my strong suit.

1394
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,270
- I can't afford to move
without selling this place.

1395
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,580
Being sick put me in debt.

1396
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:54,983
- No one is throwing you
out in the street, Lex.

1397
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:57,860
- I'm counting on this money.

1398
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:00,030
I haven't worked in two years.

1399
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,020
I spent my savings. I took out loans.

1400
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:07,810
- Well, sometimes things
change. It's as simple as that.

1401
01:19:10,237 --> 01:19:11,810
- What?

1402
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,707
- Laura and I are getting married,

1403
01:19:13,757 --> 01:19:15,760
and we want to get settled.

1404
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:17,490
Mom acted in a lot of junk movies

1405
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,150
to be able to afford this place.

1406
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,660
She'd have wanted it
to stay in the family.

1407
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:23,260
- We should discuss this later.

1408
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:27,790
- You are such a fucking phony!

1409
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,890
I kept the house going since she died!

1410
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:30,850
- Lex.

1411
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,143
- Why didn't you just stay away?

1412
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:39,130
- Laura and I are getting married.

1413
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,000
We want to start a family.

1414
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:41,890
Who knows?

1415
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:45,370
Maybe we'll hate living here
and in a year we'll move.

1416
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,410
- My life isn't worth all this trouble.

1417
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,040
- Everyone just stop this.

1418
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,490
David, you know how much
Lex has been through.

1419
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:54,010
- He doesn't give a shit
about what he says to me.

1420
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,460
Just blames me for everything.

1421
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:58,370
- You are to blame.

1422
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,300
- Everyone calm down.

1423
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,240
- I'm perfectly calm, Laura. Shit happens.

1424
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:06,810
Life isn't fair, and if
your life didn't turn out

1425
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:10,333
the way you wanted, stop accusing me.

1426
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,360
- At least I didn't pull the trigger.

1427
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:20,430
But I sure as hell said
what the lawyers told me to.

1428
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:22,463
Right, David?

1429
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:25,743
- That's, uh,

1430
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,153
t-total bullshit.

1431
01:20:31,067 --> 01:20:33,333
- It's not bullshit. It's the truth.

1432
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:38,553
I saw what he did to you,
what you let him do to you.

1433
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:40,897
- You goddam faggot.

1434
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:45,950
- I woulda been there for you.

1435
01:20:46,897 --> 01:20:48,013
It was self-defense.

1436
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,570
But you had the future. You had a career.

1437
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,500
- This is totally inappropriate.

1438
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:58,183
- And I'm just wrecked.

1439
01:20:59,747 --> 01:21:02,060
And you just go through
the days with no guilt!

1440
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:03,430
- Everyone, please.

1441
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,630
- It's his excuse for wasting his life.

1442
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,690
Throwing it away to hurt my career.

1443
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:09,030
- That's not true.

1444
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,340
- Yes, it's hatred, pure hatred!

1445
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:13,900
- Maybe things coulda
been different for me

1446
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,850
if I wasn't forced to go through that!

1447
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,663
- All right, if you could just show me

1448
01:21:17,713 --> 01:21:18,950
how to get to the attic.

1449
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,833
- Get out!

1450
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:21,493
- Excuse me.

1451
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:22,650
- Get outta here! Just leave!

1452
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,930
- David, calm down.

1453
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,580
Fine, take the house.

1454
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:28,120
I had no idea it meant that much to you.

1455
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,210
- Okay, that's enough.

1456
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,600
- I said he could have the house,

1457
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:31,889
so let's get packed and get outta here.

1458
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:33,080
- That's enough!

1459
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,260
- Maybe there are some
things I'd do differently

1460
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:38,433
if I had them to do
over again, but I can't.

1461
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:45,282
(footsteps fading)

1462
01:21:46,236 --> 01:21:49,006
(door slamming)

1463
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:51,723
(David sighing)

1464
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:59,263
Sorry for all the drama.

1465
01:22:02,481 --> 01:22:03,663
The past is the past.

1466
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:06,983
No changing it.

1467
01:22:19,793 --> 01:22:23,110
(knocking on door)

1468
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:23,993
- Lex?

1469
01:22:31,394 --> 01:22:34,163
Can I have my Xanax pills back?

1470
01:22:34,213 --> 01:22:35,930
- I don't know where they are.

1471
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,720
- They're not in my nightstand.

1472
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:38,980
- Who cares?

1473
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,340
- I care. You know this.

1474
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:42,233
Don't be stupid, who cares?

1475
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:44,773
Where are they?

1476
01:22:45,944 --> 01:22:47,660
(drawers sliding and closing)

1477
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,520
- I have no reason to get up tomorrow.

1478
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:51,882
- Then you need to make up a reason.

1479
01:22:51,932 --> 01:22:54,551
What about, what happened
to LA, getting an agent,

1480
01:22:54,601 --> 01:22:56,753
doing voice-over work?

1481
01:22:56,803 --> 01:22:57,853
You're so damn angry.

1482
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:02,033
- If I haven't made it as an
actor by now, why would I?

1483
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:05,462
- I don't know. You'll have
to try harder, I guess.

1484
01:23:05,512 --> 01:23:08,760
(drawers sliding and closing)

1485
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:11,953
- So, you and Shane are a thing now?

1486
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:15,530
- We just became physically
attracted to each other.

1487
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,413
It happens.

1488
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,470
- But you knew how much I was into him.

1489
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:24,280
- I didn't instigate it, I
mean, my God, we're all isolated

1490
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:26,653
from the world up here,
weird things can happen.

1491
01:23:40,836 --> 01:23:41,836
The truth is

1492
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:46,503
I did flirt with Shane.

1493
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,650
I wanted him to think I was

1494
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:53,283
sexy.

1495
01:23:55,249 --> 01:23:57,383
I didn't expect it to go anywhere.

1496
01:23:57,433 --> 01:24:00,650
I just needed to feel wanted and

1497
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:04,103
Shane was a challenge.

1498
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,113
Smart.

1499
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:08,293
Charismatic.

1500
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,490
Busy with his screenplay.

1501
01:24:14,881 --> 01:24:15,873
Outta my league.

1502
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:19,323
And,

1503
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:26,260
slowly I realized how
vulnerable and uncertain

1504
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:27,903
he is about so many things.

1505
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:34,263
I fantasized about him.

1506
01:24:36,951 --> 01:24:40,200
I even started dreaming
about him, and then it just

1507
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,603
spiraled outta control.

1508
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:47,613
- So, what are you gonna
do, go away with him?

1509
01:24:51,195 --> 01:24:53,530
- I can't. There's no way.

1510
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,583
I'm married and adopting a kid.

1511
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,650
- That's something I wouldn't know.

1512
01:25:01,267 --> 01:25:02,463
- Give me those pills.

1513
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,063
Tomorrow will come, and
you'll find some distractions.

1514
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:11,633
You'll sell this place.
You'll move back to LA.

1515
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:17,510
Get some work. Fall in love.

1516
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:22,353
Maybe it'll be great, and maybe it won't.

1517
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:25,786
But there's so many
things to keep you going.

1518
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:27,680
Things that

1519
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:31,230
at times seem petty and annoying

1520
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,900
but are crucial to keep
you from focusing on...

1521
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:34,783
- The truth?

1522
01:25:36,697 --> 01:25:41,697
- The truth. I don't know
what the truth is, do you?

1523
01:25:44,003 --> 01:25:45,853
- I just wanna swallow all the Xanax.

1524
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:48,680
- You'll need a lot more
than what I brought with me,

1525
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:50,530
like 10 times more.

1526
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,970
- I'll still take it all.

1527
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,020
- Stop it.

1528
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:54,970
You're behaving like
one of those characters

1529
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,998
from a Ryan Murphy show
that you hate so much.

1530
01:25:58,048 --> 01:25:58,831
If you really wanted to die,

1531
01:25:58,881 --> 01:26:00,627
you would have done it eight months ago.

1532
01:26:03,887 --> 01:26:07,220
- I'm so lonely (sobs).

1533
01:26:09,741 --> 01:26:10,741
- It's okay.

1534
01:26:11,576 --> 01:26:16,543
You know, you need to stop
and give me those pills.

1535
01:26:17,999 --> 01:26:20,582
(Lex exhaling)

1536
01:26:25,945 --> 01:26:26,862
Look at me.

1537
01:26:28,782 --> 01:26:29,699
I know you.

1538
01:26:32,266 --> 01:26:35,183
You don't really wanna die, do you?

1539
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,533
- No.

1540
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:40,150
That's the problem.

1541
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,100
I've always wanted to live.

1542
01:26:45,494 --> 01:26:48,077
(Lex exhaling)

1543
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:52,550
- Where is everybody?

1544
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,100
The going gets a little rough,

1545
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:56,000
and everyone vanishes into the woodwork.

1546
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:58,273
Lex? We're heading out.

1547
01:26:59,973 --> 01:27:01,950
Oh, I hate these pants.

1548
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,110
Look like I should be
working at a gas station.

1549
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,613
- You look fine.

1550
01:27:10,262 --> 01:27:11,950
(David sighing)

1551
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,850
- You know, I'm

1552
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,233
really gonna miss the place.

1553
01:27:18,057 --> 01:27:19,720
Forgot how pretty it was up here.

1554
01:27:22,077 --> 01:27:22,977
Nice and tranquil.

1555
01:27:25,863 --> 01:27:27,923
Been in our family for a long time.

1556
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,473
Closest thing to

1557
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,570
roots for me.

1558
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,453
- Mm-hm.

1559
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,940
- Woulda been nice.

1560
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,536
God, I sound like my
grandfather or something.

1561
01:27:44,586 --> 01:27:46,260
(Laura chuckling)

1562
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:49,680
Oh well. Wasn't meant to be.

1563
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:52,050
- Border ranch will be fine.

1564
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,110
I could live in a storage container,

1565
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:55,880
as long as we're together.

1566
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:59,732
- Careful. By marrying
me, it might come to that.

1567
01:27:59,782 --> 01:28:01,720
(both laughing)

1568
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:04,450
Lex, we're heading back to SoCal.

1569
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,721
If you need anything, we're
staying at the Brookshires.

1570
01:28:07,771 --> 01:28:11,320
Let's not dwell on what happened earlier.

1571
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:12,850
It's in the past.

1572
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,633
Life's too short to
just focus on tragedies.

1573
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,930
I know we all said things we're sorry for.

1574
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:25,750
We're all, complicated.

1575
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,000
Otherwise we wouldn't
all be so interesting.

1576
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,680
Seriously, though,

1577
01:28:33,694 --> 01:28:35,194
I'm sorry if I hurt you, okay?

1578
01:28:36,664 --> 01:28:37,814
I just wasn't thinking.

1579
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:43,652
- Like you said, it's
over now. In the past.

1580
01:28:43,702 --> 01:28:46,830
(birds singing)

1581
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,480
- Hey, uh, I called that
housing inspector back,

1582
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:53,050
smoothed things over.

1583
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,680
Scheduled your appointment for tomorrow.

1584
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:56,563
- Thanks.

1585
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:02,540
- Kenny, this is for you.
Saw you checking it out.

1586
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:05,150
It's yours now. I'd love you to have it.

1587
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:06,993
- Thank you.

1588
01:29:07,043 --> 01:29:08,720
- Can I help with the bags?

1589
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:09,590
- There's Harry.

1590
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,927
Perfect timing to help with
the bags and say goodbye.

1591
01:29:12,977 --> 01:29:15,730
- [Laura] I'll unlock the car.

1592
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,510
- Uh, let them get that.

1593
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,253
So remember, we're going to be
staying with the Brookshires.

1594
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:25,060
I'll call you when I have an official

1595
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,683
wedding date locked in, okay?

1596
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:30,050
It would mean everything
to me for you to be there

1597
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:32,050
as my best man, tell me you'll do that.

1598
01:29:33,227 --> 01:29:34,127
- You know I will.

1599
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,300
- If you need anything,
just text me, okay?

1600
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:40,663
And tell Shane I need to
rethink the miniseries.

1601
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,470
If I hear back from the studios

1602
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:45,388
with a fresh approach, then I'll call him.

1603
01:29:45,438 --> 01:29:47,521
Love you, Little Brother.

1604
01:29:49,874 --> 01:29:50,724
- I love you too.

1605
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:56,164
- Harry, you left two.

1606
01:29:56,214 --> 01:29:59,580
(birds singing)

1607
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:02,490
- You aren't even gone yet,
and I feel like I've lost

1608
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,640
something that'll never come my way again.

1609
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:09,010
I just keep failing at everything
that's important to me.

1610
01:30:13,428 --> 01:30:14,983
- Time will pass.

1611
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,940
You'll move on from this summer.

1612
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:20,443
- And you?

1613
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:26,073
Will you simply move on?

1614
01:30:32,406 --> 01:30:35,603
- (sighs) Now he flies away
as if nothing had happened.

1615
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:39,963
- I really should be going too.

1616
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:43,263
- House inspections.

1617
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:45,503
Open houses.

1618
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,540
All these little details.

1619
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,123
- Lex, I wish I could
tell you not to worry.

1620
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:53,160
- Harry.

1621
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:55,500
- That I'd take care
of you and that nothing

1622
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:56,843
would make me happier.

1623
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,293
You've become a part of my
life, and a treasured part.

1624
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,760
You're the only thing that
gives it meaning anymore.

1625
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,733
- Harry, don't.

1626
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,400
- I know that when you leave here,

1627
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:14,163
we'll never see each other again.

1628
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:19,553
But believe me, I really
did grow to love you.

1629
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:22,073
Unconditionally.

1630
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:24,133
- Lex?

1631
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,080
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1632
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:35,300
I, I think it's better for everyone

1633
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:36,983
if I go back to LA tonight.

1634
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,310
- You haven't finished your screenplay.

1635
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,614
- It's finished.

1636
01:31:45,664 --> 01:31:48,414
(birds chirping)

1637
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,680
You know I loved all the
time we spent together.

1638
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:56,003
I mean, you were, you were
supportive and encouraging.

1639
01:31:57,609 --> 01:32:00,359
(birds chirping)

1640
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,920
I'm just sorry I didn't live up to it.

1641
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:09,663
Anyway,

1642
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,700
take care of him, Harry.

1643
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:18,476
(birds chirping)

1644
01:32:34,504 --> 01:32:37,504
(light piano music)

1645
01:32:40,522 --> 01:32:43,193
(coffee pouring)

1646
01:32:43,243 --> 01:32:46,243
(light piano music)

1647
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:52,692
- Hi.
- Hey.

1648
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,243
- Want some coffee?

1649
01:32:55,293 --> 01:32:58,293
(light piano music)

1650
01:33:11,113 --> 01:33:12,323
It's getting chilly.

1651
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:17,453
- Yeah, it was chilly when
I got up this morning.

1652
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:21,523
(light piano music)

1653
01:33:33,697 --> 01:33:36,114
- All this is coming in fast.

1654
01:33:37,286 --> 01:33:38,154
- I know.

1655
01:33:38,204 --> 01:33:40,850
(light piano music)

1656
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:44,380
There are so many things when
it comes to selling a house.

1657
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:46,203
- It'll keep you busy. It's a good thing.

1658
01:33:47,228 --> 01:33:50,470
(light piano music)

1659
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,993
- When do you have to go back?

1660
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,380
- I'll go back in a couple of days.

1661
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:58,793
We have to meet with the adoption agency.

1662
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:04,413
Prove to them that we're a
nice, stable, homosexual couple.

1663
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:08,030
- That's gonna be wonderful.

1664
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,293
- Yeah.

1665
01:34:11,147 --> 01:34:14,147
(light piano music)

1666
01:34:28,582 --> 01:34:31,101
(Lex sighing)

1667
01:34:31,151 --> 01:34:31,984
- Kenny.

1668
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:36,643
- Soon you'll be outta here
and starting over in LA.

1669
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:39,890
There'll be a million
things to keep you busy.

1670
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:43,011
You'll be okay.

1671
01:34:43,061 --> 01:34:46,061
(light piano music)

1672
01:35:11,029 --> 01:35:13,446
(jazz music)
