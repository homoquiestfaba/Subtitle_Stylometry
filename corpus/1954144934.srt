1
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,993
[Woman]
I'll always remember that day.

2
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,767
Marty and I
had just turned 14...

3
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,002
and we went
to an Ides of March party.

4
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,704
I went as Jackie Onassis...

5
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:51,341
in a pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat
and blood on my dress.

6
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,352
Well, ketchup, actually,
and other stuff too...

7
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,584
like macaroni
kind of glued on like brains.

8
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,524
It was more tasteful
than it sounds.

9
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:07,498
Everybody remembers that day,
exactly what they were doing.

10
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,978
[Male TV Announcer]
Thank you, Mrs. Kennedy, for
showing us your official home.

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,742
[Jacqueline Kennedy Narrating]
This is the White House,
the scene from the south lawn.

12
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,649
[Girl] This is the Pascal house,
as seen from the front lawn.

13
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,654
[Boy] Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. John F. Kennedy.

14
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,442
[Boy]
Where are we now, Mrs. Kennedy?

15
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,445
[Girl]
This is what is known as the Brown Room.

16
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,005
As you can see, there are
many wonderful pieces here.

17
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,882
The style of the room
is dictated by the mantelpiece...

18
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,115
which was the gift of Mrs.
Maurice Knowne from Des Moines, lowa.

19
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:09,753
This mantelpiece was donated by Mrs.
Noreen McCune of South Bend, Indiana.

20
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,264
It's really a treasure, and I wish
there were more people like Mrs. Knowne.

21
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:17,735
I wish we had more people
like Mrs. McCune.

22
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,738
[Jacqueline Kennedy] It's through this
door that all the heads of state come.

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,809
And here's where
the marine band plays...

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,811
and then everyone goes in to dinner
in the state dining room.

25
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,581
- [Boy] I'm rolling.
- Oh.

26
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,777
This is where
all the state dinners are given.

27
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,254
There were almost two
a month last year.

28
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,450
This is the main dining room,
where we entertain...

29
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,756
visiting heads of state
and their wives.

30
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:46,764
[Jacqueline Kennedy]
This room has the most
architectural unity in the White House.

31
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,597
I just think that everything in
the White House should be the best...

32
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,603
so when you find a room
like this, it's wonderful.

33
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,640
There's the China Room
and the Gold Room and the library.

34
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,075
This is the broadcast room.
This is the Red Room.
This is the diplomatic reception room.

35
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,148
This is the men's room.
This is the Green Room.
This is Lincoln's Cabinet Room.

36
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:05,684
The most formal room in the
White House... This room used to be...

37
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,754
[Jacqueline Continues,
Overlapping Speech]

38
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,292
Every room should have
a turnstile...

39
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,260
His office is really
a chamber of horrors now.

40
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,728
[Boy]
Jackie, no!

41
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,165
This used to be
Daddy's room.

42
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,297
I mean, um,
Mr. Pascal's office space.

43
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,377
- [Jacqueline's Speech Resumes, Faint]
- We shouldn't be in here.

44
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:35,413
The dining room
and formal room... cabinet room...
China Room... broadcast room...

45
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,508
- Blue Room... men's room...
- [Panting] This is a kitchen!

46
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,611
Just-Just a kitchen.

47
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,017
[Shouting]
This is the living room...

48
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:51,893
center for living
and leisure activities...

49
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,159
and boring piano lessons!

50
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,861
Ha-ha!

51
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,871
Come on, Marty!

52
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,666
Daddy-O!

53
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,678
[Yelling]

54
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,680
[Thunderclap]

55
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,054
Anthony, help me
masking-tape these windows.

56
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,130
- [Anthony] Puttin' those crosses?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,324
The Kennedys aren't
puttin' crosses on their windows.

58
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,333
They could really care.
They have ten other houses.

59
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,767
- It's like wearing garlic,
those crosses.
- It was on the news.

60
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,169
- It can't hurt.
- Yes, it can. It goos up the windows.

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,174
- Did Marty call?
- Last night.

62
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,074
- I know last night.
Did Marty call today?
- He's bringing a friend.

63
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,702
- What?
- He said he was bringing a friend.

64
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,280
- Male or female?
- I don't know.

65
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,909
- What did he say exactly?
- He said,
"Tell Mom I'm bringing a friend."

66
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,385
Why not me? Why not
"Tell Jackie I'm bringing a friend"?

67
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,548
I think it pertained to groceries,
bedrooms, like that... logistics.

68
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,990
Anthony, tell me everything
Marty said.

69
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,120
He said, "Hello, Anthony?"
I said, "Yeah, Marty?"

70
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,064
- He said, "Yeah." We said, "Hey."
- Marty said, "Hey"?

71
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,260
Not like, "Hey,"
like, "Hey!"

72
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,667
Like a noise.
Like a noise of jubilation.

73
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,264
- Marty was jubilant?
- At this point in the phone call.

74
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,344
At least he was doing
a fair impersonation of jubilant.

75
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,347
- Marty was pretending to be jubilant?
- Oh, my God.

76
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,679
- What's wrong with Marty?
- And who is this friend?

77
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,414
- And who is this friend? Exactly.
- How did he sound?

78
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,854
He sounded good.
He-He said he was good.

79
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:28,324
But he was lying.
He's not good. He hates New York.

80
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,056
- He's coming home.
- For Thanksgiving.

81
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,564
- For good.
- Did he say that?

82
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,897
- I don't know. Did he?
- No.

83
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,268
- How come nobody told me
about this friend?
- [Woman] Jackie.

84
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,967
Did I tell you
your brother's bringing a friend?

85
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,169
- [Jackie] What kind of friend?
- I don't know.

86
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,178
Marty's never had a friend before.
Who taped up the windows?

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,977
- I did. I saw it on the news.
- That tape leaves goo.
It goos up the windows.

88
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,850
Goo is what tape is all about. Goo is
what makes it tape, instead of paper.

89
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,854
A person offers a little
constructive criticism...

90
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,424
and a person gets lectured
on the nature of things.

91
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,390
I came in to ask something.
I can't think what it is.

92
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,952
- Ah, Anthony.
Did I make up the guest room?
- How should I know?

93
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:09,160
A person asks a civilized question,
and the person...

94
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,965
I'll go up and check. Did you
give your sister her medication?

95
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,972
Uh-huh.

96
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,746
[Wind Whistling]

97
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,633
[Sighs]
Maybe we should do the chandeliers.

98
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,932
- Were you this excited when I came home?
- That was different.

99
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,974
- You were dropping out of college.
- A good college.

100
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,204
- So, why did you leave?
- With Marty gone,
who was gonna take care of you?

101
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,712
- Mama.
- Yeah, right.

102
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,717
- I hear his car. I hear Marty's car.
- You can't hear cars.

103
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,584
- There's a hurricane.
- Where's my brush?
I had a hair brush right here.

104
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,697
Are we gonna make
a run for it?

105
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,733
Yeah.

106
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,931
[Tapping]

107
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,714
What did it look like?

108
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,046
It looked like a hairbrush,
like a brush you brush your hair with.

109
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,245
- Was it pink?
- Yes, it was pink, goddamn it.
It was pink.

110
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,254
It was pink,
and now it's gone!

111
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,257
I put it upstairs.
I didn't want it around the food.

112
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,623
It wasn't around the food.
The food is in the kitchen.

113
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,253
- It was on the same floor as the food.
- I have a comb.

114
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,628
I don't want a comb.
I want a brush.

115
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,463
- Combs straighten your hair out.
I want it to gleam.
- It is gleaming.

116
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,597
- It is not.
- It is. It is. I need sunglasses almost.

117
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,175
- It is?
- It is.

118
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,302
[Door Opens, Closes]

119
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,506
- Marty!
- [Grunts] Uh, Jackie!

[Marty Sighs]

122
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,491
- Lesly, this is Jackie-O.
- [Lesly] Hi.

123
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,998
My mother. Anthony.
Meet Lesly.

124
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:25,162
- Lesly and I are engaged.
- [Screams Hysterically, Laughs]

125
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,838
- [Through Laughter]
I have to find my hairbrush.
- Oh, I-I have a comb.

126
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,711
Marty, you're a wreck.
Give me your coat.

127
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,222
- I was in a hurricane, Mama.
I just came in from a hurricane.
- Oh, you look thin.

128
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,452
You're thin. You look so thin.
Oh, my God, I sounded like a mother.

129
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,961
- Didn't I sound just like a mother?
- You are a mother.

130
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,691
I know, but I still
can't believe it.

131
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,395
I look at you people and wonder,
however did you fit in my womb?

132
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,037
Marty, why don't you get the
fire really going like you do?
Anthony, you help him.

133
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,202
Squeeze the blower or something.
Lesly and I will check on dinner.

134
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,677
- Can I check on dinner too?
- No, you cannot.

135
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,715
- There's going to be girl talk in there.
- I like girl talk.

136
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,842
If you were there,
it wouldn't be girl talk, would it?

137
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,683
- Do I have to squeeze the blower?
- No, sweetheart.

138
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,417
You just have to do something
in some other location.

139
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,600
[Chuckles]

140
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,213
You have a lovely home.

141
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,547
- Home?
- Your house. It's lovely.

142
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:51,680
Oh, yes, it was. I mean, it is. I mean,
it will be until it gets blown away.

143
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,784
We'll all get blown away
to Oz or something.

144
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,797
- Can I help with anything?
- Oh, no. It's all under control.

145
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,400
So, Lesly, how long
have you known Marty?

146
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:08,530
- Um, about six months.
- And you know him pretty well, do you?

147
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:13,544
I don't know. I think so. I guess
you've met a lot of Marty's girlfriends.

148
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,946
- No, not really.
- Well, I hope I'm the first fiancee.

149
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,679
Oh, you're definitely the first
and, I hope, the last.

150
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,223
[Giggling]
Me too.

151
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,885
I had one great passion in my life.
Do you know what that was?

152
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,555
- Your husband?
- My husband. Precisely.

153
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,565
I didn't know he was my one
great passion until he was gone.

154
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:39,036
Till he was gone,
my one great passion was the man
I met that night at a party...

155
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,665
any man I met at a party who could use
a new adjective to describe me.

156
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,267
I really have no idea
who my children belong to.

157
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,438
All I know for sure is...

158
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:53,109
that Jackie and Marty
belong to each other.

159
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:57,451
Jackie's hand was holding Marty's penis
when they came out of the womb.

160
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:01,117
The doctor swore to me.
It's in some medical journal somewhere.

161
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,495
[Chuckles]

162
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:08,158
- I guess I should go freshen up now.
- Oh, do.

163
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,464
By all means.
Look at you, you're drenched.

164
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:19,140
- Anthony, did I put clean towels
out on the bed?
- How should I know?

165
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,874
Go and see.
And show Lesly to the guest room.

166
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:27,078
- Why not my room, Mama?
- You're not married yet,
are you, young man?

167
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,381
- [Anthony]
Are there sheets on the bed?
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,390
Make sure to show her how to
jiggle the toilet so it doesn't run.

169
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,358
[Logs Shuffling]

170
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,129
Marty, a word.

171
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,399
- A word, Mama, or many words?
- Oh, now, don't get snippy, Marty.

172
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,441
You've been in this house exactly
37 seconds, and you're already snippy.

173
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,707
It's no wonder your father
died young. He'd simply had
it with all this snippiness.

174
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,214
A person can die
a slow death...

175
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,716
from being snipped at
year after year.

176
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,650
The way he said "salad"
when he meant "solid."

177
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,382
Two of you would not let it go,
like a puppy with a rag doll.

178
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,550
- Daddy didn't die a slow death.
- Let's stick to the subject.

179
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,855
I have no idea
what the subject is.

180
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,522
- I'll tell you what the subject is not.
- No, Mama.

181
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:16,260
- That's too broad a category.
Tell me what the subject is.
- You. A fiancee.

182
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:21,032
- Here. Why?
- I love her, and I'm just trying
to follow procedure.

183
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,167
- Do you love her
for any particular reason?
- Why, you didn't like her?

184
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,270
I spoke to her for exactly 37 seconds,
Marty. Who is she? What does she do?

185
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,283
- She's a waitress
in the Donut King on 14th Street.
- Uh-huh.

186
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,910
- She smells like powdered sugar.
- [Chuckling]

187
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,923
Marty, men don't marry girls
who smell like powdered sugar.

188
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,553
They have a sweet little affair
with them, which they recall
fondly in their twilight years.

189
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,995
- Don't be such a snob.
- Marty.

190
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,590
Your sister has been out of
the hospital less than six months.

191
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,832
Last week she nearly lost it
because the seltzer water was flat.

192
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,430
And you bring a woman home.

193
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:01,070
Not just a woman, but a fiancee.
An anti-Jackie.

194
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,581
- Are you trying to push
your sister over the edge?
- No.

195
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,312
- Well, just what then
are you trying to do?
- Be normal.

196
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,719
[Sighs]
It's a little late for that, young man.

197
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,553
Do you want us to leave?

198
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,720
Yes, I want you to leave
at once, without further ado,
as soon as the storm lets up.

199
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,891
If you don't, I'll take away your
sheets, your towels, everything.

200
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,903
- Without "further ado."
- Yes. I'm getting dramatic.

201
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,132
Well, stop it.

202
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,668
What do I tell Lesly?

203
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,974
Tell her the truth.

204
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:41,610
- The truth.
- That your sister's insane.
She'll understand.

205
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,689
Don't say "insane."
She's ill.

206
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,452
Oh, if she were ill, I could give her
an aspirin, I could put her to bed...

207
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,256
I could make her that soup
you're supposed to make.

208
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,354
- Chicken noodle.
- That, exactly. But I cannot.

209
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,491
I mean, I can make the soup.
For heaven's sake, it comes in a can.

210
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:01,039
I cannot make her well.
I have tried.

211
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,836
I thought it was better that
I come and tell her myself.

212
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:08,107
It would be better not to tell
her at all. It would be better
if you had nothing to tell.

213
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:12,776
If there's anyone present who knows why
this marriage should not take place...

214
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,046
it is me.

215
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:19,147
- Why?
- Why what?

216
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,317
Why shouldn't this marriage
take place?

217
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,363
You know why.

218
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,695
Tell me.

219
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,201
[Chuckles]

220
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:36,741
Excuse me. I'm going to go baste
the turkey and hide the kitchen knives.

221
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,716
[Buzzing]

222
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,724
[lmitating Bee Buzzing]

223
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,902
[Thunderclaps]

224
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,442
So, those are the towels.

225
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,812
Do you like them?
'Cause I could get you others.

226
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,182
We have black ones
with Roman scenes on 'em.

227
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:25,348
Oh, that's okay.
These are dry.

228
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,516
This is just from the car to the door.
Can you believe it?

229
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,594
- Yes.
- It's a hurricane.

230
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,595
I know.

231
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,257
This is supposed to be
waterproof mascara. [Chuckles]

232
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:38,393
- You look lovely.
- Oh.

233
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,064
Did I show you
the toilet thing?

234
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,936
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

235
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,771
You just jiggle it.

236
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:49,143
Right. It hasn't worked right
since Jackie flushed Marty's lizard.

237
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,978
Oh, it got in there
by mistake?

238
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,109
No, on purpose.

239
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,915
- She flushed him on purpose?
- I think she was jealous.

240
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:01,618
- Marty loved that lizard.
It turned different colors.
- [Thunderclap]

241
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:06,528
- Well, I guess you wanna do
your mascara or somethin'.
- Yeah. [Chuckles]

242
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:11,592
Well, my mom put out bobby pins
and hair glop, brushes.

243
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,638
Everything you'd need.

244
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,435
So, if you want to do your hair,
you're set.

245
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,442
- I do.
- What?

246
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,172
Wanna do my hair.
You know, 'cause of the rain and all.

247
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,874
- It looks nice the way it is.
- Oh, come on.

248
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,417
- [Laughs] Oh, well.
- Really.

249
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,885
- I guess I'll see you at dinner.
- Yeah.

250
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,152
I hope you like turkey,
'cause that's what we're having.

251
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:37,820
Yes. I mean,
it's Thanksgiving.

252
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,058
- Did-Did I show you the toilet thing?
- Yeah.

253
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,567
- And the towels?
- Oh, right here.

254
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,766
Could you just check and see
if there are sheets, 'cause
my mother was all distracted.

255
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,774
[Both Chuckling]

256
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,881
- Yeah, there are.
- And pillows?

257
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,781
Anthony, I don't mean
to be unpolite...

258
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,583
but I'm kind of tired
and all, so...

259
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,181
- Oh. Oh! I'm sorry.
- [Laughs]

260
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:11,956
It's just... Well, we've
never had a guest before.

261
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,964
Never?

262
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,899
Never.

263
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,402
[Moaning]

264
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,382
- Hey.
- Marty.

265
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,213
The toilet's running.
[Grunts]

266
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:40,690
- It's making this strange noise.
- What are you doing?

267
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,557
Oh, I don't like
these shoes.

268
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,428
- They look fine.
- They skid. I nearly skidded.

269
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,331
- Come here.
- No.

270
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,496
- Why not?
- Lipstick.

271
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,505
Reapply.

272
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,507
Mmm.

273
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,012
You know, Lesly,
we don't have to stay here.

274
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,018
- Marty.
- What?

275
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,384
- Well, it's Thanksgiving.
- Nobody cares.

276
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,720
- Yeah, but we drove...
- We could drive back.
We could watch the parade.

277
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,817
- It's rained out.
- Says who?

278
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:20,228
The news. They showed Bullwinkle blowing
on the side of the Chrysler building.

279
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,391
Well, we can't miss that.
That settles it. We're going.

280
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,902
- [Giggling] Let go.
- I love your shoes.

281
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,064
- Stop it.
- You've met them.
They've met you. Let's go.

282
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,974
Oh, but they gave me towels
and bobby pins and everything.

283
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,047
- Bobby pins?
- It'd be rude.

284
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,139
They won't care.

285
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,444
[Exhales Sharply]
They don't like me.

286
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,854
- They love you.
- Oh, I wore the wrong clothes.

287
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,860
- No.
- I was in a hurricane, you know?

288
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,090
I mean, a person can't look all... Well,
when it's raining and it's blowing...

289
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,656
You looked beautiful.
You are beautiful. Kiss me.

290
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,237
They're your family.

291
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,172
You are my family.

292
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,971
Not yet.

293
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,078
[Slowly Inhaling,
Exhaling]

294
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,437
- [Jackie-O]
Did Marty tell you about me?
- [Gasps]

295
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,270
- Oh, yes.
- What did he tell you?

296
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,004
- How you were.
- How's that?

297
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,945
You know.
Glamorous.

298
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,984
- I spend most of my days
with my head in the toilet bowl.
- Oh, well...

299
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,815
Throwing up pills. I can't really
think when I take the pills...

300
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,822
and a person
needs to think.

301
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,688
I mean, if a person can't think,
what are they?

302
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,887
- Why are you taking the pills?
- The doctors make me.

303
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,931
Well, have you talked to them,
about not being able to think and all?

304
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,264
Oh, they'd just think
I was crazy in not taking my pills.

305
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,829
Well, most doctors are men,
you know. They think we're
all perpetually premenstrual.

306
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:13,241
Oh, well, we are. I mean,
except when we're actually having it.

307
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,370
- Sex?
- No.

308
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,210
You know, "the visitor."
[Giggles]

309
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,187
- That's what I call it.
- Are you saving yourself for marriage?

310
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,586
- How do you mean?
- Blood on the sheets, all that.

311
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,558
Well, we live together,
Marty and me.

312
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,254
Must be hard, saving yourself
for marriage when you live together.

313
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,695
- I'm not saving myself.
- No?

314
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,996
- You think I should've?
- If I were getting married,
I'd wanna check out the goods.

315
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,832
- Me too.
- How were they?

316
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,202
- The goods?
- Marty?

317
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,606
Oh, I can't describe.

318
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,272
- What's the wildest place
you've ever made love?
- With Marty?

319
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,841
- Yes.
- I can't talk like that
about your brother!

320
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,182
Pretend he's not my brother.
I do.

321
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,689
Well, this one time...
[Exhales Sharply]

322
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,851
- What?
- I can't.

323
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,895
- Why not?
- It's embarrassing.

324
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,398
- If you don't tell me,
I'll just get it out of Marty.
- Oh, he would never.

325
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,968
- Never what?
- Talk like that.

326
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,765
- Marty and I tell each other everything.
- Everything?

327
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,669
We're twins.

328
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,868
Did he tell you
about his other girlfriends?

329
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,936
- Did he tell you
about his other girlfriends?
- There was one, he said.

330
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,484
- Did he tell you about her?
- No. What was she like?

331
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,053
- Who?
- The girl.

332
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,146
She wasn't a girl.
She was a woman.

333
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,316
She was older than Marty.

334
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:38,123
No, they were almost exactly
the same age. Talk about glamorous.

335
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,790
She was glamorous.

336
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,801
I thought so.
Is she still here, in Washington?

337
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,395
- Very much so. I wonder...
- What?

338
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,999
- No, it's none of my business.
- What?

339
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,704
Well, if he plans to get together
with her while he's home.

340
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,646
- Why didn't he marry her?
- He couldn't.

341
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,149
- Why not?
- It was a family thing.

342
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,621
- Families objected?
- Something like that.

343
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,090
- He never told me.
- Men and their secrets.

344
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:12,357
- Not all men have secrets.
- We all have our secrets.

345
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,365
## [Piano, Somber]

346
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,290
[Anthony]
Jeez.

347
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:45,056
The fire's gone out already.
The rain must be comin' in.

348
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,131
Where's Jackie-O?

349
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,291
In her room.

350
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,235
- What she doing there?
- I don't know. Brushing her hair.

351
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,239
- ## [Stops]
- How's she doin'?

352
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,970
- I-I don't know. She's in her room.
- I mean, generally.

353
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,206
Good. I mean,
good for Jackie.

354
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,545
What does she do all day?

355
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,778
I-I don't know. I mean,
what does anybody do all day?

356
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,151
What do you do all day?
What do I do all day?

357
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,748
What do you do all day?

358
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,760
I don't know.

359
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,729
- She reads books.
- What kind of books?

360
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,698
- Assassination books.
- What else?

361
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,031
That's about it.

362
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,628
- How many assassination books
can there be?
- A lot.

363
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,038
Lincoln, McKinley,
Kennedy, King, Kennedy...

364
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,873
- All right.
- And she watches soap operas.

365
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,075
She likes it especially
when they have a character,
and that actress leaves the show...

366
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,344
and a new actress steps in
and becomes the character.

367
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,182
Nobody on the show notices
any difference, they just...

368
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,620
Jackie watches
soap operas?

369
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,023
I guess you heard
about the seltzer water thing.

370
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,563
That was the last big,
you know...

371
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,859
- It was flat.
- Yeah.

372
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,866
So what'd she do?

373
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:01,029
Well, she started screamin' about
bubbles, how there were no bubbles.

374
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,767
So she started boiling
the seltzer water.

375
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:08,471
When the water started bubbling,
she poured the boiling water
back into the seltzer bottle...

376
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,310
which was plastic and started
to melt and kind of melted...

377
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,816
into her hand
where she was holding it.

378
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,945
She had to go to the emergency room
with third-degree burns.

379
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,149
And on the way home, whenever
Mom and I asked her a question...

380
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,920
she'd tell us to,
"Stop giving me the third degree."

381
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,896
- [Chuckling]
- And she'd laugh,
kind of like, hysterically.

382
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,331
So, she's not what
you'd call "recovered."

383
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,460
Do you think I should stay?

384
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,301
Yes.
Yes, I do.

385
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,408
Uh, you're not supposed
to have that.

386
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,274
- What?
- The wine.

387
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,404
- Isn't there enough?
- There's enough, but...

388
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,279
- She's not supposed to have that.
- Why not?

389
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,353
- Because of her medication.
- Not this medication, Anthony.

390
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,150
The one before, I couldn't drink.
They've switched me.

391
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,350
I used to be green.
Now, I'm brown.

392
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,360
I wanted pills to match my eyes.
Color me beautiful.

393
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:01,489
Mama wants us to leave. She's afraid
I'm gonna push you over the edge.

394
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,331
Oh, I've been over the edge.
Now I'm back.

395
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,837
- [Marty] Lesly doesn't
know about the hospital.
- Oh?

396
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,464
She knows about the hospital,
but not what kind of hospital.

397
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,100
- Does she know about your hospital?
- Sort of.

398
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,509
Let me guess.
You had your appendix out?

399
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,014
- You did?
- No.

400
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,175
- Hey, Marty,
you wanna show me your scar?
- No.

401
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,049
[Jackie-O Chuckles]

402
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,588
I'm sorry about that, by the way.
I didn't mean to maim you.

403
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,284
- I only meant to kill you.
- Well, these things happen.

404
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:33,228
I've noticed Anthony wears a lot of
layers around me, don't you, Anthony?

405
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,562
Look at him. He's got a T-shirt,
a dress shirt, a vest and a jacket.

406
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,365
- I'm wearing a jacket
'cause it's Thanksgiving.
- You weren't wearing it before.

407
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,999
- I put it on after Marty got here.
- I appreciate it. It looks nice.

408
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,704
I got it at the Treasure Trove.
I think it belonged to a Kennedy.

409
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:52,215
- Why, is there a bullet hole?
- Marty, you're home.

410
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,480
The lady said Mrs. Kennedy
donated a bunch of stuff.

411
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,181
She was pretty sure this was
in the Kennedy batch.

412
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,190
See, Marty, you turned
the household upside down.

413
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,123
Anthony went out
and bought a jacket.

414
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,957
And I went to a lot of trouble
to get sane, so you can't just leave.

415
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,328
Lesly, on the other hand,
is free to go at any time.

416
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,368
[Tremendous Thunderclaps]

417
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,529
[Wind Whistling]

418
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,904
I've never been to a hurricane before.
Have you?

419
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,603
- [Together] Yes.
- When?

420
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:25,513
Before you were born.
We went to Virginia Beach.
Our motel was on the water.

421
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,348
Mom and Dad were drinking rum and Pepsi
out of Styrofoam cups and giggling.

422
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:33,220
All the good stuff happened
before I got born.

423
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:41,121
- This wine's not very cold.
- [Anthony] Mama forgot
to put it back in the icebox.

424
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,792
- I wish I had a piece of ice.
- I'll get you one.

425
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:47,133
- Oh, don't you go, Anthony.
Marty, fetch me a piece of ice.
- I'll get it for you.

426
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:51,106
Marty's been in the car all day.
I'm sure he'd leap at an
opportunity to stretch his legs.

427
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,904
He doesn't know
where we keep the ice.

428
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,913
- Everyone knows where
you keep the ice, Anthony!
- I'll get the ice.

429
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,475
Are you gonna be good
when Lesly comes down?

430
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,486
- Marty, I'm the hostess.
- Yeah.

431
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,618
Make sure it's cold.

432
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,991
- She's pretty, isn't she?
- Who?

433
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,228
- Who do you think?
- I guess.

434
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,635
She doesn't seem like Marty's type. Do
you think she seems like Marty's type?

435
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,903
- I don't know.
- Now, you and she would make
a cute couple.

436
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,001
Wow, I'd bet you're
just the same age.

437
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,137
They're getting married, Jackie.
She's got a ring.

438
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,147
- Tiffany's?
- I don't know.

439
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,581
I think she has
the sneak for you.

440
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,812
- Stop. I do.
- She's engaged.

441
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,788
So? She only just met you tonight.
Who knows?

442
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,121
These things happen
all the time.

443
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,695
- J-Jackie, I'm not gonna...
- What?

444
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,130
I don't know.

445
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,134
It's okay, Anthony.

446
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,761
I understand.

447
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,897
Understand what?

448
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,239
Just because Marty's attracted
to girls doesn't mean you have to be.

449
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,075
- I'm attracted to girls.
- Really? Are you sure?

450
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,206
- Yes!
- Hmm.

451
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,717
- [Sighs]
- Anthony, look.

452
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,782
Isn't that the prettiest ice cube
you've ever seen?

453
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,224
- It used to be bigger.
- I wonder what happened.

454
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,522
Whatever it was, it happened
just between the kitchen and here.

455
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,361
Look, Marty, your hands are all wet.
Now, there's a clue.

456
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,197
It probably melted
on the way.

457
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:28,739
Oh, my!
Good evening.

458
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,831
- Good evening.
- [Jackie-O] Is that an evening dress?

459
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,342
- I don't know.
- It certainly looks
like an evening dress.

460
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,379
- [Anthony] It's very pretty.
- Well, I dressed for dinner.

461
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,142
Would you like a glass
of liebfraumilch?

462
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,479
No, thank you.
I'll just have a glass of wine.

463
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:44,214
- That's the name of the wine.
- Oh. I don't speak French.

464
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,222
- Who does?
- [Anthony] You do.

465
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,384
- Oh, that's right, I do.
- So, what does that name mean?

466
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,428
In French?

467
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,394
- I think it means something German.
- Oh.

468
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,490
It means,
"Loving mother's milk."

469
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:00,037
- You speak French?
- No, German.

470
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,504
[Chuckling]

471
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,508
Well, I know how to say "I love you"
in sign language.

472
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,443
- Let's see.
- Oh.

473
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,879
Cool.

474
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,946
Don't leave this girl alone
with any handsome deaf-mutes, Marty.

475
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,080
- That's my advice to you.
- Jackie.

476
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,886
Tell me, Lesly, have you ever been
to Washington before?

477
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,553
[Coughing]
No.

478
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,290
Not even on a field trip?
Not even on a fifth-grade field trip?

479
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,060
No. I mean, my class went,
but I didn't go.

480
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,398
- In fifth grade, really?
- [Lesly] Sixth. Sixth grade.

481
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,098
So, you just snubbed it.
You just snubbed your nation's capital.

482
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,265
Um, my parents
wouldn't let me go.

483
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,900
- What's their number?
- What do you mean?

484
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,775
How could they have ruined
a perfectly good field trip?
People like that burn me up.

485
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,214
- Don't they burn you up, Marty?
- They didn't have the money.

486
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,286
What a lie.
How much could it have cost?

487
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,084
- Too much.
- Were you poor?
Did you eat chicken potpies?

488
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:57,787
Pancakes.
A lot of pancakes.

489
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,729
Pancakes.
Pancakes, Marty.

490
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,962
So, how did you pull yourself out?
Out of poverty, I mean.

491
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,969
I left Pennsylvania.

492
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:10,837
Well, that was a step
in the right direction, clearly.

493
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,536
Do they have paintings
in Pennsylvania?

494
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,012
- [Marty] Jackie. Come here.
- Why?

495
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,015
- What do you think you're doing?
- What do you think you're doing?

496
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,052
- You said you were gonna be nice.
- Just trying to keep
the conversation moving.

497
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,053
Just stop it.

498
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,055
[Jackie-O]
I've never been to Pennsylvania.

499
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,149
I've never even met anyone who's
been to Pennsylvania, much less
been from Pennsylvania.

500
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,854
No, Pennsylvania's just this state
that gets in your way...

501
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,863
when you have to go
someplace else.

502
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,832
Why do they call you
Jackie-O?

503
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,836
We went to
an Ides of March party.

504
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,635
I went as Jackie Onassis,
in a pink Chanel suit...

505
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,642
and a pillbox hat
and blood on my dress.

506
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,474
- Blood?
- Well, ketchup, mostly.

507
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,950
And other stuff too, like macaroni
kind of glued on like brains.

508
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,782
I don't think
that's funny.

509
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,824
Nobody else did, either.
Nobody talked to me all night.

510
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,790
I talked to you.

511
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:07,388
Yes, you talked to me.

512
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,990
Marty, Jackie-O wants
a "drink" drink.

513
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:14,435
Let's drink rum and Pepsi
out of Styrofoam cups.
Come on, Anthony darling.

514
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,474
Let's drink rum and Pepsi out of
Styrofoam cups. Bring us some ice!

515
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,635
- Oh, we're out of ice.
- How could we be out of ice?

516
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,940
Mama forgot to refill the trays.
I gave you the last cube.

517
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,244
- She's got a stash somewhere. I know it.
- [Anthony] The Pepsi's cold.

518
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,912
It's not the same. I'm not talking
about ice. I'm talking about texture.

519
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:34,014
I'm talking about texture.
In the last hurricane, we had ice.

520
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,992
Mama and Daddy had a bucket of ice
in a cooler down the hall.

521
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,189
We just marched down the hall
whenever we had a yen for ice!

522
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:44,962
[Crying] A person
gets her heart set on a certain thing.

523
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,663
- Yes.
- A person gets her heart set
on a certain thing.

524
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:53,233
And if a certain person
can't have a certain thing,
a certain person goes insane.

525
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,437
[Sighs]

526
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:59,607
I suppose you think I'm going insane
just to be fashionable.

527
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,550
- I don't think you're insane.
- You don't think I'm insane?

528
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:06,784
- No.
- You don't think
I'm an eensy, weensy bit insane?

529
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:10,383
I don't think you're insane.
I think you're just spoiled.

530
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:15,023
Oh, please. If people are going
to start telling the truth
around here, I'm going to bed.

531
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,466
[Tremendous Thunderclaps,
Glass Shattering]

532
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,303
- Does this happen a lot?
- Every goddamn hurricane.

533
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,640
We bought emergency candles.
They're right in the kitchen.

534
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,714
[Jackie-O] Anthony, did we remember
to buy emergency matches?

535
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,716
[Anthony] Nobody buys matches.
People find matches.

536
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,753
[Jackie-O] People buy matches,
Anthony, but not people like us.

537
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,137
- Oh, Mom.
- Thanks, Mom.

538
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,002
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

539
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,242
Oh, this'll be fun.
I've never had Thanksgiving
dinner by candlelight before.

540
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,214
- Oh, my God.
- [Anthony] What is it?

541
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,877
Dinner. Electric stove. Thanksgiving
dinner. I didn't even think.

542
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,855
- Oh.
- If I'd put in the turkey
one hour earlier, we'd be impervious.

543
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,983
Does anybody want
cranberry sauce?

544
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,257
- Just cranberry sauce?
- You can eat it raw.

545
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,128
It's not really raw.
It's been precooked.

546
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,866
- Jackie, is that a drink
you're drinking?
- This drink?

547
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,167
- Yes.
- No.

548
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,299
Anthony, is that a drink
she's drinking?

549
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,379
- It's liebfraumilch.
- Well, take it away from her.

550
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,176
- She said she switched medication.
- She's mistaken. Take it away.

551
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,809
- Jackie, you look tired.
Why don't you go to bed.
- I get bored in bed.

552
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,184
Well, I'm going to bed, and I think
everyone should do the same.

553
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,622
- It's still early.
- There's no television and no food.

554
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,160
What else is there
to stay up for?

555
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,322
- Conversation.
- Oh, that.

556
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,596
That only gets you into trouble.
Take it from one who knows.

557
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,376
Hey, the Kennedys' generator
turned on their security lights.

558

## [Piano]

559
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,840
[Lesly]
I remember that. I used to take lessons.

00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,375
- That was good.
- Can I have an at bat?

564
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,377
Mm-hmm.

569
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,008
Boy, it's been
a long day.

570
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,985
Not as long as yesterday.
Yesterday was 24 hours.

571
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:34,217
- I meant with traveling.
- It's no easier staying in one place.

572
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:39,024
- Take it from one who knows.
- Are you being wise?
I think you're being wise.

573
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,325
I knew it would happen one day.
I'd just wake up wise.

574
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,060
- One day I woke up stupid.
- You did?

575
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,396
- It was terrible.
- What did you do?

576
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,630
- I went back to sleep.
- That was wise.

577

[Both Laugh]

578
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,911
I'm tired, Marty.
I-I'm going up.

00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:57,742
- Are you coming up?
- Uh, soon.

580

Clean towels and a washcloth
are laid out on the bed.

581
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,890
Yell out
if you need anything.

582
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,694
[Jackie-O Laughs]

583
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,201

## [Continues]

585
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,414
- I did get your letter.
- Oh?

586
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,483
I've forgotten his name,
the one who was lousy in bed.

587
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,712
- Who was lousy in bed?
- But to be lousy in bed, you have
to be in bed, don't you?

588
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,051
- Who was lousy in bed?
- That actor.

589
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,592
Peter? Peter was lousy in bed?
I can't believe it.

590
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:46,254
- Tell me about Peter, Anthony.
- Uh, he wears black.

591
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,197
And he has a gap between his teeth.
He has green eyes.

592
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,963
One eye is squinty.
Like sexy, not like disfigured.

593
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,470
He's in love with Jackie,
you can tell.

594
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,100
He gets to hold her coat
for her, his heart breaks into
a million pieces on the floor.

595
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,201
So, Peter's in love
with Jackie-O?

596
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,042
- Don't use that word.
- What word?

597
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:08,346
Love. Love is for tiny people
with tiny lives.

598
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,012
No, Peter and I have
nothing in common.

599
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,590
Now, you and I, Marty,
have a great deal in common.

600
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:17,024
Parents. DNA.
Bone structure.

601
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,062
[Anthony] He doesn't look
like he'd be lousy in bed.

602
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,393
Anthony, we have something
to tell you.

603
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:26,402
Let's talk about Anthony. Let's express
some familial concern about Anthony.

604
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,268
- Now, Anthony, why aren't you at school?
- I dropped out.

605
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,308
- He dropped out.
- Yes, I know.

606
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,607
- Why did you drop out, Anthony?
- Why didn't you go off with her, Marty?

607
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,614
We're talking about you now.
We're expressing familial concern.

608
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,343
- No, you're not.
- We're not?

609
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,612
No, you're playing
the familial concern game.

610
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,019
Don't be so sincere, Anthony.
It's declasse.

611
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,454
I hear you crying at night
alone in your room.

612
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,826
I hear her crying at night
alone in her room.

613
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,559
You cry at night
alone in your room?

614
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,602
[Anthony] Hey, don't make fun of her.
I won't let you make fun of her.

615
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,696
I wasn't going to make fun of her. I was
going to ask her what she cries about.

616
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,799
What do you think?

617
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,108
You want somebody
for a very long time...

618
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,648
and then you have them.

619
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,718
And they love you.

620
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,152
And they make love
to you.

621
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,223
But it's not enough.

622
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,162
This is the truth
about sex.

623
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,560
Is that why Peter
was lousy in bed?

624
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:31,567
I'm not talking
about Peter, Anthony.

625
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:39,037
Jesus, I'm talking
about Marty.

626
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,168
[Sighs]

627
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,611
Why did you tell me?
I-I wish you hadn't told me.

628
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,842
- Oh, Anthony. You knew.
- I did not know.

629
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,579
- Come on. You knew.
- How old were you?

630
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,417
- Young.
- My whole life?

631
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:56,118
- Practically your whole life.
- I felt left out.

632
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,254
- [Marty] Little brothers
always feel left out.
- I felt majorly left out.

633
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,197
- Is that why you went crazy?
- No.

634
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,530
That's why you went crazy.
You were ashamed.

635
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,934
- I wasn't ashamed.
- Well, you should be.

636
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,836
- Oh, Anthony, don't be bourgeois.
- I'm not being bourgeois.

637
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,933
Don't call me bourgeois
just 'cause I know right from wrong.

638
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,342
- Does Lesly know?
- No.

639
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,971
- Well, are you gonna tell her?
- No.

640
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,210
- You're not gonna tell her.
- How can I tell her?
- You just tell her.

641
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,546
- Why?
- So she knows.

642
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,587
- I'll tell her.
- [Marty] Don't.

643
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,656
No, she's from Pennsylvania.
She'll understand.

644
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,453
- Entire towns are related.
- So, but that's like cousins.

645
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,028
- So?
- So, you're not cousins. You're twins.

646
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,393
Well, that explains
a great deal.

647
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,625
Why Mama insists on celebrating our
birthdays on the same day, for example.

648
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,134
I thought she was just being
chintzy with the party favors.

649
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:43,297
It would be bad enough if you were
just brother and sister, but twins!

650
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,136
Your moral outrage
is duly noted, Anthony.

651
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:50,270
- You are officially
a better person than us.
- It's like fucking a mirror!

652
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,679
Anthony
just said "fuck."

653
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,717
I know.
I heard.

654
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,379
Fucking a mirror.
That sounds painful.

655
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,480
Go upstairs.
Go upstairs and tell her, or I'll...

656
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,451
- I'll...
- [Whimpering]

657
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,996
- What?
- Be really mad.

658
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,195
- [Both Laughing]
- Don't!

659
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,203
- What?
- Do that.

660
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,274
- Okay, let's do something else.
Let's do mime.
- No.

661
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:21,902
Guess where I am.
I'm in a box, and I can't get out.

662
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,674
- No, I'm in a box, and I can't get out.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

663
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,842
But that wasn't a very good mime, Marty,
because I didn't see that at all.

664
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,284
- Why did you have to tell him?
- To get him out of the room.

665
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,855
- What if he tells Lesly?
- He won't.

666
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,221
- What if he does?
- Are you ashamed?

667
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,261
- Of what?
- Of us. Of what we have.

668
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:42,162
- Had.
- I don't recognize the past tense.

669
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,467
I'm not ashamed.

670
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,663
- What are you?
- I don't know.

671
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,139
I see other houses.
I see other lives, and...

672
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,110
- What?
- They're not like mine.

673
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,612
- They're not like mine, either.
- They could be.

674
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,615
Other lives
don't interest me.

675
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,982
That's what we always said.
But maybe we said that because
we thought we couldn't have it.

676
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,523
- Maybe...
- We could all move to Pennsylvania.

677
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,853
I should go up soon.

678
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,452
We're not going to bed
until one of three things happen.

679
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,965
The hurricane ends,
or we run out of rum.

680
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,365
That's two.

681
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,803
Hmm.

682
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,901
- [Knocking]
- Marty?

683
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,302
It's me.

684
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,675
- I have to talk to you.
- About what?

685
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,013
Stuff.

686
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,419
Well, okay, but I was just
getting ready for bed.

687
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,423
Can I help?

688
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,090
What did you wanna talk
to me about?

689
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,498
Where did you meet Marty?

690
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,499
At a party.

691
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,195
What did he say?

692
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:57,240
Well, there were no chairs.
There were two chairs.

693
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:01,402
Marty was sitting in one, and then he
got up, you know, to give me the chair.

694
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,605
I knew he wasn't
from New York.

695
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,909
So, you fell in love
with him?

696
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,110
- No, I thought he was gay.
- You did?

697
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,279
- Why?
- Well, everyone is.

698
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,415
In New York.
I mean, not me. Everyone. Men.

699
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:19,485
[Sighs]
And he was so beautiful, you know?

700
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:24,057
Do you think I am?
Beautiful?

701
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,693
- Well, you look like Marty.
- I do?

702
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:30,296
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause we're not exactly sure
we had the same father.

703
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:35,242
I mean, my mother always had
the same husband, but she was
kind of a free spirit.

704
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,247
- You know, like that?
- Does that bother you?

705
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,783
Well, I mean, if it did,
it wouldn't change anything.

706
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,318
I mean, I don't mean
to be Buddhistic or anything.

707
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,411
- Be what?
- Buddhistic.

708
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,616
Oh, that's okay.

709
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,194
- So, Lesly, how old are you?
- Twenty-three.

710
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,820
- Me too.
- Oh, I thought you were younger.

711
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:57,560
Well, I am.
What do you think about sex?

712
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:02,162
[Laughs]
Well, I mean...

713
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,433
sex is good
with the right man, but...

714
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:08,500
- You need to be careful, you
know, especially in New York.
- Careful.

715
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,445
- Diseases and all.
- Mental diseases?

716
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,607
I guess.

717
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:19,346
If somebody else fell in love
with you now, what would you do?

718
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:22,152
Tell them
I was engaged.

719
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,284
You-You wouldn't...
You wouldn't maybe check it out?

720
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:28,161
See if maybe he's got
something to offer, like that?

721
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,165
No.

722
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,504
Do l...
Do I have a fever?

723
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,116
- No.
- Are you sure?

724
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,186
- Pretty sure.
- Could you check again?

725
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:56,219
Well, you're warm,
but not like a fever.

726
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,226
More like warm.

727
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:03,288
It's because I'm sitting
next to you. I'm warm because
I'm sitting next to you.

728
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,960
- Anthony.
- What?

729
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,471
I don't know.
You know, like I said.

730
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:17,176
Lesly, can I hold your hand?
Just hold your hand.

731
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,148
Okay.

732
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,655
How'd you get that scar?

733
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,624
Oh, uh...

734
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,287
Well, Marty and Jackie
were playing French Revolution...

735
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,559
and they made me play
Marie Antoinette.

736
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:40,899
[Chuckles] Well, Marty's probably
going to be coming up pretty soon, so...

737
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:46,408
- I don't think so. He's with Jackie-O.
- So?

738
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,104
- Can I hold something else now?
- Anthony!

739
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,113
- Can I see your knees?
- No!

740
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,945
- Tell me about when you lost
your virginity.
- No!

741
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,315
Tell me something.

742
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,684
I don't know
what to tell you.

743
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,848
Anything.

744
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,949
Do I have a fever?

745
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,518
- I already checked before. Twice.
- I know.

746
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,525
I think I have
a brain tumor.

747
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,534
You do?

748
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,570
And you know what
the big tragedy of that is?

749
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,696
- You'll die?
- Yeah.

750
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:21,210
I'll die without ever having,
you know...

751
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,410
- You've never...
- No.

752
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,814
It's not that big a tragedy.

753
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,978
I mean, unless you're with exactly
the right person, it's not that great.

754
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:34,285
- It's not that great?
- No.

755
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,883
Like, if they smoke,
they taste like ashes, you know?

756
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,158
Or they, like, stick their
tongue in your ear so much
you get, like, chapped ears.

757
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,789
Wow.

758
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,392
Or they're just big liars and will
say anything to get in bed with you.

759
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,403
- Lesly.
- Mm-hmm.

760
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:53,101
I don't smoke,
I won't stick my tongue in your ear...

761
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,145
and I will always
be honest with you.

762
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,407
Well, thank you.

763
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,712
But, please.
Anthony, it's... it's too weird.

764
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,014
Doing it with two brothers?
It's like incest.

765
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,021
[Laughs]

766
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,228
Lesly, about incest...

767
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,332
I have two words
to say to you.

768
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,602
Jackie-O and Marty.

769
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,875
Jackie-O and Marty.

770
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,814
How do you know that?

771
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,215
They told me.

772
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,481
- Who told you?
- Jackie.

773
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,615
- Huh.
- Then Marty.

774
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,358
Marty too.

775
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,990
I don't believe you.

776
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:56,228
All right.
Let's go for five.

777
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,239
Ready.

778
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,676
Go.

779
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,754
[Exhales]

780
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,483
Mmm.

781
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,617
Oh, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

782
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,787
There's this thing
I've heard...

783
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:24,061
and if I thought for one second
it was true, I'd probably kill myself.

784
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,625
Does your fiancee work
in a donut shop?

785
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,105
- A Donut King, actually.
- A Donut King?

786
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,905
So, is she, like, the queen?
Are we entertaining royalty?

787
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,675
She would be more like
a donut lady-in-waiting.

788
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:42,377
So, she's sort of
a-a marginal donut figure?

789
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:46,081
In all fairness, she is a minor
and not a major donut figure.

790
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:50,182
It's a chain, you see. There are
women like her all over the city.

791
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,058
- My point, exactly.
- No, my point. My point, Jackie.

792
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,030
There are women like her
all over the city. I know that.

793
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,967
But this one belongs to me.
I have chosen to love her.

794
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,131
- It wasn't thrust upon me by...
- Destiny?

795
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,368
I'm going to bed.

796
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,172
- Can I come?
- No.

797
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,647
- Jackie, I love her.
- [Scoffs] Love.

798
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,810
Yes, love. Love.
I'm tired of being above everything.

799
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,889
- I wanna be a human being.
- Okay, then, let's be human beings.

800
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,788
You don't know how!

801
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:30,923
You didn't come
to my hospital.

802
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,264
You didn't come.

803
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,964
- I came.
- They didn't tell me.

804
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,973
I came at night.

805
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:43,240
I stood under your window.
I watched you put on your makeup.

806
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:46,145
I watched you
cry it off.

807
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:49,810
I knew I was the one
making you crazy...

808
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,286
so I left
and went to New York.

809
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,949
But I'm not crazy now.
I'm better.

810
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:58,550
I watch soap operas.
I bake brownies.

811
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,961
- Normalcy is coursing through my veins.
- I want you to have a life.

812
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,762
I want you to love someone
you're allowed to love.

813
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,531
I miss you.

814
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,129
I miss you so much.

815
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,505
I miss you.

816
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,673
When I was with Peter...

817
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,513
I couldn't come
without seeing your face.

818
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:29,715
When you make love to that Lesly girl,
do you see my face?

819
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,863
Sometimes.

820
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,026
My face how?

821
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,162
From when?

822
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,740
The night we went
to the party.

823
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,209
The Ides of March party.

824
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,280
Yes.

825
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,281
You ran
into the room.

826
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,045
Your slip.
Pillbox hat.

827
00:50:56,153 --> 00:51:01,591
And heels.
I got to wear heels.

828
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:05,457
And Mama's stockings
with the seams.

829
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,122
You walked
over to the couch.

830
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,995
I was waiting
for my skirt.

831
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,467
Macaroni wouldn't dry.

832
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,529
And I followed the seams
of your stockings.

833
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:20,508
Then I was afraid.

834
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,511
So I began the game.

835
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,880
Marty, look.

836
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,105
Marty.

837

[Sighs]
You look lovely.

838
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,617
I have everything.
The dress. Everything.

839
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,023
- The dress?
- The suit. I could put it on.

840
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,653
- Don't.
- Oh, for old time's sake.

841
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:16,493
- Lesly might come down.
- She won't come down.

842
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,000
- How do you know?
- She won't come down.

- [Anthony] Where you going?
- To Marty's room.

846
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,942
- He's not in his room.
- How do you know?

847
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:31,605
- Lesly, you don't want
to go down there now.
- I have to.

848
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,740
Damn.
I broke my heel.

849
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,614
H-Here, give it to me. Let me fix it.
I always carry crazy glue.

850
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,314
- How long does that take?
- I have to read the instructions.

851
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,856
- Oh, Jesus!
- It works overnight.

852
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,984
I can't wait that long.
I'll go barefoot.

853
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:49,259
Wait. L-Let me fix it for you. It
doesn't need overnight. That was a lie.

854
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,927
Anthony, not five minutes ago, you said
you would always be honest with me.

855
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,130
I lied to keep you here,
upstairs.

856
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,366
I can't stay here.

857
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:02,673
- Is my shoe ready yet?
- Lesly, if you go down there,
you might see something.

858
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,679
- I know.
- Carnal.

859
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,716
- I know.
- So, why put yourself
through it? Don't go.

860
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,843
- Can I have my shoe now?
- No.

861
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,354

- [Marty] Put it down.
- [Jackie-O] There's no bullets.
See for yourself.

866
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,295
- [Marty] Just give it to me.
- [Glass Clinking]

867
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,709
But the blank.

868
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,871
- They'll hear the blank.
- In the storm?

869
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,881
It's getting quiet.

that day?

The day
of the party?

874
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,093
The day he was shot.

Exactly what they were doing.

876

was leaving.

881
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,273
She covered him
with her body.

882

She tried
to keep him there.

883

She'd tried to keep his head on,
but it was falling off.

- I was in a state of confusion.
- That's because we were
in the heat of passion.

- I wasn't in the heat of passion.
- I'm closin' my ears.

that you were Marty.

- I'm not taking a cab.

970
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:17,061
How are you getting
to the train?

971
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:20,397
- I'm not taking the train.
- Well, then how are you
getting back to New York?

972
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,939
- Marty'll drive me.
- Marty's needed here.

973
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,338
- Marty's needed there.
- Oh!

974
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,934
- You'll find a replacement.
- No, I won't.

975
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:33,982
You already have.

976
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:39,453
- Were you spying on us?
- A mother doesn't spy.
A mother pays attention.

977
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,023
Marty won't let me go without him.
He loves me.

978
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,025
You're just a symbol
to him, dear.

979
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:48,029
A symbol of all
that is good and pure.

980
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,190
I'm not a symbol.

981
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,700
Well, not anymore.

982
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:57,864
Please don't tell him about Anthony.
Please. It'll only hurt him.

983
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,943
It's a little late
to worry about hurting Marty.

984
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:06,709
- He never has to know about it.
- Now, you can see that Jackie
was a very sick girl.

985
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,716
She needs her family.

986
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,786
She has you.
She has Anthony.

987
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,412
We were beside the point,
as far as Jackie was concerned.

988
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:16,583
Jackie-O should learn she can't
always have everything her way.

989
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,456
Listen to me,
Little Miss Messy.

990
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,793
You have no idea how close you came
to getting badly hurt tonight.

991
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,333
You should feel lucky
that Jackie hasn't decided that...

992
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:29,234
what she wants is you...
out of the picture.

993
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:34,640
Jackie can have everything her way.
She always has.

994
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,235
Is that how
you raised them?

995
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:40,747
- People raise cattle.
Children just happen.
- They don't just happen.

996
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,115
You could read Dr. Spock from
now until doomsday, but children
just happen all the same.

997
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,586
This one has blue eyes,
that one's insane.

998
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,589
Well, she can't have Marty.
Marty's mine.

999
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:52,991
Please. Marty's maybe been
sort of yours for... six months?

1000
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,655
He's belonged to Jackie
for 20-odd years.

1001
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,029
Really odd.

1002
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:02,503
Leave this morning, or Marty
finds out how you spent the night.

1003
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,732
Your choice.

1004
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:09,369
Leave now with your
symbology intact...

1005
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,470
or stay and lose
Marty anyway.

1006
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:15,676
So what if I slept with his brother?
He slept with his sister!

1007
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,944
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1008
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,955
I'm sure you do.

1009
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:24,390
"Sure."

1010
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,791
One can never
be sure.

1011
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,626
Don't forget
your toothbrush.

1012
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,346
[Clattering]

1013
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,610
Oh, don't clean, Mother.
Honestly.

1014
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,156
- Don't we have a maid?
- Not anymore.

1015
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:32,717
- What happened to her?
- She quit, when you shot your brother.

1016
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:36,355
- Oh, that's right. [Yawns]
- [Yawns] What's for breakfast, then?

1017
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,433
- He speaks.
- Croissants.

1018
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:41,935
They're in the kitchen. They're filled
with something. I forget what.

1019
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:45,098
- Mm. I guess we'll find out.
- Oh, how exciting.

1020
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:48,040
Don't you find life
to be exciting?

1021
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,045
What's that gun
doing there?

1022
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,638
- That's not a gun, it's a camera.
- It is too a gun.

1023
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,876
- It's a camera that looks like a gun.
- Give it to me.

1024
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,510
- [Marty]
Relax, Mama. It's an empty gun.
- How do you know?

1025
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,055
- I checked.
- What is it doing there?

1026
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:04,558
Just being gunlike.
"Gunesque." "Gunonic."

1027
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,652
- Where did it come from?
- God?

1028
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,731
We were taking a trip
down memory lane.

1029
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:14,098
- I want it now.
- I'll put it away.

1030
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:17,434
- Marty?
- I'll put it away.

1031
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:24,869
Mother?
You look so white.

1032
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,506
Oh, Jackie.

1033
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,178
If it happens again, they'll put you
away, they'll just put you away.

1034
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:36,918
- Only if someone finds out.
- She must have family somewhere.

1035
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,085
- What are you talking about?
- Lesly.

1036
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:42,164
- I'm not going to shoot Lesly.
- Just don't.

1037
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:45,028
That's all we need
is Marty mooning over some dead girl.

1038
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,125
She's leaving anyway.

1039
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:49,727
- When?
- This morning.

1040
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,740
- Why?
- I suggested it.

1041
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,969
- And she agreed?
- More or less.

1042
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,274
- Is Marty going with her?
- Don't be silly...

1043
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:02,010
If he leaves again, I'll implode!
I'll just implode.

1044
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,109
He's staying.

1045
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,949
- Well, where is she now?
- Packing, I imagine.

1046
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,618
- She's packing?
- [Whispering] As we speak.

1047
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,753
What if she
forgets something?

1048
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,594
We'll burn it.

1049
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,602
- [Laughs] Yes. Yes.
- Mm. Mm.

1050
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,706
Mm!

1051
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,252
What? Wha... Oh...
You can't leave like this.

1052
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,384
- Not in the storm.
- I've gotta get Marty out of here.

1053
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,826
Can I come?
I wanna go to New York.

1054
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:50,160
Well, uh,
you can't come with us.

1055
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:53,292
Here. Put everything back.
Don't leave.

1056
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:56,269
How can you stay with him
when you know? You know!

1057
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,602
I don't know.
I don't know!

1058
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,971
We could go to Pennsylvania.
What's the name of your town?

1059
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,011
- You've never heard of it.
- But I want to hear of it.

1060
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:06,377
Anthony, I'm not going to go
to Pennsylvania with you.

1061
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:10,384
I'm not going to New York with you.
I'm not going to the 7-11 with you.

1062
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,284
- [Sniffs]
- Stop smelling my clothes.

1063
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:16,381
[Sighs]

1064
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:19,518
I will never love
another woman.

1065
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:22,324
I will go to the desert
and love only sand.

1066
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,131
Sand?
What does that mean?

1067
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:29,534
You never go hungry
in the desert, Lesly. You know why?

1068
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:33,233
- Why?
- Because of the "sand which is" there.

1069
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,442
[Toilet Flushes]

1070
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:46,549
- Is it away?
- Yes.

1071
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:49,021
- Did you hide it?
- I put it somewhere.

1072
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,116
- But did you hide it?
- Mother...

1073
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:55,323
Only in the sense that
I put it somewhere, and
no one saw me put it there.

1074
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,492
If I walked into the room where
you put the gun, could I see it?

1075
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,433
- No.
- Then it's hidden.

1076
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,732
Don't worry, Mama,
we won't bloody the carpets.

1077
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,739
You actually think
I'm worried about my carpets?

1078
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,810
- Aren't you?
- A little.

1079
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,345
I had to steam-clean
last time...

1080
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,847
and there's still
sort of a shadow.

1081
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:19,349
Stop!

1082
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:23,423
- Stop! Get off!
- [Giggles]

1083
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:28,056
- [Laughs]
- Get off. Stop!

1084
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:35,229
My! You're up early.
Did you sleep all right?

1085
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,237
Why are you wearing
that costume?

1086
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,239
Everything else
was in the wash.

1087
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,469
There's croissants in the kitchen.
No pancakes today, I'm afraid.

1088
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,979
- I have to talk to Marty.
- Mm, I wonder what about.

1089
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,454
You were supposed
to sneak in my room last night.

1090
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,047
- Ah! I fell asleep.
- Did you?

1091
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,058
No.
He stayed up.

1092
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,594
- By yourself?
- With me.

1093
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:05,030
Uh, the hurricane took the Kennedy
stables. The horses got loose.

1094
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,295
Secret Service were
all over the place.

1095
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,394
I didn't hear
any horses.

1096
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:12,804
What jumped over the moon?
A cow or a horse?

1097
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:16,901
- A cow.
- Oh. I thought it was a horse.

1098
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:20,243
- No, a cow.
- Ah... Wh-What's the rest of it?

1099
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,510
Uh, I know silverware
was involved...

1100
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,644
- "Hey, Diddle Diddle..."
- Lesly, you're up.
I see you're all packed.

1101
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,882
- Yes.
- [Whispers] I'll call you a cab.

1102
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,221
I don't need a cab.

1103
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:34,160
- How are you getting
to the train station?
- I'm going with Marty.

1104
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:37,289
- [Mrs. Pascal]
Marty's going to drive you?
- He's coming with me.

1105
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,495
[Whispers]
Oh! I don't think so.

1106
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:44,300
[Lesly]
He can decide for himself.

1107
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,374
To make a decision,
a person needs all the facts...

1108
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:50,536
and I don't think Marty
has all the facts.

1109
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:54,946
Ah! Anthony. How did you sleep?
Did you sleep all right?

1110
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,780
- What?
- Lesly, how did you sleep?
Did you sleep all right?

1111
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,719
- Yes, thank you.
- Did Anthony sleep all right?

1112
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:04,725
- Why don't you ask him?
- Marty, why don't you ask
your brother how he slept?

1113
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:08,524
- Why?
- Jackie, why don't you ask
your brother how he slept?

1114
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,531
- How'd ya sleep, Marty?
- Your other brother.

1115
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:13,568
How'd ya sleep,
Anthony?

1116
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:17,002
What's going on?

1117
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,837
Lesly stayed with me
last night.

1118
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,811
Ah. A quaint Pennsylvania
prenuptial custom.

1119
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:29,043
[Mrs. Pascal]
I am shocked. Young lady,
what do you have to say for yourself?

1120
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:31,244
Call me old-fashioned,
but I'd say the wedding's off.

1121
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,186
- It's just as well.
I always cry at weddings.
- I've even cried at mine.

1122
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,782
- Must have had a premonition.
- Mm.

1123
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,327
- Get out.
- That's right.

1124
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:43,830
Anthony, take this harlot
to the train station.

1125
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,763
- Get out!
- [Gasps]

1126
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,706
Jackie?
Jackie?

1127
01:11:56,512 --> 01:12:00,107
If you really cared for her,
you wouldn't have brought her here.

1128
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:02,740
I wanted to come here.

1129
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:06,287
And you did... come.

1130
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:08,788
- Or didn't you?
- Don't.

1131
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,859
You don't deserve her.

1132
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:20,801
How was he?

1133
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,473
I can't tell you.

1134
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:29,567
That good, huh?

1135
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,238
It was his first time.

1136
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,441
Yeah. Right.

1137
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,554
You mean it wasn't?

1138
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,924
What do you think?

1139
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,927
Then why would he say it?

1140
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,293
To get laid.

1141
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:56,465
Well, I'm sorry, but when
somebody says something,
I tend to think it's the truth.

1142
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:59,234
It's just the way I am,
the way I was brought up...

1143
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:03,300
and if somebody forgets
to mention something, I wouldn't
think to ask, for example...

1144
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,937
"Did you sleep
with your sister?"

1145
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:12,685
Do you think masturbation counts
as infidelity?

1146
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:17,088
- What do you mean?
- When I sleep with me and not
you, am I cheating on you?

1147
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,319
Marty, stop it!

1148
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:21,760
I came
downstairs before.

1149
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:28,292
- Before when?
- During it. The thing.

1150
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,962
What thing?

1151
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,972
The thing with the gun.

1152
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,235

1153
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:39,712
Oh, God.

01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:52,489
- He's going to leave again.
- Jackie, don't be insane.

1157
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:56,325
- I'm sorry, I mean...
- Warmer. Warmer. Colder.

01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:16,584
Anthony, get your sister
her medication. You know where it is.

[Toilet Flushing]

1166
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,928
No, Anthony.
Don't bother.

1167
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:31,591
I'm fine. Really. I just
got turned around for a second there.

1168
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,830
Everything's going to be okay.
I know that. Silly me.

1169
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,168
I just haven't had
my coffee yet.

1170
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:40,639
I haven't even
gone to the bathroom.

1171
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:43,768
- Mama, will you make us some coffee?
- Of course. Of course.

1172
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,370
I'm fine.

1173
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,547
Do you want me
to leave?

1174
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,855
- You gotta help me.
- How?

1175
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:04,058
Talk me back.
Tell me about Sundays.

1176
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,226
You and I.
Doin' a Sunday.

1177
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:11,773
- We-We get up...
- Right, right. We get up.

1178
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,774
What about the alarm?
Did the alarm go off?

1179
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:16,344
No. No alarm, baby.
It's Sunday.

1180
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,777
[Laughs]
Oh. Yeah, it's Sunday.

1181
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,974
And w-we don't wake up
till after 11:00...

1182
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,551
and I pull the comforter
over your shoulder.

1183
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:26,485
I grab your hand,
and I pull you down onto me.

1184
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:29,580
You have little rings, mascara rings
like a football player.

1185
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:33,127
And you have bad breath,
but I kiss you anyway.

1186
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:37,790
I watch you dress.
I feel sad when you buckle your bra.

1187
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,869
"There they go," I think.
"There they go."

1188
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:44,166
- Lose my other shoe.
- I find your other shoe.

1189
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,673
We read menus
in the windows on Avenue A.

1190
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,505
And then we go to Noel's Cafe, and
I figure out what Eggs Florentine is.

1191
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,511
[Marty]
Like Benedict is Spanish.

1192
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,173
- And the waitress says,
"Toast, or pita?"
- [Together] "Toasterpita!"

1193
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,217
Oh, what about the newspaper?
We forgot to buy the newspaper.

1194
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,583
Later, newspaper comes later.
We go to Central Park,
and you buy me some tulips.

1195
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,122
- Pink.
- Mm, and I buy you a scarf.

1196
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,489
- Blue.
- And a Sunday paper. We go home.

1197
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:09,360
It's late afternoon,
and the sign comes on.

1198
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:12,695
- "Jesus Saves."
- Across the street.

1199
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,928
"Jesus Salva."

1200
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,937
We run a bath.

1201
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,939
You wash my back.

Bird shoulders.

1204
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:29,615
We make love. Then we make coffee
and sit and read the paper.

- Ye...
- Mm.

1208
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:57,075
Marty, I want you to leave with me.
I want you to leave with me right now.

1209
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,545
Yes. All right.

01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,479

1212
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,511
Who was that?

1213
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,183
I just flushed your car keys
down the toilet.

1214
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,658
- Marty, give me your keys.
- Uh, I don't have them.

1215
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,661
- Where's your extra set? Get them.
- In my room.

1216
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,663
- At home in New York.
- I'll call a cab.

1217
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:22,729
- The phone's dead.
- Don't look at me.

1218
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:26,797
Marty's not gonna stay here with you. We
are leaving for New York this morning.

1219
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:28,808
I don't care how.

1220
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,936
Anthony told me about you.
He told me what you did to that lizard.

1221
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:35,210
Oh, Anthony! Not that old lizard story.
[Laughs]

1222
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:39,219
I know what else you did.
I know where the scar came from.

1223
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,380
I know why they sent you
to that hospital.

Look at yourself.
Look at your clothes.

1227
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:54,600
You're making fun of a woman
who lost her husband.

1228
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:58,639
A man died. A man was murdered. A man
who did something for other people.

What have you ever done
for somebody else?

You really love Marty?
Think about what his life would
be like here in this house.

Your mom will die.
You'll be left alone.

1232
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:12,311
You'll have babies
with webbed feet you'll have
to bury out back in the yard.

Where exactly in the yard?
Marty?

1236
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,600
Where do you think we should
bury these babies with webbed feet?

1237

The back yard's getting rather
crowded with corpses. First,
Daddy's, and now duck babies.

- Not me. Mama.

not for him... for the air conditioner.

That's all I ask.

A close family like ours
has to stick together.

1264
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:56,877
We cleared out a nice place for him
out back, next to Daddy...

1265
01:20:56,985 --> 01:21:02,321
so he can stay right here,
where he belongs... with me.

1266
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,785
That Lesly girl
never really loved Marty.

1267
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:11,525
She hightailed it back to
Pennsylvania the first chance she got.

But I think she'll always
remember that day.
