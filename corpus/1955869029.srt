00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,927
They'd be more concerned about

181
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,095
this week's soccer match
against Southside.

182
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,388
Southside. Shit.

183
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,292
Okay. You're gonna have
to do extra credit.

184
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,709
Extra credit sucks monkey balls.

185
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,444
If Miss Martin tries
to walk with us,

186
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,279
I'm going to shoot
myself in the face.

187
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,881
She seems really lonely.

188
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,649
I should see if she's
interested in Coach Bruner.

189
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,984
He's single.

190
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,419
Hey, Lacey, you're
close with April.

191
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,123
I mean, do you think you could
maybe talk to her for me?

192
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,992
Eric, I know you love her.
I believe you.

193
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,894
But if you're going to
different colleges anyway,

194
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,129
I just don't see
how it could work.

195
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,731
I just don't wanna end
up one of those people

196
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,000
who's single and lonely
their whole life.

197
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,434
Hi, friends.

198
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,770
Hey, Miss Martin.

199
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,838
Oh, no, you can call me Sylvia.

200
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:12,575
Everybody, you can.
All of you can.

201
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,611
Eric, um, you're the
class president.

202
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,413
Yeah. I knew that.

203
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,816
I was just wanting to
maybe discuss, um,

204
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,517
the Student Choice Awards

205
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,488
and how perhaps there is
a petition going around

206
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:30,794
about how people want to get
rid of the V.I.P. Elite.

207
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,361
I don't know if it's...

208
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,963
- [school bell rings]
- true.

209
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,632
You know what? Now's not
really a good time.

210
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,602
Oh. I'll walk you to class so
you don't get a tardy slip.

211
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,604
That's so cute.

212
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,729
Oh, thank you.

213
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,612
I'm gonna walk you to class.

214
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,614
It's okay.

215
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,616
I won't get a tardy slip.

216
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,375
You know who I am.

217
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,879
I'm Eric Schultz.

218
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,081
Yes, um, could you
please page Eric Schultz

219
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:35,051
and have him come to
my office immediately?

220
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,110
Thank you. Please.

221
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,135
Hey.

222
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,937
That's your mom, right?

223
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:54,971
Yeah.

224
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,340
She is such a V.I.P.

225
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,142
Oh, speaking of which,

226
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,810
since you are the frontrunner
to be the V.I.P. this year,

227
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,180
any comment on the fact there's
a petition to get rid of it?

228
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:08,017
[feedback over speaker]

229
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,818
God, they really need
to fix that thing.

230
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,955
Eric, you need to
go see Miss Martin.

231
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,322
You can understand that?

232
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,690
Of course.

233
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,792
[feedback over speaker]

234
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,628
Damn it! We're having
fish sticks again.

235
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,954
Ugh.

236
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,630
[door closes]

237
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,219
Eric, thank you so much
for coming to my office.

238
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,388
It just, it seems like
there's a little issue

239
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,056
with the transcript, but...

240
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,624
No, no. That's gonna scare him.

241
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,360
Okay, Eric, we're just gonna...

242
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,998
I'm gonna help you
do whatever...

243
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,165
Shit!

244
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,901
Okay, um, let's be best friends.

245
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,527
Oh, God, really?

246
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,553
- [door opens]
- Uh...

247
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,121
What are you doing?

248
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,257
Why do you have a picture
of my parents in here?

249
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:58,227
We went to high... We went
to high school together.

250
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,419
Okay.

251
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,735
- What's that list?
- It's none of your business.

252
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,661
It's a little bit creepy.

253
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,742
You have no right to
go through my stuff.

254
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,337
You think you can do
whatever you want.

255
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,985
The whole world bows
down to Eric Schultz.

256
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:27,956
Um... maybe I should go.

257
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,449
Fine. Don't graduate.

258
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,162
What?

259
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,922
What? Um...

260
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,104
Yes.

261
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:46,175
Okay, um, you are set to
graduate in two months.

262
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,677
But in order to graduate,

263
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,447
one must pass all of
one's required courses.

264
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,316
I have a 3.9.

265
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,952
Of the classes you took.

266
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,822
You didn't take Humanities
your freshman year.

267
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,524
Humanities? Wait. Hold on.

268
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:04,293
No one ever told me I needed
to take Humanities, ever.

269
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,619
Okay, so...

270
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,561
Shit.

271
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,507
What do I do?

272
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:23,112
Well, you could take the class
when it's offered next,

273
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,047
which would be in the fall,

274
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,216
which would make you
graduate at Christmas.

275
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,785
No way. I need to graduate now.

276
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,655
Eric, you're...

277
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,148
you're not going to graduate.

278
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,694
Okay.

279
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,963
Look, there's gotta be
some way around this.

280
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:44,867
Right, I mean, because
for people like you,

281
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:48,261
there's always a way around
things, isn't there?

282
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,874
You own this school.

283
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,509
What are you talking about?

284
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,268
Did I do something to you?

285
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,150
Do you wanna know
what's on this list?

286
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,219
Sure.

287
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,088
This is a list of things I was
never able to do in high school

288
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,424
because I wasn't...

289
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,260
I wasn't popular enough

290
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,497
or pretty enough,

291
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,788
cool enough.

292
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,737
This list would be so
easy for people like you.

293
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:26,875
Look, I'm sorry that
your high school sucked.

294
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,545
I am. I'm just...

295
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,380
I need to figure out
how to graduate here.

296
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,048
So, I mean, you're the
guidance counselor.

297
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,775
Can you please just tell
me what I need to do?

298
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,789
The list.

299
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,615
What about the list?

300
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:48,531
You could help me
complete the list.

301
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,223
Here.

302
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,604
I think you'd be arrested

303
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,373
if you tried to do half
the things on here.

304
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:02,311
I'm not gonna be the one
doing these things, Eric.

305
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,612
You are.

306
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,482
What?

307
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,284
No! I...

308
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:11,654
That's just... weird.

309
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,656
It's not.

310
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,114
It's not weird.

311
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,464
Help me complete this list,

312
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,666
and I will make
sure you graduate.

313
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,602
No! You know what?
This is blackmail!

314
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,171
I'll just go talk to
Principal Cameron.

315
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,773
You know, fine, fine. Talk
to Principal Cameron.

316
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,308
I'm sure he'll be very
interested to know

317
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,410
that you didn't take
your Humanities class.

318
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,012
If I tell him what you just
said to me, you'll be fired.

319
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,938
And you will graduate
at Christmas.

320
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,300
You guys are here.

321
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,802
Somebody... die?

322
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,137
Mm! We're celebrating.

323
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,472
Celebrating what?

324
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,542
Our divorce papers
were final today.

325
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,644
What does that mean?

326
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:12,381
Is one of you guys
gonna move out?

327
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,483
No. Of course not!

328
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,653
[laughs] What would people say?

329
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:21,156
Dad, are you okay?

330
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,158
- Pass the vegetables.
- Why don't you hurry up now

331
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,294
'cause we're gonna be
late for the benefit.

332
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,297
Can I talk to you
guys about something?

333
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,399
Well, sweetheart, I'm
sorry, we gotta get going.

334
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:31,667
We're gonna meet the mayor.

335
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,002
Just hold on for one
second, please.

336
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,238
Okay.

337
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,674
What if someone I knew
was getting blackmailed?

338
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,576
Blackmailed how?

339
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,378
Well, there's this
kid at my school,

340
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:45,348
and he's not gonna
be able to graduate

341
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,716
if he doesn't do something
for someone else.

342
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,485
Something sexual?

343
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:53,255
What? No! Of course not.

344
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,223
- Oh, I hope not.
- All right, honey.

345
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,893
You know what I would do is
I would tell him to do it.

346
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,562
Okay? It's a long
road otherwise.

347
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,530
Trust me. I've been down it.

348
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,232
Who's this kid? Do
I know his mother?

349
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,669
No, you don't know him.

350
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:09,405
Okay, well, then stop
stressing me out.

351
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,106
I gotta get dressed.

352
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,342
You have to get dressed too.

353
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,910
I need a Xanax.

354
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,104
Yeah, you and me both.

355
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,052
Okay. Do you guys
wanna hear this?

356
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,254
You totally wanna hear this.
You can't wait to hear this.

357
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,923
So I was talking to Felicia,

358
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,925
who's close with Shauna, who
overheard some girl say

359
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,727
that the reason that
April broke up with you

360
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,429
is because you made out
with another girl.

361
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,030
Wow. Right?

362
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,433
Trent, The only thing
I heard about you

363
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,068
was that you made out with two
freshman girls on Friday night.

364
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,037
It was three.

365
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,439
Exactly. But no worries.

366
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,940
I talked to Tawnie
down at the blog,

367
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,875
and she said she'll
see what she can do.

368
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,444
Oh, and there was
one more thing.

369
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,713
Only 14 people mentioned my
hair on the A-List today.

370
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,080
[beep]

371
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,984
Well, 15. But still, rude.

372
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,921
Hannah, you do have
beautiful hair, however...

373
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,590
I sense that you have some
deep-rooted insecurities,

374
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,092
therefore you like to
emphasize superficial things

375
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,628
in fear that people might notice

376
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,130
you aren't as perfect
as you look.

377
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:12,134
Oh, you think I have
beautiful hair?

378
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,169
Hannah, what if I was to do
something out of the ordinary,

379
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:18,006
like join the Math Club or the
school musical or something?

380
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,942
So you wanna do the musical?
Why?

381
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:23,111
Well, maybe not the musical,
but something like that.

382
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,680
You know, we have two
more months of school.

383
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:27,950
What if I was to try
some new stuff?

384
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,985
How would that look?

385
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,820
It would definitely affect
your number on the list.

386
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,355
Speaking of which, we have
to make an announcement.

387
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,157
Announcement?

388
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,426
Everyone's tweeting about
college, blogging about college,

389
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,127
they're blogging about
tweeting about college.

390
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,096
I'm weighing my options.

391
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,633
You don't have time for that.
Everybody is dying to know.

392
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,503
It's like it goes in the
top, to the left...

393
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,438
Hey, Eric, what school
are you going to?

394
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,706
On the left, dude, like...

395
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,040
Eric, can I get a
quote for the blog?

396
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,108
Yeah, for what?

397
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,478
You're funny. College.

398
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:57,546
I don't wanna keep
anyone in the dark.

399
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,548
I just... I don't know
where I wanna go.

400
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:03,118
Any comment on the fact that
your ex is attending Pressman?

401
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:06,012
Told ya. Everyone's
dying to know.

402
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,024
Who's that guy?

403
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,526
Oh, that's Peter Craig.

404
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,227
He has two first names?

405
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,796
He's so sweet.

406
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,131
It's true. It's
like he's not real.

407
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,000
I can't find any dirt on him.

408
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,802
Oh, he's also super smart.

409
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,704
I heard he got a full
ride to Berkeley.

410
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:23,038
Bet he goes to Poetry Club.

411
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,139
Okay, are they dating?

412
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,541
He's going to Berkeley.

413
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,742
That's 3,000 miles
from New York.

414
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,243
It would never work out.

415
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,179
But there will be a Peter
Craig at Pressman.

416
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,215
There's one at every school.

417
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,083
I'm going to Pressman.

418
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,384
What?

419
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,420
Yeah.

420
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,490
If there's gonna be a Peter
Craig at Pressman University,

421
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,592
then his name's gonna
be Eric Schultz.

422
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:46,352
Uh, what?

423
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,932
Okay.

424
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,567
Let's do your list.

425
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,201
But in return,

426
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,671
you better write me the
best damn recommendation

427
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,006
to Pressman University
this world has ever seen.

428
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,341
Okay.

429
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,733
How do we do this?

430
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:06,381
There are five pieces
of paper in here.

431
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:09,051
- Five things to do.
- Okay.

432
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:12,120
But I get to tag along
for everything.

433
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,089
- What?
- Oh, come on!

434
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,892
What fun would it be if I didn't
get to participate, right?

435
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,393
We are gonna see so
much of each other.

436
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:21,296
It is gonna be super awesome.

437
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,557
That's not really
how I would put it.

438
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,608
[scoffs] Okay, well, Trent
was our quarterback, so...

439
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,076
Yes!

440
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,746
- I have to date Trent?
- Mm-hmm.

441
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,247
Well, can't I just
date a girl jock?

442
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,584
Oh, you are so silly.
I am not a lesbian.

443
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:44,620
But you're not the one
going on the date, so...

444
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:48,323
Oh, you kids are at that
experimental age, right?

445
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,225
All right, whatever. It's Trent.
We'll just hang out.

446
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,960
- No. It's a date.
- Whatever.

447
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,853
- It's a date.
- Fine. It's a date.

448
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,566
With Trent.

449
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,134
Yeah, I'm not wearing
a tie to school

450
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,436
because this isn't
prep school, okay?

451
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,172
Like, why am I in trouble?
I shouldn't be in trouble.

452
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,174
- I was just in the bathroom.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

453
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,311
You're not in trouble.
We're just bros.

454
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:11,647
We're guys hanging out. We're
doing guy stuff right now.

455
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,681
You're not in trouble.

456
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,082
But you're the principal.

457
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,084
That's me. Principal Bro.

458
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,986
Yeah, and so as the principal,

459
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,855
I'm saying you're
not in trouble.

460
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,691
What I really wanna know is how
that party was over at Joe's.

461
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:23,792
I heard it was crazy.

462
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,427
- It was cool.
- Yeah.

463
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,462
- Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
- I'll bet it was.

464
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,297
Wait. Were you there?

465
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:34,436
No. No, I had another
cool thing I was doing.

466
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,938
But listen, if you guys
ever need anything,

467
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:39,608
and I mean anything,
beer, whatever,

468
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,844
you let me know, I'm your guy.

469
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:43,478
- Beer?
- That's right.

470
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,347
- Anything.
- Um...

471
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,073
I mean, what?

472
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:53,188
Hey, um, I need your advice.

473
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,456
Yeah?

474
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,491
It's for a friend. He...

475
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,461
needs to ask a guy
out on a date.

476
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,664
Is he gay?

477
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:03,999
I know of an insane
coming-out group.

478
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,801
No, he's not gay.

479
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,470
It would be really open-minded
of me if I had a gay friend.

480
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:13,508
Okay, well, I'm sorry to burst
your fantasy, but he's straight.

481
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:17,512
You're saying that he's asking
a guy out, but he's not gay?

482
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,581
Yes.

483
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:22,208
And you say Poetry
Club is weird.

484
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,055
The Poetry Club is weird.

485
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,556
I didn't say that.
Did I say that?

486
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,325
Hey, you should get
to class, all right?

487
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,860
Keep it low. Keep it high.

488
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,528
Don't get high...
unless it's with me.

489
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:36,055
Just kidding. Not really. Okay.

490
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:41,937
Principal Cameron
is a strange dude.

491
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:45,173
Yeah. Definitely.

492
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:50,045
Hey, Trent, we haven't really
hung out, just us, in a while.

493
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,248
Well, yeah. You and April
are always together.

494
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:58,721
Well, uh, no, we broke
up three months ago.

495
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:02,057
No way, man.

496
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:05,593
Trent, we have talked
about this ten times.

497
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,463
[laughs] That's funny.

498
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,699
Yeah, um...

499
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:14,970
Anyway, I was just
gonna ask if, uh...

500
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,739
Do you wanna go on a date?

501
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:19,074
Yeah! For sure!

502
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,608
Wait, what?

503
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,111
A... A date.

504
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,647
No, but I'm not gay.

505
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:27,606
Neither am I.

506
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,486
You're joking, right?

507
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,789
Look, I'm not joking, but
it's not a big deal.

508
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:37,259
Dude, we're bros.

509
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:40,395
We can't be... homos.

510
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,764
That's like illegal.

511
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,489
Trent...

512
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,426
just trust me.

513
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,283
[door opens, closes]

514
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:04,853
My presentation is on the
Texas governor race of 1933

515
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,822
between Abraham Nixon
and George Kennedy.

516
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,423
Kennedy was the...

517
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,258
That's not even
an election year.

518
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,028
Those are not even real people.

519
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:15,363
Everybody loved Kennedy,

520
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,265
but then he started
acting kind of strange.

521
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,967
He stopped bathing regularly,

522
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:22,270
and he started wearing clothing
that was super confusing.

523
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,806
Voters went along with
it for a little while,

524
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,942
but Nixon, well, he was
a sneaky little bitch.

525
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,011
Trent.

526
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:31,980
Hey. I need...

527
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,682
I don't think he wants
to talk to you.

528
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,452
Okay, just give him this.

529
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,578
Done and done.

530
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:50,465
So I don't actually have
a presentation prepared,

531
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,068
but this morning
I woke up and...

532
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,904
I mean, look at my hair.
It's awesome, right?

533
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,406
- I spent like...
- So it's not confirmed yet,

534
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,743
but there's an almost-rumor
that you asked Trent out.

535
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:02,978
You asked Trent out?

536
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:06,581
What? No.

537
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,650
Hannah, can you kill this?

538
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,986
Maybe for a little while,
but this almost-rumor

539
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,088
will become a quiet
rumor by tonight

540
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,656
and will become an
official full-blown rumor

541
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,925
by tomorrow morning for sure.

542
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,194
Wait. Are you just doing
this to get attention?

543
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:21,696
Of course not.

544
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,166
Hannah, just talk to me, okay?
What are my options here?

545
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,535
You have no options. You
can't ask Trent out.

546
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,604
I'm not gonna ask
Trent out on a date!

547
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,773
Okay.

548
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:34,200
Eric asked Trent out on a date?

549
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:44,119
[message tones chiming]

550
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,855
I didn't... Who's Trent?

551
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:48,280
[chiming continues]

552
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,238
Why is everybody
acting so weird?

553
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,473
They think it's really cool
that you're so open-minded.

554
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,942
They think it's cool

555
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,643
that I wanted to go
on a date with Trent?

556
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,279
It is cool. You're showing
it doesn't matter.

557
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,215
You know who else would
think it's cool?

558
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,716
Poetry Club.

559
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,484
Please, Coach, extra credit?

560
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,320
I don't even know what to do.

561
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:19,654
I don't either, okay?

562
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,123
But you better come
up with something

563
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:22,790
because I said extra credit,

564
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,250
and you're gonna do it.

565
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,428
I'll see you later.

566
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:29,831
Hey, uh, Mr. Bruner?

567
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,968
What do you want?
You don't matter.

568
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,802
You didn't even play football.

569
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,438
Okay, fair enough.

570
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:39,274
But for his extra credit,

571
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,700
what if he went on
a date with a guy?

572
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,481
I'm gonna pretend this
conversation didn't happen.

573
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,084
No, I'm serious.
I'll even volunteer.

574
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:51,419
I think that's
such a great idea.

575
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,379
What is a great idea?

576
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,791
The extra credit.

577
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,027
The what?

578
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,452
This is sociology, right?

579
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:07,793
Two straight high school
boys going on a date.

580
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:17,812
[laughs]

581
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:21,140
Coach, please don't make me
go on a date with a guy!

582
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,556
No one knows we're here, right?

583
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,559
Don't worry. No one
knows we're here.

584
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,561
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

585
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,421
Oh, I hear ya, man.

586
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:40,468
"Eric, you look
really cute tonight."

587
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:44,639
"You look amazing too.

588
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:49,044
You're one of the best-looking
guys I've ever seen.

589
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:52,047
I really like it when you
do your hair like that."

590
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,482
Um... [clears throat]

591
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,109
"So what was it you
wanted to tell me?"

592
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,723
"We've known each
other for a while,

593
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:05,217
but I've never had the chance
to tell you how I feel."

594
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,922
"H-How do you feel?"

595
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,402
I need to take a shit.

596
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,129
No.

597
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:23,878
Okay, buck up, mister! You
need more passion here.

598
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:27,582
I'm trying. It's just
so freaking weird.

599
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,617
No, it's not. I
need more passion.

600
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,619
You have to do this. Come on.

601
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,921
Okay, um...

602
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:38,693
I am the man of your dreams.
Right?

603
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,096
Come on, passion.

604
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,697
Just pump it up! Feel it.

605
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:44,132
- Okay.
- Feel it!

606
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:46,068
Okay. I will feel it.

607
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:48,660
Okay. Cool. Good talk.

608
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,480
I was worried for a second.
I'm a little nervous.

609
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:01,983
Are you a little nervous?
Because I'm sweating.

610
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,220
Oh, God. It's like
so hot in here.

611
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:08,956
Can you please just calm down?

612
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,726
Thank you. I've got this.

613
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,851
Okay.

614
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
Okay.

615
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,307
Can we lose the scripts, man?

616
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:27,008
- No.
- Yeah.

617
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,577
Let's just have a conversation.

618
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:33,038
We can, um, we can tell
each other how we feel.

619
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,119
All right.

620
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:39,521
So how do you feel?

621
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:45,151
Uh, I think you're
a really cool guy.

622
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,697
You have really nice eyes.

623
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:53,268
Yeah, dude, there we go.
We're killing it right now.

624
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:56,104
No, I'm serious.

625
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,106
They're really kind of pretty.

626
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,443
Um...

627
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,302
Okay.

628
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:09,016
Have you ever thought about...

629
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,376
dating a guy?

630
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:13,988
No.

631
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,824
I never had either.

632
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,527
I mean, we're dudes.

633
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,997
Dudes date chicks, right?

634
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:27,502
- Right.
- But then you got me thinking.

635
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:30,505
And, well...

636
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:31,697
why not?

637
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:36,178
Um...

638
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:39,214
Trent...

639
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:42,374
I'm not actually
trying to date you.

640
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,045
It's fine.

641
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:55,830
This may be the first
date I've ever been on

642
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:59,267
where I'm able to be myself.

643
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:03,562
And for a guy like me,
that's a big step.

644
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:09,076
I just wanna say thank you.

645
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:15,617
I'm really, really
glad you asked me out.

646
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,709
Sure. You're welcome, dude.

647
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,782
Thank you.

648
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,564
Was that the guidance counselor?

649
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,399
Eric, is this a real
homosexual encounter,

650
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,368
or are you just proving a point
that everybody's created equal?

651
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,136
Uh, yeah.

652
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,472
Trent's our star soccer player.

653
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:41,909
And if he doesn't play,
then we don't win, right?

654
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,579
This date was just an extra
credit assignment for sociology,

655
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,648
so that he could play in
the game this weekend.

656
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,384
- Oh, okay.
- All right.

657
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:52,411
- Yeah, yeah.
- Simple, okay.

658
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,478
Sylvia, what are you doing here?

659
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,813
Eric!

660
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,915
We have some planning to do.

661
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,685
The date was a major
success party.

662
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:28,290
Um, okay, well, can we
talk about this at school?

663
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,624
Are your parents home?

664
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,826
What are they like?

665
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,129
Why do you wanna know
about my parents?

666
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:36,798
I bet they're on a
date right now.

667
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:39,000
I bet it's a really, really
beautiful restaurant

668
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:42,937
with candles and...

669
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,196
steak.

670
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,548
Anyhoo, who's ready
for some more fun?

671
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,216
Yay!

672
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,218
Look, don't I get some time off,

673
00:37:57,242 --> 00:38:00,322
like a paid vacation
or something?

674
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:02,990
You're sitting on the couch
playing guitar alone.

675
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,560
That does not sound like a
very fun vacation to me.

676
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,862
Right.

677
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,231
Besides, I thought you
wanted to get this over with

678
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,534
as quickly as possible.

679
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:14,569
No. Yeah, I do.

680
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:15,637
All right, here, let me see.

681
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:16,928
Okay.

682
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,333
What'd ya get?

683
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:26,414
Hey, stranger! No whip.

684
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:29,984
Thanks. Since when are
you up this early?

685
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,820
Since I decided to try
out for cheerleading.

686
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,423
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

687
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,224
I won't let you on the team.

688
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,060
That's not very April of you.

689
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,496
Anyone who wants to try
out should be able to.

690
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,900
Eric Schultz does not cheer.
Why are you doing this?

691
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,570
I don't know. I mean, why not?

692
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:50,572
We only have two months
of school left anyway.

693
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:52,273
So it's a joke?

694
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:54,542
You know, the girls on the
team have put years into this.

695
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,277
Look, maybe if I do this,

696
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,346
it'll show other guys
that cheerleading's cool.

697
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,781
[phone chimes]

698
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:03,117
Maybe they'll remember
this next year.

699
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,019
So you're not just doing
this for attention?

700
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,789
No. Look, I really...

701
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,615
I wanna make a point.

702
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,795
Fine. Tryouts are
this afternoon.

703
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:16,263
HANNAH: But you'll be the
only guy at our school.

704
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,966
Who cares if I'm the
only guy on the team?

705
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,468
Guys don't cheer.

706
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,470
It's always been that
way at our school.

707
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,038
It's pretty old school, Hannah.

708
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:27,041
Is, uh... Is it cool
to be a cheerleader?

709
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,610
I mean, I've always
wanted to be one,

710
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,545
but I didn't know it was cool.

711
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:33,114
Yeah. I mean, I'm doing it.

712
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:36,651
Don't let Eric misinform you.
It's not okay, ever.

713
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:38,486
Are you thinking
about trying out?

714
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,921
Why would I wanna
be a cheerleader?

715
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,123
That kind of label
sticks with you forever.

716
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,825
I was talking to him.

717
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,227
Yeah. I'm going to try out.

718
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,629
That's awesome, dude.

719
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:48,896
Well, you're gonna
be hanging out

720
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,264
with the hottest
girls in school.

721
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:53,468
Oh, and the skirts.

722
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:54,860
Short skirts.

723
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,581
Hey, Eric, we need to start.

724
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:08,607
All right, okay, coming!

725
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,622
Fits pretty well, right?

726
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:18,025
If you make the team, we'll
give you guys uniforms.

727
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,452
You know what? I kinda like it.

728
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:36,110
Hey, guys, why don't you
watch from over there first?

729
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,345
Oh. You don't think
I can hack it?

730
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,815
I guarantee that you
can't do this cheer.

731
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,908
Okay.

732
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,294
Okay, so you've been
sidelined already?

733
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:56,688
Gimme a break. I just started.

734
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,368
You know, when I was young,

735
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,838
I used to go to all the
cheering practices,

736
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,907
and I would watch
all the routines,

737
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:10,144
and then I would go home,
and I would just...

738
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,680
I would do them all.

739
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,719
So do you know how
to do this stuff?

740
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,587
Yeah.

741
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:23,725
I mean, it's been years.

742
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:27,428
Okay, Eric, can you
please play attention

743
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:28,863
because technique is
really important,

744
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:30,364
otherwise somebody can get hurt.

745
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,666
Sorry.

746
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,092
This routine is
pretty simple though.

747
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,752
Yay.

748
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:08,594
Lakers!

749
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:15,142
Ow. Doesn't that hurt you?

750
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,912
After a while, your downstairs
really starts to callus over.

751
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:20,338
Oh, that is so hot.

752
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:27,922
Uh, I feel like cheerleading
is like 98% observation,

753
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:31,793
so I'm just gonna... I'm
gonna sit out one more time

754
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:33,728
- until I'm sure I've got it.
- Eric.

755
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:37,098
Gregory doesn't seem like he
has a problem with the cheer.

756
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:39,591
Yeah. He doesn't.

757
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,963
This is awesome!

758
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,266
Ah...

759
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:55,473
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God. Um...

760
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,478
I'm okay? I'm okay.

761
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:04,792
Eric.

762
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:07,361
Hey. Hey, man.

763
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,963
Dude, thank you.

764
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,332
That was awesome.

765
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:13,859
Yeah.

766
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,298
Gosh.

767
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:26,237
Are we like in trouble
or something?

768
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,717
No.

769
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,653
No, no, of course not.

770
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:35,723
I mean, I just, I mean, I
just came over to watch.

771
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:38,626
- You have an amazing routine.
- Obvi.

772
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,195
She's just, you know,
here to help us out.

773
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,731
How is the guidance
counselor a help?

774
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:47,068
Well, first of all,
she has a name, okay?

775
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:49,070
It's Sylvia.

776
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:55,342
And actually, she was captain
of the cheer team, right?

777
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,378
She got second place
at Nationals.

778
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:59,180
You did?

779
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,849
- Yes.
- That's so cool.

780
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,085
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

781
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:07,154
- Oh, she's so modest.
- I...

782
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:09,323
I would love to see your
routine from Nationals.

783
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:10,758
I bet it was amazing.

784
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:11,993
Hey, that's a great idea!

785
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:13,427
Why don't you show us a cheer?

786
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:15,362
Oh, 'cause that's really silly!

787
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,599
I haven't done it in years.
[laughs]

788
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:21,235
Oh, but, would you please
just show us something?

789
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,762
- That would be awesome.
- Yeah!

790
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:26,440
Hey.

791
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:28,700
You got this.

792
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:31,402
Okay.

793
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:36,474
Okay, um, I'm just gonna
take off my glasses.

794
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:40,287
- Girls?
- Whew!

795
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:41,622
Whoops!

796
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:43,081
Okay.

797
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,169
[clears throat]

798
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,548
All right.

799
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:10,584
Ready?

800
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:11,843
Okay.

801
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,960
Let's go, Lakers.

802
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:24,065
Let's go, Lakers.

803
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:26,834
Let's go, Lakers!

804
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,970
Let's go, Lakers!

805
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:31,662
Let's go, Lakers! Let's go!

806
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:51,125
[cheering]

807
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:54,528
[screaming]

808
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:57,832
[excited chatter]

809
00:45:57,856 --> 00:46:00,667
I know, right? I was... Okay!

810
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,536
Let's go, Lakers!

811
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,131
[chatter continues]

812
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:12,537
You don't quit, do you?

813
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,551
- Sylvia, wait up!
- Oh, hey, girls.

814
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,053
- What's up?
- Oh, you know, I don't know.

815
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:20,621
I have to get back
to work though.

816
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:21,889
I didn't know you and
Eric were friends.

817
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:24,058
He's like a little
brother to me.

818
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,993
Is he just as nice in real life?

819
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,494
What are you doing
later tonight?

820
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,297
I don't know. I have to
get back to the office.

821
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,366
We should hang out. Jimmy's
throwing a sick party tonight.

822
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,869
- Yeah, you should so go.
- Oh, wow. Okay, yeah, sick.

823
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,428
Okay, I don't know. Maybe. Bye.

824
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:40,665
Oh, my God.

825
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:46,713
Fuck yeah!

826
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,074
[doorbell ringing]

827
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:52,319
- Hey.
- Hi.

828
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:53,845
- Here, come on in.
- Okay.

829
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:01,195
Okay, are you ready
to go to the party?

830
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:03,497
I don't know. I don't know.

831
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,266
I don't know if... I
don't feel like...

832
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,767
I don't belong.

833
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,871
Hey, listen, the entire
cheerleading squad

834
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:11,438
is talking about how
excited they are

835
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:12,840
that you are going
to this party.

836
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:14,508
- Really?
- Yeah.

837
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:18,079
No. I'm a guidance counselor, Eric.
I can't.

838
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:19,546
This is so stupid and...

839
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,615
Okay, so, hey, use
it as an opportunity

840
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,886
to warn us about the dangers
of underage drinking.

841
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,753
Eric, I don't know.

842
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:29,190
Eric, were you the last
one to use my car?

843
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:31,216
It's filthy.

844
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:34,595
I'm sorry.

845
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,730
Who's this?

846
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:40,067
This is my guidance counselor.

847
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:43,204
We were just talking
about college stuff.

848
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:46,874
Shouldn't she be talking
about that in school?

849
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:49,576
This seems really inappropriate.

850
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,837
Um, no, it's not a big deal.

851
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,586
I'm sorry. You look...

852
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,990
What did you say your name was?

853
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:04,425
Sylvia.

854
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,793
- Sylvia?
- Yeah.

855
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,795
I think you should go.

856
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,924
Any school-related subjects can
be handled in your office.

857
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:17,071
I'm sorry.

858
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:20,674
Yes, you're abs... You're...
I'm... I'm gonna go.

859
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:24,645
And, Eric, next time you
wanna invite someone over,

860
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:27,114
I think you should clear
it with me first.

861
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,183
I didn't think you would care.

862
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:31,009
I care.

863
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:34,355
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna...

864
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:37,324
I just wanna tell you that
this is not Eric's fault.

865
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:40,127
I told him that I could
come over, and it's not...

866
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,964
Oh, you know what?

867
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:46,133
I wasn't even talking
to you, so...

868
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,435
- Why are you being rude to her?
- You know what?

869
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:51,872
I don't even have time for this
discussion right now. I'm late.

870
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:53,398
We'll discuss this later.

871
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:57,568
[door closes]

872
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,487
I don't really feel like
going to a party anymore.

873
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:10,381
I don't really feel
like going either.

874
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:17,064
Thank you for trying or...

875
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:18,756
something.

876
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:25,997
Hey, you wanna see a picture
of my mom with braces?

877
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,513
What the eff?

878
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:49,997
Oh, hey, Lacey, did you
talk to April last night?

879
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,732
Yeah.

880
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:53,267
How'd it go? Does she, um...

881
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,835
she wanna get back together?

882
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:56,937
I don't know.

883
00:49:56,961 --> 00:50:00,074
You don't know if...

884
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:03,244
Well, okay. The whole cheering thing?
I mean, really?

885
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:06,347
She might've bought it,
but I certainly didn't.

886
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:09,550
I didn't even make the squad.

887
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,118
Yeah, but then why did
you even try out?

888
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:13,754
And why did you go on
a date with Trent?

889
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,756
Look, I only did that
so he could play.

890
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,791
April is my friend.

891
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:20,094
I just... I can't
in good conscience

892
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:22,387
try getting you back together
if you're playing games.

893
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:26,133
Okay. Can I tell you something?

894
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:29,236
Eric, you know you can trust me.

895
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,039
I have to do this list.

896
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,631
What do you mean, list?

897
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,989
Oh, hey, April's
up to number two.

898
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:51,458
Whatever. The only
list that matters

899
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,394
is the last week of school.

900
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:54,728
Whoever's number
one on that list

901
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:56,463
will be our inevitable V.I.P.

902
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:58,399
That's a good point.

903
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:01,168
A lot can change
between now and then.

904
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:03,737
I could do a
headline about Eric.

905
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,496
Oh, or what about Sylvia?

906
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:08,775
Save that.

907
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,536
I have a feeling a much
bigger story is brewing.

908
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:17,418
It's interesting how close Eric
and Lacey seem to be, isn't it?

909
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,686
Where's Jimmy?

910
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,455
I think he's sick today.

911
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:23,290
Have they been spending
a lot of time together?

912
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:26,593
- No idea.
- Well, do you think...

913
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:31,665
I could never suggest that. I
mean, they're my best friends.

914
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:35,369
Well, they may be your friends,
but that looks suspicious.

915
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:38,272
I hate to admit it, but I
guess you just can't argue

916
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:40,798
with the cold, hard facts.

917
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:53,654
I had a feeling
something was up.

918
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,213
Yeah. It sucks.

919
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:58,692
Eric! Lacey.

920
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:01,061
I have to talk to you.

921
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:04,198
Okay. I should get to class,
but I'll see you later.

922
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:05,823
Okay, bye.

923
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,336
You here to bring
me my next task?

924
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,205
I just read something
on the school blog.

925
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,140
Okay. What was it?

926
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:16,410
You and Lacey are sneaking
around behind Jimmy's back.

927
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:17,644
- What?
- What?

928
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:18,712
I know!

929
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,104
Pig.

930
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:23,317
Okay, you know what?

931
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,486
You cannot let people think that
you're cheating with Lacey.

932
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,354
This is not fair!

933
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:30,924
Okay, well, I'm not gonna
stop hanging out with Lacey.

934
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:36,062
Okay, well, then I came up
with a solution, possibly.

935
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,165
Why don't you just
pick out of the hat,

936
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:41,435
and maybe it will take people's
minds off it for a little bit.

937
00:52:41,459 --> 00:52:44,505
- Okay.
- Pick it up.

938
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:46,440
Mm-hmm. Yup. Mm-hmm.

939
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:47,841
- You know what?
- What?

940
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:49,576
- This actually might help.
- I know.

941
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,736
That's what I'm here for.

942
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,082
You gotta give him
a chance, Coach.

943
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:58,084
I have always wanted
to play soccer, sir.

944
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,920
And I promise I will
not let you down.

945
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:01,355
Oh, stop your whining.

946
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:02,923
You sound like a little bitch.

947
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,025
He's Eric. I mean,
he'll be a natural.

948
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:07,294
He's good at everything.

949
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,986
He's just incredible.

950
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:14,601
He's good at everything, huh?
You're a natural?

951
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,570
I... I'm, I don't know.

952
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:19,473
Oh, fine. First string.

953
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:21,275
First string?

954
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:23,710
You said he's a natural. He's
good at everything, right?

955
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:26,547
I more meant I could
like ease into it.

956
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:29,440
It's too late. I
made my decision.

957
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,722
Okay, Eric, you better not screw
this up for us, okay, bud?

958
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,724
Of course. Hey,
hey, I can do this.

959
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:38,949
Oh, and, boys...

960
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,525
we lose a single game, and
I will kill you both.

961
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:05,018
Hey, come on, dude!
What's your problem?

962
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,853
Why are these guys
being such dicks?

963
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:08,489
I know. It's weird.

964
00:54:08,513 --> 00:54:11,825
I mean, you're attractive
and super rich.

965
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,927
The essentials to life.

966
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,330
Eric, you're not
a soccer player.

967
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:18,499
It would be different if you
were actually good at soccer,

968
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:21,134
but if you fail
at a sport, well,

969
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:23,060
you're going to be
a laughingstock.

970
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,941
What's the big deal? I
mean, it's just a game.

971
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,677
- It's not just a game.
- It's not just a game.

972
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:33,213
Eric, can I get a
quote for the blog?

973
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:36,850
Hey! You are making up
rumors about me and Lacey.

974
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:39,620
I don't make up the news.
I just report it.

975
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:41,688
What have I ever done to you?

976
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:43,290
I'm just doing my job.

977
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:45,350
No, give it to me! Don't!

978
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:48,562
You're an asshole.

979
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:51,465
Look, write whatever
you want, okay?

980
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,724
No one's gonna
believe you anyways.

981
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:00,541
Picking a fight with the media.

982
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:02,199
Nice move.

983
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,846
The decline of former
A-Lister Eric Schultz

984
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,414
took another dive last night

985
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:09,583
when it was confirmed
by multiple sources

986
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:12,252
that he was, in fact, a loser

987
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,488
and that he was cheating
on April Adamson

988
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:16,923
with his best friend's
girlfriend, Lacey Parish,

989
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:17,991
all of last year.

990
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,593

00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:47,921
You dropped down to number 12.

998
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,556
Oh, no, the world is over.

999
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,091
I have been working my ass off

1000
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:52,859
trying to get this
under control.

1001
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,861
Do you want these
rumors to end, Eric?

1002
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:56,363
Quit soccer,

1003
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:57,964
lay low on your
friendship with Lacey...

1004
00:55:57,988 --> 00:55:59,265
No offense, doll...

1005
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,934
And start being you again.

1006
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:04,538
Ignore her. She's talking about
superficial nothingness.

1007
00:56:04,562 --> 00:56:08,274
How does it feel to be so
effing unpopular, Eric?

1008
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,911
Look, I'm not unpopular.
I'm number 12.

1009
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:12,746
I'm just curious.

1010
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,815
I've obviously just never
known what it feels like

1011
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,141
to be outside of the top ten.

1012
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,555
All right, what are we gonna
do about these rumors?

1013
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:24,791
Are you okay? I know
this must kill you.

1014
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,292
What, because you think
I can't handle it?

1015
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,961
I'm gonna bounce back. I just...

1016
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:31,064
Eric, there's a lot more to
you than what number you are

1017
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:33,233
on some stupid list.

1018
00:56:33,257 --> 00:56:35,493
Okay, thanks.

1019
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:38,405
It's a good thing.

1020
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,431
What's up?

1021
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:46,913
That doesn't mean anything.

Look, about this
whole Lacey thing...

I don't believe it anyway.

1029
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:09,703
Now everybody hates me.

1030
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:11,037
Have you talked to Jimmy yet?

1031
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:12,773
I mean, I dropped
down on the A-List

1032
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:14,374

that I didn't even do.

Have you even talked to him?

1035
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:21,014
No.

1036
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:23,016
No, but I will.

1037
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,152
There's so much going on now.
I don't have time to talk...

1038
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,079
- I don't even know why I bother.
- What are you talking about?

1039
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:34,394
You don't even care
about your best friend.

1040
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:36,386

Hey, I just tried to talk to...

1048
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,397
She's not gonna waste her
time on some douchebag.

1049
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,233
Yeah, douchebag.

1050

just leave me alone?

1051
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:16,102
You're such a loser.

1052
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,771
Yeah, loser.

1053
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:18,905
And you're a dick.

1054
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:21,675
- Yeah, dick.
- Dude!

1055
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:24,578
He was all, "I'm Eric Schultz,
and I can do what I want."

1056
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:26,847
- And he shoved me.
- Whoa.

1057
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:29,616
Yeah. He didn't
even play football.

1058
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,185
Then Eric just up and jacked
him right in the face.

1059
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:33,386
No!

1060
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,121
No?

1061
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:36,690
Yes?

1062
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:38,725
Um... What?

1063
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:41,461
So obviously Eric needs
psychological help.

1064
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:43,964
Like rehab? I'm so jealous.

1065
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:46,591
Ew. Rehab is like so 2005.

1066
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,304
Oh.

1067
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:53,831
Hey, ladies.

1068
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,109
You look gorgi.

1069
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:58,078
She's like so sweet.

1070
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:00,213
Are you guys getting excited
about the awards show?

1071
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:03,049
I wonder who is gonna
be V.I.P., right?

1072
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:06,486
I don't know. Hannah
has really great hair.

1073
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:08,722
Oh, thanks, doll!

1074
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:11,224
Yeah, but she's like
such a fake bitch.

1075
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:15,061
- Yeah.
- I heard that, you chubby slut!

1076
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:16,253
Okay.

1077
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,133
Have you been
checking the A-List?

1078
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:21,568
That's what we came to tell you.

1079
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:22,603
What?

1080
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:23,670
You're on the list!

1081
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,606
[giggling]

1082
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,197
What?

1083
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:33,647
Wait! [screams] Wait, hold on!

1084
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:37,417
But I'm a faculty member. That's
not even possible, is it?

1085
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:38,484
Is it?

1086
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:39,686
Oh, my God.

1087
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,855
Okay.

1088
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,690
Okay.

1089
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:45,525
Oh, yeah, okay.

1090
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:48,795
I'm number 52. Is that good?

1091
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:50,697
You're the only faculty
member on the list.

1092
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:52,532
- It's amazing.
- It is!

1093
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:55,101
Oh, what number is Eric?

1094
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,370
Eric's not on the list anymore.

1095
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:58,863
Oh.

1096
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:03,209
Dude, she has no class.

1097
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:06,212
Hey, just, don't be afraid
to get hurt out there.

1098
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:08,314
Dude, I'm not afraid.

1099
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:11,718
I've heard about your
mental breakdowns lately.

1100
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:13,854
I just don't wanna
see you get hurt.

1101
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:16,156
I'm fine, dude.

1102
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,491
I got this.

1103
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:23,697
Dude, I care about you.

1104
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:27,033
A lot.

1105
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,669
Dude, you have
really nice calves.

1106
01:00:28,693 --> 01:00:31,304
Uh, what?

1107
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:33,139
Trent!

1108
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:35,976
Do not use your hands
on the soccer field!

1109
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,179
Especially not to
touch your teammate.

1110
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:40,570
[whistle blows]

1111
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,387
What are we doing here?

1112
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:50,090
Aren't you curious to see
if he's good or not?

1113
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,058
He better be. I skipped
a mani for this.

1114
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,784
Oh, God, he's gonna
be an all-star.

1115
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:01,858
[blows whistle]

1116
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:10,010
All right, back it up. Back it up.
Get it around.

1117
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:12,302
Nice, Rizzola!

1118
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,625
Watch it.

1119
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:26,784
Come on.

1120
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:32,289
Okay, yeah, that,
that, that sucked.

1121
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:39,997
Okay, Eric, here it comes!
Here it comes!

1122
01:01:43,768 --> 01:01:45,135
And there it goes.

1123
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:50,383
I'm gonna kill you.

1124
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,085
I'm gonna kill... I'm
gonna kill myself.

1125
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:53,787
I'm gonna kill you, then myself.

1126
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,746
Why is he just standing there?

1127
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:58,925
You can do it, Eric!

1128
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,251
He's so over.

1129
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:06,991
Get the ball!

1130
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,296
Get the ball!

1131
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:16,867
Kick the ball!

1132
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:24,974
Oh.

1133
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:31,091
Owwww!

1134
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:33,550
Hey, hey, you all right?

1135
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,763
Oh, my...

1136
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,631
Okay. All right.

1137
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:39,824
It's not that bad.

1138
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,228
It's not that bad.

1139
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:04,915
Hi.

1140
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:11,064
I'm trying to explain to
him that it was all a lie.

1141
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,157
Jimmy, why don't you
believe me, dude?

1142
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:17,370
He's fragile.

1143
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,139
Great.

1144
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:21,341
So, when are you done
with Sylvia's list?

1145
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:23,343
I have two things left.

1146
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:25,569
Be careful.

1147
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:30,851
I have a proposition for you.

1148
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:32,218
What's that?

1149
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:33,920
Well, I know how everyone
is treating you,

1150
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:36,156
and it's making me feel awful.

1151
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,490
What do we do?

1152
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:39,159
There's a few options.

1153
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:40,927
I can think of one in particular

1154
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:43,420
that might be
extremely effective.

1155
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,433
You want me to take you to
the Student Choice Awards.

1156
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:49,335
- How'd you guess?
- I told you.

1157
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,537
I'm just as clever as you are.

1158
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,506
What do you say?

1159
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,208
I don't know.

1160
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:57,010
I mean, do you really
think it would help?

1161
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:59,045
This could save you.

1162
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:00,204
You're falling fast.

1163
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:04,584
I'm not falling.

1164
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:07,187
Eric, is it true that
you're starving yourself?

1165
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:09,189
Oh, and what drove you to
hit your best friend Jimmy?

1166
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:11,191
Also, any comment on
your strange obsession

1167
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,126
with the guidance counselor?

1168
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,651
Eric!

1169
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:24,061
Jimmy.

1170
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:27,131
Look, I'm sorry, dude.

1171
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:34,480
That's it?

1172
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:36,883
Yeah.

1173
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:39,953
It sucks having you mad
at me, and Lacey and I,

1174
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:41,387
we would never try to...

1175
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:43,823
I know you guys
didn't do anything.

1176
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:45,491
You do?

1177
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:48,852
Well, then why are you mad?

1178
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:51,564
I'm sorry.

1179
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,499
Could you tell Eric
he's being a hypocrite?

1180
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:55,635
Eric, you're being a hypocrite.

1181
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:58,905
Yeah, I heard. Will
you tell Jimmy...

1182
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,240
that I'm sorry?

1183
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:01,841
I don't know what
else I can say.

1184
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:03,743
You don't even know what
you're sorry about.

1185
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:05,912
Well, then tell me.

1186
01:05:05,936 --> 01:05:09,315
You always made me feel really
stupid for writing poetry,

1187
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,518
and then here you go doing
all this other crazy shit.

1188
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:14,154
You do whatever you want.

1189
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:15,922
Yeah, but look how it
turned out for me, man.

1190
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,658
I mean, I was just
trying to protect you.

[book slams]

1192
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:21,051
Shh.

1193
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,464
At least you got a try.

1194
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:26,532
At least you got to
live out your fantasy.

1195
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:29,202
Trust me, I am not
living out my fantasy.

1196
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,371
Then what are you doing?

Oh, hey, kiddo.

1200
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,188
What's wrong?

1201
01:05:48,212 --> 01:05:50,023
You know what's wrong.

1202
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:51,724
Oh.

1203
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:53,526
Oh, yeah, yes.

1204

1205
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:56,462
None of this would've happened

1206
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:58,198
if I wouldn't have
done your stupid list.

1207
01:05:58,222 --> 01:06:00,200
No.

1208
01:06:00,224 --> 01:06:03,303
No, no, this has nothing
to do with the list.

1209
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:04,870
I'm done.

1210
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,072
I quit.

1211
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:07,240
You can't.

1212
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:09,642
I mean, um,

1213
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:13,879
we're almost through with it.

1214
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,406
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

1215
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:22,588
Don't you want to
go to Pressman?

1216
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,514
Did I get in?

1217
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:18,611
Can I go to the bathroom?

1219
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,606

are my daughters.

hell of a margarita.

hop in, have a bath?

Get your ass back here, Schultz!

1228
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,577
He's so desperate for attention.

1229
01:08:57,601 --> 01:08:59,903
What did I ever see in him?

1230
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:48,728
Hola, compadres.

1231
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:50,230
Un momento.

1232
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:53,089
Muy gigante cajones.

1233
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:59,138
I can explain.

1234
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:00,773
I don't wanna hear it.

1235
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:02,566
Hold it right there, Schultz!

1236
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:12,285
[gasps] I'm up to number 50.

1237
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:13,343
Yes!

1238
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:03,893
Daddy, what is that?

1239
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:17,006
So you're the naked kid.

1240
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,954
I couldn't reach either
of your parents.

1241
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:24,314
Do you know where they could be?

1242
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:31,230
Look, kid, I don't wanna
hold you here overnight.

1243
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:34,891
Is there anyone else I can call?

1244
01:11:50,574 --> 01:11:51,941
[door closes]

1245
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,248
Let's get you home.

1246
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:09,234
This is all my fault.

1247
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:12,338
No, no. It's...

1248
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:14,374
It's, uh...

1249
01:12:14,398 --> 01:12:15,932
It's not all your fault.

1250
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:22,348
I'm your guidance
counselor, Eric.

1251
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:27,119
I... guided you to jail.

1252
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:30,022
Well, you know what? I
didn't have to do this.

1253
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:35,861
I didn't have to do any of it.
I mean, I'm Eric Schultz.

1254
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,130
I can do whatever I want.

1255
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:40,232
So you don't hate me?

1256
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:43,126
You're the only one
who bailed me out.

1257
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:51,300
Thanks.

1258
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:57,783
You know, I, uh...

1259
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:02,121
I used to have a
crush on your dad

1260
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:04,123
when I was in high school.

1261
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:05,558
What?

1262
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:07,993
Yeah.

1263
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:09,562
Why?

1264
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:12,164
I don't know.

1265
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:16,092
I was a kid, and, uh...

1266
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:21,774
he was the only popular
guy who was...

1267
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:25,101
who was ever nice to me.

1268
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:30,349
Well, he doesn't
even talk to me.

1269
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:35,612
I don't even know who he is.

1270
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:42,151
I'm sure he's a good guy.

1271
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:50,169
Is that what this is all about?

1272
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:52,729
No, I just...

1273
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:02,448
I just wanted to know
what it would be like...

1274
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:05,374
to belong.

1275
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:11,290
And doing this list with you,

1276
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:13,859
I don't know, it made me feel...

1277
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:16,529
cool...

1278
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:17,754
complete.

1279
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:24,427
And now I just feel awful.

1280
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:39,852
Ten more seconds Every
lie leads to a lesson

1281
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:44,557
Every time you start to
question if you're wrong

1282
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:48,260
Everyone is wondering about you

1283
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:51,831
And hoping that you'll miss
them when they're gone

1284
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:54,390

What's going on?

1294
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:30,803
Miss Martin was just explaining
about this list deal

1295
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:32,037
between the two of you,

1296
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,439
and, I gotta say, not cool.

1297
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,909
I mean, it's not fair
for any faculty member

1298
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:38,477
to put any student
in any situation

1299
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,546
where they're gonna
be uncomfortable.

1300
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,114
Unless of course it's in a van,

1301
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:45,651
with a six pack of beer,
off school property.

1302
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:49,922
Um, the whole list, none
of that was her fault.

1303
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:51,724
I didn't think it was
a big deal either.

1304
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:54,126
In fact I loved the streaking.

1305
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,128
It's gonna be legendary.

1306
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:57,963
I don't even mind paying for the
therapy for my little girls

1307
01:15:57,987 --> 01:15:59,599
who saw the whole thing.

1308
01:15:59,623 --> 01:16:01,734
Okay, I'm sorry. Are
you firing her?

1309
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:04,436
The Board, bunch of sticklers.

1310
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,272
In fact, the head of the Board's
actually a guy named Stickle.

1311
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:11,243
I coerced an 18-year-old boy to
run naked through a high school.

1312
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:15,204
- That is a good point.
- I'm sorry, but she's lying.

1313
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:18,684
It was all my idea.

1314
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,485
Mr. Cameron, can we
have a minute please?

1315
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,646
- Yes, yes, you can.
- Thank you.

1316
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:28,427
Why are you doing this?
Let me take the blame.

1317
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:29,829
What I did was wrong,

1318
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:31,463
and there is no
getting around it.

1319
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:34,333
Okay, but everybody
hates me anyways.

1320
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:35,935
Everybody loves you.

1321
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:38,370
No, they don't.

1322
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:42,942
They loved me because the
stupid A-List told them to.

1323
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:45,878
How do you think you were
number one on that list

1324
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:48,213
every week?

1325
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:52,718
You have something that
not a lot of people have

1326
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:54,978
and people are drawn to it.

Your mom left today.

1339
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,870
She's moving to New York.

1340
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,950
Okay.

1341
01:17:57,974 --> 01:17:59,709
You hungry?

1342
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,782
I'm sorry. Did you take some
expired medication or something?

1343
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:11,230
Look, I know I haven't been
around much, you know.

1344
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:13,232
Your mom kind of drove me nuts,

1345
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:17,703
and I let that shut me down.

1346
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:19,896
Not that that's an excuse.

1347
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,488
You know, this is like the
longest conversation we've had

1348
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:38,447
since I was 12.

1349
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:42,819
You don't have to forgive me.

1350
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:46,923
I just wanna be more
involved in your life.

1351
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:52,571
Okay.

1352
01:18:52,595 --> 01:18:55,298
You got that awards show.
You need any help with it?

1353
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:58,610
Do you wanna come?

1354
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:01,805
Wouldn't be embarrassed
to have your dad there?

1355
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,451
[sighs]

1356
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:10,279
I don't really care about
high school anymore.

1357
01:19:12,849 --> 01:19:15,694
It's okay not to care
about high school.

1358
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:18,654
Just don't forget to
care about the people.

1359
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,615
Okay. Step through.

1360
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:38,183
Keep walking.

1361
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,576
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

1362
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:43,312
Okay.

1363
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:49,728
We can't be here.

1364
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:52,231
Why not?

1365
01:19:52,255 --> 01:19:53,389
Because.

1366
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,505
Welcome to Poetry Club.

1367
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,007
Shut up!

1368
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:07,579
I have a poem that is
for a friend of mine,

1369
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:10,883
and it's called, "Dear Jimmy."

1370
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:13,485
You are my friend.

1371
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:16,421
The most loyal friend
that will never end.

1372
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:20,225
You always say weird shit
that makes me laugh.

1373
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,161
And you throw the
sickest parties.

1374
01:20:22,185 --> 01:20:24,396
Look, a giraffe.

1375
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,165
This is terrible.

1376
01:20:26,189 --> 01:20:29,835
I had a dream last night

1377
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:33,196
that we dropped out of college
and became rock stars.

1378
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:38,177
That's not part of my poem. I
don't know why I said that.

1379
01:20:38,201 --> 01:20:39,635
That's weird.

1380
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:52,925
Jimmy, I hate poetry.

1381
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:55,861
But you're my friend, you know?

1382
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:58,097
And...

1383
01:20:58,121 --> 01:21:00,432
I really miss you.

1384
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:01,934

1385
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:04,060
for doing something
that you love to do.

1386
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:09,074
I read your poem.

1387
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:10,409
Seriously?

1388
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:13,278
It's really good, man.

1389

01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:40,399
Uh... what?

1405
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:42,234
For your leg.

1406
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:43,969
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1407
01:22:43,993 --> 01:22:46,071
I'm not playing soccer
at Indiana next year.

1408
01:22:46,095 --> 01:22:48,407
Oh, God, that's terrible.

1409
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:51,810
No! It's a good thing.
It's awesome!

1410
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:55,880
Now my dad's not on my back
about winning and my future.

1411
01:22:55,904 --> 01:23:01,210
Now I'm free to just kind
of decide for myself.

1412
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:08,560
So I was thinking,
man, maybe, uh...

1413
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:12,764
we could go on a date.

1414
01:23:12,788 --> 01:23:14,166
I'm not gay, Trent.

1415
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,859
Oh! Dude, bro, me neither.

1416
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:21,864
Okay.

1417
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:26,078
Hey! There you are!

1418
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:28,347
Hannah! Hannah.

1419
01:23:28,371 --> 01:23:31,016
Where are you going at
10:00 in the morning?

1420
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,518
I'll call you back. I'm
going fake dress shopping.

1421
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:35,254
You know, someone will
probably see me buy it,

1422
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:37,289
and then go buy it later
to feel cool or something.

1423
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:39,558
So I tipped off The Times
about my shopping today.

1424
01:23:39,582 --> 01:23:41,793
Okay.

1425
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:44,296
Uh, so I have a question.

1426
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,232
Well, it's more
like a huge favor.

1427
01:23:47,256 --> 01:23:51,203
Eric, you know that I would
do anything for you.

1428
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:55,940
Um, can you work your magic
for me for V.I.P. voting?

1429
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,743
Oh, and why would I do that?

1430
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,579
Hannah, you know everyone.

1431
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:02,747
People come to you
for everything.

1432
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,550
True. I could.

1433
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:07,586
But don't you still
hang out with Sylvia?

1434
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:11,556
Wait until you hear the
dirt going out on her.

1435
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,957
It's coming out later tonight.

1436
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:14,459
What dirt?

1437
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:17,096
Well, she had all this
stuff in her office...

1438
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,464
from when she was
still in high school.

1439
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:21,133
It was so pathetic.

1440
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:25,137
Why are you... Why are
you doing this to her?

1441
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:26,805
I'm not doing anything.

1442
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:29,241
I think the evidence
speaks for itself.

1443
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:31,600
Look, don't even think
about posting that.

1444
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:35,847
I do what I want, Eric.

1445
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:38,083
I've always been the one
to control this school.

1446
01:24:38,107 --> 01:24:39,418
We'll see about that.

1447
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,086
Is that a threat?

1448
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,088
I would say that's
definitely a threat.

1449
01:24:43,112 --> 01:24:48,184
Just to be clear, I'm
going to destroy you.

1450
01:24:52,355 --> 01:24:56,435
Good morning, Lake Odell High.
This is Hannah Ford.

1451
01:24:56,459 --> 01:24:58,270
It's the week before the
Student Choice Awards

1452
01:24:58,294 --> 01:25:00,004
here at Lake Odell High,

1453
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:03,375
and this may turn out to
be the strangest year yet.

1454
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:05,277
What a rollercoaster
ride it has been

1455
01:25:05,301 --> 01:25:07,346
for student Eric Schultz.

1456
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:08,813
From his bizarre cheerleading

1457
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:11,049
to his irresponsible
personal life,

1458
01:25:11,073 --> 01:25:14,553
this has resulted in one
very unpopular student.

1459
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:17,156
Rumors are out that Eric
is throwing himself

1460
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,023
in the race for V.I.P.

1461
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:21,226
When polled, 14% of students

1462
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,528
say they will vote
for Eric Schultz.

1463
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:27,031
This is down from 82% from the
beginning of the school year.

1464
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:29,301
When asked why they wouldn't
vote for Eric Schultz,

1465
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:32,204
89% say it's due to
suspicious behavior,

1466
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:34,906
while the other 11% simply said,

1467
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:37,041
"He didn't even play football."

1468
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,910
And with Eric out of the race,

1469
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:41,913
students are in dismay
with who to vote for.

1470
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:43,382
[giggling]

1471
01:25:43,406 --> 01:25:45,741
This is Hannah Ford signing off.

1472
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:51,856
Oh, this is so awesome.

1473
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,592
I'm breaking and entering
with Eric Schultz.

1474
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:54,617
Shh!

1475
01:25:56,252 --> 01:25:58,053
[engine starts]

1476
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,871
Okay, so... Dude...

1477
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,240
What?

1478
01:26:08,264 --> 01:26:09,765
But, Eric!

1479
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:16,581
Dude, where did you
even get these?

1480
01:26:16,605 --> 01:26:18,274
They enhance my masculinity.

1481
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:22,387
Wait, how do you know the code?

1482
01:26:22,411 --> 01:26:24,122
Hannah and I dated
in ninth grade.

1483
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:26,215
Oh, lucky bastard.

1484
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:30,052
[motor starts]

1485
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:38,303
All right, come on. Shh!

1486
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:41,139
Okay, so we need to get whatever
dirt that she has on Sylvia.

1487
01:26:41,163 --> 01:26:42,474
Can you do that?

1488
01:26:42,498 --> 01:26:45,477
Eric, I can do that in my sleep.

1489
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:47,270
Okay. Let's go.

1490
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,985
[exhales]

1491
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:56,087
Are you ready?

1492
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:58,257
Can I take one of her bras?

1493
01:26:58,281 --> 01:26:59,415
Sure.

1494
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:31,456
Okay, come on,
dude, let's focus.

1495
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,126
She doesn't have any
diseases, does she?

1496
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,218
Probably.

1497
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,356
[sniffs]

1498
01:27:44,727 --> 01:27:47,939
Okay, so...

1499
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:49,974
we need to find Sylvia
Martin on here.

1500
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:53,177
- Yeah, just give me a sec.
- Okay.

1501
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:54,879
Wh-What?

1502
01:27:54,903 --> 01:27:57,239
- Wait, what is that?
- Look.

1503
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:01,910
- Okay, print all of this out.
- Right.

1504
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:06,882
Hey, what are you gonna do?

1505
01:28:17,092 --> 01:28:19,037
Hannah's number one
on the A-List.

1506
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:21,897
- Wow.
- How did that happen?

1507
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:36,421
I'm going to puke.

1508
01:28:36,445 --> 01:28:38,089
I sniffed her panties.

1509
01:28:38,113 --> 01:28:41,183
That's not really something
you should say out loud.

1510
01:28:43,786 --> 01:28:46,765
Hey, loves. How are you?

1511
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:49,501
Really good. I'm excited
for the awards show.

1512
01:28:49,525 --> 01:28:51,102
Are you?

1513
01:28:51,126 --> 01:28:54,005
Yeah, I'm excited to see
who the winners are.

1514
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:57,442
Well, it is the most important
day of all of our lives.

1515
01:28:57,466 --> 01:28:59,110
Yeah.

1516
01:28:59,134 --> 01:29:00,369
Bye, loves.

1517
01:29:02,405 --> 01:29:04,349
All right, so did you invite
everyone over to my house

1518
01:29:04,373 --> 01:29:05,517
to go to the awards show?

1519
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,810
All but one.

1520
01:29:20,756 --> 01:29:22,601
I am so sorry.

1521
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:24,803
Are you just devastated

1522
01:29:24,827 --> 01:29:28,373
that Hannah's higher
than you on the A-List?

1523
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:30,642
So devastated.

1524
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:33,545
I know that you don't
wanna talk to me,

1525
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:35,213
but I'm inviting everyone
over to my place

1526
01:29:35,237 --> 01:29:37,382
to go to the awards show, so...

1527
01:29:37,406 --> 01:29:38,583
I wanted to see if
you could come.

1528
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:40,385
Who's everyone?

1529
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:43,555
Whoever wants to come. It's
our last party as a class

1530
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:45,590
so I feel like we
should all be together.

1531
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:47,559
What are you scheming, Mr.
Schultz?

1532
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:50,294
Absolutely nothing.

1533
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:52,588
Maybe I'll be there.

1534
01:29:56,358 --> 01:29:59,137
Hey! I have to show
you something.

1535
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:01,296
Check this out.

1536
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:13,585
[clears throat]

1537
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:15,454
Will you go to the
awards with me?

1538
01:30:15,478 --> 01:30:18,781
Well, with us?

1539
01:30:20,983 --> 01:30:23,762
I got fired. There is no
way they're gonna let me

1540
01:30:23,786 --> 01:30:25,430
anywhere near that school.

1541
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:27,532
All right, so what's the
worst that can happen?

1542
01:30:27,556 --> 01:30:30,268
Are they gonna fire you again?

1543
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:33,672
Eric, this is about you.

1544
01:30:33,696 --> 01:30:37,709
Okay, this is your time.
I had mine.

1545
01:30:37,733 --> 01:30:40,311
For better or worse.

1546
01:30:40,335 --> 01:30:42,404
You sure?

1547
01:30:44,507 --> 01:30:46,350
You don't wanna miss this.

1548
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:50,345
Yes, I'm sure, go.
Go, have fun, okay?

1549
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,751
Eric.

1550
01:30:57,419 --> 01:30:58,587
Thank you.

1551
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:04,159
Let's go.

1552
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,518
Hannah, congratulations on being

1553
01:31:19,542 --> 01:31:21,419
number one on the
A-List this week.

1554
01:31:21,443 --> 01:31:23,555
Are you anxious to see if you're
named this year's V.I.P.?

1555
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:26,324
I've always said there's no way
that I'm going to be V.I.P.

1556
01:31:26,348 --> 01:31:28,760
I haven't been higher than
top three on the A-List,

1557
01:31:28,784 --> 01:31:31,453
and then suddenly I just
popped up to number one.

1558
01:31:34,623 --> 01:31:38,260
Come on, Trent, let's go in.

1559
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,302
Um, I'm gonna see
you guys in there.

1560
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:52,216
Eric Schultz and I are tight.
We hung out the other day.

1561
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,086
I'm thinking about getting his
face tramp-stamped on my back.

1562
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,479
We're like besties now.

1563
01:32:04,286 --> 01:32:06,698
I don't think they make sense.

1564
01:32:06,722 --> 01:32:08,633
There's always madness in love.

1565
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:11,135
But there's also
reason in madness.

1566
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:13,061
Nietzsche.

1567
01:32:14,563 --> 01:32:15,631
You!

1568
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:19,277
Hey, cutie.

1569
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:20,645
Hey, Lace.

1570
01:32:20,669 --> 01:32:22,881
You having fun?

1571
01:32:22,905 --> 01:32:25,116
Surprisingly, I am.

1572
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,318
Feels like people aren't
trying as hard this year.

1573
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:29,845
- Yeah.
- I can breathe.

1574
01:32:34,116 --> 01:32:36,394
How ya doin' with all that?

1575
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:38,897
How do I know if it's right?

1576
