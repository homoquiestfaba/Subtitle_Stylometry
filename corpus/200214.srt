1
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:29,618
I witness

2
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,353
Yeah!

3
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,388
Fuck.

4
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,398
Dude, you all right?

5
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,400
You nimrod!

6
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,405
Oh yeah. Come on.
Come on.

7
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:36,421
I love Mexico. There aren't
any bullshit laws here.

8
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,426
You can ride wherever you like.
It's loose.

9
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,430
Hell yeah, man,
this is paradise.

10
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,433
Jud!

11
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,443
Come on!
Come on!

12
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,570
Terrific.

13
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,661
Yeah, yeah, hello?

14
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,666
Hello, Father.
What time is it?

15
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:49,674
No, no it's okay.
I'll meet you out front.

16
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,690
- Good to see you again, Father.
- And you, James.

17
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,693
One large black coffee, five sugars.
You're going to need it?

18
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,698
- Problems with the union?
- No, worse.

19
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,719
Bueno, gracias.

20
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,725
- Should I be concerned?
- Nah. It's not political.

21
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,729
My men were chasing some thieves,
one jumped from the roof.

22
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,732
The ground gave away under him.

23
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,734
We found a collapsed tunnel
down there.

24
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,738
- Twenty-one bodies and counting.
- Who are they?

25
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,741
Campesinos. The unfortunates.

26
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,744
We think they were digging a
drug runner's tunnel for Valdon.

27
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:04,749
- It must have, caved in on them.
- Who's handling the investigation?

28
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,751
Detective Castillo.

29
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:12,758
- Is he honest?
- He's homicide. Not narcotics.

30
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,763
Let him by.

31
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,767
Rhodes, I thought you were dead.

32
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,771
Wishful thinking, Douglas.
You're a long way from Mexico City.

33
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,773
War on drugs,
State Department priority.

34
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,775
- Didn't take you long to get here.
- Well, you know how it is.

35
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,778
Dig up a mass grave, everybody
starts talkin'. James Rhodes...

36
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,781
International Rights Watch.

37
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,785
Good to see we have the full
cooperation of the authorities.

38
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,789
This is a civil investigation.
It is none of your business.

39
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,791
My men will escort
you off the property.

40
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,793
Oh, well, ya see, that wouldn't
be too smart because them people...

41
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,795
will think you're trying
to cover something up.

42
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,798
Of course we are.
We're the Mexican police.

43
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,801
Captain thinks this is one of the
Valdon Cartel's...

44
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,803
cross-border drug tunnels.
There's no cover up here.

45
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,805
Oh, good. Well then
no one should be concerned...

46
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,809
with my organization's presence.
We'll want the usual.

47
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,813
Witness depositions, police files,
all the lab and autopsy reports.

48
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,817
You will get the file report
when it is released to the press.

49
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,819
International Rights Watch is
gonna wanna know what happened...

50
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,823
here and why, Cap., and we can do
this with or without your permission.

51
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,827
Carlos!
This man is trespassing.

52
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,829
Talk to him, Draper.
Remember, the border's right there.

53
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,831
With NAFTA the two
of you are in bed together.

54
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,835
His dirt rubs off on your
side of the sheets.

55
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,838
- Give us a minute.
- Sure.

56
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,842
I know you two'll wanna
get your stories straight.

57
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,847
You just love to piss 'em off,
don't you, Jim?

58
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,851
Well... just seems to happen
when I ask direct questions.

59
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,856
I'll talk to him.
Don't bank on anything.

60
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,860
I always said you were
a compassionate guy.

61
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,870
- Relax.
- Champions of human rights my ass.

62
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,875
We can always ignore them,
we did it in China. Joking.

63
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,878
Captain, you can bitch and moan
all you want but this guy's...

64
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,880
not gonna go away.
So cooperate. Let him observe.

65
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,882
You don't have anything
to hide, do you?

66
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,885
If the human rights people point
their finger at the Valdon Cartel...

67
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,888
which they will, then suddenly
everyone pays attention...

68
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,890
to Mexico's request for
more anti-drug funding.

69
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,893
Next thing you know, you're drivin'
around in a brand new Escalade.

70
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,897
Rights Watch fucked
the police in Chiapas.

71
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:37,902
That's what happens when civilians
get slaughtered in broad daylight.

72
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:45,911
We got young children,
men, women... oh God...

73
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,918
Enjoying yourself Gringo?

74
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,922
I know who you are.
This investigation is mine.

75
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,924
I don't have to give you shit.

76
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,927
Did any of the bodies
have any slogans painted on 'em?

77
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,930
Any of their hands bound?

78
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,933
This is Tijuana.
We don't have death squads.

79
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,935
- Any of 'em mutilated?
- What are you, deaf?

80
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,937
I told you it's not political.
There are no fingernails missing...

81
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,940
no bullets to the back
of the head, no cigarette burns.

82
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,943
Nobody hung by their neck,
feet or by their dicks. Comprende?

83
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,946
Got it.
Were any of 'em gagged?

84
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,948
I don't have time for this shit.

85
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,952
Detective, did you find any
tools in the tunnel?

86
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:37,963
No tools, huh? What were
they diggin' with, their hands?

87
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,969
Find out who these people were
and how they got into the tunnel.

88
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,974
Twenty-seven people dead,
Women, children, even a baby,

89
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,976
We'll know more after we get
the coroner's report,

90
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,979
Give me three days and
I'll have Darrow up there.

91
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,983
- I can handle this.
- Can you?

92
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,985
I've just come out of a meeting
with the Department of Justice.

93
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,987
They promised to take
up the matter.

94
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,991
But in the meantime I want
you to be very, very careful,

95
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,993
If there is a drug connection,
the Valdon Cartel will think...

96
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,996
nothing of killing
a human rights investigator.

97
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:16,000
I need you to focus on the union
election, Now get some sleep,

98
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,003
You're going to need it,

99
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,053
We don't need no fucking mericones
observers here. Huh?

100
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,060
You can find all the
information in your folder,

101
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,064
- Hey, Jim.
- How are you?

102
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,066
Good. We should get started.

103
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,070
Daxmoore employees will be voting
this week to accept...

104
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,072
or reject union representation.

105
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,076
As you can see, emotions for this
election are running very high.

106
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,079
You need to know that this
could get dirty.

107
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,082
Ah, everyone,
this is Emily Thompson.

108
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,085
She's a trade representative
for the U.S. Commerce Department.

109
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,087
Good morning.

110
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,090
I want to tell you all how pleased
I am that the Mexican government...

111
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,094
has invited American volunteers
to monitor this election.

112
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,096
Daxmoore is a U.S. Company...

113
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,099
and contrary to what union
organizers may assert...

114
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,102
they stand behind these elections
and are remaining neutral.

115
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,105
So please, if any charges
are leveled against them...

116
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,107
- consult me, before...
- Excuse me...

117
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,110
but you have no right to insert
yourself in this body's work.

118
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,114
- I can assure you Mr...
- Rhodes.

119
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,116
Ah, yes.

120
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,120
- I have no intention of interfering.
- Well you just did.

121
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,123
I'm curious why your
organization would...

122
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:24,128
send someone of your experience
for a simple union election.

123
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,202
Mr. Fields, document
everything that happens.

124
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,209
You are interfering with
a police action.

125
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,212
- My role here is strictly neutral.
- You have no role here.

126
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,214
- What's he doing?
- Tryin' to help.

127
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,217
Look, these are unarmed civilians
they have a right...

128
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,220
I'm Roy Logan, the Plant Manager.
Last thing we need here is violence.

129
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,222
You give me one minute...

130
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,229
No!

131
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,271
I gotta go.

132
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,314
Thank you.

133
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,317
Thanks for what
you did out there, too.

134
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,321
It's the least I could do.
I don't want anymore problems here.

135
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,325
Where are you from?

136
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,329
- Detroit. You?
- Pittsburgh.

137
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,331
Daxmoore Headquarters.

138
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:52,336
The whole operation used
to be there. Three thousand men.

139
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,339
Then they moved us to Tennessee,
'til the union came in.

140
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,343
Then they moved us here.
Labor costs.

141
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,345
That was a disaster.

142
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,347
And you helped how?

143
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,351
Contrary to what you think, Mr.
Rhodes. I care about these workers.

144
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,353
Ah, well, prove it.

145
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,356
Get your buddies at the State
Dep. To reign in the local cops.

146
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,358
In case you haven't noticed,
this is Mexico.

147
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,362
We can't just twist their arms
into compliance with our standards.

148
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,369
You don't have to twist
their arms, Ms. Thompson.

149
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:30,374
Just show 'em dollar signs.
That's your job, isn't it?

150
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,405
Detective,
how's the investigation going?

151
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,407
It's progressing.

152
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,413
That tastes good.

153
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,417
I'll be very interested
in reading your report.

154
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,424
Buenas tardes.
Captain.

155
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,458
Any messages?

156
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,471
Lady Anne.

157
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,474
Hello, James.

158
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,476
What are you doing here?

159
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,480
Darrow is in hospital.
He's got malaria.

160
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,486
Anyway, I wanted to see you.
Sit.

161
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,497
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

162
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:38,502
- I've been worried about you.
- I'm fine, really.

163
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,507
The Red Cross forwarded your
personal affects from the Sudan.

164
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,509
Thank you.

165
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:50,514
And this letter is from
the Mexican Minister of Justice.

166
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,518
It's granting you full access
to the investigation.

167
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,523
- You still feel up to this?
- Yes.

168
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,528
You know, James, you've done
wonderful work for the cause.

169
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:11,525
- Wonderful. But lately...
- I know. L- I know.

170
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,541
You still understand our purpose,
don't you?

171
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,543
Yes. I do.

172
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,550
You know, I'd always hoped
that one day...

173
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,553
you'd come to Washington
and work with me.

174
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,557
It could make a difference,
you know.

175
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,560
With your experience,
and determination...

176
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,563
they'd listen to you.

177
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:46,571
I'm a field man, Anne. I wouldn't
know what to do in an office.

178
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,575
Well... things change.

179
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,591
Not you again.

180
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,593
Your government's decided to
cooperate and IRW's part of...

181
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,595
the investigation.

182
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,602
Says you're an observer.
This is still my case.

183
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,604
Don't get in my way.

184
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,611
Castillo, what exactly
is your problem?

185
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,614
You people show up screaming
human rights...

186
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,617
and good cops start to lose
their jobs. Not the Jefes upstairs.

187
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,619
It's the little people like me
that get the shit.

188
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,621
Well if this case is clean
you got nothin' to worry about.

189
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,625
- I'm just here to help.
- Oh, like a saint, eh?

190
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,628
You gringos have been slappin' us
down with one hand and pickin' us...

191
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,630
up with the other for so long you
think it's the natural order...

192
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,633
of things. But let me tell you
something. I won't be slapped...

193
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,636
and I won't be patronized,
by some wanna-be hero...

194
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,638
who thinks he can ride
in on peachy white horse...

195
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,640
save us pobre Mexicanos.

196
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,655
- That's an observer.
- James Rhodes...

197
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,658
International Rights Watch.

198
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,662
Come this way.

199
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:25,669
Twenty-four victims.
Ages three months...

200
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,671
to sixty-seven years.

201
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,673
- Cause of death...
- Asphyxiation.

202
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:34,678
Si. Time of death approximately
sixty hours prior to discovery...

203
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,681
which would place the tunnel
collapse at about six a. M...

204
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,684
on Saturday the third.

205
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,688
What were they doing in that
tunnel? No tools were found.

206
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,692
The tunnel fell down on them
before they started to work.

207
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,695
- But how do you explain the children?
- Lack of daycare, Gringo.

208
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:56,700
That's the problem with these drug
traffickers. They never offer it.

209
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,702
You said there were
twenty-for bodies.

210
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,704
I counted twenty-seven
at the scene.

211
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,708
Three died from gunshot wounds
near the tunnel entrance.

212
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,711
- They were shot?
- Nine millimeter.

213
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,713
Close range.

214
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,717
How do you explain that,
Detective?

215
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,736
Oh you always seem to show up
at the right time, Douglas.

216
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,741
Just like Triple A.

217
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,754
So what time do you think it is?

218
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,759
Ten-twenty.

219
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,767
I was wondering if you
could do me a favor.

220
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:09,774
I was hoping you could keep
an eye on James Rhodes for me.

221
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,776
Uh, that's not a favor,
that's an affliction.

222
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,780
He's been investigating that
incident at the border, the...

223
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,783
in the drug tunnel
for the Valdon Cartel.

224
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,787
What exactly is Valdon involvement?
Are we talking fact or spin?

225
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,789
Fact.

226
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,792
Valdon's a pro, why would
he do such a sloppy job?

227
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,794
I don't know.

228
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,798
Who can see into the minds
of soulless men?

229
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,801
Certainly not me, Douglas.

230
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,806
So, what's the favor?

231
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,808
Rhodes.

232
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,814
All I'm asking for is
a phone call, Emily.

233
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,817
Just let me know
if he goes off on a tangent.

234
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,819
Is that all?

235
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,823
Sure you don't want me to
assassinate him or anything?

236
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,826
This is a very delicate time.

237
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,833
I got the cops to back
off on the union demonstrators.

238
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,836
This is gonna cost you.

239
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,841
It already has.

240
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,872
I saw it. Okay? I was there.
I saw everything that happened.

241
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,875
- Your people started the violence.
- They weren't my people.

242
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:56,880
They were wearing masks. The company
hired them to make trouble for us.

243
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,884
- It's that big thug, Zato.
- Look, all I can do...

244
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,886
is report what I see
and know to be the truth.

245
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,889
You want truth? Here is the truth.
They'll do anything.

246
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,893
Anything to keep the union out.

247
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,898
- What good are you, man?
- Not much.

248
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:19,903
- But I'm all you got.
- Juan, give the man a break.

249
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,906
He's trying to help us.

250
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,920
This way!

251
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,959
Father!

252
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,978
This is not your fight, Gringo.

253
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,982
Fucking priest you should mind
God's business and nothin' else!

254
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,984
Leave the priest alone!

255
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,988
No. No!!

256
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,010
No, I'm tellin' ya, man,
I recognized him, I did,

257
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,012
- He works for Daxmoore,
- Yes. I'm sorry.

258
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,014
- I cannot help you, senior.
- No. Get- get me a line-up!

259
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,016
- Just get...
- You do not wanna push you luck...

260
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,020
with them. They're not
as understanding as I am.

261
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:21,024
Heard you got your ass kicked
last night. Was it about my case?

262
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,027
No, I just seem to attract
love wherever I go.

263
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,030
I'm telling you my son and his
friend never made it back across...

264
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,032
the border. Now they're down here
somewhere and I want them found!

265
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,035
- We're doing everything we can...
- Anybody claim the campesino's...

266
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,037
- bodies yet?
- No.

267
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,044
- You don't think that's strange?
- No, this is a border town...

268
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,046
you know. They could be from
anywhere in Mexico.

269
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,049
People pass through
here like ghosts.

270
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,052
What if coyotes took the money and
then dropped the tunnel on them?

271
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,054
No witnesses.

272
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,057
The coyotes know Valdon
owns that tunnel.

273
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,061
He shits on people for fuckin'
with his property.

274
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,064
You're beginning to bore me,
gringo.

275
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,066
You know, Castillo, sometimes
I think you don't...

276
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,068
wanna know what happened.

277
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:11,074
Maybe you should just go back home.
They have to take you in.

278
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,081
You don't have a home, do you?

279
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,097
- Recognize anybody?
- No.

280
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,100
- He was big, you know, strong.
- Well what's going on?

281
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,103
The union organizers
were ambushed last night.

282
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:45,108
Mr. Rhodes recognized one of the
attackers as a Daxmoore employee.

283
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,110
Well I hope you're not implying
that it happened...

284
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,112
- at Daxmoore's behest.
- Well, who else stands to gain...

285
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,115
- Ms. Thompson? These people?
- Mr. Rhodes...

286
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,118
this is a Fortune Five Hundred
company. It's inconceivable...

287
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,121
they'd involve themselves in
something that stupid.

288
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,123
Well it sounds like a police
matter. Have you talked to them?

289
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,125
I made a simple request
to Mr. Logan to...

290
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,128
You have no right to be here. You
represent no government agency.

291
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,130
This is a criminal matter
and I suggest you see...

292
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,133
the proper authorities.
Don't you agree, Mr. Logan?

293
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,139
Thanks for your help.

294
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,156
- What's this?
- It's a D.E.A. File.

295
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,161
- D.E.A., huh?
- Ballistics report.

296
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,163
The gun that killed those
campesinos is the same one used...

297
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,167
on two D.E.A. Informants
who worked for Valdon.

298
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,174
Why didn't you give this
to Captain Madrid?

299
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:55,178
You're the investigating officer,
aren't you?

300
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:01,184
The Captain told me you're
an honest cop. Are you?

301
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,195
Have a good day, Detective.

302
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,237
Pedro...

303
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:38,221
Carmen, you trying
to seduce me?

304
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:44,227
James, I think you need
to talk to these men.

305
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,230
They've been working in the north
and they came home and they found...

306
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,234
their village deserted. They say
their families have been disappeared.

307
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,236
How many?

308
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,238
Twenty-seven.

309
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,288
Mr. Rhodes. Can you confirm that
twenty-seven peasants were...

310
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,292
buried alive by the drug cartel
in one of their drug tunnels?

311
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,294
The actual perpetrators
are still unknown to us.

312
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,297
What can you say about men who
commit such atrocities?

313
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,299
- What can be done?
- Cut 'em out like a cancer.

314
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,301
They're a disgrace to Mexico.

315
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,304
- Do they know who built the tunnel?
- Yeah. Francisco Valdon.

316
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,313
- Mr, Rhodes,
- Douglas!

317
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,315
Can you tell us who's behind
this terrible massacre,,,

318
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,319
- of innocent campesinos?
- Yeah, Francisco Valdon,

319
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,321
Valdon Cartel,
What can we do?

320
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,325
Cut 'em out like a cancer,
They're a disgrace to Mexico,

321
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,329
International Rights Watch has
named the Valdon Cartel,,,

322
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,332
as the perpetrator
of this savage mass murder,

323
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,334
Police investigators
will now try...

324
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,338
Doesn't he know where he is?

325
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,340
One of these days they're gonna
find his head in a box.

326
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,342
Well he's really brave
or really stupid.

327
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,345
- He's both.
- I thought you didn't like him.

328
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,347
You know he used to work
in the State Department?

329
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,350
- He did?
- He was very good.

330
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,352
Better than me.

331
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,357
- A little less diplomatic.
- Why did he quit?

332
00:34:54,425 --> 00:35:00,364
I don't know. He got angry one day
and he's been angry ever since.

333
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:06,369
What the hell.
Fingered Valdon for us.

334
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,374
Now if he gets whacked,
Valdon looks even guiltier.

335
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,377
God you can be callous, Douglas.

336
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,380
I'm just honest. Don't mistake
it for insensitivity.

337
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:22,385
No, thank you. I've...
got a lot of work to do.

338
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,425
- Lost Ms. Thompson?
- I wanted to see...

339
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,428
if you were still alive
after that interview.

340
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,431
- Here I am. Disappointed?
- Look I'm sorry about this morning.

341
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,433
I was out of line. I'm under...
a little pressure...

342
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,435
to make sure
this thing goes smoothly.

343
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:16,439
L- I wanna start over.
I come bearing an olive branch.

344
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,441
- What's this?
- That's an official letter...

345
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,444
from Daxmoore to its employees.
Anyone caught harassing...

346
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,446
union organizers will be terminated.

347
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,448
They've also agreed to start
an internal investigation...

348
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,451
to find out who assaulted you.

349
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,455
What?

350
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:37,460
Ah, promises are just words,
Ms. Thompson. Words are just wind.

351
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,464
- You don't get it, do you?
- Sure I do.

352
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,468
You're the one who doesn't get it.
This photo was taken at the riot.

353
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,472
That's the guy who attacked us.
He's the night foreman...

354
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,475
at Daxmoore, his name's Zato.
Daxmoore is pullin'...

355
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,477
the strings on this,
you can count on it.

356
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,481
Mr. Rhodes, Daxmoore cannot
control all of its employees.

357
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,483
They've worked long and hard along
with other American companies to...

358
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,487
build an industrial community here.
Why would they jeopardize that?

359
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:11,484
Look closer. It's about money.
Everything is about money.

360
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:17,500
You know, I didn't like you
when we first met.

361
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,503
But there's hope for you.

362
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:03,546
I wouldn't if I were you, gringo.
You're coming with us.

363
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,548
Someone want to meet you.

364
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,600
It's just a tape recorder.

365
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,605
That cost sixty bucks.

366
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,609
Sixty is cheap, Ese.
Buy a better one next time.

367
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,625
Forgive me.
I didn't get my dinner.

368
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:28,631
So, you think Valdon
is a disgrace to his country...

369
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,634
that he should be cut
off like a cancer.

370
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,637
Words like that can get a man
in serious trouble.

371
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,639
Honestly I wish I had said it,
but for the record...

372
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,643
they spliced different questions
in front of my answers.

373
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,646
You mean that our delightful
government-controlled media...

374
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:48,651
used you to put pressure on
Mr. Valdon? You must be very angry.

375
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,654
I can barely control myself.

376
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:57,660
My name is Enrique Gomez, Jr.
I am an attorney.

377
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,663
One of my clients is very interested
in what you've been doing.

378
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,667
One of your clients, huh?
You represent these guys, too?

379
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,671
Oh no, no, no. I'm just happy
to see them off the streets.

380
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,674
They were vatos from the barrio of
San Diego poppin' each...

381
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,678
other for kicks.
Now they have a purpose.

382
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,681
Well that must make you feel
warm all over.

383
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,685
Let's get to the point,
Mr. Rhodes.

384
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,688
Publicity is what you are all
about, isn't it?

385
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,692
You like to make a lot of noise,
draw the world's attention.

386
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,694
If I'm lucKy.

387
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:36,699
My client doesn't like publicity.
He did not kill those campesinos.

388
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,702
But even if you figure that out,
you have still plastered his name...

389
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,707
across the headlines, and
that makes these boys very unhappy.

390
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,711
Tell me about the tunnel.

391
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,714
You don't think they're gonna
kill you, huh?

392
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,718
Yeah, well... if they were gonna
kill me I'd be dead already.

393
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,721
Tell me about the tunnel.

394
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,724
The tunnel was shut down two years
ago when the construction...

395
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,728
crew hit a water table.
That's all I can say about it.

396
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,731
That's not enough. Maybe the
campesinos were there to dig...

397
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,735
a new tunnel. There was a cave in,
and the three who survived were...

398
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:17,740
- shot to keep them quiet.
- You're not even close, Mr. Rhodes.

399
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,743
My client doesn't hire women
or children.

400
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,747
Someone used the abandoned tunnel
for a graveyard - end of story.

401
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,750
Ah, so you want me to take the word
of a piece of shit like Valdon.

402
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,754
Ooh... those boys don't like
the way you talk about their boss.

403
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,757
Well, if they kill me no one else'll
look for another answer...

404
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,761
and they'll hang
those murders on your client.

405
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,765
It wouldn't be the first time.

406
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,772
Bolo, take this maricon
back to his hotel.

407
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,782
Mr. Rhodes,
a word of advice.

408
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,785
If you get too close
to the truth...

409
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,789
the men that did this
are gonna make you dead.

410
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,806
It's flooded.

411
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,809
What are you doin' here?

412
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,812
Your plug is probably fouled, too.

413
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,815
You got a spare?

414
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,827
- Gomez, huh?
- Yeah.

415
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:50,834
He told me Valdon had nothin'
to do with it. You know what?

416
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,836
I believe him.

417
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,841
All we've really got on him is
that Valdon once owned that tunnel.

418
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,845
They're playin' you, Rhodes.

419
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,849
I got a ballistics report hand
delivered from your buddy, Draper.

420
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,852
The gun used to kill the campesinos
is the same gun used to kill...

421
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,855
two carriers for Valdon.

422
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,858
Who were D.E.A. Informants.

423
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,861
I checked it out.
It's true.

424
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:26,870
Valdon's a lying murdering fuck.
You think I don't give a shit.

425
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:32,876
My family were campesinos, just
like those poor bastards that died.

426
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,881
Did they find the men
that attacked you?

427
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,883
Yeah, well they won't.

428
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,886
This isn't just between Daxmoore
and some workers.

429
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,888
This is about politics, amigo.

430
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,890
Government's in bed with
big business.

431
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,894
They don't want unions
they can't control.

432
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,896
So are you telling me your
government's behind it?

433
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:58,901
I'm telling you everyone's
behind it. The union will lose.

434
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,907
Claudio, is your friend
staying for dinner?

435
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,917
Thank you.
I've got work to do.

436
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,923
You have a nice family.

437
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:25,928
Couldn't be a policeman without them.
Why don't you get yourself a wife?

438
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,930
I wouldn't put a woman
through that again.

439
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,933
Who's gonna take care of you when
you're old? Mourn you when you die?

440
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,937
Somebody'll shake my ashes into
the ocean. That'll be enough.

441
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:19,041
You can come out now,
Detective, I won't hurt ya.

442
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:24,046
What are you doin' here, Rhodes?
Followin' me?

443
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,049
Actually I was out here
earlier this morning.

444
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,052
Come here.
I wanna show you somethin'.

445
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,062
New tires. Good quality.

446
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,067
These people got a truck but their
tires are as bald as my Uncle Billy.

447
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:49,071
So someone else was here.
Heavy truck.

448
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,074
Could be government vehicle
or labor contractors.

449
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:56,078
From the looks of these shacks
they got outta here in a hurry.

450
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,083
Why would a contractor come this
far when the city's crawlin'...

451
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,085
- with workers?
- Why take the old people?

452
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,087
And the children?

453
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,094
Man, it's desolate out here.

454
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,107
- See him?
- No.

455
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,109
Get in the car!

456
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:57,139
- People hunt out here much?
- Just for gringos and dumb cops.

457
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,153
Thanks.

458
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,160
You know,
something still puzzles me.

459
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,162
- What's that, gringo?
- Lf you're so sure Valdon...

460
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,166
killed those people what were
you doin' out at that village?

461
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,169
Just looking for more evidence.

462
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:32,174
Is that why you were diggin'
in the dirt? What was that about?

463
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:37,179
Have a good day, amigo. Remember,
this isn't your country.

464
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,191
Gracias.

465
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,224
How often do kids disappear
across the border?

466
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,227
It happens, But I've never
had two vanish at once.

467
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,230
What's your angle on this?
Do you know something I should?

468
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,232
Well maybe,

469
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,235
Twenty-seven people were buried
alive in a drug tunnel...

470
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,238
on the same day
the boys went missing.

471
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,242
- It's probably a coincidence.
- Coincidences make me nervous.

472
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,244
How do we get in touch
with the family?

473
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:47,249
Mr. Carter's in Tijuana.
They just found his son's truck.

474
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,263
Señor.

475
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,273
- Oh, Mr. Rhodes?
- Yeah?

476
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,275
You have some information
about my son.

477
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,275
Uh, possibly.

478
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,279
I'm investigating the deaths of
twenty-seven Mexican nationals...

479
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,282
- here and Tijuana.
- That's a drug case, isn't it?

480
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,284
Possibly. The boys disappeared
on the same day.

481
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,287
The same general area.

482
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,289
You're trying to link my son's
name to a drug investigation?

483
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,292
No-no-no. Both incidents
are extremely unusual.

484
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,295
They just occurred on the same day.
Maybe there's a connection.

485
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,297
- That's all.
- Look, my son...

486
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,300
has nothing to do with drugs,
Mr. Rhodes.

487
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,302
Good day.

488
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,314
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

489
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,317
Is this your brother's truck?

490
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,323
- Where'd they find it?
- Out by Red Rock.

491
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,325
Is that where
your brother went riding?

492
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,327
That's what they're saying.

493
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:12,334
But, uh, you don't think so.

494
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,338
Everyone knows that spot.
It's full of agro amateurs.

495
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:21,343
They've been searching out there
and haven't found anything.

496
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,346
Yeah.
Where do you think he went?

497
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:29,351
Here. Magics. See how it snakes
along those hills?

498
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,351
Yeah.

499
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,355
That's a killer
setup for deep washes.

500
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,358
And you see where it says UFB?

501
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,361
He only has two others like
that on the whole map.

502
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,364
What's UFB stand for?

503
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,367
Un-fucking-believable.

504
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,407
Hey!

505
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,410
Wait a minute.

506
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,413
Hang on here.
I'm- uh, your helmet. Uh, casco.

507
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,416
Yo lo quiero comprar?

508
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,429
Yeah, that's a,
that's a nice one, all right.

509
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:52,434
Tell ya what, I'll give ya fifty
bucks for it. Cincuenta.

510
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,437
No?

511
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,439
Seventy-five.
How about seventy-five bucks?

512
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,441
That's all I got.

513
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,448
What, my watch?
You want my watch?

514
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,455
It's a nice watch.

515
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,458
Shirt? You want the shirt off
my back? That's not gonna happen.

516
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,460
I'm not goin' home naked, okay?

517
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,463
You give me the helmet
now or the deal's off.

518
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,473
You drive a hard bargain, gringo.

519
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,478
Fuckin' land shark.

520
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,516
The prints on the helmet match
Huntington Carter's.

521
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,518
We also pulled a bullet
out of it.

522
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,520
- Homicide taking charge?
- Yes.

523
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,522
But something else has come up.

524
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,524
We ran all the prints against
the Federal data base...

525
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,527
and a set matched someone the
D.E.A.'s very interested in.

526
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:30,532
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Bolo Medina.

527
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,548
No Zato. You think somebody
tipped him off?

528
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,551
The first thing I learned when I
moved down here, Ms. Thompson...

529
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,554
there are no secrets.
Only lies.

530
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,566
I got two missing kids.
For six days. I want this guy.

531
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,575
- Bring him in.
- Thank you.

532
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,596
So what did you do?

533
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,598
What?

534
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,600
What did you do that makes you feel
so guilty that you gotta put...

535
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,604
yourself through all this?
I mean bein' a cop's a bitch...

536
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:46,608
but your job... one fucked up
country after another.

537
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,612
It's masochistic, man. You're
tryin' to make up for somethin'.

538
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,616
What is it?
Everywhere you go...

539
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,621
people expect you to sweep away
injustice overnight.

540
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,625
But you can't.
What's that do to you, man?

541
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,628
It makes me a little less impatient
with bureaucrats and cops.

542
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:10,632
- Other than that, I'm just fine.
- Sure you are.

543
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,634
That's why you got so many friends
beating down your door.

544
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,636
Hey Rhodes,
let's go out and party!

545
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:18,640
I wanna hear some more
atrocity stories, hombre.

546
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,644
Tell me. What happened?

547
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,648
You know, your English
is pretty good.

548
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:33,645
How long were you in the states?
Six, seven years? Livin' illegal.

549
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,658
Looked down on every day.

550
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,663
After awhile it felt like
one big prison, didn't it?

551
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:48,670
We're not really that
different you and me.

552
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,674
I just don't like refried beans.

553
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,682
You forget one thing. I get to
arrest people and you don't.

554
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,685
- That's got to fuck with you.
- That it does.

555
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,688
I might let you arrest
a jaywalker one day.

556
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:11,693
Only if I get to use your handcuffs.
Hey, you can even turn on the siren.

557
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,702
There he is.

558
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,755
Stay put.

559
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,791
I need to talk to you.

560
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,793
Come on in.

561
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,796
The man you identified,
Umberto Zato...

562
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,798
he didn't show up for work tonight.
He's disappeared.

563
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,801
- How rare.
- Logan said he...

564
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,805
doesn't know where Zato is or who
put him up to attack on you.

565
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:07,809
- You mind if I put on my pants?
- Nah, suit yourself.

566
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,815
Hey!

567
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,817
Hey...

568
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,820
I didn't know you
two were having an affair.

569
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,823
Very funny, Douglas.
What are you doing here?

570
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:25,827
Actually, I was dropping by
to see my old pal.

571
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:32,834
- I'm gonna put on my pants.
- Don't get dressed on my account.

572
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,845
This is a little awkward.
I suppose I should go.

573
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,850
- Answer a question for me first.
- Yes.

574
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,853
Is Daxmoore trying
to subvert the union?

575
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,855
Of course they are.

576
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,863
- You've known this all along?
- Yes, didn't you?

577
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,866
L... Why didn't you
do anything about it?

578
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,868
I don't have any proof.

579
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,870
Well what would you do
if we found proof?

580
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:13,875
The workers at Daxmoore didn't have
jobs before the company hired them.

581
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,879
Daxmoore built a factory
and gave them a new life.

582
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,882
You know what happens
if this city unionizes?

583
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,885
The tents come down,
circus leaves town...

584
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,888
and all these people are back
where they started from.

585
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,891
- So you're telling me...
- I'm telling you that...

586
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,893
nobody wants that.

587
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,898
I asked you a direct question.

588
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,901
If I find out that Daxmoore
is doing anything illegal...

589
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,904
then the hammer comes down.

590
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,906
Why do I feel like
you're patronizing me?

591
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,908
Inexperience.

592
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,924
You hungry?

593
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,935
- You want some of mine?
- No.

594
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,938
What's your per diem these days?

595
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,940
Prune and a quarter.

596
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,948
What the hell are you doing?

597
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,952
- Eating this pie.
- With your life?

598
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,955
You live like a fucking monk.

599
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,960
Monks don't drink tequila.

600
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,963
Salute.

601
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,971
Your principles are admirable
but you wear them like a flag...

602
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,973
on your ass.

603
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,977
Where do you wear yours?

604
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,985
I worry about you, Jim.

605
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,992
Thank you.

606
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,002
Waitress...
Dos.

607
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,018
- You have everything you need?
- Ready to go.

608
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,020
Ok.

609
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,034
State your choice.

610
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:56,037
Say it? Out loud?

611
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,041
- What are you doing?
- My job.

612
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:05,046
Verbal balloting is within
the law. State your choice.

613
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:09,050
- The union.
- Speak up, please.

614
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,066
The union!

615
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,079
No union.

616
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,099
- Castillo, did you get him?
- We've been all over the city.

617
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,102
Bolo's probably sunnin'
himself in Rio by now.

618
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,105
If we ever find him
we'll file for extradition,

619
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:09,110
- So what's next?
- Nothing's next, It's over,

620
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:12,113
What are you talkin' about?

621
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,116
The American kids
got killed by Valdon.

622
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:18,119
The campesinos
got killed by Valdon.

623
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,122
You hang around long enough,
you'll be killed by Valdon.

624
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,125
This is bullshit. You know
somethin' you're not tellin' me.

625
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,127
I'm very busy, Rhodes,
I gotta go,

626
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,130
Cas-! Castillo you're
holdin' out on me. Castillo!

627
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,133
I'm not holding out on you, okay.

628
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:36,137
If I could see your face
I'd know you were lyin'.

629
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:42,144
- Sorry, gringo, go home.
- Castillo. Cas-!

630
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,170
- The union lost.
- I'm shocked.

631
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,174
Order me one and
I'll tell ya a secret.

632
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,176
Why, don't you believe
in Santa Claus anymore?

633
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,179
Not even the Easter Bunny.

634
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,184
I'm filing a formal
complaint against Daxmoore.

635
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,187
- I bet that's got 'em scared.
- Oh yeah.

636
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:30,191
Yeah, they're quaking
in their loafers.

637
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,193
Well I guess you get
to join the club.

638
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,195
- Yeah, which club?
- The mighty warriors...

639
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,197
of the written complaint.

640
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:40,201
And this is where
we pray for strength.

641
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:44,205
Well then you'd better
order me a double.

642
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,210
Luis, dos doubles, por favor.

643
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:58,219
You know l- I gotta admit.
I was wrong about you.

644
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,222
You were right about me
from the beginning.

645
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,224
How so?

646
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,227
I got sent here 'cause
I screwed up.

647
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:12,233
I was in Sudan.
Famine relief.

648
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,236
And I had a few drinks in the hotel
and there was this reporter...

649
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,238
there and he was complaining
about the food and...

650
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:21,242
a hundred yards away there's people
that are starving to death.

651
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,245
So I punched him out.

652
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,252
You know what my job is?

653
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,256
It's explaining that the Sudanese
are dying needlessly to people...

654
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,260
that didn't know the Sudanese
were even alive.

655
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,264
I think I gotta get out.

656
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:49,270
I mean I don't know what
the hell I'm doin' anymore.

657
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:58,280
Oh, I don't know.
I think there's hope for you.

658
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,288
- I think you better let me drive.
- Are you kidding?

659
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,291
- I've been a lot drunker than this.
- Yeah? I'd like to have seen that.

660
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,293
I bet you would.

661
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,316
The gate is closed.

662
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,325
Rhodes!

663
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,330
Rhodes! Help me!

664
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:53,334
Okay, all- okay.
We're going, we're going.

665
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:58,339
Emily. Emily!
Emily just cooperate!

666
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:22,363
- We're being disappeared aren't we?
- Don't worry. It's a mistake.

667
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,366
Gentlemen, this woman is a U.S.
Trade representative she's got...

668
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,369
nothing to do with this.
Let her go.

669
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,373
Thanks for trying.

670
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,392
Come on.

671
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,398
Okay, okay.
L- l- I'll get it.

672
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,401
Here.
Just take the tape out, see?

673
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,406
What is that with you, people?

674
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,413
What the hell is that, Rhodes?
What's happening?

675
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:16,417
Ju- just try to stay calm.
St... Stay calm!

676
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:31,422
Mr. Rhodes. We meet again.
I heard you were looking for Bolo.

677
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,436
I think he went on vacation.

678
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:42,443
Labor problems. That's the price
my client has to pay...

679
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:47,448
- for giving his men too much slack.
- Gomez Jesus fuckin' Christ!

680
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,456
I'm very happy right now.

681
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:59,460
I finally see a way out
of this mess for Mr. Valdon.

682
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,467
Bolo's gun killed
three of those campesinos.

683
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,470
You've been lyin' to me.

684
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,474
Bolo was a very bad boy.
He was moonlighting.

685
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:17,478
- He... Moonlighting?
- Yes.

686
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,482
Even though they are very well
paid by Mr. Valdon...

687
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,485
- sometimes these boys freelance.
- I don't believe you.

688
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,487
I looked in the phone book.
There is no attorney by...

689
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:30,491
the name of Enrique Gomez, Jr.
In this town.

690
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:36,498
And just between you and me,
there's no Valdon, either...

691
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,500
is there?

692
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:47,508
The name itself inspires fear.
A very precious commodity.

693
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:50,511
But just between you and me...

694
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,516
one cannot find
what does not exist.

695
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,519
Goodbye, Mr. Rhodes.

696
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,523
I'm sorry to say
we won't meet again.

697
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,528
Come on. Come on.
Move!

698
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,578
- You all right?
- What's goin' on?

699
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,580
I'm afraid to guess.

700
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,583
Can't be too good.

701
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,603
- Dig.
- I'm not diggin' no fucking grave.

702
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:16,657
This is the Carter boy.
Bolo buried them here?

703
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:25,666
Looks like he was burned.
What?

704
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,669
The same thing was happening
to the campesinos.

705
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,671
They were developing
burns like this Ese.

706
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:34,675
- You never told anyone?
- They already knew.

707
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,679
- What coulda done this?
- I don't know.

708
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,682
Soil samples from the village
came out negative.

709
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,684
You have to go, gringo.

710
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,687
Wait! Which- uh...

711
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:53,694
Here. Get across the border
and get this analyzed.

712
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:57,698
- Can you give her lift?
- Absolutely.

713
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,701
- Go!
- Come on.

714
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,704
Get in.

715
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,718
Good luck, lady.

716
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:23,725
When you're done with the car,
drop it anywhere. It's stolen.

717
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,756
I'm Carter.
Where's my son?

718
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:59,760
This way, sir.

719
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:36,797
- What happened to him?
- Your son...

720
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,799
his friend, Jud Alexander...

721
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,802
died from gunshot wounds.

722
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,806
Thirty-aught-six caliber rifle
was the murder weapon.

723
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,809
We believe it will be traced...
to the Valdon Cartel.

724
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:52,813
We think your son witnessed a drug
deal in the desert.

725
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,816
Those men are butchers.

726
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:02,823
The boys were exposed to lethal
doses of methyl dioxide.

727
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:08,829
Yes, methyl dioxide and
traces of chromium sulfate.

728
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:12,833
The boys were buried
in contaminated ground.

729
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,836
Someone must have dumped those
chemicals in the junKyard...

730
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,839
sometime in the recent past.
We've analyzed the soil...

731
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,842
they were buried in,
and here's the report.

732
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,844
But the boys had the same kind
of burns on their flesh...

733
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:27,848
- as the campesinos.
- I'm afraid you're mistaken.

734
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,852
Detective Castillo told me
that he saw the burns.

735
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,854
I saw some bruises,
a large birthmark.

736
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,856
- Perhaps that was what...
- You're lying!

737
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,858
- Castillo saw the bur...
- Detective Castillo...

738
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,860
has been suspended...

739
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:44,865
and he's under review for taking
bribes from the Valdon Cartel.

740
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,869
- We'll exhume the bodies.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

741
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,872
They were cremated.

742
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,876
I wanna take my son home.
Now.

743
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:59,880
Come with me.
We have papers to sign.

744
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,914
Gringo.
Buenas noches.

745
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,916
What are you doin'?

746
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,921
She doesn't let me drink
in the house.

747
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:47,928
- They suspended you?
- Big surprise, huh?

748
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:51,932
Madrid.
Stinking son of a puta.

749
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:57,938
One day I'm gonna give him
a talking to. You watch.

750
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,944
I'm sorry.

751
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:08,949
I should've known better.
You can't fight them, Rhodes.

752
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,951
- Yes, you can.
- No.

753
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,955
- We did.
- We lost.

754
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,959
It's stupid.

755
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,962
I let you get to me.

756
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:26,967
I didn't get to you.
You got to yourself.

757
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:33,975
I got a family to support, Rhodes.
You? You've got no one.

758
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,976
What am I supposed to do now, huh?

759
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:38,979
Besides look over my fucking
shoulder everywhere I go, huh?

760
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,981
I'm sorry.

761
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:47,988
Get out. Go save some other
fucked up country.

762
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,991
Get out, Rhodes!

763
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:20,020
- You think he'll be all right?
- I don't know.

764
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:26,026
- Are you gonna be all right?
- I don't know.

765
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:31,031
Thanks for the help.

766
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:39,039
Good bye, Rhodes.

767
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:11,071
This is Rhodes.
Father?

768
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,078
Where?

769
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,081
I'll be there in ten minutes.

770
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,114
- El padre está aquí?
- Por allá Señor.

771
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,116
Gracias.

772
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,140
James...

773
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:24,144
Umberto has some
things to tell you.

774
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,158
What happened to you?

775
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:44,164
Bad things. I need to clear
my conscience.

776
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:48,168
Make things right so that
I can be buried next to my family.

777
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:51,171
The Lord forgives those
who make amends.

778
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:56,176
You must absolve yourself
of your sins. Tell him.

779
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,185
I was Daxmoore's night foreman.

780
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,188
And we'd been working
hard for weeks...

781
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:14,195
to get the new equipment installed.
Everybody's so tired.

782
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:18,198
I send them home early.

783
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:23,203
I wish I had gone with them,

784
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,205
A new chemical had been
delivered that night,

785
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,208
Something went wrong with
the storage valve,,,

786
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:33,213
and the floor got covered,
I had to clean it up,

787
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:38,218
But with the union elections
I couldn't use our own people.

788
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:43,223
That was just the kind
of accident those mericones...

789
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:46,226
would use against us.

790
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,233
I had used these villagers
in the past,,,

791
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:58,238
to clear an illegal parking lot,
Good workers,

792
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:03,243
And they lived too far away
to talk to nobody,

793
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:09,250
I only had a few hours,
So I hire everybody,

794
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:21,261
When they were almost done,
I call Señor Logan,

795
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,263
I wanted him to see
what a good job,,,

796
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,265
What are all those people
doing down here?

797
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,267
It's okay, they are
not going to talk to anybody.

798
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,269
That's not the point, you idiot,
they're covered.

799
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,272
I didn't know
it was such poison,

800
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,296
Should I make them stop?

801
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:01,301
No, finish it.

802
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:07,307
No one leaves.
You understand?

803
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,312
Señor Logan made a phone call,

804
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:16,316
Who did he call?

805
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:21,321
It is eating him alive.

806
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:32,332
How did the villagers
end up in the tunnel?

807
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:38,338
- This guy named Bolo shows up,
- Okay!

808
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:43,343
Slick and scary,

809
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:48,348
He said he had one more job
for the villagers,

810
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,351
A quick stop,

811
01:24:55,423 --> 01:25:01,362
I didn't know what he was going
to do, I swear to God,,, Oh my,,,

812
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,364
Okay.

813
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:11,371
He told them there were tools
at the end of the tunnel,,,

814
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,374
that needed to be carried out,

815
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:03,424
We drove to the desert
arroyo to dump the- the barrels.

816
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:11,421
When the barrels were emptied
the motorcycle boys came and,,,

817
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:17,437
they- they just drove
right through it,

818
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:23,443
God forgive me,

819
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:30,451
Who else knew?
Tell me who Logan called.

820
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,458
Tell him.

821
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:47,467
It was Captain Madrid.

822
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:52,472
They'd been paying him
to help break the union.

823
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,482
Father...

824
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,541
You all right?

825
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:04,544
I'm half Aztec
and half Conquistador.

826
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,570
I'm out of bullets.

827
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:35,575
We are under attack by Captain
Madrid and his men.

828
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:38,578
They have killed Father Perez
and Zato after the confession...

829
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:41,581
you have just heard.
Take this.

830
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,583
Take it and get
the hell out of here.

831
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,585
- Now way, hombre!
- Get out.

832
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:49,589
Get it to Detective Castillo.
This is proof. Go.

833
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,592
Go.
Go!

834
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,600
Madrid!

835
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,603
The boy works for Valdon!
He doesn't know anything.

836
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,605
I'm the one you want.

837
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:15,615
I know the truth.
Zato confessed to me.

838
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,617
I know everything.

839
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:20,620
Do you?

840
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,623
You're goin' down, Madrid.

841
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,625
I don't think so.

842
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,799
Ah fuck...

843
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:26,806
Captain, was this all
the work of Valdon?

844
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,808
Si. It was terrible.

845
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:32,812
Valdon kidnapped Mr. Rhodes
and Father Perez.

846
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,816
In our attempt to free
them Mr. Rhodes and...

847
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,819
the priest got shot
and killed by the drug dealers.

848
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:44,824
Three of my men are also dead
and a forth badly wounded.

849
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:48,828
We got three of Valdon's men,
the rest got away.

850
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:52,832
I think Chief Fuentes would like
to make a statement.

851
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:55,835
No, but Detective Castillo would.

852
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:03,843
We are under attack
by Captain Madrid and his men,

853
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:06,846
They have killed Father Perez and
Zato after the confession,,,

854
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,848
- you have just heard,
- Captain Madrid...

855
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:13,853
Captain Madrid,
you are under arrest.

856
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:35,875
Yeah...
He's in custody, yeah.

857
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:41,881
I did them a favor, you know.

858
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:48,888
My wife wouldn't
even come down here.

859
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:54,894
She said, I'm not movin'
to the third world.

860
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:09,909
No! No, please!
Please no, please, please.

861
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:12,912
I didn't... Please don't.

862
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,914
Don't- don't- don't- don't.
No don't!

863
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:18,918
No-no! No! No!
