1
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,216
- This guy is a total freak.

2
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,019
But I'm telling you, he's
growing weed in there.

3
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,843
- Hold it.

4
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,412
New jacket?

5
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,119
You really gotta
get a girlfriend, dude.

6
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,587
See you tomorrow.

7
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,875
- What are you doing in my home?

8
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,596
- Katlyn?

9
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,068
- No.
I didn't kill her!

10
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,870
- Get away, you freak!

11
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,083
- Hey! Hey!
I didn't kill her.

12
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,918
She was laying there
when I came in!

13
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,721
- Please!

14
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,695
- Does it hurt?

15
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,692
- You really want one
of those don't you?

16
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,606
Go on! Get!

17
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,441
Go!

18
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,211
Filthy creatures.

19
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,080
They carry germs and disease.

20
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,858
You wouldn't wanna make
mother sick would you?

21
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:20,031
Besides, young boys can't
afford to be sympathetic.

22
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,536
Not even to a filthy mongrel.

23
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,772
Jesus Christ.

24
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,447
What in god's name
are you wearing?

25
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,449
- I made it.

26
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,183
This is my medical.

27
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,951
This is my bird watching.

28
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,120
- Do you know what those
troop leaders feed on?

29
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,856
The innocence of little boys.

30
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,093
And I'm not gonna let some
sicko pedophile touch my child!

31
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,698
Next thing you know, you'll
wanna be an altar boy.

32
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,034
Snap out of it!

33
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,670
Mother didn't raise you
to be a little bitch.

34
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,973
You're better than that.

35
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,145
That's not for you.

36
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,413
- What is it?

37
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,816
- It's my protection.

38
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,652
Mama needs protection.

39
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,421
Now go make sure the
front door is locked.

40
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,723
- It's locked. I
already checked.

41
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,260
- Well, check it again.

42
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,064
What if some brute of a man,

43
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,234
let himself in here,
raped mother raw,

44
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,069
and then set her on fire?

45
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,946
An unlocked door
is an evil door.

46
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,996
Bless us, oh lord.

47
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,547
Filthy mongrel.

48
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,558
- Good afternoon.

49
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,795
- There was an accident today?

50
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,167
Under these circumstances,

51
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,270
we canvass the neighborhood,
ask some questions.

52
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,305
- Under these circumstances?

53
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,573
- There was a fatality.

54
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,976
Were you home this afternoon?

55
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,144
- I was.

56
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,745
- Did you witness the accident?

57
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,185
- You're gonna keep
doing this as long as it takes.

58
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,353
- Sir?

59
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,555
- No. No, I didn't.

60
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,593
- Did you see anything
strange or out of the ordinary?

61
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,028
- No. I'm sorry, officer.

62
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,631
I wasn't aware anything happened
until I heard the sirens.

63
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,701
- If you hear of anything
that might be helpful to me,

64
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,804
would you mind giving me a call?

65
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,241
- I'm sorry I wasn't much help.

66
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,349
- Oh, it's a goddamn
mess out there.

67
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,289
What the hell's
wrong with you today?

68
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,629
Oh, looks like you still have

69
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,464
some leftovers from taco night.

70
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:52,103
I want you to try heating these
on the stove for 20 minutes.

71
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,338
You're never gonna get better,

72
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,406
if you don't work on this stuff.

73
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,614
Do you have to keep
everything you find?

74
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,049
Try throwing something
away, just once.

75
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,885
It might be cathartic.

76
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,020
- A place for everything
and everything in its place.

77
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,688
- Honey, I'm here to help you.

78
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,090
It's my job.

79
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,291
- I know.

80
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,993
- I promised
to take care of you,

81
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,162
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

82
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:20,598
So get over yourself
and let me in!

83
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,102
Now give me kisses.

84
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,340
Ahh...

85
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,014
Only two of these per day, okay?

86
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,656
You've gotta work on this stuff.

87
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,568
- What am I gonna do with you?

88
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,293
- The hell you
doing in here, boy?

89
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,828
- Ow! Ouch...

90
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,332
- It's lunch time.

91
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,811
Oh, man. She was a
crazy bitch, dude.

92
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,480
Oh, and those curves.

93
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:01,219
I ended up spending
the entire weekend in Aspen.

94
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,687
Or as I like to call it,

95
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,790
a drinking town with
a skiing problem.

96
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:11,996
Man...

97
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,731
Oh, I got another one for you.

98
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,505
Boink!

99
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,078
Right?

100
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,452
- It's a good one.

101
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,953
- Yeah, it's just dope.

102
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,760
Thought you'd like it.

103
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,863
I found it the other
day by the carousel.

104
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,008
God, this park gets lonely
in the off-season, huh?

105
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,246
- I kind of like it.

106
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,582
- What? No.

107
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:10,855
No, there's no excitement,
no energy, no women...

108
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,458
You're the one who's
always complaining

109
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,393
about not having any friends.

110
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,903
I'm telling you, dude.

111
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,916
What are you smiling about?

112
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,286
- Nothing.

113
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,155
- Nothing?

114
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,626
Oh, there's something!

115
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,928
Come on.

116
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,666
I caught a big one.

117
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,908
- I met someone.

118
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,845
- What?

119
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,114
You met someone?

120
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,116
- Yes.

121
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,450
- Dude!

122
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,421
Yeah! That's great.

123
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,590
That's great, bro.

124
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,259
- Yeah. She's like me.

125
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,827
She doesn't like big crowds.

126
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,197
- Then you can stay
inside. You know?

127
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,999
- She likes staying in.

128
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,034
- Oh, I bet she does.

129
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,971
That's what I'm talking about.

130
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,959
- An unlocked door
is an evil door.

131
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,736
- Taco night.

132
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,704
Chicken with rice.

133
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,276
Taco night. Chicken with rice.

134
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,846
Chicken with
rice. Chicken with rice.

135
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,314
Chicken with rice.

136
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:54,051
Chicken with rice. Chicken
with rice. Chicken with rice.

137
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,021
Chicken with rice.
Chicken with rice.

138
00:25:57,023 --> 00:26:00,624
Chicken with rice.

139
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:04,929
Chicken with rice.

140
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,830
Rice. Rice. Rice. Rice.

141
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,825
Oh, father, lord in heaven,

142
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,126
thank you very much
for these gifts

143
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,288
that we are about to receive.

144
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,363
Thank you very much
for these moments

145
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:40,798
that we're spending together.

146
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,469
In the name of the father,
the son, and the holy ghost.

147
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,471
Amen.

148
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,079
Much better.

149
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,422
Hmm, pretty good.

150
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,463
Okay, now what?

151
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,843
You're heavy.

152
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,785
I need a better system.

153
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,035
It's for your own good.

154
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,135
Yeah.

155
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,439
This, however, is
not gonna work.

156
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,708
Good night, mother.

157
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,930
Do god's will and
take your pill.

158
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,244
Please bless mother and me.

159
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,747
And all of the
wonderful memories,

160
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,015
that we Cherish
together in life.

161
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,216
Amen.

162
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,725
Here we go.

163
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:42,793
- Anyways...

164
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,194
- Crazy big!

165
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,830
- I was reading a book with
my book club yesterday,

166
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,266
and I thought of you,
because the main character,

167
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,735
finds a way to
overcome his sickness.

168
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,618
- We were fucking on the cake.

169
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,587
We were fucking in the cake.

170
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,155
We were eating the cake.

171
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,557
We were fucking and
eating the cake.

172
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,209
- Anyways...

173
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,077
- Crazy bitch, man.

174
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,381
- Told those boys
a million times.

175
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:40,650
You can't use diesel fuel
in that kind of vehicle.

176
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,234
- I'm telling you, you
know how with marathons,

177
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:58,702
you've got to pace
yourself, man.

178
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,171
Well, Tanya didn't
want any of that.

179
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:03,440
You know what I'm saying?

180
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,691
- Anyways...

181
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,694
- She is a top ten crazy bitch.

182
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,596
- You might not
guess this about me,

183
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:32,302
but in my youth I was a cliff-diver
at a theme restaurant.

184
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,805
I know it surprises everybody.

185
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,874
- Oh, my fucking god.

186
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,822
- Because there were
dolls everywhere, man.

187
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:55,058
And you know me, I'm
always ready to go with it.

188
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,928
Have you ever had sex
in front of dolls?

189
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,585
- Anyways...

190
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,120
- This is a crazy bitch, right?

191
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,421
- I won't be able
to stop by later,

192
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:26,256
so I thought I'd drop by
and give you your pills,

193
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,157
and see if you need anything.

194
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,358
Gotta run. Bye.

195
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,639
- This woman is a crazy bitch.

196
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,141
And I fucking love her.

197
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:47,077
I think I love her and that's
just crazy enough, you know?

198
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,645
That's crazy in itself.

199
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,936
- You know the rules.

200
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,759
Hold still until it dries.

201
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,746
- Do god's will
and take your pill.

202
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,061
Please bless mother and me.

203
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,330
And all the wonderful memories,

204
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,031
that we Cherish
together in life.

205
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,837
- Good morning to you, Dan.

206
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,840
At least 50 police
officers, including the FBI,

207
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:07,276
are searching right now, over
night using blood hounds,

208
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:11,180
in temperatures near
freezing, and still no sign.

209
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,255
- And you know what she does?

210
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,290
This crazy bitch slaps me.

211
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,960
Boom!

212
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:26,863
Oh, man! Can you even imagine?

213
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:29,632
- Crazy.
- - Yeah, right?

214
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,267
I'm telling you.

215
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,003
Crazy bitch. That's
how I like 'em.

216
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,139
Oh, hey...

217
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,308
I found another set,
by the coasters.

218
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,151
So what do you do with
these keys, anyway?

219
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,787
- Keys are for unlocking.

220
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:55,758
- You're so Emo sometimes, dude.

221
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,160
- I like to imagine the
story that goes along

222
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:58,594
with each one of them.

223
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,496
- Well, some idiot
left them in his pocket,

224
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:04,200
got on a roller coaster,
and they fell out.

225
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,301
The end.

226
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,770
End of story.

227
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,839
Nothing more.

228
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,275
Did I ever tell you about Becca?

229
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,713
Becca? It's British. Becca.

230
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:19,382
Anyway, she wants to meet
up with me at a club, right?

231
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,118
So I show up. Guess
what she's wearing?

232
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,487
A fucking Burka.

233
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:25,888
I'm not gonna lie.

234
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,657
I was a little turned on.

235
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,464
- Hey, pumpkin.

236
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:36,365
- God, I wish
you wouldn't do that.

237
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,167
You know, it's polite
to knock, okay?

238
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:39,769
- So, I was talking to Lois.

239
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:43,573
Good heavens. What do you
need with all this ice?

240
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,475
Anyways, what was I saying?

241
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:46,375
- Anyway.

242
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:47,276
- What?

243
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,778
- That word is anyway.

244
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,046
There isn't an s.

245
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:51,914
- Whatever you say.

246
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,850
Anyway...

247
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,753
Lois says that there's
scientific proof

248
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,988
that cats are good
for healing the soul.

249
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,490
You should get one.

250
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,558
- I don't like cats.

251
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,127
- Well, that doesn't matter.

252
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:05,561
The cat will like you.

253
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,865
What is this?

254
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,034
- That's not mine.

255
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:13,503
- I can see that.

256
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,306
- Is this another
one of your finds?

257
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,407
- It's my girlfriend's.

258
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:21,077
- Girlfriend?
Since when?

259
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,114
- I thought you might get mad.

260
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,817
- Mad? I haven't
been this happy,

261
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:30,219
since my uncle Dave keeled off.

262
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,488
When do I get to meet her?

263
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,258
- Well, she's kind
of a home-body.

264
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,593
- Oh, that's so cute.

265
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:40,263
Don't worry, I
won't embarrass you.

266
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,834
Oh, this makes me so happy.

267
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,235
Now give me kisses.

268
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,309
Oh, you know what
else Lois told me?

269
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,045
Sarah, down the
street, has chlamydia.

270
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,680
Can you believe it?

271
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:59,649
She's married for 12 years.

272
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,084
I mean, how does that happen?

273
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:04,353
I don't know if she's getting
something on the side,

274
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,590
or maybe he is, but somebody
came home with something.

275
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:51,667
- Police, open up!

276
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:58,774
- An unlocked
door is an evil door.

277
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:00,843
- Afternoon.

278
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,745
- Can I help you?

279
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:03,846
- Yeah, we're looking
into the disappearance

280
00:48:03,848 --> 00:48:05,114
of a young woman.

281
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,617
- Recognize her?

282
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,385
- Goes by the name Katlyn Kelly.

283
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,854
- No, can't say that I do.

284
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,193
- Where were you the afternoon
of Monday the eighth?

285
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:20,763
- I was at work. I
work every Monday.

286
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:21,664
- And what time would you say

287
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:22,706
you got home that evening?

288
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,601
About 5:08.

289
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,071
- Look, we're just trying
to retrace her activities.

290
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,640
We got some reports saying that

291
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:32,575
she was in the neighborhood
that afternoon.

292
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,677
- There was an accident in
front of your house that day.

293
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,279
- Of
course. Yes, Trisha.

294
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:37,980
The neighbor girl
that was hit by a car.

295
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:39,415
- That's right.

296
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,384
- Yeah, what does
this have to do with Trisha?

297
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:44,086
- Well, Katlyn was visiting
Trisha from out of town.

298
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,022
We have some reports saying that

299
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:49,358
they were spotted together
in this neighborhood.

300
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,360
- That's horrible.

301
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,929
Any idea where she
might have gone?

302
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,051
- No, that's why we're here.

303
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,099
- Well, I apologize
that I don't have

304
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,768
anything to add to what
you're looking for.

305
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,002
- Ah, that's okay.

306
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:01,771
Look, if you remember
anything unusual

307
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,506
about that day, give us a call.

308
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:06,475
- Of course officers. I'm
sorry I can't be of any help.

309
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,533
- We're gonna keep
doing this, as long as it takes.

310
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,654
- Shut the fuck up!

311
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,721
Am I dreaming?

312
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:12,761
- Not ruling anyone out.

313
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:14,330
- We don't have
a person of interest,

314
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:16,132
and we're gonna
look at every angle.

315
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:18,334
We're gonna look at every
angle multiple times.

316
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:20,603
- Police are searching
vast areas of terrain,

317
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:22,271
including fields and lakes,

318
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:25,441
but bad weather kept search
helicopters grounded.

319
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,257
- So, stop pitying yourself.

320
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:44,160
And how about girls that fish
for compliments, that is my...

321
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:45,528
Hey, got any change?

322
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,297
- Yeah?
- Anyways, David.

323
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:49,939
- Do you know David?
- - Yeah, I know him.

324
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,801
- Hello!

325
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,738
Top of the morning.

326
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,242
Hola. Como estas?

327
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:02,077
Muy bien. Gracias.

328
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:07,716
Alright. See you
at noon, Jonathan.

329
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,786
I got plenty 'o stories,

330
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:13,088
for your enjoyment!

331
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,166
- I can't believe you're
still wearing that outfit.

332
00:53:57,168 --> 00:53:58,767
Well, if you wanna look foolish,

333
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:01,937
in front of all of these
people, be my guest.

334
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:03,005
- There it is!

335
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:18,921
What's wrong, mom?

336
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,557
- It's germs.

337
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:26,629
The disease and the
rot simmer in the air.

338
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,098
All of these sinners...

339
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,302
It infects my mouth.

340
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,673
Look at them.

341
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:38,874
Slut.

342
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,510
Adulterer.

343
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,746
Whore.

344
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:48,684
She's a whore, because she
gets paid to be a slut.

345
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:49,918
Now grow up.

346
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,132
You're different than these
disgusting little knee-biters.

347
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,236
You're better.

348
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:09,938
Look at them.

349
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:14,009
Judging me. Judging you...

350
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,213
It's not your fault.

351
00:55:18,215 --> 00:55:20,516
But it is your responsibility.

352
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:26,889
Now, give me kisses.

353
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:45,674
- Every fucking
day. Literally, man!

354
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,443
Every fucking day!

355
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,178
Can you believe that shit?

356
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:54,950
So how's it going with
your new lady friend?

357
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,921
Alright, I get it.

358
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:06,295
Oh, hey, remember that girl
Britney I was telling you about?

359
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:09,498
So the other day,
we're out for wings.

360
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,633
Do you know what
this crazy bitch did?

361
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:14,837
Three words, man.

362
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,004
Under the table.

363
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,708
I'll let you fill in the blanks.

364
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,048
Hand job.

365
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,421
Alright...

366
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,998
- A filthy house is
the devil's playground.

367
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,867
A filthy house is the
devil's playground.

368
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,802
A filthy house is the
devil's playground.

369
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,738
A filthy house is the
devil's playground.

370
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,675
A filthy house...

371
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:02,578
A filthy house is the
devil's playground.

372
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:33,775
- Police! Open up!

373
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,846
- Miss us?

374
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:41,216
- We've got
a few more questions.

375
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,417
- Make it quick.

376
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,220
- This is your house?

377
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:46,222
- Yes.

378
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,358
- How long have you lived here?

379
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,528
- 34 years.
It was my mother's house.

380
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:53,795
Please, be seated.

381
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,232
- Where's your mom now?

382
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:59,301
- She's passed away.

383
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:00,903
- How long ago did she pass?

384
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:02,437
- I was a kid.

385
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,940
But she left to the house to me.

386
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:07,409
So, when I was 18, I moved back.

387
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:08,544
These are all her things.

388
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:12,214
- Yeah? Yeah, we're
working in it right now.

389
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:13,415
- Am I a suspect?

390
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:15,784
- Oh, it's purely preventative.

391
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:18,854
We're just crossing
some names off a list.

392
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:20,255
- What lists?

393
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:23,926
- Well, we're
still looking for this girl.

394
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:25,961
- I remember the photo.
I still haven't seen her.

395
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,462
- Okay, so you remember

396
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:29,598
talking about Trisha
the other day?

397
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,467
The girl who got into the
accident across the street.

398
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,102
- Yes, of course.

399
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,211
- You gonna let us look around?

400
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:44,646
- Do you have a warrant?

401
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,124
- We wanna be safe don't we?

402
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:59,027
We're gonna do this as
many times as it takes.

403
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,097
Do it again.

404
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:05,267
Do it again.

405
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:07,670
Do it again.

406
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,439
Do it again.

407
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:13,642
- An unlocked door
is an evil door.

408
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:16,178
- You shouldn't let
those men in your house.

409
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,079
- How'd you get...

410
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,647
- your back door was open.

411
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:19,815
You're slipping.

412
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,852
An unlocked door
is an evil door.

413
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:26,521
- What are you doing here?

414
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:28,290
- Your door was wide open.

415
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,225
- They forced
their way into the house,

416
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:32,894
and were messing with
all of my things.

417
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,630
- Well, they'll be back.

418
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,533
Are you a suspect?

419
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,969
- No. I don't think so.

420
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:42,738
- I'll be back.

421
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,806
- No. Karen,
what are you doing?

422
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:59,087
- Stand up straight.

423
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:02,290
A young man's posture is
his compliment to god.

424
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,739
- They shouldn't
bother you anymore.

425
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:19,708
I've told them about
your condition.

426
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,609
- What?

427
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:22,110
- I'm here to protect you.

428
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,446
- Wait, what condition?

429
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:25,881
- I'll see you tomorrow.

430
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,119
- I don't have a condition.

431
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:14,963
Get a way out!

432
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,953
- So, last night, right?

433
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,797
This girl, man, she...

434
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,171
- A filthy house is
the devil's playground.

435
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,007
I'm sorry.

436
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:56,891
- Do god's will
and take your pill.

437
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,303
Keep it together.
Just keep it together.

438
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:50,338
Just keep it together.
Just keep it together.

439
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,307
Keep it together.
Just keep it together.

440
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,404
Good night, mother.

441
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:50,798
- Such a good boy.

442
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,567
Taking care of mother.

443
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,113
Did you forget something?

444
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,549
What'll it take to get this
through your thick skull?

445
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:11,619
A stove left on is
a house soon gone.

446
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,897
- Do god's will
and take your pill.

447
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:25,419
I saw what you did.

448
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,008
- Excuse me sir, I am
selling raffle tickets to my

449
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,644
awards banquet where me
and other young scouts

450
01:15:49,646 --> 01:15:52,346
from the community
are being honored.

451
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:53,414
- What?

452
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,550
- Eww! What happened
to your arm?

453
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:59,086
- Oh, yeah. I fell.

454
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,656
- Hello, sir. Excuse me sir,

455
01:16:01,658 --> 01:16:04,191
I am selling raffle tickets
to my awards banquet

456
01:16:04,193 --> 01:16:06,127
where me and other
young scouts...

457
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:07,562
- thank you.

458
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:10,031
- Young scouts from the
community will be honored.

459
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:11,799
- An unlocked door
is an evil door.

460
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,267
- And I would
like to know if you would

461
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:14,602
be interested in supporting...

462
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:16,504
- do god's will
and take your pill.

463
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:42,897
Proceed...

464
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,044
- Mom?

465
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,012
- Oh, god...

466
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:29,190
- Look, I
engraved your initials on it.

467
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:30,491
It works.

468
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:48,844
Mom?

469
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,051
Mom?

470
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:13,868
Mom?

471
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:17,104
Mom? Are you up there?

472
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:23,544
Are you in there?

473
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:31,285
Mom?

474
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,790
- You left the door open.

475
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:39,360
The germs, they're everywhere!

476
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,732
They're infecting me.

477
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:51,038
I can't get clean.

478
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:11,358
Please, help me.

479
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,666
- Hello, Jonathan.

480
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:02,269
- What'd you do with her?

481
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:05,105
- Her germs were
beginning to infect my mouth.

482
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:14,515
You know, if you love someone,

483
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:16,350
you really need
to set them free.

484
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:17,418
- Katlyn!

485
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:20,320
Katlyn?

486
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:21,455
- I did what you couldn't.

487
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:22,656
- Katlyn?

488
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:24,591
- I don't know what
you saw in her anyways.

489
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:27,027
Did you see those
disgusting lips?

490
01:24:27,997 --> 01:24:29,496
- Shut up!

491
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:36,336
I said shut the fuck up!

492
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:38,772
- Skip your pills today?

493
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:44,011
I always knew you
were a little bitch.

494
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:54,788
- Come on, finish it.

495
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,759
Do it. Come on! Do it!

496
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:03,063
You're even more fucked
up than your mother.

497
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:16,910
You see? This is why we
can't have nice things.

498
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,518
I told you, you need me.

499
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:48,942
- I'm sorry.

500
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:54,014
Sorry. So, so, sorry.

501
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:58,152
I am sorry, so sorry.

502
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:02,823
I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

503
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:14,201
I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

504
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,916
I'm so, so, sorry.

505
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,886
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

506
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:36,089
I'm so, so, sorry.

507
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,293
- Hey, what do you got for time?

508
01:26:39,295 --> 01:26:40,994
Hey, 2:48.

509
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:53,360
- Fuck it.

510
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:21,681
80 million years...

511
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:24,518
These were around
with the dinosaurs.

512
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,654
You know, the word orchid,

513
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:29,356
actually comes from
the Greek word orchis,

514
01:30:29,358 --> 01:30:30,924
which means testicle.

515
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,661
Well, the myth is that

516
01:30:34,663 --> 01:30:37,731
this guy orchis wandered
into a festival.

517
01:30:37,733 --> 01:30:39,299
He had way too much to drink.

518
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:42,502
And he found his
way to a beautiful,

519
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:46,373
beautiful, hot little,
young priestess.

520
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:49,242
He tried to have
his way with her.

521
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:51,511
You know what they did?

522
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,949
They tore him apart,
limb from limb.

523
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,018
Then, his mother tried to
get the gods to restore him.

524
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,486
But you know what they did?

525
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:01,688
They turned him into a flower.

526
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:04,791
A flower...

527
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,664
I could never understand
why they did that.

528
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,338
- I think they did it
because they wanted him

529
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:20,540
to become what he always was,

530
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:22,976
a beautiful, delicate flower.

531
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,511
- Well, shit!

532
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:28,315
It still grows on rotted wood.

533
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:57,277
- Sometimes, it's
better to be alone.

534
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:41,588
- Please bless mother and me.

535
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,089
And all the wonderful memories,

536
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:45,759
that we Cherish
together in life.

537
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:46,960
Thank you.

538
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:04,277
- Got any change?

539
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:06,413
That's fucking disgusting.

540
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:21,187
- See you at noon.
