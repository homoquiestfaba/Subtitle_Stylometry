00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:33,426
I have to get this
on camera.

366
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:39,499
Buddy, hand me
that mirror.

367
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,734
I saw this
on x files.

368
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,303
Saw this on x files?

369
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,541
He's alive.

370
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,978
Well, maybe buddy should
give him mouth-to-mouth.

372
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,046

Ohh, that stinks.

Oh, man. What do you got,
a demon in there?

377
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,592
Gosh.

378
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,793
I better go
get my dad.

379
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,694
Wait, wait.

380
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:12,465
What if he wakes up?
He could escape again.

381
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,071
Here, here, here.

382
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:21,374
Take that.

383
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:22,642
Ok.

Mrs. Taylor:
Tim Taylor,

392
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,144
how many times
do I have to tell you?

If the door is closed,
you knock.

394
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,683
Sorry, mom.
Where's dad?

00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,819
Your father is upstairs.

Mmm.

397
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,868
God, that tastes horrible.

398
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,540
Where the heck am I?

399
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,509
Why does my butt hurt?

Buddy: Hey, Taylor,
your mom's a babe.

403
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,153
The next word
will be your last, buddy.

404
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,723

what are you doing?

408

Dad, we caught
the bad guy.

What?

410
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,066
What are you
talking about?

411
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,636
The guy from TV
who escaped from jail.

412
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:57,737
He's in the treehouse.

413
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,938
And we trapped him.

414
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,240

to exercise here.

415
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,810

Come on.

I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

425
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,645
You know, I got a message
on our answering machine

426
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,779
from principal ott.

427
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,149
You guys wouldn't know about
a hallway prank, would you?

428
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:43,916
Wait until
you see this, dad.

429
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,184
It'll make up
for everything else.

Yeah, yeah.We could be
famous.

Timmy, I really don't
have time for this.

432

But he was
just here, dad.

Honest, Mr. Taylor.
He was just here.

434
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,711
That does it.

435
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,880
You don't do your homework,
you goof around in school.

your tape.

in such great shape.

worth something.

Trust me.
It was him.

for the plates?

Why else would he
come back here?

Yeah, but I don't
understand.

How's finding Carl banks
going to solve our problems?

I mean, we owe 50 large
to the Vegas syndicate.

518
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,166
Simple. We find Carl,
we get the plates.

We get the plates,
we print the money,

520

then we pay off
our gambling debts.

Yeah, like they're
not going to know

that the money's bogus?

00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,577
but seeing as how you're
an escaped convict--

547
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,880
whom you are
aiding and abetting.

548
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:50,216
Not exactly, since
I have every intention

549
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:51,984
of turning you over
to the police.

550
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,420
It's just I have to wait
a couple days.

551
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,254
Why?

552
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,655
Because I have
a current event project

553
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,891
due on Monday--you.

554
00:30:58,925 --> 00:30:59,658
Me?

555
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,593
Kid, I can't be
your book report.

556
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,461
Book report?

557
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,529
You're the mother
of all current events.

558
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:07,499
The only thing standing
between me and summer school

559
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,167
is you.

560
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,103
Mrs. Taylor:
Timmy, bedtime!

561
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:13,405
We can talk more
in the morning.

562
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,375
I better go inside
before my mom gets mad.

563
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,344
I'm grounded
because of you.

564
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,445
Hey, kid,

565
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,613
you don't know what you're
getting yourself into here.

566
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,615
Oh, and just in case
you have any thoughts

567
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,384
of trying to escape
in the night,

568
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,019
kato--that's my dog--

569
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,654
yeah.
We already met.

570
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,156
He's quite vicious.

571
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,623
Night, Carl.

572
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,225
Kid, wait.

573
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,528
Ohh.

574
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:20,239
Timmy:
Good night, Carl.

575
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:33,119
Come on, sweetie,
lights out.

576
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:36,288
I was just, um, working
on my current event.

577
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:37,256
Ooh.

578
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,358
Are you feeling
all right?

579
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,426
Mm-hmm.

580
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,094
I'm just
a little tired is all.

581
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:46,665
Well, come on,
let's get some sleep.

582
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:54,373
Mom...

583
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:55,307
You don't think
I'm crazy, do you?

584
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:59,545
Well, you do have
a very active imagination.

585
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:02,748
Of course I don't think
you're crazy,

586
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:06,418
but I do want you
to do well in school.

587
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,356
Thanks, mom.

588
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:13,059
Good night, honey.

589
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:28,640
[Clock ticking]

590
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,209
[Ringing]

591
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:34,746
[Stops ringing]

592
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,581
Carl: Oh...

593
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,450
So I wasn't dreaming.

594
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,420
What's with
the reinforcements?

595
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:44,756
That's Stevie,
and that's buddy.

596
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,725
Pleased to meet you.

597
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,595
Would you mind pointing
that somewhere else?

598
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,764
Knock it off, buddy.

599
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,201
Ok, look,
enough of this nonsense.

600
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,503
Why don't you just
let old Carl go,

601
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,337
and I'll try to forget

602
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,639
this unfortunate
set of circumstances?

603
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,641
No chance, slimeball.

604
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,577
At least not until
after the trial.

605
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,547
Trial?

606
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:13,619
All rise for
the honorable judge frito.

607
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,660
This court
is called to order.

608
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:22,728
Bailiff,
call the first case.

609
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:26,598
Stevie: The court recognizes
state vs. Carl--

610
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,800
what's your last name
there, Sonny?

611
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,437
Prosecutor, you know
the rules--

612
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,738
no court TV.

613
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:33,672
Exception.

614
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:37,109
This could be the next
trial of the century.

615
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:38,444
Carl:
This is ridiculous.

616
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:39,778
The defendant
will answer the question.

617
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,748
What if I refuse?

618
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,216
Ow!

619
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,552
Ow!

620
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,820
You little...

621
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,758
Banks. Carl banks.

622
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:53,692
[Beeping]

623
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:54,826
Timmy: Carl banks,
it says here

624
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,529
you're charged with 2 counts
of attempted counterfeiting

625
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:59,565
and escape from jail.
How do you plead?

626
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,900
Innocent.

627
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,634
Well...

628
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,836
Guilty with
a reasonable doubt.

629
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,837
Your honor,

630
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,608
my defendant wishes to plead
reasonably innocent.

631
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,710
Very well.
The state may proceed.

632
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:15,547
Where were you
Tuesday, march 4?

633
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,283
How the heck
should I know?

634
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:18,750
You lie!

635
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,286
Objection!

636
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,620
He's badgering my client.

637
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:25,257
Chill out, buddy--
I mean, prosecutor.

638
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,393
Answer the question,
defendant.

639
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:30,496
I was at a restaurant
called Benny's.

640
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:31,397
Benny's?

641
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,731
Yeah. It's like
a Denny's,

642
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,599
only, for wiseguys.

643
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,203
Permission to
cross-examine, your honor.

644
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:37,903
Permission granted,

645
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,471
but with very little
latitude.

646
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,307
Thank you, your honor.

647
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,674
[Clicks tongue]

648
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,710
So, Mr. Banks,

649
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:48,347
what did you have
for dinner that night?

650
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,448
You kids are crazy.

651
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,617
I'm not saying
another word.

652
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,752
Ow!

653
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,487
Ow!

654
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:56,588
How old are you, kid?

655
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,623
10.

656
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,924
Well, if you want to live
to see a nice, ripe 11,

657
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,393
you will stop
jerking my shorts.

658
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:02,661
Answer the question.

659
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,763
Pizza, I think.

660
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:05,697
Aha!

661
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:08,234
Your honor, defense
wishes to plead innocent

662
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:10,669
on account
of the pizza defense.

663
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,538
The pizza defense?

664
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:13,905
You were
temporarily insane

665
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,641
on account
of the pizza

666
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,975
affecting
your brain.

667
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,945
Objection.
Object this!

668
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:23,315
Counsel,
approach the bench.

669
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:30,756
Before the court
passes judgment,

670
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,258
will the defendant
tell the court

671
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:37,596
who lives
at 4521 lyndon Lane?

672
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,699
It was in your pocket.

673
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:41,800
Isn't that the old
Johnson place?

674
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,001
Yeah, isn't that where
all those kids

675
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,903
were trapped
in the fire?

676
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,738
Yeah. Yeah,
that's the place.

677
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,741
So answer the question.
Who lives there now?

678
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,278
The guys
I used to work for.

679
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,480
It was the headquarters
for their counterfeiting ring.

680
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,648
But you kids stay away
from there, you hear me?

681
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:57,483
What else?

682
00:36:57,516 --> 00:37:01,253
That's it. I'm not
saying another word.

683
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:05,324
Hey, where's my plate?

684
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:08,594
Uh, the court
requests a recess

685
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,862
to further investigate
the matter.

686
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,798
What have you done
with my plate?

687
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,601
The court temporarily
sentences the defendant

688
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,669
to the penalty box.

689
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,305
Penalty box?

690
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,284
Ok. My parents
went to get groceries.

691
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:33,719
That gives US
a couple of hours.

692
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,555
Stevie and I will go visit
the old Johnson house.

693
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,724
Buddy, you stand guard.

694
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,660
Heh heh heh.

695
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,435
D.j.: That was ocean
with I still love you

696
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:52,638
on Joe Willy's boss sounds
of the seventies.

697
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:53,572
Here's another
little ditty

698
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,975
sure to please all you
frank mcdonough fans.

699
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:57,543
Yeah.

700
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,378
You like music,
Carl?

701
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,646
[Rock music
playing]

702
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,780
I do...

703
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,882
Especially the oldies.

704
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,016
You know why?

705
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,086
Because it tickles
my funny bone.

706
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,756
You got
a funny bone, Carl?

707
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,692
I bet you do.

708
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,461
You see...

709
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:19,798
It's just a matter
of finding it.

710
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,734
Ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha!

711
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,503
Stop. Stop it.

712
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,838
[Laughs]

713
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,014
Be careful.

714
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,082
We can't go in there.

715
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,551
We're going to be caught,
arrested, thrown in jail.

716
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:43,922
Got to be better
than bummer school.

717
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:56,001
Timmy, I got
a bad feeling about this.

718
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,769
Let's go back.

719
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,638
What are you
in such a hurry for?

720
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,374
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

721
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:03,875
All right,
but if we get killed,

722
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:08,013
I'm telling everybody
it's your fault.

723
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,350
Let's go.

724
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,659
Whoa. Cool.

725
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,097
Think this is where Carl
does his counterfeiting?

726
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:30,035
More like where he goes

908
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:02,273
What happened?

909
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:03,308
Somebody help me!

910
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:04,442
He got the drop on me.

911
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,978
I wasn't going to talk, but
there was torture involved.

912
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:07,612
1, 2, 3.

913
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,580
Loud noises,
dismemberment.

914
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,616
I told him
about the plate.

915
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,718
You let him escape?

916
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:15,720
I am dead.
I am so dead.

Tim Taylor,

918
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:21,426
get your butt in here
right now!

[Sighs]

920
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,541
Young man,
your room is filthy.

921
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:37,575
How do you think
you're going to finish

922
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:40,478
that current event in
the middle of all that mess?

923
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:41,279
Hey...

924
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,248
I've got an idea
for a current event.

925
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:45,683
Clean your room--
now.

926
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:07,605
Good-bye, camp granada.

927
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:11,709
[Gasps] Carl!

928
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,311
Mmm!

929
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,047
[Muffled screaming]

930
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:21,018
Chill out.

931
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,687
What are you doing
up here?

932
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,356
And why are you
wearing makeup?

933
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,624
Never mind.

934
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,593
Look, you got to get me
out of here

935
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,195
before your parents
find out.

936
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:31,796
So? At least
they'll believe me.

937
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,464
I can't believe
you tried to escape.

938
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:37,668
I'm an escaped prisoner.
What do you expect?

939
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,205
Look, if your parents
find out,

940
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:41,672
they will have me
arrested,

941
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:42,807
and if I am arrested,

942
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,677
you can say good-bye
to your current event.

943
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,247
You got a point there.

944
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,382
Let me think.

945
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,819
We need a diversion.

946
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,423
Guys,
he's still here.

947
00:50:58,456 --> 00:50:59,424
Carl?

948
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:05,130
He's upstairs in my bedroom.
We got to act fast.

949
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,575
Yeah!

[Doorbell rings]

951
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:23,648
I got it, honey.

952
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:25,283
Timmy can't play
right now, buddy.

953
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,117
He's got to clean his room.

954
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:30,388
Did you know your car
has an oil leak?

955
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:34,559
Now, how'd that happen?

956
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,665
Rick, I'm right in the--

957
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:41,399
Timmy?

958
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,700
I just wanted
to give you a hug

959
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,470
and tell you what
a great mom you are.

960
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:47,772
You still have
to clean up your room.

961
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:48,673
Hey, and don't forget

962
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,708
you got your aunt Rita's
wedding tomorrow.

963
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:51,742
Sure, mom.

964
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,411
Ha!

00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:59,717
What are you
so happy about?

Yes!

968
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,741
Oh, no.

969
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,277
Ohh.

970
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:27,545
Ahh.

00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:28,813

00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:40,725
Like a movie star.

979

Ha ha. Prison
was easier than this.

984
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,337
You shouldn't have
left, Carl.

985
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:56,541
Oh, sorry, I forgot
to apologize.

986
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:57,475
Look...

987
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,511
All you got to worry about
is summer school.

988
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:01,712
Boo-hoo-hoo.

989
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:04,615
I got a lot more important
things on my mind--

990
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:06,217
like staying alive.

991
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:08,253
You have no idea
who's after me.

992
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,520
Well, we got
a pretty good idea.

993
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:11,356
We checked out
the old Johnson place.

994
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:13,624
I told you kids
to stay away from there.

995
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:14,592
You could get hurt.

996
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,660
Or worse.
I know.

997
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:16,627
Timmy:
We found stuff--

998
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:18,529
some kind of
printing device

999
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:19,597
and empty ink drums.

1000
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,465
Rolls of paper?

1001
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:21,732
It doesn't prove
anything,

1002
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:23,801
except that you are
who you say you are--

1003
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:24,702
a no-good counterfeiter.

1004
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:28,406
Look, do I look like
a criminal mastermind?

1005
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:31,976
For Pete's sake, I got
caught by a couple of kids.

1006
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:35,646
I'm a nobody. I'm just
a pawn in their game.

1007
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,015
Ah, what's the use?

1008
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,850
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1009
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,719
There were 2 guys there.

1010
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:42,887
We think they might've
been cops.

1011
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,955
They were cops--

1012
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:47,325
not the kind
you want to run into.

1013
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:48,626
They're
the boss' partners.

1014
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:52,497
He keeps them around to
discourage the competition.

1015
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,465
Look, you've got
to let me go.

1016
00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:56,401
I can't do that,
Carl.

1017
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:57,668
Hey, I could pay you.

1018
00:53:57,702 --> 00:54:01,439
I could print up, 10, 20,
$100,000, if you want.

1019
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:03,774
Isn't that
against the law?

1020
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,043
Yeah.

1021
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,679

is a goober!

00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,891
You got to come down
sometime, guys,

1024
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,560
and when you do,

1025
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,329
we'll be waiting.

We're trapped.

Carl:
Who's out there?

1028
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,633
Janie and Angela.
They live down the block.

1029
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:32,403

We got Janie and Angela.

you're afraid of
a couple of little girls.

1033

We're not afraid
of anyone.

1034
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,680
Yeah, well, why don't you
go down and fight them?

1035
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:45,716
Where I come from, we show
the girls who's boss.

1036
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,618
With what? All we got
is balloons.

1037
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:49,787
And the hose
is down there.

1038
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,056
If I help you
get rid of the girls,

1039
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:53,424
will you let me go?

1040
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:54,859
No deal.

00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,894
Ok. Uh...

out of this thing?

Hey, look,
where can I go?

1044
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:01,999
Your dog is still
down there, right?

1045
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,935
I can't go anywhere
with him around.

01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,755
Figured I'd try
for one quick score,

1145
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:28,759
and that's when I fell
in with a bad bunch.

1146

That's when
I started, like...

making funny money.

1148

There's nothing funny
about it, Timmy.

mesmerizing.

ran out of money,

some more.

But I outsmarted them.

01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:23,113
I stole
their money plates.

1170
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:25,449
I hid 'em in
the old Johnson place,

1171
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:27,818
which is where we were
printing the money.

1172
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:29,820
So you escaped
to get the plates?

1173
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:32,389
Yeah. I figured i'd
print up enough money

1174
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,024
to get out
of the country.

1175
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,093

the second plate,

1176
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,762

1177
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:40,831

running.

videotape
their whole operation,

for some traveling money.

to be there at the exchange

made phony money.
You see...

1217
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,870
First, you need a press.

1218
01:03:59,904 --> 01:04:01,538
You put the ink
on this,

1219

you put your plates
in here.

1220
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,375

they planted

on me.

1222
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:09,479

It would've been
my word against his.

1226
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,324
I guess that's about
the size of it.

1227

certainly will.

know each other?

Boys: He's our principal.

1238
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:04,268
They let you
work with kids?

1239
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:05,535
It's the perfect cover.

1240
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:07,537
Who would ever suspect
a grade-school principal

1241
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,607
of masterminding
a counterfeit ring?

1242
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,378
Which I almost had to
shut down, thanks to you.

1243
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,445
But that's all about
to change,

1244
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:19,416
if you'd be so kind as to
hand over the other plate.

1245
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:22,619
I don't have it.

1246
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,991
Search him.

1247
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:34,498
Nothing.

1248
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:39,569
My Patience is
wearing thin, Carl.

1249
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,344
Ok, ok.

1250
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:49,646
It's right, um...

1251
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,715
Over there.

1252
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,589
Run, kids!

1253
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,091
Get them!

1254
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,393

Get 'em!

1255
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:13,403
Buddy: Wait! What
about my camera?

1256
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:14,338
Timmy:
Forget the camera!

1257
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:16,673
It took me 6 years
without Christmas presents

1258
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:17,674
to get that.

1259
