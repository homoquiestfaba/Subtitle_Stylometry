(gavel bangs)

4
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:46,504
Order in the court.

5
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,674
Foreman, has the jury
reached a verdict?

6
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,809
Yes, your honor, we have.

7
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:58,815
The defendant and his counsel
will stand for the verdict.

8
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:04,452
Read on.

9
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:07,589
In the case of the state
of North Carolina versus Garcia,

10
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:11,559
the first charge of indecent
liberties with a minor...

11
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,361
not guilty.

12
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:14,629
Man: <i>What?!</i>

13
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:16,331
<i>(crowd shouting angrily)</i>

14
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,300
Order in the court!

15
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:23,239
The second charge of murder
in the first degree...

16
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,408
not guilty.

17
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,843
- That is bullshit!
- (all shouting angrily)

18
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:31,479
Order in the court!
Order in the court!

19
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,782
Order in the court!

20
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:39,821
<i>Were the facts and the evidence
in this trial irrelevant,</i>

21
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:42,390
or has the jury been asleep

22
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:46,393
<i>for the entire deliberation
of this trial?</i>

23
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:48,696
The defendant shall be released
from custody.

24
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:50,401
This court is adjourned.

25
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:04,548
I hear she has a sister.

26
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:07,381
Jim, Jim, stop!

27
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:10,551
- How do you defend this trash?!
- Jim, sit down.

28
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:12,686
Get yourself together, man.
He's not worth it.

29
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:15,292
I'm okay. I'm free.

30
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,559
(screams)

31
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,432
(all shouting and screaming)

32
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:55,332
Get that processed right away.

33
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:58,902
So, what now?

34
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:09,544
You know that stuff's
gonna kill you, right?

35
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:11,649
- Low dose.
- I was talking about the soda.

36
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:21,756
You put way, way, way too much
pressure on yourself, man.

37
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:24,759
You and the family
should just get in the car

38
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,893
and get out of town
for a while.

39
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,564
- <i>Take a long vacay.</i>
- <i>(telephone rings)</i>

40
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:32,436
I don't understand.

41
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:38,038
You gonna get that?

42
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,740
All right,
I'll get the phone.

43
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:42,576
<i>D.A.'s office.</i>

44
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:45,545
Uh, yes, ma'am.

45
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:48,384
Um, he's here.
Hold on for a second.

46
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,390
I need you to take this.
Hold on, please.

47
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,759
- This is James.
- Woman: <i>Hi, honey.</i>

48
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,763
Someone called
from the Cedar Falls

49
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:03,598
<i>County Sheriff's Department.</i>

50
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,066
Yeah? What's wrong?

51
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:08,602
<i>They found her this morning.</i>

52
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:11,607
I'm sorry. She's gone.

53
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,514
Oh.

54
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:22,816
We're gonna have to plan
the funeral right away.

55
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:25,552
So... it's about
a five-hour drive up there.

56
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,021
Why don't you get
the car packed,

57
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,922
and we'll leave
first thing in the morning?

58
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:31,092
We'll be up there
for a couple of weeks.

59
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,960
<i>Gotta get the house sold.</i>

60
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:34,694
Faith can watch Danny
while we're gone.

61
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:37,098
James: <i>No, actually,
I want them to come with us.</i>

62
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,598
Are you sure?

63
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,134
Yeah, yeah, positive.

64
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:42,770
- Okay.
- I love you.

65
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:45,709
I love you.
Okay, bye.

66
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,951
Mother's dead.

67
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,056
Oh...

68
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,672
Woman: <i>I'm sorry about
your mother-in-law.</i>

69
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:19,907
<i>I know you didn't
know her very well, and...</i>

70
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,710
Yeah, this whole thing
just seems so weird, you know?

71
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:23,677
Yeah.

72
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:26,179
Like, I just never...
I never got to know her.

73
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:29,150
And... I don't know.

74
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:31,018
I don't even know
how to read James on this,

75
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,619
you know what I mean?

76
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:33,987
Like, when's somebody's
so private

77
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:35,989
about their information,
about their family.

78
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,691
How is he holding up?

79
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:40,627
He's seems like he's okay.

80
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,763
It's just, you know, his dad
passed when he was young,

81
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:46,766
and he's alone in that respect.

82
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:48,704
<i>His family is gone.</i>

83
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,511
<i>It's definitely gonna
be interesting going there.</i>

84
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:15,763
<i>Wow.</i>

85
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:18,799
<i>Look at this town!</i>

86
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:21,802
Oh, I feel like
we stepped back in time.

87
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:24,170
It's very Americana.

88
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:26,807
I don't think much has changed
since I left.

89
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,712
Looks about the same.

90
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,146
Some things don't change.

91
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:36,016
<i>That school is very old.</i>

92
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,684
Woman: <i>Yikes.</i>

93
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:39,822
James: <i>They stopped using it
a long time ago.</i>

94
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,103
- Anybody hungry?
- James: <i>Hey, kiddo, you hungry?</i>

95
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:59,674
I bet you I know somebody
who's very hungry.

96
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:02,108
- This is the best behaved you've ever been.
- <i>Honestly.</i>

97
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,580
James:
<i>So, what do you want?</i>

98
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:16,857
You relax, kiddo.

99
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:19,160
<i>Why don't you finish
those fries?</i>

100
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:21,728
<i>If you're hungry later,
I don't want to hear about it.</i>

101
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,097
Are you sure you're all done?

102
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,298
Boy: I'm sure.

103
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,132
You're not gonna finish?

104
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:28,739
James: <i>No? You sure?</i>

105
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,267
What's wrong?

106
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,838
Did you see the way
that she was staring at Danny?

107
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,174
No.

108
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:10,343
No, uh, I didn't.

109
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:12,813
Just this place, you know,
I don't know.

110
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:15,281
It just feels kinda... stale.

111
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:18,852
- Yeah, like the coffee.
- (laughs)

112
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:21,155
No, honey,
I just think you're tired.

113
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:23,323
You need to relax.
Actually, we should get going

114
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:25,025
'cause we've got to stop
by the florist

115
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,327
before we get to the funeral
home, so.

116
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,165
Okay, let's go.

117
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:51,854
<i>(doorbell jingles)</i>

118
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:54,691
You all right?

119
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:58,825
You think grandma would like
these flowers right here?

120
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:01,197
Those are funeral flowers, bud.

121
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,800
<i>Hey, what do you think
of these flowers?</i>

122
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:08,102
<i>You like those there?</i>

123
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:11,372
Hi, there.

124
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:14,007
<i>Can we get a card
for him to fill out?</i>

125
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,078
Here, buddy. You can fill
that out for grandma, okay?

126
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:38,998
This place is giving me
the creeps.

127
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,103
There's nothing
but funeral arrangements.

128
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,241
"Oh, it's so nice
in the country."

129
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:49,343
It's so nice and all,
but this is what you get...

130
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,281
a lot of old people dying.

131
00:12:15,904 --> 00:12:18,171
- <i>Daddy?</i>
- <i>Hmm?</i>

132
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:19,473
Are we home?

133
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:22,577
No, Danny.
This is not our home.

134
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,381
This is gonna be a tough sell.

135
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,317
Is this ours?

136
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:32,319
I mean,
are we going to live here?

137
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:33,319
No, Danny, it was grandma's.

138
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:37,323
We're gonna fix it up,
and we're gonna sell it

139
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:41,896
'cause it's way too big
for the three of us.

140
00:12:41,898 --> 00:12:45,198
- James: <i>Let's go.</i>
- Okay.

141
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,337
All right.
(sighs)

142
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,346
We have our work
cut out for us.

143
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:02,051
Oy, you haven't seen
anything yet.

144
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:40,387
Hey.

145
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,122
I need you to help me get
some things out of the car

146
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:45,525
'cause we have to get ready
for the funeral, okay?

147
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay.

148
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,396
Where did you find this?

149
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,433
It came down the stairs.

150
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:01,143
James: <i>Hey, honey,
come here a second.</i>

151
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:08,884
All these toys?

152
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:13,253
- Yeah, what about 'em?
- They're mine.

153
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:14,921
Woman: <i>Well,
maybe your mom put 'em out</i>

154
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,156
<i>for the neighborhood kids
to play with.</i>

155
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:19,159
James:
<i>No, honey, look at them.</i>

156
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:20,560
<i>They've been out here
for years.</i>

157
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:23,296
I don't know.

158
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:25,531
I know that we've got to get
ready for the funeral, okay?

159
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,369
Yeah.

160
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:36,012
<i>(soft music playing
over speaker)</i>

161
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:04,474
It's over.

162
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:14,417
Come on.

163
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:31,298
Whatever we see
or then seen

164
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,601
is but a dream
within a dream.

165
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:38,237
I pray God wraps his wings
around you

166
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,409
and gives you peace,
Nadine.

167
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,133
James: <i>Hey, what do you want
to do with the other boxes?</i>

168
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,602
Um...

169
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,505
just, uh...

170
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:14,607
<i>just put them on the table,
and I'll get to them later.</i>

171
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,343
<i>(thump)</i>

172
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:17,745
<i>Be careful.</i>

173
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:21,115
James: <i>I'm fine.
There's so much crap.</i>

174
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:24,550
Woman: <i>I know. That's what
I've been trying to tell you.</i>

175
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:27,187
<i>Where's a donation
center nearby?</i>

176
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:29,292
<i>(both speaking indistinctly)</i>

177
00:16:54,316 --> 00:16:57,450
Gosh, look at all
of these pictures.

178
00:16:57,452 --> 00:17:00,319
Your mom, like,
had such a cool collection.

179
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:01,622
<i>Yeah, I doubt
she remembers the names</i>

180
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:03,560
<i>of everybody on the wall.</i>

181
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,431
Danny?

182
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,334
- James?!
- <i>What?</i>

183
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,169
What? What happened?

184
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:17,671
I don't know, your son...
I don't even know.

185
00:17:17,673 --> 00:17:19,606
"Your son,"
which means he's in trouble.

186
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:22,341
- Look!
- Whoa, what happened?

187
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:24,444
Is he down there
in the basement right now?

188
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:25,514
I don't know.

189
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,549
Danny?! Danny!

190
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,617
Why is that walled up?
It doesn't make any sense.

191
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,187
Mom probably had this walled up
after pop passed away

192
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,655
because his workshop
was down in the basement.

193
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,694
- <i>Go!</i>
- Danny! I can't...

194
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:44,263
Danny! I'm not gonna
be able to see shit.

195
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:45,699
Danny?

196
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:47,600
Danny, answer us
if you're down there!

197
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:49,636
I need a flashlight
or something.

198
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:50,572
Here.

199
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:54,576
Thank you, honey.
Perfect.

200
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:01,117
Well, be careful.

201
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:05,554
Jesus.

202
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,293
Son, you in here?

203
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:59,572
- (roars)
- Ah, shit!

204
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:01,575
Gotcha.

205
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:04,645
Yeah. (chuckles)
Yeah, you did, bud.

206
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:06,413
You scared the poop
right out of me.

207
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:07,548
- I did, didn't I?
- Uh-huh.

208
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,417
Yeah, so, uh, don't you think
it's a little dangerous

209
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:14,354
crawling around down here
in the dark, you know?

210
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:17,290
<i>And it kind of stinks,
doesn't it?</i>

211
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,358
- Yes, it does.
- Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,494
So, is there a good reason
why we're down here right now?

213
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:22,863
No.

214
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:25,499
So what do you say
we go back upstairs?

215
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:28,338
You know? All right.
Come on. Let's go.

216
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:38,345
James: This one
is called "The Raven."

217
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:41,615
"Once upon
a midnight dreary

218
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:43,684
while I pondered,
weak and weary,

219
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:46,619
over many a quaint
and curious volume

220
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:48,555
of forgotten lore,
while..."

221
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:50,723
Are you trying to scare me?

222
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:53,594
Why, no, I'm just trying
to entertain you.

223
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:55,561
Trying to entertain yourself.

224
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:57,897
(chuckles) Yeah, well,
that might also be true.

225
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,700
Are you tired?
You just wanna go to bed?

226
00:19:59,702 --> 00:20:02,703
Yeah?

227
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:04,374
Thy will be done.

228
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:08,244
Let me tuck you in.

229
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,680
I'll see you in the morning,
okay?

230
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:15,518
Okay.

231
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:22,856
Woman: <i>Hey, don't forget
to put away all those old toys</i>

232
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:24,924
- in the yard tomorrow.
- All right, yeah, I will.

233
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,529
Okay.

234
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,704
And my soul
from out the shadows

235
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:40,943
floating on the floor

236
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,542
shall be lifted nevermore.

237
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,811
(both chuckle)

238
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:47,880
- Are you trying to scare me?
- Maybe.

239
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:51,952
Yeah, well, it's not working
on me either.

240
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,486
Damn.

241
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:55,688
(laughs)

242
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,691
Good night.

243
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:58,959
Good night.

244
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,297
Yeah, good night.

245
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:13,408
Danny: <i>What's wrong?</i>

246
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:17,845
<i>You look very sick.</i>

247
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,619
Are you okay?

248
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:43,736
Are you a sleepy boy?

249
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:45,739
Yes.

250
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:48,474
Did your daddy's stories
keep you awake?

251
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:51,677
No, we were playing.

252
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,382
(laughs) What?
Who's we?

253
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:57,717
- He was...
- <i>(knock on door)</i>

254
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,787
All right, okay,
chew your food.

255
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:08,627
Hi, how may I help you?

256
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,428
Good morning. How are you?

257
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,030
I'm fine, thank you.

258
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:13,500
My name is
Father Donovan O'Malley.

259
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:14,967
And I'm sorry
for the intrusion,

260
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:17,937
but I knew the lady
that lived here.

261
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:19,641
- Oh.
- Yeah.

262
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:23,609
I'm sorry.

263
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:25,645
Yeah, I, uh...

264
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:27,481
I took it off this morning.

265
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,015
I'm a little bit clumsy
with my dress,

266
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,917
but my soul is tidy.

267
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,588
- (chuckles)
- Are you moving in here?

268
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,088
Oh, actually no, we're not.

269
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,758
This belonged
to my mother-in-law,

270
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,626
and we're just
putting it up for sale.

271
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:42,529
- Please, come in.
- Oh.

272
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:45,565
So, Nadine
was your mother-in-law.

273
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,067
Uh, yes, she was.

274
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:49,069
And James is your husband.

275
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:51,805
Yes. Unfortunately,
he's not here right now.

276
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,673
He'll be back
in a little while.

277
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:55,541
Look, I just put on
a pot of coffee.

278
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:56,542
Would you like some?

279
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:59,613
- I don't want to impose.
- Oh, my pleasure.

280
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:01,080
Thank you.

281
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:04,117
Oh, oh...

282
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,685
forgive me
for being so inquisitive,

283
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:09,623
but I remember that picture.

284
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,725
I knew Nadine and James
when he was just a little boy.

285
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:15,995
<i>It's a wonderful family,
full of faith and integrity.</i>

286
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:19,765
She was giving to a fault.
Really.

287
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,735
I never really knew her.

288
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:24,538
Really?

289
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,740
How do you take your coffee,
Father?

290
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:29,075
Pure. Unadulterated
and pure, thank you.

291
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:30,710
<i>Black it is.</i>

292
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:33,113
Hello.
What's your name?

293
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:34,447
Danny.

294
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:36,782
Okay, Danny,
not with your mouth full.

295
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:39,752
Hope I didn't get you
into trouble.

296
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,721
It's okay. I'm used to it.

297
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,623
Here you go, Father.

298
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:44,758
Thank you. Thank you.

299
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,460
Oh.

300
00:23:46,462 --> 00:23:49,596
- <i>Please have a seat.</i>
- <i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

301
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:51,865
At our messy breakfast table.

302
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:54,934
I'm really happy to be here,
thank you.

303
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:57,069
- Thank you for this.
- Excuse the table.

304
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:59,739
<i>It looks like we're having
crayons for breakfast.</i>

305
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:01,774
So, is the parish nearby?

306
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:04,010
Yes and no.

307
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:05,645
How's that?

308
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:07,914
Well, the building's still
there, but most of the people

309
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,782
have a rough time
getting out of the cold.

310
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:11,784
<i>Winter's come so fast.</i>

311
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:15,088
Sundays in Cedar Rock Falls

312
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,625
is mostly about TV
and housekeeping,

313
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:19,960
<i>not so much about worship.</i>

314
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:21,027
Mm.

315
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,597
You are the youngest couple
in town.

316
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,799
I had noticed that.

317
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,905
It's mostly older people
and no children.

318
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:34,640
Um... old age
is not contagious,

319
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:36,876
but it will happen
to everyone.

320
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:39,779
Most of the young folks,
including your husband,

321
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:41,615
<i>left town as soon
as they were old enough,</i>

322
00:24:41,617 --> 00:24:44,149
and the rest are merely
forgotten parents.

323
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:47,020
That's terrible.

324
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:48,754
<i>Not really.</i>

325
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:51,758
They treasure the solitude,

326
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,627
and, um, the quiet
is to die for.

327
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:55,794
<i>(thump)</i>

328
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:57,797
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

329
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,665
Holy shit is right.

330
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,667
Danny, don't say that.

331
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:02,868
Did I say that out loud?

332
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,806
I'm going down to the basement
and play with my friends.

333
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:07,941
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

334
00:25:07,943 --> 00:25:09,108
You're not going downstairs.

335
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,078
You can go upstairs
to your room, okay?

336
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,815
<i>Sorry. He has a new
imaginary friend.</i>

337
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:18,818
Not surprising.
It's age-appropriate.

338
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,953
Look at this.

339
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:24,824
Oh, and his father
reads him Poe stories at night.

340
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:27,694
Oh, really?
He likes the classics, huh?

341
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:29,095
- Yeah.
- <i>(door opens)</i>

342
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:31,865
- James: <i>Jennifer?</i>
- Donovan: <i>I should go.</i>

343
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,033
Oh, no, no, no, please stay.
It'll be a nice surprise.

344
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,235
We have a guest!

345
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:39,838
Huh? Who is it? Oh.

346
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,776
Wow, it's...
it's been a while.

347
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:45,678
Wow, I haven't seen you since...
easy, buddy.

348
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,813
You were 13.

349
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,117
Yeah, yeah. Come on in.

350
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:58,090
It's really been
that long, huh?

351
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:00,729
Yeah. I was there when you went
off to boarding school.

352
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:06,799
I'm very sorry
about your mother, my son.

353
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,301
<i>Well, knowing her
as well as I do,</i>

354
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:12,140
I'm certain that she'd be very
happy that you're all here.

355
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:18,778
James: <i>I think so.
I think so.</i>

356
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,713
<i>I just wish Danny
had the opportunity</i>

357
00:26:20,715 --> 00:26:21,848
<i>to get to know her.</i>

358
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,817
How old is he?

359
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:26,251
Oh, Danny? He's six.

360
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,723
<i>Oh, just about ready
for school.</i>

361
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:31,290
That's unfortunate.

362
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,827
Well, why is that?

363
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,764
Our school's been closed
for decades.

364
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:51,147
Damn it, honey. I thought
you had this door locked.

365
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,183
There must be something wrong
with the lock.

366
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:59,918
Okay, all right, I'll...
I'll fix it later.

367
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,788
Well, I think
I've overstayed my welcome.

368
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,856
Oh.

369
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:05,325
Well, Father, no,
we're happy that you stopped by.

370
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:07,292
- <i>It's great to see you again.</i>
- My pleasure.

371
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,229
And please,
come back any time.

372
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:12,065
With your special blend
of hospitality and good coffee,

373
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:14,770
I'd find it impossible not to.

374
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:26,178
<i>(door opens)</i>

375
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,115
Jennifer:
<i>He seems like a nice guy.</i>

376
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:31,784
Kind of open-minded, though,
for a priest, don't you think?

377
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:33,853
Yeah, I don't know.
I barely know the guy.

378
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:35,855
Well, he knows you.

379
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:37,357
Yeah, it sure seems
that way, right?

380
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,027
Jennifer: <i>He knew your mom
really well, too.</i>

381
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:43,128
James: <i>Well, he and dad
were old fishing buddies.</i>

382
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:48,268
Actually, I can recall that now
quite well.

383
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,940
He was around here
quite a bit.

384
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:55,809
You don't think that he
and your mom had a little...

385
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:57,176
Oh.

386
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,845
No.

387
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:01,183
No. Dad would have killed him.

388
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:50,800
<i>(indistinct whispering)</i>

389
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:56,034
- Danny?
- <i>(whispering stops)</i>

390
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,070
What are you doing
in here in the dark?

391
00:28:58,072 --> 00:28:59,371
Playing.

392
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:02,040
But you're
supposed to be in bed.

393
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,309
What... what the hell
are my toys doing out?

394
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:07,116
I didn't do it.
You scared them away.

395
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:11,353
Scared who away?

396
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:16,055
Okay, you know what?

397
00:29:16,057 --> 00:29:19,392
That is enough play time
for tonight.

398
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:23,096
All right, back to bed.

399
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:25,197
And you play
with your friend tomorrow.

400
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,200
- That's right.
- Okay.

401
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:29,434
Yeah, he has
an imaginary friend.

402
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,203
(sarcastically) Great.

403
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:33,205
Now you need to go to sleep.

404
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,942
- Okay?
- Okay.

405
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:38,110
- Night night.
- You listen to your mother.

406
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,346
Okay.

407
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:42,251
- Good night. Night, buddy.
- Good night.

408
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,089
<i>(whispering continues)</i>

409
00:29:50,492 --> 00:29:53,492
<i>(low gurgling)</i>

410
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:56,462
Go home.
I have to go to sleep.

411
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:59,335
<i>Come back tomorrow.</i>

412
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:24,859
Shoot.

413
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:34,466
Danny: <i>Mom!</i>

414
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:36,536
Hey, Danny?

415
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:38,240
What happened?

416
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,176
Oh, honey. Honey.

417
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,544
Oh...

418
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:47,579
Okay, you know what?

419
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:48,947
We'll keep this
our little secret.

420
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,983
We'll get you
all cleaned up, all right?

421
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,417
I'm gonna go start the tub.

422
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:54,287
- Okay.
- Okay.

423
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,358
(bath water running)

424
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:11,040
(screaming)

425
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:24,416
What is wrong with you?!
Why did you do that?!

426
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:27,185
- I didn't.
- You think it's funny?!

427
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:29,321
No.

428
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,556
<i>Then why did you do it?!</i>

429
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:32,328
I didn't.

430
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,196
You get in this tub,

431
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:40,034
and you don't get out
until I tell you.

432
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,273
- (laughs)
- Oh, my God!

433
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,210
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
Easy, whoa.

434
00:32:57,212 --> 00:32:58,543
You scared the shit out of me!

435
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:00,613
All right, all right,
I noticed, jeez.

436
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:03,148
- (laughs)
- Jesus.

437
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,617
What took you so long?

438
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:08,488
Well... actually, honey,

439
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,523
I have some very good news.

440
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:13,626
We have a prospective buyer.

441
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:16,162
Oh, my God,
that's such good news.

442
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:18,397
Yeah.

443
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,465
Yeah, it really is.

444
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:22,137
They're gonna stop by
sometime next week, so...

445
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,709
I need your help.

446
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:32,677
Yeah, sure, what can I do?
Hanging sheets?

447
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,614
I'm good at that.
Not really.

448
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:38,251
I need you to talk
to your son.

449
00:33:38,253 --> 00:33:41,453
Again, why does he always
become my son

450
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:43,423
when he's in trouble?

451
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:44,624
James, I'm serious.

452
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:47,260
What did he do?

453
00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:48,627
Nothing.

454
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:51,496
Really.

455
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:55,334
Come on, tell me,
Clearly, he did something.

456
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:58,604
He's blaming his mistakes
on his imaginary friends.

457
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:02,308
James: <i>What kind of mistakes
are we talking about?</i>

458
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,077
Jennifer: <i>Nothing.
I just don't think</i>

459
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,744
<i>that having imaginary friends
is good for him.</i>

460
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:08,780
James: <i>Really? Didn't you have
some when you were a kid?</i>

461
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:11,483
Jennifer: <i>Yes, yes, I had one.
Everyone has one.</i>

462
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:12,819
<i>He has several.</i>

463
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:15,123
<i>Don't you think
that that's strange?</i>

464
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,360
<i>(indistinct whispering)</i>

465
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:24,165
<i>(whispering stops)</i>

466
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:12,871
Hey.

467
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:15,875
Hey.

468
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,909
What are you doing there?

469
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:19,614
Coloring.

470
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:26,351
So, your mother tells me
that you have some friends

471
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,353
that are running around here.
Is that true?

472
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,355
Yes.

473
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:30,690
Yeah?

474
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:32,592
Who are they?

475
00:36:32,594 --> 00:36:34,759
I don't know. Just friends.

476
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:37,529
Now, Danny...

477
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,632
I don't want you hanging
around with these friends.

478
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:42,271
- Why?
- Because I say so.

479
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:47,373
But I remember
when I was growing up

480
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,442
all the way out here
in this big house,

481
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:52,911
all the way out here
in the middle of nowhere,

482
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:56,382
it got kind of lonely.

483
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,453
So I made up
these imaginary friends.

484
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:06,525
I don't want you hanging out
with the same friends.

485
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:08,530
They're not good for you.

486
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,466
What are you guys
talking about?

487
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:17,272
We're just discussing
his new friends.

488
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:23,409
Bud, what do you say
we get to bed, huh?

489
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:26,481
Come gimme a hug.
Come here.

490
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:42,561
Hey, you.

491
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:44,829
Hey.

492
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:46,699
Jennifer:
<i>Everything okay?</i>

493
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:49,467
James:
<i>Just one of those headaches.</i>

494
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:52,003
- Another sinus headache?
- Mm, yeah.

495
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:54,706
Yeah, I can feel it
coming on.

496
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,708
Is there anything I can do?

497
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,612
No, honey.
No, I got my medication.

498
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:02,750
I just gotta pick up
some more tomorrow, so...

499
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,854
You've already done enough.

500
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:18,433
(ticking)

501
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:46,891
Oh, God! I overslept!
I knew it was gonna happen.

502
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:49,764
I'm supposed to meet the buyers
in, like, 10 minutes.

503
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,942
<i>Didn't I set the alarm?
Didn't you see me set it?</i>

504
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:07,512
Yeah.
It didn't go off?

505
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:09,547
Yeah, no, it didn't.

506
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:11,016
All right, I love you.
I'll see you later.

507
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,717
Love you, too. Mm.

508
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,753
Wish us luck.

509
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:16,425
Okay. Good luck.

510
00:39:46,753 --> 00:39:49,558
<i>(door unlatches,
creaks open)</i>

511
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:28,956
- (gasps)
- (roars)

512
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:36,962
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

513
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:39,732
I thought I'd stop by
and check on you folks.

514
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,634
The front door was wide open.

515
00:41:41,636 --> 00:41:45,103
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

516
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:47,672
Is it?

517
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:50,208
Is... is what?

518
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,946
Everything all right.

519
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:56,782
Sure.
I-I suppose.

520
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:59,652
Can I make you some coffee?

521
00:41:59,654 --> 00:42:01,121
That's nice, thank you.

522
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,804
Where's the little one?

523
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:20,074
<i>He's upstairs.</i>

524
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,782
Damn it.
Was that door open again?

525
00:42:29,784 --> 00:42:31,183
No problem.
It's closed now.

526
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:33,117
It keeps doing that.

527
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,087
Yeah, probably explains
why they had it sealed up.

528
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:39,627
How did you know
that it was sealed up?

529
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:43,161
You mentioned it.

530
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:45,831
Did I?

531
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:48,099
<i>(loud crashing)</i>

532
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:49,103
Danny!

533
00:42:59,112 --> 00:43:00,080
Oh, my God.

534
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,918
Danny.

535
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,820
Danny... what happened?
Are you okay?

536
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:10,154
We were playing.

537
00:43:10,156 --> 00:43:12,291
Jennifer:
<i>Who is "we"?</i>

538
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:14,192
They're gone now.

539
00:43:14,194 --> 00:43:15,761
<i>Danny, enough.</i>

540
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:17,829
Should I close the window?

541
00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:19,701
Yes, please.

542
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:24,940
Oh, God.

543
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:29,176
What?

544
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,183
<i>(bird cawing)</i>

545
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:38,786
Nothing.

546
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:45,793
There was a raven
on the windowsill.

547
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:54,866
You know, I think I should...
I think I should take

548
00:43:54,868 --> 00:43:56,934
a rain check
on that coffee, okay?

549
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:59,204
Yeah. We need
to clean up this mess.

550
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:00,942
Yeah.

551
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:08,846
Oh, my gosh.

552
00:44:08,848 --> 00:44:10,217
<i>(birds cawing)</i>

553
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:54,425
James:
<i>So, just warn me now.</i>

554
00:44:54,427 --> 00:44:57,128
Is that kitchen a mess
with this fried chicken?

555
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,864
- Jennifer: <i>It's a mess. I know.</i>
- <i>Dad?</i>

556
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,299
Yes, buddy?

557
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:04,036
Can I bring a friend
to dinner?

558
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:08,040
Sure, would this be
your imaginary friend?

559
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:09,143
Yes.

560
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:12,143
Does he have a name?

561
00:45:12,145 --> 00:45:14,145
Charlie.

562
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:15,246
<i>Oh.</i>

563
00:45:15,248 --> 00:45:18,884
Yeah, I think it'd be great
if Charlie joined us.

564
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,154
He could sit right next to you.

565
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:24,889
He has a name now.

566
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:26,391
Yes.

567
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,427
I'm gonna get Charlie a plate.

568
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:32,032
I think that would be awesome.

569
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:49,915
Look what I found.
For Charlie.

570
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,382
What do you say to your mother?

571
00:45:51,384 --> 00:45:52,483
Thank you, mommy.

572
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:55,052
That is very sweet of her,
isn't it?

573
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:58,190
Well, maybe Charlie
will do the dishes.

574
00:45:58,192 --> 00:46:00,324
What do you think?
Right?

575
00:46:00,326 --> 00:46:02,897
James: <i>I'd be
his number-one fan.</i>

576
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:08,302
(whispers) He said
he'd be your number-one fan.

577
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,904
What are you doing there?

578
00:46:12,906 --> 00:46:16,208
He said he knows you.

579
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,076
Hmm. Is that right?

580
00:46:19,078 --> 00:46:23,348
That's interesting.
I don't know if we've met yet.

581
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:27,152
Yeah, you know, I don't know
if I know him, buddy.

582
00:46:27,154 --> 00:46:29,188
He said he heard you.

583
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:33,090
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he did.

584
00:46:33,092 --> 00:46:34,992
<i>I also hope he can hear me
when I say</i>

585
00:46:34,994 --> 00:46:37,061
that I don't believe
in imaginary people.

586
00:46:37,063 --> 00:46:40,234
(whispers) He said he doesn't
believe in imaginary people.

587
00:46:45,538 --> 00:46:47,538
He lost his appetite.

588
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,110
He's not hungry anymore.

589
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,380
Well, that just means
that there's gonna be more food

590
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:57,851
for the rest of us,
so that's just fine.

591
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:04,324
What the hell?

592
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:15,136
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

593
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:23,310
<i>(Danny screams)</i>

594
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:28,413
- <i>Danny?</i>
- <i>Danny?</i>

595
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:29,514
- <i>Danny?</i>
- <i>Danny?</i>

596
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:31,085
- Danny?
- Danny?

597
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:34,489
Danny, are you okay?

598
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,438
What is going on
in that little head?

599
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,475
James: <i>You all right?</i>

600
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,101
<i>(indistinct whispering)</i>

601
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,106
Oh, my God! Danny!

602
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,641
Danny! Are you okay?!

603
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:39,143
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- <i>What the hell happened?!</i>

604
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:40,545
- What happened?!
- Oh, my God, are you okay?!

605
00:49:40,547 --> 00:49:41,413
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Are you okay?

606
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:43,681
What happened?!
Tell me what happened!

607
00:49:43,683 --> 00:49:46,117
I don't know! I don't know!
I don't know! I just...

608
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,485
What the hell
are you doing with that?!

609
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:49,154
I was just standing there
holding it!

610
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:50,355
Oh, my God, are you okay?

611
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:52,456
Jennifer, back up.
Back up.

612
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:57,195
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

613
00:49:57,197 --> 00:49:58,366
Oh, my God.

614
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:10,177
Come here.

615
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:19,554
Here, here's teddy.

616
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:23,390
You okay?

617
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:50,482
No. I don't...

618
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:51,485
I don't want any.

619
00:50:57,623 --> 00:51:00,791
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

620
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:03,494
- <i>I could have killed him!</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

621
00:51:03,496 --> 00:51:06,797
- <i>I could have killed him!</i>
- <i>I know. It was an accident.</i>

622
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:11,402
Jennifer: <i>And... and I'm
sleepwalking and shooting?</i>

623
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:13,707
I want you to get rid
of that gun.

624
00:51:18,277 --> 00:51:19,714
I don't even know
why my mom had it anyway.

625
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:52,279
(children laughing)

626
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:18,473
Danny!

627
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:23,176
- Where are you?!
- <i>(children giggle)</i>

628
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:48,366
There she is.

629
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:49,701
Oh, God.

630
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:52,337
You okay, honey?

631
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,438
You all right?

632
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,840
What happened?

633
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:59,677
Danny said you took
a pretty nasty fall.

634
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:01,715
I remember running and, and...

635
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,552
I saw him.

636
00:53:07,554 --> 00:53:09,688
Easy. Easy. You saw who?

637
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,822
The little boy.

638
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:15,694
Okay, hon, I think maybe
you sat up a little too quickly,

639
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:17,661
and you're not
thinking straight.

640
00:53:17,663 --> 00:53:20,364
No, no, no, no, no.
I am thinking straight.

641
00:53:20,366 --> 00:53:22,567
That was him, wasn't it?

642
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:25,704
Mommy, don't make them
mad again.

643
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:27,938
Whoa, you two.

644
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,541
Honey, Jennifer...

645
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:32,376
I saw Charlie.

646
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:33,545
Right.

647
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:35,380
Don't patronize me.

648
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:36,915
Are you listening
to yourself right now?

649
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:39,650
Son, tell me,
did you see an imaginary boy

650
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:41,418
that mom's talking about?

651
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,920
Yeah? You saw him?

652
00:53:42,922 --> 00:53:44,956
Hon, do you hear
what that sounds like right now?

653
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,491
But I did. I saw him.

654
00:53:47,493 --> 00:53:50,395
That's fine. That's fine.
So, what did he look like?

655
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:50,831
Jennifer: <i>He's...</i>

656
00:53:53,866 --> 00:53:56,668
He was... he was small,
and he had dark hair.

657
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,670
- <i>He has a...</i>
- He had a scar.

658
00:53:58,672 --> 00:53:59,938
He has a scar.

659
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,708
Yeah, no, okay, I got it.
It's crystal clear.

660
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,710
You think that I'm crazy,
don't you?

661
00:54:05,712 --> 00:54:08,413
Honey...

662
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:10,382
- No, hon?
- I sound crazy.

663
00:54:10,384 --> 00:54:12,353
Hon, no,
you don't sound crazy.

664
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,820
Listen. Hey, you know
what I think?

665
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:18,556
I think maybe you need
to get out of the house

666
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:19,991
for a little while, okay?

667
00:54:19,993 --> 00:54:21,826
Just take Danny with you.

668
00:54:21,828 --> 00:54:23,895
<i>Maybe you guys go get
some ice cream or something.</i>

669
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:25,963
Does that sound good?

670
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:28,402
Yeah?
You feel up for that?

671
00:54:41,714 --> 00:54:43,614
I'm sorry, mommy.

672
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,983
For what, honey?

673
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:48,922
For everything.

674
00:54:51,023 --> 00:54:52,859
It's okay.

675
00:55:11,744 --> 00:55:13,614
Why is he staring at me?

676
00:55:17,016 --> 00:55:18,485
Let's ignore him.

677
00:55:24,924 --> 00:55:27,592
Good day to you, madam.

678
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:29,996
He's a handsome lad.

679
00:55:33,933 --> 00:55:35,502
Thank you.

680
00:55:38,772 --> 00:55:40,637
What's your name, son?

681
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:41,741
Danny.

682
00:55:43,743 --> 00:55:46,744
Old man:
<i>You look just like my boy.</i>

683
00:55:46,746 --> 00:55:50,547
I had a boy
just like him one time.

684
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:52,683
<i>About your age.</i>

685
00:55:52,685 --> 00:55:54,652
But he's not here anymore.

686
00:55:54,654 --> 00:55:56,920
Old woman: <i>What a lovely boy
you have there.</i>

687
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,590
He's so cute.

688
00:55:58,592 --> 00:56:00,090
Old man: <i>Wonder if I could
take him home with me.</i>

689
00:56:00,092 --> 00:56:02,726
Jennifer: <i>No,
that would be inappropriate.</i>

690
00:56:02,728 --> 00:56:03,927
Old woman:
<i>Do you need a babysitter?</i>

691
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:05,529
No, we're good on babysitters.

692
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:06,563
He is so handsome.

693
00:56:06,565 --> 00:56:08,532
My son was seven.

694
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:11,503
My son's
not coming home anymore.

695
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:12,770
Danny:
<i>Can we go now, mommy?</i>

696
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:16,741
Yeah. Sorry, excuse me.

697
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:18,777
I'd sure like to...
sure like to know him better.

698
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:20,411
You're scaring my son!

699
00:56:20,413 --> 00:56:22,846
Old man: <i>Did I offend you?
I'm sorry.</i>

700
00:56:22,848 --> 00:56:24,949
All I was trying to do
was say hello.

701
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:26,817
Excuse us, please.
Please excuse us.

702
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:27,888
- I beg your pardon.
- <i>Come on, Danny.</i>

703
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:05,757
Good morning.

704
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:08,592
Morning, Father.
How are you?

705
00:57:08,594 --> 00:57:09,761
Good, thank you.

706
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,598
- Why don't you come on in?
- Thank you.

707
00:57:15,768 --> 00:57:18,936
What did they want?
You know what?

708
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:21,605
Your dad can hire
a real-estate agent,

709
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:24,641
and he can sell the house
that way.

710
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:27,013
I'm done with this town.

711
00:57:32,853 --> 00:57:35,619
I need to just forget
about this house.

712
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:36,991
You saw him.

713
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:41,962
You saw him, didn't you,
mommy?

714
00:57:45,764 --> 00:57:49,067
Is he in your imagination, too?

715
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:50,704
I don't know.

716
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:56,643
But I know
one way to find out.

717
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:01,645
Sure I can't
get you something?

718
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:03,882
No.

719
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:06,650
I just stopped by
to see how things were going.

720
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:07,784
Yeah, yeah, well,

721
00:58:07,786 --> 00:58:10,188
aside from a few bumps
in the night,

722
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,190
I'd say all is good.

723
00:58:12,192 --> 00:58:13,726
Bumps?

724
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:17,797
Understandable.

725
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:24,101
Okay, come on in, buddy.
Come here, come here.

726
00:58:24,103 --> 00:58:25,806
All right.

727
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,109
Hello?

728
00:58:31,744 --> 00:58:33,844
<i>Hello?</i>

729
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:36,014
Donovan: <i>You know, people say
that organized religion</i>

730
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:38,081
<i>is for people that
are afraid to go to hell</i>

731
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,652
and that spirituality
is for people

732
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:42,822
that have already
been there.

733
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,992
Did you mother ever talk to you
about your adolescence?

734
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:51,061
My adolescence.

735
00:58:51,063 --> 00:58:53,965
Yeah.

736
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:56,837
A time when you were too young
to remember anything specific.

737
00:59:16,822 --> 00:59:18,690
Where are you going
with this?

738
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:19,791
I have to know...

739
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:22,259
do you remember the details
of your car accident?

740
00:59:22,261 --> 00:59:25,131
Well... of course, I do.

741
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:29,266
I was 13 years old.

742
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:30,904
They say that I nearly died.

743
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:42,880
Oh, my God.

744
00:59:42,882 --> 00:59:46,050
Oh, your life was definitely
hanging by a thread.

745
00:59:46,052 --> 00:59:47,819
So I heard.

746
00:59:47,821 --> 00:59:50,221
Yeah. What about
before the accident?

747
00:59:50,223 --> 00:59:52,824
- Anything?
- <i>No.</i>

748
00:59:52,826 --> 00:59:54,094
Why?

749
01:00:02,802 --> 01:00:04,335
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be odd.

750
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:07,105
It's the mind of a theologian.

751
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:11,041
You know, the two most useless
things to a pilot

752
01:00:11,043 --> 01:00:14,177
is the runway behind him
and the sky above him.

753
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:17,315
I'm just happy that you're home,
and you have a beautiful family

754
01:00:17,317 --> 01:00:19,050
and you're thriving.

755
01:00:19,052 --> 01:00:21,351
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.

756
01:00:21,353 --> 01:00:23,855
<i>It's, uh...
it's good to be home.</i>

757
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:27,125
It's just strange
with all this...

758
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:29,059
sinking in.

759
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:31,061
<i>There's a lot of memories here.</i>

760
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:33,998
All these objects.

761
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,003
That must bring back
some pretty strong emotions.

762
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,008
It does.

763
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,878
Um...

764
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,846
please give my regards
to the children, will you?

765
01:00:48,848 --> 01:00:50,213
I most certainly will.

766
01:00:50,215 --> 01:00:51,685
Good, thank you.

767
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:53,947
Come on, honey.

768
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,770
<i>(air horn blaring)</i>

769
01:02:29,248 --> 01:02:30,384
(no voice)

770
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:45,456
James?

771
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,994
<i>Are you down there?</i>

772
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,136
James, what were you doing
down there?

773
01:03:57,569 --> 01:04:00,039
Just putting away
my old toys.

774
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:06,009
Are you okay?

775
01:04:06,011 --> 01:04:08,311
Oh, I'm fantastic.

776
01:04:08,313 --> 01:04:10,016
(curtly)
How are you, <i>honey?</i>

777
01:04:14,554 --> 01:04:17,121
Go upstairs, okay?
All right?

778
01:04:17,123 --> 01:04:18,422
Mommy's got to talk
to daddy.

779
01:04:18,424 --> 01:04:20,027
Danny, mind your mother.

780
01:04:22,228 --> 01:04:24,395
He's a good kid.

781
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:27,197
You have no idea
what we just saw.

782
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:29,366
There, there was
this horrible accident,

783
01:04:29,368 --> 01:04:31,369
and everybody...
everybody was dead.

784
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:33,503
There was blood everywhere,
and then these people

785
01:04:33,505 --> 01:04:34,505
were following us
at the mall, James.

786
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:37,174
These older people
wouldn't leave us alone...

787
01:04:37,176 --> 01:04:39,076
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where is this going?

788
01:04:39,078 --> 01:04:40,980
What are you talking about?

789
01:04:47,085 --> 01:04:49,286
- Where'd you get that?
- At the newspaper office.

790
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:51,190
- I thought you went to the mall.
- We did.

791
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:55,428
Do you recognize this boy?

792
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:02,333
Not really.

793
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:03,433
It's Charlie.

794
01:05:03,435 --> 01:05:05,168
And who is that?

795
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:07,204
Danny's imaginary friend.

796
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:10,174
Oh, his imaginary friend.
Don't you mean ghost?

797
01:05:10,176 --> 01:05:13,110
Is that what we're
believing in now, is ghosts?

798
01:05:13,112 --> 01:05:14,578
No, damn it, James,
he's not imaginary.

799
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,514
It's true. It's true.

800
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:18,349
The ghosts, honey?

801
01:05:18,351 --> 01:05:20,351
The ghosts are true?

802
01:05:20,353 --> 01:05:22,485
Does my wife
believe in ghosts now?

803
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:24,355
Is that what you're trying
to tell me?

804
01:05:24,357 --> 01:05:25,655
'Cause that's bullshit.

805
01:05:25,657 --> 01:05:28,027
It's bullshit.

806
01:05:31,663 --> 01:05:35,099
I was just downstairs,
and I didn't see a thing.

807
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:37,268
Look, somehow,
he is connected to this house!

808
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:38,436
Tell you what.

809
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:40,503
Giving myself a little bit
of a headache.

810
01:05:40,505 --> 01:05:41,572
I'm gonna go lay down
for a little bit.

811
01:05:41,574 --> 01:05:44,541
Try not to stir up any spooks
until I get back.

812
01:05:44,543 --> 01:05:46,643
James, no,
there's something wrong!

813
01:05:46,645 --> 01:05:50,114
Somehow this house is connected
to the disappearances!

814
01:05:50,116 --> 01:05:52,116
Something is wrong!
Something is very wrong!

815
01:05:52,118 --> 01:05:53,650
- I'll tell you what's wrong!
- And I wanna leave!

816
01:05:53,652 --> 01:05:55,518
It's my crazy fucking wife

817
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,454
who is having psychosis
set in right now

818
01:05:57,456 --> 01:05:59,255
when I'm trying to
have buyers come over!

819
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:00,526
What is wrong with you?!

820
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:07,465
Oh, my God.

821
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:09,036
What is... (yelps)

822
01:06:14,206 --> 01:06:19,175
Get your fucking shit together.

823
01:06:19,177 --> 01:06:20,547
(sobs)

824
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:24,150
Get off of me!

825
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:27,554
Why?!

826
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:02,355
(cell phone dials)

827
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:08,159
God, come on,
pick up the phone.

828
01:07:08,161 --> 01:07:09,626
<i>Hello, this is
Father Donovan O'Malley.</i>

829
01:07:09,628 --> 01:07:11,462
- Hello?
- <i>I'm not available at the moment.</i>

830
01:07:11,464 --> 01:07:13,730
<i>So please leave a message,
and I will get back to you</i>

831
01:07:13,732 --> 01:07:16,534
<i>as soon as I can. Bye.</i>

832
01:07:16,536 --> 01:07:19,335
Father O'Malley, uh...

833
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:21,639
this is Jennifer.

834
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:24,077
And I really need
to talk to you.

835
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:31,118
Oh, my God.

836
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:55,409
Danny, are you okay?

837
01:08:02,248 --> 01:08:03,583
(cell phone dials)

838
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:07,587
<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

839
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:10,820
Hey, girl.

840
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:13,724
Faith, it's so good
to hear your voice.

841
01:08:13,726 --> 01:08:17,494
Listen, um, I need you
to come here to Cedar Rock Falls

842
01:08:17,496 --> 01:08:19,596
and take Danny
for a couple of days, okay?

843
01:08:19,598 --> 01:08:21,498
What's wrong? Are you okay?

844
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,801
I just, uh...
I need to sort some things out.

845
01:08:23,803 --> 01:08:26,670
I'll explain everything
when you get here, all right?

846
01:08:26,672 --> 01:08:28,771
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you need.

847
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:30,373
<i>I'll be there
as fast as I can, okay?</i>

848
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,477
I'll see you soon.

849
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:08,581
Okay.

850
01:09:15,454 --> 01:09:17,555
What about daddy?

851
01:09:17,557 --> 01:09:19,292
He's on his own.

852
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:23,429
(train whistle blows)

853
01:09:43,382 --> 01:09:44,915
Come on, Danny.

854
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:47,486
Father? Excuse me.

855
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:53,357
James and I
have been fighting.

856
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,628
<i>And, uh...</i>

857
01:09:56,462 --> 01:09:57,630
he hit me.

858
01:10:00,566 --> 01:10:02,832
And nothing...
nothing makes sense anymore!

859
01:10:02,834 --> 01:10:04,868
<i>I feel like
I'm losing my mind!</i>

860
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:07,671
It's like I'm seeing things
that aren't there!

861
01:10:07,673 --> 01:10:09,405
They're not real!

862
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,442
I don't know
what's real anymore.

863
01:10:11,444 --> 01:10:12,512
<i>I just...</i>

864
01:10:14,446 --> 01:10:16,248
I have so many questions.

865
01:10:18,918 --> 01:10:21,487
Did you know
about the missing children?

866
01:10:24,356 --> 01:10:25,524
Yes, I did.

867
01:10:40,806 --> 01:10:42,706
I've got something
for you to play with.

868
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:46,710
They taste good, too.
Have one.

869
01:10:46,712 --> 01:10:48,647
And you can build things
with them.

870
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:53,716
Here, right there.

871
01:10:53,718 --> 01:10:55,288
Look at that.

872
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,702
Are you a religious woman,
Jennifer?

873
01:11:11,704 --> 01:11:12,869
Not really.

874
01:11:12,871 --> 01:11:15,939
No?

875
01:11:15,941 --> 01:11:18,408
If you don't believe in God,

876
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:20,913
wait till you see
your first ghost.

877
01:11:24,717 --> 01:11:26,886
You already have,
haven't you?

878
01:11:34,427 --> 01:11:35,661
Look at this.

879
01:11:41,467 --> 01:11:42,733
Oh.

880
01:11:42,735 --> 01:11:44,638
(sighs)

881
01:11:48,441 --> 01:11:50,640
There were nine of them
in total,

882
01:11:50,642 --> 01:11:53,545
the most innocent children
in the purest sense of the word.

883
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:59,550
Well, what does this
have to do with James?

884
01:11:59,552 --> 01:12:01,685
James's mother
was a very sick woman.

885
01:12:01,687 --> 01:12:03,019
James's mother?

886
01:12:03,021 --> 01:12:04,988
Yes.

887
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:06,756
Yeah.

888
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:08,958
Listen, I can't.
Here, please.

889
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,729
Why not?

890
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:14,497
I've been
in purgatory too long.

891
01:12:14,499 --> 01:12:18,469
<i>Its guilt rolls downhill
like an avalanche.</i>

892
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:20,503
The truth shouts,
no matter how long it takes.

893
01:12:20,505 --> 01:12:24,073
We see with our hearts
things that we want to shut out.

894
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:26,743
<i>We go deaf
rather than listen</i>

895
01:12:26,745 --> 01:12:28,845
<i>to things
we don't want to hear.</i>

896
01:12:28,847 --> 01:12:32,049
As a priest, I made a vow
that the spoken sins of others

897
01:12:32,051 --> 01:12:34,484
would never leave
the confessional.

898
01:12:34,486 --> 01:12:36,653
You understand?

899
01:12:36,655 --> 01:12:38,055
For the sake of my family,

900
01:12:38,057 --> 01:12:40,560
I need you tell me
what's going on.

901
01:12:44,763 --> 01:12:47,765
It's all about
your husband James.

902
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:49,936
All of it.

903
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:56,672
<i>James was an angry child.</i>

904
01:12:56,674 --> 01:12:59,411
As a preteen,
James became adept at killing.

905
01:13:00,812 --> 01:13:04,747
<i>First insects,
then small animals.</i>

906
01:13:04,749 --> 01:13:05,784
<i>And then more.</i>

907
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:18,528
He had a good home,
the church, good family.

908
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:20,963
It was very hard
to diagnose anything

909
01:13:20,965 --> 01:13:22,599
in those days.

910
01:13:22,601 --> 01:13:25,935
<i>Henry got him the best doctors
he could afford,</i>

911
01:13:25,937 --> 01:13:27,706
<i>but money can't buy you
everything.</i>

912
01:13:39,118 --> 01:13:41,652
<i>And they insisted
on institutionalizing him</i>

913
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:42,821
<i>to study him.</i>

914
01:13:44,789 --> 01:13:46,024
<i>Nadine wouldn't allow that.</i>

915
01:13:57,169 --> 01:13:58,872
<i>There was an unborn
little brother.</i>

916
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:05,879
<i>He was the first.</i>

917
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:21,628
<i>She told Henry that she had
fallen in the kitchen.</i>

918
01:14:30,936 --> 01:14:33,673
<i>Until one day, he finally
witnessed it himself.</i>

919
01:14:40,646 --> 01:14:44,113
<i>It caused him to retreat
into his own hell.</i>

920
01:14:44,115 --> 01:14:46,049
<i>You see, he knew what
little Jimmy had become</i>

921
01:14:46,051 --> 01:14:47,654
<i>and what he had done.</i>

922
01:14:49,954 --> 01:14:52,591
<i>From there on,
life just took a wrong turn.</i>

923
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:21,087

924
01:15:29,828 --> 01:15:31,998

<i>cleaned up the evidence...</i>

934

<i>and kept him away

<i>as best they could.</i>

936
01:16:20,145 --> 01:16:21,310
It's okay, baby.

937
01:16:21,312 --> 01:16:22,647
I'll take care of it.

938
01:16:26,017 --> 01:16:28,654
<i>They went about their lives

939
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,892
<i>That was the flame

<i>(shovel digging)</i>

01:16:39,798 --> 01:16:41,832
<i>Nadine just kept

<i>out of little Jimmy's clothes.</i>

943

(crying)

944
01:16:45,169 --> 01:16:47,172
<i>And Henry just drank away
his conscience.</i>

945
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:55,778
Come here.

946
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,782
You come here.

947
01:17:34,186 --> 01:17:35,288
You wanna kill something?

948
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:39,958
Kill me.

949
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,801
(crying)

950
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,805
When James was 13,

951
01:17:54,807 --> 01:17:57,239
he got hit
by a hit-and-run driver.

952
01:17:57,241 --> 01:18:00,844
It almost killed him.

953
01:18:00,846 --> 01:18:02,915
He was in a coma for months.

954
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:07,250
When he came
out of the coma,

955
01:18:07,252 --> 01:18:09,853
it was a blessing.

956
01:18:09,855 --> 01:18:11,988
He was a different boy.

957
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:15,024
He didn't remember
the things he had done.

958
01:18:15,026 --> 01:18:18,394
It was redemption.
It was a divine intervention.

959
01:18:18,396 --> 01:18:20,863
I can't.
I can't anymore.

960
01:18:20,865 --> 01:18:23,867
Gave us the opportunity.

961
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:25,004
We sent him
to boarding school.

962
01:18:28,373 --> 01:18:31,277
You need to take Danny and find
a safe place for a while.

963
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,016
Danny!

964
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,016
Come on.

965
01:18:41,018 --> 01:18:44,253
<i>Come on. Come on.
We gotta go</i>

966
01:18:44,255 --> 01:18:45,758
We gotta go.

967
01:18:51,129 --> 01:18:52,798

968
01:19:06,311 --> 01:19:08,781

970
01:20:21,453 --> 01:20:23,252
Woman: <i>Do you remember
last summer?</i>

971
01:20:23,254 --> 01:20:26,088
Man: <i>Up at the lake? I do.</i>

972
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:28,190
Woman: <i>And the summer
right after that?</i>

973
01:20:28,192 --> 01:20:29,525
Man: That was nice.

974
01:20:29,527 --> 01:20:32,561
Woman: <i>Yeah.</i>

975
01:20:32,563 --> 01:20:35,364
Woman:
<i>I think about that</i>

976
01:20:35,366 --> 01:20:38,501
<i>almost every single day.</i>

977
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:42,204
Man: <i>I do, too.
It was great.</i>

978
01:20:42,206 --> 01:20:43,875
<i>You were an angel.</i>

979

984
01:22:00,485 --> 01:22:02,221
<i>Jennifer, is that you?</i>

985
01:22:16,601 --> 01:22:18,435
No.

986
01:22:18,437 --> 01:22:21,140
Oh, it's you.

987
01:22:26,378 --> 01:22:29,115
Your timing is impeccable.

988
01:22:32,383 --> 01:22:36,618
Seeing you the other day
brought back some fond memories.

989
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:40,556
Some not so fond.

990
01:22:40,558 --> 01:22:45,694
Amnesia.
It's a double-edged sword.

991
01:22:45,696 --> 01:22:49,399
Your memories must be
flooding back like waves...

992
01:22:49,401 --> 01:22:52,502
some of them frightening.

993
01:22:52,504 --> 01:22:53,603
Some?

994
01:22:53,605 --> 01:22:56,271
All of them.

995
01:22:56,273 --> 01:22:57,607
You...

996
01:22:57,609 --> 01:23:01,443
you were born...

997
01:23:01,445 --> 01:23:05,148
without empathy,

998
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:08,283
and I am really sorry
for that. So sorry.

999
01:23:08,285 --> 01:23:10,552
Yeah, really?

1000
01:23:10,554 --> 01:23:13,189
<i>(mockingly)
You're so sorry.</i>

1001
01:23:13,191 --> 01:23:18,360
You think sorry
is gonna fix any of this?

1002
01:23:18,362 --> 01:23:21,564
You really think sorry
is enough?

1003
01:23:21,566 --> 01:23:24,400
You've caused so much pain...

1004
01:23:24,402 --> 01:23:27,269
so much misery.

1005
01:23:27,271 --> 01:23:28,637
There will be
no forgiveness for you,

1006
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,439
not in this world.

1007
01:23:30,441 --> 01:23:32,475
Well, for once,
we actually agree.

1008
01:23:32,477 --> 01:23:35,577
(sighs)

1009
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:38,550
So, where do we go
from here?

1010
01:23:41,386 --> 01:23:44,490
<i>Because the problem is
you knew.</i>

1011
01:23:47,225 --> 01:23:51,560
All along,
you knew what I was doing.

1012
01:23:51,562 --> 01:23:54,100
<i>And you knew what I had done.</i>

1013
01:23:57,602 --> 01:23:59,338

<i>Did you tell her?</i>

1016
01:24:10,315 --> 01:24:11,413
Yes.

1017
01:24:11,415 --> 01:24:13,616
Wh...

1018
01:24:13,618 --> 01:24:15,618
what am I supposed to do now?

1019
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,720
James...

1020
01:24:17,722 --> 01:24:18,787
<i>Mother should have
had me committed.</i>

1021
01:24:18,789 --> 01:24:22,225
She could have done something.
Fucking something!

1022
01:24:22,227 --> 01:24:25,260
You all
are just as guilty as I am

1023
01:24:25,262 --> 01:24:27,663
because you knew!
You fucking knew!

1024
01:24:27,665 --> 01:24:29,631
And you didn't even do
a God damn thing!

1025
01:24:29,633 --> 01:24:31,400
I made a vow.

1026
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:34,470
<i>A promise.</i>

1027
01:24:34,472 --> 01:24:36,405
Well, you can't
let a bad thing get in the way

01:24:36,407 --> 01:24:38,308
of a good thing, right?

1029
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:40,212
<i>Right, Father?</i>

You're picking it up right
