1
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:37,889
Can't you go a little faster,

2
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,929
I'm gonna be fucking late.

3
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,291
Relax, we'll be there.

4
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,492
I'm going as fast as I can pal,

5
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:44,981
don't have a heart attack.

6
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:45,815
It's like 20 minutes.

7
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:46,979
- 20 minutes?

8
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,980
You alright?

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,189
- I just can't be late to this.

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,120
I'm getting out.

11
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,470
Pull over, I'm getting out.

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,181
- Ah jeez.

13
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,008
Hey, it's Chubby.

14
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,009
Chubby!

15
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,526
Have a seat.

16
00:01:58,838 --> 00:02:00,171
- You want cake?

17
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,276
- Hey she asked if
I'm ready for my cake.

18
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:11,584
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake.

19
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:16,043
Cake, cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake.

20
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:19,961
Cake, cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake.

21
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,870
- Tell your boss what
happened here today.

22
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,793
Make nothing up,
leave nothing out.

23
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,360
My part of the deal is
done, not it's his turn.

24
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,580
- Hey.

25
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,469
- So what do you
want for dinner?

26
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,340
I'm cooking.

27
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,330
Really?

28
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,473
What's the occasion?

29
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:49,423
- I just feel like it.

30
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:53,192
You not going out tonight?

31
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:56,993
- Nah, they want me to but
I don't really feel like it.

32
00:07:58,138 --> 00:07:59,138
It's been a long week.

33
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,590
- You're not still
moping over Rob are you?

34
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,949
- No, I'm done with him.

35
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,953
I just feel like
staying in, that's all.

36
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,429
- You're sure
nothing's going on.

37
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,039
Nothing is going on.

38
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,319
I am offering you
fresh cooked food.

39
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,393
Dutiful Asian daughter
and all that shit.

40
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,303
What's not to like?

41
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,083
- Okay, let me think.

42
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,793
- Do you want me out?

43
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,585
- What do you mean?

44
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,999
- Ooh is somebody
coming over maybe?

45
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Is that it?

46
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,410
- No.

47
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,509
- Oh, that's disappointing.

48
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,807
I never want you to use me as
an excuse not to, you know.

49
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,830
What?

50
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,783
- Bring someone home
with you, that you like.

51
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,749
- It's been a long week too.

52
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,750
Let's make dinner.

53
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,179
- Don't forget we have the
councilor meeting on Monday.

54
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
You bet.

55
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,760
- We still can't tell them
you're really my uncle?

56
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,050
- You know the drill.

57
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,329
- Alright, I just think
it'd be cool that's all.

58
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,323
It would make me more exotic.

59
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,419
You're a gorgeous,
young Korean American.

60
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,349
Piano virtuoso getting a full
scholarship to Juilliard.

61
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,399
And a multiple black belt.

62
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,139
You wanna be more exotic?

63
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,779
- Boring, boring, boring.

64
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,370
You want some tea?

65
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,371
- Yeah.

66
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:31,676
Jaime?

67
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:44,549
Jaime!

68
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:12,899
Dono?

69
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,363
What the hell is this?

70
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
- Hey Jack.

71
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:19,675
Long time no see.

72
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:22,594
How you been?

73
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,070
- Good.

74
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
How about you?

75
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,053
- Day started off good.

76
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,693
Had a really great
dump this morning.

77
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,300
- Where did they take her?

78
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,193
- I'm just a soldier
man, you know that.

79
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,403
- I know your Michael's guy.

80
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,290
Where?

81
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:03,360
- If I tell you
Michael kills me.

82
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:09,053
- That's right, what's the code?

83
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,537
You fail, you die.

84
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,483
Michael will kill you, slow.

85
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,583
I'll make it quick.

86
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,890
I liked you.

87
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:33,809
You used to make me laugh.

88
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,810
- Jesus Jack.

89
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,020
You worked for Michael once.

90
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,600
What do you expect me to do?

91
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:44,587
- Come on.

92
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Go on.

93
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,173
Say it.

94
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:54,300
- Don's Restaurant 18th
and Harrison, in the city.

95
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,557
Talk to me.

96
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,276
- Put Michael on.

97
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:27,209
Who the fuck is this?

98
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,057
- Jack Lee, put him on.

99
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,519
Dono, I hope you
ain't fucking with me.

100
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,693
- Why'd you take Jaime?

101
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,199
Jack.

102
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
- We had a deal.

103
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,129
A deal, right.

104
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,419
Well the deal on the premise

105
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,023
that your brother in
laws death was permanent.

106
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:47,713
- It can't be.

107
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:49,699
Oh a beautiful place

108
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,679
he's got down there in
Florida, right on the coast.

109
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,199
You know you can see all
the oil spills in the Gulf

110
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
right from his desk.

111
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,488
Five million can buy an
awful lot of property,

112
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,834
so tell me, why didn't
you get one yourself.

113
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,673
- I didn't know,
I wasn't in on it.

114
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:09,519
Who do you think
you're talking to?

115
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,188
I know you guys weren't
the tightest but come on,

116
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,442
you were married to
his fucking sister.

117
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:17,559
You know that was a beautiful
plan that you come with.

118
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,626
You fooled me.

119
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,956
I mean you really fooled me.

120
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:21,863
- Why Jaime?

121
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:22,939
She's got nothing
to do with this.

122
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,832
I'm out five million and
I need some merchandise

123
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,859
to sell to recover that.

124
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,453
Something of great value.

125
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,460
- I made it square with you.

126
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,963
I hit Z for you.

127
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,949
That settled it.

128
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,089
You made it square
for Harry stealing

129
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,429
five million from me.

130
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,329
Money I thought was lost.

131
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,093
But since he faked his
death, all deals are off.

132
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,969
And the both of
you are gonna pay.

133
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,170
The pay being different.

134
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,087
- You want ransom?

135
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,251
How much?

136
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,059
Oh this is much
bigger than that.

137
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,283
Just know that she'll
be taken care of.

138
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,713
In very good hands, we
can promise you that.

139
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:04,060
- You deal with me!

140
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,811
You don't take Jaime!

141
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,506
- A professional hit.

142
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:21,507
And they lost.

143
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,459
Koehler here yet?

144
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
- Don't think so.

145
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,829
- Is he coming?

146
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,080
I don't wanna have to
repeat anything to him.

147
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,529
I know I have to work with him,

148
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,833
I am just tired
of always waiting.

149
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:44,659
Did they find out
who lives here?

150
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,949
- Father and daughter.

151
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,499
Asian, kept to
themselves the most part.

152
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,769
Only thing a noise complaint
a couple of years ago.

153
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,669
Turns out it was a sweet
sixteen for the daughter

154
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,259
and some of her friends.

155
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,129
You know, normal stuff.

156
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,593
Do we know where they are?

157
00:16:58,527 --> 00:16:59,659
- I don't know.

158
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,983
- Never fear the FBI is here.

159
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,283
Okay, let's get this
show on the road.

160
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,283
We haven't met, Hap
Koehler, Special Agent FBI.

161
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,563
Detective Ashley Jordan,

162
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,940
how are you this fine evening?

163
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,739
I want a full report.

164
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,359
- Three dead.

165
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,819
- Neighbor saw a car
leaving the garage

166
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,103
after all this went down.

167
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,773
- Call in an APB.

168
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,550
- Yes sir.

169
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,523
- Well, well, well
what have we got here?

170
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,543
- Plenty here is your caretaker.

171
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,407
You be nice to him,
he'll be nice to you.

172
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:51,517
You piss him off, he'll
hurt you, got that?

173
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,870
- Got it.

174
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:56,479
- I'm not talking to you.

175
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
You hear me?

176
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,513
- I'm not stupid.

177
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,819
I'm not gonna get
my head blown off

178
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,643
by one of you motherfuckers.

179
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:10,133
I don't know where I am,

180
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,493
I don't know how the
fuck to get out of here.

181
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,653
So I'll do what you want.

182
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,763
I'll obey, I'll be compliant.

183
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,683
Except for just one thing.

184
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:29,729
If you try to rape me,
I will fucking kill you

185
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,909
in any way that I can,

186
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,399
and I won't care what
happens to me after it!

187
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,439
And if you hurt me, you kill me,

188
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,049
my Uncle Jack will make sure
that you live long enough

189
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,873
to see your heart ripped
from your own chest.

190
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:45,963
Okay.

191
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,663
- Jesus Christ.

192
00:18:57,829 --> 00:18:58,780
White Honda has been spotted.

193
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:03,243
License plate Alpha Omega
Charlie Eighth Six Eight.

194
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:06,939
Repeat Alpha Omega
Charlie Eighth Six Eight.

195
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,849
Okay we have 42 coming out

196
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,137
over the hit and run
you might wait for him.

197
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:13,305
Will do.

198
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,649
- I know this guy.

199
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,089
Dono Marro, one of
Michael Banducci's men.

200
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,090
- You sure?

201
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,603
- Been tracking him since the
first day I got this case.

202
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,367
That means everyone else
here is a Banducci man.

203
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
That's good.

204
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,179
I can clean out my database,

205
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,827
it was getting pretty cluttered.

206
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:42,047
Suspect is in custody.

207
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,582
480 at Douglas,
permission to 20 flash.

208
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,155
North on two-one we got this.

209
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:48,072
10 six.

210
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,459
- I'll make you a bet.

211
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,219
Ballistics will match
every weapon in there

212
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,649
with a bullet in
each of those bodies.

213
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,389
And those bodies will be found
to be the owners of the guns.

214
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,649
- Meaning?

215
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,900
- You're intrigued right?

216
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,130
- Meaning?

217
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,739
- Meaning, maybe we should

218
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,013
discuss this case
further over drinks?

219
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:19,511
Koehler.

220
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,309
Ash!

221
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,393
Patrol car found
our man in the city.

222
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,779
- Fuck this jurisdiction shit.

223
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,699
I am sick of your goddamn
political bullshit.

224
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
- You need to calm down.

225
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,129
- We are not your
fucking lackeys.

226
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,819
We led you to Bendu Chief,

227
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,479
we gave you all his
locations, all his contacts,

228
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,849
all his bank accounts,

229
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,879
you took it and you put it in
your precious little database

230
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,619
and you keep taking
all the credit for it.

231
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,726
And I am sick of it.

232
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:04,309
You can't have him.

233
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,969
- We're on this together.

234
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,069
We're the ones
with the resources.

235
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,356
You got a safe house
where we can take him?

236
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:10,659
- Yes it's called jail.

237
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,660
- Oh jee.

238
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,998
You're way out of line,
you know that lady?

239
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,830
I think maybe you
need some time off.

240
00:21:20,052 --> 00:21:22,102
You can force for me
to pull rank on you.

241
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,493
I can throw you off this
case, is that what you want?

242
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,409
Look, we take him
to a safe house,

243
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,739
you're there with us and
I'll debrief you on Jack Lee.

244
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,339
Trust me detective.

245
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,670
You have no idea what
you're up against here.

246
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:40,738
What's your answer?

247
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,470
- Do it.

248
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:29,037
- I tell you, she's like that
girl from The Exorcist movie.

249
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:30,718
I was waiting for the
green gunk in my eye.

250
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,327
- What are you
getting soft on me?

251
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:34,578
She's 17 for Christ sake.

252
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,959
- We've got her no
problem, and cops got Jack,

253
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,163
can you believe that?

254
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:44,259
We watched the whole bust
out of the front window.

255
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,289
- Yeah, we'll deal
with that next.

256
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,139
Who's watching her now?

257
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,340
- Testo and The Machine.

258
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:55,373
- The heat got Jack right
outside our fucking door.

259
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,739
They're gonna be
back to look around.

260
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,789
Have them take her
to the warehouse

261
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,823
and babysit until
we get there okay?

262
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,099
- Done.

263
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
- What's the code?

264
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:10,299
- Failure is not an option.

265
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,650
- Now say it the right way.

266
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,553
- You fail, you die.

267
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,829
- Okay, next item on the agenda.

268
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,830
- What agenda?

269
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,674
- Jack.

270
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:26,080
- Oh, we'll get him.

271
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:35,243
- SFPD owns him now, unless
he does something about it.

272
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,503
If you want him, you've
gotta go through them first.

273
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,967
Yeah I thought so.

274
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,593
It's time you met somebody.

275
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:49,748
Pull the car around.

276
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:23,019
- What is it a Chinese
medicine or something?

277
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,553
- Patience trust me.

278
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:56,909
Michael Banducci, enter Senor.

279
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,360
- Thank you, good to see you.

280
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:00,284
- Please.

281
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,613
My nephews Alejandro,
Diego, my sisters sons.

282
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:11,669
They've come into the business.

283
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,569
- We have not needed
your special services

284
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,459
in quite a while
now as my business

285
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,629
has been stable and growing.

286
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,430
- I take it a
pleasure to hear that.

287
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,559
I'm sorry things are
different now huh?

288
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,160
- A single issue only and
you can help me with that.

289
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,013
I want only the best you have
to offer, as we will need it.

290
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,843
- Consider the
fee paid, in full.

291
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,380
As it happens the best is
here with us as we are speak.

292
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,367
Let me introduce Diego to you.

293
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,383
My nephew, a Navy Seal.

294
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,073
Can you believe it?

295
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:15,713
- I feel better now,
we're in good hands.

296
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,590
You hungry?

297
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,183
- Sure.

298
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:20,183
- What do you feel like?

299
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:23,459
- Oh let's see we had
Italian last night.

300
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,119
- How about, I
don't know, Chinese.

301
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,570
- Yes sure, that sounds good.

302
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,690
What?

303
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,673
- Think back, six years now.

304
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:43,319
A little job I sent
you on for a client.

305
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,696
You were there only to
report what you saw,

306
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:47,297
as an objective and
trusted third party.

307
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,571
Do you recall this?

308
00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:58,844
Tell me everything you
remember of that night,

309
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:00,178
can you do that?

310
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:03,903
- Yes.

311
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,823
I remember everything, as
if it were just yesterday.

312
00:27:12,455 --> 00:27:14,213
I wish I could just forget.

313
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,830
- Open the door.

314
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,156
- I always open it.

315
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:32,357
- Open the fucking door.

316
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:43,343
That'll teach you, you
little fucking cunt.

317
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,330
Where you going
to run to now huh?

318
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:07,483
- Hey babe, it's
your favorite girl.

319
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,618
I'm maybe 20 miles out.

320
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,062
- Can y'all see me
from your station?

321
00:29:20,063 --> 00:29:20,896
10 four.

322
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:22,303
- I could head over
later, that is,

323
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:24,439
if you're not doing anything.

324
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
- Johnson.

325
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:28,919
Go ahead.

326
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
- Stay there.

327
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:32,121
Copy that.

328
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:33,372
- See you soon, love you.

329
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,009
- Six years ago, the gang boss
known as Z was muscling in on

330
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,723
Michael Banducci's
territory and operations.

331
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,519
On the night of July 7th,
they shut him down, hard.

332
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,829
All the bullets and casings

333
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,499
that were harvested
from the crime scene

334
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,289
matched the weapons
of all of the victims.

335
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,609
On that alone it
would appear that

336
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,319
they just decided to kill
themselves for the hell of it.

337
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,057
It must've been a pretty
lousy birthday party.

338
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,169
Banducci arranged the
hit, that's a no brainer.

339
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,899
But there's never been any
evidence to link him to it.

340
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,649
The case went very
cold, very fast

341
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,919
and it's stayed
that way ever since.

342
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,799
Then last night,

343
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,483
when I saw what went down
at the home of Jack Lee,

344
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:24,779
I recognized something

345
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,229
that I hadn't seen
since the Z killings.

346
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,929
The victims weapons were all
taken and turned upon 'em.

347
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,103
All of the victims
were Banducci's men.

348
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,769
Shortly thereafter
we picked up Jack Lee

349
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,589
casing Don's Restaurant.

350
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,369
A front for Banducci
run by his ace boon goon

351
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,293
Dimitri Don Orloff.

352
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,050
Can you feel it?

353
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,283
Yeah, we can feel it.

354
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,769
- Yeah.

355
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,279
Jack Lee is sitting in there

356
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,169
waiting for us to have
a conversation with him.

357
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,699
If he's a $25,000 a
year security guard,

358
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,829
I'm the Shah Of Iran.

359
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,099
We get him to tell us

360
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,863
that Banducci hired him to do
the Z hit, we can prosecute.

361
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,703
I've waited six
years for this, okay.

362
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:28,559
You're welcome to
stay if you want

363
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,479
but there's not really
anything for you to do.

364
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,780
I'll keep you updated
on any new developments.

365
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,863
- I wanna review the photos,
is that okay with you?

366
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,367
- Passwords ghost,
all lowercase.

367
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,603
- I'm not here to
interrogate you.

368
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,100
Where's your daughter?

369
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:00,621
No tricks.

370
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:07,689
I am just honestly concerned.

371
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,230
- What are you doing?

372
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,939
You are here at my
sole discretion.

373
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,472
Do we need to have that
discussion about jurisdiction.

374
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,175
- Do you have a car?

375
00:33:42,176 --> 00:33:43,033
- Yes.

376
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:44,105
- Front or back?

377
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,106
- Front.

378
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:47,527
Let's go.

379
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,369
Drop to the ground.

380
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,379
Drop to the ground!

381
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,737
On the ground now, hands spread.

382
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,012
The snipers on the East Side.

383
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:01,599
- What are you doing?

384
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,373
I'll draw 'em out,
if you're quick.

385
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:25,769
- There's a hospital 10
minutes away from here.

386
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,284
- No.

387
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:29,950
They found me here,
they'll find me there.

388
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:31,153
- You need to let me go.

389
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:33,071
- I have to find Jaime.

390
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:35,898
- Then she is alive?

391
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,850
- I die, she dies.

392
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:46,012
I'll tell you everything
you wanna know,

393
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,347
I'll give you Banducci.

394
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:49,348
Give him up.

395
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:52,868
- Come on, come on, let's go.

396
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:41,762
- Hi there, welcome.

397
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:44,089
- Good to see you
again Tashir son.

398
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,109
- If you'll excuse me.

399
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,110
- Okay.

400
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,749
You've kept me on the hook
for quite a while now.

401
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,269
- What do you mean?

402
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,269
- My warehouse, my
entire operations,

403
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,279
you know the work of it.

404
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,623
My offer still stands.

405
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:01,193
My retirements calling
to me louder every day.

406
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:02,027
- I've been following
your growth,

407
00:37:02,028 --> 00:37:03,730
as if I've always
been an investor.

408
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,459
- Well I'm flattered.

409
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,169
You would've seen an excellent
return on your investment.

410
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,709
- I have particular appreciated
your escort services.

411
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,579
Executive class all the way.

412
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,626
- Thank you.

413
00:37:14,627 --> 00:37:17,399
- And I'm also very impressed
by your shipping operations.

414
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,205
You've become the Fed Ex of
the contraband haven't you?

415
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:23,049
Then you know the
worth of my operation.

416
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,919
- Indeed, and it would supplement
my activities really well.

417
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,509
Your price has always
been reasonable

418
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,478
and I will pay when
I am ready too,

419
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,829
but I am not yet ready.

420
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,663
- Well I may have something

421
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:34,313
that will make you
feel you are ready.

422
00:37:35,396 --> 00:37:36,709
- I'm intrigued.

423
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,185
- Six years ago when you were

424
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:39,679
just starting your
trafficking operation

425
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,199
and wanted girls of
distinction, I offered you one.

426
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,559
- She was Korean and
very young wasn't she?

427
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,129
- That's right.

428
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,429
Long story short, she
became a bargain chip

429
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,714
to another problem I had
and that chip has been used.

430
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:53,699
- Have you found one
of the same caliber?

431
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,200
- Actually, it's the same one.

432
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,609
She's back on the
market and as I recall

433
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,719
you don't like to pick
prematurely from the vine,

434
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,735
you appreciate a fruit
that had time to ripen.

435
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:06,569
- You have a good memory.

436
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,103
- Well she's 17 now and she's
become a very fine wine.

437
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,779
- And has the
bottle been opened?

438
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,339
- I would assume
so, kids these days,

439
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,357
but the bottle is full.

440
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:19,149
- I presumed she has
not yet been bargained.

441
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,493
- No she has not and I warn
you, she's wild, extremely so.

442
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:26,185
- That's a, this might
indeed close our deal.

443
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:28,349
- I'd like to arrange a
showing at your convenience,

444
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,593
I'm supremely confident
you'll be very pleased.

445
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,254
- Your offer is most generous,

446
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:36,523
I shall be pursuing this matter.

447
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:39,324
- Well consider it a bonus
and my gift to seal the deal.

448
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,330
It's looking really good.

449
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,679
Figure out where
you'd like to live

450
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,540
for the rest of your life,

451
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,409
maybe a tropical island
someplace like that.

452
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,279
Someplace you can
park your yacht.

453
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,493
You know, your smaller yacht.

454
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,839
Okay, unfinished business,

455
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,699
where did San Testaban say?

456
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,309
- Well he's making noises
that we didn't tell him

457
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,267
it wasn't just Jack.

458
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:30,723
- It was just Jack.

459
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,409
- Turns out there was another
person they had to fight too.

460
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,839
- So fucking what?

461
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,113
- The contract says one.

462
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,199
- Bullshit.

463
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,713
Alright we've gotta
send him a message.

464
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,887
What's his cousins name?

465
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:46,669
- Nephew, Diego.

466
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,969
- Whatever.

467
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,259
I want you to find him,
slap him around a bit,

468
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,079
leave some marks.

469
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,739
Send him back to
Testaban with a message

470
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,339
that I expect this
work to be completed

471
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,140
or we've got a very
serious problem.

472
00:40:00,617 --> 00:40:01,617
- Done.

473
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,093
Ash, he's awake.

474
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,473
- Jack, can you hear me?

475
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,340
- Where the hell am I?

476
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,609
My brother Oliver's house.

477
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,810
He's taking care of you.

478
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:36,079
- Your brother?

479
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
- Adopted.

480
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,639
- How long?

481
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,279
- Well since the
orphanage and then I came,

482
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,583
oh, about two days.

483
00:40:48,063 --> 00:40:49,849
No, you can't, no good.

484
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,260
You've gotta stay
flat as a board.

485
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,306
- Rest now, you're
in good hands.

486
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,319
- Are you comfortable?

487
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Taken care of?

488
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,609
- Yes.

489
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,649
- Look, we got off
on the wrong foot,

490
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,963
but you've been behaving,
I'd like to reward that.

491
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,407
Do you remember me?

492
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:54,373
You were about so.

493
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,409
Cute as a bud.

494
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,279
Already a real looker.

495
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,699
Your father worked
for me back then,

496
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,293
I mean your real father Harry.

497
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:06,990
Call me Uncle Michael,
I'd like that.

498
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,662
- Okay, Uncle Michael.

499
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:16,197
- Now Jaime you like
nice clothes don't you?

500
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:21,119
Oh then you're just gonna
love what we've got for you.

501
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,329
You do as you're told, everyone
has an enjoyable evening

502
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,689
and we see about
getting you back home

503
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,629
safe and sound to Uncle Jack.

504
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,057
How's the sound?

505
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:29,900
- What do you want me to do?

506
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:31,549
- Oh no, no, no,
nothing like that.

507
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,889
I can find plenty
of girls to put out.

508
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,750
I just need you to be a
beautiful, charming hostess

509
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,043
to impress a very important guy.

510
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:42,983
Can you do that
for Uncle Michael?

511
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,580
- Okay.

512
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,330
- Terrific.

513
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,609
See that?

514
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,709
Kill 'em with kindness and they
eat right out of your hand.

515
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,879
Bitches are all the same.

516
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,560
- Did you mean what
you said in there?

517
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:21,763
Are you gonna let her go?

518
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,299
- What the fuck do you
think I'm gonna do?

519
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,869
- Well, I dunno, I
figured maybe like...

520
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,499
- I swear, the next guy I hire
has to be a college graduate,

521
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,063
I can't take this shit anymore.

522
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:43,579
- Man, his ass is so tight

523
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,023
only frogs in Peru
could hear him fart.

524
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,563
Come on Jack just
a little further.

525
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,990
- Outside.

526
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:03,379
- No man, this window's gonna
be all the outside you get.

527
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,380
Come on.

528
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,629
He's got about an hour
until his next pain meds

529
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,530
and then he's gonna
probably pass out.

530
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,760
- Are you ready for
some show and tell?

531
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,499
Koehler kept everything
about Banducci on this.

532
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,193
I've had the last few
days to figure it all out.

533
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,083
Who is Harry Mason?

534
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,059
I've helped you no?

535
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,343
And we had a deal.

536
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,490
- Yes you have.

537
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:06,875
- Your brother in law?

538
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,907
You may not like what I'm
going to show you next.

539
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,863
Did you know?

540
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:26,253
Harry Mason was married
to Alexa Lee, your sister.

541
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,563
She's deceased?

542
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,789
- Car accident.

543
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:32,790
- Suspicious?

544
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,580
- Drinking problem.

545
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,629
- They had a daughter, Alicia,

546
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,209
she disappeared right
after Harry's death.

547
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,949
No trace.

548
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,283
She's Jaime isn't she?

549
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,163
Tell me about this.

550
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,159
Harry kept the books for
the Banducci operations.

551
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,489
Over several years
he siphoned off

552
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:02,993
five million and disappeared.

553
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:06,499
Banducci grabbed Jaime as
leverage against Harry,

554
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,634
he figured he'd only
come back for her.

555
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:10,817
He didn't.

556
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:12,539
A month later it looked
like Harry bought it

557
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,029
in an arm's heist gone wrong.

558
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,406
Big explosion.

559
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,714
Lots of blood.

560
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:21,211
They ID'd Harry by
some loose teeth.

561
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:23,662
After than Banducci had
no more use for the girl.

562
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,417
He would've killed
or trafficked her.

563
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,179
I made a deal to get her back.

564
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,493
- You hit Z, take out his
rival, he gives you Jaime?

565
00:46:38,076 --> 00:46:39,776
Banducci kept his
end of the deal?

566
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:46,463
- We disappeared, Jaime
picked a new name.

567
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,673
Those were good times.

568
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:57,950
A second chance.

569
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,119
Then they found
Harry still alive,

570
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,120
Michael thought I knew.

571
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,500
I didn't.

572
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,880
I thought he was dead too.

573
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:12,923
After all these years.

574
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,900
- What's happening?

575
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:41,823
- She's worried.

576
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,713
Just trying to work it
out for herself you know.

577
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,298
- So am I.

578
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,170
- I think it's you.

579
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,789
She says your some kind of

580
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,673
ninja, assassin,
killer, hitman, dude.

581
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,313
She said you saved her life.

582
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,790
- She saved mine.

583
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:16,820
- Did she tell you,
I'm not a doctor.

584
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,579
- What the hell are you?

585
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,639
- I'm a veterinarian.

586
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,493
Horses and dogs mostly.

587
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:28,863
- Oh shit.

588
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:30,119
- Don't worry man,

589
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,853
I learned the same shit as
those people stitchers did.

590
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,173
Hey, hey man watch it.

591
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:53,897
You don't know what
you're missing dude.

592
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,230
- I like this gun.

593
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,500
Fits my hand like
it's molded for it.

594
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,283
Koehler had good taste.

595
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,319
- You never come with a weapon,

596
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,000
so nothing can be traced to you.

597
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:56,563
- And nothing can ever
be taken away from me.

598
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,273
- You have to know how
to use every weapon.

599
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,029
- In my line, whether
you live or die

600
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,680
depends on your
weapon of choice.

601
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,513
Can I get my phone back?

602
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,120
It's the only way
Jaime can reach me.

603
00:53:27,387 --> 00:53:30,417
- I found it in Koehler's
case, I'll give it to you.

604
00:53:32,234 --> 00:53:33,234
- Thank you.

605
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:44,754
- Alright what happened?

606
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,219
- It got a little out of hand.

607
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,053
- I didn't tell you
to kill the fucker.

608
00:53:47,054 --> 00:53:48,718
Slap him around is
what I said, okay.

609
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:49,680
- That's exactly
what I was doing.

610
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:50,989
He knew the rules.
- Oh Christ.

611
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:51,883
- Put the weapons down.

612
00:53:51,884 --> 00:53:53,559
Then he pulls a blade.

613
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,579
- You're bringing the
heat on us, you know that?

614
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,549
- Only his brother knows,
he ain't going talk.

615
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,199
- What am I gonna
say to San Testaban?

616
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,859
This Diego was his cousin.

617
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,809
- Nephew.
- Whatever!

618
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,159
There's a big fat
fucking difference

619
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,769
between slapping a guy
around and putting him down.

620
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,094
- He came at me for the kill.

621
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:10,080
- Hmm-mm.

622
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,730
Him with a knife,
you with a gun.

623
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,960
Was there something
going on between you two?

624
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,009
- I caught Candy
with him at the club.

625
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,123
So we had a little altercation.

626
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,169
His big brother stopped
us from settling things,

627
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,503
so things ain't settled
if you know what I mean.

628
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:35,169
- That's it?

629
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,999
He was taking home one of
your stripper girlfriends?

630
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,269
- She was special.

631
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,449
- I bet she was.

632
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,489
Not like the others.

633
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:41,829
- That's right.

634
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,129
- She fooled you.

635
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,139
- What?

636
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,559
- You're a bonehead, but
you're not that stupid.

637
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,660
I was fucking her too.

638
00:54:50,481 --> 00:54:54,589
Was there anything
else going on?

639
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,840
- I was doing his
girlfriend too, that's all.

640
00:54:58,668 --> 00:54:59,668
- Ah Jesus.

641
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:03,391
- I didn't know she was
his girlfriend at the time.

642
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,520
Alright yeah, I knew.

643
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:11,064
- Hmm, goddammit.

644
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,740
- For me?

645
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:43,896
- It should fit.

646
00:55:46,258 --> 00:55:47,925
How are you feeling?

647
00:55:50,043 --> 00:55:52,257
- A thousand times
better than yesterday.

648
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,139
- My grandfather always
used to say afternoon naps

649
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,139
killed everything
except an appetite.

650
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,163
It should be ready
in about 15 minutes.

651
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,800
- Where are we going?

652
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,053
Am I under arrest?

653
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,379
- Sure, why not.

654
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,359
I always let someone
in my custody

655
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,239
run straight into sniper fire

656
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,393
and then I follow guns blazing.

657
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,239
- It works every time.

658
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,303
- You were hit.

659
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,163
- Only once, thanks to you.

660
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,240
Thank you.

661
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,383
- You're not under arrest.

662
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,093
Because I'm not a cop anymore.

663
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,579
I stopped being a cop

664
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,580
when we drove away
from the crime scene.

665
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,803
It was a long time coming.

666
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,100
Why did you?

667
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,183
- I didn't dislike Koehler
because he was such a doofus,

668
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,943
I was burned out
and he could see.

669
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,963
And I hated that he
knew that about me.

670
00:57:50,222 --> 00:57:51,222
- What will you do now?

671
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,227
- Finish making dinner.

672
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,773
After that, anybody's guess.

673
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,863
If I wasn't a cop,

674
00:58:15,413 --> 00:58:18,053
I would've loved to have
been a ballroom dancer.

675
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:23,409
- May I have this dance?

676
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,997
I can dance to this too.

677
00:59:16,396 --> 00:59:17,563
- Can you now?

678
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,200
- I failed her.

679
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,860
I failed at being a good father.

680
01:00:39,189 --> 01:00:42,272
- The last six years
prove different.

681
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,450
We found him.

682
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:52,545
Confirmed it's them.

683
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:54,713
What do you want us to do?

684
01:00:55,997 --> 01:00:56,997
Check.

685
01:01:50,546 --> 01:01:51,546
- Jack!

686
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,140
Who sent you?

687
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:38,303
If you wanna live you talk.

688
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,323
Who sent you?

689
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,013
- San Testaban.

690
01:03:48,441 --> 01:03:51,149
Working with Banducci?

691
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,150
- Don't know.

692
01:03:54,102 --> 01:03:55,289
I'm just a soldier.

693
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,290
Of course.

694
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,123
Where is San
Testaban these days?

695
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,353
- Alright, alright.

696
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:30,893
88 Grant, Chinatown.

697
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,130
What's San Testaban's
connection to Banducci?

698
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:43,910
- He's freelance.

699
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,133
Custom services.

700
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,700
No loyalty.

701
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:55,679
He'll take a job for anyone
as long as money's right.

702
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,749
- You've met him?

703
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:59,769
- No, but I've heard of him.

704
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,579
He's a recluse.

705
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:04,089
But he's got his
hands in everything.

706
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:05,959
The FBI have used
his service before.

707
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,599
It explains how they found
us at the safe house.

708
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,433
I'll go alone.

709
01:05:09,434 --> 01:05:10,889
- I'm going with you.

710
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:12,049
- I'm faster alone.

711
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,229
- I'm not asking permission.

712
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,649
I'll keep up, deal?

713
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:15,709
- I can't worry about you.

714
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,570
- Don't.

715
01:05:16,571 --> 01:05:18,570
- Tie him up, even
if his arm falls off.

716
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,310
- I'm proud of you brother.

717
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,140
- Hey man.

718
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,717
You into weed at all?

719
01:05:58,144 --> 01:06:00,061
- 72 Chevy Nova 350 38.

720
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,720
- It's my baby.

721
01:06:08,238 --> 01:06:12,380
Upgraded it's cam intake,
the carb, dual exhaust.

722
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:16,690
- Sweet.

723
01:06:24,155 --> 01:06:26,822
Where have you been all my life?

724
01:06:28,853 --> 01:06:30,381
- Waiting for you.

725
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,399
- Get all the regulars
out of here by one.

726
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,250
Given them their bonuses

727
01:07:17,251 --> 01:07:19,669
and tell 'em the boss is real
happy with their productivity.

728
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,746
- Okay, I'll tell 'em.

729
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:22,640
- Tashir's gonna
be here at three,

730
01:07:22,641 --> 01:07:25,940
so if she decides to act
up today you deal with her.

731
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:26,959
And no messing
her up in any way.

732
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,289
No cuts, no bruises, no
black eyes, you got it?

733
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:31,290
- Say what?

734
01:07:34,887 --> 01:07:37,499
- I've been keeping you
in the loop haven't I?

735
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,659
Tashir is our cash cow

736
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,049
and he's about to make
you very, very rich.

737
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,229
I've been trying to make
this deal with him forever.

738
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,562
And now we finally got the
sweetener that's gonna close it.

739
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,113
Our beautiful little honey pot.

740
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,539
On paper it's gonna look like

741
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:53,362
just another legitimate
real estate deal,

742
01:07:53,363 --> 01:07:56,439
but what he's getting is my
entire fucking operation.

743
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,653
My life's work, for a
cool million Benjamins.

744
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:03,770
You got any idea
what that gets you?

745
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:06,809
We'll have more money than
we know what to do with.

746
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:09,839
Live like Kings for the rest
of our lucky fucking lives.

747
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,889
But it's all riding on the
sweet little snatch in there.

748
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,669
She's gotta be
absolutely perfect.

749
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,403
No damaged goods.

750
01:08:16,404 --> 01:08:17,443
Not even a scratch.

751
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:21,219
Now you got it?

752
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,319
- I got it.

753
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,320
- What's the code?

754
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:25,543
- I got it.

755
01:08:25,544 --> 01:08:26,663
- What's the code?

756
01:08:26,664 --> 01:08:27,949
Someone order a dress.

757
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:29,550
- Alright it's here.
- The tailor is not.

758
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,659
- What the fuck do you want?

759
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,869
- Excuse me?

760
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:49,609
Hi, I'm the stylist
hair, face and nails.

761
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:50,610
You Michael?

762
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,329
This is the address.

763
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,530
It's just shops, where
is he supposed to be.

764
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,483
- He said inside.

765
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,063
Like a rat in a sewer.

766
01:09:16,582 --> 01:09:18,415
They live like a maze.

767
01:09:21,302 --> 01:09:22,302
- What now?

768
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:41,501
- I found a way in.

769
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:22,533
- Good faith to our
remaining venture.

770
01:10:24,455 --> 01:10:26,247
- This is the most
generous gift Tashir son.

771
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,823
I'm deeply humbled.

772
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:32,770
- Bullshit.

773
01:11:23,932 --> 01:11:25,572
- Lose the dress.

774
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:26,406
- No.

775
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:27,503
- Lose the goddamn dress.

776
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,353
- Lose the fucking dress.

777
01:11:38,354 --> 01:11:39,354
- No.

778
01:12:50,946 --> 01:12:52,799
Magnificent.

779
01:12:55,248 --> 01:12:56,581
- Take her back.

780
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:04,870
- We got a deal.

781
01:13:04,871 --> 01:13:05,871
- Alright.

782
01:13:16,384 --> 01:13:17,413
- It's Chubby.

783
01:13:17,414 --> 01:13:18,673
Shit.

784
01:13:23,645 --> 01:13:24,478
- Let him go.

785
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,339
Your problem is with me.

786
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,529
- My problem is with Banducci.

787
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,291
- Then why come here?

788
01:13:30,292 --> 01:13:32,135
Go to Banducci.

789
01:13:32,136 --> 01:13:33,456
- You're going to
take me to him.

790
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,593
- No, I do not betray clients.

791
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,519
- They come to me always,

792
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,870
'cause everyone knows that.

793
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,750
- Point it at me,
I'm the boss here.

794
01:13:49,503 --> 01:13:52,443
, I ask for mercy.

795
01:14:06,012 --> 01:14:07,095
I am humbled.

796
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:10,325
I will not forget this.

797
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,653
- Banducci has my niece.

798
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,743
Your assignment on me is unjust.

799
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,679
- I no longer work for Banducci,

800
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,980
I will return his payment.

801
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,230
- Even though he
killed your nephew?

802
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,180
Chubby told me.

803
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:39,899
- Don't confuse today with
what will happen tomorrow.

804
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,743
Emotion and business do not mix.

805
01:14:43,021 --> 01:14:45,079
A time will come,
of my own choosing,

806
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,479
and my Diego will be avenged.

807
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,600
- Tell me where Banducci is?

808
01:14:49,947 --> 01:14:51,999
- On the graves of all my
ancestor's I do not know.

809
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,189
They come to me, always.

810
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,540
'Cause everyone knows that.

811
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,489
I guarantee you safe
passage from here.

812
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,839
Should we meet again,

813
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,490
there'll be no
legacy between us.

814
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,863
Okay, okay, okay.

815
01:15:22,555 --> 01:15:23,555
You alright?

816
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:25,458
Yeah.

817
01:15:26,795 --> 01:15:27,795
Alright.

818
01:15:47,973 --> 01:15:50,890
- I wouldn't let
her do that to me.

819
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,429
- I need your help, I
know where Banducci is.

820
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,970
Come on let's go play
cards, the boys are waiting.

821
01:16:19,971 --> 01:16:21,899
- Why are the boys even here?

822
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:22,733
Why?

823
01:16:22,734 --> 01:16:24,569
- Michael wants some back up.

824
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:25,403
- Yeah I can do the back up.

825
01:16:25,404 --> 01:16:26,589
I can do the forward,
I can do all that shit.

826
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:28,083
- Shut the fuck up.

827
01:16:49,474 --> 01:16:51,412
The money will be
here at 6:00 a.m.,

828
01:16:51,413 --> 01:16:52,889
I'll be here at 6:30 and
we'll close the deal.

829
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,390
- Fantastic, see you tomorrow.

830
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:01,970
Figure out which island
you wanna live on yet?

831
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,383
- Yeah, Long.

832
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:07,770
- Excuse me?

833
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,139
- Long Island.

834
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,840
- That's your
choice, Long Island?

835
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:14,473
- It's where my family is.

836
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:21,582
Call San Testaban,

837
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:24,020
I wanna hear that Jack
is dead and gone okay.

838
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,499
- Shit, must have dropped it

839
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,809
while wrestling with the bitch.

840
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,810
- Well go get it.

841
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,120
- Getting it.

842
01:17:35,345 --> 01:17:36,678
- Simple people.

843
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,454
- This is what I do best.

844
01:18:39,455 --> 01:18:40,455
Alone.

845
01:18:41,428 --> 01:18:43,016
- You can't fight Banducci

846
01:18:43,017 --> 01:18:44,943
and get Jaime out
at the same time.

847
01:18:49,576 --> 01:18:50,976
I'm looking forward
to meeting her.

848
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:54,947
Getting to know her.

849
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:03,800
How are we gonna get in?

850
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:08,330
- Got a crowbar?

851
01:19:11,697 --> 01:19:12,947
- In the trunk.

852
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:15,171
- That will do.

853
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:12,598
- Titanium.

854
01:27:14,879 --> 01:27:15,879
- Shoot.

855
01:27:17,556 --> 01:27:18,556
Shoot.

856
01:29:12,154 --> 01:29:15,499
- I'm Ash, I'm with
your Uncle Jack.

857
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,500
- He's here.

858
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:18,687
- Yeah, let's go.

859
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,409
- Hey Jack.

860
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:19,810
Somebody wants to say hello.

861
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:23,336
What do you have to
say for yourself?

862
01:30:23,337 --> 01:30:24,713
Huh?

863
01:30:24,714 --> 01:30:25,714
- Harry?

864
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:30,180
- Jack.

865
01:30:32,804 --> 01:30:35,460
I'm so sorry for everything.

866
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:37,630
Everything in the world.

867
01:30:39,357 --> 01:30:40,989
- All if forgiven Harry.

868
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:42,799
- That's sweet, you
hear that Harry.

869
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,053
Somebody's forgiven you.

870
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:47,190
- Alicia is she good?

871
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:49,940
- The best.

872
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:54,599
- Tell her I love her.

873
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,443
You can tell her yourself Harry.

874
01:30:59,367 --> 01:31:00,439
- It's what I want the most.

875
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,119
- Alright enough of this shit.

876
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,309
I brought him out her
for one reason Jack.

877
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:06,239
To watch you die.

878
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,790
Then he'll know there's no
home for his little girl

879
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,270
before I put a bullet
through his face.

880
01:32:48,713 --> 01:32:49,713
- Go.

881
01:32:56,955 --> 01:32:58,205
Watch the back.

882
01:33:02,115 --> 01:33:03,115
- Come on.

883
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,773
- Diego says hello.

884
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:34,390
He's waiting for you.

885
01:33:49,095 --> 01:33:50,762
- You and what army?

886
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,023
- San Testaban.

887
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:56,570
- That's not like you Jack.

888
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:00,823
- Life is full of
surprises Michael.

889
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:04,209
- No shit.

890
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:06,269
- I'll kill him and
then I'll kill you.

891
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:08,370
Too bad you brought
knives to a gun fight.

892
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,599
Poor choice Jack.

893
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,139
- He's bluffing Jack.

894
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,579
He won't kill me 'til
he's got his money.

895
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:17,219
I'm worth millions to him
alive and nothing dead.

896
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,119
Don't kid yourself.

897
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,997
- How many times can a man die?

898
01:34:22,552 --> 01:34:23,552
Farewell.

899
01:34:37,041 --> 01:34:38,124
- You failed.

900
01:34:40,937 --> 01:34:42,454
You die.

901
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:07,100
- You okay?

902
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,100
Unhurt?

903
01:35:08,904 --> 01:35:10,654
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

904
01:35:14,283 --> 01:35:15,283
- No.

905
01:35:19,256 --> 01:35:21,923
I am so sorry, it's your father.

906
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,460
- You're my father.

907
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,339
- Where's Ash?

908
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:38,549
- She needs help.

909
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:39,650
- You have to get out.

910
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,747
We're taking care of this place.

911
01:35:54,086 --> 01:35:56,753
Set the explosives, in the back.

912
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,060
- Ash!

913
01:36:07,455 --> 01:36:08,455
I got it.

914
01:36:13,283 --> 01:36:14,369
Ash.

915
01:36:14,370 --> 01:36:15,370
Ash.

916
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:18,010
Stay with me.

917
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:20,890
Ash.

918
01:36:25,901 --> 01:36:27,151
- Who is she?

919
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,543
- Someone very special.

920
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,590
I'll tell you about her.
