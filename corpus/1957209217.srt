2
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,318
[Steve] Mr. President.

3
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,487
[reels whirring]

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,989
We have to act now.

5
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,992
They marched on Poland,

6
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,359
and we did nothing.

7
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,663
And they kept marching.

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,300
They've taken control
of most of Europe. And Russia.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,769
- It's...
- [Roosevelt] An invasion.

10
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,670
[Steve] That's not all,
Mr. President.

11
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,906
He's been searching
for ancient artifacts

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,408
since 1933.

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,845
[Roosevelt]
You mean magical artifacts.

14
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,781
Merciful heaven.

15
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,348
What a maniac.

16
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,319
Unless, of course...
he's right.

17
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,060
I take it that's where
your big idea comes in?

18
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,828
[Steve] Let me introduce you
to the team.

19
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:03,363
Rex Tyler, known as Hourman.

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,333
He's one of the best scientists
America has to offer.

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,770
Now, he's developed
a chemical called Miraclo

22
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,773
to enhance speed,
strength, everything.

23
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,273
An hour at a time.

24
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,543
Then there's Dinah Lance.

25
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,412
- A bit of a fire brand with sonic sound abilities...
- [shrieking]

26
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,614
...that have gotten her shunned
by her community.

27
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:25,820
Next, since attaining
his powers of speed,

28
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,455
Jay Garrick has been
a full-time crime fighter.

29
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,091
And he's willing
to serve his country.

30
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,526
Finally, Carter Hall,

31
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,395
an ancient Egyptian
in a modern Egyptian's body.

32
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,964
Oh, and he's got wings.

33
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:40,101
[Roosevelt] Ancient Egyptian?
You can't be serious.

34
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,635
[Steve] Claims this is his

35
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,905
[clears throat]
fourth reincarnation.

36
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,007
- [Roosevelt] He's one of ours?
- [Steve] Yes, Sir.

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,575
[Roosevelt] I see. Lights.

38
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,476
[clicks button]

39
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:54,648
And you think they're enough

40
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,752
to fight back the Nazis
and magical artifacts?

41
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,120
I know they are.

42
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:03,423
But, who will lead
this motley crew?

43
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,325
I think
I've got someone in mind.

44
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,600
What do you say, Mr. President?

45
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,569
Are you ready to end this war?

46
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,440
[dramatic music playing]

47
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:42,622
[birds chirping]

48
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,693
[Barry] I can't remember
if I locked the car.

49
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,129
Or the apartment.

50
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,764
Or turned off the coffee pot.

51
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,066
[Iris laughing]

52
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,136
Honestly Barry, I don't know
how you've survived this long.

53
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,842
Hey, this is
our first trip to Metropolis,

54
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,911
I want it to be perfect.

55
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,980
According to the trajectory
of the sun,

56
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,614
we should have
the max amount of light

57
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,517
if we set the blanket... here.

58
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,061
Think we'll see Superman?

59
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,630
I thought you were
taking a day off.

60
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,033
Right, right, you're right.

61
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,237
[scoffs] I should have
brought sunscreen.

62
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,507
- Can I get your back?
- [sternly] Barry...

63
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,543
Cold cuts, bread, mayo.
Oh, I forgot the cheese.

64
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,511
No, Barry.

65
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,181
Do you think it might rain?

66
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:41,648
- I can grab an umbrella, just in case.
- Barry, just...

67
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,651
focus.

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,654
Everything okay?

69
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,124
What are we doing?

70
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,726
We're having a picnic.

71
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,861
You wanted to get out of town,
away from...

72
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,030
[whispers] my other job.

73
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,798
But, we're never fully away

74
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:58,966
from your other job.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,967
[somber music playing]

76
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,703
That's not fair.

77
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:08,075
It's who you are,
and I love that about you.

78
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:11,678
But, Barry, it's been... years.

79
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,118
What do you want from me?

80
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,786
Is this just a fling?
Because I...

81
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,287
No, no, Iris...

82
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,923
It's okay if it is,
but I'm not interested in...

83
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,059
I love you.

84
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,765
It's just...

85
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,100
the best way to keep you safe is
by making sure no one finds out.

86
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:41,608
If you really believe that,
then break up with me, Barry Allen.

87
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,944
Iris...

88
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,679
Life is dangerous.

89
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,615
It shouldn't stop us
from living it.

90
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,685
[distant explosion]

91
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,295
Go. You have work to do.

92
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,033
I... I'll make it up to you.

93
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,902
Tomorrow. I promise.

94
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,811
- [glass breaking]
- [all screaming]

95
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:18,979
[sinister music playing]

96
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:28,621
Resistance... is... illogical.

97
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,360
[grunting]

98
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,680
I have you now, Superman.

99
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:56,951
[grunts]

100
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,023
Superman! What can I do?

101
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,426
[straining] Maybe help
with the tentacles?

102
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,393
Right. Sure.

103
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,868
[grunts and groans]

104
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,283
Are you all right?

105
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,919
I will be
after we take care of Brainiac.

106
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,421
What do you say?
Interested in a team-up?

107
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,856
I thought you'd never ask.

108
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,695
Another meta.

109
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,201
- Chance of success down to 95%. Recalibrating.
- [beeps]

110
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,069
[machine whirring]

111
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,178
[grunts]

112
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,715
Accelerating projectile.

113
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:02,416
[buzzing]

114
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,328
[groans]

115
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,201
Superman!

116
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:24,038
Recalibration. Success at 99%.

117
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,309
[whirring and beeping]

118
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,117
Are you okay?

119
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,420
That gem... it's Kryptonite.

120
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,988
It's the only thing
that can hurt me.

121
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,994
But, you're like a God.

122
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,996
So, what's the plan?

123
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,497
Don't get hit. Avoid the beam.

124
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,899
Punch really hard.

125
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:52,900
Save the day.

126
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,268
I like it.

127
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,346
[Flash grunts]

128
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:09,516
[ominous music playing]

129
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:13,520
[Dr. Fate's voice echoing]
<i>Keep running!</i>

130
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:16,190
<i>Follow my voice.</i>

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,868
[ominous music playing]

132
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,520
[soldiers grunting]

133
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,990
[growls]

134
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,225
[groans]

135
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,166
[sinister music playing]

136
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,168
[glass breaks]

137
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,505
[gun cocking]

138
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:46,447
[soldiers grunting]

139
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,167
[screaming]

140
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:21,115
Any sign of him?

141
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,282
Not yet.

142
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:24,051
We should have gone with him.

143
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,486
We had our own mission.

144
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,954
We're running out of time.

145
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,389
Rex's hour is almost up.

146
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,457
If we don't leave soon,
civilians will die.

147
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,960
We wait.

148
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,229
Steve won't let us down.

149
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,631
Go check on the left flank
and report back.

150
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,379
[Flash grunts]

151
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:57,719
[straining] What kind
of crazy gun was that?

152
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,987
It will take more
than the speed of Hermes

153
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,456
to stop an Amazon, fiend.

154
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,624
Who are you?

155
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,329
So, they've got
one of their own.

156
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,732
- [planes whirring]
- Wait, what?

157
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:11,632
[guns firing]

158
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:21,675
Wonder Woman, what's the plan?

159
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,243
Regroup with the others.

160
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,045
Tell Carter
to take care of the planes.

161
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,648
We need to buy more time.

162
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,150
Did President Roosevelt
send you?

163
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,518
President Roosevelt?

164
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:33,620
What? What's happening?

165
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,557
Keep an eye on...

166
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,525
whatever this is.

167
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,661
I got him, boss.

168
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,067
Am I dead?

169
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,203
Sometimes feels like it
in France.

170
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,572
France?

171
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,406
- [man shouting in German]
- [woman pleading in French]

172
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,242
Someone's in trouble.

173
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,543
Everyone's in trouble
right now.

174
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:59,580
You're not going any... where.

175
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:03,150
[woman shouting in French]

176
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,319

[guns cocking]

179
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,298
Nazis?

180
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,205
[clangs]

181
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,173

[Nazi soldiers grunting]

[breathing heavily]

184
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:53,267
What... what is... [groaning]

185
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,235
I've never been
out of breath before.

186
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,470
[straining] Not again!

187
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,506
Who've you got there,
Wonder Woman?

188
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:01,375
Is he one of theirs?

189
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,113
It's unlikely he'd be working
for the Germans.

190
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,648
[straining] Right.

191
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,150
So, I think
I know what's going on here.

192
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,553
I can't... breathe.

193
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,091
[gasping and breathing heavily]

194
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,427
I'm... I'm from the future.

195
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,831
Jay, report.

196
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:27,134
Uh, it's not impossible.

197
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,602
I mean, with the Speed Force.

198
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,538
Sounds more like something
a Nazi would say.

199
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:34,675
There are things that
we don't understand, forces...

200
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,611
I don't want to hear
about reincarnation, Carter.

201
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,112
Make him talk.

202
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,816
What about your lasso?

203
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:45,118
I'll get him to talk.
[cracks knuckles]

204
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,888
[sternly] We don't have time
to discuss this.

205
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,589
[explosion]

206
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:54,428
We've got a fight to finish and I
have less than ten minutes left.

207
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,395
[planes whirring]

208
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,436
Take cover!

209
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,337
[glass breaking]

210
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:18,185
Wait!

211
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,188
[Hourman] It's Steve!

212
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,122
[triumphant music playing]

213
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:35,602
Hawkman!

214
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,238
[ominous music playing]

215
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,775
Based on the trajectory,

216
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:42,744
the velocity,
Hawkman's wingspan...

217
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:43,644
he won't make it.

218
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,349
[Steve] Come on! Come on!

219
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:52,185
[engine explodes]

220
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,186
[engine sputtering]

221
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,868
Let's try for
one piece, Trevor.

222
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,442
[Flash panting]

223
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:20,514
[grunts] Whoa! What's going on
with my speed?

224
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:25,352
[breathing heavy] You got this.
Come on.

225
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:28,890
What now, Red?

226
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,327
A Flash classic.

227
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,630
[electricity crackling]

228
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,343
[Jay groans]

229
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,518
[sizzling]

230
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,928
It's good
to see you, too, Princess.

231
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,265
[Flash panting]

232
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,636
I see you picked up
another playmate?

233
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,874
It seems I misjudged you.

234
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:21,743
Thank you.

235
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:22,642
[panting] Heh.

236
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,383
- Retreat back to our extraction.
- Wait.

237
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,453
They're gonna
tear this village apart.

238
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,455
Look, I saw another division
headed this way.

239
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:36,623
They're looking for me.

240
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:40,895
We can't leave them.

241
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,798
Spread out.

242
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,665
Hourman, you and Jay
with me on the ground.

243
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,002
Carter, you and Dinah
take the sky.

244
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,337
- And I can do...
- Nothing.

245
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,405
Look, if you really are
from the future,

246
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,474
we can't complicate
the timeline.

247
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,010
Oh, right.
I've seen that movie.

248
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,314
Get Steve to the extraction
point in one piece.

249
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:02,516
He'll lead the way.

250
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,855
[Flash] This is crazy.

251
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,690
I've never seen this many
heroes working together.

252
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:13,928
[Steve laughs] Kid,
you ain't seen nothin' yet.

253
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,001
How come I've never heard about them?
About this?

254
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,836
The JSA?

255
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,537
Justice Society of America.

256
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,706
Yeah I know. Corny.

257
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,774
We're top secret.

258
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,375
Real high-level stuff.

259
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,477
Even have a war correspondent
embedded with us

260
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,979
to spin the stories.

261
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:34,648
Keep the super-powered team
off the front page.

262
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,117
Why try and keep it a secret?

263
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,819
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen

264
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,788
and I can run faster
than sound. Usually.

265
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:43,657
Coolest? That's nifty.

266
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,126
Look, they're not infallible.

267
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,527
And if Hitler found
any sort of weakness,

268
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,663
it will be the end of the world
as we know it.

269
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,781
[Black Canary shrieks]

270
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,790

271
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:31,706

[straining]

273

[grunts]

275
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:34,035
We've used the giant bird
excuse twice in the last month.

276
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:36,070
I don't think we'll
get away with it a third time.

277
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:37,972
Let's not push our luck.

278
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:41,809
Just refer to Carter's attack
as an experimental prototype.

279
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:43,778
Be sure to give the soldiers
all the credit.

280
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,579
They protected the citizens.

281
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:51,218
Without them, we wouldn't have
been able to focus.

282
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:53,988
Makes my job easy.

283
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,756
And what do I write
about this guy?

284
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:00,660
Nothing, as usual.

285
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,530
We don't even know your name.

286
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:08,501
Oh. Uh... I'm Flash.

287
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:10,603
Well, we've already got
one of those.

288
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,742
How about Future Boy?

289
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:19,013
That will work for now.

290
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:21,749
Future Boy,
this is Shakespeare,

291
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:22,950
our war correspondent.

292
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:30,157
Do I know you?

293
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,932
[Steve] Princess,
I've waited long enough.

294
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:40,935
Is this happening?

295
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,972
This is happening.

296
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,606
[Steve] I can't
hold this in anymore.

297
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:49,810
Will you marry me?

298
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:56,649
Good attempt, Trevor.

299
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:04,091
He upped his game.
[chuckles] Flowers.

300
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,526
If he doesn't quit soon,
I'll lose my bet.

301
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,666
Wait... what was that about?

302
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,038
He proposes every day,
and every day she says "no."

303
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,041
Didn't take you for a stalker.

304
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:22,943
Stalker? Is...
You mean like a cad? A wolf?

305
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:24,879
No, no. It's...
it's nothing like that. I...

306
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:28,681
If it really bothered her, I...

307
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:32,353
She promised one day
she'd say yes.

308
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,621
When... when it was
the right time, of course.

309
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,223
And that...

310
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:38,259
Well, that makes
every other day just worth it.

311
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:40,928
Thank you, soldier.

312
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:47,101
Extraction's here.

313
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:50,838
Of course, you know, if she ever does
say yes, I might drop dead from shock.

314
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:52,273
[birds chirping]

315

<i>We said we would end this war.</i>

316
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:01,082
It's been two years.

317
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:03,384
That's not our call, Diana.

318
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,119
Too many people
have died already.

319
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,987
- We can stop this.
- [loud crash]

320
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:11,225
Oh my goodness.
Please, take a seat.

321
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:16,063
You want to stop this?
Future Boy could stop It.

322
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:18,332
That's not a good idea, Dinah.

323
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,868
We can't use the future
to change the past.

324
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,803
It would create a paradox

325
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:25,840
and this Flash won't be able to
return to his own time period.

326
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,741
Or this could be
how it happens.

327
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,810
That much I knew.
See, there's this movie...

328
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:32,213
Paradox. Unable to go home.

329
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,382
Right. Shutting up.

330
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,917
[Wonder Woman] Dinah's right.

331
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:40,154
We need to utilize
every meta-human we can.

332
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,423
We can't keep putting civilians
in danger.

333
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:44,325
Well, I suppose
those of us without power

334
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:45,860
are just chopped liver?

335
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:49,196
So, we're just supposed
to let people die?

336
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,931
Oh, we can handle ourselves,
your Highness.

337
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:51,932
Don't worry about us.

338
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:54,802
Oh, I get that the rest

339
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:55,936
of the gang have powers...

340
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:59,306
War is a place for warriors.

341
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,640
Not a place for wishes.

342
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,912
Well, everybody's gotta die
some time, Princess.

343
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,348
I won't.

344
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:11,385
Look, it's gonna take everyone
to get off the sidelines

345
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:13,686
and onto the field
to win this war.

346
00:24:13,721 --> 00:24:15,389
And if I die,

347
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:17,690
at least it'll be
for something I believe in.

348
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,431
Are they always like this?

349
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:26,400
Like a broken record, son.

350
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,902
[Steve] You've got
a new mission.

351
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:31,705
We can't decode the intel.

352
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,075
So, that fight was what? A gas?

353
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:38,312
What exactly was
this intel supposed to be for?

354
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:40,781
The Germans are looking for
a new artifact.

355
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,283
They're saying
it's a game changer.

356
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,920
If we can't read the code,
then what's the mission?

357
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:47,855
Now, I have a lead
on some help.

358
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,857
A man with mystical abilities.

359
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,792
They pulled him
out of their camps

360
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,827
and stuck him in a securely
guarded castle in Bavaria.

361
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:56,397
They say he can break any code.

362
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,233
Problem is... he's insane.

363
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,802
Insane?

364
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,939
And what are we
going to do about him?

365
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:06,440
What do our scientists think?

366
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:09,076
The best course of action...

367
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:11,278
After narrowing in
on the potential outcomes...

368
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:13,347
Not to mention
the quantum physics,

369
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,283
which is really something
that should be studied here...

370
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:17,985
To the point, gentlemen.

371
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,855
He should stick with us.
For research.

372
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:24,458
Then, Future Boy...

373
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:25,926
welcome to the team.

374
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,429
[crickets chirping]

375
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:35,769
[vehicle approaching]

376
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,517
[suspenseful music playing]

377
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,143
We should slip in
without notice.

378
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,979
You've seen your wings, right?

379
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:20,948
This place is a fortress.

380
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:23,517
We won't be able
to take it by stealth.

381
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,452
Stick to the plan.
You all know what to do.

382
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:27,421
Jay and Rex worked these out.

383
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:29,523
They're for communication.

384
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:32,126
When you have a message,
tap the earpiece in Morse code

385
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,828
and the message will be
received in our own ear pieces.

386
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,563
Oh, do I get one?

387
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:39,033
No. You're with me, Future Boy.

388
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:41,135
Let's move out.

389
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,571
[yelps]

390
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:45,973
[soldiers grunting]

391
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:52,913
[gun cocking]

392
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:58,252
[clangs]

393
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,556
Shouldn't we have attempted
to be more...

394
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:03,957
I don't know, stealth?

395
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,860
Carter worries too much.

396
00:27:08,228 --> 00:27:10,831
You're very... upfront.

397
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:15,235
Like Steve said,
we all die sooner or later.

398
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:21,375
[sighs] What? It is a joke.

399
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,446
No it isn't. Not to Steve.

400
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,048
He thinks it's as simple

401
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,483
as asking a question.

402
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:30,651
He doesn't realize

403
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,353
what he asks.

404
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:33,822
[man screaming in distance]

405
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:36,223
That sounded...

406
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:37,157
Bad.

407
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:38,359
[earpiece beeping]

408
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,194
It's Steve.

409
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:41,595
He needs us to see something.

410
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:45,099
Now.

411
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:48,202
Can't you just zip in, take out
their guns and zip out?

412
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:50,471
- I could, but...
- But what?

413
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,107
Well...

414
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:56,944
my powers
haven't been acting right

415
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,379
since the other Flash arrived.

416
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:01,448
Of course.
Why is it always us?

417
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,917
[Jay] Don't belly ache.
It's not always us.

418
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,320
It's just mostly us.

419
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:10,324
I should take a swig
of the Miraclo.

420
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,358
You can't.

421
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,460
It's not been 24 hours yet.

422
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,629
I'm no use to you like this.

423
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:16,997
We're running out of options.

424
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,500
[gun cocking]

425
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:22,236
If this goes haywire,
blame the new guy.

426
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:25,572
[groans]

427
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:26,473
[gun firing]

428
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:29,943
[grunts]

429
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,046
[gun cocking]

430
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,115
[grunts]

431
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:45,058
Who says an old dog
can't learn new tricks.

432
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:50,330
[Black Canary sighs]
This is not what I had in mind

433
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:53,033
when I joined
an elite fighting force.

434
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,569
But you've got so much
experience digging through dirt.

435
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:02,710
You all right?

436
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,681
Regular good-time Charley.

437
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,554
You've been hard
on Future Boy.

438
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:16,390
It's just he...

439
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,592
he doesn't know
anything about us.

440
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,131
We're supposed to be
a secret.

441
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,068
No, I know, but...

442
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,103
But what?

443
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:34,007
[sighs]
What's the point of all this

444
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,043
if we aren't even remembered?

445
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:38,479
We fight, we die.

446
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,448
Death probably isn't scary

447
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:43,350
when you have someone
waiting for you.

448
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:47,521
And what about the nice
detective back home?

449
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:50,657
Larry?

450
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:54,495
I don't really think
he's the one. You know?

451
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:00,802
Listen, I know
things seem dire,

452
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:02,804
but one day
this will all be over

453
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:04,739
and we will all need
to live again.

454
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,542
For me it's finding
that other half

455
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:09,777
that I look forward to.

456
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,513
[man screaming]

457
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,549
[tense music playing]

458
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,327
That's, uh...

459
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,329
That's not what
I think it's for, is it?

460
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:31,331
[chains clanking]

461
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,503
Shakespeare is looking.

462
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:38,472
Diana...

463
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,607
I didn't know.

464
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,278
Let's go help.

465
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,524
Two corridors left.
I'm checking now.

466
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:02,696
[door creaking]

467
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:12,306
[flies buzzing]

468
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:14,308
[door creaking]

469
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:18,178
[flies continue buzzing]

470
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:21,148
[coughs]

471
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:28,188
[door creaks]

472
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,603
It's... you.

473
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:44,137
He said you would come.

474
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:46,239
And here you are.

475
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,843
This is yours.

476
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:51,511
I'm supposed
to give this to you.

477
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:53,380
What are you
talking about, kid?

478
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,215
Take it. Use it.

479
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:58,886
You have to make sure
it never happens.

480
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:05,258
I'm sure that's why
I'm back here now.

481
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,526
He said you'd know
what to do.

482
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,529
Who said?

483
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:10,430
[soldier] Halt!

484
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,133
[gun fires]

485
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:34,588
[grunts]

486
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:35,723
[creaking]

487
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:38,291
[Jay] How's it going?

488
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:42,930
[thudding]

489
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,933
[water dripping]

490
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:48,870
[Dr. Fate] Should we tell?

491
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:54,408
Yes. Yes, they should know.
They should know.

492
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,243
[speaking Latin]

493
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,350
No. It...

494
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:05,853
it can't be.

495
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:07,387
[continues speaking Latin]

496
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:09,589
Do you know this guy?

497
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,664
[groans]

498
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:19,366
I know him
from a previous life.

499
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,836
Is this...

500
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,705
He's the code breaker?

501
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:25,807
He wasn't like this before.

502
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,474
Well, make him snap out of it.

503
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,744
- We're not equipped to handle...
- [Dr. Fate] Dead.

504
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:33,280
They're all going to be dead.
[shuddering]

505
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,717
They need to know.
They should know.

506
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:38,552
Jay, do you have the code?

507
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,660
We need your help, my friend.

508
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:47,995
Can you translate this?

509
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,306
[gasping]

510
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:03,911
[groaning]

511
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,880
Well, that was anti-climactic.

512
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:12,419
[groans]

513
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:34,508
[Steve] Shakespeare,
the bullet hit you dead on.

514
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:39,446
Steve, release these captives.

515
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,887
You keep calling me
Shakespeare, but it's...

516
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:48,756
[exhales]
It's Clark.

517
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:50,690
It's Clark Kent.

518
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:54,796
Well, you... you're Superman.

519
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,429
It's me, Flash.

520
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:57,765
How did you get here?

521
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,366
Did you follow me
through that time warp?

522
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,468
Is this a rescue?
Why do you have a mustache?

523
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:04,604
Stuck? What are you
talking about?

524
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:07,607
You... [sputters]
You're Superman.

525
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:10,510
You fight for truth, justice.
You save people.

526
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:14,916
I don't even know how
to wrap my head around this.

527
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,852
You are invincible?

528
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,754
I'm a little tough-skinned,
that's all.

529
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,795
If you stand by
and do nothing...

530
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:31,364
you are as bad as the Nazis.

531
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:32,599
[chain clanking]

532
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:33,567
You're wrong.

533
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:38,072
Then why are you here?

534
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:41,508
- To get this story.
- But you...

535
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,510
You're one of the most
selfless people I know.

536
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:45,813
I don't know you.

537
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,149
In my time on this planet,

538
00:35:48,182 --> 00:35:49,951
I learned you look out
for yourself.

539
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:53,587
This planet?

540
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:56,456
But in my time...

541
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,059
Something's different.

542
00:35:58,092 --> 00:35:59,392
What about your parents?

543
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:04,564
Martha and Jonathan Kent
died in an accident

544
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,466
when I was three-years-old.

545
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,135
I was sent to an orphanage.

546
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,508
I'm going to make sure the
captives get out of the building.

547
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:18,145
Does that make me complicit?

548
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:25,052
Wait, this...

549
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:26,153
I'm not...

550
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:27,088
This isn't...

551
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:28,155
Are you all right?

552
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:30,758
I'm not in the past.

553
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,093
This isn't a different time.

554
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,528
What are you talking about?

555
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:37,932
This is...

556
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,033
this is a different Earth.

557
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:41,501
I have to find Jay.

558
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,548
Was he always able to do this?

559
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:57,919
This... and so much more.

560
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,729
- These are...
- Coordinates.

561
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:10,831
For where?

562
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:13,901
- It looks like...
- The Bermuda Triangle.

563
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:21,008
No, he's not ready yet.

564
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:23,044
Yes, he's received
the package,

565
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:24,946
but he doesn't know
what it means.

566
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:39,592
It's you.

567
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:43,264
I saw you when I traveled here.

568
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:45,866
Please, do you know a way
for me to get back home?

569
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,500
Back to my universe?

570
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:49,203
Your universe?

571
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:52,773
But this would be Earth 1,
the real Earth.

572
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:54,742
This is the multiverse theory.

573
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,844
You're not
making this up, right?

574
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:01,015
You may return,

575
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:04,151
but you have another task
ahead of you

576
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:08,155
and a lesson you must learn.

577
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:09,622
Only then can you...

578
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:11,892
No, I won't tell him
about the League.

579
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:17,164
You will see her again soon.

580
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:22,803
And...

581
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:25,505
You should go.

582
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:27,708
It's starting.

583
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,329
[Steve] Sounds like
this guy's gone cockeyed.

584
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:50,064
Maybe.

585
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:52,833
But Hitler worked hard
to keep this place a secret.

586
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:53,901
Where's Shakespeare?

587
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:57,537
[sighs] He's on his own.

588
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:00,041
What are the coordinates for?

589
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,310
The Bermuda Triangle.

590
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:06,947
But it's... it's a legend.

591
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:11,285
So are we. Got anything
for us, Future Boy?

592
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:13,154
We're not in my world.

593
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,022
This isn't my past.
I don't...

594
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:16,157
I don't know where to start.

595
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,861
Steve, can you get us a ship?

596
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:22,329
I'll do you one better,
Princess.

597
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,851
Just try it on.
See if it fits.

598
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:47,721
- You're relentless.
- That's why you love me.

599
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:49,723
[door creaks]

600
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:53,794
Two. Maybe three.

601
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:57,364
Down bubble, five degrees.

602
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:59,366
Slow propeller by 50%.

603
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,870
[hinges creaking]

604
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,405
Contact?

605
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:06,639
Two, maybe three ships
above us.

606
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:07,875
Do they know we're here?

607
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,277
We're about to find out.

608
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:12,279
[sonar pinging]

609
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:29,230
Ooh, is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

610
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:32,665
Splashes.

611
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,736
Down bubble, full speed.
Right rudder, 15 degrees.

612
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,071
Right rudder, 15 degrees.

613
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,715
[tense music playing]

614
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:55,055
[alarm blaring]

615
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:58,392
- Report!
- Leaks toward aft.

616
00:40:58,425 --> 00:40:59,727
Engine room is flooding.

617
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:03,731
Where your tools,
and how do you fix leaks?

618
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:16,343
[pants]

619
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:19,780
[hinges creaking]

620
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:22,950
Ooh! And Iris says
I'm not handy.

621
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:24,018
[continues panting]

622
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:36,463
What's happening?

623
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:37,898
The depth charges have
knocked out our engines.

624
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:39,400
We have to surface.

625
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,168
If we surface, we're dead.

626
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:43,437
Is there any way
to restart the engines?

627
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,940
You have an extra
20 batteries lying around?

628
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,275
No. But I have
the next best thing.

629
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:50,878
[explosion]

630
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:53,314
Give me a hand.

631
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,486
There she is. What now?

632
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,488
We build up enough electricity
to jump start her.

633
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:04,391
[electrical buzzing]

634
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:14,868
Well, I'll be...

635
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,306
What the hell are you doing?

636
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,341
Going out there.

637
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,912
Look this behind me
and flood the tube.

638
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:28,782
Steve?

639
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:35,356
You are just so beautiful

640
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,158
when you're about to kick
some Nazi tail.

641
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:40,394
You know, there is a captain
on board.

642
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:42,496
Let me make an honest
Amazon out of you.

643
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:46,533
See you when I get back.

644
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:51,272
- [alarm beeping]
- Someone's flooded Tube 1.

645
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:53,073
Did you order
a torpedo launch?

646
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,808
- No
- [thudding]

647
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:57,211
Then what is it?

648
00:42:58,012 --> 00:42:58,979
One guess.

649
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:26,140
Sir, depth charges...
They're...

650
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:27,474
going up.

651
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:43,924
[sonar pinging]

652
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:56,370
[explosion]

653
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,029
You okay?

654
00:44:56,063 --> 00:45:00,501
Yes, we had... help.

655
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:02,035
What kind of help?

656
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:04,571
Some sort of... aqua men.

657
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,482
Greetings, surface dwellers.

658
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:51,151
On behalf of our king,
we welcome you.

659
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,588
What is this place?

660
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:57,057
An outpost.

661
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,225
A place where the people

662
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:00,227
of Atlantis can stay informed

663
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,129
about the irrational behavior

664
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:03,564
of the monkeys above us.

665
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:06,667
Rude.

666
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,536
Come. Our king
would like a word.

667
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:28,455
[beeping]

668
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:32,359
My King, here are the ones
that repelled the boats.

669
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:38,398
Welcome.

670
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,169
I am Arthur,

671
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:45,105
ruler of Atlantis and all of
the oceans of this world.

672
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,640
What brings you to my kingdom?

673
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:50,344
Your Highness, I am Diana,

674
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:52,312
Princess of Themyscira.

675
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:54,615
I know of your island.

676
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:58,385
I'm sorry for your loss.

677
00:46:58,418 --> 00:47:01,388
Thank you, but what happened
there could happen

678
00:47:01,421 --> 00:47:04,291
to the rest of the surface
world without your help.

679
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:07,628
The boundaries of my kingdom

680
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:08,629
far exceeds those

681
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:09,663
on the surface and demand

682
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:11,164
my undivided attention.

683
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:13,534
Tell me,

684
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:14,668
why should I care about

685
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,738
the affairs of those above?

686
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:18,706
Because these Nazis
will not stop

687
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,041
until the whole world
is theirs.

688
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:24,746
Above and below.

689
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:28,816
Yes, the blood of air breathers
does run hot.

690
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,785
I think you speak true,
daughter of a Hippolyta.

691
00:47:31,652 --> 00:47:33,687
I will help you.

692
00:47:33,721 --> 00:47:36,390
Sire...
[whispering indistinctly]

693
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,693
Come. There is something I have

694
00:47:39,727 --> 00:47:41,461
that might turn the tide
in your favor.

695
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,534
Hm. The king of Atlantis
made a pun.

696
00:47:53,908 --> 00:47:55,642
Please, in here.

697
00:48:01,214 --> 00:48:02,516
I see nothing.

698
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:03,517
Quite.

699
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:06,620
[powering up]

700
00:48:06,653 --> 00:48:07,521
[grunts]

701
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:13,327
I'm afraid Atlantean magic
is quite powerful.

702
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,496
There's no use
in trying to escape.

703
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,767
Maybe he would have if you had
gotten here sooner.

704
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:22,235
But now...

705
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:23,136
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

706
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:32,145
Once upon a time,
a modern day pirate

707
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:35,649
smuggling, traversing the ocean
to make my fortune

708
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:39,252
and then,
a storm destroyed my ship

709
00:48:39,286 --> 00:48:41,723
and the Atlanteans saved me.

710
00:48:41,756 --> 00:48:42,924
Little did they know

711
00:48:42,957 --> 00:48:45,192
that my particular talents

712
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:46,560
would grant me control

713
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:47,694
of their king.

714
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:49,596
[Hourman]
So you're human like us?

715
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,565
Then why side with the Nazis?

716
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,567
Don't you know
what they're doing up there?

717
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,636
Of course, I do.

718
00:48:55,669 --> 00:48:58,672
It always pays
to be on the winning side.

719
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:03,778
And with the Allies superpower
team off the table... [chuckles]

720
00:49:03,811 --> 00:49:07,614
Honestly, I'm surprised
you took the bait.

721
00:49:08,649 --> 00:49:10,350
The codes.

722
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:11,819
You set us up.

723
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:15,589
Obviously. The war
is all but over.

724
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,491
And you have lost.

725
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:20,762
Enjoy the solitude
of this prison

726
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:22,797
because when we return...

727
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,898
[grunting]

728
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:32,639
No. Wait.
Why did I imprison those people?

729
00:49:32,673 --> 00:49:34,374
They seemed upright...

730
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:35,542
True.

731
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:38,980
Because they are
the enemy, Sire.

732
00:49:39,013 --> 00:49:42,884
They want to rule your kingdom,
pollute your water,

733
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:45,285
enslave your children.

734
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:49,256
Enslave? No.

735
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:52,794
We must help these Germans
win their war,

736
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:56,296
and then,
when both sides are weak,

737
00:49:57,364 --> 00:49:59,332
we'll destroy them all.

738
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:01,334
Yes?

739
00:50:02,636 --> 00:50:03,705
Yes.

740
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,675
It's time to show those above
what true power looks like.

741
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:14,514
[clanging]

742
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:21,823
- Give it a rest, will you?
- [panting]

743
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:25,392
We need a plan.

744
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:27,427
I think Red over there
is working on it.

745
00:50:31,598 --> 00:50:33,901
- You okay?
- What? Yeah, yeah.

746
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:36,369
I'm just...
Ever since I've arrived,

747
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:38,638
I've been less.

748
00:50:38,672 --> 00:50:39,807
Maybe I've lost some energy

749
00:50:39,841 --> 00:50:41,042
from overextending myself

750
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:42,409
by getting
to this world, but...

751
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,611
The Speed Force.

752
00:50:44,644 --> 00:50:46,279
What's the Speed Force?

753
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:49,316
Well, it's just
a working theory,

754
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,551
but it's a little like
photosynthesis.

755
00:50:51,585 --> 00:50:54,321
You know, the way plants
convert sunlight into energy?

756
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:56,023
Imagine the Speed Force
is the sun,

757
00:50:56,057 --> 00:50:57,691
and we draw energy from it,

758
00:50:57,725 --> 00:51:00,327
converting it into
our speed abilities.

759
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,064
I've been having
the same problem.

760
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:04,866
If both of us are drawing
from the Speed Force

761
00:51:04,899 --> 00:51:06,000
at the same time...

762
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:07,735
We'll be less powerful.

763
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:10,303
Although if we could somehow
combine our energy...

764
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:11,939
We might regain full power.

765
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:14,574
How will that bypass magic?

766
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:16,443
Physics are universal, Diana.

767
00:51:16,476 --> 00:51:19,412
When I was younger, I could
vibrate between molecules

768
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:21,716
phasing through solid objects.

769
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:22,984
Have you ever done that?

770
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:25,318
Seriously? You can do that?

771
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:27,855
What the heck have
I been doing all these years?

772
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:29,957
All right.
Hands on the floor.

773
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:32,626
Start vibrating.
You'll feel it when it's close.

774
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:33,593
I'll try to help.

775
00:51:51,078 --> 00:51:52,479
[grunting]

776
00:51:55,515 --> 00:51:57,084
Keep going!

777
00:51:58,552 --> 00:52:00,353
[grunts]

778
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:02,957
Oh, [chuckles]
I can't believe that worked.

779
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:09,797
Seize him!

780
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:11,398
[grunting]

781
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:13,901
Where did your king go?

782
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:16,436
I will tell you nothing,
mouth-breathing, finless...

783
00:52:18,538 --> 00:52:19,406
[groans]

784
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:20,908
I yield.

785
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:29,683
- You made it.
- Thanks to Jay.

786
00:52:30,517 --> 00:52:31,585
Stand back.

787
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:42,763
We have to get
to the surface.

788
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:45,398
Warn the Allies
of the Atlanteans involvement.

789
00:52:45,432 --> 00:52:46,968
No, there's no time.

790
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:48,970
It turns out the Atlanteans
and Nazis are launching

791
00:52:49,003 --> 00:52:52,139
a surprise attack against
the Eastern Seaboard of the US.

792
00:52:52,173 --> 00:52:53,573
Then we stop them.

793
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:56,110
Yes, but that's not all.

794
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:58,678
One of the guards
said that King Aqua... Man

795
00:52:58,713 --> 00:53:00,513
is headed down to the trench.

796
00:53:00,547 --> 00:53:01,849
Someplace nearby.

797
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:03,751
He's going to unlock
some sort of cage.

798
00:53:03,784 --> 00:53:06,120
So... what's in the cage?

799
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,488
I have no idea,

800
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:10,157
but it can't be good.

801
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:12,459
Right. You're coming with me

802
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:14,729
to stop him from opening...
whatever.

803
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:17,098
- And the rest of us?
- Take the submarine.

804
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:18,598
You have to beat them there.

805
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,069
Be careful.

806
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:23,470
I'm always careful.

807
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:26,107
We both know that's not true.

808
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,644
[tense music playing]

809
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:35,850
[sonar pinging]

810
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:41,488
I think I found them.
Dead ahead.

811
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:49,462
What does this do?

812
00:53:50,697 --> 00:53:52,800
Oh!

813
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,836
Atlantean pressure suit.
Cool.

814
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,573
- [punches landing]
- [men grunting]

815
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:04,779
[men grunting]

816
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:11,218
[chuckles]
We were getting worried.

817
00:54:11,953 --> 00:54:13,154
So were we.

818
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:14,755
Captain, I need you
and the boys

819
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,724
to get us to New York
as soon as possible.

820
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,192
It would be my pleasure.

821
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:20,094
You heard the man.
Let's move.

822
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:22,763
Take us out of this hell hole.
Full speed.

823
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:30,670
They've got quite a lead.

824
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:32,039
There's no way
we can beat him there.

825
00:54:32,073 --> 00:54:33,673
We have to try.

826
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:34,976
Jay, how are you feeling?

827
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,644
Ship shape.

828
00:54:37,677 --> 00:54:39,180
Are you up for supercharging
those batteries again?

829
00:54:39,213 --> 00:54:41,182
I have to be. This is war.

830
00:55:00,334 --> 00:55:02,737
Now, Your Highness,

831
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:06,073
use your trident
to focus your call.

832
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:08,575
Unlock the gate.

833
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:11,979
Bring the creatures.
Seal our victory.

834
00:55:25,592 --> 00:55:27,028
Yes!

835
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:29,830

[Advisor] My.

You're a strong one.

839
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:53,220
Don't worry.

840
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:55,256
You'll get
your fill of violence.

00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:14,607

Fall in love
with an Amazonian princess

866
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:17,151

01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:20,087
Steve Trevor, never complain
about being bored again.

It's best

I bet it tastes fine in butter.

get the big guy.

885

to the city.

01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:30,584

01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:09,683
You spend so much time

909
01:04:09,717 --> 01:04:10,584
building walls,

910
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:13,554
keeping people out,

911
01:04:13,587 --> 01:04:16,390
and I know
you've been hurt before, but...

912
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:17,658
you have to
promise me something.

913
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:21,061
Promise me you won't
give up on this.

914
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:23,230
On life.

915
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:26,166
On love.

916
01:04:28,836 --> 01:04:30,437
Remember. [grunts in pain]

917
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,405
It's the only thing

918
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:33,273
worth living for.

919
01:04:34,508 --> 01:04:35,576
[gasps]

920
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:37,210
Carter.

921
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:39,313
Please.

922
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:41,248
Please.

923
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:42,616
Chay-Ara.

924
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:44,685
I'm coming.

925
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:48,790
I'm...

926
01:04:48,823 --> 01:04:50,357
[Black Canary crying]

927
01:05:12,479 --> 01:05:13,447
[roars]

928
01:05:20,487 --> 01:05:21,421
[shrieks]

929
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:22,356
[screaming]

930
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:35,135
[roaring]

931
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:24,618
Okay.

932
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:25,720
So I guess the big one is mine.

933
01:06:56,784 --> 01:06:57,651
[grunts]

934
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:05,727
[Atlantean commander]
Surrender.

935
01:07:09,831 --> 01:07:10,765
Sorry.

936
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:12,365
I'm an American.

937
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:13,467
We don't do surrender.

938
01:07:29,884 --> 01:07:30,752
You okay?

939
01:07:31,551 --> 01:07:33,286
Yeah, I think so.

940
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:33,988
[grunts]

941
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:39,359
Told everyone I wasn't much use

942
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:40,762
without...

943
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:42,295
And stay still. Here.
Put pressure on it.

944
01:08:06,553 --> 01:08:07,420
[groans]

945
01:08:22,136 --> 01:08:23,303
[straining]

946
01:08:34,749 --> 01:08:36,918
Steve, what are you doing?

947
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:37,919
Whatever I can.

948
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:51,799
[Black Canary shrieks]

949
01:08:54,902 --> 01:08:56,536
Yeah. That was me.

950
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:01,575
[snarling]

951
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:02,676
[roaring]

952
01:09:07,114 --> 01:09:08,648
You call that a scream?

953
01:09:15,089 --> 01:09:15,990
[shrieking]

954
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,511
[grunts]

955
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:47,587
Perfect.

956
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,899
You know? I gotta admit.

957
01:09:57,932 --> 01:09:59,532
You're pretty tough

958
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:00,433
on the outside.

959
01:10:05,806 --> 01:10:06,874
[explosions]

960
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:19,020
[Wonder Woman straining]

961
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:21,055
[engine accelerating]

962
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:32,900
Steve?

963
01:10:32,934 --> 01:10:34,135
You okay?

964
01:10:34,168 --> 01:10:35,468
Yeah.

965
01:10:35,502 --> 01:10:36,436
[groans]

966
01:10:37,104 --> 01:10:38,139
Just need a minute.

967
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,473
Take your time.

968
01:10:40,507 --> 01:10:41,175
I got this covered.

969
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:50,450
Who dares?

970
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:51,786
[grunts]

971
01:10:53,653 --> 01:10:54,789
Steve Trevor.

972
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:56,857
Colonel in the US Army,

973
01:10:56,891 --> 01:10:58,025
Wonder Woman's boyfriend.

974
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:08,002
I admire your bravery.

975
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,939
But your fate
will be like the rest.

976
01:11:11,973 --> 01:11:14,241
You have no business
fighting with gods.

977
01:11:21,581 --> 01:11:22,917
But I do.

978
01:11:28,655 --> 01:11:29,824
[Wonder Woman] Enough of this.

979
01:11:33,094 --> 01:11:35,595
You will not win today
or any day.

980
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:39,800
The hearts of humanity
yearn for freedom

981
01:11:41,068 --> 01:11:42,970
and I aim to help them
achieve it.

982
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:46,007
Then you are a fool.

983
01:11:56,183 --> 01:11:59,153
I said enough.

984
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:34,155
What have I done?

985
01:13:06,387 --> 01:13:08,355
Oh, what just happened?

986
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:10,825
[sighing] And good riddance.

987
01:13:10,858 --> 01:13:14,261
[Advisor] You think this means
you've won?

988
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:19,266
You and your league
can't stop the <i>Fuhrer's</i> reign.

989
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,768
Can't you hear it?

990
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:22,770
The sound of defeat.

991
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:25,306
The sound of failure.

992
01:13:35,816 --> 01:13:38,786
No. No. What did you...

993
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:39,753
[blade thrusts]

994
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:46,093
Ah, I won.

995
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:48,329
I always win.

996
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,712
Steve, you okay?

997
01:14:04,745 --> 01:14:05,412
I'll be fine.

998
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:12,652
Go.

999
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,905
Mother of God.

1000
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:32,373
If those bombers
reach the city...

1001
01:14:32,406 --> 01:14:34,108
[Black Canary] We have
to do something.

1002
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,376
We can't just sit here.

1003
01:14:35,409 --> 01:14:36,744
[Wonder Woman] Where's Hawkman?

1004
01:14:38,078 --> 01:14:39,713
We might not have to.

1005
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:40,414
Look.

1006
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:44,151
What in the world?

1007
01:14:45,452 --> 01:14:47,021
No...

1008
01:14:47,054 --> 01:14:48,155
not this world.

1009
01:15:34,435 --> 01:15:35,302
[Flash] You shaved.

1010
01:15:36,503 --> 01:15:37,371
Shakespeare?

1011
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:40,007
Clark.

1012
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,475
My real name is Clark.

1013
01:15:41,508 --> 01:15:43,210
But you can call him...

1014
01:15:43,244 --> 01:15:44,111
Superman.

1015
01:15:45,312 --> 01:15:47,147
I don't understand.

1016
01:15:47,181 --> 01:15:48,782
Weren't you just a reporter?

1017
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:52,186
I was... Am.

1018
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:54,088
But I couldn't sit
on the sidelines any longer.

1019
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:57,424
I guess it was time
to get in the game.

1020
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,028
[Hourman] Diana.

1021
01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:09,837
Steve?

1022
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:14,308
Stay still.

1023
01:16:14,341 --> 01:16:15,976
We'll get a doctor. We'll...

1024
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:17,945
Ah, come on, princess.

1025
01:16:17,978 --> 01:16:20,581
We both know
that ain't happening.

1026
01:16:20,614 --> 01:16:21,482
[grunts]

1027
01:16:22,449 --> 01:16:24,885
This can't be.

1028
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:26,887
I thought when
the war was over, we'd...

1029
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,825
Tomorrow is never guaranteed.

1030
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:34,361
Only today.

1031
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:37,364
Right now.

1032
01:16:37,398 --> 01:16:39,033
That's why we fight, right?

1033
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:40,134
[coughs]

1034
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:43,971
But honestly...

1035
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:46,373
being with you...

1036
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:48,842
I wouldn't trade it for all

1037
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:50,311
the tomorrows in the world.

1038
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:54,982
So what do you say, Diana?

1039
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:58,986
Grant a dying man
his final request?

1040
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:08,395
[sighs wearily]

1041
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,368
[Wonder Woman sobbing]

1042
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:39,093
[Jay] Where's Aquaman's crony?

1043
01:17:39,126 --> 01:17:40,394
[Flash] I don't know
where he went.

1044
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:41,929
There's not a trace.

1045
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:44,298
And trust me,
this is what I do.

1046
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:45,899
It's like he just...

1047
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,267
disappeared.

1048
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:48,669
[Black Canary] Don't worry,
Future Boy.

1049
01:17:48,702 --> 01:17:49,970
We'll find him.

1050
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:51,205
Leave it to us.

1051
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:52,539
Right now,

1052
01:17:52,573 --> 01:17:54,274
we need to get you home.

1053
01:17:54,308 --> 01:17:55,175
[Wonder Woman]
Thank you...

1054
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:57,177
for everything.

1055
01:17:58,545 --> 01:18:00,147
We'll be sorry to see you go.

1056
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:05,252
Yeah. I wish
I could stay but...

1057
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:07,488
I've got a world of my own that
needs all the help it can get.

1058
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:14,161
I can't take this.

1059
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,464
You said...

1060
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:19,266
you understood why I said no.

1061
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:21,535
I was wrong.

1062
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:23,237
Don't...

1063
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:26,540
don't make the same mistake.

1064
01:18:40,587 --> 01:18:41,989
- [Jay] Ready, kid?
- [Flash] Yeah.

1065
01:19:11,452 --> 01:19:12,319
[grunts]

1066
01:19:25,065 --> 01:19:26,433
You were just... And then you...

1067
01:19:27,601 --> 01:19:29,236
I guess it doesn't matter.

1068
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:30,370
Great work, Flash.

1069
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:32,005
Thank you.

1070
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:33,140
No problem, Shakespeare.

1071
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:37,544
Uh, I mean, Superman.

1072
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:40,280
Okay.

1073
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:43,050
I should be off.

1074
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,218
Nice working with you.

1075
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:45,619
Wait.

1076
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:47,588
Listen. Brainiac won't be
the last to show up

1077
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:49,490
and threaten our cities,
our world.

1078
01:19:50,657 --> 01:19:52,292
There'll be others.

1079
01:19:52,326 --> 01:19:54,127
There always are.

1080
01:19:54,161 --> 01:19:56,263
But there are also
others like us.

1081
01:19:56,296 --> 01:19:57,799
Heroes.

1082
01:19:57,832 --> 01:20:00,234
Maybe if we stick together,
we can keep the peace.

1083
01:20:00,768 --> 01:20:02,236
You know...

1084
01:20:02,269 --> 01:20:05,339
Fight for truth, justice,
the American way.

1085
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,208
What are you suggesting?

1086
01:20:08,242 --> 01:20:09,109
Like a club?

1087
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:13,180
Yeah, something like that.

1088
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:25,359
[Iris] How long were you there?

1089
01:20:25,392 --> 01:20:26,693
[Barry] Maybe a week.

1090
01:20:26,728 --> 01:20:28,161
Here, it wasn't even a second.

1091
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:29,530
- Sounds...
- Crazy?

1092
01:20:29,563 --> 01:20:30,430
[laughs]

1093
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:32,199
A little bit.

1094
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:35,737
Yeah, it was.

1095
01:20:37,137 --> 01:20:39,306
Oh, shoot. I forgot something.

1096
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:41,675
[giggles] Glad some things
haven't changed.

1097
01:20:49,116 --> 01:20:50,450
The future is uncertain.

1098
01:20:51,886 --> 01:20:54,388
It could be full of bad things
or good things.

1099
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:56,791
But whatever the case,

1100
01:20:56,824 --> 01:20:59,693
it's better
to face it together.

1101
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:01,729
I know we said that we could
always have tomorrow,

1102
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:03,363
but whatever tomorrows I have,

1103
01:21:04,398 --> 01:21:05,632
I want them to be with you.

1104
01:21:08,302 --> 01:21:09,536
Barry.

1105
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:10,604
What are you doing?

1106
01:21:15,242 --> 01:21:16,677
So, what do you say?

1107
01:21:18,278 --> 01:21:19,146
Will you marry me?

1108
01:21:20,815 --> 01:21:23,075
[gasps] Yes.

1109
01:21:43,053 --> 01:21:48,053
