THE CLIFFS WERE ALWAYS
 MY FAVORITE PLACE

873
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,076
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER.

874
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,945
AND SOMETIMES I USED TO RUN OUT
THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

875
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,082
JUST TO SCREAM
 INTO THE WIND.

876
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:07,551
POPPA USED TO TELL ME TO
TALK TO GOD OUT THERE.

877
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:09,820
YEAH, HE TOLD ME
THAT TOO.

FOR ME NOW, SHONA.

881
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,862
AFTER I PRAYED,
EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT.
