and I kind of wanna
turn my brain off.

177
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,643
Okay.

178
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,535
[Annie] Ketchup
spelled C-a-t-c-h-e-t?

179
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:28,774
[Brian] It's a British
condiment.

180
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:30,443
[Annie] God damn it.

181
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,813
[Carrie] What is something
interesting about Annie?

182
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,083
She's good at writing music.

183
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,853
I don't know.

184
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,055
Do you think she's
not interesting?

185
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,852
[Carrie] What do you and
Annie like to do on the bus?

186
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:43,091
Oh the bus?

187
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:46,721
Oh we snack on some radishes.

188
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,968
Something that tastes like
dirt, we really like it.

189
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,740
So, yeah, we go look for
farmer's market every town

190
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,866
and try, you know,
different radishes.

191
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:01,069
[Carrie] So, Robert, what is
interesting about Annie?

192
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:02,572
Her music.

193
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:05,410
- [Carrie] Neil already said that.
- Um...

194
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,987
Her dad is in jail.

195
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,722
Okay, cut, I don't
think we should go there.

196
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,994
Okay. Not interesting?

197
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,856
Well, you know, I don't
wanna exploit her family drama

198
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:20,764
for the movie.

199
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:23,593
She's my friend,
I'm just gonna...

200
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:30,274
Let's get you telling us
something interesting about her.

201
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,001
Her music.

202
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,812
[guitar playing]

203
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,377
[Annie vocalizing]

204
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:45,883
[Carrie] That's pretty, Annie.

205
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:46,883
Is it new?

206
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,189
Yeah.

207
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:49,960
It's all right, I'm
kind of working on it.

208
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,898
It's been hard to come
up with anything lately.

209
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,803
You can write a
song for the movie.

210
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:04,738
We can track its progress.

211
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:07,072
It'd make a nice story.

212
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,639
And we kind of need a story.

213
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,210
Only if you play
a guitar solo on it.

214
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:16,949
[Carrie] Sure.

215
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:19,648
[guitar sound effect]

216
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,056
It sounds like you
already wrote one.

217
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,084
I did, [laughing],
it goes like that.

218
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,890
[laughing]

219
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,931
[Annie vocalizing]

220
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,101
<i>Hey, how's the film coming?</i>

221
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,129
<i>Documentary, that's a
big step up for you.</i>

222
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:35,134
Yeah, I hope so.

223
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:36,633
<i>You know when I tell friends</i>

224
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,168
<i>that you're working
in film now,</i>

225
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:40,241
<i>they are very impressed.</i>

226
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:44,077
Yeah, I just,
I want it to be good.

227
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:45,144
[Annie] CB, I'm
starting on abs.

228
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:48,782
Yeah, we filmed
those yesterday,

229
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:50,119
and the day before.

230
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,622
When's your next
radiation treatment?

231
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,450
<i>Um, Tuesday.</i>

232
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,694
<i>But don't worry about me.</i>

233
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,992
<i>Let's talk about this movie.</i>

234
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,756
<i>I'm so proud of you, Care.</i>

235
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:03,858
<i>Must be exciting
directing your friend.</i>

236
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,866
Yeah, it's really exciting.

237
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:16,442
♪ Free ♪

238
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,209
Okay, right there.

239
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:22,210
I love that.

240
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,178
So St. Vincent.

241
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,478
So intense.

242
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:25,779
I just want a little more

243
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:27,317
of that in the
non-concert footage.

244
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,960
Yeah, well do you really think

245
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,326
I can only be sexual
and alluring on stage?

246
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:35,857
No, but it's not the same.

247
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,331
Yeah, well, we're not
so different me and her.

248
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,665
Okay, that wasn't
what I was saying.

249
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:45,900
[gentle music]

250
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:57,285
A small part of me was
starting to second guess myself.

251
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:01,183
Am I saying the right things?

252
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,157
Do I look okay?

253
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:05,861
Is this what people
want from me?

254
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,056
I was thinking the bridge...

255
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,196
<i>One of the reasons why I
wanted to make a documentary</i>

256
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:11,598
<i>in the first place is because</i>

257
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,732
<i>I would finally be in
control of the narrative.</i>

258
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,540
How you actually seem
and how you think you seem,

259
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:22,069
like those, sometimes the
gulf is catastrophically wide.

260
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:26,910
<i>And so the idea is
to have how you sound</i>

261
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:31,350
and how you think you sound
be actually very married.

262
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:33,686
I wanted this film
to be different.

263
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:37,952
<i>I didn't wanna feel pressure
to be somebody I'm not.</i>

264
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:43,067
It's always collaboration.

265
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,069
I think the best skill
in being an artist

266
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,270
is knowing who to
collaborate with.

267
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,138
You don't own it,
it's not about you,

268
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:53,711
and at its best this feels like

269
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,379
this very ego-less experience.

270
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,749
[Annie] And I don't know if what
constitutes important artist is

271
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,317
necessarily good art.

272
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:03,584
I mean, that puts a huge
premium on the present tense.

273
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,150
[Holly] But what litmus test
do we have other than now?

274
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,982
We have what lasts.

275
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:12,130
We have what really
moves people's hearts.

276
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,956
I mean half the time
people don't even realize

277
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:17,262
that it's wonderful until
like generations later,

278
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,501
and then it's super revered.

279
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,599
Um.

280
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,768
Is everything okay?

281
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:24,839
I'm sorry, I'm just
getting these weird texts

282
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,574
from my girlfriend.

283
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:27,672
Oh.

284
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:34,076
I think she's
breaking up with me.

285
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:35,185
Oh God.

286
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:40,652
I was doing a magazine
feature in London,

287
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:43,460
and I stayed and went
to Paris fashion week,

288
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,557
and...

289
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,430
I've been gone for like a month.

290
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:53,293
Am I a terrible person?

291
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:55,271
No.

292
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,466
No, you're just doing
whatever you have to do.

293
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:00,936
Yeah, I guess.

294
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:06,651
You're not a terrible person.

295
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,449
You're not, I promise.

296
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,491
Would you record a
message for her for me?

297
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,817
Uh, sure.

298
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,852
My girlfriend does
not trust me right now,

299
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,355
but she's a huge,
huge fan of yours,

300
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:20,626
and she would trust you

301
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:22,390
if you told her that
I was a good person.

302
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,497
Uh, yeah.

303
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,332
Hey, this is Annie Clark,

304
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,235
and I just wanted to...

305
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:30,500
Oh, can you say St. Vincent,

306
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,201
then she'll know who you are.

307
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,309
Right.

308
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:37,874
Hey, this is St. Vincent,

309
00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:42,379
and I just wanted to say
that your girlfriend...

310
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:43,678
[whispers]
Holly.

311
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,080
Holly, uh, loves you very much,

312
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:52,086
and she's so sorry
that she has been gone

313
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,859
so often...

314
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:56,766
Would you also say that
she shouldn't give up on me,

315
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,434
and that there is nobody

316
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:03,398
who's gonna love her
the way I love her?

317
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,403
[phone beeping]

318
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:08,235
And don't give up hope on her,

319
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:12,810
because nobody's gonna love
you as much as she does.

320
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:16,084
Okay, well, I'm really sorry.

321
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:17,445
I hope everything works out.

322
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:18,716
No, me too.

323
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:21,522
Should we get back
to the interview?

324
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:23,284
I think we're good.

325
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:24,388
Really?

326
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,354
That was great, yeah.

327
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:26,091
That was it?

328
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,862
Yeah, thank you.

329
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:27,755
Yeah, you know what,

330
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:29,291
actually, my cousin lives here,

331
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,869
and your people only gave you
one ticket to Saturday night.

332
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,269
Do you think you could maybe

333
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,902
look into getting
a plus one for me?

334
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:36,904
Sure.

335
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:38,302
Thank you.

336
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,134
[Holly] Muah! Thank you.

337
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,543
Bye.

338
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,383
Wow.

339
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,942
Uh, that woman, she didn't
listen to anything I said.

340
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:50,479
I know, but you
still did her a favor,

341
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,448
because you're too nice.

342
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,754
Stop being so nice.

343
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:57,254
I'm not getting her
stupid cousin into the show.

344
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:58,090
[Carrie] Good.

345
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,421
Yeah, don't.

346
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,693
But can you?

347
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:05,159
I don't want her
to be mad at me.

348
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:09,767
You can cut.

349
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:13,002
When she's not on
screen you can cut.

350
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,343
[Carrie]
I like that, yeah.

351
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:19,245
Conjuring sort of a Patsy Cline.

352
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:21,275
[Annie]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

353
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:23,786
I feel like, uh...
I was thinking about, like, uh,

354
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,481
some croonery.

355
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,181
Like... [vocalizing]

356
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,927
That's nice.

357
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:41,334
Ah nice.

358
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:44,242
And then it would be something.

00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:51,508

00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:56,254
kind of like [vocalizing].

363
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:02,386
Yeah, I like it.

364
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:03,453
Yeah, that's cool.

365
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,290

367
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:07,854

should it be about?

370
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,229
That's up to you.

371
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:22,975
I mean the alienation
of touring.

372
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:24,411
No.

373
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,345
Yeah, that's not
that relatable.

374
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:29,579
I mean, heartbreak.

375
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:31,487
No, that is very cloying.

376
00:21:34,488 --> 00:21:35,985
But your call, your call.

377
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:39,253
What about that, just,
well of sorrow

378
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,558
that everybody has from
like childhood trauma?

379
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:44,225
That's very dark,

380
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:47,701

they, they're great.

00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,269

Hi.

407
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:20,589
How is it?

408
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:22,796

Are you sure?

411
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,512
Okay, I was thinking,

412
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,438
is there a way to
heighten it a little?

413
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:41,584
You're nerdy and normal in
real life, which I love,

414
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,521
but the disparity between that

415
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,520
and who you are onstage
is kind of jarring,

416
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:50,758
you know what I'm saying?

417
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:56,633
I just wanted to give
you guys a little bit

418
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,360
of a heads up that Carrie
and I have been talking,

419
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:01,504
and we think that I
should veer more towards

420
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,870
my onstage persona
for the documentary.

421
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:06,008
[Robert] So should
we call you St. Vincent?

422
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:07,011
Oh God no.

423
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,906
Wait, CB, should they?

00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,144
[Carrie] Uh, I
think Annie's okay.

425
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:10,838
[Annie] Yeah.

426
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,741
I can do an accent.

No, no, no.

00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:16,350
Oh.

00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:17,682
No, please, go for it.

432
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,221
Look at the size of that one.

433
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,593
That's good, but no.

434
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:26,025
It's just about me making
some subtle changes

435
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:28,996
so that I can be a little
bit more interesting.

436
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:29,858
Exactly.

437
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,567
How about in your new role

438
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:35,000
you do a formal
introduction of the band.

439
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:40,434
And everyone we're gonna
look to the camera.

440
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:48,178
This is Toko, she's Japanese.

00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,552
Hi.

442
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:53,187
[Annie] And this
is Neil, he's Neil.

443
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:54,723
Good day.

444
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,718
And this is Robert, the
skins man of the group.

00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,023
Hello.

446
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,796
Or in lay people's
terms, the drummer.

447
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:05,800
Um,

448
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:11,436
we got it.

449
00:25:11,505 --> 00:25:12,601
Yeah, we got it.

450
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,235
Great.

451
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,613
Toko's cat got
eaten by a coyote,

452
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,882
and Robert's wife
had a breeched birth.

453
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:23,620
The umbilical cord was wrapped
around the baby's neck,

454
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,056
like it was trying to
hang itself in utero.

455
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,883
And that was after what,

456
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:29,692
multiple miscarriages.

457
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:41,231
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry you guys.

458
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,636
Toko, I didn't mean
to call you Japanese.

459
00:25:45,705 --> 00:25:48,768
[Neil] Toko is Japanese.

460
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:53,507
I was thinking maybe this
should just be a concert film.

461
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,849
Because I can't be
who you want me to be.

462
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,120
No, because what
you do on stage

463
00:26:00,189 --> 00:26:04,692
is really hard to duplicate
off stage, and that's okay.

464
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:06,696
I can be St.
Vincent all the time.

465
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:08,698
[Carrie] No, Annie,
I was saying I'm wrong.

466
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,624
Let's protect the fact
that you're normal,

467
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:14,634
that your life isn't crazy
or interesting enough

468
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,201

00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:47,855
[Sarah] Yeah.

00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:50,801
Very good.

493
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,365
I bet Annie asked people
to give us the good wine.

494
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:57,239
She was trying really hard
to impress me the other day.

495
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,802
Is she nice?

496
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:00,234
No, she's a snob.

497
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:04,738

to punch me in the face.

you're making her

502
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,148
way more interesting
than she is.

503
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:16,893

504
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,460

you show up late, right?

505

That's something.

506

right about that.

This is a little frustrating.

509

I don't wanna waste
16mm film,

a little distance she'll...

00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:12,006
[Carrie] No, no, we're
set up for the live show.

514

Don't worry.

515
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:17,649
No, no, no, I want them
here now, I changed my mind.

516
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:18,756
[Carrie] Yes.

517
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:21,988
Ask me a question.

518
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:22,854
[Carrie] What
kind of question?

519
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:24,795
Any fucking question.

520
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,658
[Carrie] Annie, what's
going through your mind?

521
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:32,396
How it doesn't matter how
I feel on any given night.

522
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:34,198
That no matter what I
owe it all to my fans

523
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:36,965
to give them my blood,
sweat and tears.

524
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:37,868
[Carrie] Great.

525
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:39,869
No, I can do it better.

526
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:40,572
Let's go.

527
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:41,344
Okay.

528
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,069
I guess we're resetting.

529
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:43,072
Back to one.

530
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:46,740

[knocking on door]

895
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:54,320
Uncle Pete?

896
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:56,696
Yep.

897
00:53:56,765 --> 00:53:59,461
<i>I mean, he sounded decent
last time we talked.</i>

898
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:01,928
Well, he's holding up.

899
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:04,531
Mainly, I think he's
just depressed.

900
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,101
You know your dad,

901
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,372
he doesn't like having to
count on anybody else for help.

902
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:09,507
I mean, I tried to visit him

903
00:54:09,576 --> 00:54:10,340
when we went through
the Northwest,

904
00:54:10,408 --> 00:54:12,340
but this tour has been

905
00:54:12,409 --> 00:54:13,772
kind of crazy.

906
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,645
Hey, I gotta tell you,

907
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:19,317
this documentary
you're working on,

908
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:22,348
it's really lifted his spirits.

909
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:24,557
Now this will be a little
embarrassing to hear maybe,

910
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:27,329
but every doctor and
nurse at that hospital

911
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:31,123
knows all about his
daughter, the director.

912
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:32,961
I have done other
things, you know?

913
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,529
[Pete] I know, I know,
but this is different.

914
00:54:35,598 --> 00:54:37,462
This is artistic.

915
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:38,638
Yes.

916
00:54:38,707 --> 00:54:41,038
He's just bragging a
little because he loves ya.

917
00:54:41,107 --> 00:54:42,009
Right.

918
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,411
Your dad, he keeps saying,

919
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,447
I gotta be healthy in
time for the premier.

920
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:50,647
When is the premier, by the way?

921
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:53,713
Well, we'd have
to finish the movie

922
00:54:53,782 --> 00:54:56,017
for there to be a premier.

923
00:54:57,284 --> 00:54:59,521
Well, I guess I'm
just here to tell you

924
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:03,226
to finish your movie.

925
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:05,862
[dramatic music]

926
00:55:25,646 --> 00:55:26,685
Annie?

927
00:55:27,649 --> 00:55:30,282
[dramatic music]

928
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:51,743
Hi Carrie.

929
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:01,148
Are you ready to get to work?

930
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,019
Yes.

931
00:56:05,687 --> 00:56:08,320
[dramatic music]

932
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:13,369
I want a sensory experience.

933
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,664
I wanna bridge the gap

934
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:19,341
between audience and performer.

935
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,175
I'm no longer
interested in gestures

936
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,472
that come solely from the stage.

937
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:25,575
The audience cheers,

938
00:56:25,644 --> 00:56:27,446
that's all the gesture you need.

939
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:29,441
Cheering is born
of expectation.

940
00:56:29,509 --> 00:56:32,917
It's the audience performing
being an audience.

941
00:56:32,985 --> 00:56:35,519
You're playing the
biggest shows of your life,

942
00:56:35,588 --> 00:56:37,015
why do you wanna sabotage it?

943
00:56:37,084 --> 00:56:40,292
I want to disrupt the senses.

944
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:42,924
How are you gonna do that?

945
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:46,466
By finally
admitting the truth.

946
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:49,503
That the audience
doesn't need me,

947
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,971
I'm just a vessel
for their feelings.

948
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,545
Also, this is the only item
I'll be selling at my shows.

949
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:06,422
[crowd clamoring]

950
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:15,431
[dramatic music]

951
00:57:23,704 --> 00:57:25,366
[Audience Member]
Say something.

952
00:57:25,435 --> 00:57:26,475
No.

953
00:57:30,278 --> 00:57:31,843
[psychedelic music]

954
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:41,413
<i>Slipping into this
new mode was freeing.</i>

956
00:58:03,574 --> 00:58:06,339
[Annie laughing]

957
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:10,717
[Man] <i>Carrie, give a thought.</i>

958
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,346
[Carrie, echoing]
<i>How am I gonna learn?</i>

959
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:24,633
<i>I feel like I'm in, I'm in
the failure era of my life,</i>

960
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,628
<i>where people don't like
the shit I'm doing.</i>

961
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:28,569
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

962
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,600
<i>People don't like
what I'm doing.</i>

963
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:32,637
<i>I'm grappling.</i>

964
00:58:32,705 --> 00:58:34,906
<i>But what's weird is I claim,</i>

965
00:58:36,604 --> 00:58:38,744
<i>and I can't even tell
if it's real anymore.</i>

966
00:58:38,813 --> 00:58:41,617
<i>I do think that
the artist's role,</i>

967
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,585
<i>the writer's role
is to thrash around,</i>

968
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:46,650
<i>to make mistakes,
to be out of step.</i>

969
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:48,819
<i>But then when I am out of step,</i>

970
00:58:48,888 --> 00:58:51,123
- <i>I feel terrible.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

971
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:55,759
<i>You know, when I'm out of step
with what people like,</i>

972
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:58,423
<i>then I feel down on myself.</i>

973
00:58:58,492 --> 00:59:01,402
<i>But I, but
philosophically, I think</i>

974
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,402
<i>no, that's how it should be.</i>

975
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:06,634
<i>I don't know.</i>

976
00:59:06,702 --> 00:59:10,777
<i>I kind of think I just wanna
make things with friends.</i>

977
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,509
<i>It's beautiful today.</i>

978
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,728
[upbeat music]

979
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:45,042
Hey, Carrie, where's your wig?

980
00:59:46,578 --> 00:59:48,881
[upbeat music]

981
00:59:50,714 --> 00:59:51,752
[Annie]
CB.

982
00:59:56,853 --> 00:59:58,785
Where's your wig?

983
00:59:58,854 --> 01:00:01,553

984
01:00:16,036 --> 01:00:17,613
[gentle music]

985
01:00:24,485 --> 01:00:26,314
We're in this together.

986
01:00:29,883 --> 01:00:30,923
Are we?

987
01:00:31,888 --> 01:00:33,354
Mm-hmm, me and me.

988
01:00:34,758 --> 01:00:37,292
[upbeat music]

989
01:00:43,768 --> 01:00:44,996
[Woman] There she is.

990
01:00:45,065 --> 01:00:47,599
[dramatic music]

01:00:52,909 --> 01:00:55,607

<i>Hey, Care, it's Dad.</i>

993
01:01:12,963 --> 01:01:15,233
<i>It's been a rough week,</i>

994
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:17,364
<i>but your uncle told me
that you seemed good.</i>

995
01:01:17,433 --> 01:01:20,766
<i>And I can't wait
to see the movie.</i>

996
01:01:20,835 --> 01:01:22,605
<i>Honey, I am just so
happy that you're finally</i>

997
01:01:22,674 --> 01:01:27,144
<i>doing the kind of work that
you were always meant to do.</i>

998
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:31,247
[gentle music]

999
01:01:48,697 --> 01:01:52,873
Um, so, Annie has asked
that I do a formal interview

1000
01:01:57,006 --> 01:01:57,836
with the two of you.

1001
01:01:57,905 --> 01:01:58,641
Mm-hmm.

1002
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:59,944
Cool, great.

1003
01:02:00,013 --> 01:02:01,606
I think it's the
first time we've ever

1004
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:03,910
gone on the record
about our relationship.

1005
01:02:03,979 --> 01:02:05,343
Mm, mm-hmm.

1006
01:02:05,412 --> 01:02:06,817
Yeah, well, the live sex act

1007
01:02:06,886 --> 01:02:08,279
you had me shoot the other night

1008
01:02:08,348 --> 01:02:10,915
felt pretty on the record.

1009
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:12,024
Thanks.

1010
01:02:14,529 --> 01:02:15,963
How did you meet?

1011
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:20,263
Oh, well, we connected
on a very personal level.

1012
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:23,834
Through our agents.

1013
01:02:23,903 --> 01:02:24,837
I wasn't even gay at the time.

1014
01:02:24,906 --> 01:02:27,776
Nuh-uh, I turned
her gay. [laughing]

1015
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,702
That's very inspirational...
for someone.

1016
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:37,313
How do relationships play
into the creative process?

1017
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:41,817
So much of what I write
is fueled by romance.

1018
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:43,782
The good, the bad.

1019
01:02:43,851 --> 01:02:48,026
For example, when I was
working on "Mass Seduction,"

1020
01:02:48,095 --> 01:02:49,992
I was... you know,
I was going through

1021
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:51,832
a really hard time in my life,

1022
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:56,496
but what I learned
was that sometimes

1023
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:59,599
you have to go to
the depth of despair

1024
01:03:01,371 --> 01:03:04,241
in order to extract
something true.

1025
01:03:05,873 --> 01:03:07,310
I don't think I could
even write another record

1026
01:03:07,378 --> 01:03:10,644
without having my heart
totally ripped out.

1027
01:03:10,713 --> 01:03:11,885
Well, maybe you just have
to write this next one

1028
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,021
about being really
happy and content.

1029
01:03:17,392 --> 01:03:19,017
Yeah.

1030
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:19,986
Baby?

1031
01:03:20,055 --> 01:03:21,056
[Dakota] Mm-hmm.

1032
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:23,755
I wanted to propose something.

1033
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:26,494
What?

1034
01:03:27,461 --> 01:03:29,761
Right now?
On... on camera?

1035
01:03:31,131 --> 01:03:32,704
Oh my God.

1036
01:03:32,772 --> 01:03:34,634
I wanted to propose...

1037
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,540
that we break up
in a few months.

1038
01:03:43,851 --> 01:03:45,714
I know it seems really sudden.

1039
01:03:45,783 --> 01:03:46,853
What?

1040
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:49,590
And believe me,
I am so happy with you,

1041
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,924
it's just that I'm too happy,

1042
01:03:51,993 --> 01:03:53,555
and I've got another
record to write.

1043
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:56,187
And if I don't, you know,
really shake things up,

1044
01:03:56,256 --> 01:03:57,457
I'm gonna be...

1045
01:03:57,526 --> 01:03:59,725
- What?
- Yeah, I won't be able to...

1046
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:05,565
- Why are you doing this?
- We can do it any way you want.

1047
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,370
I mean, it doesn't
have to be some, like...

1048
01:04:07,438 --> 01:04:10,039
outside a night club
or on a red carpet.

1049
01:04:10,108 --> 01:04:13,080
It could be just the two of us

1050
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:15,148
in the hotel room
just screaming at each other,

1051
01:04:15,216 --> 01:04:17,947
or, I don't know, or maybe
your parents would come.

1052
01:04:18,016 --> 01:04:19,715
No, I don't wanna do that.

1053
01:04:19,784 --> 01:04:22,983
You're the only person I have
ever wanted to do this with.

1054
01:04:23,052 --> 01:04:23,921
This is crazy,

1055
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,919
why don't we just break up now?

1056
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:26,053
Let's do that.

1057
01:04:26,122 --> 01:04:27,120
- No.
- Yeah.

1058
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:28,224
- No.
- Yeah.

1059
01:04:28,293 --> 01:04:30,058
- Because I love you.
- You do?

1060
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:31,061
- Yes.
- Really?

1061
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,128
Yes.
And I'm still on tour.

1062
01:04:33,197 --> 01:04:34,295
And I like having you around.

1063
01:04:34,363 --> 01:04:37,103
God, Annie that
is so fucked up.

1064
01:04:41,073 --> 01:04:41,972
I'm sorry if this doesn't align

1065
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:44,077
with your artistic process.

1066
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:48,884
Goodbye, Annie.

1067
01:04:50,046 --> 01:04:51,110

one was actually really good.

Yeah, it looked

I just wanted to
show you the options

for the role of
director for tomorrow.

Oh, perfect.

CB, I hope you don't mind,

1278
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:39,565
but I asked Kayla to help us out

1279
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,064
with casting the director.

1280
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:42,529
Honestly, I would
have asked you,

1281
01:20:42,597 --> 01:20:44,532
but you were so busy
with your shot list.

1282
01:20:44,601 --> 01:20:46,867

to be in the narrative film.

think you can fire me,

playing your assistant.
