2
00:02:56,238 --> 00:03:00,659
Forgive this man, found guilty here
of collaboration with the enemy.

3
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:04,538
May God have mercy on your soul.

4
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:06,707
Amen.

5
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:15,632
Attention!

6
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:19,887
Make ready! Aim!

7
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:23,223
Fire!

8
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,253
- Has it arrived? Is it here?
- Last night.

9
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:57,049
- Jerome, good work on those etchings.
- I aim to please.

10
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,134
There's a gift on your desk.
Cherries for the family.

11
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:01,929
I'll try not to eat them
before I get home this time. Thank you.

12
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:11,313
A Dutch Jew with a Canadian uniform.

13
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:14,733
Captain. Captain Piller.

14
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,193
Who let this one in?

15
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:23,200
Dekker, this is Minna.
Minna, this is Dekker.

16
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:25,285
- Hello, Minna. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

17
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:27,830
We used to be in the Resistance together.

18
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:30,332
Yeah, but he couldn't resist anything
without me.

19
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:35,963
- Working with the Allies now.
- Yes.

20
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,548
Everything in here was stolen,

21
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:41,093
and they put me in charge
of finding out who took it

22
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:42,678
and who sold it to the Nazis.

23
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:47,182
But I want to avoid interference
from the Ministry of Justice

24
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:50,686
'cause they seem to have their own agenda,
and that's why I need you.

25
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,896
I need someone I can trust.

26
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,109
Well, anything for an old friend.
But do I have to wear a uniform?

27
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:58,861
Oh, yeah, it's one of the perks.

28
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:04,116
This was just found
in Göring's hidden collection.

29
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,744
<i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i> It's a Vermeer.

30
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:11,623
- Vermeer!
- And... we found a letter.

31
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,667
Folded in the crate.

32
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,214
I attended a show there once,

33
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:22,009
had champagne and smoked salmon,

34
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:24,052
and saw some terrible paintings.

35
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:26,263
And what Germans did you meet there?

36
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:28,724
I shook a hand or two.

37
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,352
Those pigs were everywhere.
You couldn't avoid them.

38
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,939
I never had that problem.

39
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:37,691
No, me neither.

40
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:41,195
I'm a personal friend of Prince Bernhard

41
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:43,572
and the commander
of the Ministry of Justice.

42
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:45,157
That's very good for you,

43
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,202
but I don't work for the Dutch government
who ran off when things got hot.

44
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,871
Dekker, will you please go sit down?

45
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:59,004
I was commissioned by the Allied Command.

46
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:02,341
Who will soon relinquish power
to the rightful Dutch government.

47
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,842
But not today.

48
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:05,594
And the more time I waste on you,

49
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:09,306
the Nazi sympathizers
you drank champagne with will slip away.

50
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,183
I'm afraid I must ask you to...

51
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:17,105
In this letter,
the owner of the Goudstikker Gallery

52
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:22,152
references you in verifying
the background of a Vermeer painting...

53
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:23,529
I don't collect art.

54
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:27,282
...before Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring
agreed to buy it.

55
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,334
<i>Christ and the Adulteress</i> was
just recovered from a railway car

56
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,086
in an Austrian salt mine.

57
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:40,879
Thing about Göring...

58
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:44,550
he kept meticulous records
of all his acquisitions.

59
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:48,470
So, now, tell me about this letter.

60
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:53,892
It was a favor.

61
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,229
I had a respectable name.

62
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:02,067
I simply wrote that I'd vouch
for the painting's provenance

63
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,193
to finalize the sale.

64
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,988
Because the painting had been stolen
from Jews?

65
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:09,366
Who was the favor for?

66
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:13,704
Who brought you the painting?

67
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:15,164
Han Van Meegeren.

68
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:49,865
Han Van Meegeren?

69
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:52,743
Indeed.

70
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:55,996
I'm Captain Joseph Piller
of the Allied Provisional Government.

71
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:59,208
- Please, come in, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

72
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:09,718
Were you expecting us?

73
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:13,138
In these times, one expects anything.

74
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,307
Do you play?

75
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,226
No, not anymore.

76
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,981
- May I offer you a drink?
- Yes.

77
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,149
No, thanks.

78
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,153
No?

79
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,787
Do you live here all by yourself?

80
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,748
For the time being.
I am recently divorced.

81
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:41,500
This is my wife's house now.

82
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:46,255
She is in France,
and the housekeeper went back to Utrecht.

83
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:48,215
The war has been good to you, huh?

84
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:52,052
I was lucky enough to sell
a series of Flemish primitives

85
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:53,846
before hostilities broke out.

86
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:55,429
So, you're an art dealer?

87
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:58,350
I am a painter and an art lover.

88
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:02,062
But, of course,
I take my opportunities where I can.

89
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:04,523
And during the war, what did you do?

90
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:06,692
Tried to survive, like everybody else.

91
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,986
Running out of champagne
must have been devastating.

92
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:12,281
Oh, not as bad as running out of caviar.
Shall we sit?

93
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:14,575
No, no, we're taking a walk.

94
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:17,035
Do I need a jacket?

95
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,794
You haven't asked why I'm here.

96
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:29,506
Well, I find that in life, as in art,

97
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,176
it's always best
not to spoil the surprise.

98
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:35,012
Or maybe it's no surprise at all.

99
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:39,975
Shall we?

100
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:48,252
- <i>Do you like Johannes Vermeer?</i>
- <i>Of course.</i>

101
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:51,213
<i>The equal of Rembrandt, superior to Hals,</i>

102
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:54,341
<i>and only a hair
behind Michelangelo and da Vinci.</i>

103
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:57,886
And this one, <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

104
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,179
How does that rate?

105
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:03,142
Undoubtedly a masterpiece.

106
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,979
It has his hallmark command
of light and color

107
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:12,192
and yet with a gravitas absent
from his more celebrated work.

108
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:14,653
You take interest in art as well as music?

109
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,530
Oh, no, no, no.

110
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:21,451
What interests me is that it was sold
to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring

111
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:24,037
for more than 1.5 million guilders,

112
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:28,750
which is the largest sum ever paid
for a work of art.

113
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:32,337
Which proves
that pigs can sometimes have taste.

114
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,214
Or perhaps too much money.

115
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:39,094
I've traced the sale
back to the Goudstikker Gallery,

116
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:42,764
through a network
of your associates, to you.

117
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:49,104
I need to know
where this Vermeer came from.

118
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:52,691
Was it from a looted collection?
Jews trying to flee Europe?

119
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:59,114
Mr. Van Meegeren, as you know,

120
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,744
collaboration with the enemy
is a capital offense.

121
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:06,455
They're shooting people
in the streets daily.

122
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,291
We all must die sometime.

123
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:14,296
Although Vermeer, Hals, Bosch,
they live forever.

124
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,340
They speak to us across the centuries.

125
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:18,592
But you're not among those names,
are you...

126
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:20,969
Mr. Van Meegeren?

127
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:25,224
So, you must have made
your fortune some other way.

128
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:29,853
And what, may I ask,
will be your great legacy, Captain Piller?

129
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:32,064
Putting you and your friends in jail.

130
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:33,565
Or in a noose.

131
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:37,110
This is your chance at redemption

132
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:40,823
and perhaps, more importantly, survival.

133
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:46,787
And yet I am sensing that perhaps
it is you who needs redemption, no?

134
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,262
Put him in solitary.

135
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,223
Single rations. No visitors.

136
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:47,347
- Finn, want to help me?
- Sure, Papa.

137
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:53,937
- Take these.
- Okay.

138
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:57,191
And they go into these.

139
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:13,916
<i>Only I can paint the picture
that you so desperately want to see.</i>

140
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:20,214
And what is it
that I so desperately want to see?

141
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:23,258
You want justice against the wicked, yes?

142
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:27,179
So, you're going to need me.

143
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,433
But I ask a favor.
I need my paints. I need my brushes.

144
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,894
- Please, send me home...
- I'll have them brought here.

145
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,980
There is no life here, no inspiration.

146
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:40,776
Do you want inspiration?

147
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:45,697
What do you need inspiration for
if I break your hands?

148
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:07,219
Piller?

149
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:10,305
I'm Detective De Klerks.

150
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,725
Ministry of Justice. Long time.

151
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:17,980
I've heard you snagged a big fish,
a Van Meegeren. Is that right?

152
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:21,108
- Who told you?
- Jungle drum, you know.

153
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:22,609
We need to question him.

154
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:29,575
We're on the same team.
We need to share information.

155
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:31,910
Are we on the same team?

156
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:35,747
Last time I handed over a lead,
he somehow slipped away.

157
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,166
The old boys' network.

158
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:41,837
Perhaps they should rename your outfit
the Ministry of Convenient Justice.

159
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,467
You and me, we're just foot soldiers.

160
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,510
We don't have to worry
about the big picture.

161
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:52,306
I see. Well, keep your attention
on your feet, then.

162
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:55,601
Excuse me. What were you before the war?

163
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:57,853
A tailor, right?

164
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:00,314
I've been a police investigator
for 15 years,

165
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:02,441
and this could be bigger
than some paintings.

166
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:05,819
This Van Meegeren may have helped fund
the Abwehr spy ring,

167
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,404
laundering money for the Nazis.

168
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,866
Even more reason your department
should stay away from this.

169
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,118
All this bluster and confidence, Piller,

170
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:16,121
it's a pretty good mask,
but you're in over your head here.

171
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,415
Yeah. And you know it.

172
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,085
Actually, I don't need your permission
to see Van Meegeren.

173
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:23,378
I was just being courteous.

174
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:26,006
This is a joint jurisdiction facility,

175
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:31,136
and I have a signed order here
from the Dutch government

176
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,138
granting me your fish.

177
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:37,100
So, in fact, we'll take it from here.

178
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:56,286
Ministry of Justice.

179
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,211
Boys.

180
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:24,982
Dekker? Dekker!

181
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,192
Get him out.

182
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:34,825
- Time for exercise. Come on.
- What?

183
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:35,909
- Come on.
- Come on.

184
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:38,412
Get him out of there.

185
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:01,310
This way.

186
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,771
Hey!

187
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:11,528
Piller!

188
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:20,329
Not that I didn't enjoy it,
but what the hell did we just do?

189
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:24,625
De Klerks wants him,
but no one takes my fish.

190
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:28,378
Your fish? How flattering.

191
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:42,893
Very beautiful, Joe.

192
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,402
Yes.

193
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:56,573
Well, splendid.
I can definitely paint in here.

194
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,283
As long as you're happy...

195
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,829
I'll make a list of my supplies.

196
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:04,790
My assistant, Cootje, knows
where everything is in my studio.

197
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:06,375
And I'm going to need my whiskey.

198
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,461
I'll get your paints.
Forget about the whiskey.

199
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:12,756
And, please, don't play games with me.

200
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,760
Mr. Dekker here has my permission
to break both your legs

201
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,011
if you try and escape.

202
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,848
May I borrow your notepad and pen?

203
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,607
You are going to need to find this man.

204
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,238
Theo Wijngaarden.

205
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:38,198
Why? Who's he?

206
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:41,326
He's the most important player
in this little game.

207
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:45,164
Do you want your paints or not?

208
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,667
Yes, and in return, all will be revealed.

209
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,671
I believe Theo should be in Amsterdam.
I don't know. But you need to find him.

210
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,092
Don't let him out of your sight.

211
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,388
<i>This is outrageous!</i>

212
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:05,767
Han Van Meegeren is instrumental
to our case. We have every right...

213
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,145
His lackey, De Klerks,
tried to steal my prisoner.

214
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:09,062
Enough.

215
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,902
Where'd you serve in the war?

216
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:17,821
- Don't see what that has to do with this.
- Answer the question.

217
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:23,285
London. Helping Holland's efforts
to the best of my ability.

218
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:25,996
Get the hell out of my office.

219
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:38,634
Thank you.

220
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,971
He'll be back.
Allied Command is coming to an end.

221
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:46,975
And Theo Wijngaarden, what about him?

222
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,435
I'll put it out on the wire.

223
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,109
Joe.

224
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:58,779
Ease up.

225
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:02,282
You're not going to get
every single one of them.

226
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:17,548
I had a call from the Ministry of Justice.

227
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,175
They're taking you
off their Christmas list.

228
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,553
Yeah, we don't have much time.

229
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,763
We need to keep up the search
for Theo Wijngaarden.

230
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:27,474
And let's put more pressure
on Van Meegeren.

231
00:21:30,894 --> 00:21:31,979
<i>Maybe I can help.</i>

232
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:37,025
- You want to have a go at him?
- Yeah. I can rough him up a little.

233
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:41,113
What? I'm not saying
it's going to be pretty, but...

234
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,447
And here I was thinking

235
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:45,492
that you're just a nice, quiet girl
from The Hague.

236
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:48,996
We need to find Van Meegeren's wife.

237
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:51,456
- Yes.
- Right.

238
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,417
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

239
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:13,145
Hello.

240
00:22:14,271 --> 00:22:15,272
Who was that?

241
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,108
That's Minna. That's my assistant.

242
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:20,777
She's helping me
with the Van Meegeren case.

243
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,071
She's very pretty.

244
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:26,909
Is she? I hadn't noticed.

245
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:29,870
Must make the long hours so much easier.

246
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,123
Do you want to talk about
your long hours during the war?

247
00:22:39,254 --> 00:22:40,547
That's not fair, Joe.

248
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:55,354
Hey, boys. Looking to buy some art?

249
00:22:57,022 --> 00:23:00,651
We are crazy for art.
Love to take a peek at what you have.

250
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:02,110
Well, we're closed now.

251
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,946
Which means...

252
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:08,867
take your boy scouts and fuck off.

253
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:17,793
Tell your tailor he'll be sewing
prison uniforms for the next 40 years

254
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,045
when I'm done with him, will you?

255
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:24,049
Good dog.

256
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,801
Let's go.

257
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:30,097
Anything else we can get you?

258
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:32,015
A drink would be nice.

259
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,979
And who's she?

260
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:39,940
This is my assistant, Cootje Henning.

261
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:42,401
Cootje, meet my jailer, Joseph.

262
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,695
I have to run.

263
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:49,825
Next time, I'll try to bring your whiskey.

264
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:51,201
Yes, if you could.

265
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:54,663
She's not your assistant, is she?
She's your goddamn girlfriend.

266
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:56,248
Little bit of both.

267
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,461
She brought the paints.

268
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:04,756
When she took her clothes off,
you know, what was I supposed to do?

269
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:08,635
Miss Henning, wait up. I'd like a word.

270
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,554
I'm late meeting my husband.

271
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:12,973
Han knows where to find me.

272
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,768
All for art, I assure you.

273
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:21,231
- We're wasting time, Joe.
- No, you're wasting my time.

274
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:23,233
Theo Wijngaarden can't be found.

275
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:27,321
I don't imagine you've heard of a painter
by the name of Willem Gillisz Kool.

276
00:24:27,404 --> 00:24:28,906
No, I haven't.

277
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:32,868
Kool created hundreds
of beautiful works three centuries ago,

278
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:35,412
and not one of them is worth
the canvas they're painted on.

279
00:24:35,496 --> 00:24:38,081
Listen, I'm not interested in art history.

280
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:39,791
Vermeer, on the other hand,

281
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,835
paints just over 30 pictures
his whole career,

282
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,670
each worth a staggering fortune.

283
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:45,881
- Do you know why?
- No, and I don't care.

284
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:47,174
You should.

285
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:51,178
You think you're investigating art,
but you're investigating money and power.

286
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:52,721
Then get on with it.

287
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:58,352
Somebody decides.
A so-called expert, a critic.

288
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:03,148
They proclaim that this is genius,
this is important, this is art.

289
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,777
And so a legend begins
and a legend builds.

290
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:11,365
Wealthy merchants see their chance
to become cultured by owning it,

291
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:15,494
museums fight to put it on their walls,
and so it goes, on and on.

292
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,123
When I was a boy,
my father used to beat me for painting.

293
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,503
<i>Even though it was
the only passion in life I had.</i>

294
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:28,674
But I took my beatings.

295
00:25:28,757 --> 00:25:31,802
And when I could,
I moved away from home to Paris

296
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:32,928
and I painted even more.

297
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:35,556
I drank too much,
I slept with too few women,

298
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,307
and I eventually went insane.

299
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:41,812
One very stormy night,
about to leap off the Eiffel Tower,

300
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:43,939
a crack in the heavens opened.

301
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:48,068
It could have been the absinthe,
but I swore I glimpsed the Almighty.

302
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:50,654
I very quickly came back to Holland,

303
00:25:50,737 --> 00:25:54,867
and in a raging fever of creation,
I painted for months without sleep.

304
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:57,244
Finally, when I collapsed,

305
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:01,623
I wept for days, beholding my work.

306
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:07,254
I had captured my soul on canvas,
snatched perfection from the gods.

307
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:12,968
An influential friend immediately arranged
an exhibit at the Biesling Gallery.

308
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:15,596
And the entire community was buzzing

309
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,600
that a new, important artistic voice
had risen.

310
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:22,561
<i>All of Amsterdam was there.</i>

311
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:25,063
<i>I can still hear the chatter,</i>

312
00:26:25,147 --> 00:26:27,649
<i>smell the perfume
of all those beautiful women</i>

313
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,568
<i>who suddenly realized I existed.</i>

314
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:34,990
<i>The energy was palpable,
the critics... unanimous.</i>

315
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:43,707
They said my ham-fisted attempt
at profundity was devoid of emotion,

316
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,752
lacking in vision, utterly without soul.

317
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:51,632
They not only wanted to destroy me,
they wanted to crush my bones into flour.

318
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:53,217
Why?

319
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:01,975
I had failed to properly seek
their illustrious approval.

320
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:10,609
So, all my new admirers suddenly vanished
and it was over.

321
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:15,614
Which brings us back
to <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

322
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:21,119
Is music in your blood, Joe?

323
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:23,413
I'm sure you've had
your own Eiffel Tower moment.

324
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:26,083
Did you not always just want to be
a piano player?

325
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,669
Please, Mr. Van Meegeren,

326
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:32,339
how did you come by the painting?

327
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:37,094
The same way I came by all of them.

328
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,889
With the help of my friend, Theo.

329
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:45,811
Theo. Theo Wijngaarden,
this mysterious man.

330
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:51,024
Dirk Hannema will know exactly
where he is.

331
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:54,903
- And help me here, who's Dirk Hannema?
- He's a so-called expert.

332
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,364
He's the guiltiest
of all of those critics.

333
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,952
He's also the director
of the Boijmans Museum in Rotterdam,

334
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:04,371
which still to this day confounds me.

335
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:11,128
Well, Dekker, it seems
I'm on my way to Rotterdam.

336
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:19,530
Awe-inspiring, isn't it?

337
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,785
It teaches one the meaning of forgiveness.

338
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:26,161
Mr. Hannema?

339
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:31,792
Until I discovered <i>The Supper at Emmaus,</i>

340
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:35,087
there were just over 30 Vermeers
known to be in existence.

341
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,423
They've become the Holy Grails
of the 20th century.

342
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,052
If there's any silver lining to this war,

343
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:46,306
it's that other hidden masterpieces
may come to light.

344
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:52,563
To discover this one was
the great accomplishment of my life.

345
00:29:53,814 --> 00:29:56,233
What can I do for you, mister...?

346
00:29:58,068 --> 00:29:59,611
Captain Piller.

347
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:04,283
Yes. Your office has been keeping us busy.

348
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:07,452
What brings you here?

349
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:08,787
Theo Wijngaarden.

350
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:19,756
You're Jewish, aren't you?

351
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:24,344
Yes. Is that a problem for you?

352
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:27,473
Tragic what happened to your people.

353
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,185
My people?

354
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,188
Aren't we all Dutch?

355
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:42,070
Theo Wijngaarden. There.

356
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:45,699
Do you know this fellow?

357
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:50,120
A failure as a painter.
Not much of an art dealer either.

358
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:51,580
What was your business with him?

359
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:55,876
He was a competent restorer.
He did a job for me some time ago.

360
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,879
And your opinion of Han Van Meegeren?

361
00:30:58,962 --> 00:31:02,007
Third-rate artist, first-rate opportunist.

362
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,805
Did he associate with the Germans
floating around through the art scene?

363
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:11,767
- It would surprise me if he didn't.
- And why's that?

364
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,103
He's a raging narcissist
and a cunning devil.

365
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:17,981
Enjoy your day, Captain Piller.

366
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:44,049
Satan's piss.

367
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:52,015
Well, that turpentine's all that's left,
thanks to your Nazi friends.

368
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:54,434
You're misinformed. I have no friends.

369
00:31:54,518 --> 00:31:56,103
Yeah, I see why.

370
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,568
This smells drinkable.

371
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:05,028
That's my highest-grade paint stripper.
Why not try it?

372
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:06,488
It'll give you a second asshole.

373
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:09,491
Well, that'd be interesting.

374
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:15,789
I'll tell you what, go to my house.
I have a whiskey collection in the cellar.

375
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:18,750
Bring two cases here
and I will teach you how to drink.

376
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:23,922
If I go to your house, you'll run.

377
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:26,884
My diabolical plan foiled.

378
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:29,720
Except I have no interest in running.

379
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:36,602
Do I look that stupid to you?

380
00:32:37,394 --> 00:32:38,395
Of course not.

381
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:41,940
People like you have done more
for this country than anybody.

382
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:48,614
Damn right.

383
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:52,784
So, what are you painting?

384
00:32:54,828 --> 00:32:57,331
My deliverance. I don't know yet.

385
00:32:57,414 --> 00:33:00,417
My subject is somewhat of a mystery to me.

386
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:56,098
<i>It's quite liberating, you know.</i>

387
00:33:56,723 --> 00:33:59,893
To lay yourself bare and...

388
00:34:01,395 --> 00:34:02,980
have someone paint you,

389
00:34:03,522 --> 00:34:05,190
stroke by stroke.

390
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:10,279
- I see.
- I suppose Theo was in love with me.

391
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:17,161
He said I had a timeless Dutch face
that could grace the classics.

392
00:34:18,162 --> 00:34:23,584
Which was his way
of trying to get me into bed.

393
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:29,089
And did Theo introduce you to Han?

394
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:30,757
Yeah, I think so.

395
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:34,469
Yeah, I think he did.

396
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:37,473
Caroline.

397
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:40,893
The perfect choice for you.

398
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,168
<i>Han loves to paint me.</i>

399
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:12,049
<i>You know, sometimes we don't...
We don't even touch.</i>

400
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:14,967
<i>We don't need to.</i>

401
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:18,722
<i>And tell me, your husband,
he doesn't mind?</i>

402
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,726
<i>Well, Han thinks that, deep down,</i>

403
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:28,232
<i>all men fantasize about their wives
being seduced by another man.</i>

404
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:30,943
Or woman.

405
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:36,490
Han understands the human animal
better than anyone.

406
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:40,369
Is that why the Germans
were so fond of him?

407
00:35:42,246 --> 00:35:45,624
- <i>Everyone... Everyone likes Han.</i>
- The photograph!

408
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:47,876
- <i>He's...</i>
- Five! Come on.

409
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,379
- <i>He's the life of the party.</i>
- Four! Three!

410
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:53,465
- <i>What Germans attended his parties?</i>
- Two! One!

411
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:57,886
I never said they did.

412
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:04,852
Look... I don't know anything
about <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

413
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:06,937
Or any Germans.

414
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:10,774
And I have no idea where Theo is.

415
00:36:15,779 --> 00:36:17,573
Who did Han consort most with?

416
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:24,538
Himself, me and his wife. Ex-wife.

417
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:26,248
Johanna. Where's she?

418
00:36:27,124 --> 00:36:28,667
Somewhere in France.

419
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,045
She got tired of his joie de vivre.

420
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:37,342
But he gave her everything, you know.
The houses, the money.

421
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:42,723
What other man would give his wife
his entire fortune?

422
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,730
What did you find out?

423
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:51,690
Well, depending on who you ask,

424
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,152
he's either Satan or a saint.

425
00:36:56,737 --> 00:37:00,157
Maybe I'll find something
in Theo Wijngaarden's notebooks.

426
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,076
Yes, and check death records, too, please.

427
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,704
Yes, after I've finished the mail,
captain.

428
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:08,123
Thank you.

429
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:14,213
Hello?

430
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:19,176
Dekker?

431
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:21,512
Piller, in here!

432
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:27,142
Walk towards me.

433
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:28,602
Stop!

434
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:32,856
Now, two steps to your right... Left.

435
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:38,237
One more step.
Not that big. Half a step back.

436
00:37:39,488 --> 00:37:40,739
- Here?
- Yeah.

437
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:44,493
- Yeah?
- Now walk slowly towards me.

438
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:46,870
Just do it.

439
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:57,214
You're gonna need this.

440
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:16,692
How much is there?

441
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:18,569
I don't know.

442
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:22,072
It started whispering to me,
so I called you.

443
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:25,742
Having a conscience
is a terrible affliction.

444
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:27,786
Yes, but our reward will come later.

445
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,248
You're damn right it will.
I got two cases of liquor packed.

446
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:32,875
- No, no, no.
- What?

447
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,878
- We're not taking any of that.
- What? We're gonna let it rot?

448
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:38,672
Or leave it for some undeserving asshole?
It's hooch.

449
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:41,800
- It's world-class hooch.
- Yes, and you've had enough.

450
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:42,885
You've had plenty.

451
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:46,930
Just a nip, to make sure
it wasn't an illusion.

452
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:51,059
I've been having a lot of those lately,
and so have you, right?

453
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:53,353
Yes, and booze is not gonna help,
my friend.

454
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,814
Damn well might.

455
00:38:57,274 --> 00:39:00,944
This will bring back a bit
of the old world, help us readjust.

456
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:15,042
Your wife just called.
Should I call her back? What should I say?

457
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:17,961
Tell her I'll be late.
I'll deal with her later.

458
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:26,804
New Year's Eve, two years ago.
That was some night.

459
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:29,348
I bet. Who's who?

460
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:32,226
That's Cootje on my left,

461
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,645
and Johanna, my wife, on my right...
My ex-wife.

462
00:39:35,312 --> 00:39:37,523
Van Stuyvesande you've already met,
the old fop.

463
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:39,483
And these are just friends of friends.

464
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:43,028
What about this one here
next to the blond?

465
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:45,197
The kraut with his arm around her?

466
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,615
Wouldn't have a clue.

467
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,159
Are you sure about that?

468
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:52,287
Look at his face
and that criminal haircut.

469
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:54,164
I wouldn't let that creep shake my hand.

470
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:57,167
Do you remember not shaking his hand?

471
00:39:57,251 --> 00:40:01,338
Oh, Joe, you're so literal.
Have you found Theo yet?

472
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:03,423
I don't want to talk
about phantoms right now.

473
00:40:03,507 --> 00:40:05,968
I want to talk about this Nazi spy

474
00:40:06,051 --> 00:40:08,512
who's toasting to your good health
in this photo.

475
00:40:08,595 --> 00:40:09,721
My parties are lively.

476
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:12,516
People hear about free booze
and free drugs and easy women,

477
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,852
and there were plenty
of those there that night.

478
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,314
Well, he didn't just walk
in your door, did he?

479
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:21,400
- Who brought him?
- I don't know.

480
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,735
Jerome. Maybe it was Jerome.

481
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:26,280
- Jerome Heidjen?
- Yes, but who cares?

482
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:27,823
Look at all these beautiful women

483
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:30,492
and you want to talk about
some pig farmer from Muggendorf.

484
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,371
I think you have more
than a drinking problem.

485
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:38,834
This pig farmer from Muggendorf
was called Hermann Kempf.

486
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:40,878
He was a German intelligence officer,

487
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:44,173
and he used to recruit Dutch citizens
to spy for him.

488
00:40:44,256 --> 00:40:47,885
Hermann Kempf was very costly
to the Dutch Resistance.

489
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:50,095
I am an artist, not a Nazi spy.

490
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:53,015
- Why did you hide the picture?
- I didn't hide it.

491
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,643
- Maybe Johanna did before she left.
- Kempf shows up at your party.

492
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:59,938
Shortly after, you take payment
of 1.6 million guilders

493
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:03,442
from Hermann Göring,
far more than even a Vermeer is worth.

494
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:06,695
And why? Because the Nazis
are so generous?

495
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:08,947
No, because they're narcissistic.

496
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,450
Hitler already had two Vermeers
in his collection.

497
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:14,077
Göring wanted to outdo his Führer.

498
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:17,748
He wanted to own the most valuable
painting in the world, legitimately,

499
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:21,168
- which meant he had to pay for it.
- Or perhaps you were paid

500
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:23,670
for something more
than just the painting.

501
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:24,630
Such as?

502
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:28,634
Money to funnel
to Nazi operatives in Holland,

503
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:30,719
using the art world as a front.

504
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:44,066
Jerome, it's Piller.

505
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:45,818
Just a moment.

506
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:47,027
Let me dress.

507
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:17,850
Good evening, Jerome.

508
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:21,103
Why don't you tell us about
your connection to Van Meegeren?

509
00:42:23,522 --> 00:42:25,315
It's been confirmed by others

510
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:27,693
that you arrived
at his parties with Kempf,

511
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:29,153
that you were friends.

512
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:33,365
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer.

513
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:35,450
That's how I tried to deal with Nazis.

514
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,202
Is that how you dealt with Kempf?

515
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:42,082
You kept him close,
brought him cherries from your garden?

516
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:43,375
I am speaking in general.

517
00:42:45,544 --> 00:42:47,087
Van Meegeren is setting me up.

518
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:50,382
- He's got old scores to settle.
- Like what?

519
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:53,260
Some things I said got back to him.

520
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:56,722
He was a rotten artist, a lecherous drunk.

521
00:42:56,805 --> 00:42:59,641
That's bullshit.
You had this club going, right?

522
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:03,187
You passed information and art
up the chain to Berlin.

523
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,814
They lined your pockets
and let you keep your pretty homes.

524
00:43:05,898 --> 00:43:08,775
- No!
- Did you work with Theo Wijngaarden?

525
00:43:10,277 --> 00:43:11,570
You have their eyes.

526
00:43:12,488 --> 00:43:14,156
So locked in your crusade.

527
00:43:15,657 --> 00:43:17,326
You're not gonna listen to anything.

528
00:43:18,285 --> 00:43:20,537
You just need someone to nail to a cross.

529
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:38,680
Now, that's a very interesting gun,
isn't it?

530
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,060
That's the same gun
the German officers carry.

531
00:43:43,143 --> 00:43:44,645
And all that cash...

532
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:47,314
From your Christmas club, is it?

533
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:53,946
Come clean,
I'll guarantee you a fair trial.

534
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:05,499
A fair trial? As if they won't
rip me apart in the streets.

535
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,044
A Mussert. A traitor!

536
00:44:09,128 --> 00:44:11,755
Tell me the truth.
I promise I'll help you, Jerome.

537
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:25,352
Talk to me!

538
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:42,744
Joe? What's the matter?

539
00:44:56,675 --> 00:44:58,844
You met Han Van Meegeren.

540
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:12,608
- You went to one of his parties.
- I went to a lot of parties, Joe.

541
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:14,485
You know this.

542
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,448
- With Kempf?
- Yes, with Kempf.

543
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:21,575
What is this? What do you want me to say?

544
00:45:21,658 --> 00:45:23,660
I want you to tell me the truth.

545
00:45:23,744 --> 00:45:25,078
The truth?

546
00:45:25,162 --> 00:45:29,791
The truth is that I risked my life
every day to survive, Joe,

547
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,001
and you left.

548
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,836
I did not leave.

549
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:39,259
I joined the Resistance.
Had to go underground.

550
00:45:39,843 --> 00:45:42,012
I'm a Jew, remember?

551
00:45:43,055 --> 00:45:46,016
If I'd stayed,
I would have endangered our family.

552
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:48,435
What did you do?

553
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,853
Went out to parties...

554
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,481
dressed as a whore.

555
00:45:56,735 --> 00:45:58,278
We can't go on like this, Joe.

556
00:46:00,072 --> 00:46:03,784
I need to get out of the city
and go to my father's.

557
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:06,620
That's fine.

558
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:16,213
You've been going for six hours now.

559
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:19,091
Don't you get tired of it?

560
00:46:19,758 --> 00:46:22,386
Inspiration is fleeting.
You do not waste it.

561
00:46:23,178 --> 00:46:25,139
All paint is merely ash and dirt,

562
00:46:25,222 --> 00:46:28,350
but layered together in perfect harmony
and you have a masterpiece

563
00:46:28,976 --> 00:46:33,814
that will survive wars, civilizations,
live longer than mountains.

564
00:46:34,857 --> 00:46:37,985
And that, my friend,
is as close to God as we get.

565
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,946
It's all child's play.

566
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:45,868
Exactly. Children know that secret,
and we grow up and forget.

567
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:51,540
And the only way back is through alcohol
or pain, madness, self-destruction...

568
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,417
Story of my life.

569
00:46:54,877 --> 00:46:58,088
- You miss the war, don't you?
- I miss the action, yeah.

570
00:46:58,172 --> 00:47:00,382
But I do like my country being safe.

571
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,268
Why don't you paint something, my friend?

572
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,613
What do you say?
I will make you a palette.

573
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:27,242
Sure. I'll paint you a masterpiece.

574
00:47:31,246 --> 00:47:32,414
Well, look at that.

575
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:34,750
Yeah.

576
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:36,835
I'm still working on it.

577
00:47:37,836 --> 00:47:40,714
- I know it's a little childish.
- That was my whole point.

578
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:43,550
This has a truth
and therein lies its power.

579
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:20,754
Your dock worker painted that.

580
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:22,631
It's awful.

581
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:25,759
And yet you can't take
your eyes off it, can you?

582
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:29,263
I have absolutely no problem
taking my eyes off it.

583
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:32,641
Why did your wife leave you?

584
00:48:34,768 --> 00:48:36,103
She married an artist.

585
00:48:37,354 --> 00:48:38,981
But then I became a wealthy man.

586
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:41,733
And you were fucking half the town,
weren't you?

587
00:48:42,776 --> 00:48:44,027
Well, yes.

588
00:48:48,657 --> 00:48:50,284
Is your wife leaving you, Joe?

589
00:48:52,202 --> 00:48:53,036
Yes.

590
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:59,168
Or we're leaving each other.

591
00:49:02,296 --> 00:49:03,172
Never easy.

592
00:49:05,215 --> 00:49:08,218
But, truthfully,
marriage is an unnatural state.

593
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,096
It's hard for people
to accept that, of course.

594
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,181
You know what?

595
00:49:14,224 --> 00:49:16,602
I loved being married, but...

596
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:20,355
the war killed us.

597
00:49:21,356 --> 00:49:22,399
The war is over.

598
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:26,153
Well, the Nazis are still
at my house or...

599
00:49:27,571 --> 00:49:29,406
Or their ghosts are, anyway.

600
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:35,245
My wife took a job...

601
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,790
as a secretary for a German officer.

602
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:43,587
It turns out it was Hermann Kempf,
the man whose hand you refused to shake.

603
00:49:44,922 --> 00:49:48,342
It was a way to funnel information
to the Resistance,

604
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:50,385
and she was good.

605
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:55,682
She was very good.
And her effort saved a lot of people.

606
00:49:57,142 --> 00:49:58,560
The Germans trusted her.

607
00:50:01,063 --> 00:50:05,526
But that trust had to be earned.

608
00:50:07,194 --> 00:50:09,905
She had to sleep with this man
to keep in his confidence.

609
00:50:10,823 --> 00:50:12,449
I never asked her about it.

610
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:16,453
I asked her to quit.

611
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:18,747
But only once.

612
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,251
And now?

613
00:50:25,212 --> 00:50:27,422
The past no longer exists to her.

614
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:30,926
She's cut it out like a tumor.

615
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:34,346
I'm sure there are things
you have done in the Resistance

616
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:36,765
that you won't be telling your wife.

617
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:43,021
You should play piano again.
Music, art, it's good for the soul.

618
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,195
Time is growing short, I think.

619
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:57,244
My painting's nearly finished
and then I would like to show it to you.

620
00:51:19,266 --> 00:51:20,434
Would you like a drink?

621
00:51:23,687 --> 00:51:24,688
It's...

622
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:28,192
It's Van Meegeren's private stash.

623
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:31,862
Joe.

624
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:33,655
It's good.

625
00:51:37,951 --> 00:51:39,036
It's empty.

626
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:43,248
Yes, probably is.

627
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:47,544
A walk might be good.

628
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:57,471
- He offered me a job spying for them.
- One of De Klerk's?

629
00:51:58,347 --> 00:52:01,099
He said I should think about my future

630
00:52:01,183 --> 00:52:03,143
because the Allied Command
is on the way out.

631
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:06,897
And what did you say to him?

632
00:52:08,565 --> 00:52:10,359
I said that I would think about it.

633
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:22,788
You should think about your future.

634
00:52:24,248 --> 00:52:25,249
Yes, I know.

635
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:35,092
This is me.

636
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:42,891
What do you do up there? In the dark?

637
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:48,814
I wait for the light.

638
00:52:54,987 --> 00:52:56,405
Were you waiting for me?

639
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:01,743
Yes, I think I was.

640
00:53:43,494 --> 00:53:44,745
Is this your husband?

641
00:53:46,663 --> 00:53:47,498
Yes.

642
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:05,182
When he died, I... didn't cry.

643
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:08,143
Couldn't.

644
00:54:09,686 --> 00:54:11,188
I couldn't feel anything.

645
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:13,273
I was numb.

646
00:54:16,276 --> 00:54:21,156
And then the war was over
and the Allies came, and I just continued.

647
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,951
Just like that.

648
00:54:25,911 --> 00:54:28,413
And I was scared
I might not feel anything anymore.

649
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:34,545
But now I see hope.

650
00:54:35,712 --> 00:54:36,588
For all of us.

651
00:54:38,173 --> 00:54:39,174
I don't know.

652
00:54:40,884 --> 00:54:42,886
Leez and I are like strangers now.

653
00:54:45,013 --> 00:54:45,848
It's...

654
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:53,522
- You're tired.
- Yes, I am.

655
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:56,191
Want to lie down? Rest?

656
00:54:56,817 --> 00:54:58,193
Yeah, I'd like that.

657
00:55:00,112 --> 00:55:01,155
Lie with me?

658
00:55:02,156 --> 00:55:02,990
Yes.

659
00:55:26,013 --> 00:55:27,389
It will be light soon.

660
00:55:28,724 --> 00:55:29,558
Yes.

661
00:55:30,642 --> 00:55:31,727
We'll wait for it.

662
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:43,572
Yes, hello?

663
00:55:53,665 --> 00:55:55,918
Sorry, boss. There's too many of them.

664
00:56:02,216 --> 00:56:05,010
Closed for business. Fuck off.

665
00:56:05,761 --> 00:56:06,762
Let Piller in.

666
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:10,933
And there he is.

667
00:56:15,854 --> 00:56:17,523
You blew it, Piller.

668
00:56:18,732 --> 00:56:22,528
Your bull-in-a-china-shop routine
finally pissed off the big boys

669
00:56:22,611 --> 00:56:26,114
and now this gallery
is Dutch government's property.

670
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:27,825
- Okay, listen, I'm...
- No, no, no.

671
00:56:27,908 --> 00:56:29,993
Whatever you're selling, Piller,
I don't want it.

672
00:56:30,077 --> 00:56:31,745
I'm wrapping this whole thing up.

673
00:56:33,372 --> 00:56:35,582
You're gonna cut Van Meegeren a deal,
aren't you?

674
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:37,459
Yes.

675
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,004
You have a tin ear.
I'm going to cut his throat.

676
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:44,049
Give the people some taste of blood.
Isn't that what you wanted?

677
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:46,969
This guy is an honorary Nazi.
Let him swing with the rest of them.

678
00:56:47,052 --> 00:56:48,929
And I assumed
he had friends in high places.

679
00:56:49,012 --> 00:56:51,723
Yes, he does, and they'd all like
to see his head on a plate.

680
00:56:51,807 --> 00:56:53,350
Enough of this. Where is he?

681
00:56:53,433 --> 00:56:56,186
In the prison, where he belongs.
"Where is he?"

682
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,730
You put him up there
like in some grand hotel.

683
00:56:58,814 --> 00:57:00,274
Did he offer you money?

684
00:57:00,357 --> 00:57:04,945
Actually, how much does it cost
to buy Joe Piller? How much?

685
00:57:05,654 --> 00:57:08,365
Hey! Get off! Get off.

686
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,702
Get him out. Get him out!

687
00:57:15,372 --> 00:57:16,373
My hat, please.

688
00:57:20,419 --> 00:57:21,420
That's sweet.

689
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:27,176
Hey, there's still a job here for you
if you want it, sweetheart.

690
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:29,678
Joe.

691
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,014
Come on.

692
00:57:39,897 --> 00:57:42,816
I had him. I goddamn had him.

693
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,736
And now he's locked in that dungeon
and I can't get to him.

694
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:47,905
We no longer have jurisdiction
over the prison,

695
00:57:47,988 --> 00:57:50,616
and Allied Field Security
has been disbanded.

696
00:57:51,241 --> 00:57:54,369
- Nothing left I can do.
- Not a single favor you can call in?

697
00:57:55,537 --> 00:57:59,458
In your government's eyes,
we're no longer liberators.

698
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:02,503
We're the nuisance keeping Holland
from its future.

699
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,131
Maybe it's time to move on, for all of us.

700
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:12,262
Van Meegeren will pay for what he's done.
Isn't that what you wanted?

701
00:58:13,222 --> 00:58:15,224
Thanks to you, we got another one.

702
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:22,189
Help me.

703
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:24,066
Help me.

704
00:58:24,858 --> 00:58:25,859
Help.

705
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:40,749
Help me!

706
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,292
Traitor!

707
00:58:42,876 --> 00:58:44,128
Traitor!

708
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:51,301
Help me!

709
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:56,974
Help me!

710
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:03,105
Attention!

711
00:59:04,731 --> 00:59:05,566
Aim!

712
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:12,322
Fire!

713
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:07,920
Thank you, Grandpapa.

714
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:12,633
Joseph.

715
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:19,389
- Bye, son.
- Bye, Papa.

716
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:23,060
- Take care of yourself.
- Yes, sir.

717
01:00:23,143 --> 01:00:24,394
Promise me one thing.

718
01:00:25,103 --> 01:00:26,897
- Take care of Mommy.
- Promise.

719
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,315
- Promise?
- Promise.

720
01:00:28,398 --> 01:00:29,399
Get a kiss?

721
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:20,409
The ministry has complained.

722
01:02:15,756 --> 01:02:16,924
- Hello.
- Hello.

723
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,511
I'd give you a hug, but... Yeah.

724
01:02:24,848 --> 01:02:25,682
I...

725
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:28,602
Can we take a walk?

726
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:31,480
Yeah, sure.

727
01:02:35,901 --> 01:02:37,277
Yeah, so here I am.

728
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:41,573
Full tarred and feathered
by the government.

729
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,244
At least it gives you plenty of fresh air.

730
01:02:48,163 --> 01:02:51,166
<i>I know I wasn't allowed,
but I hate unfinished puzzles,</i>

731
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:55,087
so I took all of Theo Wijngaarden's
notebooks home with me

732
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,338
to have a closer look.

733
01:02:57,923 --> 01:03:01,218
And I think I found something.
Can I show it to you?

734
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:02,136
Yes.

735
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:06,765
Do you remember this one?

736
01:03:07,516 --> 01:03:10,519
This is Cootje Henning
drawn by Theo Wijngaarden.

737
01:03:10,602 --> 01:03:11,436
Yes.

738
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,482
Do you know he died
three months ago in Belgium?

739
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:17,526
That hardly matters now, does it?

740
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,698
And now... look at this one.

741
01:03:23,824 --> 01:03:26,160
<i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>
by Johannes Vermeer.

742
01:03:26,243 --> 01:03:27,077
Exactly.

743
01:03:30,164 --> 01:03:31,290
Look at this one.

744
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:36,503
- This one I don't know.
- Also Vermeer. <i>The Smiling Girl.</i>

745
01:03:37,254 --> 01:03:40,382
This one was a known Vermeer
when he was still alive.

746
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:45,053
This one... was found in 1926

747
01:03:45,137 --> 01:03:48,682
and authenticated in 1928 by Dirk Hannema.

748
01:03:48,765 --> 01:03:51,768
Now it's in the National Gallery of Art
in Washington, D.C.

749
01:03:52,436 --> 01:03:54,938
All right. And why am I looking at it?

750
01:03:57,357 --> 01:03:58,358
What do you see?

751
01:03:59,026 --> 01:04:01,153
I see two women.

752
01:04:02,029 --> 01:04:03,405
Look at their faces.

753
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:14,374
Look. They look like sisters.

754
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:17,753
They look almost the same.

755
01:04:18,337 --> 01:04:21,965
So what? So, someone looked
like Cootje Henning 280 years ago.

756
01:04:22,049 --> 01:04:25,719
No. This painting is not 280 years old.

757
01:04:26,261 --> 01:04:27,971
This is Cootje Henning.

758
01:04:31,183 --> 01:04:32,518
So, you're saying it's a fake.

759
01:04:33,435 --> 01:04:34,853
This is Cootje Henning

760
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:38,357
painted to look like a Vermeer
by Theo Wijngaarden.

761
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,984
Theo Wijngaarden was not talented enough.

762
01:04:55,582 --> 01:04:57,251
I know someone who can help.

763
01:05:01,755 --> 01:05:02,589
Minna!

764
01:05:02,673 --> 01:05:05,217
Look, it may not be past your bedtime,

765
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,137
- but it is certainly past mine.
- Can we come in?

766
01:05:09,596 --> 01:05:11,890
One moment, please. My wife.

767
01:05:21,108 --> 01:05:23,652
Sir, are you a registered lawyer?

768
01:05:24,695 --> 01:05:26,572
Minna, who is this man?

769
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:30,784
This is Joseph Piller.
He's... He's a good man.

770
01:05:32,578 --> 01:05:33,787
I see.

771
01:05:33,871 --> 01:05:38,000
I am a registered lawyer, yes,
but I haven't practiced for...

772
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:41,420
- You're hired.
- Hired? My dear fellow...

773
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:43,839
I can offer you a dozen ration tickets.

774
01:05:57,728 --> 01:05:58,729
My credentials.

775
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,773
This is my paralegal, Jacob.

776
01:06:04,818 --> 01:06:08,572
You stink of mothballs.
When did you last wear that?

777
01:06:10,282 --> 01:06:12,743
My wedding. My name is Joseph.

778
01:06:15,412 --> 01:06:17,247
No one is permitted to see him.

779
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:22,336
This facility is now governed
by Dutch law, not military, yes?

780
01:06:23,796 --> 01:06:26,757
Mr. Van Meegeren is entitled
to legal representation,

781
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,841
and I'm his lawyer.

782
01:06:28,592 --> 01:06:31,553
If you refuse me access,
I will take it to a judge

783
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:34,097
and move to have the entire case dropped.

784
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:38,185
Call someone
and tell them exactly that. Now!

785
01:06:39,978 --> 01:06:40,813
Very good.

786
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,984
This painting that you sold to Göring,

787
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:47,736
<i>Christ and the Adulteress,</i>

788
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:50,030
it's not a Vermeer.

789
01:06:52,032 --> 01:06:53,784
It's a fake. You painted it.

790
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:56,954
Finally.

791
01:06:57,955 --> 01:06:59,623
Why didn't you just tell me?

792
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:02,167
You would have believed me?

793
01:07:03,043 --> 01:07:04,378
The experts would have told you

794
01:07:04,461 --> 01:07:06,505
it's impossible
to fake the immortal Vermeer,

795
01:07:06,588 --> 01:07:09,258
and I needed you
to discover the truth for yourself.

796
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:11,927
Always best, don't you think?

797
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,637
And Theo's part in this?

798
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:16,682
Theo taught me a very important part
of the process.

799
01:07:16,765 --> 01:07:18,767
He is my only witness.
Have you found him yet?

800
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:23,522
I am sorry to tell you this,
but Theo is dead.

801
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,735
- How? Do you know?
- I don't know how.

802
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,743
So, there was no spy ring?

803
01:07:38,871 --> 01:07:40,539
I'm sure there was. I don't know.

804
01:07:40,622 --> 01:07:44,877
I am merely a lost artist who found
his calling imitating the masters.

805
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,671
And I stuck those Nazi pigs
for all I could.

806
01:07:49,882 --> 01:07:51,341
But you know the best part for me?

807
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,636
The experts swooning over my creations,

808
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,556
calling them the most exquisite works
ever put to canvas.

809
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:01,101
That made Theo very proud.

810
01:08:03,187 --> 01:08:06,565
How are we gonna prove any of this,
now that Theo is dead?

811
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,542
He kept it safe.

812
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:37,638
<i>We have your painting.</i>

813
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:41,683
- Good.
- And... it looks just like a Vermeer.

814
01:08:42,643 --> 01:08:44,937
A Vermeer that was painted
only two weeks ago.

815
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,731
That's right.
There's more that must be done to it.

816
01:08:47,814 --> 01:08:52,109
Now, this is the process
that Theo and I perfected,

817
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:54,571
which fools the alcohol test
used by the experts,

818
01:08:54,654 --> 01:08:57,073
which means
the painting can be authenticated.

819
01:08:57,157 --> 01:08:58,951
Well, none of this may matter.

820
01:09:00,493 --> 01:09:02,287
- Why?
- Do you think

821
01:09:02,871 --> 01:09:07,334
that the owners of these masterpieces
will deface them on your behalf?

822
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:10,129
We only have to prove
that one of them is a fake, surely.

823
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:13,423
Do you think that the experts
who authenticated these paintings

824
01:09:13,506 --> 01:09:15,466
and whose reputations will be destroyed...?

825
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,886
Can you wait a second, please?

826
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:21,473
Whose reputations will be destroyed,
do you think they will help you?

827
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,768
I'm not asking them to help me.
I'm asking you to help me.

828
01:09:24,852 --> 01:09:27,688
Go to my basement!
Everything you need is there!

829
01:09:35,362 --> 01:09:36,654
Yeah, close it.

830
01:09:39,032 --> 01:09:40,075
All right.

831
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:43,162
Stuyvesande, Wijngaarden.

832
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:44,537
Yes.

833
01:09:46,874 --> 01:09:48,125
<i>Christ and the...</i>

834
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:50,752
- <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>
- Yes.

835
01:09:58,176 --> 01:10:00,720
It's no good. I can't remember.

836
01:10:02,346 --> 01:10:04,099
And when I remember, I can't remember.

837
01:10:04,183 --> 01:10:07,519
I lock up and become a stammering fool.

838
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:12,232
Mr. Bakker, you don't have to remember.
I'll remember. And I'll do the talking.

839
01:10:12,941 --> 01:10:16,403
I just need you to keep me straight
on the legal stuff.

840
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:26,872
It says to be rough with it.

841
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:39,134
Please, find someone else.

842
01:10:39,218 --> 01:10:41,011
You're the only one who I can trust.

843
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,388
You don't have a career to protect.

844
01:10:58,278 --> 01:11:00,739
Why do you care so much about this man?

845
01:11:03,617 --> 01:11:07,079
It's not the man, really.
It's the fact that he's innocent.

846
01:11:10,123 --> 01:11:12,376
How can I let him go to his death?

847
01:11:14,795 --> 01:11:17,047
How could I face my son, knowing that?

848
01:11:18,298 --> 01:11:20,092
You're not going to like this.

849
01:11:21,969 --> 01:11:24,721
They say you've tried to shield
Van Meegeren from the authorities.

850
01:11:25,472 --> 01:11:27,432
De Klerks has put a bull's-eye on you.

851
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:33,355
De Klerks. Sad, little man.

852
01:11:52,082 --> 01:11:53,876
- Traitor!
- Traitor!

853
01:12:03,844 --> 01:12:05,512
Dekker, stop. Stop. Stop!

854
01:13:15,999 --> 01:13:17,835
Henricus Antonius Van Meegeren.

855
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,133
You are charged with collaborating
with the enemy during a time of war.

856
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:25,217
How do you plead?

857
01:13:25,926 --> 01:13:27,511
Not guilty, Your Honor.

858
01:13:28,428 --> 01:13:29,263
Very well.

859
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:31,306
Proceed.

860
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:35,561
May it please the court, I am
Special Prosecutor Maarten Wooning.

861
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:39,606
The government will prove to the court
that Mr. Van Meegeren is guilty

862
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:44,194
of selling Dutch cultural treasures
to Hitler's Reich,

863
01:13:44,278 --> 01:13:46,613
for the purpose of enriching himself

864
01:13:46,697 --> 01:13:49,741
and giving aid
to the occupational government.

865
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:53,537
A capital offense for which he deserves
the harshest punishment.

866
01:13:54,413 --> 01:13:55,497
Thank you.

867
01:14:00,794 --> 01:14:01,837
I'm Captain Jo...

868
01:14:03,297 --> 01:14:04,965
I'm Captain Joseph Piller.

869
01:14:05,716 --> 01:14:07,217
May it please the court.

870
01:14:08,635 --> 01:14:12,139
May it please the court.
I am former Captain Joseph Piller.

871
01:14:12,222 --> 01:14:14,266
Are you a lawyer, Mr. Piller?

872
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:18,061
No, sir. Mr. Bakker here next to me
is a lawyer.

873
01:14:18,812 --> 01:14:22,191
But I have spent more time than anyone
investigating Mr. Van Meegeren,

874
01:14:22,274 --> 01:14:25,402
and I've come to the conclusion
that he is innocent of these charges.

875
01:14:25,944 --> 01:14:29,823
Hence, I was asked by the defendant
to speak on his behalf.

876
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:33,035
- Very well.
- We will prove

877
01:14:33,785 --> 01:14:36,455
that Mr. Van Meegeren
is not a collaborator

878
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,998
but indeed a patriot,

879
01:14:38,081 --> 01:14:42,336
who swindled the Nazi regime
out of a fortune from their war chest

880
01:14:42,419 --> 01:14:45,422
by selling them a fake masterpiece.

881
01:14:45,506 --> 01:14:47,174
How much did he pay you, Piller?

882
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:51,303
Quiet.

883
01:14:54,014 --> 01:14:55,015
Mr. Wooning.

884
01:14:56,975 --> 01:14:59,436
Mr. Henricus Van Meegeren.

885
01:14:59,978 --> 01:15:02,564
We might save time
if you just call me Han.

886
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,236
Very well. Do you recognize this receipt?

887
01:15:08,946 --> 01:15:10,781
I would hope so. Those are my initials.

888
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:13,951
Please tell the court what it was for.

889
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:18,288
It is the bill of sale
for <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

890
01:15:18,372 --> 01:15:22,459
That you sold to the second-highest
ranking Nazi in the Reich

891
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:27,172
for the staggering sum
of 1.6 million guilders.

892
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,758
Indeed. It is a unique painting.

893
01:15:29,842 --> 01:15:34,221
I'd say. That's the most on record
ever paid for a work of art.

894
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:38,058
If I'd offered a discount,
he would have suspected it was a fake.

895
01:15:43,397 --> 01:15:48,110
Johannes Vermeer was one
of the greatest artists in history.

896
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:51,655
And you're asking this court
to believe that you,

897
01:15:52,322 --> 01:15:55,576
a man who could hardly sell
a single picture with your own name on it,

898
01:15:56,368 --> 01:15:59,705
somehow painted better
than the Master of Delft

899
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:03,041
and outsmarted the world's
most esteemed Vermeer experts?

900
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:04,418
Well-stated, sir.

901
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,796
All you've left me to say is yes.

902
01:16:12,926 --> 01:16:15,512
I call Dirk Hannema to the floor.

903
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:24,021
Mr. Hannema,
state your credentials for us.

904
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:27,900
I have been the director
of the Boijmans Museum for eight years.

905
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:32,237
Before that, I was an art dealer
for six of the top galleries in Holland

906
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,990
and also the chief critic
for the <i>Nederlander.</i>

907
01:16:35,741 --> 01:16:38,744
How many paintings have you verified
in your career?

908
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:39,703
Hundreds.

909
01:16:39,786 --> 01:16:42,080
- Come across any fakes?
- Scores.

910
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,832
They're quite easy to spot.

911
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:47,419
In rare cases, the technique is adequate,

912
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:50,631
but none pass the chemical test used
to verify their age.

913
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:56,303
You were one of the experts
who verified <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

914
01:16:56,386 --> 01:16:58,597
Indeed, very thoroughly.

915
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,558
- Could it possibly be a fake?
- Absolutely not.

916
01:17:02,309 --> 01:17:03,727
But that's just your opinion.

917
01:17:03,811 --> 01:17:06,939
I consulted
with half a dozen published experts

918
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:09,066
who have spent two months
with the painting,

919
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,193
cleaning and restoring it,

920
01:17:11,276 --> 01:17:14,530
- and came to the same conclusion I did.
- Which is?

921
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:19,284
Johannes Vermeer painted
<i>Christ and the Adulteress</i> around 1660.

922
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:22,830
Do you know the defendant?

923
01:17:22,913 --> 01:17:26,166
Mr. Van Meegeren and I have crossed paths
in the art world.

924
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,545
And is there any way
he could have created a Vermeer?

925
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,632
There is no way.

926
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:39,638
This was painted by the defendant
around the time <i>Adulteress</i> sold.

927
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,768
Mr. Van Meegeren's art
has always been imbued

928
01:17:44,852 --> 01:17:48,313
with a base, almost pornographic nature.

929
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:53,152
It's fantasy to believe these two works
were painted by the same man.

930
01:17:54,153 --> 01:17:54,987
Thank you.

931
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,865
Mr. Piller?

932
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:03,996
Some ten years ago,
you discovered another lost Vermeer.

933
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:05,747
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

934
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:07,332
<i>The Supper at Emmaus.</i>

935
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:11,295
That made you...
a bit of a celebrity, right?

936
01:18:11,378 --> 01:18:13,005
Well, I suppose.

937
01:18:13,714 --> 01:18:16,550
It's now considered
Vermeer's greatest triumph.

938
01:18:17,176 --> 01:18:19,595
Mr. Hannema,
help me understand something.

939
01:18:20,596 --> 01:18:24,600
Vermeer painted just over 30 works
in the 1600s,

940
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:29,938
with no new works being discovered
for the next 250 years.

941
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:34,985
Then, suddenly, six new works
are found in as many years

942
01:18:35,068 --> 01:18:37,863
and all of them traceable
back to one person...

943
01:18:39,364 --> 01:18:40,574
Mr. Van Meegeren.

944
01:18:40,657 --> 01:18:42,159
What it tells me

945
01:18:42,242 --> 01:18:45,787
is that Van Meegeren got the paintings
from a single source,

946
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,373
a family, perhaps,

947
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:51,376
desperate to flee Europe
before the war began.

948
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:53,921
Perhaps Jews.

949
01:18:57,549 --> 01:19:03,347
And has any member of this mystery family
come forward, Mr. Hannema?

950
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:08,268
Provenances are sometimes difficult
to authenticate during wartime.

951
01:19:09,394 --> 01:19:11,271
So, the answer to that question is no.

952
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:20,113
How do you determine
if a painting is real or fake?

953
01:19:20,197 --> 01:19:23,534
A deep intuition
that cannot be put into words,

954
01:19:24,117 --> 01:19:27,579
followed by scrupulous analysis
of the painter's technique,

955
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:29,748
composition and color palette.

956
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:32,251
And should it pass this rigorous process,

957
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:35,254
the final arbiter
is the application of alcohol

958
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:37,047
to a tiny portion of the canvas.

959
01:19:37,714 --> 01:19:40,342
Oil paints dry and harden over time,

960
01:19:40,425 --> 01:19:43,137
and by that, I mean decades,
even a century.

961
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:48,016
If the paint dissolves, it's a fake.
Let me demonstrate for you.

962
01:19:57,776 --> 01:19:59,862
It's completely safe, I assure you.

963
01:20:08,328 --> 01:20:10,455
No paint, no forgery.

964
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,500
And this technique is foolproof?

965
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:18,255
When it comes to oil paint,
you simply can't cheat time.

966
01:20:20,507 --> 01:20:22,551
Thank you, Mr. Hannema.

967
01:20:23,844 --> 01:20:27,681
Ladies and gentlemen,
<i>The Supper at Emmaus.</i>

968
01:20:36,148 --> 01:20:37,608
It became my passion

969
01:20:37,691 --> 01:20:41,487
after critics like Dirk Hannema
destroyed my career years earlier.

970
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:46,533
So, you painted all these
as sort of revenge?

971
01:20:47,034 --> 01:20:49,244
And others which are not here today.

972
01:20:49,328 --> 01:20:52,039
They are hanging in the Rijksmuseum,
the Boijmans,

973
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:54,291
even in the National Gallery of Art

974
01:20:54,374 --> 01:20:56,710
in the capital
of the United States of America.

975
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,421
And I painted them not as revenge

976
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:02,966
but to bring more beauty
into the world, more Vermeer.

977
01:21:03,801 --> 01:21:04,968
There is simply not enough.

978
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:12,601
And tell us how you might pass
the alcohol test Mr. Hannema described.

979
01:21:13,143 --> 01:21:15,938
Same way I pass every alcohol test,
with flying colors.

980
01:21:17,397 --> 01:21:20,275
Mr. Van Meegeren, answer the question.

981
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:25,447
I use a very common plastic resin
called Bakelite.

982
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:28,784
Invented in 1908,
it was the first plastic.

983
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:31,495
And when it's heated,
it perfectly emulates

984
01:21:31,578 --> 01:21:34,748
the hardness and consistency
of centuries-old paint,

985
01:21:34,832 --> 01:21:38,669
so Mr. Hannema can douse it in alcohol
all day if he so chooses

986
01:21:38,752 --> 01:21:40,796
and he won't succeed
in removing any of it.

987
01:21:40,879 --> 01:21:43,465
And what challenges does one face?

988
01:21:44,174 --> 01:21:46,969
Because the Bakelite is mixed
into the pigment,

989
01:21:47,052 --> 01:21:49,304
<i>it makes it very difficult
to compose with.</i>

990
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:53,392
- And then?
- I must also find canvas and frame

991
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:56,436
from the correct period.
They are impossible to duplicate.

992
01:21:57,187 --> 01:21:58,605
<i>Once the canvas is stripped,</i>

993
01:21:58,689 --> 01:22:02,192
<i>I then must create
an unmistakably original work.</i>

994
01:22:02,276 --> 01:22:05,487
I have studied every one
of Vermeer's brushstrokes.

995
01:22:05,571 --> 01:22:08,907
I understand perfectly
the pressure he applied,

996
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:10,367
<i>the movement of his wrist,</i>

997
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:13,579
<i>even the hairs that he's chosen
for each brush.</i>

998
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:16,290
<i>I also understand
how he mixes his pigments</i>

999
01:22:16,373 --> 01:22:18,167
as well as how he interprets light.

1000
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:20,711
So, you tried to emulate a genius?

1001
01:22:20,794 --> 01:22:25,090
Yes, but more than that, I must also weave
the present into the past

1002
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:28,469
to make the viewer my coconspirator,

1003
01:22:28,552 --> 01:22:31,555
so it not only fools the mind,
it tugs at the heart.

1004
01:22:32,055 --> 01:22:35,225
Look at my lacemaker.
Is she from Vermeer's time?

1005
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:40,814
No. She is a jazz-age flapper.
And she arouses you, yes?

1006
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,568
And if you look closely
at this young lady here,

1007
01:22:44,651 --> 01:22:46,778
you may recognize the face of Greta Garbo.

1008
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:48,322
Göring was no different.

1009
01:22:48,822 --> 01:22:52,493
At the Olympics in '36,
I learned of the kind of art he liked,

1010
01:22:52,576 --> 01:22:57,498
so when I painted <i>Adulteress,</i>
I gave him his very own Nazi Jesus.

1011
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:03,212
He believed he was gazing
at a 300-year-old painting,

1012
01:23:03,295 --> 01:23:07,633
but as Narcissus, he would see
his own eternity in that canvas,

1013
01:23:08,175 --> 01:23:10,010
his thousand-year Reich.

1014
01:23:11,929 --> 01:23:14,223
Never once occurred to him
the painting was a fake.

1015
01:23:14,848 --> 01:23:18,185
And, Mr. Van Meegeren,
your views on fascism?

1016
01:23:19,311 --> 01:23:20,687
I despise it intensely.

1017
01:23:21,522 --> 01:23:23,649
I believe every fascist deserves
to be swindled.

1018
01:23:25,818 --> 01:23:26,819
Thank you.

1019
01:23:34,326 --> 01:23:37,287
All these exploits...

1020
01:23:40,165 --> 01:23:42,668
Yet there isn't a soul
to corroborate any of it.

1021
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:45,170
All we have is your fantastic story...

1022
01:23:45,963 --> 01:23:48,715
against the experts' facts.

1023
01:23:48,799 --> 01:23:51,510
And you declare yourself
a hater of fascists,

1024
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:53,887
yet you were a registered member

1025
01:23:53,971 --> 01:23:57,266
of the fascist-leaning Unity Party
before the war.

1026
01:23:57,975 --> 01:24:01,395
- That was simply a matter of...
- In fact, the chairman of the party

1027
01:24:01,478 --> 01:24:05,649
described you as,
"One of our best contemporary artists,

1028
01:24:05,732 --> 01:24:08,318
motivated more by passion
for our principles

1029
01:24:08,402 --> 01:24:11,655
than by desire for material gains."

1030
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:15,117
They weren't Nazis. They were
the wealthy and elite of society.

1031
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:19,454
Closet fascists who saluted the Nazis
when they took over.

1032
01:24:19,538 --> 01:24:22,499
They could afford to have flattering
portraits of themselves painted,

1033
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,668
and as a young artist,
that was survival for me.

1034
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:26,587
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

1035
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:30,132
Nothing. I would have told you this
if I'd remembered such nonsense.

1036
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:32,009
You had the courtroom!

1037
01:24:33,886 --> 01:24:35,429
You got under their skin.

1038
01:24:35,512 --> 01:24:38,640
And now Wooning has taken away
all your credibility.

1039
01:24:39,683 --> 01:24:41,310
And there's something else.

1040
01:24:41,393 --> 01:24:44,188
Wooning has found your ex-wife in France.

1041
01:24:45,063 --> 01:24:46,690
He's going to put her on the stand.

1042
01:24:51,695 --> 01:24:52,529
Well, this...

1043
01:24:53,739 --> 01:24:54,823
This is good news.

1044
01:24:56,241 --> 01:24:57,910
That is good news indeed.

1045
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:09,129
Your ex-husband gave you
most of the assets in the divorce.

1046
01:25:09,963 --> 01:25:12,341
- He did.
- And what were those?

1047
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:14,218
Couldn't tell you.

1048
01:25:17,095 --> 01:25:18,806
Fourteen houses,

1049
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:22,142
seven plots of land in Laren,

1050
01:25:22,226 --> 01:25:24,186
two homes in Deventer,

1051
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:26,355
a chateau in Monaco,

1052
01:25:27,397 --> 01:25:33,153
and 567 individual properties
in Amsterdam,

1053
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:36,907
as well as the millions of guilders
stowed in the floorboards of your home.

1054
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:38,242
Does that sound correct?

1055
01:25:39,076 --> 01:25:40,077
I suppose so.

1056
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,913
For the record, Your Honor,
most of Van Meegeren's real estate

1057
01:25:42,996 --> 01:25:45,082
was bought during the German occupation,

1058
01:25:45,165 --> 01:25:48,544
after the sale
of <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

1059
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:53,966
Now, did your former husband ever intimate

1060
01:25:54,049 --> 01:25:57,553
that the pictures he sold
by Vermeer, Hals, de Hooch,

1061
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:00,639
were actually painted by his own hand?

1062
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:01,557
No.

1063
01:26:02,474 --> 01:26:05,519
Though, if anyone could do it,
it would be him.

1064
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:09,398
He is relentless
once he has an idea in his mind.

1065
01:26:10,315 --> 01:26:14,236
His artistic talents, I believe,
are second to none.

1066
01:26:14,778 --> 01:26:15,821
He is a genius.

1067
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:19,032
Do you recognize this photograph?

1068
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:23,662
It's from a party we hosted
shortly before our divorce.

1069
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:30,169
Germans attended your parties often.

1070
01:26:33,046 --> 01:26:34,798
Rarely but it did happen.

1071
01:26:34,882 --> 01:26:36,425
- Thank you.
- They were everywhere.

1072
01:26:54,693 --> 01:26:58,155
<i>Were you married to him
when he joined the National Unity Party?</i>

1073
01:26:58,238 --> 01:26:59,281
Yes, we were.

1074
01:26:59,907 --> 01:27:01,950
Please tell us why he joined.

1075
01:27:03,076 --> 01:27:04,453
It was a long time ago.

1076
01:27:05,204 --> 01:27:08,916
Painting portraits was one of the few ways
an artist could make a living.

1077
01:27:09,666 --> 01:27:13,045
And was your husband a believer
in the party's doctrine?

1078
01:27:13,128 --> 01:27:18,675
My ex-husband is apolitical,
agnostic, apathetic.

1079
01:27:19,551 --> 01:27:22,763
I can think of a few other adjectives...

1080
01:27:23,722 --> 01:27:26,517
- but here is not the place for them.
- Thank you.

1081
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:32,189
<i>You are Van Meegeren's assistant?</i>

1082
01:27:32,272 --> 01:27:33,232
I am.

1083
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:35,192
And also his mistress.

1084
01:27:36,443 --> 01:27:41,323
We're... friendly,
both professionally and personally.

1085
01:27:41,406 --> 01:27:43,742
- You were a confidante for years.
- Yes.

1086
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:49,498
Would you describe Mr. Van Meegeren
as a bit of a showman,

1087
01:27:49,581 --> 01:27:52,209
someone that wanted
to be seen, recognized?

1088
01:27:53,127 --> 01:27:54,294
What artist isn't?

1089
01:27:56,255 --> 01:27:59,174
Did you ever witness Han forge
a Vermeer painting?

1090
01:28:00,259 --> 01:28:01,093
Yes, I did.

1091
01:28:02,302 --> 01:28:03,137
Many times.

1092
01:28:04,304 --> 01:28:07,266
Did you know that he then sold them
for exorbitant sums?

1093
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:10,394
- Of course.
- That would make you an accomplice.

1094
01:28:11,645 --> 01:28:12,729
I understand.

1095
01:28:15,107 --> 01:28:17,776
What about this one?
Did you see him paint it?

1096
01:28:18,485 --> 01:28:21,864
- I did.
- In 1939, at his studio in Amsterdam.

1097
01:28:21,947 --> 01:28:22,781
Yes.

1098
01:28:23,949 --> 01:28:29,705
Han Van Meegeren spent all of 1939
at his villa in France.

1099
01:28:29,788 --> 01:28:32,708
- If I didn't see that one...
- No further questions.

1100
01:28:35,252 --> 01:28:36,295
Mr. Piller?

1101
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:40,215
Questions for Mrs. Henning?

1102
01:28:43,135 --> 01:28:44,219
No.

1103
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,723
We will adjourn until tomorrow.

1104
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:07,534
Proceed, Mr. Piller.

1105
01:29:08,494 --> 01:29:12,289
Your Honor,
we have one final piece of evidence.

1106
01:29:13,665 --> 01:29:15,417
Very well but get on with it.

1107
01:29:28,722 --> 01:29:31,850
We call Dirk Hannema to the stand.

1108
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:45,030
Mr. Hannema,
do you recognize this painting?

1109
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:49,201
Yes, it was brought to me recently
for analysis

1110
01:29:49,993 --> 01:29:52,579
by the office of the Allied Command.

1111
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:54,289
And what was your opinion of it?

1112
01:29:55,290 --> 01:30:00,420
Well, I subjected it
to the usual tests and scrutiny...

1113
01:30:00,504 --> 01:30:02,631
I have your written statement here.

1114
01:30:04,091 --> 01:30:08,887
"The painting tentatively titled
<i>Boy Jesus in the Temple</i>

1115
01:30:09,471 --> 01:30:14,101
is likely an early work
in Vermeer's lost biblical series.

1116
01:30:15,102 --> 01:30:20,524
The work is estimated to be 280 years old

1117
01:30:21,275 --> 01:30:23,527
and is a major and important find."

1118
01:30:25,028 --> 01:30:27,865
- You wrote that?
- Indeed. And I stand by it.

1119
01:30:27,948 --> 01:30:31,326
You didn't spend very long
analyzing it, did you?

1120
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:34,163
It was clearly part
of the biblical series.

1121
01:30:34,246 --> 01:30:36,165
I was able to expedite the process...

1122
01:30:36,248 --> 01:30:37,749
It should be noted, Your Honor,

1123
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:41,920
that Mr. Hannema has already
put in a bid for this painting,

1124
01:30:42,004 --> 01:30:44,840
hoping to acquire it
for the Boijmans Gallery.

1125
01:30:44,923 --> 01:30:46,049
And why is that relevant?

1126
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:51,054
Your Honor, this painting
is not even 1 year old.

1127
01:30:52,055 --> 01:30:55,184
It was painted by Han Van Meegeren
while in my custody

1128
01:30:55,267 --> 01:30:57,102
at the Goudstikker Gallery.

1129
01:30:57,186 --> 01:30:58,854
That's utter nonsense.

1130
01:30:58,937 --> 01:31:02,691
My associates and I were there
for the entire creation,

1131
01:31:02,774 --> 01:31:07,237
start till finish,
not knowing its purpose at the time.

1132
01:31:07,321 --> 01:31:11,325
Mr. Van Meegeren painted this painting
to try and save his life.

1133
01:31:11,408 --> 01:31:15,996
Are you saying that you then submitted it
to Mr. Hannema for verification?

1134
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:21,210
No, my assistant, Minna Holmberg, did,
through the Allied Command.

1135
01:31:21,293 --> 01:31:24,213
But not until the process
had been completed in full.

1136
01:31:24,296 --> 01:31:25,380
What does that mean?

1137
01:31:25,464 --> 01:31:28,425
That means that Mr. Van Meegeren
painted the painting,

1138
01:31:28,509 --> 01:31:32,805
and Mr. Dekker and I assisted him
in aging it.

1139
01:31:33,514 --> 01:31:35,224
The process is quite intricate,

1140
01:31:35,307 --> 01:31:38,602
but, as you can see,
it is very convincing.

1141
01:31:38,685 --> 01:31:40,771
Another fantastic story!

1142
01:31:40,854 --> 01:31:43,774
Your Honor, if I may,
I would ask the court to observe

1143
01:31:43,857 --> 01:31:47,694
the second figure on the left
is in fact Captain Joseph Piller,

1144
01:31:47,778 --> 01:31:51,782
my jailer, whom I painted
in the style of Vermeer.

1145
01:31:54,827 --> 01:31:55,994
Quiet!

1146
01:31:56,078 --> 01:31:58,539
There is some likeness
between Mr. Piller and the subject,

1147
01:31:58,622 --> 01:31:59,581
but is that proof?

1148
01:31:59,665 --> 01:32:01,458
It could be purely coincidental.

1149
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:04,253
- You need your eyes tested.
- Mr. Van Meegeren!

1150
01:32:04,336 --> 01:32:06,338
You might find in this courtroom
several men,

1151
01:32:06,421 --> 01:32:08,882
who, with some cloth on their head,
resemble this disciple.

1152
01:32:08,966 --> 01:32:11,969
Your Honor, there is enough here

1153
01:32:12,052 --> 01:32:16,098
to warrant a more radical
and foolproof test.

1154
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:19,434
Please, take a tiny scraping
of this painting

1155
01:32:19,518 --> 01:32:23,605
and test it for the presence
of phenol formaldehyde or Bakelite,

1156
01:32:24,273 --> 01:32:26,775
a compound invented
less than 40 years ago.

1157
01:32:26,859 --> 01:32:28,193
We don't need...

1158
01:32:30,654 --> 01:32:31,989
In my chambers.

1159
01:32:32,072 --> 01:32:34,116
Even if Van Meegeren
did paint that thing,

1160
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:38,245
it doesn't mean that Göring's Vermeer,
for which he stands trial, is a fake.

1161
01:32:38,328 --> 01:32:41,123
Test both paintings. Test all of them.

1162
01:32:41,206 --> 01:32:45,335
These are priceless cultural treasures,
and to deface them is totally...

1163
01:32:45,419 --> 01:32:48,297
Your Honor,
you're talking about paintings.

1164
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:51,550
I'm talking about a man's life.

1165
01:32:52,342 --> 01:32:55,804
I... am not persuaded.

1166
01:32:55,888 --> 01:32:58,432
This isn't a trial. This is a stage play.

1167
01:32:58,515 --> 01:33:01,226
Someone who just wants
Van Meegeren out of the way.

1168
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,562
Someone whose wife he slept with.

1169
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,273
Someone who didn't get
a good cut of bacon.

1170
01:33:06,356 --> 01:33:08,692
- Oh, please.
- Let me tell you this.

1171
01:33:12,279 --> 01:33:16,867
They're persuaded,
and when they hear the full truth,

1172
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:19,953
after you've thrown Van Meegeren
to the wolves,

1173
01:33:20,037 --> 01:33:22,206
they will be coming for you next.

1174
01:33:23,207 --> 01:33:25,042
Are you threatening me?

1175
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:27,795
Yes, you're goddamn right I am.

1176
01:33:29,254 --> 01:33:32,174
You jumped-up spiv.

1177
01:33:34,134 --> 01:33:37,221
Now, consider this a first...

1178
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:40,307
and final warning.

1179
01:33:47,815 --> 01:33:49,525
You've been played, Piller.

1180
01:33:50,359 --> 01:33:53,862
Van Meegeren is the magician
and you're his greatest trick.

1181
01:33:53,946 --> 01:33:55,989
Maybe this case is all about you.

1182
01:33:56,573 --> 01:33:58,534
Did you get a taste for the good life?

1183
01:33:59,117 --> 01:34:01,411
You think he's gonna give you
a pile of cash

1184
01:34:01,495 --> 01:34:03,622
to secure your family's future?

1185
01:34:03,705 --> 01:34:05,749
Good luck with the verdict!

1186
01:34:07,042 --> 01:34:09,503
That deliberation is not gonna
take very long, is it?

1187
01:34:10,587 --> 01:34:12,381
I think we'd stand a chance.

1188
01:34:14,133 --> 01:34:15,801
They believed that painting.

1189
01:34:17,386 --> 01:34:19,096
Look at all these people.

1190
01:34:22,141 --> 01:34:23,183
They need a win.

1191
01:35:06,852 --> 01:35:10,939
Upon careful consideration
of all the facts presented,

1192
01:35:12,524 --> 01:35:15,402
it is the unanimous conclusion
of this court...

1193
01:35:16,653 --> 01:35:18,489
that Han Van Meegeren...

1194
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:23,619
is guilty of wartime collaboration
with the enemy.

1195
01:35:25,245 --> 01:35:27,414
And I hereby sentence to...

1196
01:35:29,625 --> 01:35:30,793
Quiet!

1197
01:35:30,876 --> 01:35:34,004
And I hereby sentence him to death.

1198
01:35:35,088 --> 01:35:36,089
Quiet!

1199
01:35:40,636 --> 01:35:41,762
He doesn't deserve that!

1200
01:35:43,764 --> 01:35:45,849
Order! Silence!

1201
01:35:49,269 --> 01:35:50,479
Come on!

1202
01:36:02,616 --> 01:36:03,659
Piller!

1203
01:36:04,993 --> 01:36:06,078
What is he doing?

1204
01:36:10,374 --> 01:36:12,126
Stop him! Stop him!

1205
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:20,926
"H.V.M."

1206
01:36:21,885 --> 01:36:26,723
Han Van Meegeren.
This painting... is a fake.

1207
01:36:26,807 --> 01:36:28,559
They're all fakes.

1208
01:36:32,396 --> 01:36:33,647
Only one minute ago,

1209
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:36,859
these paintings were considered
sublime and priceless.

1210
01:36:37,317 --> 01:36:40,821
Now they are worthless
and not one brushstroke has changed.

1211
01:36:47,286 --> 01:36:48,287
Quiet!

1212
01:38:03,487 --> 01:38:05,906
You kids don't know how to drink anymore.

1213
01:38:06,698 --> 01:38:07,699
Another round.

1214
01:38:09,493 --> 01:38:10,828
Who are you calling a kid?

1215
01:38:13,288 --> 01:38:14,122
Thank you.

1216
01:40:12,115 --> 01:40:13,116
Surprise.

1217
01:40:15,702 --> 01:40:17,913
May I come in, just for one minute?

1218
01:40:22,835 --> 01:40:23,836
Thank you.

1219
01:40:30,843 --> 01:40:32,636
Congratulations are in order.

1220
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:35,347
Please don't tell me you're here
to give me the Medal of Merit.

1221
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:38,392
No, no, no.
I'm here, actually, to give you this.

1222
01:40:39,852 --> 01:40:41,145
A souvenir.

1223
01:40:41,228 --> 01:40:44,398
My assistant came across it
when we were packing up the gallery.

1224
01:40:44,481 --> 01:40:46,859
It's a collection of Van Meegeren's art.

1225
01:40:48,777 --> 01:40:52,781
Yes, I know it. The Americans found it
in Hitler's private library.

1226
01:40:53,615 --> 01:40:55,576
The dedication page might interest you.

1227
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:13,469
The people have their hero.

1228
01:41:17,347 --> 01:41:19,892
I'm done with this case,
but what about you?

1229
01:41:31,695 --> 01:41:34,698
We are so pleased you came, Joe.

1230
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:39,244
Joseph, look at this.
Look at the light on their faces.

1231
01:41:39,995 --> 01:41:42,372
Our story is all over the world.

1232
01:41:42,456 --> 01:41:45,876
We have given Holland wings to rise
from the ashes.

1233
01:41:46,752 --> 01:41:48,712
A victory over darkness.

1234
01:41:50,255 --> 01:41:51,840
People want more life again.

1235
01:41:52,758 --> 01:41:56,178
They want to laugh,
to drink, to have hope.

1236
01:41:56,261 --> 01:41:58,347
They want to dream of a better day.

1237
01:41:58,430 --> 01:42:01,183
And thanks to you, they can and they will.

1238
01:42:02,351 --> 01:42:06,021
You got what you wanted.
You enabled them to see the truth.

1239
01:42:06,104 --> 01:42:08,357
And here it is,
in beautiful black and white.

1240
01:42:10,692 --> 01:42:12,611
You're quite the hero, it seems.

1241
01:42:13,195 --> 01:42:16,323
I suppose this is more adulation
than even you imagined.

1242
01:42:16,406 --> 01:42:19,827
Are you kidding me?
I always imagined it. Please sit down.

1243
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:28,168
Listen... Joseph.

1244
01:42:29,086 --> 01:42:32,965
I never could have trusted anyone
in the way I trusted you.

1245
01:42:34,174 --> 01:42:35,509
I hope you understand that.

1246
01:42:36,802 --> 01:42:40,472
{\an8}Perhaps, then,
you can help me understand this.

1247
01:42:47,771 --> 01:42:49,940
{\an8}"To my beloved Führer,

1248
01:42:51,024 --> 01:42:52,985
in grateful tribute.

1249
01:42:53,068 --> 01:42:54,987
Han Van Meegeren."

1250
01:42:55,612 --> 01:42:58,532
Very touching gift to Adolf Hitler

1251
01:42:59,241 --> 01:43:02,703
from Holland's most famous hater
of the Nazis.

1252
01:43:09,334 --> 01:43:13,464
In the colonies of yesteryear,
we were the Nazis, yeah?

1253
01:43:13,547 --> 01:43:16,675
We raped, we murdered, we took slaves.

1254
01:43:16,758 --> 01:43:19,094
We even threw babies onto fires.

1255
01:43:19,928 --> 01:43:23,765
And the statues of the men
who led to those glorious exploits

1256
01:43:23,849 --> 01:43:25,934
stand proudly in our public spaces.

1257
01:43:26,768 --> 01:43:31,190
The tide comes in, the tide goes out.
And we do what we can to survive.

1258
01:43:32,941 --> 01:43:34,359
To keep the hope alive.

1259
01:43:35,277 --> 01:43:37,279
In all our glorious colors,

1260
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:39,698
including gray.

1261
01:43:41,992 --> 01:43:44,620
Bravo. To art.

1262
01:43:50,834 --> 01:43:53,170
I never really cared about art.

1263
01:43:53,253 --> 01:43:56,590
But now I know
that all truly great artists

1264
01:43:56,673 --> 01:44:01,470
bravely walk through the fire of critics
and doubting sheep

1265
01:44:02,012 --> 01:44:03,931
to claim their place in history.

1266
01:44:04,598 --> 01:44:06,642
And that is black and white.

1267
01:44:06,725 --> 01:44:09,812
And that is why the merchants place
such high value on art.

1268
01:44:10,562 --> 01:44:15,943
They get to possess their own small piece
of an incorruptible soul.

1269
01:44:17,945 --> 01:44:21,198
But you could have claimed
your place in history as an artist.

1270
01:44:22,991 --> 01:44:27,329
Your own name and right next
to Hals, Rembrandt, Vermeer even.

1271
01:44:28,121 --> 01:44:31,792
God gave you all the talent in the world.

1272
01:44:33,961 --> 01:44:36,088
Yet you went and wasted it all away.

1273
01:44:37,464 --> 01:44:40,175
Guess you weren't brave enough
to walk through the fire.

1274
01:44:53,230 --> 01:44:54,314
Joseph, please.

1275
01:44:55,691 --> 01:44:58,068
I did trust you, I did.

1276
01:44:59,778 --> 01:45:01,572
That's why I stood up for you.

1277
01:45:03,407 --> 01:45:05,409
And it almost cost me everything.

1278
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:14,168
Enjoy your victory, Han.

1279
01:45:17,337 --> 01:45:18,338
Our victory.

1280
