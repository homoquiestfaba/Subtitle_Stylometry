4
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,489
The shadow monster woke up.

5
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,650
It saw the boy
in the pot and said.

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,246
"Mmm. I'm starving."

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,688
"I'm going to eat you up."

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,004
So the monster opened
his mouth wide and...

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,687
swallowed
the little tailor whole.

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,961
The boy fell

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,361
and fell into a dark cave

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,806
filled with slime...

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,321
Is that it?

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,369
That's all
I could come up with.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,768
Well, you'll think
of something tomorrow.

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,161
Let's go to bed.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,921
But I'm not sleepy and I
haven't finished it yet.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,169
I know, sweetie, but Mommy's
tired from working all day

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,164
and she needs to sleep.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,646
Here, I'll carry you.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,251
God, you're heavy!

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,561
Your story needs an ending.

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,529
Let's see if I can help.

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,490
Let methink...

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,281
Remember the scissors the
tailor had given his son?

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,610
Well, suddenly he remembered
he still had them.

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,043
He took them out
and started cutting.

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,443
Snip, snip, snip...

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,690
Snip, snip, snip...

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,603
And the monster shouted:
"Ouch!"

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,008
"Who's cutting me?"
And the little tailor...

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,764
I know, I know!

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,844
The boy cuts his way out,

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
makes himself
a monster-skin coat

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,404
and the arrows couldn't hurt him any more.
I'll finish it right now.

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,961
You're going to sleep or you'll
be tired in the morning.

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,241
Mom...

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,330
We'll get the little boy out of the
monster's belly in the morning.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,804
Don't shut it, Meow is still outside.
He might want to come in.

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,803
No dreaming
about monsters, okay?

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,401
Come!

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,041
Come!

43
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,171
Leave her alone, monster!

44
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,246
Let him go!

45
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,481
Mommy!

46
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,241
Mommy!

47
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,324
Mommy, Mommy!

48
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,001
There, there...

49
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,921
It's over, sweetie.
There, there...

50
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,768
The monster came in
through the window.

51
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,890
It wanted to take me away.
It was... It had no face.

52
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,649
There's no monster in here.
It was only a nightmare.

53
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,930
It was only a nightmare.

54
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,321
Don't worry.

55
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,448
It's over.
What if he comes back?

56
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,243
If he comes back, close your
eyes and count to five.

57
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,448
When you open them,
he'll be gone, you'll see.

58
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,843
I'm going to call her.
She is driving me crazy.

59
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,921
I can't stop
thinking about her.

60
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,525
Oh, I'm sure Carol would
be very happy about that.

61
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,090
Fuck off.
You're not an angel.

62
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,526
Don't tell me
you never thought about it.

63
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,967
Listen, mate, I'm
very happy with what I've got.

64
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,123
I mean, what could be so wrong

65
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,645
with a bit of
no-questions-asked,

66
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,131
harmless fun with
a filthy stranger

67
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,247
to spice up your love life?

68
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,210
Just as long as Carol
doesn't find out.

69
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,361
And if she does?

70
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,240
I'd deny it, wouldn't you?

71
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,361
Listen, mate, if I were you,

72
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,886
I'd just get it out of the way
and tell her everything now.

73
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,485
Fuck off!

74
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,121
Come on!

75
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,844
Keep an eye on Frank.
I have to call my daughter.

76
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,366
She is just very lonely.

77
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,851
She must miss you.

78
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,003
Yes, she does. She misses me very
much, but my brother's there, so...

79
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,521
Send them my love.

80
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,728
I will. That's nice
of you, thank you.

81
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,369
Yeah, I know, she is old.

82
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,371
Hey, Dad.
Where are you?

83
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,805
<i>Sorry, sweetheart.
I'm still at work.</i>

84
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,961
<i>I'm gonna be another hour.</i>

85
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,806
That's too bad. Grandma
made me her famous cake.

86
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,961
<i>Yeah, don't tell me,</i>

87
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,646
<i>chocolate, jam in the middle
and fake cream on top.</i>

88
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,927
<i>Is Mum there?
Can I talk to her?</i>

89
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,047
Sure.

90
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,006
Dad wants to talk to you.

91
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,480
Hey, baby.

92
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,929
Yeah. Okay.

93
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,764
Mia, it's so good to see you.

94
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,241
Where is Winnie going?

95
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,405
Yeah? Okay,
love you, too. Bye.

96
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,767
Hey, Winnie, where are you?

97
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,721
Winnie, where are you?

98
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,086
Where are you going?

99
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,961
What have you found?

100
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,246
<i>"Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name."</i>

101
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,844
<i>"After many, many
years, he was free."</i>

102
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,040
<i>"He wasn't young or old,
or ugly or handsome."</i>

103
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,366
<i>"He had no shape, he
didn't even have a face."</i>

104
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,130
<i>"He remembered a boy with a
face that looked like him."</i>

105
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,888
<i>”Hollowface had
to find the boy."</i>

106
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,563
<i>"He had to
find his face."</i>

107
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,967
<i>"Until one night, Hollowface
finally found a face to steal."</i>

108
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,207
<i>“It was a little boy
staring out of a window."</i>

109
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,362
<i>”Hollowface wanted
the boy's face"</i>

110
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,249
<i>“more than anything
else in the world."</i>

111
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,486
<i>"Without a face,"</i>

112
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,166
"he had nothing."

113
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,810
"So he devised a plan."

114
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,046
"First,"

115
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,444
"he'd separate the boy
from his parents."

116
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,124
"Then he'd take him
back to his lair."

117
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,167
"He'd rip off his face
and wear it himself."

118
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,851
"That way,
everybody would love him."

119
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,721
"The next night,."

120
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,166
"Hollowface
dressed up as a man"

121
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,446
"and went back
to the boy's house."

122
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,685
"He ran up
the wall quickly."

123
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,562
"He slipped
through an open window."

124
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,762
"He found the boy's room
and slipped inside."

125
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,086
"The boy was sleeping."

126
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,482
"Hollowface moved
closer and closer,"

127
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,646
"and closer."

128
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,846
Continue, Mia.

129
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,481
That's all I have.

130
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,801
You haven't finished it?

131
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,126
I didn't know how to.

132
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,406
It's not bad.

133
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,126
You've hooked your audience and
left us with a cliff-hanger.

134
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,690
Try to finish it for next week.

135
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,681
Well, we are all
looking forward

136
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,364
to finding out what
happens next, aren't we?

137
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,521
See you later.

138
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,409
Oh, what time is
the party again?

139
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,482
6:00. Don't forget.

140
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,324
Okay, bye!
See you.

141
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,890
Hey!
You're late.

142
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,485
Sorry.
Who is she?

143
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,731
You're sweaty. Come, you
have to do the cake.

144
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,844
Hey, birthday girl!

145
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,441
Daddy!

146
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,850
Happy birthday.

147
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,601
It's a teddy bear!

148
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,244
We got you something else, too.

149
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,361
Wow, thanks.

150
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,001
It's so cool!

151
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,366
I've wanted one
of them for ages!

152
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,169
Great.
Oh, yes.

153
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,043
You know, it's actually an
antique, it's nearly 50 years old.

154
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,121
An old
teddy bear. Cool.

155
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,882
I love it, Dad, really.

156
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,089
So, how old are you again?
Nine? Ten?

157
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,161
Dad.

158
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,446
Four?

159
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,608
Okay, guys.
It's time.

160
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,850
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

161
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,969
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

162
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,565
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mia.</i>

163
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,929
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

164
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,441
Whoo!

165
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,488
<i>Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.</i>

166
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,363
<i>After many, many
years, he was free.</i>

167
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,401
<i>When Hollowface
came out of his lair,</i>

168
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,244
<i>the people looked
right through him.</i>

169
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,530
<i>It was like he was in visible.</i>

170
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,968
<i>He saw people in the street,
talking and kissing.</i>

171
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,571
<i>And he knew that, without a
face, no one could love him.</i>

172
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,690
<i>Hollowface kept hunting for
a boy to steal his face.</i>

173
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,125
<i>He looked everywhere, in
every window of every house.</i>

174
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,326
<i>Until one night, he found a
house with a child inside.</i>

175
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,566
<i>And an open window.</i>

176
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,723
<i>He crept through the rooms</i>

177
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,805
<i>and down the corridor,</i>

178
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,609
<i>where he saw a girl
who was still awake.</i>

179
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,324
<i>So he crept closer, and closer.</i>

180
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,006
<i>And he forgot all about
hunting for the boy.</i>

181
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,529
<i>Now, Hollowface
wanted the girl's face</i>

182
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,250
<i>more than anything else
in the world.</i>

183
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,449
<i>So, he devised a plan.</i>

184
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,887
<i>He would hide in the
dark corner of her room</i>

185
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,884
<i>and wait for her to go to
sleep, and then he would...</i>

186
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,045
I really want one.

187
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,167
One?

188
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,804
Just one.
No.

189
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,291
Yes, just one.
No.

190
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,766
No, don't.

191
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,130
You don't need it.
I do.

192
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,041
That's pathetic.

193
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,641
Mia.

194
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,281
Mia, go to your room.

195
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,930
What is it? What's
the matter, sweetheart?

196
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,729
Mia, you've school
tomorrow, go.

197
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,681
John.

198
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,205
Come on, it's her birthday.

199
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,444
Are you okay, birthday girl?

200
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,167
I can't sleep.

201
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,485
Too much Coca-Cola?

202
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,561
It's not that.

203
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,043
No? What is it then?

204
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,042
Come on,
let's get you into bed.

205
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,242
Oh, I can see
you love my present.

206
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,246
Dad, I'm 12 years old.

207
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,361
Did you hear that?

208
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,128
Sorry, mate, I think you
should've stayed in the shop.

209
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,521
Looks like she is just a little
bit too grown-up for you.

210
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,202
Oh, yeah. She's wearing
lipstick and everything.

211
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,609
Come on,
you should try to sleep.

212
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,251
Good night, sweetheart.

213
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,881
I love you, Dad.

214
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,881
I love you, too.

215
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,285
One, two, three, four, five.

216
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,801
"He was a murderer
from the beginning,

217
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,608
and did not abide in the truth,

218
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,482
because there is
no truth in him.

219
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,721
If ye continue in my word,

220
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,246
then ye are
my disciples indeed.

221
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,483
And ye shall know the truth

222
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,642
and the truth
will make you free."

223
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,289
Wait for us here.

224
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,609
We can do it here if you like.

225
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,330
You have to say, "Hail,
Mary, full of grace."

226
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,245
Hail, Mary, full of grace.

227
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,925
The Lord is with thee.

228
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,131
When was your last confession?

229
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,921
I don't know.

230
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,606
I don't remember.

231
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,841
That's okay.

232
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,130
Go ahead, tell me.

233
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,442
You needn't be ashamed.

234
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,967
The Lord is good

235
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,804
and always forgives us.

236
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,360
Come on.

237
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,965
It can't be that bad.

238
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,849
Come on, Juan.
We're leaving.

239
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,083
No, no, no.
Keep going.

240
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,321
Sorry, mate.

241
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,283
Come on, you.
Concentrate.

242
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,884
You've gotta get
all that done by today.

243
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,241
You're the boss.

244
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,686
Help!

245
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,041
Help!

246
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,241
Help!

247
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,164
Please, mate, hurry,
I'm gonna fall!

248
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,811
John, help!

249
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,885
I can't hold on. Come on,
John, hurry up, mate!

250
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,520
Hurry up, I'm gonna
fucking let it go.

251
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,641
Hold on!

252
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,000
John!

253
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,080
<i>John! I'm going to fall!</i>

254
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,969
<i>Frank!
Frank! Frank!</i>

255
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,370
- Dad?
- Jesus.

256
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,446
You scared the life out of me!

257
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,286
Are you okay, sweetheart?
What's the matter?

258
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,486
I had a nightmare.

259
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,201
What was it about?

260
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
Come, Mia.

261
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,849
Come on, let's go back to bed.

262
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,081
You have school tomorrow.

263
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,925
What if the nightmare
comes back?

264
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,206
Come on.

265
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,567
Dad, where are we going?

266
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,880
Come on, it's fine.

267
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,041
Shit.

268
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,561
Dad.

269
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,563
Why are you standing
out there? Come on.

270
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,571
What are you doing?

271
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,926
Yes, got it.

272
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,287
Do you remember this?

273
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,684
The anti-nightmare book!

274
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,286
Dad, this is ridiculous.

275
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,485
Come on. Come and sit down.
Haven't read this in ages.

276
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,490
Come on.

277
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,766
Now, which one shall we read?

278
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,524
That one.
This one?

279
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
Okay. So...

280
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,727
"if a big red devil with big
teeth and claws comes to you"

281
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,886
"and tries to squeeze you in its
jaws, just light it up and say..."

282
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,761
Dad.

283
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,726
Oh, you're
too grown... "Boo!"

284
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,765
"And you'll see it's just a shadow
and you can see it through."

285
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,647
See, monsters are cowards.

286
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,245
If you stand up to them,
they run away.

287
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,441
Not this one.

288
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,321
This one's different.

289
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,289
They're all the same.
All cowards.

290
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,010
And you know
they'd never dare come

291
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,889
into this house if
they know I'm here.

292
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,250
But he's already inside.

293
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,170
What do you mean?
Where?

294
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,361
I don't know.

295
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,483
I think he spies on me
when I'm asleep.

296
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,330
I know he's there.

297
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,406
Right.

298
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,801
Now,

299
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,328
to kill a monster, you
have to enter their story.

300
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,848
See, they think
you're gonna run away,

301
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,644
but if you enter their story,

302
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,328
they're screwed.
So...

303
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,682
Now, there's something missing.

304
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,444
Ah! Perfect.

305
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,764
Wow! There he is.

306
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,004
There's our monster.

307
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,407
So,

308
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,564
you think you're scary, huh?

309
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,560
Now, listen, mate.

310
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,326
It's the end of the road.

311
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,451
We've had enough.

312
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,928
You cannot keep bothering
my daughter at night.

313
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,648
Okay, stand back.

314
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,928
Whoa.
Look at him go.

315
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,291
Wow.

316
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,366
Basketball face, go.

317
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,566
Look at his face.

318
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,606
Ooh.

319
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,401
Spooky.

320
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,891
He looks so angry.

321
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,600
What the hell are you doing?

322
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,171
Are you crazy?
What is this?

323
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,361
Mia, go to your room.

324
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,085
It's all right.
We were just playing.

325
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,128
What do you mean "playing"? You
could have burned the house down.

326
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,611
She had a nightmare.

327
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,250
We were just getting rid of it.

328
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,367
What do you mean
"getting rid of it"?

329
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,805
What do you mean?
What is this?

330
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,769
Sue. It was a game.

331
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,487
Throw this thing away before
it stinks up the whole house.

332
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,241
Mommy!

333
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,644
Mommy!

334
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,001
Juan...

335
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,168
It's okay, sweetie.
There, there.

336
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,965
It's over.

337
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,966
Please, come in.

338
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,561
Juan.

339
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,121
Juan.

340
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,807
Father Antonio is
here to see you.

341
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,604
He doesn't seem
to have a fever.

342
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,647
Hi, Juan.

343
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,170
My name is Antonio.

344
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,451
Do you remember me?

345
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,961
Look.

346
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,204
I brought your toy.

347
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,885
I'll leave it here, okay?

348
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,201
Your mother says you're
having trouble sleeping.

349
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,201
Go away.

350
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,804
Why do you say that?

351
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,569
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

352
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,688
I had nightmares
at your age too.

353
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,010
They aren't nightmares.

354
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,971
What are you scared of?

355
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,361
Witches?

356
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,446
No such thing.

357
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,168
And the bogeyman
isn't real either.

358
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,367
My parents told me about him
so I'd finish my dinner.

359
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,006
It's just a story.

360
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,083
You needn't be
afraid of stories.

361
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,085
Here's what we'll do:

362
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,767
You tell me what
you're scared of,

363
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,849
and I'll tell you
what scares me, okay?

364
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,529
I have a friend I talk to
every day who I can't see.

365
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,005
I'm scared...

366
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,569
my friend won't answer me.

367
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,570
That I'll talk to him
and he won't say anything.

368
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,404
Now it's your turn.

369
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,811
What are you scared of?

370
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,091
Hollowface.

371
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,770
Who is Hollowface?

372
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,200
Mia, what's the matter?

373
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,725
What is it?
What's wrong?

374
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,126
Tell me.

375
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,881
He's here.

376
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,846
He's inside.

377
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,650
No, come on, sweetheart.

378
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,528
There's nobody here,
it's just you and me.

379
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,721
Look.

380
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,086
Daddy, look.

381
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,886
Mia, get out.

382
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,881
Get out!

383
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,561
Dad!

384
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,361
Dad!

385
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,041
Dad!

386
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,201
Help me!

387
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,965
John!

388
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,971
- John, what's going on?
- Call the police!

389
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,521
Call the police!

390
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,161
Please.

391
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,721
Just let her go.

392
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,971
Don't hurt her.

393
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,688
My God! Sweetheart,
are you okay?

394
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,120
Are you okay?

395
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,841
What's going on?

396
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,843
There was a fucking
man in the room.

397
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,410
Are you okay?
Are you Okay? Baby...

398
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,046
It's okay, it's okay.

399
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,331
Awful business.

400
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,164
I think he must've
come in through the window.

401
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,241
I chased after him,
but he'd gone.

402
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,160
Did you see his face? Could
you give us a description?

403
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,643
It was dark.
He had a hood on.

404
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,364
Get that to forensics, George.

405
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,525
Now, once an intruder
has been seen,

406
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,204
he very rarely comes back.

407
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,161
We'll get him.
Don't worry, Mr Farrow.

408
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,641
Thank you.

409
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,970
He said not to worry. He said
he definitely won't come back.

410
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,486
It's okay.

411
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,723
You sit down here, lovely.

412
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,411
Has she said anything?

413
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,807
What do you want her to say?

414
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,566
She's terrified.

415
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,560
Are you okay?

416
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,884
What is it, sweetheart?
Talk to me.

417
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,607
Mia.

418
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,045
Talk to me.

419
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,643
Sweetheart,
tell me what's wrong.

420
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,041
Mia.

421
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,764
Sweetheart, what is it?

422
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,043
One, two, three, four...

423
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,725
Mommy, Mommy!

424
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,201
Juan...

425
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,201
How are you?

426
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,321
Everything okay?

427
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,967
No wonder the father ran off.

428
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,086
Did she tell you that?

429
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,000
No.

430
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,882
She speaks only of a presence,

431
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,448
that there's something
inside the boy.

432
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,043
They're both nuts,
the boy and the mother.

433
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,205
They would spook anyone.

434
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,809
She told you more
than she told me.

435
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,767
You don't know
how to treat women.

436
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,250
Will you help them?

437
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,564
What do you want me to do?

438
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,443
I don't know. Make them
think you got rid of it.

439
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,005
Got rid of what?

440
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,407
We're talking about
something very serious.

441
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,607
It wouldn't have
to be official.

442
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,129
It would be like a placebo.

443
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,491
Antonio, you can't perform
such a serious ritual

444
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,246
just to settle the nerves
of a crazy woman.

445
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,289
No matter how pretty she is.

446
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,091
You can't play around
with this stuff, damn it.

447
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,450
Leave them alone.

448
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,367
This is a job
for a psychiatrist,

449
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,610
not for us.

450
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,286
And then he leapt
from your window?

451
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,804
Oh, Mia. I'm sorry.

452
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,204
What a terrible thing to go
through, it must be terrifying!

453
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,929
And you haven't been able
to speak ever since?

454
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,644
Or you haven't wanted to?

455
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,081
Things and...
It's important I know.

456
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,326
You can't.

457
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,720
You know, it's all
right to be afraid.

458
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,081
I get scared too sometimes.
Everyone does.

459
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,085
Please, come with me.

460
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,611
As there's nothing physically
preventing your daughter from speaking,

461
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,809
her silence is an acute
emotional response

462
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,769
to the severe shock
she experienced.

463
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,885
So what do we do?

464
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,250
Oh, you have to be patient.

465
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,247
Should she keep
going to school?

466
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,321
Oh, yes, absolutely.

467
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,004
You don't want to
disrupt her routine,

468
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,162
but I will need to
see Mia every day.

469
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,321
Every day?

470
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,851
Mr Farrow,

471
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,562
I'm sure you want to avoid
Mia re-living the experience

472
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,608
through flashbacks
or recurring nightmares.

473
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,926
We want to facilitate

474
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,048
the successful,
emotional processing

475
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,248
of the trauma through
basic counseling.

476
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,684
During the sessions, Mia
will confront her fears.

477
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,882
We've found the method to be extremely
effective for the children...

478
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,242
<i>Hollowface
did not give up.</i>

479
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,003
<i>He would wait for the right moment
to rip off the girl's face.</i>

480
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,246
<i>Hollowface crept closer,
and closer and closer.</i>

481
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,450
You haven't got one
that's a bit quieter?

482
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,567
Quieter?

483
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,127
Wouldn't have a Chihuahua
as a guard dog, would you?

484
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,440
This is a Rottweiler.

485
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,128
It's an excellent choice.
Complete security package.

486
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,565
No more worries.

487
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,607
How about...

488
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,481
I made you something to eat.

489
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,051
You're doing your homework?

490
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,211
Listen, Mia, you don't have to
do it if you don't want to.

491
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,925
"Want to." Okay.

492
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,368
Come, come here.
Come here. Sit.

493
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,651
You can
only access the images

494
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,324
on the central Web site
with a password.

495
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,401
It's very secure.

496
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,081
Yes, hi, mate, yeah. I need to
enter a password for a customer.

497
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,009
Name, John Farrow.
Yep.

498
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,564
One, nine, six, seven.

499
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,241
Hi, Juan.

500
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,486
How are you?

501
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,121
Remember me?

502
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,041
Juan.

503
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,121
Juan.

504
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,248
Mommy, I'm having fun!

505
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,481
We're leaving.

506
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,403
We can't be here.

507
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,681
Let's go.

508
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,401
Come on.

509
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,281
Juan...

510
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,962
<i>Hollowface crept
closer, and closer.</i>

511
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,322
<i>The girl knew that
Hollowface was there.</i>

512
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,804
<i>She could feel him
watching her.</i>

513
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,166
<i>She wanted to scream for help,</i>

514
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,766
<i>but when she opened her mouth
she couldn't make a sound.</i>

515
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,405
<i>Her parents couldn't
keep her safe</i>

516
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,245
<i>because Hollowface
was already inside.</i>

517
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,167
<i>He'd made a new lair
right in her room,</i>

518
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,966
<i>in a dark corner everyone
had forgotten about.</i>

519
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,887
<i>His new lair was big
enough for both of them.</i>

520
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,441
<i>Hollowface would drag
the girl into his lair</i>

521
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,488
<i>and keep her there in the dark,</i>

522
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,484
<i>imprison her, away from
her parents, forever.</i>

523
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,964
<i>Then she wouldn't
need her face ever again.</i>

524
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,688
<i>He started calling her
to his lair.</i>

525
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,283
<i>She felt his claws
reaching out to her.</i>

526
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,725
John!

527
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,842
Mia, are you okay?
Are you okay?

528
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,449
<i>She's fine now. Her
blood pressure is very low.</i>

529
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,521
<i>She needs to rest.</i>

530
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,090
<i>We're going to run
some allergy tests.</i>

531
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,404
Anaphylactic shock is a severe
hypersensitivity body reaction,

532
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,005
but I don't want you
to worry, Mrs Farrow,

533
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,411
we will find what triggered it.

534
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,251
In the meantime,
I'm gonna prescribe

535
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,084
some intravenous
adrenaline and sedatives

536
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,366
in case of emergency.

537
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,651
If she loses consciousness and
the ambulance takes too long,

538
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,131
you can inject it yourself.

539
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,767
It takes only a couple of
seconds to take effect.

540
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,966
I'll have a nurse
show you how it works.

541
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,041
Okay. Thank you.

542
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,811
I'll go get a nurse.

543
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,646
<i>Could you
give us a description?</i>

544
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,849
Yeah, he looked really weird.

545
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,765
It was like...

546
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,840
It was like he was deformed.

547
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,521
Deformed?

548
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,810
But it's a good job you installed
those security cameras.

549
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,529
I'll have one of my men
check the coverage.

550
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,961
But we'll need your password.

551
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,041
Yeah, of course.

552
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,891
Sorry, would you excuse me?

553
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,761
Hey, how is she?

554
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,729
She's all right.
She's all right.

555
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,646
It's Dave.

556
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,844
Please, take him. He's been
calling the whole time.

557
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,561
Hello?

558
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,161
Mrs Farrow,

559
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,200
can you tell me
what happened tonight?

560
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,330
<i>I'm calling
because your mother asked me to.</i>

561
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,447
<i>Your mother wants us to be...</i>

562
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,726
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

563
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,086
I'm taking care
of the situation.

564
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,207
She is worried about Mia.

565
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,721
How is she, John?

566
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,371
I didn't see him I just...

567
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,481
<i>John?</i>

568
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,767
Dave, I can't talk right now.
Sorry, I've gotta go.

569
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,326
Dave, how are they?

570
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,605
They'll be fine.

571
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,567
Sit down.

572
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,410
Come with me, Juan.

573
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,721
Lie down.

574
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,968
We're going to pray together.

575
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,604
I'm going to say a prayer

576
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,444
and repeat after me, all right?

577
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,088
Mommy says you're going to
make Hollowface go away.

578
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,281
That's right.

579
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,046
Jesus will come,
he'll grab Hollowface

580
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,321
and poof.

581
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,244
He'll throw him into a pit
so deep he'll never get out.

582
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,204
But Hollowface can fly.

583
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,284
Juan, keep quiet
and obey the father.

584
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,127
Cross yourselves.

585
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,606
Give me your hand.

586
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,922
"You, Lord, are my refuge.

587
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,845
He shall deliver thee from
the snare of the fowler

588
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,889
and from
the noisome pestilence."

589
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,161
Repeat it.

590
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,521
"You, Lord, are my refuge.

591
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,326
He shall deliver thee from
the snare of the fowler

592
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,885
and from
the noisome..."

593
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,565
"From
the noisome pestilence."

594
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,041
"From
the noisome pestilence."

595
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,560
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,

596
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,328
nor for the arrow
that flaith by day."

597
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,161
Juan.

598
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,601
Please.

599
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,920
I don't want to.

600
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,286
That's all right.

601
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,803
We'll try something else.

602
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,486
I'll pray

603
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,091
and you repeat it
to yourself in silence.

604
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,080
Close your eyes.

605
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,361
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,

606
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,968
nor for the arrow
that flaith by day."

607
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,686
I can't.

608
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,571
I can't do it.

609
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,726
I can't expel him
if I don't know who he is.

610
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,010
You know who he is, don't you?

611
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,690
He has no face.

612
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,202
His face is hidden.

613
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,050
I can't see it.

614
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,490
You can't see it because
he's wearing a hood, right?

615
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,281
Close your eyes.

616
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,444
Try to imagine his face.

617
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,521
Take it off.

618
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,290
Take off his hood.

619
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,561
Father, that's enough.

620
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,806
Good, Juan.

621
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,681
Good.

622
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,841
He's there.

623
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,441
Where, Juan?

624
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,481
There.

625
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,160
Where is he?

626
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,611
There's nothing there.

627
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,605
What do you see?

628
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,961
He's gone.

629
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,610
It's only a statue.

630
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,481
Luisa.

631
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,560
You can't help us.

632
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,848
There's nothing you can do.

633
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,370
It's only a statue.

634
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,043
You imagined the whole thing.

635
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,721
Luisa!

636
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,521
Luisa...

637
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,121
Tell me what you saw.

638
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,490
Mommy, where are we going?

639
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,443
I don't know.
Far away.

640
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,808
Juan, help me.
Close your suitcase.

641
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,089
Do you think he'll follow us?

642
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,965
No, because we're going far away.
Do you understand?

643
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,968
You saw him too, didn't you?

644
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,242
Juan, I didn't see anything.

645
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,564
You hear me?
Nothing.

646
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,681
What's going on?

647
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,361
Good morning, John.
Come through.

648
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,210
Is everything okay?

649
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,611
Sue, where's Mia?
Is she okay?

650
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,886
She's here, John.
She'll be fine.

651
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,401
Hello, John.

652
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,561
What is this?

653
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,048
Please, John, take a seat.

654
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,849
Mia knows that
she has the full love

655
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,331
and support of
both her parents,

656
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,045
especially you, John.

657
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,282
You have a very
special bond with her.

658
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,850
I should hope so,
I'm her father.

659
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,689
Susanna tells me that you haven't slept
well since your incident at work.

660
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,810
Well, I think we've
all had trouble sleeping

661
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,530
ever since a man
started appearing

662
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,886
in my daughter's
bedroom at night.

663
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,491
I understand.

664
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,246
John, there is
a very rare syndrome,

665
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,651
which is often
brought on by stress,

666
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,690
which occurs when two people's
psyches become entwined.

667
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,724
It's a shared disorder,
called "folie à deux."

668
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,040
When two people with
close emotional ties

669
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,324
share the same hallucination.

670
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,845
Hallucination?

671
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,405
There's no intruder, John.

672
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,881
It's in your imagination
and in Mia's.

673
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,484
What the fuck are
you talking about?

674
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,044
John, I'd like you to
look at this, please.

675
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,001
Play that again.

676
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,321
What is this?

677
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,561
There was no one there, John.

678
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,807
Nobody else in the room,
but you and your daughter.

679
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,087
Mr Farrow.

680
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,481
Who the fuck are you?

681
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,001
This is David Wareton
from Social Services.

682
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,524
We're all here
to help you, John.

683
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,208
The condition can be treated very
successfully through therapy,

684
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,441
but, John,
the first step will be

685
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,124
to separate you
from Mia for awhile.

686
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,925
If you have nowhere else to go,

687
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,081
we can help you out with that.

688
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,524
I recommend that you speak
to my colleague, Dr Nowinski.

689
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,721
He said he'll treat you.

690
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,091
This is ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense.
I was in the fucking room!

691
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,890
He was there, he was
attacking my daughter.

692
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,770
Sue, you were there, tell them.

693
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,167
Sue.

694
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,721
Tell them!

695
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,882
Mr Farrow,
you need to calm down.

696
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,931
I didn't see anything.

697
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,528
You saw the video.
There's nobody there.

698
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,970
I don't fucking believe you.

699
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,528
So you think
I'm crazy, do you?

700
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,366
Don't worry.

701
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,643
By the time you get home,
I'll be out.

702
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,850
<i>Mia,
when we get home,</i>

703
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,885
Daddy is not gonna be there.

704
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,562
We have to separate you
for a little while.

705
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,961
Mum says you've been
writing a story at school.

706
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,684
Who is Hollowface?

707
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,841
Susanna, it might
be easier for Mia

708
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,445
if you left us alone
for a minute.

709
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,802
Mia, is there something
you want to tell us?

710
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,008
Did your father
tell you the story?

711
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,802
You know Hollowface isn't real?

712
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,841
Okay, Mrs Farrow...

713
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,800
If he comes near
the house again,

714
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,882
Mrs Farrow, please let
us know immediately.

715
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,166
Yes, I will.

716
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,204
We can get a court order.
No, no, no.

717
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,169
It won't be necessary,
seriously.

718
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,481
Okay.

719
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,121
So, this is the room.

720
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,646
It's a nice room, Mia.

721
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,402
Do you mind if we talk outside?

722
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,368
Mia, I'm gonna be back
in a minute, yeah?

723
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,561
Mia.

724
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,446
What if we go for a nice
yummy meal tonight?

725
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,369
Yeah? Like a Chinese restaurant?
What do you think?

726
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,446
Good idea?

727
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,681
Let's go.

728
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,121
Luisa,

729
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,209
can I speak with you
when you have a minute?

730
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,367
He says he wants
to talk to you.

731
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,766
Mommy!

732
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,521
Mommy!

733
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,688
Don't worry it must
just be a nightmare.

734
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,524
I'm sure he'll calm down.

735
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,680
Mommy!

736
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,241
One, two, three,

737
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,404
four, five.

738
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,401
There you'll stay forever.

739
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,211
<i>Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.</i>

740
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,006
<i>After many, many years,</i>

741
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,641
he was free.

742
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,646
John?

743
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,801
He's back.

744
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,847
Who is back?

745
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,761
You know who.

746
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,282
I don't know what
you're talking about, son.

747
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,121
Yes, you do.

748
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,641
No.

749
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,566
It can't be.

750
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,447
You said I made him up.

751
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,161
That I was dreaming.

752
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,406
You lied to me.

753
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,081
I'm sorry.

754
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,610
I'm so sorry.

755
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,402
He's hurting Mia.

756
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,563
I was only trying
to protect you.

757
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,241
From what?

758
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,001
Son...

759
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,640
Forgive me.

760
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,566
Tell me.

761
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,522
I'm sorry, I had to lie to you.

762
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,930
He came to take you that night.
It wasn't a nightmare.

763
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:22,208
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

764
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,408
Three, four, five...

765
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,520
Come on. Baby!

766
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,127
It's me!

767
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,441
John, she can't breathe!

768
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,648
What's happening?
The shot's not working.

769
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,091
Call an ambulance!

770
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,645
It's me. I'm here.
Can you hear me?

771
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,731
I know he's here and I know you're
afraid, but that's all over now,

772
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,406
because I know who he is
and I know why he came back.

773
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,441
Come on, keep talking,
keep talking, keep talking.

774
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,166
Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.

775
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,530
After many, many
years, he was free.

776
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,730
He wasn't young or old,
ugly or handsome.

777
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,165
He had no shape,

778
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,285
he didn't even have a face.

779
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,766
<i>They had locked him away in a dark,
tiny hole where the sun never shone.</i>

780
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,242
<i>He remembered a boy with a
face that looks like him.</i>

781
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,884
<i>Hollowface had to find the boy.</i>

782
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,324
<i>He had to find his face.</i>

783
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,163
<i>When he finally found
where the boy was hiding,</i>

784
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,163
<i>Hollowface didn't
know what to do.</i>

785
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,847
<i>Seeing the mother kiss the
boy made him feel envious.</i>

786
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,090
<i>He wanted to be like the boy.</i>

787
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,409
He wanted to be loved.
So he devised a plan.

788
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,801
First, he'd separate
the boy from his mother.

789
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,170
<i>Then he'd bring him
to his lair.</i>

790
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,007
<i>And he would rip off his
face and wear it himself.</i>

791
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,085
<i>Hollowface moved closer</i>

792
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:53,040
<i>and closer, and closer.</i>

793
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,761
You don't know the rest
of the story, but I do.

794
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,806
Hollowface couldn't find the
boy and that made him furious.

795
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,645
Where's the boy?

796
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,410
Leave her alone, monster!

797
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,611
Don't be afraid, son.

798
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,451
You look like me.

799
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,561
Mia.

800
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,840
Mia, you have to fight back.

801
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,521
You have to.

802
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,601
Mia.

803
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,811
You have to fight back.
You have to fight back, Mia.

804
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,448
Hollowface never
stole the boy's face.

805
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,449
Because Hollowface
didn't realise something.

806
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,768
The boy's mother
would never let him take

807
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,888
her son away without
putting up a fight.

808
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,926
Mommy!

809
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,607
Mommy!

810
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,251
Help me, son!

811
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,001
Help me!

812
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,081
No.

813
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:01,362
Because parents
are always willing

814
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,250
to do anything
to protect their children.

815
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,200
It's all right.
I'm here.

816
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,886
You're safe.

817
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,281
He's gone.

818
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,290
He will never come
back again, I promise.

819
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,486
It's over.

820
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,931
<i>Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.</i>

821
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:00,361
<i>Hollowface wasn't old or
young, ugly or handsome.</i>

822
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:06,129
<i>He had no shape, he
didn't even have a face.</i>

823
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,285
<i>He had nothing.</i>

824
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,206
<i>But now,</i>

825
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,841
<i>after many, many years,</i>

826
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,682
<i>he was free.</i>
