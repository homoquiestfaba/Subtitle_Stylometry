1
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,434
It won't work, MacGyver.

2
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,100
You can't do it!

3
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,434
Why not?!

4
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:55,334
I've done it before!

5
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:58,133
Not with 400 pounds.

6
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:01,100
It's no problem, I tell you!

7
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,701
Look out, Paul!

8
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:09,934
MacGyver!

9
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,801
Please... cut me loose.

10
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:14,968
Forget it!

11
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:16,501
Damn you!

12
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,501
We're both going to die!

13
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,133
No one's gonna die!

14
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,167
No one's gonna die.

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,667
No one's gonna die.

16
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,734
Afternoon. Name's MacGyver.

17
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,667
Invitation, please.
Quiet.

18
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:20,400
But slowly.

19
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,167
It's all right, uh...
I'm a guest.

20
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,400
I just haven't had time to

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,801
unpack the invitation.

22
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:30,567
Thank you, Mr. MacGyver.

23
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,734
You may enter.

24
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,901
Thank you very much.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,667
Good dog.

26
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,234
Exactly.

27
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,901
MacGyver.

28
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:36,901
There he is!

29
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:37,968
Hey!
Hey!

30
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,434
How's me old mate?

31
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:40,567
Happy birthday,
Paul.

32
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,000
Look at you.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
This is fantastic.

34
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
I can't believe it's
been fifteen years.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,901
Oh, come on,
don't remind me.

36
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:47,901
That's ridiculous.

37
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,100
All right, thanks
for coming.

38
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,133
It means a lot.

39
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,601
You kidding me?
I wouldn't miss this.

40
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:53,334
You only turn forty
once in your life, I hear,

41
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,901
although in your case...
Yeah-- I--

42
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,334
No, thank you.

43
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:58,367
So, uh, did you like the car

44
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,300
I had waiting for you?

45
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,534
Well, it's, uh...

46
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:02,567
red.

47
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,868
But, uh-- Yes, it's
very nice. Thanks.

48
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,634
Well, at least you didn't
roll it this time.

49
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:08,167
It's early.

50
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,934
Oh, by the way...

51
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:12,634
you still owe me
a new pair of ski poles.

52
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,667
Oh, much more
than that, my friend.

53
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:15,868
Much more.

54
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,067
I, uh...

55
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,734
I never told you how much
your letters meant

56
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:19,934
when I lost Elizabeth.

57
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,167
I'm sorry I couldn't have
been here for you.

58
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:24,634
We had some good times...

59
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:26,033
didn't we, Mac?

60
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,501
Absolutely the best.

61
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,667
Everything all right with you?

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Paul?

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,467
We have to talk.

64
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:39,467
Daddy...

65
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:42,968
Elise, Natalia.

66
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:45,934
Now you can actually meet
this wonderful man.

67
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,834
MacGyver,
my daughter Elise,

68
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,667
a doctoral candidate at 19.

69
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,767
And, uh, if you'll forgive
a little paternal bragging,

70
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,634
my most trusted
and gifted associate.

71
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:55,834
Papa, please.

72
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,033
Very nice to meet you again.

73
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,234
You, too.

74
00:04:58,234 --> 00:04:59,567
You look just like your mom.

75
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,067
Thank you.

76
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,701
MacGyver, Natalia Krimm,
a close friend of the family.

77
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,667
The man who carried me
up a mountain on his back.

78
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:07,968
Nice to meet you.

79
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:09,968
Likewise.

80
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:11,334
MacGyver and I spent the '70s

81
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:14,300
brainstorming solutions
to save the world.

82
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,267
What a shame they didn't work.

83
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,267
We're still trying.

84
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,067
There's the man I want to see.

85
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,400
Frederick Moran, Paul's brother.

86
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,734
I'm honored, Mr. MacGyver.

87
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:24,834
Frederick.

88
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:26,968
It's good to finally meet you.

89
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,300
Thanks for making
all this happen.

90
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,634
Oh. My great pleasure.

91
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:30,968
I wanted to meet you years ago,

92
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:34,067
but I was far too busy working,
to afford this place.

93
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,067
Excuse us.

94
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,734
I must steal
our guest of honor.

95
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:38,200
Of course.

96
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,634
Your trip was
satisfactory, I hope.

97
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, it was great.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,067
Um...

99
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,801
got a little bumpy
at your guard gate there.

100
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,868
Oh. My apologies.

101
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:47,968
Sadly, a necessity these days.

102
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:50,601
There's already been
one attempt on my life.

103
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,868
Really?

104
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,834
Yes, two years ago,
in the heart of the city.

105
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,701
It seems that nowadays anyone
with money is a target.

106
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:59,434
Particularly
a wealthy industrialist.

107
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:00,133
Excuse me.

108
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,534
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

109
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,100
Would you all come
a little closer?

110
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,968
Yes, that's right, thank you.
Please, come in.

111
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,234
I would like to introduce you to

112
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,968
a very special friend
of this family.

113
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:16,701
In fact, there would be
no celebration

114
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,200
of my brother's birthday today...

115
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,934
had it not been
for this man's heroism.

116
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,801
So please, I'd like you all
to raise your glasses

117
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:27,033
for a very special toast.

118
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,234
Get down. Get down.

119
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,033
It's nothing.
It's my shoulder.

120
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,234
Help the others.

121
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:07,234
Frederick.
It's Paul.

122
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:08,300
They've shot
Paul.

123
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,801
Call the paramedics.

124
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,634
No.

125
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:19,734
Paul. Paul.

126
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:27,200
Sample...

127
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,234
pack.

128
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:33,667
What?

129
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Paul.

131
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,934
Paul, come on.

132
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,567
Come on.

133
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:41,200
Paul.

134
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,567
Sir. They've taken your niece.

135
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,133
They've kidnapped her.

136
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,634
Elise.

137
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,067
I'm Tony Graves, family friend.

138
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:18,634
Where's Mr. Moran?

139
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:19,634
He's in the study, sir.

140
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:20,567
Thanks.

141
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm not interested in statements.

142
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,634
I want action.
Do you understand?

143
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:28,167
Look. Try to get hold of
yourself, Mr. Moran.

144
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,167
Frederick!

145
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,400
Frederick, I... I'm so sorry.

146
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,868
If there's anything I can do.

147
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:35,868
Thank you, Tony.

148
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:37,667
You can step aside, Mr. Graves,

149
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,634
and allow the police
to do their work.

150
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:40,801
Oh, sorry, captain,

151
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:43,234
I forgot how, uh,
easily you get confused.

152
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,200
Don't get smart with me, Graves.

153
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,834
I can make life
very difficult for you.

154
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,100
Oh, really?

155
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,267
Chief superintendent, this is
my home. Remember that.

156
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,300
And this is my investigation,
Mr. Moran.

157
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,934
We must all understand that.

158
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,100
Excuse me, sir.

159
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,634
Yes, what is it?

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,701
Thank you.

161
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,968
They found a body by the river.

162
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,200
It could be the girl's.

163
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,467
Can you wait here, please?

164
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,334
Mr. Moran, the face,
it's been battered.

165
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:36,467
Elise...

166
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,367
Oh, no.

167
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:57,434
From one generation to another.

168
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:59,167
This was to have been
the happiest week of my life.

169
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,467
Expectations of joy.

170
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,300
Renewed friendships.

171
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:07,801
And now, my brother is gone.

172
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:09,801
My whole family.

173
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:13,801
It's very hard.

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,734
They will always
live in our hearts.

175
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:21,200
It's a sad day for
all of us, Frederick.

176
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:24,734
MacGyver...

177
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,334
forgive me for ignoring you.

178
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,634
You came from so far...

179
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:29,767
No, don't even think about it.

180
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,501
Rest as long as you like.

181
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,801
My secretary will gladly handle

182
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:33,868
your return arrangements.

183
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,567
That won't be necessary,
Frederick.

184
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,501
I insist.
You're my guest.

185
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,267
Well...

186
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:42,667
I've changed my plans.

187
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,767
I'm not leaving.

188
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,300
Paul was too good a friend.

189
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,667
Not leaving?

190
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,834
MacGyver, please.

191
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,567
Let the police handle this.

192
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,534
Well, the police can have
their investigation,

193
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:54,801
I'll have mine.

194
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:56,534
Besides, I'm a new face in town.

195
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:58,868
Working alone, maybe I can do
some things the police can't.

196
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,968
You are indeed the man
Paul said you were.

197
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:06,167
Bless you, MacGyver.

198
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,367
My resources are
at your disposal.

199
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,300
I will support you
in any way I can.

200
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,601
Thank you.
Perhaps...

201
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,868
Tony can be of help too.

202
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:18,834
As a liaison.

203
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,400
Troubleshooter.

204
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,534
His background is Intelligence.

205
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
I'd be...

206
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,167
proud to help.

207
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:26,868
Good.

208
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,000
Good.

209
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,734
And, if we could persuade

210
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:32,701
our uniquely qualified--

211
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:32,834
No.

212
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,634
Frederick, please...

213
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:36,734
But Natalia...

214
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,234
I said no.

215
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,400
I'm sorry, MacGyver.

216
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:44,200
Look, it's getting late.

217
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,300
I could use a lift home.

218
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:10,701
Thank you for the lift.

219
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,434
I'm sorry if I offended you

220
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:17,634
with my reaction to Frederick.

221
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:19,234
Oh, it's kind of tough
to offend me.

222
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,534
Mind if I ask why
you did react like that?

223
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,501
I do mind, as a matter of fact.

224
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,467
Thank you for escorting me.

225
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,100
I think I'm quite capable
of letting myself in.

226
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,167
I bet.

227
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:35,767
Wait.

228
00:14:58,234 --> 00:14:59,067
Hey!

229
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:34,667
Damn them.

230
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:36,767
Damn them!

231
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,100
Any ideas?

232
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,133
Of course.

233
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,667
Terrorists, who else?

234
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:45,434
Why would they hit you?

235
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,334
I've been seen with Frederick.

236
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,667
Photographed. You know the press.

237
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,367
Always linking people together.

238
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,767
They love rumors.

239
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,200
With all due respect,

240
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,167
this looks like
more than just rumors.

241
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,767
Fortunately, I'm not dependent on

242
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:58,701
material possessions.

243
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,400
Whoop.

244
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:23,701
Well...

245
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,234
Looks like they forgot one of
your material possessions.

246
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:30,534
Please give it to me.

247
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,334
All right, look.

248
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:42,000
You move like a cat,
you handle a gun like a pro,

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,868
and you've got a poison
cartridge pen in your purse.

250
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,534
Is there anything
you want to tell me

251
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:49,000
about your...unique
qualifications?

252
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,267
There's nothing to tell.

253
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:51,634
Yeah, right.

254
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:54,467
I've run across a couple of
these things in my time.

255
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:57,300
And every one of them
belonged to a KGB agent.

256
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,033
Come on, Miss Krimm.

257
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,934
All right.

258
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:12,100
I was studying
languages in Moscow.

259
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,734
I was approached and
offered a job with the KGB.

260
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,834
Most of my time
working for them

261
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:17,834
was spent in London.

262
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,334
But it's over now.
Past.

263
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:23,501
I broke all ties
years ago.

264
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,300
So what do you do now?

265
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:29,000
Little work for Frederick.

266
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,634
Mostly I keep to myself.

267
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:44,801
Let me ask you something.

268
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,133
You still have contacts
in this town?

269
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,534
I told you, I broke
all ties years ago.

270
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:52,667
But you still know people, right?

271
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:55,033
Please...

272
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,300
leave me out of it.

273
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,334
I don't want to
renew those connections.

274
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:01,534
Hey. I'm not too familiar with
the terrorist scene around here.

275
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:03,033
I could use some help
getting in, okay?

276
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,234
I said no.

277
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:06,200
It's not my business.
I keep to myself.

278
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,434
Look...

279
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:15,968
the Morans have been a very
important part of my life,

280
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:18,133
and they have just
been crucified.

281
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,901
I was told you were
a good friend of the family.

282
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,334
Well, you've got a chance
to prove it right now.

283
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,033
I could use your help.

284
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,167
So could they.

285
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:31,534
Really.

286
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:36,901
Wow.

287
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:41,567
Yeah. Sleep well.

288
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:43,801
MacGyver.

289
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,534
Tell me what you need.

290
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:10,968
This is an honor, comrade.

291
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,200
To be on the same level

292
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,767
with someone of your rank.

293
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,267
Stop it, Nikolai.

294
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:16,701
This is the man I--

295
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:17,534
Did you bring the money?

296
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:25,968
Your turn.

297
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,334
This group is very dangerous.

298
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,367
They have no political agenda.

299
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,601
They're antiestablishment
anarchists.

300
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,267
They'll work for anyone.

301
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:40,067
Qaddafi, the I.R.A., you name it.

302
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:40,934
They're very violent.

303
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:44,868
Can I get in?

304
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:47,267
I can make contact
with their leader today.

305
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:49,367
His name is Joseph.

306
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:52,367
I'll take care of
the details. He trusts me.

307
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:52,968
But I warn you.

308
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,100
If they suspect you...

309
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,968
they will kill you.

310
00:19:58,968 --> 00:19:59,968
Set it up.

311
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,300
Gentlemen.

312
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,667
Which one's Joseph?

313
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:44,534
Joseph's watching.

314
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,100
First you got to prove
yourself against our best.

315
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:51,934
Ow.

316
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,367
Very impressive.

317
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,834
Now finish him off.

318
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:56,234
Go on.

319
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:59,234
You've earned it.

320
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:35,567
It's a stupid leader who
sacrifices his own men.

321
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,033
I was looking for professionals,

322
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:39,801
not a bunch of suicidal punks.

323
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:48,734
All right.

324
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,501
You've earned yourself
a private meeting.

325
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:53,567
You come with good references,

326
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:56,100
and Nikolai says you're solid.

327
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,601
We'll let you know
when and where.

328
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,067
Swell.

329
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,534
Yeah.

330
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,033
Nice bridge.

331
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,234
Yeah. Well, things are risky

332
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:34,400
at the moment, all right?

333
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Oh, feeling a little heat,
are you? Police?

334
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,434
No.
Who?

335
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:38,834
Big money.

336
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,167
The Moran job was for hire,
but something's turned.

337
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,567
That's why you're here.

338
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,801
Three of our strike team
have disappeared.

339
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,501
The other's afraid
to surface.

340
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:49,701
He hasn't shown
at our regular meeting spot.

341
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,501
Yeah, where's that?

342
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:52,767
Just listen.

343
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,767
I'll give you the information
you need.

344
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,934
The money knows
where we meet.

345
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,534
It's become very dangerous.

346
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:00,200
All right, so it's dangerous.

347
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,701
Where's this meeting place?

348
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,734
In the sewers.

349
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,300
We meet at the fourth quadrant.

350
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,167
Fourth quadrant. All right.

351
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,701
Our stray's coming to my place
tonight at 11:30.

352
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,033
Be there.

353
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,100
You'll get instructions
for your first assignment.

354
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,901
Wanna give me some hint
as to what that might be?

355
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:21,300
Our ace in the hole
stashed at the meeting spot.

356
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,934
The suit's own handwritten
request for the hit.

357
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:26,434
And photos he gave me
of the target.

358
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:29,467
You're gonna retrieve them
for us, tough guy.

359
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,767
Eleven-thirty,
all right? Be there.

360
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,567
Well, you can't go in
without it, MacGyver.

361
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:40,567
If you don't wear a wire,
we'll have no way of knowing

362
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,100
if anything goes wrong.

363
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,934
I don't like wires.

364
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:45,434
If something does go wrong,

365
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:46,701
they're impossible to explain.

366
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,434
Well, I'm telling you,
it's foolhardy.

367
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,467
You'll be walking in naked.

368
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:52,434
Look, just listen to me
on this, okay?

369
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:54,167
I'm experienced
in these matters.

370
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,434
So am I.

371
00:24:56,534 --> 00:24:57,567
Damn it, man--

372
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:58,367
What?

373
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,067
It was my, uh--

374
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:02,734
It was--

375
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:05,801
It was my understanding

376
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,834
that you were...open
to assistance.

377
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,634
Yeah. Assistance, yes.

378
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,400
Orders, no.

379
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,934
I'm not giving orders.
Tony...

380
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,334
why don't you go
and wait in the car?

381
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:19,534
Please?

382
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:21,367
I'll be down in a minute.

383
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,968
Okay.

384
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,200
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,100
Sometimes Tony can be
a little overbearing.

386
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,968
He's used to being in charge.

387
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,567
Yeah, so am I.

388
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:39,901
He means well.

389
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,400
And you are very stubborn.

390
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,200
Really?

391
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,167
It's part of your charm.

392
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,634
How can I help?

393
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,000
Okay. We know somebody
other than Joseph

394
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,200
was behind all this,

395
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,801
so you can start by making
a list of people

396
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,467
who might have wanted
Frederick dead.

397
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,033
You mean--?
Anybody you can think of.

398
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,934
Including his friends.

399
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:43,067
Ugh!

400
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:36,467
Paul.

401
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:54,100
What's going on here?

402
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,534
It's all right.

403
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,033
You're all right now.

404
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:06,801
Oh.

405
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:08,567
Why am I naked?

406
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:12,868
Nikolai found you in Soho
and called me.

407
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:14,434
You've been very sick.

408
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,400
Why are we in bed together?

409
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
You were burning up
with fever, then chills.

410
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,534
I-- I couldn't think
of what else to do.

411
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:27,067
Oh.

412
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:30,567
I saw this once in
an American movie.

413
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:34,033
We watched many of those
during KGB training.

414
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:36,033
Um...

415
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:40,534
Mind if I ask what
happened here, exactly?

416
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,534
The details are unimportant.

417
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:48,033
Let's just say your fever broke.

418
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,834
My fever?

419
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:53,901
We've lost a lot of time.

420
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,067
We should get to work.

421
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,601
What do you mean, "we"?

422
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:00,300
I'm just here to help.

423
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,634
Your clothes, sir.

424
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:14,601
Why did the terrorists
want to kill you?

425
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,100
They didn't.

426
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,901
I think it was the people
who hired them.

427
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:22,100
What?

428
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:23,567
Yeah.

429
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,133
My contact was hit.

430
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:30,701
The Moran attack
wasn't terrorist,

431
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:32,133
and it wasn't aimed at Frederick.

432
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:34,534
Who, then?

433
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:37,534
Paul.

434
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,400
Are you sure?

435
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,501
I think so.

436
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:47,901
There were some pictures of Paul

437
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,067
and a...

438
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:51,701
handwritten note from
whoever ordered the hit.

439
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:53,934
I was supposed to get 'em, but...

440
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:56,367
Do you know who?
Did you read the note?

441
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,567
No.

442
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:01,033
There wasn't time.

443
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,534
All I know is somebody
had Paul killed,

444
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:06,734
and that same somebody
wants me out of the way.

445
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:09,968
Who'd want to hurt dear Paul?

446
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:12,601
I don't know.

447
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:18,801
But something was bugging him
the day of the party.

448
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,901
He started to tell me, but...

449
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:25,834
Maybe it's got
something to do with his work.

450
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:32,200
I need to get into his lab.

451
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,167
Tony Graves can arrange that.

452
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,601
How?

453
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:39,501
His company funded Paul's work.

454
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,367
What's going on?

455
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,200
There's been a break-in
at Paul's lab.

456
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,701
A break-in?
Yeah, about an hour ago.

457
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:04,801
What were they after?

458
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:05,367
I don't know.

459
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,801
Thank you.

460
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:16,267
Dr. Massey?

461
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:17,868
This is Mr. MacGyver.

462
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:19,467
Dr. Massey, good to meet you.

463
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,300
Oh, of course, forgive me.
Paul's friend.

464
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,133
Oh, and, uh,
this is Natalia Krimm.

465
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,667
She's a close friend
of the Morans.

466
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:25,701
How do you do?

467
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:26,901
Well, doctor, it looks like--

468
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:28,767
Excuse me, doctor.
I'm sorry.

469
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:31,734
Is this what Paul was working on?

470
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:40,834
Paul was fine-tuning a portable
mass spectrometer he designed.

471
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,434
But not just any.

472
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:44,934
The most highly sensitive
ever developed.

473
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:46,467
For the START signatories.

474
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:49,167
Capable of measuring
the slightest nuclear presence.

475
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,300
Huh. Big stuff, huh?

476
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,801
It's such a tragedy.

477
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:54,267
The death of my brilliant
colleague,

478
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,801
and now the desecration
of his work.

479
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:57,467
Did you notice anything missing?

480
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:58,467
Oh, everything.

481
00:38:58,467 --> 00:39:00,200
His records, files,
all his samples.

482
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,334
Work in progress.

483
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:03,534
What samples?
Of what?

484
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:05,067
Well, Paul had just completed

485
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,234
the first air sample test

486
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:08,300
for the new machine,
from all over England.

487
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
Now everything's gone:

488
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,701
the samples,
records, results,

489
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:11,701
everything.

490
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:14,501
Graves.

491
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:15,767
I'm getting tired of finding you

492
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,100
at my crime scenes.

493
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,334
You have no business
here. Now, get out.

494
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:20,767
And that goes
for the rest of you--

495
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:23,000
Hey-- Excuse me,
chief superintendent,

496
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,200
but, um...

497
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,067
it was my company
that financed this lab.

498
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:27,834
I don't give a damn
what you financed

499
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:29,033
with your filthy money.

500
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,033
Watch it, Capshaw.

501
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,567
Don't threaten me, Graves.

502
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:34,634
I forgot what a tough guy
you were.

503
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:37,000
What was it?
Eleven counts

504
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,167
of excessive force, one death.

505
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,334
Oh, you don't frighten me,

506
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:41,834
you pompous little ass!

507
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,767
Hey, hey!
Come on, gentlemen.

508
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:44,934
Please.

509
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:48,601
I want this lab clearednow.

510
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:03,767
Dr. Massey?

511
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,000
Hm?

512
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:10,267
Paul mentioned the word
"samples" to me

513
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:11,701
just before he died.

514
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,734
Do you know anything
about his findings?

515
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,934
Whatsamples he might
have been referring to?

516
00:40:15,934 --> 00:40:17,334
No, that's my frustration.

517
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,934
Paul never spoke to anyone

518
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:20,300
about his work, except Elise,

519
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,467
God rest her soul.

520
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:24,501
Oh, she was his confidant.
Brilliant mind.

521
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:26,567
Of course, the man
lived for his research.

522
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:28,667
I mean, he slept here.
This was his second home.

523
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,701
Wait a minute.
Paul slept here?

524
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:33,067
Yes. Yeah, well, yes, at times.

525
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:34,501
He kept a little room upstairs.

526
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:47,968
Right. Clear the room, please.

527
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:53,701
It seems you don't
understand English.

528
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:55,167
Leave the room immediately.

529
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,033
MacGyver...

530
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:06,901
you're getting dangerously close

531
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,534
to interfering in my territory.

532
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:11,133
Now please, stay out
of my investigation.

533
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,200
Two minutes.

534
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,067
I just needed two
more minutes in that room.

535
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:37,834
Why?

536
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:42,834
I'm gonna take you home.

537
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:44,334
I'll contact you later.

538
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:45,901
What is this?

539
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:47,667
Have I outlived my usefulness?

540
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,734
Just try to understand, will you?

541
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:50,767
What?

542
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:54,100
Ten minutes ago we were
working as a team.

543
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,667
Now, suddenly, you don't trust me.

544
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,367
Look, this is nothing personal,

545
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,667
but right now, I can't
afford to trust anybody.

546
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:02,667
Damn you!

547
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,501
Who just saved your life?

548
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,534
Who nursed you back to health?

549
00:43:06,534 --> 00:43:08,767
Natalia, believe me...

550
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:10,033
you've helped a lot.

551
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:12,067
And I appreciate
everything you've done.

552
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:14,300
You need me, MacGyver.

553
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,734
Oh, I do, do I?

554
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:18,267
I'm a better spy than you are...

555
00:43:18,267 --> 00:43:20,701
in matters requiring deceit.

556
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,634
Capshaw's always hated Tony.

557
00:43:38,634 --> 00:43:40,367
He hides that well.

558
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,434
Years ago, Tony worked
for a brief time

559
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:44,100
with British Intelligence.

560
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,667
He was in American Intelligence

561
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,033
stationed in the U.K.

562
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:49,067
It all ended very badly
for him, though,

563
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:51,767
when a terrorist suspect
died during questioning.

564
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,400
Graves killed somebody?

565
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,501
That was never really determined.

566
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,801
But Capshaw had the misfortune
of being present

567
00:43:58,801 --> 00:43:59,901
as a young officer.

568
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:02,033
He's hated Tony
for it ever since.

569
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:04,868
Apparently, he feels
his reputation and career

570
00:44:04,868 --> 00:44:06,234
were permanently smeared.

571
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,133
Mr. MacGyver.
Yeah?

572
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:23,167
Your results.

573
00:44:24,434 --> 00:44:26,234
Thanks.

574
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,133
I don't believe it.

575
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:35,133
W-- What is it?

576
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:39,501
The air sample shows
high level of uranium isotope.

577
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:41,467
U-235.
So?

578
00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:44,734
It's what they use to make
nuclear bombs.

579
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:47,701
Uncontrolled nuclear material

580
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:50,100
is being processed
somewhere nearby.

581
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,634
In England?
But that can't be.

582
00:44:52,634 --> 00:44:54,200
Oh, well, this says it can.

583
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,300
Somebody's operating
a nuclear facility,

584
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,701
and Paul found it.

585
00:44:57,701 --> 00:44:58,801
Why?

586
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:00,200
The cold war is over.

587
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,334
I don't know.

588
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,033
Maybe it's just about...

589
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,200
money.

590
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,534
Money?

591
00:45:13,901 --> 00:45:15,734
Maybe.
Think about it.

592
00:45:16,968 --> 00:45:18,400
Terrorist groups.

593
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,901
Rogue nations like Iraq,
Iran, Libya,

594
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,934
they'd pay anything
for nuclear capability.

595
00:45:22,934 --> 00:45:24,701
And if there is somebody
who can supply 'em,

596
00:45:24,701 --> 00:45:27,467
I don't even want to
think of the implications.

597
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:30,234
I gotta find out where
the sample came from.

598
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:32,000
MacGyver.
No.

599
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,367
Listen to me. We're
both under surveillance.

600
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:36,634
We can't go back
to your place or mine.

601
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:38,100
You're a target.

602
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,200
We need a safe house
we can use as a base.

603
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,667
I'll find us one.

604
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:49,300
All right.

605
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:00,567
C-A-R...

606
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:03,634
C.

607
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:04,467
It's a C.

608
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:08,901
Thank you.

609
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:29,334
Look here.

610
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:34,200
The castle was last
purchased in 1983

611
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,501
by Lyndover Limited,
a trading company.

612
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:38,868
Thank you.
Okay.

613
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:51,968
"Graves."

614
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:52,267
You're a lucky guy.

615
00:48:52,267 --> 00:48:54,167
X-rays show no sign
of cerebral damage

616
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,667
or concussion.

617
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,634
However, I'd be more
careful about the company

618
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:58,901
I keep in the future.

619
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:02,300
Would you excuse us, doctor?

620
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,968
Yeah.

621
00:49:05,868 --> 00:49:08,901
Hey, chief. Now what?

622
00:49:08,901 --> 00:49:10,901
Well, "now what" is we're
gonna have a little talk

623
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:12,167
about life, MacGyver.

624
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:14,234
Life and manners.

625
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:16,701
All right.

626
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:17,701
Well...

627
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:19,200
when a stranger conducts

628
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,300
a private investigation
in my city

629
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,901
and refuses to share
his findings with the police,

630
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:25,501
I call that bad manners.

631
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,467
I agree.

632
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,200
So, what were
you doing at the, uh,

633
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,934
laboratory and the London Library?

634
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:35,968
You find something?

635
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,000
With all due respect,
chief inspector,

636
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,934
I don't feel free to
comment on that right now.

637
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:44,968
Don't test me, MacGyver.

638
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:47,734
You know...

639
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,200
throwing your allegiance

640
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,834
to scum like Tony Graves

641
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:52,367
can only bring you more trouble.

642
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:53,901
Like today.

643
00:49:53,901 --> 00:49:55,501
Nobody has my allegiance.

644
00:49:56,601 --> 00:49:57,968
That particular association

645
00:49:57,968 --> 00:50:00,000
makes me seriously
question your motives.

646
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,868
I have no association,
no obligation, no ties.

647
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,968
I am strictly in this
for personal reasons.

648
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:08,901
Well I do have obligations
and associations.

649
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:11,133
To Britain and
her subjects, MacGyver.

650
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,667
For your sake, let's hope
we're on the same side.

651
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,567
It doesn't make sense.

652
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:24,868
A nuclear plant,

653
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:27,601
built without detection,
and so close.

654
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:29,400
I've known Tony for many years.

655
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,767
I can't imagine him
being involved

656
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:32,100
in anything so repugnant.

657
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:34,767
Why even though...

658
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:37,467
What?

659
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,267
Tony always had
a very strong drive

660
00:50:40,267 --> 00:50:41,734
for material gain.

661
00:50:41,734 --> 00:50:44,901
That's why we had to
sever our business ties.

662
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:46,000
Really?

663
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,868
But selling nuclear weapons?

664
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:49,767
That's global terrorism.

665
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:51,434
Tony fought that all his life.

666
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:53,033
Look at his service record.

667
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:56,567
Twelve years, U.S. Intelligence,
an antiterrorist expert.

668
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:59,167
Yeah. I know.

669
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,467
I ran a background check on him,

670
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:02,434
and aside from that incident

671
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,400
with British Intelligence,
he was clean.

672
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,267
We must call in the authorities.

673
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:08,667
This is getting too big.

674
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:10,067
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute. J--

675
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,234
Don't we want to see
how deep this thing goes?

676
00:51:12,234 --> 00:51:13,734
Yes, we must.

677
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:15,200
For Tony's sake.

678
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,367
Chief Superintendent Capshaw
might very well use this

679
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:19,968
as an opportunity
for vengeance against him.

680
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:25,067
This note that you found...

681
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:26,634
was there anything on it?

682
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:28,601
A name, initials.

683
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:30,901
Anything that might lead us
to my brother's murderers?

684
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:38,067
Uh. No, I didn't get
a chance to read it.

685
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:39,868
Do what you have
to do, MacGyver.

686
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:41,334
I back you a hundred percent.

687
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:06,868
Graves.

688
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,267
Oh, man.

689
00:53:03,868 --> 00:53:05,300
Armed police.
Don't move!

690
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,067
Stay down!

691
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:11,334
I said, stay down!

692
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:12,434
I warn you, MacGyver,

693
00:53:12,434 --> 00:53:14,267
I get nervous in the presence
of murderers.

694
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:15,534
What? Wait a minute.

695
00:53:15,534 --> 00:53:16,968
Shut up.

696
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:17,734
Don't even try.

697
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,501
This yours?

698
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:24,400
Well, I'm sure it's
covered in prints.

699
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,067
Maybe even a blood sample.

700
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:27,367
Come on, that's a plant.

701
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:28,934
I didn't kill anybody.

702
00:53:28,934 --> 00:53:29,868
Oh, really?

703
00:53:29,868 --> 00:53:30,901
Sir.

704
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,734
So this wouldn't be
your watch crystal

705
00:53:34,734 --> 00:53:35,634
and bezel then?

706
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,467
Come on, this is a setup.

707
00:53:42,467 --> 00:53:43,501
Don't move!

708
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:45,267
You gotta listen to me!

709
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:47,667
I'm placing you under arrest for
the murder of Anthony Graves.

710
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:54,567
Aah! Ow.

711
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:55,534
After him!
Come on!

712
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:59,367
Ah.

713
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,133
Come on.

714
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,367
Ow.

715
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:18,367
Ow.

716
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,267
Was this door always like this?

717
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:48,601
No.

718
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:51,267
Can you get to the back
of the carriage, please. Now.

719
00:57:08,834 --> 00:57:11,234
He got out! You checked
every carriage?

720
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,701
Yeah.
Come on then! Come on.

721
00:57:59,834 --> 00:58:00,901
MacGyver.

722
00:58:00,901 --> 00:58:02,634
Where have you been?

723
00:58:02,634 --> 00:58:04,067
You set me up!

724
00:58:04,067 --> 00:58:05,133
Are you crazy?

725
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:06,801
Capshaw was waiting for me.

726
00:58:06,801 --> 00:58:09,133
Graves was dead,
and evidence againstme

727
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:10,868
was conveniently beside the body.

728
00:58:10,868 --> 00:58:11,968
Tony, dead?

729
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:14,567
Oh, that's good.

730
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:15,934
That's so very good.

731
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:18,300
The KGB should be proud of you.

732
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,000
MacGyver, I didn't do it.

733
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,434
You and Frederick
were the only ones

734
00:58:21,434 --> 00:58:22,501
who knew I was going there.

735
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,300
That's not necessarily true.

736
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,834
Yeah? Well then, who?!

737
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,000
All right.

738
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,601
Superintendent Capshaw.

739
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:31,968
I'm serious.
Think about it!

740
00:58:31,968 --> 00:58:33,701
You've been followed
from the start.

741
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:35,334
He could have followed us
to Frederick's,

742
00:58:35,334 --> 00:58:36,868
maybe even wired his study.

743
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:39,367
Tony could have been his partner.

744
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:41,133
So Capshaw knows
Tony was a suspect,

745
00:58:41,133 --> 00:58:42,701
kills him and frames you
for the crime.

746
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:45,934
It could have been
a conspiracy all along.

747
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:48,334
Tony had law-enforcement
assistance.

748
00:58:48,334 --> 00:58:50,033
And all that hostility
between them

749
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:52,200
was just a facade.

750
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,334
Capshaw could have ordered

751
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,767
the attack on you in the sewers.

752
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:56,868
That's how he got the evidence.

753
00:58:56,868 --> 00:58:58,267
If it had been me, why would I

754
00:58:58,267 --> 00:58:59,901
have bothered to save your life?

755
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:03,300
You dragged me
into this.

756
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,100
I wanted to put the KGB
behind me, remember?

757
00:59:11,601 --> 00:59:13,801
Don't you know how I feel?

758
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,434
I'm on your side, all the way.

759
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:28,734
I need to think.

760
00:59:42,467 --> 00:59:44,234
Nothing would surprise me
at this point.

761
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:48,868
And now I'm a suspect.

762
00:59:48,868 --> 00:59:50,901
That's beautiful.
Beautiful.

763
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:52,667
I can help.

764
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,267
My KGB contact, Nikolai,

765
00:59:54,267 --> 00:59:57,434
there's a rumor he's
found new employment.

766
00:59:57,434 --> 00:59:58,467
So?

767
00:59:58,467 --> 01:00:01,601
His expertise is
in nuclear facilities.

768
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:03,167
It could be
only one thing.

769
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:06,033
If it's true, I can verify
the location of the plant

770
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:07,968
and find out what kind of
security it has.

771
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:12,100
What makes you think
he'd tell you?

772
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,534
He'll tell me.

773
01:00:14,534 --> 01:00:16,033
I'm KGB, remember?

774
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:19,501
Ex-KGB, remember?

775
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:22,534
Of course.

776
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:28,801
The circumstances
do not relieve you

777
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:30,567
of your legal responsibilities.

778
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:32,300
My family has been murdered.

779
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,334
My only brother killed.

780
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:35,501
And you speak to me like this?

781
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:36,601
How dare you!

782
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:39,200
Mr. Moran. I am
requesting information

783
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,467
as to the where abouts
of Mr. MacGyver, a fugitive.

784
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:45,067
With holding such
information is a crime.

785
01:00:45,067 --> 01:00:48,200
I resent the accusation.

786
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,968
And your insensitivity,
chief superintendent.

787
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:53,267
Now get out.

788
01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:56,801
As you say.

789
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:12,667
Yeah?

790
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,334
I'm outside Nikolai's now.

791
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:16,467
We rendezvous in exactly one hour.

792
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:18,033
If something happens
and I can't make it,

793
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:20,234
you must leave without me.

794
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:32,834
Natalia!

795
01:01:33,868 --> 01:01:34,834
Ah.

796
01:01:53,834 --> 01:01:55,234
Who are those guys?

797
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,200
Get in!

798
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,601
Morning, gents.

799
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,334
Where you heading
on those old plates?

800
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,334
What?

801
01:06:46,334 --> 01:06:48,367
Plates of meat. Feet.

802
01:06:48,367 --> 01:06:50,868
Oh, uh, Carcroft Castle.

803
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:53,167
You don't look like
royalty to me.

804
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,133
Jump on.

805
01:06:55,234 --> 01:06:57,133
Come on.

806
01:06:57,133 --> 01:06:58,701
What's your name?
MacGyver.

807
01:06:58,701 --> 01:07:00,234
Scottish?
Eh...

808
01:07:00,234 --> 01:07:02,033
Just call me Plato.

809
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:03,067
You like music?

810
01:07:03,067 --> 01:07:04,067
Sure.

811
01:07:04,067 --> 01:07:05,834
Good.

812
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:07,334
*I'm ready to rock *

813
01:07:07,334 --> 01:07:08,667
Hold on. Here we go.

814
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,400
Thank you, sir.

815
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,000
Hey Plato, would you
mind stopping?

816
01:07:31,267 --> 01:07:33,200
Can you cut the engines?

817
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,734
And the music?

818
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:39,934
I think that's for me, my friend.

819
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:42,100
Listen, it's a long story.

820
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,300
But I'm innocent.

821
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,801
Now, I don't want to
get you in trouble,

822
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:46,701
but I could use your help here.

823
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:48,234
Us blokes got to stick together.

824
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:50,400
Look like a couple
of ices anyway.

825
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,334
What?
Ice cream freezers.

826
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:54,133
Geezers.
Oh.

827
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:55,400
See you round the other side.

828
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,234
Switch the engine off please, sir.

829
01:08:33,367 --> 01:08:34,434
And the music.

830
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:37,734
We're looking for this man.

831
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:38,868
Have you seen him

832
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:40,901
or anyone that looks like him?
Sorry.

833
01:08:40,901 --> 01:08:42,934
If you do, will you notify
the police immediately?

834
01:08:42,934 --> 01:08:44,400
Yes, officer.
Yeah.

835
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,267
Put your helmet on.
Yes. Yes, sir.

836
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,234
Hello, ladies.

837
01:08:57,234 --> 01:08:58,534
We're looking for this gentleman.

838
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,334
You're a good man, Plato.

839
01:09:37,334 --> 01:09:39,300
You be lucky, MacGyver.

840
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:23,734
So you're all together
there, are you?

841
01:13:50,434 --> 01:13:52,067
Hello? Yes.

842
01:14:05,767 --> 01:14:08,100
I realize that,
but you must understand,

843
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,601
the serum guarantees truth,
not cooperation.

844
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,601
I know.

845
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:15,267
Very well. I'll do my best.

846
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:17,901
Are you ready to begin?

847
01:14:17,901 --> 01:14:19,334
I'm tired.

848
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,000
Elise, don't fight it.

849
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,834
You can't lie with the serum.

850
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:26,467
I'm tired.

851
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:28,067
We need the software code

852
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:30,400
to your father's spectrometer.

853
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,701
What makes it so sensitive?

854
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,801
How can we upgrade ours?

855
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:37,167
I told you everything.

856
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:39,234
You know as much as I do.

857
01:14:39,234 --> 01:14:40,667
I worked with your father

858
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:43,100
for over five years.

859
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,434
And I have access
to almost all his research.

860
01:14:46,434 --> 01:14:50,801
But I know he kept certain
information to himself.

861
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:54,200
Only one who had access
to all the files was you.

862
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,567
I did not see the files

863
01:14:55,567 --> 01:14:56,801
you refer to.

864
01:14:56,801 --> 01:14:58,400
We must have that information

865
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,901
to secure the plant
from further detection.

866
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:04,734
Elise, they will kill you.

867
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,501
Now, don't be foolish, my dear.

868
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:08,601
They'll kill you, you know that.

869
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,467
We've been through this
so many times before.

870
01:15:14,467 --> 01:15:16,934
Elise, I must have an answer.

871
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:18,033
Try the library.

872
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:26,534
MacGyver.

873
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:29,534
My father. Is he...?

874
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,501
I'm sorry.

875
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,367
Elise...

876
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,667
They drugged me.

877
01:15:40,667 --> 01:15:41,634
I woke up here.

878
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:47,767
Who are "they," Elise?

879
01:15:47,767 --> 01:15:49,100
I don't know.

880
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:53,501
I answer questions
about the spectrometer.

881
01:15:53,501 --> 01:15:55,167
They want one...

882
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:56,734
to monitor emissions.

883
01:15:56,734 --> 01:15:59,167
Avoid another detection.

884
01:15:59,167 --> 01:16:02,234
They're processing nuclear
materials in a facility

885
01:16:02,234 --> 01:16:04,033
under the castle.

886
01:16:04,033 --> 01:16:04,200
What?

887
01:16:05,334 --> 01:16:06,434
You must hurry.

888
01:16:06,434 --> 01:16:09,534
I heard them talking.

889
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:12,100
The first shipment leaves today.

890
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,200
Two tactical weapons.

891
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,000
I'm sorry.

892
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,534
I helped them.

893
01:16:17,534 --> 01:16:19,234
I tried not to.
I really tried.

894
01:16:19,234 --> 01:16:20,667
No. It's all right.

895
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:22,200
It's okay, honey.

896
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,133
I'm gonna get you out of here.

897
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,601
I'll be back.

898
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,667
Don't touch that.

899
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:07,667
Please.

900
01:18:10,734 --> 01:18:12,501
I was afraid you'd get this far.

901
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:15,667
Pity, MacGyver.

902
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:18,100
You're just too good
for your own good.

903
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:28,634
It was you all the time.

904
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:30,501
It's kind of hard to believe

905
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:31,701
anybody would be sick enough

906
01:18:31,701 --> 01:18:34,300
to order the death
of his own brother.

907
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:37,200
Difficult decisions are the lot
of the entrepreneur, MacGyver.

908
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,234
Especially with stakes this high.

909
01:18:39,234 --> 01:18:40,734
Yeah, what stakes?

910
01:18:40,734 --> 01:18:42,534
Change is everywhere, my friend.

911
01:18:42,534 --> 01:18:45,901
Yeltsin's democracy
could be the first to fall.

912
01:18:45,901 --> 01:18:47,667
There's a Communist coup
in the works,

913
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:49,067
perhaps from the inside.

914
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:51,834
But as yet, my clients
are organizing themselves

915
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:53,200
from the outside.

916
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,734
Profits will be enormous.

917
01:18:55,734 --> 01:18:58,734
You'd put the whole world
at risk...for profit?

918
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,567
Beautiful.

919
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:04,100
It is indeed beautiful.

920
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,033
I accomplished the impossible.

921
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,801
A state-of-the-art
nuclear facility

922
01:19:07,801 --> 01:19:09,901
right here
in the heart of Britain.

923
01:19:09,901 --> 01:19:12,467
Built...without detection.

924
01:19:12,467 --> 01:19:13,434
Almost.

925
01:19:13,434 --> 01:19:13,868
Paul found it.

926
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,400
Unfortunately.

927
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,634
It took me ten years
to build this plant.

928
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:20,400
Our products will be
used to take control

929
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,801
of Russia's nuclear arsenal,

930
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:26,133
before the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty takes effect.

931
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:29,200
I foresaw the demand,
and now the market is mine.

932
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,334
I am sole broker for nuclear
capability and devices...

933
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:34,868
for the world.

934
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:38,067
Well, what about conscience?

935
01:19:38,067 --> 01:19:39,868
What aboutlaw?

936
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:41,701
This--

937
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:44,901
This is a violation of
the most basic and crucial laws

938
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:47,200
of civilized society.

939
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,501
You're offering
genocide for profit.

940
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:51,033
What are you thinking?

941
01:19:51,033 --> 01:19:52,634
As I see it, MacGyver,

942
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:55,367
the law is simply one of
the risks of doing business.

943
01:19:55,367 --> 01:19:57,901
Well, as I see it, Fred...

944
01:19:57,901 --> 01:20:00,300
you're just one more
cheap crook.

945
01:20:04,868 --> 01:20:05,834
Oh!

946
01:20:19,334 --> 01:20:21,100
Your logic sucks.

947
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:41,167
"Tactical nuclear device."

948
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:52,133
Damn you.

949
01:21:52,133 --> 01:21:54,334
For always succeeding.

950
01:21:54,334 --> 01:21:57,501
For making me the one
to have to kill you.

951
01:21:57,501 --> 01:21:58,501
Well...

952
01:21:58,501 --> 01:21:59,801
I'm real sorry about that.

953
01:21:59,801 --> 01:22:01,701
I didn't want it
to end this way...

954
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:03,167
Oh, knock it off.

955
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:05,834
But certain ends
require drastic means.

956
01:22:05,834 --> 01:22:07,767
Yeah.

957
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:10,400
Ex-KGB my butt.

958
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,534
This is beyond KGB.

959
01:22:12,534 --> 01:22:14,000
Beyond anything.

960
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,868
This is my family, my country,

961
01:22:15,868 --> 01:22:17,567
the future of the Soviet Union.

962
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:20,267
Natalia, there is
no Soviet Union.

963
01:22:20,267 --> 01:22:21,634
No.

964
01:22:21,634 --> 01:22:24,100
I refuse to accept that.

965
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,601
I am a patriot.

966
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:27,367
I will never allow
the dissolution

967
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:29,200
of the KGB or the Soviet.

968
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,000
They stole my country.

969
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,334
I want it back.

970
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:34,434
That world is over.

971
01:22:34,434 --> 01:22:36,067
No, that's lies!
I won't listen.

972
01:22:36,067 --> 01:22:39,701
Your country is in the middle of
a massive transition right now.

973
01:22:39,701 --> 01:22:42,234
Can't you see that what you're
doing is counterproductive?

974
01:22:42,234 --> 01:22:46,367
I have a mission to preserve
the Soviet state.

975
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:47,634
You stand in the way.

976
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:49,367
Will you listen to yourself?

977
01:22:49,367 --> 01:22:51,100
You don't understand.

978
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,934
You could never understand.

979
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:54,934
No one's ever stolen
your government,

980
01:22:54,934 --> 01:22:55,200
discarded your beliefs,

981
01:22:56,467 --> 01:22:58,934
left your people without dignity.

982
01:22:58,934 --> 01:23:00,234
With nothing.

983
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,267
Well...

984
01:23:05,267 --> 01:23:08,300
you seem to have things
well in hand, my dear.

985
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:09,701
So, MacGyver...

986
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:11,901
since you've been good enough
to deliver the evidence

987
01:23:11,901 --> 01:23:13,801
you so cleverly hid
in the sewers,

988
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:16,968
there seems no further reason
to delay your demise.

989
01:23:16,968 --> 01:23:18,534
Shoot him!

990
01:23:18,534 --> 01:23:19,534
Can I say something...

991
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:20,601
before you do?

992
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:24,067
Natalia, y--

993
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:27,367
You realize
you're a phony...

994
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:29,367
and a total hypocrite here.

995
01:23:29,367 --> 01:23:32,767
You don't care about
your people or your beliefs.

996
01:23:32,767 --> 01:23:33,767
You're on the verge of

997
01:23:33,767 --> 01:23:35,200
killing thousands and thousands

998
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,601
of people for
your precious Communism.

999
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:41,067
And your partner
in this...noble scheme...

1000
01:23:41,067 --> 01:23:44,000
is a greed-driven
billionaire capitalist

1001
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
like Freddy boy here.

1002
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:45,601
Shoot him!

1003
01:23:47,267 --> 01:23:48,734
Some Communist.

1004
01:23:48,734 --> 01:23:50,734
I admit there's
a certain hypocrisy

1005
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,567
to that aspect
of the arrangement.

1006
01:23:52,567 --> 01:23:54,400
Just a little.

1007
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,934
But quite honestly, it's been
my intention from the start...

1008
01:23:56,934 --> 01:23:57,767
to correct it.

1009
01:24:43,334 --> 01:24:46,434
Separator temperature
controller inoperative.

1010
01:24:46,434 --> 01:24:49,133
Please restore immediately.

1011
01:24:49,133 --> 01:24:53,400
Separator temperature
controller is inoperative.

1012
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,968
Please restore immediately.

1013
01:24:55,968 --> 01:24:58,634
System will fail in 60 seconds.

1014
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,334
Separator temperature
is increasing.

1015
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:08,334
System will fail in 50 seconds.

1016
01:25:13,634 --> 01:25:15,868
Separator temperature critical.

1017
01:25:15,868 --> 01:25:18,601
System will fail in 40 seconds.

1018
01:25:25,767 --> 01:25:28,167
System failure in 30 seconds.

1019
01:25:32,968 --> 01:25:35,467
System has been disconnected.

1020
01:25:35,467 --> 01:25:36,634
Thank you.

1021
01:26:13,634 --> 01:26:14,267
MacGyver!

1022
01:26:37,167 --> 01:26:38,400
Warning.

1023
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,234
Uranium separator
failure imminent.

1024
01:26:40,234 --> 01:26:41,567
No! Stop!

1025
01:26:41,567 --> 01:26:43,267
I hate you!

1026
01:26:43,267 --> 01:26:44,367
Give it up!

1027
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:46,133
Nuclear systems jeopardized.

1028
01:26:48,434 --> 01:26:50,667
Automatic override engaged.

1029
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:52,634
Nuclear emergency averted.

1030
01:26:55,334 --> 01:26:59,367
Automatic override
has been bypassed.

1031
01:26:59,367 --> 01:27:01,200
System failure imminent.

1032
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,567
All nuclear systems at risk.

1033
01:27:03,567 --> 01:27:05,434
Repeat:

1034
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:08,033
system failure imminent.

1035
01:27:08,033 --> 01:27:10,400
All nuclear systems at risk.

1036
01:27:14,701 --> 01:27:15,767
Ah!

1037
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,033
Nuclear systems operating
beyond design limits.

1038
01:27:22,033 --> 01:27:23,467
Red alert.

1039
01:27:23,467 --> 01:27:25,901
Plant failure imminent.

1040
01:27:25,901 --> 01:27:27,300
Repeat.

1041
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:31,167
Nuclear systems operating
beyond design limits.

1042
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:33,501
Red alert.
Plant failure imminent.

1043
01:27:46,734 --> 01:27:49,133
What have you done?
I've armed the bomb.

1044
01:27:49,133 --> 01:27:51,767
It can't be disarmed
without a trivet wrench.

1045
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:53,934
You lose, MacGyver.

1046
01:27:53,934 --> 01:27:55,267
Now we all die.

1047
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:03,434
Nuclear detonation
in one minute, 30 seconds.

1048
01:28:09,434 --> 01:28:12,868
Nuclear systems operating
beyond design limits.

1049
01:28:12,868 --> 01:28:14,467
Red alert.

1050
01:28:14,467 --> 01:28:16,901
Plant failure imminent.

1051
01:28:16,901 --> 01:28:18,033
Repeat.

1052
01:28:18,033 --> 01:28:20,200
Nuclear systems operating

1053
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,133
beyond design limits.

1054
01:28:22,133 --> 01:28:24,634
Red alert.
Plant failure imminent.

1055
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,901
Nuclear detonation
in one minute.

1056
01:28:40,033 --> 01:28:43,868
Detonation in 50 seconds.

1057
01:28:50,067 --> 01:28:53,701
Detonation in 40 seconds.

1058
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:56,367
Uranium separators destroyed.

1059
01:28:56,367 --> 01:28:58,601
Nuclear facility is inoperative.

1060
01:28:58,601 --> 01:29:01,834
Detonation in 30 seconds.

1061
01:29:04,367 --> 01:29:07,200
Detonation in 25 seconds.

1062
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:13,501
Detonation in 20 seconds.

1063
01:29:15,367 --> 01:29:17,901
Detonation in 15 seconds.

1064
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:22,300
Detonation in ten seconds.

1065
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:25,634
Nine, eight, seven,

1066
01:29:25,634 --> 01:29:28,534
six, five, four,

1067
01:29:28,534 --> 01:29:30,534
three, two...

1068
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:35,300
Nuclear detonation averted.

1069
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,033
Nuclear device disarmed.

1070
01:29:53,801 --> 01:29:55,334
You never give up, do you?

1071
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:58,767
I guess it just wasn't
meant to be.

1072
01:30:10,534 --> 01:30:12,968
I owe you an apology, MacGyver.

1073
01:30:12,968 --> 01:30:15,367
We are on the same side.

1074
01:30:15,367 --> 01:30:16,400
Thanks for your help.

1075
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:19,334
You bet, chief.

1076
01:30:19,334 --> 01:30:21,400
See you soon.
I hope.

1077
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,534
My father cared
so much for this planet.

1078
01:30:45,534 --> 01:30:47,968
He just wanted to do some good.

1079
01:30:47,968 --> 01:30:49,567
He did.

1080
01:30:49,567 --> 01:30:51,634
The world's a safer place
because of Paul.

1081
01:30:51,634 --> 01:30:53,300
Maybe.

1082
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:54,400
But my father,

1083
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,734
your friend, he's gone.

1084
01:30:57,968 --> 01:31:00,534
Then I guess it's up to us.
