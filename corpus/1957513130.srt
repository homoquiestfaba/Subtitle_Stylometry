00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,371
[alarm rings]

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,852
Yes!

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,485
Now...

4
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,907
Oh! There he is!

5
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,910
Morning, buddy!

6
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,620
Oh, you're ready.

7
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,788
Here, I got you some of this.

8
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,373
Mind if
I have breakfast with you?

9
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,917
Here you go.

10
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,836
Whoa! Slow down, tiger!
Slow down! What's the rush?

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,588
Can't.
Fundraiser's ending today.

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,923
Last day already?

13
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,467
That's for
Principal Richards, yeah?

14
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,760
That was last week.

15
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,595
This is for new books, gym gear,

16
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,847
better lunches,
pretty much everything.

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,265
Oh, wow.

18
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,975
Robin, I'm really
proud of you

19
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,311
for trying to make
your school a better place.

20
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,606
You know, as a CPA...

21
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,526
before my firm went under,
I just...

22
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,570
look, I just don't want you
to be shocked

23
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,322
if the money doesn't go
where you want it to go.

24
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,616
Yeah, but this is different.

25
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,953
-Why is that?
-Because it's me.

26
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,746
All right,
whatever you say, kid.

27
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,958
Oh, hey, my second job has
me working nights this week.

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,461
So I need you to come home
straight after school.

29
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,590
Go out and
party all night? Gotcha.

30
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,676
Very funny, mister.

31
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,886
No, I need you home safe and
sound before I head to work.

32
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,682
What if I get attacked
by giant nuclear lizards

33
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,310
or aliens land and try
to take over the city?

34
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,062
Wow, that is a...

35
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,981
that's actually
a really good point.

36
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,774
Well, in that case,
then you call me.

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,818
Calling me and telling me
you're in trouble

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,319
is way better than me
calling you

39
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,113
and discovering that you're
in trouble, got it?

40
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,949
Fine. I'll be back the second
the last bell rings.

41
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,325
Excellent.

42
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,537
I got your favorite TV dinners,
the ones with the brownies!

43
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,372
Cool! Thanks, Dad!

44
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,832
Of course.

45
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,333
See you later!

46
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,710
Hey!

47
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,337
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You forgetting something?

48
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,299
Oh, come on, come on!

49
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,009
But that's not what
I'm talking about, huh?

50
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,512
Oh, man, what kind of
books you got in here?

51
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,055
Just important ones.

52
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,140
Yeah? All right.

53
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,850
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

54
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,937
Hey, remember, right
after school, okay?

55
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,105
Got it.

56
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,982
Don't go fishing!
Come straight home!

57
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,426
Hey, Joe.
Good to see you again!

58
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,552
Hey, my friend!
How are you?

59
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,929
I got you a sandwich.

60
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,640
Oh, no, no, Robin.

61
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,767
I couldn't take it.

62
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,393
I'll just grab something
at school, Joe.

63
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,479
It's a BLT, your favorite.

64
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,773
Don't mention it, Joe.

65
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,733
Everyone needs
a little help sometimes.

66
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,069
Thanks, kid.

67
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,654
You're welcome.

68
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,699
Have a great day!

69
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,582
Mmm.

70
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,880
Okay, John, it's the last day
of the school fundraiser.

71
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,674
Let's prove to Robin we can
raise the money by ourselves.

72
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:23,054
Let's do it for
Principal Richards!

73
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,514
-We have to watch out for Wolfe!
-Git!

74
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,848
Git on, git!

75
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,267
You mean the worst security
guard ever!

76
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,061
Okay, people, it's time to open
your hearts

77
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,562
and your piggy banks!

78
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,439
My friend John would love to
take your money!

79
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,691
For a good cause!

80
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,780
Every penny will go
to helping us!

81
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,282
Don't you guys want
a better school?

82
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm running out of ideas.

83
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,456
Cake every day?

84
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,625
We need Robin.

85
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,630
You're late.
We've got everything set up.

86
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,966
We would've started,
but no one would listen.

87
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,050
Follow my lead.

88
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,177
Just do it fast!

89
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,554
Vice Principal Prince
will be here soon.

90
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,723
May I have your
attention, please?

91
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,851
I need everyone over
by this side.

92
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,352
I've got something you
won't want to miss.

93
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,104
[laughing]

94
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,149
Sadly, our fundraiser
is coming to a close.

95
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,445
We hoped to raise another $100
to make sure we can get books,

96
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,738
better lunches...

97
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,822
and we only have a
short time to do it

98
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,158
before VP Prince
shuts us down!

99
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,868
We've got to take
care of our school

100
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,745
while Principal Richards
is out sick!

101
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,415
But what if we had something
to enjoy right now?

102
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,335
I think if we raise, say, $200,

103
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:40,214
we can see our favorite teacher,
Ms. Tuck, get pied in the face!

104
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,716
I'd like to see that!

105
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,011
John, show 'em what's
behind the curtain!

106
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,221
[cheering]

107
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,642
Hello, students!

108
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,019
[laughing]

109
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,778
Pie! Pie!

110
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,533
Thank you, thanks.
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,620
Appreciate it.

112
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,296
Thank you!

113
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,175
Oh! That was close!

114
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,261
[laughing]

115
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,725
Thank you, thanks.
Thank you very much.

[honks]

120
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,732
Get rid of that sign!

121
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,778
Prince Only!
Get rid of the fine.

122
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,947
-You got it.
-Ridiculous.

123
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,368
-Get rid of that curb!
-Of course!

124
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,744
Where's my briefcase?

125
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,873
Oh, you could do
better than that!

126
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,208
Oh! That was close!

127
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,883
Hi, Johnston!

128
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,801
Yes, I'm picking up
the funds now.

129
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,804
All right.
All right, I'll see you at noon.

130
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,269
Who else got one?

131
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,937
You got a pie?

132
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,650
Oh, come on!

133
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,319
I skipped breakfast for this!

134
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,285
He's coming!

135
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,748
Here, let me get this done
before Prince shuts us down.

136
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,833
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

137
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,923
Move, the great me is coming.

138
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,353

00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,941

[shouting]

141
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,552
Tuck!

142
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,888
Will you get yourself cleaned up
before you go back to class?

143
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,890
You look like a fool!

144
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,727
Come on!
Let's get you cleaned up!

145
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,104
Not one step!

146
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,691
I'm calling everyone
of your parents!

147
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,360
Well, at least
we reached our goal?

148
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,862
I can't wait for Principal
Richards to be back.

149
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,573
I would have thrown
a curve ball.

150
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,408
No, a curve pie?

151
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,243
Either way would have
gone right around him.

152
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:42,498
I threw it perfectly, at least
until Prince got in the way.

153
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,959
I did! Where's instant replay
when you need it?

154
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,257
Move it! Get going!

155
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,009
Walk it off!

156
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,053
No running!

157
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,015

Whoa!
Is that our volcano?

160
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,244
Oh, I didn't know you
guys worked on it.

161
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,787
We're going to do
the presentation!

162
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,456
I've got my sound effects ready!

163

164
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,837
They're amazing!

165
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,465
All right, settle down, class!

166
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,549
Shh, shh, shh.

167
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,056
We have a lot to do today and
not a lot of time to do it.

168
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,557
Now before presentations,

169
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,934
we're going to test
the viscosity of liquids

170
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:49,065
with the many marbles
of my prized collection.

171
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,109
But first, how
to make kid-friendly

[P.A. system feedback]

174
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,658
Good morning. This is Vice
Principal Prince speaking.

175
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,909
How are you?

176
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,203
Awww...

177
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,455
I'm fine, thank you.

178
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,248
I have tallied up
the total raised

179
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,625
by the 5th grade fundraiser.

180
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:13,005
And it comes to as
very unimpressive $653,

181
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,507
all of which will go

182
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:20,012
to Principal Richards's
medical expenses.

183
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,266
We wish him well.

184
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,644
Oh, FYI, until he returns,

185
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,356
I've been authorized to be
the acting principal.

186
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,066
Yuck...

187
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,527
Do you hear me?

188
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,528
Acting!

189
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,238
Principal!

190
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,825
Oh, that's amazing!
Is that true?

191
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,412
No, but they don't know that.

192
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,415
[laughing]

193
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,298
That's good.

194
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,175
Stop it!

195
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,720
Ms. Tuck, Mr. Richards
told us last week

196
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,888
that we had already
raised all the money needed

197
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,265
for his medical bills.

198
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,767
It is a role I humbly accept,

199
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,895
along with my campaign
for School Board President.

200
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,231
Remember, kids,
tell your parents,

201
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:16,110
"For Your Student Kingdom,
elect a real Prince."

202
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,072
Ms. Tuck, he stole
our fundraiser money!

203
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,075
Robin, you're gonna
need a lot of evidence

204
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,577
for an accusation like that.

205
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,996
Today we're starting
a new program

206
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,500
called "Open Concept Learning".

207
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,794
Wolfe, grab everything.

208
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,962
Everything?

209
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,213
Everything!

210
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,799
When you say
everything, you mean...

211
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,760
Yes, everything.

212
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,178
Everything.
All right.

213
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,846
Well, all right, let's do...

214
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,931
Not me, you idiot!

215
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,558
-Out there!
-Okay!

216
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,602
-Well...
-Stop it!

217
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,811
Get out!

218
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,605
Out there, not in here!

219
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,774
Outside!

220
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,446
[feedback]

221
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,073
That concludes
today's announcements.

222
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,117
Do not intervene!

223
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,036
Intervene? That's just...

224
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,416
We'll be taking books,
we'll be taking desks.

225
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,709
What is the meaning of this?

226
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:18,964
We'll be taking anything
not nailed down

227
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:23,302
to allow students to learn in
a free-range environment.

228
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,137
Thank you for your cooperation.

230
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,063
Wait, you can't take my desk!

231
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,106
My marbles...

232
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,821
Wait!

233
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,406
No, no, no, no, no!

234
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,078
I'm scheduled to be here
for eight hours.

235
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,246
You got that kind of time?

236
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,748
All right, hand it all over.

237
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,874
No!

238
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,501
What about the chili?

239
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,794
That, too.

240
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,131
That's my life's work!
It's all I have!

241
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,508
It's boss's orders!

242
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,176
No!

243
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,679
-All right, all right!
-It completes me!

245
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,768
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop!

246
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,854
You can't do this! Stop!

247
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,358
No, no, no, no.
You've gotta get through me!

248
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,111
John, it's fine.

249
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,407
It's not worth you getting
into trouble.

250
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,158
Just let him through.

251
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,044
[kids clamoring]

252
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,629
-No!
-No!

00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,089
-Stop!
-Stop!

254
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,093
I'm sorry, excuse me!

255
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,803
Don't touch the children!

256
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,311
Stop! That's mine!
Give it!

257
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,648
Okay, just talk to
vice principal...

Cut your tomatoes
and get outta here!

261
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,949
I'm taking this with me!

262
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,451
No! Leave the chili!

263
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,913
All right, okay, hand it over,
hand over the chili!

264
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,665
All right, okay.

265
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,584
All right.

266
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,587
Oh, wow.

267
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,425
I'll miss you, Bernice!

268
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,679
Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot!

269
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,984
Kids, I'm so sorry!

270
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,819
Oh!

271
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:53,285
One, two, three...

272
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,373
Enough!

273
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,166
Hey, give it back!

274
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,793
Give it back!

275
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:08,175
All right, let's gather
round on the floor

276
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,470
for now and...

277
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,722
Just right here.
It's fine.

278
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,226
Just make a circle,
we'll just gather round for now.

279
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,145
Yes, it's great.

280
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,232
Turn your books to page 42.

281
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,150
We don't have our books.

282
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,819
Oh, right.

283
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,570
Maybe I can pull the
book up on my phone

284
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,782
and we could
just pass it around.

285
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,244
How are we supposed to learn
under all these conditions?

286
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,996
Mmm...

287
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,288
Ms. Tuck?

288
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,834
This is bad.

289
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,379
This is exactly what our money
was supposed to go towards!

290
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,506
I'm sure once you
find Prince

291
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,758
and you tell him where
the money was supposed to go,

292
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,176
he'll fix it.

293
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,511
Oh, wait.

294
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,138
All of the hall passes
were in my desk.

295
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,515
So you're just gonna have
wait until lunch to go find him.

296
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,183
One last thing, students.

297
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,852
I know you've all been
complaining about how bad

298
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,395
the lunch is here, so I have
some good news!

299
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,855
Now you can all get real
burgers, fries

300
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:09,528
and whatever else
your heart desires!

301
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,156
Yay!

302
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,033
I got rid of our entire lunch
program and worked out a deal

303
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,242
with the fine folks at the
mall food court down the road.

304
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,994
What?

305
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:24,460
Tell them Princey sent you,
and get 3% off. Vote Prince!

306
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,380
In other words,
I'm canceling lunch!

307
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,565
He can't cancel lunch!

308
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,650
I need lunch!
I'm a growing boy!

309
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,943
I can't afford mall food!

310
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,403
We have to do something!

311
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,748
[buzzer sounds]

312
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,424
We have to get
those desks back!

313
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,927
My legs are killing me!

314
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,316
He's up to something.

315
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,568
We can't let him see us
or we'll be in big trouble.

316
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,115
I'll be lookout.
Again...

317
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,616
Thank you.

318
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,828
I'll use my special call
if there's trouble.

320
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,214
What was that?

322

323
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,820
That's our fundraiser money!

325
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,742
Hide!

326
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,299
Johnston!
Good to see you.

327
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,467
-You as well.
-Have a seat.

328
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,430
Now...

329
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,017
Fundraisers...
it's from the kids.

330
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,643
It's only $653.

331
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,478
So it's just a little bonus.

332
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,939
He's giving our money away!

333
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,066
We have to get in there.

334
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,194
No! We need evidence!

335
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,488
What are you doing?

336
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,865
Robin, don't!

337
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,369
-He'll see it!
-No, he won't!

338
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,871
It went under his chair!

339
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,207
Doesn't she have a kid going
to art school next year?

340
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,499
Well, that can't be cheap.

341
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,542
Nice shot!

342
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,419
Maria, I'm Robin Hoode!

343
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,386
Okay, look! I don't care
what your excuse is!

344
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:26,058
But you need a hall pass or
it's an automatic suspension!

345
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,394
Okay, but what about
Principal Richards?

346
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,063
Do we have to worry about him?

347
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,398
Well, not if you
elect me School Board President

348
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,108
tomorrow at three p.m.

349
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,612
'Cause if you don't,
come Monday, Richards is back.

350
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,950
That'll be it.

351
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,494
Well, we can't
have that, can we?

352
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,829
No.

353
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,166
Hey! Aren't you supposed
to be at lunch right now?

354
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,252
Don't you know
you need nutrition

355
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,836
for your growing brains?

356
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,880
You know, I eat
all the time

357
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,133
which is why my brains
is bigger than your brains!

358
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,260
Yeah, uh...

359
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,095
[squawks]

360
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,606
That a bobcat in the hallway?

361
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,610
That sounds sick.

362
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,992
Guys, come on!
Wolfe's on the way!

363
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,870
Next time if you
hear me scream, hide!

364
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,458
What is it, Wolfe?

365
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,085
I thought now might
be a good time

366
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,962
to talk about that
super secret plan--

367
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,297
Shh!

368
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,091
Let's go somewhere where
we can talk more privately.

369
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,261
Oh, like the super secret
executive lounge--

370
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,221
Whoa!

371
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,518
What'd you see?

372
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,478
Nothing.

373
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,814
But...
We just saw them go in there.

374
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,774
Either of you know
how to pick a lock?

375
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,778
Hmm...

376
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,159
What do you think?

377
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,747
That was a very impressive
super secret executive lounge.

378
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,457
The candles were
a very nice touch.

379
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,250
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

380
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,003
Yeah, you really are
quite a class act.

381
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,714
Have you tried these
in the super secret entrance

382
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,923
through the library?

383
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,218
'Cause that thing is awesome!

384
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,516
Looking forward to seeing
you Saturday. Three p.m. sharp.

385
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,185
I look forward to it as well.

386
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:38,523
So, uh...
what you got going on now?

387
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,359
You wanna do anything?

388
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,693
Get a sandwich or something?

389
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,528
Just go do whatever
it is you do.

390
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,781
All right.
Aye-aye, captain!

391
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,910
Hey! No running in the hallway!
That is a felony!

392
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,061
[bell rings]

393
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,440
Prince's office
is always locked.

394
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,942
We can never get in.

395
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,693
Wolfe said something about
a super secret entrance

396
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,861
inside the library.

397
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,154
I need to get my phone back!

398
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,615
It has evidence of
Prince using our money!

399
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,742
Meet me in the parking
lot after school.

400
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,994
Bring the volcano.

401
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,128
Okay. Everybody know the plan?

402
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,712
Break.

403
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,507
Wait for my signal.

404
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,800
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,760
Don't call me ma'am.
I'm 10.

406
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,179
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mm-kay.

407
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,769
Oh, hey, Mr. Prince.
Can I talk to you?

408
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,522
Acting Principal Prince!

409
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,524
I was just wondering why,
you know, you have to cut

410
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,860
so much of the budget when
we've done so much fundraising?

411
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,903
Good question,
but it's not budget cuts.

412
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,322
It's "Open Concept Learning".

413
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,740
I'm trying to foster...

414
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,037
You're one of Ms. Tuck's
fundraising kids, aren't you?

415
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,622
Guilty!

416
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,916
Lots of things that
go into a budget

417
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,003
that you would never understand.

418
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,381
Because you're 10
and I'm an adult.

419
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,678
Now, If you'll excuse me...

420
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,723
Acting Principal Prince, wait!

421
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,057
Wait for what?

422
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,480
Wait here!
Wait, please! Just wait!

423
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,940
No! I'm going to my car!

424
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,030
Have a nice day, dear.

425
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,531
I hope you don't.

426
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,742
I'll see you tomorrow.

427
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,912
[crunching]

428
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,291
[rumbling]

429
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,459
No!

430
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,170
Our volcano!

431
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,297
-Are you kidding me?
-How dare you?

432
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,050
How dare I what?

433
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,011
Why would you leave
this behind my car?

434
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,234
You've ruined our volcano!

435
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,694
It fell out of my backpack!
I...

436
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:34,449
It's my car, not yours!
Why are you crying about it?

437
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,326
It's $5,000.

438
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,328
I hope your parents
have insurance!

439
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,248
This is gonna be at least
three weeks in the shop

440
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,874
[sobbing]

441
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,876
Stop crying, relax!

442
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,546
Calm down!

443
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,547
I'll make sure you get a "C"!

444
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,382
Um... 3, 2, 1...

445
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,467
He said it fell out
of his backpack!

446
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,469
Excuse me?

447
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,556
You kids are a bunch of zeroes.

448
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,141
Zero, zero, zero.

449
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,562
Hey, Mr. Prince!
We need to get going!

450
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,272
Yes!

451
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,025
You have to tell Ms. Tuck we're
getting an extension or else!

452
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:13,780
What? You can always
build another volcano!

453
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,824
You're gonna get detention.

454
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,159
Oh, no! What did you
do to our volcano?

455
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,828
Me?

456
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,121
Come on, guys.

457
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,455
And don't worry, sir.

458
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,457
Ms. Tuck will understand
this is your fault.

459
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,876
My fault?
It slipped out of his backpack!

460
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,962
It's all your fault!

461
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,047
Your fault!
You heard it!

462
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,841
It's all your fault!

463
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,467
Stop!

464
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,192
Know this...

465
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,446
I have had my eyes
on the three of you

466
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,240
from the beginning
of the year.

467
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,619
Ever since you filled that
classroom up with soap suds...

468
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,829
Had to get those floors clean.

469
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,624
And the room full of marbles?

470
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,834
We needed something
that could easily be grouped

471
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,127
into ones and tens.

472
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,795
Common core, 'ya know.

473
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,715
Oh, tell me about it...
enough!

474
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,134
Now I know where you live and
I know where your parents work!

475
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:20,305
You're walking a very thin line.
Do you understand?

476
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:25,644
Principal Richards may have
liked you, but I don't!

477
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:44,996
Darn it, the audio is bad.
You can't make anything out.

478
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,333
My volcano was
ruined for nothing?

479
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,585
Come on. We raised so much
to save our school!

480
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,755
Now we need to save
it a different way...

481
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,173
By stopping Prince.

482
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,635
[sighing]

483
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,597
But how do we do that?

484
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,474
We come to school tomorrow.

485
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,059
On a Saturday?

486
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,436
Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

487
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,897
I know, but nobody
will be around.

488
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,858
We get in, get into
Prince's office,

489
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,360
find the money as evidence

490
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,196
and use that to stop him
from getting elected.

491
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,657
We just need to
stop him before the election

492
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,867
at three p.m. tomorrow.

493
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,536
Wait. What time is it?

494
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,037
Almost four.

495
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,041
Robin?

496
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,501
See you tomorrow?

497
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,211
Yep, tomorrow!

498
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,297
Uh, okay.

499
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,302
At least the color's still nice.

500
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,179
Thanks. The flies like it too.

501
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,873
Where were you?

502
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,999
Sorry, dad, I...

503
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:15,170
Uh-uh. No, no.
No excuses.

504
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,922
Did I not say you to
come home right after school?

505
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,215
You did, but there...

506
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,800
And it is not
not right after school?

507
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,177
No, it's not.

508
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,720
Okay, so here's
what's gonna happen.

509
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,346
I'm now late for work,

510
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,849
which means you're
in some big trouble.

511
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,143
But there's this guy who
stole all the fundraiser money.

512
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,145
Yeah, what did I
say about excuses?

513
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,317
Robin, you're grounded.

514
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,777
What?

515
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,944
Go to your room,
go to your room.

516
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,488
You can't do that!

517
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,322
You're gonna be in there
for the weekend, all right?

518
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,282
-But--
-Hey, listen.

519
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,658
You keep it up, you're
gonna be there the whole year.

520
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,411
I have to go to work.
Be back after midnight.

521
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,663
Just be in there
when I get back.

522
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,123
Okay.

523
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,793
Go.

524
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,976
Maria?

525
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,019
Robin? What's wrong?

526
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,771
I got grounded.

527
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,524
But it's up to us to
save the school! We need you!

528
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,691
I know.

529
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,692
I lost track of time.

530
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,735
What about tomorrow?

531
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,153
Tomorrow?

532
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,238
Or else Prince will
win the election

533
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,656
and we'll never stop him!

534
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,241
Robin, I know your Dad
would understand.

535
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,909
Are we really gonna call
this off?

536
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,119
No, the plan's still on.

537
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,705
But I'll need your help
breaking me out of here.

538
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,290
We have a school to save.

539
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,007
[alarm rings]

540
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,676

Um, can Robin come out
and play today?

I'm afraid not.
He is very grounded.

Bye.

All right, so he's grounded
the whole weekend.

720
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,121
Not unless we can prove that
this is our fundraiser money.

721
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,039
Let's see what else we can find.

722
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,504
I thought you said
the election was at one?

723
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,592
Oh, did I?
My mistake. It's at three.

724
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,428
But now that you're here,
I'd love to talk about it.

725
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,762
I don't know.

726
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,931
You're running for President
of the School Board.

727
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,475
That just seems icky.

728
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,729
Well, why don't we
talk about it over lunch,

729
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,106
say, McAllister's Prime Rib?

730
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,108
-Hmm...
-My treat.

731
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,235
Oh, in that case, all right.

732
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,947
[whispers]
Yes!

733
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,200
Oh, well, well, well!

734
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,077
Good to see you there, punk!

735
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,622
Hey, Wolfe, you hungry?

736
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,998
I mean, I can always eat.

737
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,458
Then eat this!

738
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,882
[shouting]

739
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,348
Ha!

740
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,269
I'll go find John,
hopefully he lost them!

741
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,687
I'll be right behind you.

742
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,899
I just need to check
something out real quick.

743
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,490
Whoa!

744
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,575
Come on, John,
in here!

745
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,997
Robin! Where'd you go?

746
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,998
Robin, you can't just
leave us like that!

747
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,583
We could have used your help!

748
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,586
I know, and I'm sorry.
But you guys gotta see this!

749
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,382
Whoa...

750
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,592
Just wait 'til you see
the next room.

751
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,848
Welcome to the new
executive lounge!

752
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,892
Whoa!

753
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,769
What is this place?

754
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,563
I dunno, but it's time to party!

755
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,266
Let's go look for that
fundraiser money.

756
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,017
I'll check Prince's office.

757
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,943
I actually know a great dry
cleaner that can get out chili.

758
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:41,280
He's right next to
Ramichi's House of Waffles.

759
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,615
Well, that's pretty good.
Down on 4th Street.

760
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,616
Someone's coming.

761
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,160
Maria, go jam the door!

762
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,460
Looks like they found
the super secret lounge!

763
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,589
Nah, it's jammed!

764
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,886
I jammed the door,

765
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,554
but it's not gonna hold 'em
off for that long!

766
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,347
I have an idea!

767
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,808
Here we go!

768
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:13,604
Here we--
[grunts]

769
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,939
Oh, my...

770
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,485
Okay, here...

771
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,653
Okay, there's something
wrong with this door!

772
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,738
It should pop right--

773
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,492
You guys wanna help
me with this?

774
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,118
No?

775
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,663
All right, fine!
Here we go!

776
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,626
[slowed down shouting]

777
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,673
Ah!

778
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:45,928
Okay, I'm fine.
Go on without me!

779
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,304
Okay...

780
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,394
-Come on, kids!
-You come on out!

781
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,480
-Three...
-It's time!

782
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,148
Two...

783
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,191
Give it up!

784
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,777
-One!
-One!

785
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,821
All right...

786
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,073
[shouting]

787
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,389
Cover me!

788
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,849
Why do I have to stay behind?

789
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,308
Because Robin said so.

790
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,409
Oh, no!
All the balls are gone!

791
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,588
We got him!

792
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,466
Don't worry.

793
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,552
Your friends will be
joining you soon enough.

794
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,889
Oh, congratulations.
You defeated a kid.

795
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,182
A real annoying kid, too!

796
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,693
They don't just give
these to anyone!

797
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,032
Okay, that hurts.

798
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,617
You and Snake go.

799
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,119
I'll make sure this one
doesn't get up to anything.

800
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,021
I don't think John can
hold them off for that long.

801
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,565
We have to find a way
into Prince's office!

802
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,820
They're probably in here!

803
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,864
You hear that?
Someone's coming!

804
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,949
Hide!

805
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,785
Whoa!
Ha!

806
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,453
Aww.

807
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,288
I would have thought
I would have at least

808
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,915
scared one of them!

809
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,878
Ha!

810
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,713
See? Nothing!

811
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,425
There's literally no one here!

812
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,388
Take a look at this office here.

813
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,056
Oh, no, not that office!

814
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:40,435
That office only has one key
and I'm the only one who has it!

815
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,813
Got it right here.

816
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,482
He calls me sometimes
in the morning and says,

817
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,526
"Hey, can you use your
keys to let me in?"

818
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,654
I go, "I don't have to be
in for another two hours!"

819
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,157
You know, it's the worst job!

820
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,534
It's rude.

821
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,496
It's... I've tried...
anyway, come on.

822
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,581
Let's go.
Let's go find 'em.

823
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,000
Come on!

824
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,501
No time to waste!

825
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,296
Let's get inside!
Come on!

826
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,015
It's not working.

827
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,683
Watch an expert do it.

828
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,854
You're welcome.

829
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,314
Let's find that money
and save our school!

830
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,487
All right, the money
has to be in here.

831
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,739
Look for someplace secure.

832
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,242
Somewhere only
Prince could get to.

833
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,329
Well, this is a place to start.

834
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,456
PRINCE: Yes, I was thinking
that same thing.

835
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,874
Someone's coming! Hide!

836
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,257
You know, Mrs. Cross,
I am so happy you decided

837
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,926
to vote Prince for
School Board President.

838
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,846
You'll be able to send your
kid to art school for life.

839
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,931
Please, no.

840
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,683
[laughing]

841
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,855
Let me get you those funds.

842
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,860
No looking.

843
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,329
I still don't know, Prince.

844
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,749
Well, just think of
it as a gift.

845
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:30,462
If you decide not to vote
for me, you keep it anyway.

846
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,381
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely!

847
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,094
Come on. I'll show you where
we're gonna build the new gym.

848
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,474
That was too close!

849
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:45,602
Do you know how
to break into a safe?

850
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,938
If we use the chemicals
from our volcano project,

851
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,107
set them off against
the safe's mechanism,

852
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:53,026
and force of the reaction
causes the safe to break,

853
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,111
which would open it!

854
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,445
Let's try.

855
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,367
Now I just left Cross
at the gym.

856
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,285
Here are the keys to
Ms. Tuck's room.

857
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,830
Get baking soda, vinegar...

858
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,915
Go! I'll figure it out,
and good luck.

859
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,255
Cross at the gym.

860
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,841
Now the next thing
we need to do--

861
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,092
Bye!

862
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,969
What? Get her!

863
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,648
She went that way!

864
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,526
Search all the rooms!
She could be anywhere!

865
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,694
She can't be that far.

866
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,445
Maybe she turned invisible!

867
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,489
I wouldn't put anything
past these kids!

868
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,616
Shut up and search the rooms!

869
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:14,065
Can't have an explosion
without a volcano.

870
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,031
Hey! TP Prince!
Over here!

871
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,537
Wolfe, you go that way!

872
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,589
Hey, guys!
Come and get me!

873
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,974
Why are you doing this?

874
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,560
You took our desks
and canceled lunch!

875
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,938
So what?
You didn't need 'em.

876
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,148
Maybe, but you're
still pretty bad.

877
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,274
Hey!

878
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,443
Look, boss!
I got her!

879
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,903
Get off of me!

880
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:04,616
I came around from
the side, boss! I got her!

881
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,576
Take her to the other room
with the other kids.

882
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:10,288
Oh, I will.
Oh, I'm doing it, all right!

883
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,998
Here we go!

884
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:15,877
Help.

885
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:29,808
Ow!

886
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,142
I'd better stay with Croc.

887
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,019
Make sure these brats
don't escape.

888
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,021
Sounds good to me!

889
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,857
Let us out of here!
We have rights!

890
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,651
[speaks foreign language]

891
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,611
Not in there...
[speaks foreign language]

892
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,959
-Hey.
-Hey.

893
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,713
At least Robin's
still out there.

894
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,590
Yeah. That's what
I'm afraid of.

895
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,854
Okay, science,
let's see what happens.

896
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,859
Before you know it, I will
be School Board President

897
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,902
and Principal Richards
will be history.

898
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,489
[chuckles]

899
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,283
What are you doing here?

900
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,826
You can't go through with this!

901
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,620
Oh, I can and I will.

902
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,956
I won't let you.
I'll set off my volcano!

903
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,043
Ooh, a volcano.
So scary.

904
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,712
This isn't a regular volcano.

905
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,672
Oh, really?
What is it?

906
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,549
Your worst nightmare.

907
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,848
Hey!

908
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,186
[explosion]

909
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,735
The election is starting
in 10 minutes.

910
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,528
We have to get out of here
and stop it.

911
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,280
But we're stuck.

912
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,449
What would Robin do?

913
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,034
Besides leave me behind?

914
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,911
He only does that
because he trusts you.

915
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,246
No. It's because I'm a star
athlete at the school.

916
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,665
Either way, feeling sorry
for yourself

917
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:22,796
is not going to help us.

918
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,297
What would Robin do?

919
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,717
Wolfe! Get in here?

920
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,677
I can't find my phone!

921
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,678
Wolfe!

922
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,556
Yay! Foam party! Nice.

923
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,017
So what's going on in here?

924
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,978
That brat set off
an actual volcano!

925
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,189
Now we have 10 minutes to get
to the School Board election.

926
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,649
So...

927
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,527
Where did you get an ice cream?

928
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,654
I always have ice cream.

929
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,074
All right, get the safe to the
gym and help me find my phone!

930
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:54,285
The whole safe?
That seems a little impractical.

931
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:58,415
You're impractical!
Hurry up!

932
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,083
Quit playing with the foam!

933
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:06,256
Now get that safe to the gym
and find my phone and hurry up!

934
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,674
Put a little on top.

935
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,471
[knocking]

936
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,265
Knock, knock,
can I come in?

937
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,936
Okay, hey, I know
you're mad at me and I get it.

938
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:25,191
But I have here your
favorite PB&J

939
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,696
cut diagonally just the way
you like it, with chips, huh?

940
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,784
Robin, you interested?

941
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:46,212
Look, kiddo, I'm really
sorry I got so mad at you,

942
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:50,300
It's just...
I worry, you know.

943
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,971
I was a lot like you in school.

944
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,931
You know, I had big dreams,
a big personality.

945
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:00,435
It's just... school dragged
everything out of me.

946
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,978
Every time something
good would happen,

947
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,564
something bad would happen.

948
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,816
I didn't want to get
your hopes up because

949
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,278
I know how quickly things
can come crashing down.

950
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,073
But I've come to realize that
I shouldn't rob you

951
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,994
of your hope and optimism
based off my experience.

952
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,164
Because that might not be yours.

953
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,834
You should be allowed
to believe in whatever it is

954
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,170
you want to believe in.

955
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,880
And if it happens to be
this school

956
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,424
and your fundraising
can help rescue it,

957
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:35,970
then who am I to take that
away from you, right, son?

958
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,893
Son?
Right, son?

959
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:44,020
Son, hey...

960
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:57,367
Robin!

961
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,494
PRINCE: Ladies and gentlemen of
the school board committee,

962
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,538
please make your way down
to the auditorium

963
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:07,335
and get ready to vote for your
new school board president.

964
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,912
Robin?

965
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,081
Hey, come out!
Oh, man!

966
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,041
You're gonna be
so grounded, man!

967
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,471
Hmm.

968
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,224
Hmm, just in time.

969
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,768
Soon nobody will be able
to stop me from

970
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,438
taking over this school...

971
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,940
and the district.

972
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,611
[laughing]

973
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,994
Stop it!

974
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,331
Come on!
Set me down.

975
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,835
It's too small to fit
into anyway.

976
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,963
Prince is President.

977
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,798
We have to get outta here,
but we're stuck.

978
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,133
Do you have any ideas?

979
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,468
You're the idea person anyway.

980
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,803
Why do I always have to
be the idea person?

981
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,305
It's always, "Maria,
could you build the volcano,

982
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,890
I'll give the presentation?"

983
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,184
Then it's "Could you just give
the presentation, too?

984
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,478
You know volcanos so
much better than we do."

985
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,979
It's so annoying.

986
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,190
At least you're valued
for your brain.

987
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,609
People look at me and think,
"Hey, he's strong and fast.

988
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,611
He can do all the strong
and fast things."

989
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,154
I got other skills.

990
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,157
I'm taking Algebra 2
at the high school first period

991
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,076
on Tuesdays and Thursdays!

992
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,869
Oh, I had no idea.

993
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,496
You never asked.

994
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,873
That's why you're always late?

995
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,584
Not that that matters,
now that we won't have a school.

996
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,215
But, like,
do you have any ideas?

997
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,008
No.

998
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,020
And here he is, Prince!

999
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,440
Thank you, Don Pardo.

1000
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,445
Right.

1001
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,532
Is that thing on?

1002
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,242
What?

1003
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,411
No.

1004
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,371
I mean, it's supposed to be.

1005
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,708
We'll just say there is
something wrong with the upload.

1006
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,209
Fine, but where's the money?

1007
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,378
Right there in my safe.

1008
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:58,548
Give me a second,
I've got to get the...

1009
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,135
Okay, all right.
We're good.

1010
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,220
It's a little heavier--

1011
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,642
I got it!
Gonna be fine.

1012
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,561
[groaning]

1013
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,776
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you know,

1014
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,612
I've already advanced you $653.

1015
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,116
But I am in a particularly
generous mood today.

1016
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,078
So after I am voted
School Board President,

1017
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:34,709
you'll each receive
an additional $5,000.

1018
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,101
I just need to see
what's inside the safe.

1019
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:57,732
I thought we agreed to $100,000?

1020
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,108
Well, yes, it'll be $100,000

1021
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,277
after we pilfer
the other school districts.

1022
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,823
Did you find the last one?

1023
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,617
Uh, the last one what?

1024
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,577
Shh! The kid!

1025
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,163
Oh, yeah... no.

1026
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,998
Well, go find him!

1027
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,041
Okay.

1028
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,876
Let's start the election.

1029
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:20,129
The 113th Nottingham
District School Board Meeting

1030
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,048
is now in session.

1031
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,470
[humming]

1032
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:29,806
[police sirens sound]

1033
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,560
Hey, the police are here!

1034
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,978
Good.

1035
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,355
You hear that, kids?

1036
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:40,024
You'll be in
a different cell soon.

1037
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,610
[laughing]

1038
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,611
Oh, no.

1039
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,366
Wait.

1040
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,955
Hey. Hey!

1041
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,498
It's not that funny.

1042
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,668
All right.

1043
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,462
All those in favor of
making Prince

1044
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,465
the President of the School
Board, say "Aye".

1045
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,343
Aye.

1046
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:09,262
Cross, how do you vote?

1047
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,306
Think about it, Cross.

1048
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:18,062
McAllister's Prime Rib
every single night.

1049
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,897
Aye.

1050
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,525
Well, congratulations,
School Board President Prince.

1051
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:25,152
Thank you, thank you.
I can't believe I won.

1052
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,612
By a landslide.

1053
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,239
-Really?
-Yes!

1054
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,615
Shall we do a recount?

1055
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,786
Thank you, thank you.

1056
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,207
[banging]

1057
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,208
What do you want?

1058
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,252
We really have to go pee!

1059
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,087
No, you don't.

1060
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,716
Yes, we do!
Real bad!

1061
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,217
Just take a second.

1062
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,760
They're bluffing.

1063
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:53,014
The second we open the door,
they'll try to run off.

1064
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,432
Okay, well, if you
don't let us go,

1065
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,142
then we'll just have
to go on the floor.

1066
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,935
I dare you.

1067
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,396
Okay.
Don't say we didn't warn you.

1068
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,905
Oh!
Oh, come on, man!

1069
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,448
That's gross!

1070
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:13,534
Okay, okay!
I'm opening the door!

1071
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:21,709
[screaming]

1072
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,759
[speaking foreign language]

1073
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,427
[laughing]

1074
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,599
Hey! Hey!

1075
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,893
You open this door right now!
You hear me?

1076
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,860
One of these keys can
open up this door.

1077
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,947
You know what the messed up
thing is?

1078
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:51,948
What?

1079
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,574
I really do have to pee!

1080
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,576
Great.

1081
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,502
Once you take the money, I'll
have all the evidence I need.

1082
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,215
Almost there!

1083
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,800
Come on!
Can you reach?

1084
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,927
I'm trying to get
leverage, but--

1085
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,763
-You gotta reach!
-This isn't working!

1086
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,516
I'm gonna lean back
for the leverage.

1087
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,018
-Stop moving your face!
-Keep reaching!

1088
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,395
I know!

1089
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,815
All right, you better
have a good answer.

1090
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,483
You don't even know.
Come on. Pick up.

1091
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,780
[phone rings]

1092
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,950
No, no, no, no!

1093
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,207
What is that?

1094
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,167
Dad...

1095
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,919
Robin! Robin! Robin!

1096
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,337
I can't talk right now.

1097
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,630
I have a sandwich.

1098
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,923
I'm here holding
your favorite sandwich!

1099
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,258
Please! Keep it down!

1100
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,136
No! You don't get to keep--

1101
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,804
Robin, what's going on?

1102
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,974
Everything's fine.
Just tell me what's going on.

1103
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,852
I'm sorry I ran away,
but I'm at school.

1104
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:04,020
Why are you at school?

1105
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,855
Some bad people are trying
to take over the--

1106
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,690
Aha! I got him!

1107
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,984
Robin, stay on the phone!
Hey, are you okay?

1108
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,486
Let go of me!

1109
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,904
I got the last one, boss!

1110
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,784
I got the last one!

1111
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,707
Robin Hoode.

1112
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,209
They got Robin!

1113
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,711
We have to get him
out of the there!

1114
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:31,047
How do we do that and
keep everyone else inside?

1115
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,971
-I have an idea!
-I have an idea!

1116
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,391
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the leader

1117
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:43,976
of our merry little band.

1118
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,063
You can't get away with this!
I heard everything!

1119
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:50,608
Mr. Richards will be back
and you'll have nothing.

1120
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:54,612
Hello, Mr. Hoode.
This is Acting Principal Prince.

1121
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:57,573
Your son has been caught
vandalizing school property.

1122
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,451
He'll be arrested and expelled.

1123
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,411
Have a good day.

1124
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,707
[laughing]

1125
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,590
Shut up!

1126
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,304
This the vandal?

1127
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,681
This is the miscreant.

1128
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,309
There's two other
troublemakers in the hallway.

1129
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,811
We didn't vandalize anything!

1130
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:31,107
What about my office?
There was a volcanic explosion.

1131
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,608
I can explain.

1132
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,860
What's going on here
with all of this?

1133
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,529
Just a public
school board meeting.

1134
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,739
Oh, aren't those supposed
to be public?

1135
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,952
Yes.
There's a camera over there.

1136
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,954
Well, it doesn't appear
to be plugged in.

1137
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:46,122
What?

1138
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,623
Didn't I tell you to plug it in?

1139
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,750
You told me
a lot of things!

1140
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,794
And that was probably
one of 'em.

1141
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:53,838
Officer, they're lying!
He's been stealing--

1142
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:57,299
We'll get your statement
after we get downtown.

1143
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,426
Let's go.

1144
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:04,140
Stop! You're arresting
the wrong person!

1145
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,475
He's the one you want!

1146
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,018
Those are the other two
troublemakers.

1147
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,439
Ah!

1148
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,649
[screaming]

1149
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,234
Get him!

1150
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,987
I don't take orders from you.

1151
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,114
Do you take bribes?

1152
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,158
Ooh.

1153
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,868
We've got a runner.

1154
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,871
Let me go!

1155
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,582
Get him!

1156
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,834
It's so dirty under here!

1157
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,502
Hurry up!

1158
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,008
Ah!

1159
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,891
Guys! Open the door!
Open the door! Open the door!

1160
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,477
You guys saved me!

1161
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,478
We're not done yet.

1162
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,771
Help us with these desks!

1163
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,028
Perfect! Now let's block
off the whole hallway!

1164
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,698
[shouting]

1165
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,868
Get them!

1166
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,047
It's locked, boss!

1167
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,381
Try the other door!

1168
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,258
Ah!

1169
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:24,178
Not that one,
the other one!

1170
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,660
Nice job with the desks, guys.

1171
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,704
Robin, we need to
talk to you

1172
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,498
about the way you
treat me and John.

1173
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,791
What?

1174
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:55,584
You guys are my best friends.

1175
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,588
Doesn't feel like it.

1176
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,048
There they are!

1177
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,677
Get them!

1178
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,639
Can we talk about this later?

1179
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,935
We've got bigger problems.

1180
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:19,316
Okay.
One more thing.

1181
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,776
[grunts]

1182
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,210
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
hold on!

1183
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,213
Hey, look!

1184
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:59,815
Hey, what's that sound?

1185
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,818
Marbles!

1186
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,892
Normally, I don't accept
messages from parents.

1187
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:36,685
But Charles Hoode
sent me a video

1188
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:38,520
with some
very serious allegations

1189
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,272
about our new principal.

1190
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,316
It's all stemming from
this video

1191
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,943
that his son uploaded,
you know, on the cloud.

1192
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,071
All right, guys.
We're almost home free.

1193
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,281
We just need to get
to the exit!

1194
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,036
Stop right there!

1195
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,330
Nice try.
There's more than one exit.

1196
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,374
There's no exit for you.

1197
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,168
Let's not make this any
harder than it needs to be.

1198
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:06,632
You kids already have
a long rap sheet.

1199
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,510
Well, looks like this
is our last stand.

1200
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,721
Robin, do you have any ideas?

1201
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:16,725
We just have to hope
I can find my phone.

1202
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,561
Oh, you mean this?

1203
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,355
Sorry, kids.

1204
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,774
I am going to be
school principal

1205
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:26,193
and school board President.

1206
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,445
And there's nothing
you can do to stop it!

1207
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,406
Not so fast!

1208
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:32,574
Principal Richards!

1209
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,201
What are you doing out of bed?

1210
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:38,831
Unhand those children, officer!
There are the ones you want!

1211
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:41,917
Not so fast!

1212
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:49,383
You're all under arrest.

1213
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,886
I had nothing to do with this.
I'm just saying.

1214
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,888
I don't even know
how I got here.

1215
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,058
We have you on
video taking bribes.

1216
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,978
Is that what I look like?

1217
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:03,272
You have no hard evidence.

1218
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:04,773
Look in his safe!

1219
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:05,899
You'll find the missing money.

1220
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,943
Yes, look in the safe.

1221
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,446
Oh, no, I forgot
the combination.

1222
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,989
Zero, zero, zero, zero.

1223
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:13,782
John Prince,
you're under arrest.

1224
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,076
For what?
Name one thing!

1225
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,832
Misappropriation of funds,
bribing a police officer,

1226
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:23,959
harassment, embezzlement,

1227
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,794
impersonation of
an elected official,

1228
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,421
fraud, evading the police,

1229
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,549
obstruction of justice,
child endangerment,

1230
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,801
loitering, jaywalking,

1231
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,221
27 unpaid parking tickets

1232
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:40,601
and a hazardous level of
cologne in an enclosed space.

1233
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,394
Oh, please.

1234
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,856
Ridiculous.

1235
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,750
Hey, buddy?
How about some change to help--

1236
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,751
Get a job.

1237
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,170
Ah!

1238
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,131
[clamoring]

1239
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,994
Jail is gonna be fun!

1240
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,372
If I can get a hotplate,
I'll make you pancakes!

1241
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:45,207
Will you shut up?

1242
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,714
My heroes!

1243
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:55,801
I really wanna thank you kids
for saving our school.

1244
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,344
If it weren't for you three,

1245
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,680
things would have gotten
really, really bad.

1246
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,224
In fact, I'd like to appoint
you as members

1247
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:04,893
of the Student Ambassadors
to the school board.

1248
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,103
Thank you, sir!

1249
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:08,188
-Yeah, thanks.
-Thank you so much.

1250
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,275
Sometimes all anyone needs
is a little help.

1251
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:14,111
And the gratitude to thank
those who helped him.

1252
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:23,579
Hey, Maria, I'm sorry
I rely on you so much.

1253
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,872
Having you come up with
ideas and do all the bookwork,

1254
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,165
it's not fair.

1255
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,293
We all should do our fair share.

1256
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:32,004
And I think I've been getting
by too much lately.

1257
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,047
It definitely won't
happen in the future.

1258
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,300
Thanks.
That means a lot.

1259
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,343
And, John, you're really smart.

1260
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,346
I'm going to listen to
a lot more of your ideas.

1261
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,308
What you did with the marbles?
Amazing.

1262
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:46,101
You're way more than
just an athlete.

1263
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:49,187
Appreciate that.
Really.

1264
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,897
Robin!

1265
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,275
See, what happened was...

1266
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,944
See, what happens was
you tricked me, hmm?

1267
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,529
You ran away.

1268
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:01,033
You almost got yourself hurt
and arrested in this huge mess.

1269
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,201
Sound about right?

1270
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,287
Yes.

1271
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,999
And you fought for
what you believed in

1272
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:11,335
even though
you knew it was hard.

1273
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:16,882
You know what?
I'm proud of you, kid.

1274
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,091
Good job.

1275
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,551
So does that mean I'm not--

1276
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,471
No, no, no. You're
definitely still grounded.

1277
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,640
But that doesn't mean
that we can't get

1278
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,059
ice cream after school, right?

1279
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,810
Can my friends come too?

1280
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:29,811
Well, these are
the two criminals

1281
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:32,481
that helped you escape.

1282
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:33,482
Sure, why not?

1283
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:34,650
Yay!

1284
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:35,859
But just one scoop.

1285
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:37,402
Aw...

1286
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,820
Okay, two scoops.

1287
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,238
Yay!

1288
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,366
I ain't made of money.
Come on.

1289
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,164
Mr. Hoode?

1290
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:51,917
It's come to my
attention we may have

1291
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,752
some new openings
on our school board.

1292
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,253
If I remember correctly,

1293
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,422
you have experience
handling money, correct?

1294
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,966
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I am a CPA.

1295
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,301
Oh, perfect!

1296
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,761
We'll need one
this coming Monday.

1297
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,304
See you then!

1298
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,102
Thank you, sir.

1299
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:21,154
[bell rings]

1300
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,781
All right, welcome back,
welcome back!

1301
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,408
I missed you guys!

1302
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:28,704
Give me a high-five, somebody!
There you go, there you go.

1303
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:32,708
Looking good, Joe.

1304
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,459
Hey, good to see you.
You ready for school?

1305
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,877
You excited?

1306
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:38,046
Hey, it's so good to have
you back, Mr. Richards.

1307
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,715
Thank you, thank you.

1308
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:43,802
Hi, Ms. Tuck.
I'm Robin's father.

1309
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,262
Nice to meet you.

1310
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,889
Thank you for all...
for all you do.

1311
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,433
Yeah, for sure.

1312
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:50,642
We should get coffee
or something.

1313
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,144
That'd be great.

1314
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:57,232
Welcome to your first day
as the board's new CPA.

1315
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:59,776
So let's get you settled in.

1316
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,111
Yes, excited.

1317
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:02,571
So, listen, Robin.
Have a wonderful day.

1318
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,489
If I'm not mistaken,
as of 12:01 a.m.,

1319
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,241
you're officially ungrounded.

1320
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,993
You mean it?
Thank you, dad!

1321
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,579
-All right.
-Don't leave him hanging!

1322
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,289
You can invite your friends
over after school.

1323
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:14,207
Just don't embarrass me.

1324
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:16,418
I won't.
See you later!

1325
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,336
-He's a good one.
-He's a good one.

1326
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,713
I really appreciate
this opportunity.

1327
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,133
Good morning, class!

1328
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:24,593
I don't have rubber bands!

1329
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:26,219
Well, I was just looking
for my last missing marble,

1330
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:29,097
but let's start with roll call.

1331
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,266
Or we could start with cake.

1332
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,226
What are you guys up--

1333
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:36,396
As newly-appointed members
of the School Board--

1334
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,440
We would like to congratulate
Ms. Tuck

1335
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:40,859
on becoming the interim
School Board President.

1336
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,779
[applause]

1337
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,947
Guys, you are so sweet,

1338
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,784
but, you know, part of your
job as Student Ambassadors

1339
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:51,077
to the School Board,
it's ensuring that all

1340
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,454
the money fundraised
goes exactly

1341
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:53,663
to where it's needed most.

1342
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:56,958
And this cake,
delicious as it may be,

1343
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,835
might be a waste of money.

1344
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:02,255
Don't worry, Ms. Tuck.
We made it ourselves.

1345
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:06,802
Oh, in that case, everybody
have a slice of cake!

1346
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:09,304
[cheering]

1347
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,731
[screaming]

1348
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,995
Uh, you guys okay?

1349
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,622
What happened?

1350
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,631
I thought I lost my marbles.
