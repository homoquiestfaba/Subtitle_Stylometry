1
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:15,555
My father said the Army
makes all men one.

2
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:18,224
But you never know which one.

3
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:21,144
He didn't know Roland Bozz.

4
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:26,358
Get up !

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,152
Get the fuck up !
Come on.

6
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:33,281
Get your fucking low-life asses
out of bed !

7
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:40,789
You got 15 minutes or
you'll do pushups until I pass out.

8
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:44,167
Let's go. Let's go.
Get up ! Let's go !

9
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:47,379
Get your socks on and get outside,
you fucking pussies !

10
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:51,549
Hurry up !
- Move !

11
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:54,177
- Ain't got all day.
 Move your ass, soldier.

12
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,738
Richard Nixon, drop the bomb

13
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:16,658
I don't wanna go to Nam

14
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:18,660
I don't wanna go to Nam

15
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,705
Next time won't be
no weekend in the stockade.

16
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:24,916
It'll be a full-scale
motherfucking court-martial.

17
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:29,337
Maybe a few years hard time in
Leavenworth. How's that fly, dipshit ?

18
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:33,758
Discounting reception, basic training
corrective custody....

19
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:38,513
....been in the Army more than three
months. Most of it in the stockade.

20
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:51,067
Get on that fucking deuce !
Get up on that deuce, boy !

21
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:55,572
You don't need no special
invitation, son !

22
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,575
Do as I ask ! Hoist that
GI ass on that deuce !

23
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:01,911
Let's go. Get it done !
Get it done !

24
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:13,214
Private Bozz, Roland.
No middle initial.

25
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:15,133
You're going to infantry.

26
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:18,178
I bet my left nut
they bag and tag you in a week.

27
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:21,848
Any man tries that hard to get out
will never see home again.

28
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:24,851
I don't like the rehearsal,
so I'll skip the show.

29
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:27,520
Fuck you. Get on that deuce.
Let's go !

30
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:45,205
Bozz.

31
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:50,710
I got a buddy in Charlie Company
says he knows a fellow by that name.

32
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:53,588
Says he's the biggest fuckup
in the Army.

33
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:58,218
Clowning around and always acting
like fucking bozo.

34
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:03,098
Article 15, recycled through
basic, all kinds of goldbrick shit.

35
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:08,645
Sounds to me like that fellow's
no more than a goddamn coward.

36
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:11,356
Afraid of Tigerland, huh ?

37
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:12,816
Should be scared.

38
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,402
They hump your ass until it falls off.

39
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:20,365
- I heard a guy from Bravo died there.
- No, man, that's a rumor.

40
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:24,452
You afraid of big old Tigerland,
Private Fuckup ?

41
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:28,915
Read this and tell me what happens.
I gotta get away from this guy.

42
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:34,129
Go for it, Bozz !

43
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:37,841
Private Bozz !

44
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:45,140
What the fuck ?
Stop the goddamn truck !

45
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:51,396
Goddamn it !
What the fuck is your problem ?

46
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:54,399
You stupid motherfucker !
You're nothing but a-

47
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:56,985
Get back in that truck,
you little fuck !

48
00:03:57,193 --> 00:04:00,155
The rest of you motherfuckers,
sit your asses down !

49
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:04,242
Good morning, gentlemen.

50
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:06,494
My name is Captain Saunders.

51
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:08,705
Commanding officer, Alpha Company.

52
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:10,999
Third advance infantry
training brigade.

53
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:13,293
Welcome to the infantry, gentlemen.

54
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:17,672
No matter where you did your basic,
either Fort Polk or elsewhere....

55
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:21,301
....rest assured that we train the
proudest, the toughest....

56
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,136
....the best-equipped soldiers.

57
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:27,515
This base is the largest supplier
of combat troops overseas.

58
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:30,518
So don't let any man here
start having any little....

59
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,813
....pasty fucking daydreams
about being anyplace else.

60
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,648
I shit you not, gentlemen.

61
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:38,777
You are headed for
a two-way firing range.

62
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,237
You will be sent to the war.

63
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,282
You will be here for an
eight-week training cycle.

64
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:47,285
After that, you will remain here
for a week more.

65
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:50,622
We will ship you to an outpost
10 miles from here....

66
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:55,210
....that is known throughout the Army
as the second worst place on earth.

67
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:56,878
Tigerland.

68
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:59,714
It is the stateside province
of Vietnam....

69
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:03,051
....and it is as close to the war
as we can make it.

70
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,179
Now, gentlemen,
it behooves you to learn....

71
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,765
....what little we can teach you here.

72
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:11,184
For if you do, then maybe....

73
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:12,644
....just maybe....

74
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:17,107
....you will return one day to play
stink-finger with Sally back home.

75
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:18,358
Let's get squared away.

76
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:22,028
Those of you not on detail
will have a pass for the weekend.

77
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,614
Training begins Monday at 0430.

78
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:28,785
From that time on, every
son of a bitch humps his own load.

79
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:44,801
- Sucky-sucky, baby ?
- Oh, no, thank you.

80
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:04,195
There you go.

81
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,995
- You got a high sex drive.
- You're right.

82
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,371
Which line says that ?

83
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:16,958
I'm no expert but it says
you're gonna have sex real soon.

84
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,712
- What about me ?
- Sex for Sheri as well.

85
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,300
There you go.

86
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,886
- Did you read it ?
 No, I didn't.

87
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:31,181
Me, neither. I keep it around
to piss everybody off.

88
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,432
Jim Paxton.

89
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:37,812
Let's not become friends. You could
die and I'd miss you too much.

90
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,314
Excuse me ?

91
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,777
- It's a joke, forget it. Roland Bozz.
- Okay.

92
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:46,946
This here is Sheri and Claudia
or Claudia and Sheri.

93
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:48,615
Ladies, Jim Paxton.

94
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:51,659
- Good to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

95
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:53,536
Charmed, I'm sure.

96
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:56,164
- Let me buy you ladies a drink.
 Mm, right on.

97
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:57,832
Four, please.

98
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,418
- You girls from here ?
- Born and bred. You ?

99
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,212
- Upstate New York.
- New York.

100
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,254
Wow.

101
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,216
How about you, Bozz ?
Where are you from ?

102
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:09,552
Texas, Jim. It's in the
Southwestern part of the U.S.

103
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:13,807
Oh, yeah ? Well, I'll double-check
that on the map. Thanks.

104
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:16,309
They came down hard on you in company.

105
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,312
- I'm surprised they let you off base.
- They didn't.

106
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:22,607
- I'm confined to company air.
- Oh, you're AWOL ?

107
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,234
Shh, man, the children.

108
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:26,820
To peace on earth
and a cure for cancer.

109
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,114
- Cheers.
- Amen.

110
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:32,242
Don't take it all so seriously, Jim.
Lighten up.

111
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,413
Man, all I said was, "To peace on
earth and a cure for cancer. "

112
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:39,332
- Who said it's a joke ?
- You're doing a routine.

113
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:41,876
A funny soldier with
two girls in a bar-

114
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,837
Man, I'm not doing any routine.

115
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,881
If you're gonna be an asshole
about it, fuck you.

116
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:50,593
Now, Jim, that's not the answer.

117
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:53,722
Oh, really, smart-ass ?
Then what is ?

118
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,474
The answer is, I got a hotel room.

119
00:07:56,683 --> 00:08:00,186
We're gonna take these ladies
and fuck till the war is over.

120
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:02,147
Okay.

121
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,801
Hello. This is fun.

122
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:34,637
Oh, really, really fun.

123
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:38,391
- It's not bad for a couple grunts.
- Not bad for a couple grunts ?

124
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,977
Who are you ?
Sergeant Rock, Easy Company ?

125
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:44,898
Who are you playing ?
Absurd man in an absurd world ?

126
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:47,650
You're playing a fool
fighting the system.

127
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,320
- There's a difference, Paxton.
- Really, what ?

128
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,489
I'm a failed fool.

129
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:57,577
Yeah, you've got a rep. I heard
you're the biggest fool around.

130
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,079
Oh, well, thank you.

131
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:02,165
But that's it.
I'm still here when I should be out.

132
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:04,584
- And I'm gonna get out.
- Not me.

133
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,252
I enlisted.

134
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:08,421
- Is this some war shit again ?
 Yes.

135
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,340
- I got the munchies.
 Me too.

136
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,177
I wish I hadn't heard you say that.
I was starting to like you.

137
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,555
You know, I thought a lot
about it, Bozz.

138
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,182
I don't like the war.

139
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:22,894
Maybe I'm even against it.
But I'm not against my country.

140
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:25,772
Is there room service here ?
Where's the phone ?

141
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:29,025
That's some fancy
political thinking, professor.

142
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:32,320
Let me give you some advice.
Figure out a way to go.

143
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:35,156
- Get out, singing while you go.
 Guys, help us.

144
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:39,035
We're hungry, you know ?
 Me too, man.

145
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,997
You know, that's not all, man.
It's not just political.

146
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:46,334
I want to go.
I want to see what it's like.

147
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,628
I want the experience.
I'm taking notes on everything.

148
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:53,133
Shut up. I'm taking notes
on everything. One day-

149
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:57,345
One day I'll write something
like James Jones or Hemingway.

150
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,847
What will you write ?

151
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,267
That war is hell, men are brave,
that kind of old crap ?

152
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:06,021
So you've popped my fucking balloon.
Jesus Christ, Bozz.

153
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,648
- 24-hour place on Bourbon Street.

154
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:10,108
Give me the lighter.

155
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,369
The girls are gone.

156
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:24,914
Yes, they are.

157
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,043
Okay.

158
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:40,972
Hey, how you doing ?

159
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,267
Keep your head down.

160
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,437
Fucking AWOL, piece of shit
son of a bitch.

161
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,939
That bag of shit of yours in the dirt.

162
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:53,777
Private Bozz is showing the
proper way to dig a hole under fire.

163
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:57,072
Under fire, you will fall
to the earth and lie flat.

164
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,909
Under fire, you will ask God
to remove your button....

165
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:02,952
....to get closer to the ground.

166
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:06,706
Under fire you will dig a hole
with your teeth if you have to.

167
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:08,291
Open your mouth.

168
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:10,794
Now, shitbird.

169
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,212
Do it ! Eat dirt !

170
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,424
I don't hear you. "Yes, sergeant. "

171
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:20,011
- I'm still not hearing you.
- You wear a dress, sergeant ?

172
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:27,686
- What did you say, you piece of crap ?
- Go kiss my ass, sergeant !

173
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,481
You little finger-fucking cocksucker.

174
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:34,567
I will make you push Fort Polk
into the sea !

175
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:37,070
Sir, I already have a man in mind.

176
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:38,405
Thank you.

177
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,365
Eat dirt. Do it !

178
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,033
Do it ! Eat dirt !

179
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:46,037
- Eat it !
 Sergeant, that's enough.

180
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,914
Get these men moving.

181
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,292
Move it ! You heard the man.

182
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,586
Let's move it ! Get going !

183
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,425
Miter, you're the new platoon guide,
the 2nd Platoon.

184
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:01,052
Get Bozz in line.
If it don't happen....

185
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:04,180
....even Jesus won't be able
to save you, understand ?

186
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,434
- Yes, sergeant.
- Have these men fall in and fall out.

187
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,602
Platoon, fall in.

188
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:13,148
Fall out to your weapons.

189
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:23,825
Bozz, Bozz, Bozz, Bozz,
Bozz, Bozz, Bozz !

190
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:27,537
What is wrong with you, private ?
Move your ass, son.

191
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,788
Let's go.

192
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,081
Move it !

193
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,916
- Bozz.
- Let's go !

194
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:36,421
Get that bag of shit in the dirt.

195
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,803
That's mine.

196
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:57,400
Ba-doo, ba-doo
 On my mind

197
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,694
- Ba-doo, ba-doo
- I'm still trying to find

198
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:03,239
I want to take her home to my mama

199
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,283
Platoon, listen up.

200
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:08,244
Platoon, we got a heavy day tomorrow.

201
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:09,871
Everybody hit the racks.

202
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:11,289
Lights out.

203
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:15,293
Lights out.
 You like being in control ?

204
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:18,630
I ain't took no shower.
I gotta take one.

205
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,135
God, shut up.

206
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:28,223
I don't fuck with you when
you're talking, so don't fuck with me.

207
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,351
Sergeant Thomas.

208
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,730
Private Cantwell reporting
to the weapon shed as ordered.

209
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,608
Sergeant Thomas ?

210
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,647
Glad you waited up for me, Dad.

211
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:20,025
I think everybody did, Bozz.

212
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:24,404
This the scene where the troublemaker
gets beaten by his buddies ?

213
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:26,239
Somebody got beaten.

214
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:28,908
Cantwell.

215
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:36,249
Jesus !

216
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,419
- What happened ?
- I think it was Sergeant Thomas.

217
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:40,628
Damn it.

218
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:42,505
Anybody report it ?

219
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:46,009
Why ? It's not gonna put
his face back together.

220
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,511
He was trying
to fuck around like you.

221
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,182
I'm sorry this happened to you.

222
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:55,435
There ain't gonna be
no more clowning from you.

223
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,104
You hear ?
Go wash up and hit the rack.

224
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:01,858
Shut your cake-hole, Miter.
You're giving Cantwell a headache.

225
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:06,738
I'm telling you, and that's like
getting an order from the sergeant.

226
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,115
Don't make me put you on report.

227
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:12,577
Give it a rest.
It's been a hard day for all of us.

228
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:15,914
Don't you give me a hard time, Paxton.
You're okay.

229
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:18,958
You'll be a good soldier,
but this individual-

230
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:23,755
He wants to be a bumblefuck.
He wants to laugh at everything we do.

231
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,674
He'll hurt this platoon.

232
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,717
What are you, 20 years old ?

233
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:31,971
Just because you wear sergeant stripes
don't mean you ain't gonna die.

234
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,557
Where you going that we ain't, Bozz ?

235
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:39,354
You best start to soldiering, boy,
or you're coming home in a bag.

236
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:11,720
Fuck.

237
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,149
Just wanted you to know,
I've taken a great dislike to you.

238
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:27,152
- Is there anything else, Wilson ?
- No.

239
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,320
I don't reckon there is.

240
00:16:58,141 --> 00:17:02,228
I'm gonna tell you something.
This is the last time you'll hear it.

241
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,898
You can't kill a dink with a ricochet.

242
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:08,193
Oh, this is all about killing people ?
Well, shit.

243
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,955
So you can shoot when you want to.

244
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,582
When I want to.

245
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,959
Idea of killing dinks excite you ?

246
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,672
Cease fire. Cease fire.

247
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,549
Get your targets, scumbags.

248
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,511
AII clear.

249
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,891
You can't hit your
targets, there'll be hell to pay.

250
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,771
Shit, I do believe that's
Cantwell's target there, boys.

251
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:49,401
- Not a single bullet hole in it.
 Shut your face, Wilson.

252
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,028
Thomas'll chew my ass for chow.

253
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,948
You ain't gonna be making
any phone calls home.

254
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:59,828
You gonna be busy. AII asses and
elbows, picking up ciggie butts.

255
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,914
You're a one-man campaign
to make the world uglier.

256
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,710
- I ain't afraid of you, Bozz.
- Yes, you are, Wilson.

257
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:10,880
- You're just too stupid to realize it.
- Okay then, Sunday school.

258
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,509
You're such a goddamn saint,
give Cantwell your target.

259
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,846
- I'll give him yours.
- You take that and I'll-

260
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,391
Jesus H. Christ, what's
the purpose of this clusterfuck ?

261
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,519
- Wilson switched targets with Cantwell.
- That's true.

262
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,271
- That's bullshit.
- Lie down.

263
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,356
- Permission to-
- Now, shitbird !

264
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:29,983
Yes, sergeant.

265
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,154
You know why this man's on the ground ?
Because he's dead !

266
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,239
He's dead.

267
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:39,242
And you can't bury him.
Do you know why ?

268
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,703
- Why, sarge ?
Because you're dead too !

269
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,747
You're all dead....

270
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:47,500
....because you don't know how
to fire weapons on semiautomatic.

271
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,420
Or how to hit Charlie
with short bursts....

272
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:53,298
....so your goddamn barrels
don't overheat.

273
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,968
And because this shitbag
can't hit his fucking target.

274
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:58,595
Any questions ?

275
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:00,722
No, sergeant.
- I got a question.

276
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,767
If I'm dead, how come
I can ask you a question ?

277
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:07,937
I know exactly what you're doing,
you pissant fairy.

278
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,023
I want you....

279
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,277
....and your two girlfriends here....

280
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:17,489
....to report to the mess sergeant
after chow tonight.

281
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,449
Get up, Lazarus.

282
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,493
You're resurrected.

283
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,829
Get up.

284
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,207
Cantwell.

285
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,518
You're getting a lot less funny, Bozz.

286
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,063
There's some big old
moon shining down.

287
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:53,149
Reminds you what this
world is all about.

288
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:57,028
- What, peeling potatoes ?
- It's good you talk so slow, Cantwell.

289
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,280
Paxton there is taking notes.

290
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,282
Maybe he'll put you in a book.

291
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,828
the bumpkin saint.

292
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,206
I don't rightly know
what you're talking about.

293
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,083
I don't read much.

294
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,922
Never got past sixth grade.

295
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,217
Got married. Got a wife back home.

296
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:21,386
Poor little girl.

297
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,388
She has seizures.

298
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,181
These spells, you know ?

299
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,393
Four children gotta go
without a mama now and again.

300
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:32,147
Jesus, Cantwell, when did you get
married ? When you were 12 ?

301
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,649
Hell, no.

302
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,984
I was 15.

303
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:40,655
We had two together.
She had two previous.

304
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,575
I'm 19, but she's a might older.
She's 28.

305
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,579
I got a little boy who's 1
and a little girl who's 2.

306
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,123
What the fuck are you doing here, man ?

307
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:57,630
Don't it strike you how
it's the same moon shining ?

308
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,300
And it's shining down on us here....

309
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,887
....and shining down on
that little girl who's my wife.

310
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:05,972
It's the same moon....

311
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:08,433
....that'll be shining
when we go to war.

312
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,645
Same moon that's shining down on
those boys getting shot.

313
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,315
Don't it strike you what it means ?

314
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,818
How each of us is a bit of everything.

315
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:22,030
And everything is shit.

316
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:25,992
I know that back home....

317
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:28,912
....preacher be talking about
right and wrong.

318
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,665
About the Lord and God and Jesus.

319
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,334
But you know....

320
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,462
....if the Lord or God or Jesus....

321
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,964
....be standing here right now....

322
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,133
....he'd say, "Cantwell....

323
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,138
....you forget about
all these promises.

324
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,350
You forget about what all anybody say.

325
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:54,521
And you forget about all them
big Sunday fancy ideas.

326
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,648
Even what we tell you.

327
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,402
You look up there.

328
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,781
Did you ever see such a moon ?"

329
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,952
Goddamn it, Cantwell.

330
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,621
Shit.

331
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,750
Shit.

332
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,545
Fuck, I don't even know you, man.

333
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,506
You sitting there
telling your fucking story.

334
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,721
Make me want to fucking cry.
What's that about ?

335
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,058
I mean, fuck you, Cantwell.
The world is fucking made of pain.

336
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:35,854
You shouldn't even be in this army.

337
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,191
You're just too stupid
to get yourself out.

338
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,318
I told them my predicament.

339
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,613
They said, "Wait till you go
to war, then complain. "

340
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,574
And you bought that ?

341
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,159
The man said it.

342
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,620
I know Army regulations
the way prisoners know the law.

343
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,789
You're a hardship discharge, man.

344
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,379
Okay. Look, I'll get you
out of the Army.

345
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,215
What are you saying ?
You don't care about him.

346
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,719
Jim, shut the fuck up.
I know what I'm doing here.

347
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:10,555
Just peel some
fucking potatoes or something.

348
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,935
One, two, three.
 Two.

349
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,979
- One, two, three.
- Three.

350
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:20,357
- One, two, three.
- Four.

351
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,026
- One, two, three.
- Five.

352
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,916
Who put you up to this, son ?

353
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:39,876
Nobody, sir.

354
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:42,545
- I know my rights.
- No, you don't.

355
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,758
Your case won't be reviewed until
after you're overseas. Dismissed.

356
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,846
No, sir.
I don't believe that's correct.

357
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,809
And I believe if you don't allow me
to see a J.A.G. officer, sir....

358
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,853
....then under the uniform code
of military justice....

359
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,981
....I can file a complaint
with the inspector general.

360
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,566
And nobody can keep me.

361
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,694
Jesus Christ !

362
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,364
When did "My country, right or wrong"
turn into "Fuck this" ?

363
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:12,992
It's Private Bozz, sir.
I can smell him from here.

364
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,579
No, sir, it wasn't Bozz.

365
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:19,290
I read it. In a book.

366
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,464
You read it ? In a book ?

367
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,675
Yes, sir.

368
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,969
How far did you get in school ?

369
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,097
Almost sixth grade, sir.

370
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,893
I guess they study law early
where you come from.

371
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,356
Sir, if I may speak frankly.

372
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:46,526
You underestimate the harm
someone like Bozz can do.

373
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,278
He's bad for the Army, sir.

374
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:52,615
Everything's bad
for the Army these days. Even war.

375
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:57,454
Now drive your knee through his face.
Shove his brain through his ear. Good !

376
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,122
Thank you, sir.

377
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,500
What's your solution ?
Shit-can him out of the Army ?

378
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,003
Of course not. That's what he wants.

379
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:07,047
- Exactly.
- Court-martial him.

380
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,174
I guarantee he'll snap shit then.

381
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,926
Sergeant, you know we won't
court-martial him.

382
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,012
It'll cost beaucoup dollars....

383
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,141
....and battalion will ask why I can't
keep one asshole trainee in line.

384
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,227
Five weeks from now,
he'll be in the war.

385
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,939
And he'll soldier then, by God.
Good or bad. Sure as shit.

386
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,610
Maybe not. Got Cantwell out.
Two other guys from his squad.

387
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:33,365
Every son of a bitch J.A.G. shrink
bleeding heart pissed down on us.

388
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,657
That's Bozz, sir.

389
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,410
X-ray vision for loopholes in the ARs.

390
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,788
Sergeant, we are losing a war.

391
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,124
The whole goddamn Army
is falling apart.

392
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,212
You want me to fiddle-fuck around
with one smart-ass barracks lawyer ?

393
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,381
I think he's something more, sir.

394
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,134
- Is that all, sergeant ?
- Yes, sir.

395
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,182
What the hell you doing, soldier ? !
Goddamn it, Bozz !

396
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,811
You're supposed to strangle him,
not become his fuck buddy !

397
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,396
Yes, sergeant.

398
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,552
Pussy-fucking-coward.

399
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,515
What the fuck you looking at,
you bunch of no-nut sad sacks ?

400
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,351
Get your little pussies back to work !

401
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,942
You try that again,
you're gonna be pissing blood, Bozz.

402
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,657
Now get those little pussies
back to work....

403
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,119
....you bunch of sad sack,
no-nut fuckups !

404
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,289
Hey, Bozz, you did well by Cantwell.

405
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,460
He's two-stepping from the poorhouse
with a crazy wife. I envy him.

406
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,045
You saved his life.

407
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,214
Shit, sometimes when we talk,
my stomach hurts.

408
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,301
I don't care what you say.
You should feel good.

409
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,720
Good shit, pussy-fucking-coward.

410
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,222
I won't be proud until Wilson's out.

411
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,933
Know what would settle your ass ?
A blanket party.

412
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,728
Put a blanket over you,
hit you with a rock.

413
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,689
Shut up, Wilson.
I'll stop this damn truck.

414
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,317
- Both of you can walk back-
- You bastard....

415
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,486
....you think you so damn smart.

416
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,614
I hear Northern boys
are the first to go in Vietnam.

417
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,533
Yeah, but at least
we can find it on a map.

418
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,994
Real fucking funny, Pax.

419
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,164
Ain't nobody gonna die.
Keep that talk to yourself.

420
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:50,210
Ain't nobody gonna die ? Shit, Miter,
you're one damn dumb cracker.

421
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,922
When you go home, they'll call you
"Mr. No-Legs Motherfucker. "

422
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,883
- That any better ?
- You watch yourself, mister.

423
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,552
I still got these stripes.
Acting sarge.

424
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,806
You're chicken without
that stripe down your back.

425
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:07,143
- I ain't seen a dink that can take me.
- Jesus, Wilson, you a dumb-fuck.

426
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,896
Them motherfuckers
killed the Chinese ass....

427
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,565
....and the French ass.
They gonna kick ours.

428
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:17,696
- Who are you ? "Ask Mr. Negro Wizard" ?
- My brother was there in '68.

429
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,322
Don't make you no hero.

430
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,825
You know what your problem is, Wilson ?

431
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,285
You need to listen for the pop.

432
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,371
What's "the pop," Johnson ?

433
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:33,503
The sound you'll make when your head
exits your ass for the first time.

434
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,882
Damn, Johnson,
I know you a damn coward.

435
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,427
Now I believe you a damn communist.

436
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:44,180
Maybe a damn faggot alongside
being a goddamn nigger.

437
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,808
- Oh, hell no !
 Ain't this some shit.

438
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,147
- Want a piece of me, chump ?
 Get him !

439
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,982
Get him !
 Get off of me.

440
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,862
Get off, motherfucker !

441
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,155
Come on !

442
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,907
That's enough.

443
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,210
Which one of you motherfuckers
killed my truck ?

444
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,087
Get off me, man !
 Get off !

445
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,299
AII right, now, you truckload of shit.

446
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,177
Fess up, or the whole
damn drag-ass squad....

447
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,597
....does the airborne shuffle
six miles back to base.

448
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,851
Goddamn it, shit for brains !
Who did it ?

449
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,732
I did it, sergeant.

450
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,650
Good. Come down here, boy.

451
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,611
And bring your shit !

452
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,658
Rest of you, sit your asses down.

453
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:10,350
Nobody saves anybody,
you stupid son of a bitch.

454
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,686
What the fuck are you doing, man ?

455
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,063
It's not doing me any favors.

456
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,989
Charlie 6, this is Charlie 2.

457
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,617
Miter has properly demonstrated....

458
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:31,538
....the use of the TA-312 field radio.

459
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,667
Except for this,
which is not in the manual.

460
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,628
If you ever catch Charlie....

461
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,048
....you might want info on where
the rest of his buddies is.

462
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,970
Only Charlie is a close-lipped
bastard who won't tell you fuck all.

463
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:51,016
That's why you tie his gook hands,
take down his gook pants....

464
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,852
....and grab his gook balls.

465
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,104
Here, Miter, hold these.

466
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,524
You pinch these clips on each
of his slant-eyed nuts....

467
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,193
....and you juice up the radio....

468
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,534
....that'll send enough shock so
he'll tell you anything you want.

469
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,996
Hell, he'll tell you
the minor league baseball scores.

470
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,956
- You read me ?
- Yes, sergeant.

471
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:20,003
He'll tell you how his mother wipes
her ass if you give him this juice.

472
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,299
Not only that, you'll be able
to find him real easy next time.

473
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,218
Because he'll light up
the fucking night.

474
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,937
No one said you could leave.

475
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,607
- Why ?
- Why what ?

476
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,276
Why would I do that
to another human being ?

477
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,573
Brother's right.

478
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:52,035
What the fuck's wrong with you ?
That's one of your men.

479
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,995
Get him back here, boy.

480
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,497
- Bozz !
- Go get him, boy.

481
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,248
Jesus, Bozz.

482
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,209
Don't do this to me.

483
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,754
Get back here,
you worthless sack of shit !

484
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,464
Bozz !

485
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,136
You can't control your own men,
it is your ass.

486
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,846
Drop trou.

487
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,724
- What ?
- Drop trou !

488
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,396
Double-time, come on ! Skivvies too.

489
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,193
Well, what do you know ?
You do have a pair of balls after all.

490
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,655
- Wilson, crank this thing.
- Yes, sergeant.

491
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,949
We'll now demonstrate
the proper way....

492
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,577
....to give information
when connected to the TA-312.

493
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,872
See if you can tell me
why you can't control your men.

494
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,625
See if you light up tonight.

495
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,505
Light him up.
 Shut the fuck up, Hicks.

496
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,840
Contact.

497
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,307
Never even touched you, son.

498
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,229
That's it. Class dismissed.
Go on to your next class.

499
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,939
Go on.

500
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,650
Go on !

501
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,241
Wilson, looks like we're having
roasted nuts tonight, huh ?

502
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,994
I didn't know you
was so goddamn funny.

503
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,233
I can't wait to catch me a VC,
spark his balls off.

504
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,736
I'll start with you tonight, Miter.

505
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,405
Got this, Pax ?
The crazed, sadistic soldier....

506
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,157
....who flips out and kills people.

507
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,618
I think I saw you look at
Miter's balls earlier.

508
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,828
Funny there, Bozz. Funny, yeah.

509
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,499
You're a disgrace to the uniform,
fucking piece of shit !

510
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,751
Hey ! Hey, what the fuck ?

511
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,380
Break it up, man !

512
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,259
Get the fuck up ! Civilian bullshit !

513
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,805
What the hell is going on ? Miter !

514
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,475
You better do some fast explaining
or your men in a world of hurt.

515
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,352
There was an argument....

516
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,980
-....and one of the men-
- Slipped on the soap in the shower.

517
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,191
Wrestling. It got out of hand.

518
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,319
It happens when people live together,
fuck together.

519
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,576
Sorry, soldier, you must've
slipped on some soap yourself.

520
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,120
What's wrong with you ?

521
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,623
Look like you ate some frozen shit
for breakfast.

522
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,045
Nothing's wrong, sergeant.

523
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,382
It better stay that way,
you read me ? AII of you.

524
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,345
- Goddamn it, do you hear me ?
- Yes, sergeant !

525
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:02,684
You got guard duty. Four listening
posts at the edge of the perimeter.

526
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,270
Dig yourself a hole and
forget about chow.

527
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,526
Out here, you're challenged on guard
duty. And you do it by the book.

528
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,571
But in Nam, if you hear something
in the bushes....

529
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,865
....I mean anything, you open fire.

530
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,660
You fire into those bushes until
you kill whatever made that sound.

531
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,496
When the sun comes up,
I don't give a fuck....

532
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,958
....whether it's man, woman, child
or little Johnny next door.

533
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,377
Kill it or you're not coming home.

534
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,421
Like the My Lai massacre, sergeant ?

535
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,718
Paxton....

536
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,262
....why don't you join
your asshole buddy ?

537
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:43,058
Missing a meal would be good for
your wisecracking ass also.

538
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,021
Now let's fall back in for chow !

539
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,858
Goddamn it, do it now !
You want to march six miles tonight ?

540
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,777
Fucking weapons at ease !

541
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,907
Feel like I'm digging
my own fucking grave here.

542
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,243
When I was a kid....

543
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,372
....I used to think I could
dig my way to China.

544
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,291
You watched too many cartoons, Jim.

545
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,213
Maybe if we dig long and hard enough,
we'll tunnel our way out of this dump.

546
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,714
Why don't you ?

547
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,467
My arm's too tired.

548
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,846
No, really. Why don't you get
yourself out of the Army ?

549
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,516
I'm not that brave.

550
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,772
In that case, I'll just have to
bury you myself !

551
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,964
Move it out ! Come on, move it out !

552
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,593
Stay the fuck down !

553
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,890
Stay the fuck where you are !

554
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,725
Move ! You got to move it !

555
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:52,103
Stay the fuck down !
They're firing in our path !

556
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,941
- Move it !
Cease fire.

557
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,777
Miter !
What's wrong with you ?

558
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,072
When your men are told to move out,
they move out !

559
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,157
When I give orders,
you're supposed to jump.

560
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,950
- Do you read me ?
- Yes, sergeant !

561
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,788
The M-60s fired directly across
our path ! They'd have cut us in two !

562
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,875
Who told you to open your fucking
mouth ? Miter's platoon guide !

563
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:17,128
You gotta flank that M-60 !
Is that clear ?

564
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:18,922
Yes, sir.

565
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,341
If you want these
dumb-ass bitches dead....

566
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,635
....you wouldn't take them
in the belly of a pig....

567
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,804
....with a 762 to split their skull !

568
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,098
You flank the objective !

569
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,808
- You read me ?
- Yes, sergeant !

570
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,936
- Get these fucking men out the hole !
- Move it out !

571
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,938
Stay down ! Stay down !

572
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,399
Stay down !

573
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,235
What did you say, maggot-brained
son of a bitch ? !

574
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,486
I said, stay down.

575
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,530
Get these men out the hole now !

576
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,616
- Platoon guide, do it ! Move it !
- Come on, goddamn it !

577
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,868
Stay down.

578
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,579
Are you stupid enough
to fuck with me, boy ?

579
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,582
Tomorrow at base
it's you, me and the captain.

580
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,169
If your insubordinate ass ain't
in stockade by midday chow....

581
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,213
....I'll kill you myself !

582
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,300
You won't kill me, sergeant.

583
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,013
I don't know what you'll do to me,
but you won't kill me.

584
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,770
- Goddamn you, Bozz !
Out of the trench !

585
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,480
Don't turn your back on me !

586
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,066
Get your ass with the other men now !

587
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,486
I understand your position. I ain't
trying to fuck things up for you.

588
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:27,240
You got your army to run and people
to kill. I'm not part of it.

589
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,992
Nobody quits the Army.

590
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,577
I'm not quitting....

591
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,912
....I'm just not playing.

592
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,165
What's your first name, sergeant ?

593
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,001
Ezra.

594
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,753
Ezra.

595
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,546
Can I offer you a smoke ?

596
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,596
What the fuck is wrong with you ? !

597
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,265
- That doesn't fucking do it !
- No, sergeant !

598
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,225
That doesn't fucking do it !

599
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,811
Give me a fucking answer !

600
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,521
Fuck !

601
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,649
Now you listen to me, son.

602
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,320
I been to where you're going.

603
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,573
Over there, you go from
living to dead awful quick.

604
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,619
What I'm trying to teach you may
save your worthless life, maybe.

605
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:17,165
I tell you what. If you snap shit
and soldier like I know you can....

606
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,126
....I'll forget about this.
- Can't.

607
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,755
Shit, even if I wanted to,
I'm not there anymore.

608
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:26,716
What kind of bullshit
statement is this ?

609
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,343
Ezra, no.

610
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,220
It's just me.

611
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,515
Okay, Bozz, all right.

612
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,392
I'm gonna let you go.

613
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,144
But now it's you
and the CO, I'm out of it.

614
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:43,149
Soldier, this army's gonna come down
on your ass hard. Both feet.

615
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,984
You know that, don't you ?

616
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:49,197
They'll push through your papers
and send you where the dying's sweet.

617
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,117
Is this a trick ?

618
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,747
Trying to make me a hero
or something ?

619
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,001
Nope.

620
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,379
Well, good, Ezra.

621
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,133
Now you get your ass up and
join these men right now.

622
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,220
You're a big fucking baby !
Get out of my sight.

623
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,895
Miter !
 What's he doing ?

624
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:24,399
- Sergeant Landers !
What is it now ?

625
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,527
Miter !

626
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,321
Miter !

627
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:42,584
- That's enough, sergeant.
- You got some fucking nerve, shitbag !

628
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:49,716
Come on !

629
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,594
Time to go home, soldier !

630
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,472
I said, that's enough !

631
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,557
Let's go.

632
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,486
Goddamn it, you men will
learn to soldier.

633
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:13,573
The next dick tries a stunt like that
gets my size-14 Deltas....

634
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,534
....so far up their ass
they'll choke on the heel !

635
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:20,330
- Do you understand !
- Yes, sergeant !

636
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,416
You ! Paxton !

637
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,920
- How much school have you had ?
- Two years of college.

638
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,881
You're the next platoon guide.
Arrest him.

639
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,425
They didn't teach us
how to do that in college.

640
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:35,887
Are you some kind of fucking idiot ?
You inbred retard.

641
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,264
You don't know how to do a thing,
do you ?

642
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,392
Tell the man he's under arrest....

643
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,478
....he's confined to barracks,
he won't leave the area.

644
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:46,606
You get a card table
and set it up at the door !

645
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,108
Why, sergeant ?

646
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:52,153
So a guard can sit there, you
backed-up, sperm-brained college boy.

647
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:54,906
You're fired as platoon guide,
dumb-ass dipshit !

648
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,744
- You think that's funny ? !
- No !

649
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:00,745
Goddamn it !

650
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,541
Goddamn it ! Give me 10, you
think it's fucking funny !

651
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,546
- Wilson !
- Yes, sergeant.

652
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,631
Get a card table.

653
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,966
You're on guard.

654
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,555
Guard, sergeant ?

655
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,016
You heard me !
You want these 14s up your ass ?

656
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,600
No, sergeant !

657
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,442
Bozz.

658
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,943
You're new platoon guide.

659
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,031
You put that piece of shit
under arrest.

660
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,951
You tell these men to get their
haircuts. Every swinging dick.

661
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:42,495
Congratulations, sweetheart.

662
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,540
Sorry about that, Jim.

663
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:46,875
Oh, man.

664
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,001
Jealous ?

665
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,045
Miter.

666
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,880
How you doing, man ?

667
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,388
Okay, guys !

668
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,683
I ain't taking any of this
shit seriously.

669
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:07,270
Just do what you have to do
so we can live together.

670
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,148
If any of you are gonna run off
and hide, let me know.

671
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:12,609
You can't do this.
You ain't got the rights.

672
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,279
Bleeding-heart son of a bitch.
It ain't your army. Hear me ?

673
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:19,324
Sit the fuck down at your
dumb card table, punk.

674
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,868
Hey, fellas. Hey !

675
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,747
Look, all I know is that no one's
talked to me like that....

676
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,709
....since I got in this goddamned
green mean machine.

677
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,836
Damn right.
 I attest to that.

678
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:35,423
So yeah, Bozz.
See what happens, baby.

679
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:39,094
What else they gonna do, send us
to Viet-fucking-Nam ?

680
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,387
Too late for that.

681
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:46,017
Say, Bozz ? Can I get a weekend pass ?

682
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,020
Put your panties away,
your mama's panties.

683
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:53,400
They're your mama's panties.
You ain't been laid in three years.

684
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,528
Get me off this base, I'll show you !

685
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:02,158
Miter, baby, you gotta lay still.
Gotta lay still, man.

686
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:03,993
Take a deep breath.

687
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,789
Take this shit off.

688
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:14,045
You gotta relax.

689
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,515
- Shit, you gonna run again ?
- Yeah.

690
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:10,435
I hear people in New Orleans
help me get to Mexico.

691
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,561
It ain't that easy.

692
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,522
Army's got men, their whole job's
to look for you.

693
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:15,982
I don't care.

694
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:19,319
They'll catch you, bring you here
and put you in prison.

695
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,615
You best move, don't make me
have to thump you.

696
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,576
Want to go to military prison ?
You're not that crazy.

697
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,916
Shut the fuck up !

698
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,462
Calm the fuck down, you'll wake
up Wilson. You don't want that.

699
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,520
Shit. What you gonna do now ?

700
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,022
I'll bust my hand.
I'll bust my hand.

701
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,566
- Shit, man, that won't work.
- Watch !

702
00:46:58,775 --> 00:46:59,984
I said, that won't work !

703
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:03,113
Bust my hand, they'll have to
let me out. Right ?

704
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,740
- It ain't gonna work.
- Come on, Bozz !

705
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,160
Break my goddamn hand
so I can go home !

706
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,431
You know what I am, Bozz ?
I'm a butcher.

707
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,016
Yeah, we all butchers.

708
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,018
No, I'm a real butcher.

709
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:37,063
- You haven't killed anyone yet.
- Goddamn it, I mean a real butcher !

710
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,233
Back home. I cut meat.
I do it damn fine too.

711
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,278
Did it in high school,
did it after high school.

712
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:46,614
I could cut you a piece of meat
so clean....

713
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:49,367
....it'll have you praying
to beefsteak.

714
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:54,372
I'm a good butcher, Bozz.
It's all I ever wanted to be.

715
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,713
You laughing at me ?

716
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,300
No, Miter. I ain't laughing at you.

717
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:10,889
My wife, she laughed at me.
My daddy too.

718
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,724
I didn't make no money.

719
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:15,477
Just a store boy,
that's what my daddy said.

720
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,771
"Hey, store boy. Hey, boy ! "

721
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:22,692
Called me boy. Imagine that ? Shit
kicker, calling me boy all the time.

722
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,861
I ain't a boy, goddamn it !

723
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,781
Telling me how he's
a big fancy war hero !

724
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,033
And my wife, that little-

725
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,246
My wife.

726
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:43,963
She's pretty.

727
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:47,092
Prettiest girl in Lake Charles High.

728
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,518
Prettiest girl
in the state of Louisiana.

729
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:03,233
She was mad at me because
I was working all the time.

730
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,318
Giving her the money....

731
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,237
....for junior college.

732
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:10,532
I knowed then, like....

733
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,243
....Iike I knowed later on....

734
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,997
....she was seeing a fucking
college boy on the side !

735
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:19,958
Goddamn it ! My daddy said it.

736
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,212
He said, "See ? See what a dumb-ass
bastard you are ?

737
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,881
Blinded by the beaver store, boy.

738
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:30,176
You ought to have a little ring
in your nose. "

739
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:34,556
So you thought you'd join the Army
and kill yourself like a real man.

740
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:39,310
Bozz, I know you can get people out.

741
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,354
Maybe.

742
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:45,316
Even in this wild-ass nonsense,
some rules fly by.

743
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:50,530
Please, Bozz. Please get me
out of here. Please ?

744
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:12,260
Well, look here.

745
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:13,720
Goddamn.

746
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:18,183
That captain sure didn't want
to let me go at first.

747
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,809
But I did like you said.

748
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:22,687
Told him the Army wants me
to see a psychiatrist.

749
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:26,649
- And that was it, huh ?
- I wanted to thank you personally.

750
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,151
Doctor sent me on leave.

751
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:31,738
He'll contact the Red Cross,
get me out-processed....

752
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,573
....so I don't have to come back.

753
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,826
Good, Miter. Glad to hear
you're nuts, man.

754
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,123
- Best of luck, Miter.
- Thanks, Paxton.

755
00:50:42,374 --> 00:50:45,585
- Miter.
- Take care, Johnson.

756
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,340
Thanks again, Bozz.

757
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,846
- So long.
 Go be a butcher, Miter !

758
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:00,809
- Try not to get shot, hear ?
- Don't let your meat loaf, man.

759
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:11,444
Yeah, fuck you.

760
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,998
- Private Bozz, reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

761
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:27,127
So you're the new platoon
guide for 2nd Platoon ?

762
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:28,253
Yes, sir.

763
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:31,214
The fucking world is full
of fucking surprises.

764
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:34,342
It wasn't your plan to wear
sergeant's stripes....

765
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,845
....a week away from
Tigerland in a war.

766
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:40,473
I don't know, sir. The idea
crossed my mind now and again.

767
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:43,810
I just didn't think it would
all be so pitiful sad.

768
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:51,443
Been looking over your 201.

769
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:53,611
You're a Texas boy.

770
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:57,615
Couple run-ins with the law.
A year in state college.

771
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:59,451
Dropout, worked construction.

772
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:01,453
- Get drafted ?
- Yes, sir.

773
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:06,666
- Why didn't you stay in school ?
- Maybe I needed some trouble, sir.

774
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,418
Well, you got it.

775
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:13,048
You also got responsibility.
You got a platoon to run.

776
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:17,385
The company's like the bad end of a
shit storm. Your platoon's the worst.

777
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:21,097
- Thank you, sir.
- That's not a compliment, smart-ass.

778
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,810
I don't want any more calls
from battalion....

779
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:28,396
....asking me why this troopie needs
a hardship discharge....

780
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:31,566
....and that troopie needs
some kind of a mental wet nurse.

781
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,818
- You understand me ?
- Yes, sir.

782
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:36,780
Wipe that fucking grin off your face.

783
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,619
A week from now you'll ship out
to Tigerland.

784
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:45,830
That'll crawl in your skull
and look out your eyes.

785
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,957
So let's start fresh.

786
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:51,086
- Give your people a weekend pass.
- Already done it, sir.

787
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:59,511
You are a goddamn piece of work, Bozz.

788
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:04,015
I believe you could soldier as well
as any man in this army.

789
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,018
I even think you want to,
but you won't.

790
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,355
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.

791
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:16,361
We're fighting a war, private. Nobody
knows how he's gonna come back.

792
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:20,532
That's not the kind of alive
I'm talking about, sir.

793
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,450
Here's 150 bucks.

794
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,925
Happy Halloween !

795
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:42,721
Cough it up, Brian.

796
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:44,180
Next time, Pax.

797
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:46,224
- Catch you later, buddy.
- AII right.

798
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:57,485
Who's that girl you're
talking to, Bozz ?

799
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:02,073
- Trying to score some weed.
- Know what I don't get ?

800
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,493
Why they haven't tossed you
out on some lunatic discharge....

801
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:07,996
-....some bullshit like that.
- I ain't crazy.

802
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:10,206
You're out of your fucking mind.

803
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:14,336
My reasons are my reasons and
no one has to like them.

804
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:17,505
What about these fucking war games ?
What if it's a lie ?

805
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,842
What if the guys who tell you and me
shit to do were lied to also ?

806
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:25,096
Maybe since everyone believes
in the same mistake, you know....

807
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:27,474
....maybe they're all as confused
as we are.

808
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:30,852
AII this "Boy's boy,
man's man" bullshit.

809
00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:32,645
Ever feel you're just being stupid ?

810
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:36,733
Yeah. And it gives me a warm,
gooey feeling inside too.

811
00:54:55,043 --> 00:54:57,462
Oh, man, we need women, Pax !

812
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:02,842
We need song and prayers to the moon
and deep breaths of the night wind.

813
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:04,386
Oh, I hear you, buddy !

814
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:07,597
I hear your asshole's tighter
than a migraine.

815
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,849
- Fuck you !
 Hey, man.

816
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:12,977
- You're Bozz, right ?
- Uh-huh.

817
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:17,899
Fellas say that if you don't
want to go to Nam....

818
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:21,319
....you better pray to Jesus
or talk to Roland Bozz.

819
00:55:21,528 --> 00:55:24,656
- Better start praying to Jesus, then.
- Sorry, kid !

820
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:27,158
- Oh, my God, look here.
- Oh, Jesus !

821
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,869
- I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble !
- You are !

822
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,956
- Come here, baby.
- I'll come if you got some money.

823
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:36,251
- I might have some money.
- You might or you do ?

824
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:39,379
- You better have some.
- That's what I need to see.

825
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,381
- You want to see it ?
- Yeah, I do.

826
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,842
- You got me covered, right ?
- Here it is.

827
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:48,013
As I was about to come, I let
out a fart. Should've seen her face.

828
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:51,433
Heard it in the next room.
Thought a grenade went off.

829
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,643
- How was yours ?
- Expensive.

830
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,021
- You feel guilty ?
- Because I'm broke ?

831
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:59,691
I figured you for a guy
who left a sweetheart back home.

832
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:02,360
- She left me.
- That's why you joined the Army.

833
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:06,239
- Go on, confess.
- No, she broke it off when I enlisted.

834
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:09,242
- Didn't want to be a widow.
- She's got a point.

835
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:11,161
After all this bullshit....

836
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:14,914
....you still want to go kill women
and children in rice paddies ?

837
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:19,627
- Come on, Paxton !
- Where you going, Bozz ?

838
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:22,005
- I have no idea.
- Fuck.

839
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:26,468
- We are gonna jump, my young friend !
- Shit, Bozz, I'm too drunk.

840
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:29,304
- Come on, Paxton.
- I'll break my neck.

841
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:32,015
I don't want to go without you,
man.

842
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:34,517
AII right, I see what this is.

843
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:37,812
This jump, it's like this
existential leap of faith.

844
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:40,357
Abso-fucking-lutely.
I have no idea what that means.

845
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:42,859
We'll break those legs
and get out of the war.

846
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:45,528
- Okay, let's go.
- That's it, here we go.

847
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,447
- I'm ready.
- That's it.

848
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:51,034
It's gonna be on my count.
It'll be one, two, three.

849
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:53,328
- Let's break those legs.
- Okay, one !

850
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:54,746
Two !

851
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:56,414
Three !

852
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:00,377
- Was that the count ?
- That was the count.

853
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:04,964
- Okay, okay.
- Here we go, here we go.

854
00:57:05,173 --> 00:57:07,801
- Hot girl.
- Oh, yeah, hot girl.

855
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:10,095
On my count again, one, two, three.

856
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:12,430
Okay, one !

857
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,140
Two !

858
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:15,809
Three !

859
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:20,563
The legs won't move. Shit.

860
00:57:20,939 --> 00:57:24,984
They're out for themselves.
Goddamn it.

861
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:34,786
If that bottle was a leg, we'd be
out of the war about now.

862
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:40,000
- Looks like that would really hurt.
- Oh, fuck.

863
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:52,053
Canadian Atlantic Railway.
There's your ride out of here, Bozz.

864
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:56,224
Go to Canada and live with
a fucking moose ? No way, man.

865
00:57:56,474 --> 00:58:00,228
Mexico, that's where I'd disappear to.
Can't you just smell it ?

866
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,064
See it ? Shit, I can
smell it from here.

867
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:08,153
AII that sunshine and tequila. AII
those little senoritas walking around.

868
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:12,949
- Would you- ?
- What ?

869
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:16,327
If I told you about people
who can get us to Mexico....

870
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,788
....away from the war, would you go ?

871
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:21,708
No.

872
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:24,794
No, I wouldn't.

873
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,173
I enlisted, so there's a place for me.

874
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:31,384
If I don't go, somebody
has to take that place.

875
00:58:33,178 --> 00:58:34,804
And if they die, well....

876
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,557
....they're dying for me.

877
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:41,728
You're a brave man.

878
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:45,690
- You're the brave one, Bozz.
- Bullshit.

879
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:51,946
Courage is when you're the only guy
who knows how shit-scared you are.

880
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:55,075
Then you're right.

881
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:57,160
I am the brave one.

882
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:01,331
Let's get out of here.
We gotta get back.

883
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:04,876
Fucking Sergeant Thomas
will chew my ass for chow !

884
00:59:12,801 --> 00:59:16,971
- Anytime today, Private Paxton.
- I'm coming, Private Bozz.

885
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:19,265
Fuck.

886
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:25,313
We should have jumped.

887
00:59:25,522 --> 00:59:26,773
Yeah.

888
00:59:27,399 --> 00:59:29,067
We can always go back.

889
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,986
Come on, man.

890
01:00:10,692 --> 01:00:11,818
Fight !

891
01:00:12,986 --> 01:00:16,823
Calm the fuck down here !
Calm the fuck down !

892
01:00:17,282 --> 01:00:19,993
- Calm down.
 Get him, Bozz !

893
01:00:21,745 --> 01:00:23,496
Get him, Bozz, get him !

894
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:04,579
Let him go ! You're gonna
hurt him, Bozz, let him go !

895
01:01:04,913 --> 01:01:06,164
Let him go, Bozz !

896
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:09,918
Let him go ! Come on ! Get off !
Goddamn it !

897
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:25,058
Damn you, Paxton. Let them fight.

898
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:26,810
Shut the fuck up.

899
01:01:27,018 --> 01:01:29,396
You know he deserved every bit of it !

900
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,823
Took four hours for
my nose to stop bleeding.

901
01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:42,325
Get off it, Wilson !
You had it coming, man !

902
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:46,079
- I was just fucking with him.
- If Paxton here had kept quiet....

903
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:49,249
....boy, you'd be in hell right now,
sure as shit !

904
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:54,045
If I knew Bozz would stop,
I wouldn't have said anything.

905
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:56,631
Apologize, Bozz.

906
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:57,924
Get off it.

907
01:01:58,133 --> 01:01:59,592
You heard me, Bozz.

908
01:02:00,427 --> 01:02:02,721
You apologize to me right now.

909
01:02:03,013 --> 01:02:05,682
Yeah, Bozz. Apologize to the man.

910
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:09,811
Say, "I'm sorry I didn't
kill your ass ! "

911
01:02:12,188 --> 01:02:13,690
Think that's funny ?

912
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:16,735
Fuck.

913
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:21,948
You tried to embarrass me in front
of every fucking person here.

914
01:02:23,074 --> 01:02:24,659
Apologize.

915
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:38,840
Cease firing !

916
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:40,717
Clear your weapons !

917
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,930
Weapons clear.

918
01:02:46,723 --> 01:02:49,267
Next group on the line, let's move !

919
01:02:56,608 --> 01:02:57,984
Next group on the line !

920
01:03:02,113 --> 01:03:03,740
- Weapon safe ?
- Yeah, all clear.

921
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,325
Take a mag.

922
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:09,871
Ready on the right.

923
01:03:11,206 --> 01:03:12,832
Ready on the left.

924
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,335
Firing line is ready.

925
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:17,629
Shooters, prepare to fire !

926
01:03:18,046 --> 01:03:19,506
Fire !

927
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,979
Cease fire ! Clear your weapons !

928
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:38,191
- Weapon clear, Barnes ?
- AII clear, Bozz.

929
01:03:42,028 --> 01:03:45,031
The fuck you doing, Wilson ?
- Killing me a Cong.

930
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:48,201
What the hell's going on ?

931
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,411
Unload that weapon !

932
01:03:49,703 --> 01:03:51,538
Head or the body, Bozz ?
You choose !

933
01:03:51,788 --> 01:03:53,248
Unload that fucking weapon !

934
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,003
- Head or the body ?
 Damn it, unload that piece !

935
01:03:58,253 --> 01:04:01,047
- Fuck you, Bozz.
- Unload that weapon !

936
01:04:01,256 --> 01:04:02,215
Fuck you, Bozz !

937
01:04:03,383 --> 01:04:04,592
Fuck you !

938
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:26,197
It's jammed.

939
01:04:26,865 --> 01:04:29,284
Did you see that ? Did you see that ?

940
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:43,340
Looks like a misfeed jammed it.

941
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:46,468
Well, you are one lucky dick, Bozz.

942
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:49,554
It would've killed you
and the three people next to you.

943
01:04:49,721 --> 01:04:52,766
- Hope you're not too disappointed.
- What do you want to do ?

944
01:04:53,016 --> 01:04:57,062
How about get Wilson as far
the fuck away as possible, sir ?

945
01:04:58,813 --> 01:05:02,108
Well, you have the right to
press for a court-martial.

946
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:05,779
Otherwise, you can let us
handle it our way.

947
01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:08,406
I'd personally prefer that option.

948
01:05:08,615 --> 01:05:12,118
- Consider it a personal favor to me.
- Get Wilson out, sir.

949
01:05:12,494 --> 01:05:15,413
I don't recall telling you
to open your stinkhole.

950
01:05:15,622 --> 01:05:19,000
He's right, sir. Wilson
shouldn't be in the Army.

951
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:21,169
Even if he did try to kill somebody.

952
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:24,631
You and I need to exchange some ideas.

953
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:26,341
That doesn't solve our problem.

954
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:30,261
We need to get him out now
or we'll file for a court-martial.

955
01:05:30,512 --> 01:05:31,763
Paxton, you're dismissed.

956
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:34,391
Yes, sir.

957
01:05:45,026 --> 01:05:46,444
He's learning.

958
01:05:47,612 --> 01:05:51,533
Bozz, do you think the Army's never
seen pissants like you before ?

959
01:05:52,617 --> 01:05:55,537
I know you think you're some
big swinging-dick hero.

960
01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:58,039
I know a lot of the men think so too.

961
01:05:58,248 --> 01:06:01,960
But I know you for what you are.
You are a coward.

962
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:06,339
You're a born leader and you're afraid
to take any real responsibility !

963
01:06:06,589 --> 01:06:09,676
That's why you dropped out of school,
why you drop out of everything !

964
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:11,469
You're pissing your life away !

965
01:06:11,678 --> 01:06:13,388
I don't need the fucking Army....

966
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:16,141
....and I don't need the war
to tell me that, sir !

967
01:06:16,808 --> 01:06:18,059
Get on your feet, soldier.

968
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:20,729
Attention !

969
01:06:22,522 --> 01:06:26,192
I don't want you in a stockade.
I don't want you recycled.

970
01:06:26,401 --> 01:06:29,696
I don't want you drummed out
on some bad conduct discharge.

971
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:34,492
I want you exactly where you are.

972
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,455
And we'll just naturally chew you up.

973
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:46,046
I'll take care of Wilson.
You get the fuck out of my face.

974
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:17,369
Sure glad they got Wilson's ass out.

975
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,746
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

976
01:07:19,996 --> 01:07:22,707
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- You shut the fuck up.

977
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:24,918
- Guys, relax.
- I ain't starting.

978
01:07:25,168 --> 01:07:27,379
You already got your ass beat once.

979
01:07:27,545 --> 01:07:31,466
- Just watch your back in Tigerland.
- I'll do that.

980
01:07:32,759 --> 01:07:36,096
I guess I'm supposed to joke
about how I owe you my life.

981
01:07:36,304 --> 01:07:39,349
- He almost killed you.
- You jealous ?

982
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,726
You wanted to know what it was like.

983
01:07:41,976 --> 01:07:43,269
What what was like ?

984
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,189
The great lesson
of being close to death.

985
01:07:46,439 --> 01:07:47,816
Know what I know ?

986
01:07:48,108 --> 01:07:50,110
Same thing you know.

987
01:07:50,485 --> 01:07:52,195
We're in a real bad way.

988
01:08:14,342 --> 01:08:15,969
Fuck.

989
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:19,347
Real bad way.

990
01:08:19,597 --> 01:08:21,933
AII right ! Let's go ! Move it !

991
01:08:22,183 --> 01:08:23,393
Come on ! Let's go !

992
01:08:23,727 --> 01:08:26,062
- Come on ! Move ! Move !
 Move your ass !

993
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:28,273
Come on, fat boy ! Move your ass !

994
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:30,358
Let's go, soldier !

995
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:37,657
Let's go ! Let's go !

996
01:08:42,078 --> 01:08:43,413
C.O.Welcome to Tigerland !

997
01:08:43,663 --> 01:08:46,666
Your final training
before you're shipped overseas !

998
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,878
Here, everything's done
exactly as it is over there.

999
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:52,756
You will search and destroy,
hunt and kill !

1000
01:08:53,006 --> 01:08:56,301
You'll move by chopper to secure
any area deemed necessary.

1001
01:08:56,509 --> 01:08:58,553
You'll be allowed one hour's sleep.

1002
01:08:58,762 --> 01:09:01,431
Minor mistakes
will pay back major punishment.

1003
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:04,017
Maybe you've heard
we've lost this war.

1004
01:09:04,351 --> 01:09:07,312
Or we've lost the support
of people here at home.

1005
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:09,606
It's too late to
ask those questions.

1006
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:11,733
You're not back on the block.

1007
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:14,611
You're alive in a year,
we'll talk about it.

1008
01:09:14,861 --> 01:09:16,363
When you arrive in Nam....

1009
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:19,616
....it's important to get acclimated
as quickly as you can.

1010
01:09:19,908 --> 01:09:21,951
Remember to think.

1011
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,287
- You understand me ?
- Yes, sergeant !

1012
01:09:24,537 --> 01:09:29,584
What matters now is sharpening your
ability to find and destroy the enemy.

1013
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:31,544
Practice how to stay alive.

1014
01:09:31,795 --> 01:09:35,256
I know what you're thinking.
I've been there myself.

1015
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,385
You're thinking you'll
go somewhere safe.

1016
01:09:38,635 --> 01:09:39,803
You'll luck out.

1017
01:09:40,095 --> 01:09:43,348
Tigerland is where
you stop bullshitting yourself.

1018
01:09:43,598 --> 01:09:47,435
Sarge, you got any advice
on how to stay alive in Vietnam ?

1019
01:09:47,686 --> 01:09:50,438
I do, private. Don't go.
- Right on, right on.

1020
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:53,066
My friend here wants the experience.

1021
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,193
Says he ain't scared.

1022
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:57,320
Well, good luck.

1023
01:09:57,529 --> 01:10:01,199
If you ask me, I'll stick
with the smart and the scared.

1024
01:10:01,408 --> 01:10:06,371
You'll be under the care of NCOs
and officers who were in combat.

1025
01:10:06,663 --> 01:10:08,248
Listen to them.

1026
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:11,710
They know what they're talking about.
Cota.

1027
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:14,754
I'm Staff Sergeant Cota.

1028
01:10:15,005 --> 01:10:16,965
I've done two tours in Vietnam.

1029
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:19,843
My first in '67 with the 101 st.

1030
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:23,096
Ijust completed my second with MAC-V.

1031
01:10:23,346 --> 01:10:26,141
I only have two words
of advice for you.

1032
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:28,101
And those are to listen... 

1033
01:10:28,518 --> 01:10:29,811
... and to learn.

1034
01:10:30,979 --> 01:10:33,231
AII right, let's saddle up.

1035
01:10:34,065 --> 01:10:36,151
Let's go ! Let's saddle up !

1036
01:10:36,401 --> 01:10:37,902
Let's go, goddamn it !

1037
01:10:41,948 --> 01:10:43,616
Get down !

1038
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:46,327
Good job, Paxton. Good job.

1039
01:10:46,578 --> 01:10:48,163
Good job, Johnson.

1040
01:10:48,371 --> 01:10:49,456
AII right.

1041
01:10:49,706 --> 01:10:51,624
Get your ass behind that tree !

1042
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:55,712
Fantastic. You guys move
like fucking soldiers !

1043
01:10:56,212 --> 01:10:58,173
Get your ass down !

1044
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:00,884
Ryan, get your ass down !

1045
01:11:01,176 --> 01:11:03,303
Go ! Move ! Move !

1046
01:11:03,595 --> 01:11:06,139
Bozz, keep that barrel
out of the dirt !

1047
01:11:06,348 --> 01:11:07,599
Move, move, move !

1048
01:11:07,807 --> 01:11:10,101
Paxton, why are you slowing up ?

1049
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,770
Get your ass down !

1050
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:14,356
You are the weak link !

1051
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:17,108
This is not the time to slow up.

1052
01:11:17,317 --> 01:11:19,194
Adapt ! Overcome !

1053
01:11:19,444 --> 01:11:21,112
Move ! Get in there !

1054
01:11:22,489 --> 01:11:23,531
You good ?

1055
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,575
Why were you slow, Paxton ?

1056
01:11:25,825 --> 01:11:28,661
- Are you hurt ?
- No, I'm fine, sergeant.

1057
01:11:39,881 --> 01:11:41,549
Diagonal, Private Barnes.

1058
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:44,803
- So you don't chop your knee off.
- Yes, sergeant.

1059
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:53,269
Go ahead, Paxton.
I gotta take a piss.

1060
01:11:54,354 --> 01:11:56,189
- You okay ?
- Yeah.

1061
01:12:54,414 --> 01:12:57,459
"Jim Paxton
on personal guide to pain. "

1062
01:12:59,836 --> 01:13:03,840
Get that fucking torch out of my face
and put that cigarette out.

1063
01:13:04,049 --> 01:13:07,177
You might as well
hang a big neon sign that says:

1064
01:13:07,385 --> 01:13:09,512
"Dumb-fuck grunts, right here. "

1065
01:13:09,804 --> 01:13:12,724
You broke light discipline.
Therefore, you're dead.

1066
01:13:12,974 --> 01:13:15,018
- Do you understand ?
 Yes.

1067
01:13:15,226 --> 01:13:18,146
- Good.
 I'm still alive, sergeant.

1068
01:13:18,521 --> 01:13:21,691
- What did you say ?
- I said, I'm still alive.

1069
01:13:22,192 --> 01:13:25,236
I miraculously survived the attack.

1070
01:13:25,612 --> 01:13:27,530
- You didn't get hit ?
- No.

1071
01:13:27,739 --> 01:13:29,115
Are your friends alive ?

1072
01:13:29,366 --> 01:13:32,327
Yeah, Paxton's good.
Johnson, he's good and he's good.

1073
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:36,081
If you're gonna make up a story,
make up a happy one.

1074
01:13:36,956 --> 01:13:39,167
I ain't making anything up, son.

1075
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:45,799
And in Vietnam there are no
happy fucking stories.

1076
01:13:52,555 --> 01:13:55,475
I had a best buddy, Kelly Morgan....

1077
01:13:55,767 --> 01:13:58,812
....that I went to AIT with.

1078
01:14:00,772 --> 01:14:04,609
In'67, when the call came,
we got sent off to Nam.

1079
01:14:05,235 --> 01:14:09,864
We had only been in country
a few days. We was green as grass.

1080
01:14:11,157 --> 01:14:15,286
We were in a two-man listening post,
talking just like we are here.

1081
01:14:15,954 --> 01:14:18,206
Kelly lit up a cigarette.

1082
01:14:19,082 --> 01:14:21,793
One minute we're naming
his unborn child....

1083
01:14:22,002 --> 01:14:25,672
....and the next second
his brains were in my lap.

1084
01:14:37,726 --> 01:14:41,396
The sniper zeroed in
on the cherry of his cigarette, Bozz.

1085
01:14:46,026 --> 01:14:49,654
Gentlemen, it's all about respect.

1086
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:54,451
Respect for your superiors
and what they're trying to teach you.

1087
01:14:55,744 --> 01:14:59,080
Respect for yourselves and your unit.

1088
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,834
And most important....

1089
01:15:04,294 --> 01:15:06,171
....respect the enemy.

1090
01:15:11,843 --> 01:15:14,095
You have 42 minutes....

1091
01:15:14,346 --> 01:15:16,973
....then the squad's on patrol.

1092
01:15:22,228 --> 01:15:23,480
Fuck.

1093
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:34,949
Gentlemen, this is the best Vietnamese
village we could create for you....

1094
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,409
....here on the base !

1095
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:40,705
Now, listen. You're all gooks,
so nobody speaks English.

1096
01:15:40,914 --> 01:15:44,626
Anybody asks you a question
in English, you answer, "No bic. "

1097
01:15:44,918 --> 01:15:47,420
It means, "I don't speak" in gook-ese.
Let's hear it.

1098
01:15:47,671 --> 01:15:48,672
No bic.

1099
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,467
Good. Private Bozz, you are
the only man that speaks English.

1100
01:15:52,759 --> 01:15:57,806
Speak only to the man who identifies
himself as interpreter. Understood ?

1101
01:15:58,014 --> 01:15:59,808
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Private Paxton.

1102
01:16:00,058 --> 01:16:01,518
You are the Vietcong.

1103
01:16:01,768 --> 01:16:06,439
They come through, their objective
is to find the VC sympathizer.

1104
01:16:06,648 --> 01:16:09,192
In other words, you, Private Paxton.

1105
01:16:09,442 --> 01:16:11,444
They have five minutes.

1106
01:16:11,653 --> 01:16:14,781
You tell them nothing.

1107
01:16:15,281 --> 01:16:16,908
I warn you, they're beat up.

1108
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:18,993
They've been awake three nights.

1109
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,870
Forced marched all day.

1110
01:16:21,121 --> 01:16:25,208
They fuck this up,
they'll march another six miles.

1111
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:26,710
One other thing:

1112
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,839
They find out
which one of you is VC... 

1113
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:33,758
... and you'll be the ones
out in the boonies... 

1114
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:37,345
... on no sleep, forced marching
for the next two nights.

1115
01:16:37,595 --> 01:16:38,638
Understood ?

1116
01:16:38,888 --> 01:16:40,849
- Yes, sergeant.
- Let's get to work.

1117
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:43,768
Private Bozz, Paxton. Over here.

1118
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:47,480
Lets see...... 
Lukins, Barnes, in this hooch.

1119
01:16:47,814 --> 01:16:50,025
Make it as realistic as possible.

1120
01:16:50,191 --> 01:16:52,527
This is not a fucking joke.

1121
01:16:52,777 --> 01:16:55,280
I like this.
It's like a war theme park.

1122
01:16:55,488 --> 01:16:58,199
I'm so tired. I'm gonna pass out.

1123
01:17:08,918 --> 01:17:11,254
Hey, here they come.

1124
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,136
Shit.

1125
01:17:18,428 --> 01:17:19,679
It's Wilson.

1126
01:17:20,847 --> 01:17:22,098
What ?

1127
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:25,977
- I thought we got him out.
- There's a war going on.

1128
01:17:26,186 --> 01:17:28,605
Plenty of room
for psychopathic killers.

1129
01:17:28,813 --> 01:17:31,358
Let's move it.
We don't got much time.

1130
01:17:31,649 --> 01:17:34,027
We gotta find the VC.

1131
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:38,740
No bic.

1132
01:17:39,407 --> 01:17:41,117
Fuck me.

1133
01:17:43,078 --> 01:17:44,329
- VC ?
- No bic.

1134
01:17:45,955 --> 01:17:48,208
- Get your ass on the ground !
- No bic.

1135
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:50,543
- No bic.
- No bic. No bic.

1136
01:17:52,587 --> 01:17:54,464
Get on the fucking ground !

1137
01:17:55,048 --> 01:17:56,549
- You VC ?
- No bic.

1138
01:17:57,634 --> 01:17:59,010
- You VC ?
- No bic.

1139
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,261
- You VC ?
- No bic.

1140
01:18:00,595 --> 01:18:01,721
How'd that feel ?

1141
01:18:02,013 --> 01:18:06,351
Need an interpreter ?
I'm the only one that speaks English.

1142
01:18:09,354 --> 01:18:11,064
How does that feel, Paxton ?

1143
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:19,698
What are you gonna write about now ?

1144
01:18:24,244 --> 01:18:26,454
What are you writing in your journal ?

1145
01:18:32,544 --> 01:18:33,920
Don't fucking move !

1146
01:18:35,839 --> 01:18:38,216
Let go of him, goddamn it !

1147
01:18:44,973 --> 01:18:48,476
- You're in charge ! On your feet !
- Yes, sergeant.

1148
01:18:48,977 --> 01:18:51,312
Where is your weapon, soldier ?

1149
01:18:51,563 --> 01:18:52,814
There it is.

1150
01:18:53,106 --> 01:18:56,359
Why didn't you secure the area,
Private Wilson ?

1151
01:18:56,901 --> 01:19:00,488
I'll tell you why.
Because you lost control !

1152
01:19:00,739 --> 01:19:02,240
Yes, sergeant.

1153
01:19:03,283 --> 01:19:05,618
Did you find any VC ?

1154
01:19:05,869 --> 01:19:09,748
No, you didn't.
That's the fucking answer.

1155
01:19:10,123 --> 01:19:11,416
Come here.

1156
01:19:13,418 --> 01:19:17,714
I promise you tears before breakfast.
Get your men and get out of here.

1157
01:19:17,922 --> 01:19:20,133
Get out of here ! Let's go. Move !

1158
01:19:20,342 --> 01:19:22,594
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Is that right ?

1159
01:19:23,553 --> 01:19:25,847
- You gonna kill me again ?
- I'll kill you.

1160
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:28,016
Get your hands off him !

1161
01:19:29,476 --> 01:19:31,144
You want to go ?

1162
01:19:31,394 --> 01:19:33,980
Get the fuck out of here !

1163
01:19:38,026 --> 01:19:40,403
- Get the fuck out !
- I'll break your neck !

1164
01:19:40,737 --> 01:19:43,198
- Let's move !
 Get the fuck out of here !

1165
01:19:43,448 --> 01:19:45,116
Somebody grab my steel pot.

1166
01:19:45,367 --> 01:19:47,035
Get out of here.

1167
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:49,412
- How you doing ?
- Shit.

1168
01:19:49,662 --> 01:19:51,081
Is he all right ?

1169
01:19:51,331 --> 01:19:52,665
No, he's not all right.

1170
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:55,210
Take your time.

1171
01:21:00,817 --> 01:21:02,861
- You going ?
 I can't take you with me.

1172
01:21:03,153 --> 01:21:05,613
Not me. Paxton. He's hurting.

1173
01:21:05,864 --> 01:21:06,906
He signed up.

1174
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:08,825
And you judged him for it.

1175
01:21:09,034 --> 01:21:12,120
You even made me feel guilty
and I was drafted.

1176
01:21:16,124 --> 01:21:18,835
You saw what Wilson did to him today.

1177
01:21:20,795 --> 01:21:22,172
He's broken down.

1178
01:21:22,339 --> 01:21:25,175
And the Army didn't do
all the breaking. Take him.

1179
01:21:25,383 --> 01:21:28,511
It's not my fault if he
just realized what he did.

1180
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:31,139
I only got time for my sad story.

1181
01:21:31,348 --> 01:21:33,850
- Take him with you.
- Fuck off !

1182
01:21:34,059 --> 01:21:36,770
Wilson's gonna take
his hate out on somebody.

1183
01:21:36,978 --> 01:21:41,733
You run, he'll kill Paxton.
If not here, for sure over in Nam.

1184
01:21:42,025 --> 01:21:44,152
Johnson, I like you, but fuck off.

1185
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,781
Yeah, well,
I ain't standing in your way.

1186
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:45,338
Rise and shine, gentlemen !

1187
01:22:45,547 --> 01:22:47,507
Let's go, gentlemen ! Roll'em !

1188
01:22:47,757 --> 01:22:50,593
Let's go ! Move ! Get on your feet !

1189
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:55,390
I know you're tired, but you'll be
doing a lot of this in the next year !

1190
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,058
If you're not....

1191
01:22:57,183 --> 01:23:00,145
-....then you're in a body bag.
- Where's Bozz ?

1192
01:23:00,353 --> 01:23:03,106
Waiting for a dust-off.

1193
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:06,192
Where is your squad leader ?

1194
01:23:06,651 --> 01:23:08,361
Is this his weapon ?

1195
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:11,448
Does anybody know
where your squad leader is ?

1196
01:23:11,698 --> 01:23:13,074
Where is he, Johnson ?

1197
01:23:19,622 --> 01:23:23,084
- Where is your weapon, Private Bozz ?
- Right here, sarge.

1198
01:23:23,293 --> 01:23:24,544
I know that.

1199
01:23:24,794 --> 01:23:28,465
The next time you decide
to take a piss or a fucking shit....

1200
01:23:28,715 --> 01:23:30,759
....you make sure you have your weapon.

1201
01:23:31,051 --> 01:23:34,387
Your weapon is your lifeline.
Why didn't you have it ?

1202
01:23:34,596 --> 01:23:38,183
I was gonna make a break for Mexico.
I didn't think I'd need it.

1203
01:23:38,433 --> 01:23:39,851
Very funny.

1204
01:23:40,685 --> 01:23:42,354
You take point.

1205
01:23:42,896 --> 01:23:46,858
Paxton, take slack. Johnson, drag.
The rest of you fall in behind.

1206
01:23:47,108 --> 01:23:48,360
Listen up.

1207
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:52,113
You'll square off
against the boys from yesterday.

1208
01:23:52,364 --> 01:23:54,074
They may have booby traps.

1209
01:23:54,491 --> 01:23:56,785
They may have forward observers
watching.

1210
01:23:57,077 --> 01:24:00,246
They may do all manner of shit
that you don't know.

1211
01:24:00,497 --> 01:24:05,418
That's why you will keep
your eyes open and your mouths shut.

1212
01:24:05,794 --> 01:24:09,005
- Is that fucking understood ?
- Yes, sarge.

1213
01:24:10,965 --> 01:24:12,175
Let's move out.

1214
01:24:14,886 --> 01:24:18,515
- Welcome back.
- You owe me 150 bucks.

1215
01:24:23,019 --> 01:24:25,480
Hurry up, Paxton. Let's go.

1216
01:24:54,467 --> 01:24:56,803
Dixie, dixie, my 12.

1217
01:24:57,053 --> 01:24:58,513
Dixie, my 12.

1218
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,769
Move it ! Come on !

1219
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,196
You okay ?

1220
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:46,973
Fuck, Bozz. Joke's over.
Can't you see we're fucked ?

1221
01:27:47,223 --> 01:27:49,726
Relax. You'll be fine.

1222
01:27:49,976 --> 01:27:51,728
You'll be fine.

1223
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:02,906
Psst, psst, psst.

1224
01:28:28,264 --> 01:28:31,768
Wilson, what the hell are you doing ?
That's live ammo.

1225
01:29:28,241 --> 01:29:30,118
Ambush ! 12:00 !

1226
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:38,084
Live ammo !

1227
01:29:41,087 --> 01:29:43,673
Cease fire ! Cease fire !

1228
01:30:03,651 --> 01:30:04,903
Fuck !

1229
01:30:06,029 --> 01:30:07,322
Private Wilson !

1230
01:30:07,822 --> 01:30:09,741
Private-fucking-Wilson !

1231
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:12,577
Private Wilson, look at me, goddamn it !

1232
01:30:12,952 --> 01:30:14,996
Oh, Jesus Christ !

1233
01:30:17,123 --> 01:30:18,208
Look at me.

1234
01:30:18,416 --> 01:30:20,669
You will place your weapon on safe !

1235
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:24,381
You will raise your weapon
above your fucking head....

1236
01:30:24,631 --> 01:30:27,050
....or I'll blow
your fucking brains out !

1237
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,136
Oh, Jesus !

1238
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,097
Do it !

1239
01:30:35,183 --> 01:30:37,018
On your fucking knees, now !

1240
01:30:37,268 --> 01:30:38,853
Get on your fucking knees !

1241
01:30:39,854 --> 01:30:43,483
You will be court-martialed !
Do you fucking hear me ?

1242
01:30:47,278 --> 01:30:49,447
What happened ?
- An accident. My fault.

1243
01:30:50,949 --> 01:30:52,325
- Let me look.
- Oh, fuck !

1244
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:57,539
Get him up.

1245
01:31:10,427 --> 01:31:12,554
Let me see the eye.

1246
01:31:13,596 --> 01:31:16,307
I miss my mama

1247
01:31:16,599 --> 01:31:19,644
I miss my woman and kid

1248
01:31:20,353 --> 01:31:22,355
I think about all the things

1249
01:31:22,605 --> 01:31:24,315
From way back when

1250
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:26,276
Sing it, boy.

1251
01:31:27,235 --> 01:31:30,238
I miss my grandma's apple pie

1252
01:31:30,447 --> 01:31:34,242
Shit, I miss getting high

1253
01:31:34,576 --> 01:31:38,663
And my Uncle Sam is sending me to die

1254
01:31:38,913 --> 01:31:40,582
You know what now ?

1255
01:31:40,874 --> 01:31:44,127
He got me looking for Charlie

1256
01:31:44,377 --> 01:31:47,547
And I don't know who he is

1257
01:31:54,763 --> 01:31:58,350
I used to have a Cadillac

1258
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,186
I left it back home

1259
01:32:01,436 --> 01:32:03,938
Shit, I left my woman

1260
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:06,775
Still can hear her moan

1261
01:32:08,443 --> 01:32:11,404
Is so much misery

1262
01:32:11,654 --> 01:32:14,908
Up here in Charlie Company

1263
01:32:15,492 --> 01:32:18,912
I wonder if I die
Will they still remember me ?

1264
01:32:19,162 --> 01:32:23,083
Let's go, move it !
This war is not gonna last forever !

1265
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:25,794
Bozz, bus number three !

1266
01:32:26,044 --> 01:32:28,922
You don't want to miss this war !
Let's go !

1267
01:32:29,172 --> 01:32:30,840
Hey ! Bozz.

1268
01:32:32,884 --> 01:32:36,221
- Want to come along ?
- I did, but you wouldn't let me.

1269
01:32:37,305 --> 01:32:38,473
How's your eye ?

1270
01:32:40,141 --> 01:32:44,437
Got an injury bad enough to get out,
no permanent damage. Imagine that.

1271
01:32:44,646 --> 01:32:46,481
More corny wisdom for your book.

1272
01:32:46,731 --> 01:32:49,818
"In the country of the blind,
the one-eyed man is king. "

1273
01:32:50,443 --> 01:32:53,279
Pretty fancy shooting, Tex.
Thank you.

1274
01:32:54,322 --> 01:32:57,575
It was just luck, Jim.
I could have killed you.

1275
01:32:58,076 --> 01:32:59,744
No, it wasn't.

1276
01:33:01,079 --> 01:33:03,248
Somebody had to take your place.

1277
01:33:03,456 --> 01:33:04,332
Bozz !

1278
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:07,127
Last chance.
Don't make me bring the war to you.

1279
01:33:08,586 --> 01:33:10,338
Write me when you get there.

1280
01:33:11,172 --> 01:33:12,924
This is it, man.

1281
01:33:13,174 --> 01:33:15,218
No more phony Army buddy crap.

1282
01:33:23,101 --> 01:33:24,769
Go home.

1283
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:27,272
Live a long time.

1284
01:33:28,398 --> 01:33:30,567
Try not to be too much of an asshole.

1285
01:33:32,318 --> 01:33:34,988
I'm gonna write
a whole book about this.

1286
01:33:35,447 --> 01:33:37,115
Tell everyone about you.

1287
01:33:37,991 --> 01:33:38,992
Paxton.

1288
01:33:41,077 --> 01:33:42,579
Sergeant Thomas....

1289
01:33:42,829 --> 01:33:44,998
....sorry for my misbehavior earlier.

1290
01:33:49,377 --> 01:33:50,628
Real sorry.

1291
01:34:01,097 --> 01:34:03,058
See you back here. Take care.

1292
01:34:03,266 --> 01:34:04,851
- Watch your back.
 See you.

1293
01:34:05,101 --> 01:34:09,230
- I'll write a book about you, Bozz !
- No, you won't.

1294
01:34:09,481 --> 01:34:12,108
Come on, quit playing.
That's my journal.

1295
01:34:12,317 --> 01:34:14,861
Jesus ! Bozz !

1296
01:34:15,403 --> 01:34:18,156
Come on, quit fucking around.
That's my book !

1297
01:34:19,449 --> 01:34:21,284
What are you doing ? Shit !

1298
01:34:21,576 --> 01:34:23,787
Stop the bus !

1299
01:34:25,914 --> 01:34:28,833
Oh, Bozz, what is this shit ?

1300
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,764
I never saw Bozz again.

1301
01:34:44,099 --> 01:34:46,601
Some guys said he died in Nam... 

1302
01:34:46,893 --> 01:34:48,812
... but he was never listed.

1303
01:34:50,105 --> 01:34:52,774
Some said he just
disappeared over there.

1304
01:34:53,149 --> 01:34:56,361
One guy called and said
he thought he saw him in Mexico... 

1305
01:34:56,611 --> 01:34:58,405
... with a beautiful woman.

1306
01:34:59,823 --> 01:35:01,533
But knowing Bozz... 

1307
01:35:01,741 --> 01:35:05,078
... he'd be pissed off
I was talking about him anyway.
