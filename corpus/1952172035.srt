2
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:16,756
(Horse whinnies)

3
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:29,787
Come on, Gunner.

4
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,857
Let's go.

5
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,103
(Horse whinnies)

6
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,660
What is wrong with you?

7
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:39,732
Easy.

8
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:54,388
(Horse whinnies)

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,976
(Helicopter whirs)

10
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:10,141
Girl in a culvert pipe
at a highway construction site...

11
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,983
in the middle of an alfalfa field.

12
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:19,111
You got anything to add?

13
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:21,180
Nothing as poetic.

14
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:23,989
Just... Road crew took off at 3 o'clock.

15
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:26,052
Body was discovered at 5:15.

16
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:27,719
Who found the body?

17
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,030
Our friend Flicka.

18
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:31,905
Well, there goes that theory.

19
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:35,307
- What's that?
- Whoever finds the body is the first suspect.

20
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,036
Grissom!

21
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,888
What you got?

22
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,617
The one thing you don't want
at a murder scene.

23
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,591
A second body.

24
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,285
Who would you like to start with?

25
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,355
Which one died first?

26
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,830
Identical body temps in vitreous humour.

27
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:35,918
Both women died approximately 12 hours ago.

28
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:39,293
My Uncle Phil used to say
you can't kill two birds with one stone.

29
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,402
All I can tell you is cause of death.

30
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,711
Injury to the cervical spine.

31
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,781
Looks to be hands-on.

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,873
Somebody snapped her neck.

33
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,503
She died instantly.

34
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:55,565
Now the blonde.

35
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:59,586
Contusion to the forehead. Not fatal.

36
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:01,655
Whatever cut her face, cut her arm.

37
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:05,434
I found glass in all the incised wounds.
Except...

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,788
for these abrasions on her neck.

39
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:10,306
Fingernails, maybe?

40
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:11,887
Possible sign of struggle.

41
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:15,582
I swabbed the abrasions for foreign DNA.
Sent it to the lab.

42
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,246
Cause of death?

43
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:19,879
Severed brachial artery. She bled out.

44
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:22,933
Something doesn't seem right.

45
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:26,702
The brunette.

46
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,287
Elaborate tattoos.

47
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:31,175
Perfectly dyed hair.

48
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,188
Multiple body piercings.

49
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,317
Tells me she craved attention.

50
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:43,386
- Sure.
- The blonde, however...

51
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,110
...seems almost prosaic.

52
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,955
She doesn't even nave pierced ears

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,324
She didn't shave her legs.

54
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,853
A wild flower and a wallflower.

55
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,917
So, besides time of death,

56
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,887
what do our dead flowers have in common?

57
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,568
(Owl hoots)

58
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:25,248
Found his SUV in the turnout after closing,

59
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:27,311
so I scoped out the area.

60
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,382
He should have been wearing his orange vest.

61
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:31,820
Bullet looks like a through-and-through.

62
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,072
He bled out.

63
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,101
Hunting rifle.

64
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,154
Winchester T0.

65
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:47,002
- What are you doing there?
- Checking liver temperature.

66
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:49,198
Estimating time of death

67
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:54,478
Should be a total of five bullets.

68
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,259
Four in the magazine. One in the chamber.

69
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:01,781
All accounted for.

70
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,766
This rifle was never fired

71
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:10,346
88.6. That's 10 degrees below normal.

72
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:12,089
So he died 10 hours ago.

73
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:13,465
That would make it 2pm.

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,393
Nick, Catherine, he's all yours.

75
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:18,543
Thanks, David.

76
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:20,613
OK. Let's see who you are.

77
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,984
Nevada licence.

78
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:37,343
James Jasper

79
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:41,569
- When's hunting season?
- Deer season opened last week.

80
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:45,663
- Record number of permits.
- He should have worn his safety vest.

81
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,925
Hunter lays in wait Spots a deer

82
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,363
- Hunter fires
(Gunshot)

83
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:53,736
Bullet takes off

84
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:56,098
Bullet keeps going until it stops.

85
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:58,163
No bullet in the body.

86
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,619
No bullet in the tree.

87
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:06,412
It's got to be somewhere.

88
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:17,244
Processed the crime scene.

89
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:21,185
- Lots of treads and track s. Nothing salient.
- What about the culverts?

90
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:24,961
I came up empty.
I worked from the victims out till I hit the highway.

91
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,847
Nothing. Nothing to process. No follow-up. Zip.

92
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:32,313
You have something.

93
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:34,421
Print Lab ID'd one of the vics.

94
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,839
Blonde or brunette?

95
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,953
Brunette. Joan Mark s.

96
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,549
At 18, she was booked for felony shoplifting.

97
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,293
Lived at home. We got the address.

98
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:45,459
Warrick grabbed a Uniform.
He's on his way with a warrant.

99
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,963
Catherine!

100
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:13,143
- You find the bullet?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:17,088
But how am I gonna get it out
without damaging it?

102
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,709
You know what the textbook says.

103
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,605
If you're not 100% sure how to collect it,
bring the whole thing in.

104
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,823
Yeah. I'll figure it out.

105
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,966
Thanks a lot.

106
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:44,036
I'll take the driver's side.

107
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,515
1,200 miles, and it's an older model.

108
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,585
Driver doesn't get out much.

109
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,863
Registered to a Donna Mark s.

110
00:08:04,993 --> 00:08:08,075
Could be our blonde. Related to Joan Mark s.

111
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,382
- I'll check with DMV.
- I already did.

112
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:15,908
28 years old. Blonde. Blue eyes. 125Ib.

113
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:17,859
5' 6". Sound familiar?

114
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,150
That's her.

115
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:22,967
Uniform was talking to a neighbour.
Donna is Joan's older sister.

116
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,038
Well...

117
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,899
we know what they have in common now,
don't we? Genetics.

118
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:33,320
House belonged to the mother.
Donna's lived here alone since the mother died.

119
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:37,018
Joan lived in Henderson.
The real action's around back.

120
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:43,191
If the highway was the dump site...
this is the primary.

121
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,043
Makes sense.

122
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:50,128
The blonde's lacerations were filled with glass

123
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,198
She went through that door.

124
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,267
From inside out.

125
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:02,433
To take out one of these doors,
you need some serious momentum.

126
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:06,692
No doubt. I'm gonna collect the glass,
then I'll start with the doorframe.

127
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,760
How are you at solving puzzles?

128
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,118
- You're the puzzle guy.
- I have a hint.

129
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,975
When they cool sheet glass, they lay it out on tin.

130
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:19,074
So the side that kissed up to the tin
will fluoresce under UV.

131
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:21,187
It's still a long two days at the lab.

132
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:24,511
I got some imprints on these blood spots here.

133
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:29,624
Looks like the killer may nave stepped
in Donna's blood

134
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:31,823
Or... maybe her sister stepped in it.

135
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,212
There was blood on Joan Mark s' right shoe.

136
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,841
That would place Joan at the house.

137
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:40,912
And establish a timeline.

138
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,981
If Joan did step in Donna's blood,

139
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:47,291
then Donna was injured and bleeding
while Joan was still walking around.

140
00:10:15,183 --> 00:10:18,542
Sweet-and-sour pork.

141
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:20,614
Smells fresh.

142
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:28,042
More sweet-and-sour.

143
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:30,195
Mostly sour

144
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,246
Single servings in the back. Spoiled.

145
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,324
Family-sized boxes...

146
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,440
...in front.

147
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:40,506
One or two days old.

148
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:47,128
What do you think? Increase in appetite or...

149
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:49,193
perhaps a guest?

150
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,366
Universal remote.

151
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:21,667
She could do everything she wanted
from this chair but cook a roast.

152
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:23,740
We already know she cooks like I do.

153
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,648
Takeout on speed dial.

154
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,683
Pottery Barn.

155
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,748
Lillian Vernon. Magnolia.

156
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,930
Yafa Pen.

157
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:34,174
She's a catalogue junkie.
We're on the same mailing lists.

158
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:37,063
Catalogues... the internet.

159
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,126
Mail order.

160
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:41,519
Takeout. 1,200 miles on her car.

161
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:44,890
Agoraphobic, maybe?

162
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,684
Or...

163
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:50,745
- she just doesn't like people?
- Ah, that's you talking.

164
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:55,203
I'll haul in her PC. Check her e-mail.

165
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,076
Look in on her social life.

166
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,660
Hey...

167
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,892
the toilet seat's up.

168
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:11,846
There was a man here.

169
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,343
Nick.

170
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:22,847
- Tell me what you got.
- Coroner said it's cut and dry.

171
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:25,818
- Bullet severed an abdominal artery.
- Trajectory?

172
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:30,525
Front to back. Round entered
an inch to the right of the umbilicus.

173
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:34,091
Bullet's with Ballistics. Vega's got the widow.

174
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:35,308
They're ready for us.

175
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,523
Jimmy left early. Before I got up.

176
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:40,669
When he didn't come home for dinner,

177
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,432
I just figured that he got himself a deer.

178
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,500
Did he go by himself?

179
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,343
He took a day off of work
in the middle of the week?

180
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:52,073
Well... um... we had both been laid off recently.

181
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,677
He was in insurance.

182
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:58,165
He... he was an auditor.

183
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,074
How was your husband handling that?

184
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:02,802
Oh, you know, he was OK.

185
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,823
I mean... er...

186
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:07,713
we had to borrow money
from his folks to pay the rent.

187
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,775
That was hard on him.

188
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:12,169
I have to call them. I haven't called them.

189
00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:13,803
- I...
- Mrs Jasper...

190
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,638
was your husband an experienced hunter?

191
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:18,706
Yes.

192
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,776
Since he was a kid.

193
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:23,910
He always looked forward to deer season.

194
00:13:25,374 --> 00:13:27,312
But... with the baby an' all...

195
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,384
he missed the last few.

196
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:31,454
It's me...

197
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:33,847
isn't it?

198
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:36,894
I encouraged him to go.

199
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:41,284
I thought that it would help him
take his mind off things.

200
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,880
What am I gonna do?

201
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:57,482
Can you think of any reason
James wasn't wearing his safety vest?

202
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:59,546
No.

203
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:04,059
I mean, he was always... so careful.

204
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:07,023
It doesn't sound right.

205
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:12,010
If you're here about the blood
on Joan Mark s' shoe,

206
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,513
I already told Sara.

207
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:15,304
Backed up.

208
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:18,026
I'm here about foreign DNA
on Donna Mark s' neck.

209
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,611
Oh... well, on that, I got an ID.

210
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,660
You found a match in CODIS?

211
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,296
No, but I ran a DNA profile on both victims.

212
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:28,854
What do all sisters have in common?

213
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:30,925
DNA.

214
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:34,624
You're saying that Donna's sister scratched her?

215
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,963
No!

216
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:37,257
Meow!

217
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:42,177
So... did I solve the case?

218
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:44,242
No, Greg. You didn't.

219
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:46,277
But you've helped.

220
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:54,804
Brass... I heard the database kicked out
a temporary restraining order.

221
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,949
Joan Marks against her old boyfriend.

222
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,358
I'll do you one better.
Gavin Pallard had one against her.

223
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:02,832
- Tit for tat.
- They both filed last month.

224
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:04,904
Hey...

225
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,976
wanna find out why?

226
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,126
Don't mind if I do.

227
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,197
See this?

228
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,944
I didn't get this French kissing.

229
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:15,013
Joanie had a temper

230
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:20,246
Punctuated her sentences with throwing
furniture. Made it hot, you know?

231
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:22,319
We'd break up to make up

232
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:24,517
What about the last time?

233
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:26,710
Look, since the whole TRO business...

234
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,991
...she'd been in my house three times.

235
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:32,467
- Couldn't stay away
- According to you.

236
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:37,865
- When did you see her last?
- Yesterday. Dodged a coffeepot.

237
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,146
- She hit the road.
- What was she driving?

238
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,147
My Thunderbird.
I'd lent it to her and used my bike.

239
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,488
But... you know...

240
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:47,410
I'd like it back now.

241
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,119
When we find it.

242
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:53,054
Did she tell you she was going to her sister's?

243
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,122
No.

244
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,595
Why would she go there? It's oil and water.

245
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,344
Joanie liked action.

246
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:02,961
Real partier. The last party Donna went to
was her third birthday.

247
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,412
What about you?
You been to Donna's house recently?

248
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:08,477
No. Boring.

249
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:12,129
She's always glued to her computer.

250
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,828
Joan thought Donna owed her rent.
The house was in both their names.

251
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:18,546
May I

252
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:20,697
see the bottom of your shoes?

253
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:21,959
Why?

254
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,218
Why not?

255
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,445
(Sighs)

256
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:38,762
I like the shoes.

257
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,993
I like 'em enough to get a warrant.

258
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:45,545
I was just calling you.

259
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,755
- You were?
- I carved your bullet out of that hunk of tree.

260
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,723
You know, a bullet's only this big.
Y'all gave me a pound of redwood.

261
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:55,039
- That's cottonwood.
- You should know.

262
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:56,994
You wanted Nick to chop down the tree.

263
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,544
- I did.
- Tell us about the bullet now.

264
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:01,617
Striations. Lands. Grooves.

265
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:05,396
I find some discoloration on the bullet's tail.
Check it out.

266
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:08,444
An oxidation

267
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:11,165
Yeah. Copper-jacketed. Tail was exposed.

268
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,712
Oxidation takes a lot more than 24 hours.

269
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:16,523
It's definitely older than y'all's crime scene.

270
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,640
How's it going?

271
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,017
We've got the wrong bullet,
but the case seems a write-off.

272
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,241
Nothing says it wasn't a hunting accident.

273
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,799
Insurance policy. A million goes to the widow.

274
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:30,690
She was crying poverty
when she was in the money?

275
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:33,204
There's more. It wasn't purchased by Mr Jasper.

276
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:34,669
She bought it.

277
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,551
Monthly instalments, taken on Mrs Jasper's card.

278
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:42,698
He's in the insurance business
and she buys a policy behind his back.

279
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,463
We've got to find that bullet.

280
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:46,677
Donna Marks was a telecommuter

281
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,152
Liked to shop Mail order Over the phone

282
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:51,998
I retrieved lots of e-mail confirmations

283
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:55,532
If she shopped online,
why did she place orders over the phone?

284
00:18:55,658 --> 00:18:57,483
Need for human contact?

285
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:00,886
- Without physical contact?
- She spent time in chat rooms.

286
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,957
Book clubs. Home crafts.

287
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,027
Collected fountain pens.

288
00:19:05,158 --> 00:19:06,854
Personal e-mails?

289
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:10,791
Only one buddy on her buddy list.

290
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:13,682
- Screen name's Apollo.
- Pull up his most recent.

291
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:16,229
That would be three days ago.

292
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:20,372
(Reads) I know it sounds weird, but...

293
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:22,974
my life began when I first heard your voice.

294
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:26,264
When you said my name, it felt so right.

295
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,328
Did you feel it too?

296
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,674
It's easy to wear your heart on your sleeve
when you're not looking in his eyes.

297
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:40,149
He said her name. So their relationship
must have extended beyond the computer.

298
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,283
So, what do we know about this Apollo?

299
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:46,353
You know that garbage?

300
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:49,972
- Those numbers at the bottom of every e-mail?
- Yean

301
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:54,877
It's actually a unique number that registers
the location of the sender's terminal.

302
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:59,269
- An address?
- Internet protocol address CSI has access

303
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:03,446
Seven different IP addresses
means he used seven different computers.

304
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:05,515
That's strange.

305
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,584
Could be a network.

306
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:13,355
23000 Ganza Avenue, Ely, Nevada.

307
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,078
Western Nevada Correctional Facility

308
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,601
Her Greek god is in the slam.

309
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,780
Like it or not, prison is a business.

310
00:20:25,902 --> 00:20:29,182
The facility is privately owned.
Contract with the state.

311
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,655
Our aim is simple. Customer satisfaction.

312
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:34,548
The key to a successful business.
Word of mouth.

313
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,141
Criminals are cutting deals to get sent here.

314
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,109
I imagine. It's like a theme park.

315
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:43,396
The more guys through the turnstile,
the more money we make.

316
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:46,396
So, as long as I'm in business,
you're in business?

317
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,944
Ker-ching.

318
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,458
(Chatter)

319
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:54,024
Are your inmates allowed to use e-mail
anywhere else but here?

320
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:56,015
Personal computers are prohibited.

321
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:59,633
But they're allowed to surf the web,
send and receive e-mail?

322
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,695
Only at these terminals.
All internet activity is strictly monitored.

323
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:08,517
The blouse comes in Laguna blue, Amazon
green or Tahitian red, our most popular colour.

324
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,589
How would you like that shipped?

325
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,160
UPS? Overnight?

326
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:20,451
Something tells me state funds
aren't your only source of revenue.

327
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:23,990
We have contracts with several retailers.
Perfectly legal.

328
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,344
So, let me get this straight.

329
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:28,572
I receive a catalogue in the mail.

330
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,174
I call a toll-free number to place an order,

331
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:34,547
and I'm giving my personal credit card
information to a...

332
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:36,610
hello-I'm-doing-time/life operator?

333
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:40,551
Once orders are sent to the fulfilment centre,
only the retailer has access.

334
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,910
All right. Let's cut to the chase.
I'm investigating the deaths of two women,

335
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,637
one of whom was having a relationship
with an inmate.

336
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:50,293
I need to speak to him.

337
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:52,245
His e-mail alias is Apollo.

338
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:55,730
- I'll check the log.
- That comes to $ 17493

339
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:58,821
Thank you for calling

340
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:01,546
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

341
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,380
- I can get a warrant.
- It won't do you much good.

342
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:08,723
Mickey Rutledge, aka Apollo,
was released three days ago.

343
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:28,573
Hey.

344
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:30,725
Hey.

345
00:22:30,856 --> 00:22:34,215
- How's the glass puzzle going?
- Still putting it together.

346
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:38,364
I'm just doing a trace on Donna Mark s' clothing
and I came across this fibre.

347
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,831
Look at this cross section.

348
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:43,272
Triangular

349
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,708
That means it can't be clothing fibre.

350
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:47,775
Yeah. Short and coarse.

351
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:49,764
Car upholstery?

352
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:53,463
Yeah, but that still doesn't get us anything.

353
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:57,561
We found the vics near the freeway.
We've been thinking vehicle transport.

354
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:59,628
Well, it's from black upholstery.

355
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,392
What colour was
the boyfriend's Thunderbird?

356
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,459
I'll ask him. And his lawyer.

357
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,416
The blood from his shoe was consistent
with Donna Mark s' DNA. He was at the house.

358
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:11,482
Really?

359
00:23:11,612 --> 00:23:13,922
What about the blood from Joan Mark s' shoe?

360
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:15,989
Also a match.

361
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,589
Joan and Gavin both stepped in Donna's blood.

362
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:22,974
- Fine. I went there.
- We already know that.

363
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,122
We're looking for, "Fine,

364
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:26,789
I went there

365
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:28,534
and..."

366
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:33,766
My client went there after the fact.
He was looking for his girlfriend. Didn't find her.

367
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,840
Right.

368
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,731
- He found a crime scene.
- Broken glass.

369
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,838
A pool of blood.

370
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:43,191
- But you didn't call 911.
- I was scared.

371
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,257
I took off.

372
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:47,987
Besides, there was
a restraining order against me.

373
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:51,063
Gavin, what colour's your car?

374
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:54,068
- Your missing Thunderbird.
- Blue. Why?

375
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,121
Interior?

376
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:57,597
Black. Did you find it?

377
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,831
- Not yet.
- But we will.

378
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:02,722
OK. The tree is a point of reference.

379
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:05,314
Yeah, and since the bullet didn't hit the tree

380
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,382
and the blood's to the west,

381
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:11,531
then the through-and-through
defines our search area.

382
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:13,917
The furthest drop of blood is here.

383
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:18,385
The spatter seems to be confined
to a 45-degree angle.

384
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:22,567
So the bullet should be
somewhere between your rope and mine.

385
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:28,254
Yeah. We've reduced a 360-degree crime scene
to a 45-degree angle.

386
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:31,294
Congratulations to us.

387
00:24:31,424 --> 00:24:33,364
It's still a needle in a haystack.

388
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,930
Nick...

389
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,081
Yeah?

390
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,167
Let's pack it up.
The bullet couldn't have gone this far.

391
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:26,222
Hey. Saw your Tahoe.
I didn't expect to see you guys back here.

392
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,468
Just... uh... tying up a few loose ends.

393
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:30,683
Maybe this'll help.

394
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:34,013
James Jasper didn't purchase a hunting licence.

395
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:37,099
Well, he was out of work.
Maybe he was trying to save money.

396
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:41,686
A licence is 24 buck s. Hunting without one
is a $1,000 fine and six months in jail.

397
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:42,867
Ooh!

398
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:46,758
Oh, well, that's not worth the risk.
Maybe he wasn't up here to hunt.

399
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:48,472
We haven't heard a single shot.

400
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:50,455
Where are these hunters?

401
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:52,363
You only hunt deer at dusk and dawn.

402
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:54,964
Right. Right. Feeding time.

403
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:57,724
It's when they're out in the open.
And other game?

404
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:00,080
This time of year, only deer's in season.

405
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:02,307
Take off those vests if you want.

406
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,379
No-one hunts during the day,

407
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:08,158
but the coroner placed
Jasper's time of death at 2pm.

408
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:11,241
Yeah. It's an odd time for a hunting accident.

409
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:21,759
Hey. Brass is holding the boyfriend
on a TRO violation.

410
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:25,002
I'm going to the lab to process the prints
from the toilet seat.

411
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:28,087
Guy claims he was in and out.
No time to make a pit stop.

412
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:31,093
- I processed the prints.
- You did?

413
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,819
- They're not a match to Joan's boyfriend.
- What?!

414
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,720
But we do have a match.

415
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:38,078
Donna's cyber boyfriend.

416
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:42,546
- I thought he was in jail?
- Just released. His parole officer brought him in.

417
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:46,236
You're fishing. I just got out of the joint.
I was never at Donna's.

418
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:50,012
We found your fingerprints
on the toilet seat in her bathroom.

419
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,903
What are you gonna do?
Arrest me for flushing the toilet?

420
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:57,891
Well, unfortunately, I can't arrest you for lying.

421
00:26:58,015 --> 00:26:59,516
Help me out here.

422
00:26:59,638 --> 00:27:03,899
Mickey, you have the right to an attorney,
but if you're not hiding anything,

423
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,847
I suggest you answer their questions.

424
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,912
(Sighs)

425
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,362
Look, we met over the internet.

426
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,731
We had a lot in common.

427
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:16,802
Donna understood my situation.

428
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:18,871
When I told her I was getting out...

429
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:20,618
she invited me over.

430
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,602
No-one's ever brought me flowers.

431
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:30,285
She served takeout. What do I care?
It wasn't chipped beef.

432
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,646
- How is it?
- Sweet-and-sour pork. My favourite.

433
00:27:38,976 --> 00:27:41,238
She invites you for lunch. Everything's great.

434
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:44,730
And somewhere between the fortune cookies
and sunset

435
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:47,656
Donna and her sister are both murdered.

436
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:51,437
Thoughts?

437
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,903
Huh. I think the sister's a piece of work.

438
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:57,767
As soon as we finish eating, she shows up...

439
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,474
with an attitude.

440
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:02,437
- This is my house too!
- I'm paying the taxes.

441
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:04,990
Who the hell's this?

442
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,818
First thing I learned in the joint -
when inmates fight, you make yourself invisible.

443
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:11,196
I got out.

444
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:15,544
Six months ago,
Donna Marks ordered a sweater

445
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:18,017
and two scarves from Magnolia Apparel.

446
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:20,136
You took the order.

447
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:21,762
I took 50 calls a day.

448
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:26,019
How many of your callers invited you home
and served you Chinese food?

449
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,511
When Donna placed her order for the clothes...

450
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:35,067
she gave you her e-mail address, didn't she?

451
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,155
Yeah. She was lonely.

452
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:40,306
She struck up a conversation with me

453
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:42,052
Reached out.

454
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:44,653
Hey...

455
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:47,459
you know, I don't usually meet girls like Donna.

456
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,657
She was nice.

457
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:52,729
She was vulnerable.

458
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,087
No social life. No friends. Not even a cat.

459
00:28:55,214 --> 00:28:56,876
All she had was her work

460
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,487
She ordered from catalogues
so she had something to look forward to.

461
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:02,276
You know, Mickey...

462
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,997
I don't think your intention was to kill.

463
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,686
All of your priors are for non-violent activities,
right?

464
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,057
Look, I've been in the system. I know the law.

465
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,781
I admit, I was there.

466
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:16,802
So what?

467
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,744
You know where to find me.

468
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:32,066
I'll keep my eye on him.

469
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,939
Joan's boyfriend, Gavin Pallard,
blood on his shoe and a TRO.

470
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:43,836
Donna's boyfriend, Mickey Rutledge,
opportunity and a rap sheet.

471
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:47,132
Both hid the truth
until confronted with the evidence.

472
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:50,618
Well...

473
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,688
we know we have two liars.

474
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,238
Do we have a killer?

475
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:04,502
Hey.

476
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:06,572
Point of impact.

477
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,307
It's... uh...

478
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:14,080
...65 inches...

479
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,152
from the base.

480
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:21,063
- So, what does that tell us?
- Well, Donna was 5' 6".

481
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,374
If she was thrown through that glass,
the point of impact would have been lower.

482
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,766
She had multiple incised wounds.

483
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:35,971
The only contusion was on her forehead,
suggesting that's where contact was made.

484
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:38,969
So she was upright
when she went through the door.

485
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,798
She walked through it.

486
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:46,030
You saying it was an accident?

487
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:48,310
- It's your science.
- Nice work.

488
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:49,358
Thanks.

489
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,074
PD found Pallard's Thunderbird
hidden off the 169, five miles from the dump site.

490
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:56,347
Hook up with Auto Detail. Tow it in.

491
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:07,708
Radiator's cracked.

492
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,908
That might explain why Joan bought coolant
twice in the last week from a convenience store.

493
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:15,264
- We ran her credit cards.
- Well...

494
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,473
whoever drove this last
filled up the radiator fluid,

495
00:31:18,597 --> 00:31:20,617
but instead of coolant, they used water.

496
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:23,751
Either someone unfamiliar
with the car or...

497
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:27,112
...someone in a desperate situation, maybe.

498
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:29,588
Radiator cap. I'll print it.

499
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,063
Good.

500
00:31:32,197 --> 00:31:34,263
Grab me a sample of fluid too, will you?

501
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,535
Gunshot residue.

502
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,864
Expect the unexpected.

503
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:46,355
GSR on the clothing means
the victim was shot at close range.

504
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:50,379
So now what? We're thinking murder?

505
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:52,768
Or suicide.

506
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:56,064
He never fired his rifle.
What did he shoot himself with?

507
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:58,129
OK.

508
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:01,538
But if he was murdered,
we should have found some evidence

509
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,574
of the killer at the crime scene.

510
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:06,655
Whoever shot him
would have been eyeball to eyeball.

511
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:09,382
Who could have gotten that close
without a struggle?

512
00:32:09,504 --> 00:32:11,248
Exactly.

513
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:13,312
It's somebody he knew.

514
00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:17,009
I'm gonna call on Vega.
See if he's checked out Mrs Jasper's alibi.

515
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,075
- OK.
- I'll meet you at the car.

516
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:21,145
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, Sara.

517
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:23,216
How's your case going?

518
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:25,771
You ever try to print a radiator cap?

519
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:27,763
Smudge city.

520
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:29,914
Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's impossible.

521
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:32,388
But it's just a radiator cap, so...

522
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:34,588
- give yourself a break.
- Thank you.

523
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:36,619
Sara...

524
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,779
...you gotta get out more.

525
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:49,282
So you got this water from a radiator?

526
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:51,349
Yes.

527
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,420
It ain't no Rocky Mountain spring.

528
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,183
- What is it, Greg?
- A nasty sodium count.

529
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,412
Potassium. Phosphorus.

530
00:33:03,455 --> 00:33:05,926
You've got that look. What did I say right?

531
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,890
OK. Thanks for the info.

532
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:13,961
We'll keep you posted.

533
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:16,400
Well, Mrs Jasper's alibi checks out.

534
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,710
She was at work from 10am to 6pm.

535
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:20,780
Ate lunch at her desk.

536
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,851
She didn't kill her husband.

537
00:33:22,982 --> 00:33:24,759
Murder for hire?

538
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,845
A pro would have shot him in the heart.

539
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:29,914
This guy was shot in the gut.

540
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:32,516
Bullet didn't come close to his spinal cord.

541
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:38,642
Wait a minute.
Abdominal injuries take time to bleed out.

542
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:42,018
It would take 10 minutes
for haemorrhagic shock to set in.

543
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:43,563
He would have been mobile.

544
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:46,110
Right. But he never moved.

545
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:50,180
He was in front of this tree
when he was shot. He didn't try to reach his car

546
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:52,243
or get help, he just...

547
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:55,328
...sat down and waited to die.

548
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,398
Yeah.

549
00:33:57,528 --> 00:33:59,468
Yeah, I see where you're going here.

550
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,086
His injuries and his behaviour
aren't consistent with murder,

551
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:05,810
but they're not consistent with suicide either.

552
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:12,053
99 out of 100 suicides by a gun -
muzzle to the mouth, bullet to the brain.

553
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:14,123
There's always just that one.

554
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:15,998
Look...

555
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,592
suicidals want it quick and painless.

556
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,398
Bleeding to death is slow and painful.

557
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,749
Not to mention he never fired his rifle.

558
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:27,120
No, the weapon we found was never fired.

559
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:29,749
That's a big stretch.

560
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:31,824
He brought his rifle plus a spare?

561
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:33,974
He shoots himself in the gut.

562
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,810
Leaving himself time to hide the weapon.

563
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:42,538
There's no blood trail. And what did he do
with the spare? Throw it up a tree?

564
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:47,412
How about the lake?

565
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:50,341
Yeah.

566
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,405
Yeah, OK. Heads up.

567
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:03,528
I've just marked our search area.

568
00:35:08,124 --> 00:35:10,064
You know...

569
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:12,134
even if your theory's right,

570
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:16,721
we still haven't explained the insurance policy
purchased by the wife.

571
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:18,792
(Tapping)

572
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:21,190
Hey!

573
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:24,273
Metal on metal.

574
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,431
- Hold on, let me give you a hand.
- OK.

575
00:35:29,558 --> 00:35:31,498
It's right there

576
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,810
Yean I got it I got it

577
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,008
Whoa...

578
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,079
Water pistol.

579
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,085
Well, we never found the bullet,
but we found the gun.

580
00:35:57,651 --> 00:35:59,994
Mr Jasper committed suicide.

581
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,628
And the wife's out a million buck s.

582
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:06,695
Thank you.

583
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:10,755
Mrs Jasper...

584
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:16,323
you purchased a life insurance policy
on your husband,

585
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:18,790
in which you are the sole beneficiary.

586
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:21,716
I don't know what you're talking about.

587
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,954
We have the actual application for the policy...

588
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:29,023
with your signature.

589
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:33,736
Ma'am, you are aware that insurance policies
exclude suicide?

590
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:36,043
Your husband...

591
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:38,115
staged his death...

592
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:40,751
to...look like a homicide.

593
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:43,968
As a beneficiary...

594
00:36:44,092 --> 00:36:46,851
if you knew of his intentions to...

595
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:50,015
...take his own life...

596
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,080
that would constitute fraud.

597
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:55,375
If I knew, I would have stopped him.

598
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:58,906
Jimmy was everything to me.

599
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:03,730
I didn't... I didn't buy the policy.
I didn't know about his plans.

600
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:05,282
Hi.

601
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:07,344
Hi.

602
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:12,013
Do you wanna explain this?

603
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:14,453
Sure.

604
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:20,216
Mrs Jasper, when you claimed
your husband's personal possessions,

605
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:22,283
you signed a release form, yeah?

606
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:26,836
I ran that form
through our questionable documents lab,

607
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:31,707
and I crosschecked your signature
with the signature on the insurance application.

608
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,761
It's not yours.

609
00:37:35,892 --> 00:37:39,217
Your husband must have forged it.

610
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:41,686
I also checked with the insurance company.

611
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,179
Your husband opened the account.

612
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,320
Why? Why?

613
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,454
I don't understand that. Why did he do that?

614
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:57,773
Because he knew that if he had bought
the insurance, it would have sent up a red flag.

615
00:37:57,854 --> 00:37:59,955
So, what you're saying is...

616
00:38:02,523 --> 00:38:05,156
...that my husband...

617
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,788
killed himself for me?

618
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,525
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,056
It may sound funny, but I'm proud of it.

620
00:38:20,182 --> 00:38:22,860
It took a year to put in
my new fertigation system.

621
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:25,822
It mixes the fertiliser
with the irrigation system.

622
00:38:25,946 --> 00:38:28,129
How about that? Economical and practical.

623
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:30,281
What you're looking for is over here.

624
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:37,754
Cars are always overheating on this stretch.

625
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:39,579
And everyone thinks water is free.

626
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:43,473
What do you use in your fertiliser?
Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium?

627
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,787
Standard 6-10-10 mixture.

628
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:47,859
Mr Willoughby...

629
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,945
would you mind if I fingerprint your spigot?

630
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:53,223
No-one's ever asked me that before.

631
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,626
Thirsty?

632
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:17,130
I'm good, thanks.

633
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,761
I wouldn't drink it either.

634
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:21,353
I wouldn't even put it in my radiator.

635
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:26,020
I don't have all the pieces yet, Mickey, but...

636
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,088
I'll tell you what we do have.

637
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:31,054
- You're an ex-con. Get the hell out!
- Don't listen.

638
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:33,089
This is my house. This is my life.

639
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:35,811
You're so desperate
you date through the computer.

640
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:38,075
Then you end up with him. Pathetic!

641
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:41,525
We know that Joan scratched Donna.

642
00:39:41,657 --> 00:39:43,884
We also know that Donna died first.

643
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:45,674
I didn't kill her.

644
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:48,718
That's right. You didn't.

645
00:39:48,843 --> 00:39:51,069
- You are so selfish!
- Get your hands off me!

646
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:53,179
Donna's death was an accident.

647
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:55,774
Oh! Aaargh!

648
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:58,741
But Joan went off on you.

649
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,791
And up to that point
you hadn't done anything wrong

650
00:40:01,914 --> 00:40:06,128
- So what went wrong?
- It wasn't my fault.

651
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,948
- She's dead.
- You are going back where you came from.

652
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:17,656
Rehabilitation was working for me.

653
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:19,726
Put a guy in that position...

654
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:21,797
He's got to go all the way.

655
00:40:22,293 --> 00:40:24,233
Aaargh!

656
00:40:24,364 --> 00:40:26,302
(Neck snaps)

657
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,085
You figured if you hid the bodies,
you'd be in the clear.

658
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,038
But you didn't nave a car

659
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:37,182
Joan did.

660
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:54,069
You could have just backed off.
Let Joan make the call.

661
00:40:56,108 --> 00:40:58,948
I would have landed myself
right back in the joint.

662
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:01,300
- You don't know that.
- Come on.

663
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:04,026
Who's gonna believe a guy like me?

664
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:06,577
A guy like me.

665
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:14,815
Hey, it's Sara.

666
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,425
I was thinking...

667
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,498
You wanna go out... somewhere?
