The Noonans weren't exactly
the fathering type,

151

and dad, God rest his soul,
wasn't exactly cuddly.

Well, dad was a prick.
He was an Irish Mick of a prick.

And Jo knew you felt that way,

154
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,430
knew how you felt about being
a father because of that!

155

Just because he was a son of a bitch

156
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,670
didn't mean I was going
to be a son of a bitch.

157

I mean, a couple of years ago,
we even decided to have kids.

Yeah, I remember.

159

one time at dinner.

That's really pretty.

171

We tried to get pregnant,
but then I, you know,

172
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,670
I went to the doctor,
and he told me it was this

173
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,270
low sperm count,
and that was the end of that.

174
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,750
That was the end.

Yeah, of course she did.

181
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,790
I mean, the place was a dump.
It was a total fixer.

182

Yeah, I know, I mean, I was
really wrapped up in the book

Oh, thank you.
And you know who I am?

553
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,910
Of course.

554
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,270
You, uh, inherited
that house on the lake,

555
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,230
but you haven't been back since...

556
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,470
Yeah, since my wife died.

557
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,470
[Quietly] Yeah.

558
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,230
Well, um, you take care
of yourself now, okay?

559
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,470
Stay out of the road.
Nice to meet you, Mattie.

560
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,670
Nice to meet you.

561
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,710
- Bye.
- Bye!

562
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,790
Bye, Kyra!

563
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,830
[Tires screech]

564
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,110
Hey.
Hey, uh, you want a menu?

565
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,310
Uh, I was told
to order a villageburger.

566
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,910
One villageburger coming right up.

567
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,350
Uh, what do you want on it?

568
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,630
Everything.
And a local brew.

569
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,590
Grab a seat.
We'll bring it to you.

570
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,310
Thank you.

571
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,990
Villageburger, on!
And drag it through the garden.

572
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:04,430
[Sighs]

573
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,230
See you made a new friend
this afternoon.

574
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,830
Yeah, yeah.
Two, actually.

575
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:14,590
I hear that Mattie Devore can be
quite a dear in the right position.

576
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:16,750
Yeah.

577
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,710
You hear a lot,
old-timer?

578
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,710
More than you know, son.

579
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,830
Old don't mean dead.

580
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,390
Thank you.

581
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,390
[Sighs] You'd do well
to keep your distance

582
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,190
from Mattie Devore,
Mr. Noonan.

583
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,350
- Mm.
Uh-huh.

584
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,150
How do you know my name?

585
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,230
We don't see a celebrity
here every day.

586
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,830
Yes, well, I'm hardly
what you'd call a celebrity.

587
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:53,190
Well, we take what we can get.

588
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,550
I'm really sorry to hear about
what happened to your wife.

589
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,150
Hmm.

590
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,510
She was a doll.

591
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,990
So when she'd come in here
and eat, uh...

592
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,590
Would she be alone?

593
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,670
Uh, I guess so.

594
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,550
Or sometimes
with Bill Dean and his wife,

595
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,470
sometimes with Brenda Meserve,

596
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,470
and maybe another friend or two.

597
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,950
"Another friend or two,"
huh? Yeah.

598
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,550
Maybe. Yeah.

599
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,870
Why are you so interested in who

600
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,790
your wife was eating with,
Mr. Noonan?

601
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,470
Mike. Mike.
Just... just call me Mike.

602
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,950
I don't know, I guess
I'd just like to know

603
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,150
what life was like
for a year on Dark Score.

604
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,630
You know, all those years that
I couldn't make it up here.

605
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,830
So...
Hmm.

606
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,750
Anyway.

607
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,390
Mattie Devore...
She's a...

608
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,190
A nice enough girl,
only she can be trouble.

609
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,030
That ain't fair, Buddy.

610
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,990
Mattie Devore's in trouble
and with the wrong people.

611
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,190
Person.

612
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,830
And who's that person?

613
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,230
Max Devore.

614
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,550
He's a mean old son of a buck.

615
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,750
I mean, he owns that big,
uh, computer company.

616
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,670
Multi-millionaire.

617
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,190
Yeah, I think I, uh, may have
seen him yesterday afternoon

618
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,270
in the window
of that old resort up there.

619
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:03,830
- Mm, Warrington's.
- Mm, yeah.

620
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,950
Yeah, that's the fella.
Mean old cuss.

621
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,030
He wants custody
of the little girl, Kyra.

622
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,350
And why would he want to take
his daughter's little girl away?

623
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,950
- Daughter-in-law.

624
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,270
Mattie married Devore's only son.

625
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,230
- Devore had the boy
when he was 60-something

626
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,950
with some Vegas showgirl
who's no longer

627
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,270
in the picture, of course.

628
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,870
- Oh, okay.
- And so about a year ago,

629
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,110
Lance, that's Devore's son,

630
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,950
he goes a little Dark Score crazy.

631
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,750
What does that mean?

632
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,270
He tried to drown the little girl.

633
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,870
His own flesh and blood.

634
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,350
And Mattie ended up killing Lance

635
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,790
just to protect the little girl,
and ever since then,

636
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,310
Devore's made it his mission
to take Kyra away from her.

637
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,830
And what Max Devore wants,
Max Devore gets.

638
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,390
[Both laugh]

639
00:49:19,985 --> 00:49:21,025

[Phone ringing]

645
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:56,685
Hello?

646
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:00,285
Mr. Noonan?

647
00:51:00,485 --> 00:51:00,965
Yes?

648
00:51:01,845 --> 00:51:04,965
- I understand you met
my daughter-in-law today.

649
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:09,445
Ah, this must
be Mr. Devore.

650
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:12,405
Yes, well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

651
00:51:12,645 --> 00:51:14,925
I'm concerned about my granddaughter.

652
00:51:15,565 --> 00:51:18,765
I was told there was
an incident in the road today.

653
00:51:18,845 --> 00:51:21,805
- Uh-huh.
How did you get my number?

654
00:51:21,805 --> 00:51:24,325
You were seen talking to them.

655
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:26,125
Yeah, I met a woman and a little girl

656
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,005
on the road this morning, yes.

657
00:51:28,045 --> 00:51:30,845
I stopped to ask directions
to Buddy Jellison's cafe.

658
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:33,805
Don't lie to me,
Mr. Noonan.

659
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:36,445
Why are you protecting
my daughter-in-law?

660
00:51:36,485 --> 00:51:40,725
Did she promise you something, hmm?

661
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:42,325
Listen to me,
Mr. Devore!

662
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:43,765
I don't like your tone of voice,

663
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:45,205
and I don't know how
you got my number,

664
00:51:45,245 --> 00:51:47,245
but you can shove it up
your ass, you understand?

665
00:51:47,325 --> 00:51:51,525

[Knocking at door]

735
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:53,205
- Mr. Michael Noonan?
- Uh-huh, that's me.

736
00:56:53,325 --> 00:56:54,005
This is for you.

737
00:56:55,485 --> 00:56:56,285
Just take it.

738
00:56:59,485 --> 00:57:01,085
What is it?
A subpoena?

739
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:03,565
To appear in the offices
of Elmer Durgin,

740
00:57:03,605 --> 00:57:06,125
<i>attorney-at-law and guardian
Ad Litem of Kyra Devore.</i>

741
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:08,125
And it's my duty to remind you
of the penalty

742
00:57:08,165 --> 00:57:09,165
should you fail to...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

743
00:57:09,245 --> 00:57:10,725
I'll be there.

745
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:15,925
Let me give you a piece of advice.

746
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,445
Don't mess
with Mr. Devore.

747
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:19,725
Or he'll squash me like a bug?

748
00:57:19,765 --> 00:57:21,365
[Scoffs] I believe the script says,

749
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:25,165
"let me give you a piece of advice.

00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:28,445

or he'll squash you like a bug."

751
00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:30,045
That's right,
you can say stuff like that

752
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:31,805

book writer.

753

00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:38,285
[Sighs] I'll see you
at the deposition, Noonan.

755
00:57:38,365 --> 00:57:41,005
Sounds good.

759
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:17,965
Is that what you're trying to say, Jo?

760
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:21,005

[Screaming continues]

768
00:58:53,605 --> 00:58:55,405

Is that you?

770
00:58:57,445 --> 00:58:59,565
Sara?

771

Is that you?

772
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:07,925

You want me, just like all them boys.

You'll see, baby.

Mattie?

817
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:44,285
And write.

818
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:49,925
You have to write.

819
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:52,845
I can't write.

820
01:02:52,885 --> 01:02:56,365
I can't write without you, Jo.

821
01:02:56,365 --> 01:02:59,085
I'll help you now.

822
01:02:59,085 --> 01:03:01,765

Then you should do what she says.

826
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,445
Didn't she tell you to help me?

827
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,205
That's not what she meant.

01:03:51,645 --> 01:03:56,125

You have no idea what Jo meant.

01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:59,005
No idea.

<i>As you know, I'm Kyra Devore's
guardian Ad Litem.</i>

838
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:37,225
You know what that means,
Mr. Noonan?

839
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:41,145
You've been appointed by
the judge to decide what's best

840
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:43,025
for Kyra, should a custody trial
become necessary.

841
01:04:43,065 --> 01:04:45,905
Very good.

842
01:04:45,905 --> 01:04:47,865
And the judge would not,
in such a case,

843
01:04:47,905 --> 01:04:50,905
be required to base his decision
on my conclusions.

844
01:04:51,865 --> 01:04:53,905
But that's usually what happens.

845
01:04:54,745 --> 01:04:58,065
[Electric whirring]

846
01:05:05,705 --> 01:05:07,665
Sorry to be late, Elmer.

847
01:05:08,145 --> 01:05:10,825
George had trouble getting here.

848
01:05:11,985 --> 01:05:13,505
Let's turn to your first meeting

849
01:05:13,505 --> 01:05:16,145
with Mattie and Kyra Devore
on the highway, shall we?

850
01:05:16,385 --> 01:05:17,025
Sure.

851
01:05:17,905 --> 01:05:19,825
Kyra Devore was all alone.

852
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:21,665
Her mother wasn't with her, right?

853
01:05:21,705 --> 01:05:23,225
- That's a poorly-phrased
question,

854
01:05:23,265 --> 01:05:24,665
but I suppose the answer is yes.

855
01:05:25,945 --> 01:05:27,825
I'm flattered to have
my grammar corrected

856
01:05:27,825 --> 01:05:29,145
by a best-selling author.

857
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:31,705
Is this
a better-phrased question?

858
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,945
You could have run Kyra Devore over

859
01:05:33,945 --> 01:05:36,345
'cause she was playing in
the middle of the road, correct?

860
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,145
The phrasing isn't better, no.

861
01:05:38,345 --> 01:05:39,865
And my answer is absolutely not.

862
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:41,425
I was driving the speed limit.

863
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:43,145
I saw Kyra in plenty of time.

864
01:05:43,265 --> 01:05:44,585
So it's your experience
that most people obey

865
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:46,185
the speed limit
on that stretch of the road?

866
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:47,825
I haven't spent that much time
on Dark Score Lake.

867
01:05:47,905 --> 01:05:49,345
I can't say.

868
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,105
Even in your limited experience,

869
01:05:52,145 --> 01:05:54,385
do you think that most people
obey the speed limit

870
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:55,625
on that road, Mr. Noonan?

871
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:57,865
I haven't done
a traffic survey. Sorry.

872
01:05:57,905 --> 01:06:01,945
Okay, Mr. Noonan.
Then answer me this.

873
01:06:01,945 --> 01:06:04,785
If you hadn't carried
Kyra Devore to safety,

874
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:06,705
isn't it possible that
she could've been hit

875
01:06:06,785 --> 01:06:08,905
by another car?
[Whispers] Just wait.

876
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:11,145
You know what?

877
01:06:11,185 --> 01:06:13,825
I left my crystal ball at home.

878
01:06:13,825 --> 01:06:16,585
[Chuckles] I really can't say.

879
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:18,305
I'd like to remind you

880
01:06:18,345 --> 01:06:20,305
you're under oath,
Mr. Noonan.

881
01:06:20,305 --> 01:06:22,145
I'd like to remind you that
I answered your question,

882
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:25,705
leading as it was.

883
01:06:25,905 --> 01:06:28,865
Under oath...

884
01:06:28,905 --> 01:06:31,905
[Sighs]

885
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:34,225
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Durgin.

886
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:36,625
If you're on Kyra Devore's side,

887
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,185
why does it actually seem that
you're working for Max Devore?

888
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:45,665
[Taps gavel]

889
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:49,265
This meeting is adjourned.

890
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,585
This isn't over yet, Noonan.

891
01:06:57,665 --> 01:06:59,505
Oh, thank God, Max.

892
01:06:59,585 --> 01:07:01,025
It's just starting to get fun.

893
01:07:01,025 --> 01:07:03,985
I couldn't agree more.

894
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:17,665
Mike!

895
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:19,665
Hi.

896
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:21,985
Thank you!

897
01:07:22,065 --> 01:07:23,505
It's...
Yeah.

898
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:25,865
It's my pleasure.
Really.

899
01:07:25,905 --> 01:07:28,785
I have to pick up Kyra from day care.

900
01:07:28,785 --> 01:07:30,305
Would you like to walk me to my car?

901
01:07:30,345 --> 01:07:33,225
Sure.

902
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:35,265
Why not?

903
01:07:35,265 --> 01:07:38,785
So are you working on a new book?

904
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:39,985
- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

905
01:07:40,065 --> 01:07:41,505
Oh, my God, I'm so lame.

906
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:43,145
That must be
the most annoying question,

907
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:45,745
right up there with, "where
do you get your ideas from?"

908
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:48,385
<i>That is an annoying question.</i>

909
01:07:48,385 --> 01:07:49,985
The one about working on a new book?

910

Well, that's just...

911
01:07:52,305 --> 01:07:53,265
Writer's block?

912
01:07:55,785 --> 01:07:58,625
Mm.

913
01:07:58,665 --> 01:08:00,225
Yeah.

914
01:08:00,265 --> 01:08:02,305
My next book,

915
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:03,825
the one that's coming out
this winter...

916
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:05,705
<i>Yeah, I know about it.
Red shirt man, right?</i>

917
01:08:05,745 --> 01:08:06,985
Yeah.

918
01:08:07,025 --> 01:08:08,945
I wrote that book over a decade ago.

919
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:10,545
It's a trunk novel,

920
01:08:11,185 --> 01:08:13,025
a book I never thought
should see the light of day.

921
01:08:13,065 --> 01:08:14,985
I passed it off to my agent
as a new novel

922
01:08:15,025 --> 01:08:18,385
just to keep my little...
[Sighs]

923
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:19,825
Dilemma a secret.

924
01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:21,665
Nobody knows it's an old book?

925
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:23,945
Nobody but you.

926
01:08:23,985 --> 01:08:27,025
Well, your secret's safe with me, sir.

[Chuckles]

928
01:08:30,305 --> 01:08:34,305
My agent, my little agent Marty,

929
01:08:34,305 --> 01:08:35,825
after he read
the first couple of pages,

930
01:08:35,905 --> 01:08:39,945
he called me up and, uh...
[Laughs]

931
01:08:40,065 --> 01:08:42,865
You know what he...?
[Laughs]

932
01:08:42,905 --> 01:08:44,305
- You know what he said?
- What?

933
01:08:44,345 --> 01:08:46,505
This is the best thing
I've written in years.

934
01:08:46,545 --> 01:08:49,225
Well, call it classic Michael Noonan.

935
01:08:49,265 --> 01:08:50,785
Yeah, you could do.

936
01:08:50,825 --> 01:08:54,305
Marty would, you know.
But Marty lies.

937
01:08:54,345 --> 01:08:56,585
All the time.
[Chuckles]

938
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:57,825
He always wants to say
the right thing,

939
01:08:57,865 --> 01:09:01,625
but says the wrong thing.

940
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:04,545
Thomas Hardy said that...

941
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,185
Compared to the dullest human
being walking on the earth,

942
01:09:07,225 --> 01:09:10,345
the most brilliantly drawn
character in any novel

943
01:09:10,385 --> 01:09:14,865
is nothing more than a bag of bones.

944
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:16,625
The only problem is that
sometimes I feel like

945
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:19,785
nothing more than
a bag of bones myself.

946
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:22,385
A bag of bones without
the energy or the... the talent

947
01:09:22,385 --> 01:09:24,505
to do what I thought I was born to do.

948
01:09:24,585 --> 01:09:26,105
I...

949
01:09:29,745 --> 01:09:31,345
I don't think I can write anymore.

950
01:09:31,345 --> 01:09:35,145
You miss her a lot, don't you?

951
01:09:35,185 --> 01:09:37,345
Yeah.

952
01:09:37,385 --> 01:09:40,065
I saw her once.
She was very beautiful.

953
01:09:40,105 --> 01:09:42,425
Where did you see her?

954
01:09:42,465 --> 01:09:44,265
At Warrington's.

955
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,065
I was, uh, a waitress there.

956
01:09:46,105 --> 01:09:48,305
And I was working a shift
with my friend Laurie Wilton,

957
01:09:48,305 --> 01:09:52,385
and... and I saw her, and I said,
"there's Mrs. Noonan,

958
01:09:52,425 --> 01:09:55,865
the writer's wife.
Isn't she pretty?"

959
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:57,145
I think Laurie was more interested

960
01:09:57,185 --> 01:09:58,905
in the guy your wife was sitting with.

961
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:01,665
What guy?

962
01:10:01,705 --> 01:10:02,865
He was just a guy, I guess.

963
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:06,585
- Oh.
- Did I say something wrong?

964
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,625
Yeah, I mean, who was the guy
having dinner with my wife?

965
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,185
I'm... I'm sorry.
I, um...

966
01:10:10,225 --> 01:10:11,825
No, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

967
01:10:11,865 --> 01:10:16,585
It's just...
I'm sorry.

[Clears throat]

969
01:10:18,185 --> 01:10:19,905
After Jo died,

970
01:10:19,945 --> 01:10:23,665
I found out she was pregnant.

971
01:10:23,665 --> 01:10:27,225
[Sighs] Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.

972
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,625
No, no.
It's not your fault.

973
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:32,945
It's just... Messy.
Complicated.

974
01:10:32,945 --> 01:10:34,745
Plus the fact...

975
01:10:34,825 --> 01:10:37,325
I keep thinking that Jo...

976
01:10:39,205 --> 01:10:41,265
That she brought me here.

977
01:10:41,343 --> 01:10:42,263
Jo...

978
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:44,099
brought me here.

979
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:45,905
After she died, she brought you here?

980
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:47,145
For a reason.

981
01:10:47,485 --> 01:10:49,165
Like what?

982
01:10:52,505 --> 01:10:55,025
I don't know...
Yet.

983
01:10:56,905 --> 01:10:58,185
Crazy, right?
[Laughs]

984
01:10:58,825 --> 01:10:59,985
Not to me.

985
01:11:00,185 --> 01:11:02,145
Yeah, well,
maybe she did bring me here

986
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:03,785
so she could finally tell me what...

987
01:11:05,305 --> 01:11:08,225
She was doing here.

988
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,705
Or maybe it's to get you
to write again.

989
01:11:13,025 --> 01:11:13,705
Yeah.

990
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:16,505
Maybe you're right.

991
01:11:24,265 --> 01:11:24,905

Hey, Sid.
Hey, Mikey.

1271
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:59,100
I just noticed
I missed your call... what's up?

1272
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:01,860
Uh...
It's, um...

1273
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,780
It's about Jo.

1274
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:05,260
You okay?

1275
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:06,660
I haven't heard from you in a while.

1276
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:07,980
Starting to get worried.

1277
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:09,500
No, no, no, I'm great.

1278
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:11,180
I'm really, really, really good.

1279
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:13,740
Uh, really enjoying myself out here.

1280
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:15,180
Glad you pushed me
out the door, you know.

1281
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,140
It's a change of scenery...

1282
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:18,380
Good for the spirit, so to speak.

1283
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:20,060
Well, that's great.

1284
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:22,100
You sound out of breath,
by the way, like, uh...

1285
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:23,900
Like you've been knockin'
the boots or something.

1286
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:25,300
[Laughs]

1287
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,980
No, no, no knocking boots for me.

1288
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,500
Yeah, well, okay, whatever, Mikey.

1289
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:31,420
So what's going on?

1290
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,980
Uh...

1291
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:35,060
When, uh...

1292
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:39,220
When you and Jo got together
up here for dinner, um...

1293
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,660
Yeah, it's that,
uh, big old place, um...

1294
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:42,100
Warrington's?

1295
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,540
Warrington's!
Yeah, that's it.

1296
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:45,100
Well, when you were there,

1297
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:47,020
or a-anywhere around
Dark Score, I guess,

1298
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:49,740
uh, did something happen with a lift?

1299
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,100
A lift?

1300
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:53,500
A lift. Uh, did you
take a lift somewhere?

1301
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,100
Was there a place called "the lift"?

1302
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:59,700
I mean, I-I don't know...
Anything to do with a lift.

1303
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,260
Sorry, Mikey, it's...
It's not ringing any bells.

1304
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:06,500
Okay, okay.
All right, uh...

1305
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,380
Don't worry.

1306
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,340
All's well.
Thanks.

1307
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:10,820
Why do you ask?

1308
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:13,620
Oh, it's... it's just, um,
something I'm working on,

1309
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,580
something that's, uh...

1310
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:17,020
Rattling around inside my head.

1311
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:19,820
Hey, fantastic!
Oh, that's great, Mikey.

1312
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:20,500
Glad to hear it.

1313
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:22,060
Sorry I couldn't help you, though.

1314
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,460
Yeah.

1316

You take care of yourself now.
Love you.

1317
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,260
Talk to you soon, Mikey.
Bye.

1318
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,420

How are you this day, huh?

1323
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:49,460
Oh?

1324
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,140
You want to tell me something?

1325
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:54,980

Whore run off and left you,
has she, Noonan?

1337
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:12,740
I always liked a whore.

1338
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:13,860
Didn't I, Rogette?

1339
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:17,180
Yes, sir...
In their place.

1340
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:19,580
She good, that little whore?

1341
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:24,260
Must be good to have
kept my son a prisoner

1342
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,060
in that nasty little trailer

1343
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,220

What do you want, Devore?

1345
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:32,940
Do you care
about your soul, Mr. Noonan?

1346
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,940
God's butterfly caught
in a cocoon of flesh

1347
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:40,460
that will one day stink and rot

1348
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:41,940
just like mine.

1349
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:45,780
What the hell are you talking about?

1350
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,300
I'm going to give you
one chance to save your soul.

1351
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:50,060
Go away...

1352
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:51,420
Right now, this very day,

1353
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:54,460
in the clothes you stand in,

1354
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:58,140
and leave the whore
and the "whorelet" to me.

1355
01:39:58,180 --> 01:39:59,700
That "whorelet" you're talking about

1356
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,300
is your granddaughter!

1357
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:05,940
I'm not afraid to do
the things that need to be done.

1358
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:08,700
You're even crazier
than I thought, the two of you.

1359
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:10,460
Are you sure you want to be

1360
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,540
the little girl's hero, Noonan?

1361
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:15,500

Hi, you've reached the lake house,
please leave me a message.

1373
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,030
Hey, Mike, I tried to call your cell,

1374
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:45,390
but the voice mail didn't pick up.

1375
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:46,990
I Fed Ex'd you a bunch of galleys

1377
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:50,310
And I got to tell you again, Mike,

1378
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:53,110
I think this is the best
Michael Noonan book yet.

1379
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:54,990
Scribner feels the same way, too,

1380
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:57,310
which is why they did such great
work on the cover, I think.

1381
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:00,510
Mm, I should have sent them
the one I wrote 15 years ago.

1382
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:02,710
That one would have really
knocked their socks off.

1383
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:04,550
But as you know, with this
crunch publication schedule,

1384
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:05,790
time is of the essence,

1385
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:07,790
so the sooner you can get back to us

1386
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:09,310
with your final revisions, the better.

1387
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:11,110
Oh, sure, Marty.

1388
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:13,150
Nothing pressing going on here, mate.

1389
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:14,870
Thanks, Mike... hope
you're doing well otherwise.

1390
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:18,390

01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,360
Mr. Devore may change his goals,

1446
01:45:26,490 --> 01:45:28,970
but he does not lose.

1447
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:33,190
You were the one who looked
like a loser today, Mr. Noonan...

1448
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:36,750
Pawing around and yelping out
there like a bitch in heat.

1449
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:38,470
Listen, you ugly bitch,

1450
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:41,150
if either of you ever
try anything like that again,

1451
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:42,550
I'm going to come over there

1452
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:44,270
and wring your scrawny Turkey necks.

1453
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:45,750
Do you understand me?

1454
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:48,910
And who's the sore loser now,
Mr. Noonan?

1455
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:55,030
Enough pleasantries.

1456
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:57,670
We have a deal.

1457
01:45:57,670 --> 01:46:00,990
Wonderful, Mr. Noonan.

1458
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:08,910
And before I let you go,

1459
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:11,430
Mr. Devore would like me
to remind you

1460
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:16,030
"custody has
its responsibilities."

Mike, Mr. Mike, help me!

1487

Sweetheart, what's wrong, child?

1488
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:06,060
Huh?
Where is she?

1489
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:08,100
Okay, come.
Come with me.

- There's a good girl.

Stay there, okay?

1503
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:36,940
I'm scared, Mr. Mike.

1504
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:39,780
We're going to be fine, Kyra.

1505
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:42,740
But you have to be very, very quiet.

1506
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:43,740
Okay?

1507
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:45,220
All right.

I'm not holding
your hand, Mr. Mike.

Are you scared, too, little one?

Oh, child.
Do you want us to help you?

1514
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:32,340
Max Devore is dead.

1515

its responsibilities!

Hey.

1526
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:32,780
Hello?

1527
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:34,320
Mike, it's Mattie.

1528
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,500
Hey, Mattie, how are you?

1529
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,860
You'll never guess
what I'm calling to tell you.

1530
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:42,300
- Max Devore's dead?
- Yes.

1531
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:44,100
He killed himself last night.

1532
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:46,580
Is it already making the rounds?

1533
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:48,420
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

1534
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,820
You know what this means, Mike?

1535
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:52,820
- Uh-uh, no,
what is it?

1536
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,420
It's over.

1537
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:57,180
That's good.

1538
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:58,900
That's really good, Mattie.

1539
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:01,700
I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.

1540
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:09,340
Do you want to come over
tomorrow night after the funeral?

1541
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:11,340
- A-are you going
to the funeral?

1542
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:12,780
No, but you are.

1543
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:17,780
And you're going to come over and
tell me every little last detail.

1544
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:20,260
Uh...

1545
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:23,980
Well, let... let me just think
about this one, now.

1546
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:26,820
I'm not sure.
Um, just let me think about it.

1547
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:27,900
Absolutely.

1548
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:29,420
I mean, you take
all the time you need, but...

1549
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:32,820
Go on.
But what?

1550
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:36,980
Jo would want you
to be happy, you know?

1551
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:42,940
[Sighs] I'm sorry.

1552
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,500
I'm sorry.
I-I shouldn't have said that.

1553
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:47,220
I-I-I shouldn't have said
any of this.

1554
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:48,500
It's okay.

1555
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,100
It's okay.

1556
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:53,420
You've done no wrong.
All's good.

1557
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:56,660
I'll come over for dinner
tomorrow night.

1558
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:02,580
I look forward to it.

1559
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:04,860
Yeah, yeah, me too.
Okay.

1560
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:06,700
Good-bye.

1561
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:08,780
Okay, bye.

Lie still bag of bones.

1565
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:38,740
Lie still bag of bones.
Lie still bag of bones.

1566
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,380
Oh, God.

1567
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:44,420
Hello, sir.

1568
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:47,980
What are you doing here?

1569
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:50,140
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to disturb you.

1570
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:52,140
Harold, is it really you?

1571
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,100
Harold?

1572
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:56,900
You look so young, so young.

1573
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:59,580
But you're dead, Harold.

1574
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:00,780
What are you doing here?

1575
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:02,660
How can this be?
Sir, I'm not...

1576
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:04,060
Max is dead.

1577
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:06,460
I went to his funeral today.

1578
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:11,100
Old mad Max Devore is finally dead.

1579
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:15,020
Sir...
I'm not Harold.

1580
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:16,700
I'm Mike.

1581
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:18,860
Harold was my grandfather.

1582
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:23,460
And I take it
that you and my grandfather

1583
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:25,940
were old friends.

1584
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:28,100
We grew up together.

1585
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:29,540
Yeah.

1586
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:31,820
My name is Edgar White.

1587
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:34,580
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. White.

1588
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:36,220
Oh, "Edgar" is fine.

1589
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:39,180
"Mr. White"
is my old man.

1590
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:43,940
And he's been gone for a long time.

1591
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:46,940
What are you doing here?

1592
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:50,620
Well, I was at, uh,
Max Devore's funeral today,

1593
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:52,180
and I saw you.

1594
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:56,340
And, um, well,
you looked pretty upset.

1595
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:59,060
Max was an old friend.

1596
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:01,740
It's never easy to bury an old friend.

1597
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:04,940
- Mm.
- [Chuckles]

1598
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:09,140
Max Devore and me...
We grew up together.

1599
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:12,580
Harold and Normal and Fred...

1600
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:15,580
And old Max, of course.

1601
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:18,980
They're all gone now.

1602
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:23,100
I'm the last one left.

1603
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:25,740
But, you know,

1604
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:27,900
I told your missus
all of this already.

1605
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:30,260
My missus?

1606
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:32,460
Well, yeah, yeah, um...

1607
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:33,980
Jo Noonan, right?

1608
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:36,060
- Mm-hmm.

1609
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:38,380
I didn't realize
you and she had talked.

1610
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:40,100
Pretty gal.

1611
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:41,220
How is she?

1612
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:43,860
She, uh...

1613
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:45,900
She passed away.

1614
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:51,660
Sorry to hear that.

1615
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:54,140
What did you two talk about?

1616
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:57,020
Oh, nothing much.

1617
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:59,980
She had a bunch of questions
about the history

1618
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:01,220
of Dark Score Lake.

1619
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:04,380
Said she wanted to write an
article or a book or something.

1620
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:09,420
Did she want to know
about Dark Score fair in 1939...

1621
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:12,980
And Sara Tidwell?

1622
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:16,660
Among other things, yeah.

1623
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:19,580
But I told her...

1624
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:22,180
I don't know anything.

1625
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,860
But you were lying to her,
weren't you?

1626
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:26,020
Hmm?

1627
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:28,220
You do know something.

1628
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:30,740
I bet there's lots of things you know

1629
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:35,300
you wish you could just forget, hmm?

1630
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:40,940
Max Devore is dead now, Edgar.

1631
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:42,620
He can't hurt you anymore.

1632
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:47,500
That's not always true.

1633
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:50,780
Tell me the secret of Max Devore

1634
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:55,620
that you keep in your heart
after all these years.

1635
02:01:57,660 --> 02:02:00,460
Tell me, Edgar.

1636
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:02,540
Tell me what happened...

1637
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:11,420
To you, Max Devore... And Sara Tidwell.

1638
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:13,620
It's not about what happened

1639
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:16,780
between me and Devore
and Sara Tidwell.

1640
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:18,780
[Softly] What is it, then?

1641
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:22,300
It's about what we did.

1642
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:25,460
Tell me.

1643
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:27,820
Just tell me.

1644
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:31,260
It was the summer of '39...

1645
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,340
[Brassy jazz music]

1646
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:35,180
At the Dark Score fair.

1647
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:38,100
¶ she was poor...

1648
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:42,540
Sara Tidwell was performing
on the main stage.

1649
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:44,940
And she was like nothing

1650
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:48,300
we had ever seen before
around these parts.

1651
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:54,060
it was me, Fred Dean,

1652
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:59,220
Normal Jellison,
your grandfather Harold Noonan,

1653
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:02,100
and mad Max Devore.

1654
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:06,500
Even then, Max was
the man with the plan.

1655
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:09,500
And everyone knew
that he would eventually

1656
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:12,940
run Dark Score Lake

1657
02:03:12,980 --> 02:03:16,500
and become a very rich
and important man in the world.

1658
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:19,940
It was Max's idea to go to the show.

1659
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:21,220
¶ He took her in...

1660
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:26,060
We were all heat up from the show.

1661

¶ A small port wine

1662
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:32,100
and it was Max who suggested
we pay Sara a visit afterwards.

1663
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:40,140
Of course, none of us knew
what Max had planned.

1664
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:43,220
At least that's what
I've been telling myself

1665
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:45,300
all these years.

1666
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:47,420
I liked your show.

1668
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:52,940
Well, thank you, sugar.

1669
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:54,740
Maybe I'll see you at the next one.

1670
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:56,500
I'm talking to you, girl.

1671
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:57,740
Don't you turn away from me.

Liking my singing
doesn't buy you a right to me.

Stop her!

1675
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:15,140
You think you can sing the way you do

1676
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:16,580
and get away with it, huh?

1677
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:19,060
You think you and your
kind can boil our blood

1678
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:21,940
and not give us what we want
when you're done, huh?

1679
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:25,700
Come here.

1680
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:28,380
Get over here and help me
hold her down, damn it.

You going to tell me
you're sorry, bitch?

1685
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:42,300
You going to beg me for forgiveness?

Get her.

You think we can leave any witnesses?

Even I can't get us out of this one.

1703
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:23,620
Now catch that little girl
and take her out to the lake.

what you've done to mine.

to murder their daughters.

that we could never mention

a word of it to anyone

1731

for as long as we lived,

1732
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,700
that it would ruin us all.

1733
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:19,060
He had us bury their bodies
out in the woods.

1734

02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:44,060
Will you read me
my bedtime story, please?

1753

Sweetheart, I told you,
no begging Mr. Mike.

Okay, Mike.

1800
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:12,460
It's a deal.
It's a deal.

1801
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,840
How is she?

1802
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:37,440
She's good.
She's, uh...

1803
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:39,120
Out like a light.

1804
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:43,200
[Sighs] What's the matter?

1805
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:46,560
She, uh... I don't know...
She mentioned something

1806
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:49,200
- about a little girl named Kisha.
- Oh, yeah.

1807
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:50,680
That's her imaginary friend, Kisha,

1808
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,880
but it's okay, 'cause the doctor said

1809
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:54,440
that she's perfectly normal
and I don't have a crazy kid,

1810
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:56,200
so that's...
That's good.

1811
02:12:58,880 --> 02:12:59,800
So the funeral?

1812
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:02,240
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have made you go.

1813
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:03,440
No, no, no, no, no,
actually that's been the

1814
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:04,600
best part of the last
couple of days for me...

1815
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:08,280
Seeing that old bastard lowered
into the ground once and for all.

1816
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:10,680
- Yeah.
- I, um...

1817
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:15,480
I learned about the disappearance

1818
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:17,920
of Sara Tidwell today

1819
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:21,040
from an old man in a rest home,

1820
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:25,520
who, it turns out, Jo had also
visited before she died.

1821
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:30,640
Do you know who Sara Tidwell is?

1822
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:34,280
Lance, my husband, used
to listen to her music before...

1823
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:40,080
I, uh... I didn't know
she disappeared.

1824
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:42,520
In 1939.

1825
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:44,640
Only she didn't really
disappear... she was killed.

1826
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:47,160
After she played
at the Dark Score fair one day,

1827
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,480
she was raped.

1828
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:54,360
And then she and
her little daughter, Kisha,

1829
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:56,000
were killed by a group of teenagers,

1830
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,320
led by the young Max Devore.

1831
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:00,680
Oh, my God.

1832
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,800
Which would explain why...

1833
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,600
Lance got interested in her music

1834
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,320
before he tried to kill Kyra.

1835
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:10,480
Tell me.

1836
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:14,200
A curse...

1837
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:18,640
On all the young men who killed
Sara Tidwell and her little girl.

1838
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:22,040
With her dying breath,

1839
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:24,360
she cursed them all.

1840
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:29,320
If they or any of their
descendants had daughters...

1841
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:34,720
They would do the same horrible
things to their little girls

1842
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:37,320
that they had done to Sara Tidwell

1843
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:39,160
and her little girl.

1844
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:42,560
Their descendants included
Buddy Jellison

1845
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:44,960
and Bill Dean's fathers.

1846
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:47,880
[Thunder booms]

1847
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:50,040
That explains why they drowned
their daughters

1848
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:52,120
all those years later.

1849
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:55,880
One of that group was
my grandfather, Harold Noonan...

1850
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:58,560
No!
Please.

1851
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:02,160
Who willed the lake house
to Jo and myself.

1852
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:06,320
Did your father murder your sister?

1853
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:08,080
- No, no, no,
I-I didn't have any sisters.

1854
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:10,320
There was just Sid and me.

1855
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:18,400
Oh, my God, Mike, don't you see?

1856
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,280
This is the final piece of the puzzle.

1857
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:22,960
This is why Jo didn't want
to tell you she was pregnant.

1858
02:15:23,720 --> 02:15:25,400
Jo had learned of the curse.

1859
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:27,080
That's why she had all
those library books.

1860
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:30,520
That's why she had Sara Tidwell's
albums and... and photographs.

1861
02:15:31,120 --> 02:15:33,680
It's why she went to see
that man in the rest home.

1862
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:35,920
That's why she used to visit Dark Score

1863
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,640
lake all those weekends
before she died.

1864
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:39,320
She wasn't having an affair.

1865
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:42,000
She was researching Sara Tidwell.

1866
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,920
Mike... when she thought
she might be pregnant,

1867
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:48,400
- she was worried about you.
- Worried about me?

1868
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:50,920
Worried that you might be
bound to this curse by blood.

1869
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:01,760
Thank you.

1870
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:08,240
Thank you.

1871
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:16,680
I just don't want to doubt Jo anymore.

1872
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:19,920
I just don't want to doubt her.

1873
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:36,400
[Gunshot, glass shattering]

1874
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:39,400
No, Mattie.

02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:41,000
Oh, Mattie.

1876

No, no.

1877
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:45,600
Oh, no.

1878
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:50,280
Oh, God.

1879
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:52,920
Mattie, hey, I'm here.

1880
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:55,560
I'm here.
Don't... come on.

1881
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:58,200
- T-take care of my baby.

1882
02:16:59,160 --> 02:16:59,800
I will.

1883
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:02,280
I will, Mattie.
I'll take care of Kyra.

1884
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:04,360
I promise you,
no one's going to hurt her.

1885
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:06,360
No one's going to hurt her, okay?

1886
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:08,160
Mattie...

1887
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,000
No!

I see you!

1890

Why?

1891
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,520
You killed her!

1892
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:47,440
You killed her!

1893
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:49,680
Why?
Why did you kill her?

1894
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:50,960
You should have left
well enough alone!

1895
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,840
This thing was always bigger than you.

1896
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:54,640
Bigger than Devore even.
Yeah?

1897
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:58,440
And now we need to take care of Kyra.

1898
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,240
"We" do?
Yeah.

It's the sins of the father, Mike.

1910
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:09,200
I told you to keep away from Devore.

1911
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:13,840
Devore is dead.
You can stop this now.

1912
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:17,320
No, this will only stop when
the last little girl is dead.

02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:17,340
"Down left side."

1975
02:24:18,980 --> 02:24:21,260
Well, if you've been hiding
inside my writing, then...

1976
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:24,500
"Down left side"?

1977
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:32,940
"Owls...Above...
Studio."

1978
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:35,740
"Owls above studio."

1979
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:39,980
So that's why you wanted me
to write, Jo.

1980
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:42,740
So you could send me messages
without Sara knowing...

1981
02:24:43,860 --> 02:24:45,860
Messages behind the gatekeeper's back.

1982
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:50,900
"Lie still,
bag of bones."

1983
02:24:57,860 --> 02:24:58,540
"Lye..."

1984
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:04,380
Lye.

1985
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:20,620
Lye will still her bag of bones.

1986
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,060
Owls in the studio.

1987
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:50,260
Lye...

1988
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:53,060
will still her bag of bones.

1989
02:25:55,580 --> 02:25:58,340
You hadn't figured out where those
bones were before you died...

1990
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:03,620
Or you would have done this
yourself, wouldn't you?

1991
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:05,100
Huh?

1992
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:09,740
[Thunder booms]

1993
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:10,860
Come on.

1994
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:27,700
[Groaning]

1995
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:31,660
The green lady.

1996
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:48,520
Finish it.

1997
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:57,520
[Thud]

1998
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:01,640
[Thunder booms]

1999
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:18,760
Aah!

2000
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:36,320
I am so sorry what they did
to you and your daughter, Sara.

2001
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:43,800
I am so sorry what they did
to you and your daughter, Sara.

2002
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:03,040
Leave him alone!

2003
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:08,960
His blood is cursed.

2004
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:13,000
And Devore was the worst of them.
And his blood is in that little girl.

2005
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,320
And I won't rest

2006
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:18,200
until she is dead at his hands.

2007
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:21,000
Mike and Kyra
had nothing to do with this.

2008
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:24,600
Their kin killed my baby!

2009
02:28:27,588 --> 02:28:31,388
This ends now.
It's time for you to rest.

2010
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:52,480
[Sizzling]

2011
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:24,640
We did it, Jo.

2012
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:30,640
You did it.

2013
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:35,240
[Mouths words] I love you.

2014
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:37,440
I love you.

2015
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:42,520
[Mouths words] I love you.

2016
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:19,440
Kyra?

2017
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:26,880
What are you doing, Kyra?

2018
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,200
What the lady tells me to do.

2019
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:32,520
No, no, no, no, honey.
They're at rest now.

2020
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:35,360
Sara and Kisha
are at rest, sweetheart.

2021
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:36,760
Not Sara.

2022
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:38,240
Her.

2023
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:40,760
Who?

2024
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:44,680
We do not lose,
Mr. Noonan.

2025
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:47,240
Max Devore does not lose.

2026
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:01,320
[Wailing]

2027
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:18,280
Kyra, turn away!

2028
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:32,520
[Sobbing]

2029
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:40,720
Oh, shh.
Shh.

2030
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:42,640
Shh, child.
Shh.

2031
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:44,720
It's over, baby girl.

2032
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:46,440
Oh, sweet child.

2033
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,320
No, no.

2034
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:07,800
Come now, baby girl, don't cry.

2035
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:16,600
[Smooches]

2036
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:24,160
[Whispering indistinctly]

2037
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:32,440
Bye, mommy.

2038
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:41,800
Oh, my sweet child.

2039
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:43,560
Come on.
Come on.

2040
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:44,960
Come on.

2041
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:47,080
Oh.
[Sobbing]

2042
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:55,480
Oh, no.
Oh, darling.

2043
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:59,160
We're transporting now could
you prepare the report, please?

2044
02:33:15,080 --> 02:33:16,480
Hey...

2045
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:29,040
What did mommy tell you when
she whispered in your ear?

2046
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:33,520
She told me to be a good girl

2047
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,640
and not to be sad.

2048
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:40,640
But I am sad.

2049
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:43,920
I know.

2050
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:47,160
And that's okay.

2051
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:50,280
I'm sad, too.

2052
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:55,760
But we'll be okay, I promise you.

2053
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:57,880
I promise you.

2054
02:33:59,240 --> 02:34:00,040
I know.

2055
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:03,280
You do?

2056
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:04,640
- Mm-hmm.

2057
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:07,480
Mommy told me.

2058
02:34:08,680 --> 02:34:10,520
She said I was your little girl now

2059
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:13,440
and that you're gonna take care of me.

2060
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:15,800
Did she, now?

2061
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:20,520
She told me you're ready
to be a daddy now.

2062
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:24,920
Oh, come here.

2063
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:27,320
Yeah.

2064
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:29,400
Yes.

2065
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:32,760
[Chuckles]

2066
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:37,480
Yeah.

2067
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:42,880
Should we go for a paddle
in the canoe?

2068
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:44,600
- Mm-hmm.

2069
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:45,880
Should we do that?

2070
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:48,600
- Go up the river.
- Yeah.

2071
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,080
Yeah.
Have an adventure.

2072
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,560
I think it's a good idea.
Let's go.

2073
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:56,920
Come on.
You need a piggyback.

2074
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:57,920
Piggyback.
Okay.

2075
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:01,760
[Giggles]

2076
02:35:24,258 --> 02:35:27,058
