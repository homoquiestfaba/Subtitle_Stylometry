I don't know.
I forgot the map, dude.

Don't tell me you forgot
the gold stuff, too.

You know what? I think
I've heard that shit before.

It's like total skunk, right?
Like that shit gets you high!

No, Zack, no. The pans.

We're gonna pan for gold.
Dude, it was your idea.

Oh, yeah. Gold.

18
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:44,876
Okay, look. I looked up
stuff on the Net and stuff,

19
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,662
and I found, like, these historic
sites where you still find gold.

20
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,533
Look, it's really cool.Right on.

21

You want a historic sight?

Just keep your eye
on, uh, Kate and me.

Mmm...
Yeah.

25
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,677
Hey, what if we did find gold,

26
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,592
and we struck it, like, totally rich?

27
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:07,769
I'd buy the Sea-Quarium, dude,
where Shamu lives,

28

make a bong out of it.
[laughs]

What if you were Shamu?

Well, first, I'd buy
a tan like Vicky.

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,265
And then, I don't know,
I'd travel for a couple years.

I wanna buy a house
and settle down one day.

Maybe Kate and I...

00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,104
settle down
and have us some children.

40
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:42,412
Oh, really.
[Riff] I'd like to do a little baby-making.

Keep your pants on.
I was just dreaming.

42
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:51,378

Well, I'd save the animals.

Come on, Ash!
That is so lame!

44
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,600
No, it's not.
Whatever. You would go shopping.

How about you, Vicky?

46
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,779
I would buy a set of boobs

47
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,435
and a really hot convertible.

48
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,656
Then another bigger set of boobs.

Dude, you said turn right.
I took a right.

51
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:19,362
Get the shit out of your ears, dude.
I said, "Turn right here." Left.

52
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:23,671
All right, look.
This is too complex for me.

53
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:25,237
Dude, maybe you should drive again.

54
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,947
That's what I'm talking about.
It must mean "campsites."

Told ya I knew what I was doing.

56
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,908
Uh, campsites?
I don't think so, guys.

00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,744
Yo, I'm not camping out here.

58

Whoa. Look.

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,415

What?

60
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,677

61
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,988

for the dearly departed.

Um, we're lost, and I don't
even know why I came here.

67
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,875
You're here because you begged
me to come with my crazy friends

68

were out of town.

Right on down there
where y'all come from.

All the way back there
to where you come from.

Can you help us or not?

Yeah, we heard this place called
The Heathers was the spot.

77

by the river.

No people, no rules.

Is that what you're looking for?

Where what happened?

81
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,867

One for each year of his life.

your wheels hit the water.

Where's town?
See that building over there?

That's town.

Out of town.

Come on, Pig. We gotta get a
couple of holes in 'fore dinner.

[Vicky] What?

156
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:14,674
Oh, I just totally got a vision, dude.

157
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:17,154
Of him actually shitting us.

158
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,852

Zack, they named the place after you.

Yeah. "Beer."

your tent real far from mine.

348
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:59,927
Unless, of course, you don't mind
the screamin' when Riffy gets a stiffy.

349
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,798
[laughs]

350
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:04,758
Uh... I mean, I'm screwed, dude.

351
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:08,849
I... I got two chicks in my tent.

352
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,810
You think like you throw, man.

353
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,246
Lame-o!

354
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,466
Did you even hear what you just said?
Come here.

355
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,949
I mean, is that head of yours so full of
smoke your brain got squeezed out or something?

356
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:25,213
You're complaining about having
to sleep with two chicks, man.

357
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:27,911
Those opportunities
don't just fall out of the sky.

358
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:32,089
Listen, listen.
I got two words for you: threesome.

359
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:35,092
[chuckles]
That's like four wo...

360
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:37,530
All right, bu...
Fuck. You serious?

361
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,010
You think those two girls would
want to get down like that?

362
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:43,797
Yeah.
Are you down for that?

363
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,495
Am I down for that?
Please!

364
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,889
That's what I'm talking about, boy.

365
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:51,674
Dude, you have any idea
how long I can hold my breath?

366
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:52,762

367
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,503

I could never hurt you.

Maybe... Mother...

1088
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:50,969

she always loved Simon more.

1089
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:54,190
I was the firstborn!

1090
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:58,455
I had a birthright!
I was the chosen one!

1091
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:11,729
And then, when they found out
that Simon wasn't all there,

1092
01:10:12,904 --> 01:10:18,344
Mother tortured herself every day!

1093
01:10:18,388 --> 01:10:22,348
It was like I didn't even exist!

1094
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:27,701
I was nothin' more
than Simon's shadow!

1095
01:10:32,489 --> 01:10:36,623
Well, we're gonna be sharing

1096
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:39,670

Stanley, you can still get help.

1100
01:10:51,595 --> 01:10:53,336
There's still people
who can help you.

1101

The only person that can help me...

1102

is right here.

1103
01:11:04,085 --> 01:11:08,394
We can do what you want.
We can do more. Just untie my hands.

1104
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:12,485
That sounds like a real good idea.

1105
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:17,577
If I was stupid!
Like Simon!

1106
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:19,927
You're not stupid, Stanley.

1107
01:11:19,971 --> 01:11:22,843
You were always the best.
Simon always looked up to you.

1108
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:26,369
I know everyone paid attention to him,
but he always looked up to you.

1109
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:29,415
Yes, sir.
[moans]

1110
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:32,462

01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,906
Right. Mm-hmm.

1113

Y-Y-Yeah.

1114
01:11:47,912 --> 01:11:49,522
Promise I won't go anywhere.

1115
01:11:53,657 --> 01:11:58,444
Besides, it looks like your
friend wants me to touch him.

1116
01:12:12,502 --> 01:12:14,765
Stanley, untie my hands.

1117
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:28,909
Don't worry about her.
She can't see us.

1118
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:34,132
And we'll be real quiet.

1119
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:36,526
And if anything hurts, then I'll
kiss it and I'll make it all better.

1120
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:37,831
Come on, Stanley.

1121
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:40,312
You've worked really hard for this.

1122
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:44,534
And it's time someone
paid attention to you.

1123
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,383
What if I need two hands?

1124
01:13:17,436 --> 01:13:19,917
You like it rough?
I can be real rough.

1125
01:13:23,573 --> 01:13:26,576
You know, pleasure
and pain are so close,

1126
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:28,447
sometimes you can't
even tell them apart.

1127
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:34,410
You've had too much pain, Stanley.

1128
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:38,675
It's time for pleasure.

Look at me, Stanley.

1134
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,318
Do you like that?

1135
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:19,933
Give me your hand.
