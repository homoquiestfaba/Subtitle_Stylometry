00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,170
<i>This is Battalion 13.</i>

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,756
<i>Uh, we've just been taken out.
We got bottles through the windows.</i>

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,886
<i>Uh, I'd like to pull all our stations
to the point that...</i>

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,638
<i>The largest civil unrest
California has ever...</i>

8
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:21,438
<i>Free the water! Free the water! Free the water!</i>

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>The Clearwater riots
are now headed toward down...</i>

12
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,610
<i>Free the water! Free the water!</i>

14
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,407
<i>Welcome to Union Calafia,</i>

15
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,576
<i>the West Coast's favorite bank.</i>

16
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,623
<i>Welcome... Welcome to Union Calafia,</i>

17
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,750
<i>the West Coast's favorite bank.</i>

00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,795
<i>Welcome... Welcome to Union Calafia...</i>

19
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,632
<i>The body count is rising fast...</i>

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>...and the question has to be asked:</i>

21
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,928
<i>is anywhere safe
in Los Angeles tonight?</i>

23
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,557
Goddamn it! We're still not through.

24
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,017
This job is a giant...

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,268
Fuck off, man!

26
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,978
I thought you said
you could get us in!

27
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,689
Yeah, and I thought you knew
how to run a bank job, fat boy!

28
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,607
Three minutes.

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,320
No! No! I've had it with this shit!

30
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,569
You! Look at me! You!

31
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,280
Open the fucking vault now!

32
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,490
I can't!

33
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,867
Central office controls it!

34
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,245
Hang on, whoa, whoa. All right, wait.

35
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,538
That vault's not opening
any time soon.

36
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:21,957
This is...

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,458
So, what now, huh?

38
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,919
You work with what you got,
not what you hoped for.

39
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,879
And we've got them.

40
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,881
A bunch of maids and grasscutters?

41
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,091
Exactly.

42
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,427
Okay, everyone. You're here 
in the middle of a riot...

43
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,137
...and I've got a theory about that.

44
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,266
I need you to stand up
if your boss is a millionaire.

45
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,478
Come on. That's it.

46
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,649
Now, stay standing
if your boss is an asshole.

47
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,280
Good for you.

48
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,073
How is this helping?

49
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,200
<i>Gracias.</>

50
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,371
It's the most violent riot
in LA history.

51
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,623
Rich folks need to get
their lootables to the bank.

52
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,916
Who do they use for that?

53
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,461
A bunch of maids and grasscutters.

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,339
- Two minutes till the cops show up.
- Okay, okay, I get it, man.

55
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,425
All right, change of plans!

56
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,509
Keep what you can carry...

57
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,094
- ...let's go!
- No, no, no, wait!

58
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,012
What about the vault?

59
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,972
Just blow out
the fucking back wall! Now!

60
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,300
- You know what to do, come on!
- Fucking amateurs!

62
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,768
<i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>
Thank you. <i>Gracias.</i>

63
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,978
Give that to me!

64
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,604
Thank you for your service and shit.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,356
Keep moving, bruh!

67
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,569
That's real nice.

68
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,071
Oh, believe me, you don't want it.

69
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,574
Now I really do.

70
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,950
- Buke, blow out the back wall! Now!
- I'm on it! Jesus Christ.

73
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,589
This is not what I signed up for!

74
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,508
Ah, yeah, great move.

75
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,344
Great move, Sherm.
Right into a fucking riot!

76
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,511
That's right.

77
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,721
The crowd gets us to Wilshire.

78
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,514
That's where the backup
wheelman's waiting for us.

79
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,808
Hey! So you had this whole
other plan you didn't tell us?

80
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,101
You're not my crew.

81
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,394
I don't know you, I don't trust you.

82
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,772
- What about your brother?
- We need to move.

83
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,023
Hey, man, that's not your call!

84
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,524
Hey, big brother says
we gotta fucking...

85
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,444
- I'm running this game!
- You fucking piece of shit!

86
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,988
Riot control is coming right now,
cut this shit out!

87
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,656
- Hey, hey!
- Hit the ground!

88
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,326
- Hit the ground now!
- Oh, shit!

89
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,411
You hit the fucking ground!

91
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,917
- Landon, stay down!
- Ah, fuck!

92
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,627
Shit!

95
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,973
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

96
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,184
No, stop! Stop!

97
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,646
You never listen!

100
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,819
Fuck!

101
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,697
What the fuck do we do now, Sherman?

102
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,907
I got a plan.

103
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,743
I need to make a call.

108
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,854
Hello. How can I help?

109
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,481
Ah. Well, how many?

110
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,484
Yeah, I got two rooms left.

111
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,570
Yeah, travel safe.

112
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,000
Screen!

113
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,004
<i>Thirty-six hours ago,
the Clearwater Corporation...</i>

114
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>...cut off the public water supply
in greater Los Angeles.</i>

116
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,510
<i>That has ignited the most violent riot
in California history.</i>

118
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,262
<i>Contractor ProShield has announced...</i>

119
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,056
<i>...a mandatory curfew for all citizens
of greater Los Angeles.</i>

120
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,601
Just another Wednesday. Mute!

147
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,135
Showtime.

148
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,431
Jesus fucking Christ,
it fucking hurts!

150
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,642
There she is.
We're gonna be all right.

151
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,811
We got a Code Red
and a possible Code Gray!

152
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,105
I'm gonna need a gurney
down here tout damn suite!

153
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,940
Hey, come on. Give me
a hand here. He's blacked out.

154
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,109
I got a bullet in my neck,
okay, Sherman?

155
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,777
Seriously, I feel like I'm gonna die!

156
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,821
Easy, fellas. Everybody's
gonna get fixed up.

157
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,114
You, lose the heat.

158
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,160
- Drop the fucking gun, man.
- Fuck. All right!

161
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,290
All right, now verify your memberships
and we're off to the races.

163
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,296
You're peachy.
How about the nogoodnik?

165
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,883
Ah, he's fine, too.

166
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,010
You're up, neckhole. Swipe.

168
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,681
No dice, slick.

169
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,141
This thing is covered in blood.

170
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,309
It's always covered in blood.

171
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,311
I have the fucking chip scar! Look!

172
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,104
Yeahm well, that could be
from any dark room in the country.

173
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,773
Fine. I'll pay you then, all right?

174
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,900
Ah! That's against the rules.
Yeah, I gotta run checks.

175
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,569
You could be a serial, you could be a ped,
you could be a terrorist.

176
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,071
Plenty of other hospitals out there.

177
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,989
Where the cops
are fucking looking for us.

178
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,617
You see, that's your job, lady!
To fix people like us up!

180
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,661
- Now, open the gate!
- You raising your voice to me?

181
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,204
That is also against the rules.

182
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,916
Right there in the membership pack
under "do not kill the other patients."

184
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,585
- Out of the way, Buke. Move!
- Fuck you, Sherman!

185
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,379
I'm sick of your shit!

186
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,672
Everest!

187
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,050
What now, huh?

189
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,722
You know why they call him Everest?

190
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,724
Yeah, I think you do.

192
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,525
Hold on!

193
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,110
Everest, incoming.

195
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,282
Give him a shot and take him
out the Spring Street exit.

196
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,619
- That's a long way.
- You need the exercise.

197
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,373
I'm gonna find you, Sherman!
And I swear...

199
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,545
Everything's fine, bro. Come on.

200
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:06,963
We're safe here.

201
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,132
Your brother's got
multiple entry wounds,

202
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,008
significant blood loss,
and an air-conditioned liver.

203
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,594
- Hang in there, man.
- Okay, code names.

204
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,681
He's Honolulu.
That makes you Waikiki.

205
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,350
- You know the way by now.
- Yeah, I do.

206
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,602
What's your damage?

207
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,565
Three shots, .45 millimeters.
The vest caught two.

209
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,358
Feels like a third slug got luckier.

210
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,020
I got Sydolan.

211
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,195
That'll keep you
on your feet for now.

212
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,488
Yeah, thanks.

213
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,824
I thought you were done
with all this.

214
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,453
I got out for a minute there, but...

215
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,246
...you know how it goes.

216
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,124
You were never out. Not up here.

217
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,084
Kept paying your membership.

219
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,632
Screen! Put him there
under the light!

220
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>Initiated.</i>

221
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,053
Okay, Alpha,
give me a hepatic scan.

222
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,765
Beta, expose and clean the wound.

223
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,308
<i>Liver scan commencing.</i>

225
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,103
Hey, I'm right here.
Right here. You all right?

226
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,485
Ah, man. I puked on my new suit.

227
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,153
We'll get you another one.

228
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,197
Without all the holes in it.

229
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,533
Wait a minute. What's that?

230
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,050
Consider it a thank you...

231
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,622
<i>Liver irreparable.</i>

232
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,457
Could you be more careful, please?

233
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,875
Want me to leave
the bullets in there?

234
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,543
You wanna help?

235
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,921
Why don't you hold his hand,
tell him you love him,

236
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,799
and then drench that vein in super glue
so the drip don't tear.

238
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,258
You fucking kidding me?

239
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,594
I'm about to play laser tag
inside his rib cage.

240
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,638
So he needs as much of the good shit
as we can get in there.

241
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,264
Especially with
what's coming up next.

242
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,725
His new liver.

243
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,477
<i>3-D model accepted.</i>

244
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,771
<i>Internal call. Acapulco suite.</i>

245
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,897
Pick up!

246
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,733
Hello, Mr. Acapulco.

247
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,109
<i>Oh, don't patronize me, okay?</i>

248
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,195
<i>I've got an eyeball that's falling out
of my fucking face!</i>

249
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,530
<i>I need you here now!</i>

250
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,114
Yeah, well, I'll be
with you momentarily.

251
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,450
Why don't you help yourself
to some morphine? End call!

252
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,952
Asshole, room number four.

253
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,329
Fuck.

254
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,457
Power outage.

255
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,834
It's probably just riot control.

256
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,377
You know, we got another generator.

257
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,711
Is this place gonna hold up?

258
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,840
Son, me and the Artemis,
we've been here for 22 years.

259
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,130
See?

260
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,678
Just another Wednesday.

261
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,556
<i>Biopsy in progress.</i>

262
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,682
It's okay.

263
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,101
Here she goes.

264
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,355
<i>Commence printing.</i>

266
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,572
<i>This is not a drill!</i>

267
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,741
<i>Los Angeles is under
ProShield jurisdiction!</i>

268
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,451
<i>You out there, big guy?</i>

269
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,536
Yes, Nurse.

270
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,788
<i>All right, I hate to interrupt
your field trip,</i>

271
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,582
<i>but the cops killed the grid.</i>

272
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,417
Shit. That backup's older than you.

273
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,377
<i>Yeah, yeah. Just head up to the roof...</i>

275
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,879
<i>...and keep this place
Christmas-y, will ya?</i>

277
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,548
Can't you do it?

278
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,426
<i>You know I'm not going
out there. I just can't.</i>

279
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,803
Oh. What about that
anxiety tape I got you?

280
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,639
<i>Nah, those things
don't work. Now, go on.</i>

281
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,308
<i>Get your fat ass
up there right now.</i>

282
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,475
I'm not fat.

283
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,353
- <i>Right now!</i>
- Yes, Nurse.

286
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,739
Come on, man. Really?

287
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,951
Fuck do you think you are just
leaving me out here?

288
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,413
Hey, you see that badge?

289
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,042
That means I'm
a healthcare professional.

290
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,169
But that knowledge goes both ways.

291
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,297
So if you tell anybody
about the Artemis,

292
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,551
I will hunt you down
and un-heal the shit out of you.

294
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,596
No, wait!

295
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,349
And also, when I walk away,

296
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,643
don't jump on my back again, okay?

297
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,312
If you do, I'm gonna fuck you up
for real this time.

298
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,483
Please! I got a hole in my neck, man!

299
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,109
So apply for membership.

300
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,363
Don't do this!
The riot's headed this way!

301
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,282
- Have a good night.
- I'm dead out here!

302
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,496
<i>Keep Los Angeles
in your prayers tonight.</i>

303
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,082
<i>It is a vision of hell
out here on the streets...</i>

305
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,020
Fuck!

306
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,755
Hey, can I give you a suggestion?

307
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,880
You know, you might want to buy
some scented candles or something,

309
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,719
'cause it smells like somebody
fucking died in here.

310
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,222
- They did.
- Oh, of course they did.

311
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,682
How you feeling, Mr. Acapulco?

312
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,849
Oh, how am I feeling?

313
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,977
What a great question. Let's see.

314
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,937
Like I got stabbed in the back...

316
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,899
...and somebody
ripped off half my face.

317
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,236
Now, these keloid scars mean
that the nanites are doing their job.

318
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,571
- So, if you look over there...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

319
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,782
I know what nanites are.
What about my fucking eye?

320
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,036
I'm sorry, buster. Partial sight.

321
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,705
But, you know, there's experts
out there that can...

322
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,914
Are you kidding me?

323
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,083
Well, what the fuck
am I paying you for, then?

324
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,790
From the looks of all the nail polish
that I took out of your cheekbone,

326
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,922
I'd say you're paying me
for discretion.

327
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,757
Oh, that's great, you're a comedian.

328
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,010
Oh! Jesus.

329
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,887
Hey, are we safe in here?
From doomsday?

330
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,306
I mean, are these walls
fortified with anything?

331
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,685
- Those people are animals.
- They just want clean water.

332
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,640
Well, then they can get a fucking job
and pay for water like the rest of us.

334
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,482
You don't like that?

335
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,359
You one of those
bleeding-heart types?

336
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,900
Well, hey, cops kill poor people,
poor people kill cops.

338
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,656
That's the circle of life.
Hakuna matata.

339
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,868
These are for the robots
swimming in your optic canal.

340
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,454
Take one in an hour and then
after that, you can go.

341
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,538
All right. Hey!

342
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,791
Uh, my TV's broken.
I want to watch the riots.

343
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,626
There's an old one in the game room.

344
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,961
It's hardwired.
It should be working.

345
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,046
Hey, hang on.

346
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,131
You want me to go out there
with the criminals?

347
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,300
Hakuna matata, buddy.

348
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,596
Oh, that's cute.

350
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,349
No water in LA, but it's raining
assholes in here.

351
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,977
<i>Excusez-moi?</i> Nurse lady?

352
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,395
My TV broke.

353
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,856
Oh, yeah? Sorry to hear that.

354
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,777
You wanna kill yourself quicker than
that .45 in your bicep?

355
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,613
Why don't you try sparking up
a Gitanes in my hospital?

356
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,825
How's that arm doing, hmm?

357
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,495
It hurts. A lot.

358
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,300
Well...

359
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,708
...thankfully, you did
a pretty precise job.

360
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,793
Kudos.

361
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,628
Inch lower and you might
have lost use of that hand.

363
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,882
What are you trying to say?

364
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,258
This is America, honey.

365
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,512
Eighty-five percent of
what I fix is bullet holes.

366
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,891
Entrance angles, muzzle burns.
<i>Je suis un connoisseur.</i>

367
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,040
You checked yourself in here.

368
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,273
I needed someplace
quiet... for a while.

370
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,860
Hotel Artemis is
a great place to hide.

371
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,155
You know those will kill you, right?

373
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,909
You sound like my mother.

374
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,910
I tell her my job is stressful,
she tells me to get another one.

376
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,998
That's tough to argue,

377
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,542
especially on a night like tonight.

378
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,711
This is what I do.

379
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,839
You can't pick what you're good at.

381
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,181
Goddamn it.

385
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,045
Connect secure line, Detroit client.

386
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,299
<i>Contact initiated.</i>

387
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,634
<i>Motor City Waste Disposal.</i>

388
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,178
I'm in position.

389
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,800
But I had to fucking shoot myself
to get close enough to the target,

391
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,518
so I need extra compensation.
Reconfirming job.

392
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,980
- <i>Job reconfirmed.</i>
- <i>Parfait.</i>

393
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,525
<i>However, in failure,
the company bears no liability...</i>

394
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,278
<i>...for asset's medical,
travel, or legal fees.</i>

396
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,409
Disconnect.

397
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,519
How's he doing?

398
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,772
You want the good news
or the bad news?

399
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,523
Let's start with the good news.

400
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,108
There isn't any.

401
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,029
These 3-D printed livers,
they're sketchy in the best of times.

402
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,073
When you clone them
with the toxic tissue...

403
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,574
What does that mean, toxic?

404
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,327
Dictionary definition of...

405
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,206
That's not ice cream
he's been shooting in there.

406
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,833
Shit.

407
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,377
Yeah.

408
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,672
When you boys move,

409
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,091
he's gonna need a really heavy
tranquilizer for the pain.

410
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,301
Like the kind they give
to baby elephants.

411
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,761
Right.

412
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,847
No, I'm serious. Real baby elephants.

413
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,724
This shit will kill most people.

414
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,936
Come on. Sit down.

416
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,940
Let's see how you're doing.

417
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,234
First, we'll crank up these nanites.

419
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,656
You know, he told me he quit.

421
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,618
Did I ever tell you
about that beagle I had?

422
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,370
Marvin?

423
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,039
Not that I recall.

425
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,585
Marvin was not a good dog.
Always playing in traffic.

426
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,090
Yeah, I loved that dog. Too much.

427
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:58,137
Anyway, I kept fixing up
his cuts and his bruises...

428
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,972
...and his broken bones
year after year, and then...

429
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,182
...I turned my back, and bam!

430
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,643
Eighteen-wheeler
took him out anyway.

431
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,690
I get it. You're more
of a cat person.

432
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,861
I gotta keep moving.

433
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,906
Remember, everybody's got
their 18-wheeler day.

434
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,826
Thank you.

435
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,829
Again.

436
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,539
Yeah.

439
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,851
Hello. How can I help?

440
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,353
<i>Shut the fuck up
and listen, lady...</i>

441
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,520
Nope.

442
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,231
Hello?

443
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,649
<i>How dare you hang up on me?</i>

444
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,776
- <i>You fucking can't...</i>
- Ah!

445
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,000
You're a rude little prick.

446
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,279
Hello?

447
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,114
It's for Orian Franklin.

448
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,869
<i>Yeah, now you're listening.</i>

449
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,330
<i>He's 52 minutes out,
and he needs a room.</i>

450
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,664
That's too far.

451
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,666
Fix him someplace closer.
He owns half the city.

452
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,044
<i>He says he always comes to you
for emergencies.</i>

453
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,297
But... Yeah, that's true.
But rules are rules.

454
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,092
If someone else gets here first,
I can't hold the last room for him.

455
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,969
You do remember who Mr. Franklin
fucking is, right?

456
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,180
- <i>He owns you.</i>
- Listen...

457
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,599
...this hotel was built
on two things:

458
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,477
man's fundamental avarice and trust.

459
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,145
Now, I break the rules in here, and...

460
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,524
...nasty people got
<i>carte blanche</i> to do the same.

461
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,151
Your boss, he knows that
better than anybody.

462
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,440
- Hello? You still there?
- <i>He's not my boss...</i>

463
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,824
...he's my father.

464
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,078
And if you won't hold a room for him,
I'll come there and do it for you.

467
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,043
Nothing fat about my ass.

468
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,546
Been on that diet, like,
three fucking days.

469
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,965
Don't know who
she's calling a fat ass.

470
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,302
Oh, great.

471
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,265
<i>Everest, where the hell are you?</i>

472
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,309
I'm on the roof
where you told me to be.

473
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,771
<i>Still? Enjoying yourself?</i>

474
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,023
No, 'cause it's a war zone up here.

475
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,401
Missiles going off,
drones everywhere,

476
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,111
helicopters exploding and shit.

477
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,822
<i>Maybe you got the right idea
about never going out.</i>

478
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,739
Screen!

479
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,868
You are my rock, big man.
Now get your ass down here.

480
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,287
We got another Code Red coming.
Half an hour out.

482
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,332
<i>Seriously? With all this happening,
we're taking someone else in?</i>

483
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,461
Just another Wednesday.

484
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,212
No, it's not just another Wednesday.

485
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,839
The noise you're hearing out there,

486
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,716
that's some hardcore
riot control shit.

487
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,344
Hey, you put your dirty boots
on the sofa in your own house?

488
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,971
Oh, hey, go fuck yourself.

490
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,560
Hello? You still there?

491
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,396
Listen... that riot,

492
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,065
<i>it's headed right for
the Clearwater building.</i>

493
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,734
<i>That's three blocks away.</i>

494
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,986
<i>We might have
to evacuate for real.</i>

495
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,696
We're 12 floors up,

496
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,449
in a safe-core made of
chromium and carbon fiber.

497
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,700
We're peachy.

498
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,536
<i>Now, hurry up.
Code Red's coming in hot.</i>

499
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,915
<i>These protesters are now headed
toward downtown LA.</i>

501
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,959
<i>Their target is the headquarters
of the multi-national company...</i>

503
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,253
<i>...behind water privatization
here in California.</i>

504
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,631
<i>ProShield has
the legal right to open fire...</i>

505
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,674
<i>...at the first signs of aggression.</i>

506
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,468
<i>And from what we are seeing
on the ground,</i>

507
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,136
<i>that is the only way
law will be returned...</i>

508
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,722
<i>One cup remains. Please refill.</i>

509
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,100
<i>Please refill. Please refill.</i>

511
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,109
Nice.

512
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,403
It's pronounced "Neece."

513
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,657
I was talking about your ass,
not your room allocation.

515
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,910
Fucking animals.

516
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,663
Yeah, ha, ha, ha.
Laugh it up, Frenchie.

517
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,414
But those slum rats out there,

518
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,750
they're slinging Balzalt 500
rocket launchers...

519
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,127
...and not one of them
can aim for shit.

520
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,712
Believe me, I know.

521
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,258
Aftershave, hair spray, flop sweat.

522
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,717
You're an arms dealer, right?

523
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,719
What's this? You're gonna
give me a superior act?

524
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,680
It's not an act.

525
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,808
I tell you what. I'm a friendly guy.

526
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,479
But don't push my buttons.
Don't you do that.

527
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,691
Please. You're nothing
without your toys.

528
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,652
Oh, well, who says
I don't have any toys?

529
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,321
But let me ask you something.

530
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,655
What would people like you even be
without people like me?

532
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,618
You don't know what I do.

533
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,662
Well, you're in this place,
you're talking to me,

534
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,747
so, I highly fucking doubt
you're an <i>au pair.</i>

535
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,624
But you know what gets me?

536
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,420
Here you are, you're in my country,
you're doing some lowball job,

538
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,921
and you're gonna patronize me?

539
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,881
Who the fuck are you?

540
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,552
You're a street taco,
but I'm a 20-ounce sirloin.

541
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,723
You're a housemaid with a handgun,

542
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,433
but I own the fucking mansion.

543
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,726
Your spray tan is running.

544
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,020
Oh, you're funny,
you stuck up little...

545
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,479
<i>Please refill.</i>

546
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,232
<i>Please refill. Please refill.</i>

547
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,153
They really have to make
coffee pots that speak?

548
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,030
Is that necessary?

549
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,240
Hey, uh, I'm in the middle
of a conversation...

550
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,325
...with the lady, all right?

551
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,327
It's a party for two,
so why don't you skip the fuck along?

552
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,169
You know, I'm trying real hard
to keep myself to myself,

553
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,005
but you're not gonna
make that easy for me,

554
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,715
are you, little man?

555
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,521
<i>Coming!</i>

556
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,359
Come on in.

557
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,403
Your room's a shithole.

558
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,073
Yeah. No maid service since 1976.

559
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,616
Hey, you want a treat?

560
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,410
Check out the joker
at the Flower Street door.

561
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,037
Fuck is he doing?

562
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,122
I told him I wouldn't hold a room
for his Code Red, so...

563
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,957
...it looks like he's gonna
seal up the doors.

564
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,710
Guess he's making a big show of the fact
that nobody else is getting in.

565
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,587
<i>See what I'm doing, lady?</i>

566
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,131
</>This is what I think of your rules!</i>

567
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,093
Mute! Seems kinda needy.

568
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,221
Be a major pain in my ass
trying to unseal those tomorrow.

569
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,972
We'll just have to bill his daddy.

570
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,683
He does own the place.

571
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,353
- The owner's our new Code Red?
- Yup.

572
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,356
The Wolf king of LA.

573
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,020
Such a dumb nickname.

574
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,694
Alarm's acting up again.

575
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,987
Probably those goddamn raccoons.

576
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,031
Whoa!

577
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,619
- <i>Help! Please!</i>
- Fuck me. Is that a cop?

578
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,788
- Yeah, yeah, looks like it.
- <i>Please help!</i>

579
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,207
Hell of a security breach.

580
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,210
<i>Please help me, Mrs. Thomas!</i>

581
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,587
"Mrs. Thomas"?

582
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,382
<i>Can you see me? Please help!</i>

583
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:55,470
Okay, this is a real problem.
I think I know her.

584
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,000
Okay.

585
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,477
So what the fuck's your problem?

586
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,649
Honestly, my problem is
I need a hot cup of coffee.

587
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,192
Hey, Nice.

588
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,402
Hello, Waikiki.

589
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,737
You look good.

590
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,029
You look tired.

591
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,906
- I thought you were out.
- Yeah, me too.

592
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,491
Yeah, ha, ha. Shut the fuck up.

593
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,369
You're gonna walk up on me,
trying to protect your little girlfriend?

594
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,287
Fuck you, pal!

596
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,710
This funny to you?

597
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,880
Don't do that.

598
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,465
Protect her?

599
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,300
- Look, my friend...
- Don't do that.

600
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,175
...if you knew what she could do to you
with just that cup of coffee...

602
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,805
I mean, I'm a professional, but...

603
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,308
...this woman, she's the business.

604
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,018
<i>Merci beaucoup, Sherman.</i>

605
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,229
Get your hand off the goddamn Gucc...

606
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,109
...before I shove it
right up your fucking ass.

607
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,580
You know, I'll leave you guys to it.

608
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,165
You know where to find me, right?

609
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,291
Always.

611
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,934
You can do better
than him, anyway.

612
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,064
I even like a little street meat
myself from time to time.

614
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,281
The fuck was that?

615
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,325
You're lucky this place has rules.

616
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,663
Fuck this fucking place.

618
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,416
<i>Welcome to Chopper,
your aeronautic limousine.</i>

620
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,918
I need a pick up downtown, stat!

621
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,336
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
I can barely hear you.</i>

622
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,839
Don't make me fucking repeat myself,
I'm a VIP member!

624
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,675
There's a giant pink
neon sign on the roof!

625
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,636
It says Hotel Artemis!
Get me a fucking helicopter!

626
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,139
I don't know...

627
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,225
<i>I don't know
if you're there, but please!</i>

628
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,981
<i>It's me! It's Morgan Daniels!
Can you see me?</i>

629
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,525
- You know this <i>chota</i>?
- Oh. Maybe.

630
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,611
You gotta help her.
You gotta go get her!

631
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,988
Fuck no.

632
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,365
You let her in here,
nobody trusts us ever again.

633
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,867
I know, babe.

634
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,535
You let her in while
the Wolf king's here,

635
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,703
we're fucking dead.

636
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,371
- Bangkay for real.
- Yeah.

637
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,915
Twenty years you never let anyone
in here who wasn't a member.

638
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:32,085
Now you wanna change that
for this... fucking cop?

639
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,547
Twenty-two. It's been 22 years.

640
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,553
- Oh, no. No, no, not again!
- Shit!

641
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,763
I thought you said you fixed it?

642
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,723
Yeah,

643
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,517
but riot control's blowing out
the grid for curfew.

644
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,978
- We're probably gonna black out.
- Yeah, we need that power.

645
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,606
I can... I can re-route the G9s.

646
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,982
Hotwire the generator.

647
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,775
Figure it out
when I get up there, but...

648
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,404
...forget about that <i>chota,</i> okay?

651
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,504
Hey! How's your shift?

652
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,633
Busy night at the Artemis.

653
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,217
At least we ain't out there, right?

654
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,428
Hey, you okay?
Breathing kind of funny.

655
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,639
Asthma. I gotta keep moving.

656
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,724
Right on.

660
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,731
<i>Dealing with Anxiety,
Module Two.</i>

661
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,568
<i>Breathe in and breathe out.</i>

662
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,073
<i>Breathe as if you can breathe
through your heart.</i>

663
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,409
<i>Feel your chest rise and fall,</i>

664
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,703
<i>breathing in and breathing out.</i>

665
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,997
<i>Let yourself feel the relief...</i>

666
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,541
<i>...that comes when
forgiveness is possible.</i>

667
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,793
<i>You can go where you like.</i>

668
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,131
<i>You fall asleep easily
and wake up to that...</i>

669
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,930
<i>Breathe in and breathe out.</i>

670
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,893
<i>I can easily walk outside
today and not panic.</i>

671
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,649
<i>There is no reason
to be afraid of going outside.</i>

673
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,487
<i>Breathe as if you can breathe
through your heart.</i>

675
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,867
<i>I do not allow panic to rule me.</i>

679
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,799
Oh, Jesus.

680
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,343
Oh, God.

681
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:32,348
Okay. Okay. Okay.

683
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,649
Who is this? What's his name?

684
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,074
Beau.

688
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,665
Come on, T!

689
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,000
They're fucking behind us, man!

690
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,127
Come on, T. Keep up, man! Come on!

691
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,797
- This way!
- What's that? A cop?

692
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,423
No, just leave her! Let's go!

693
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,509
No, no, no, no, no, no! Look,

694
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,928
I can help you. I can help you.

695
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,305
Here. Now, take these.

696
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,057
I'm not on anyone's side, all right?
And you're hurt.

697
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,150
Here, take that.

698
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,311
- Hands up! Right now!
- Hands or we shoot!

699
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,106
- Sarge, we got a cop down!
- What are you doing out here?

700
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,398
I live here.

701
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,192
Another fucking vagrant!
Put her in the truck!

702
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,777
No! I gotta take care of her.

703
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,153
Sarge, how should I proceed?

704
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,572
Cuff her. And if she gives you
any more shit, put her in...

708
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,000
Respect your elders, <i>pulis.</i>

709
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,673
Nurse, go inside now!

710
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,258
We gotta bring her in.

711
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,217
No!

712
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,468
<i>Remain in your homes!</i>

713
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,011
Oh, damn it, Nurse.

714
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,721
<i>This is not a drill!</i>

715
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,350
<i>Los Angeles is under
ProShield jurisdiction!</i>

716
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,020
This is a terrible idea.

719
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,996
These rioters are really
stepping up their game, huh?

720
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,709
- Double tap them to be sure.
- Is that really necessary?

721
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,044
Uh... I don't know.
What do you want to do?

722
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,630
You wanna get into heaven
or you wanna make the Wolf king happy?

723
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,674
All right.

724
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,510
Hurry up. Dad's almost here.

726
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,119
Who says he doesn't have any toys?

727
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,587
Busted.

729
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,175
I can't believe you got
his wallet before me.

730
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,553
Hotel full of criminals.
You gotta move quick.

731
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,432
I did find this in the corridor.

732
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,516
Hey!

733
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,312
I think the old lady
likes to drink.

736
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,819
So...

737
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,073
...how long has it been?

738
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,700
- You know exactly how long.
- Okay. Yeah, I do.

740
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,914
Really stacking up
those memberships, huh?

741
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,540
It's been a busy year.

742
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,918
The Dressier, Berlin.

743
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,295
The Floridita, Miami. Hotel Sazerac.

744
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,547
- That's a lot of travel.
- You should try it.

745
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,759
You could have been one of the greats
if you ever got a goddamn passport.

747
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,427
Hey, you know I only work domestic.

748
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,076
Don't make that sound like a choice.

749
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,016
You drew a line...
you knew I couldn't cross.

751
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,814
What's with the implant?

752
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,651
Oh. You noticed? That's sweet.

753
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,486
They're industry standard now.

754
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,321
Wetwork's so fancy.

755
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,573
All I get is a shotgun
and a duffel bag.

756
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,703
Well, tonight, I had to look my target
in the eye while I slit his throat,

757
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,663
so the client can watch it later...

758
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,331
...while he masturbates.

759
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,669
- That's fucking gross.
- That's what happens...

760
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,129
- ...when you only kill important people.
- When you only kill important people.

761
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,505
Yeah, I've heard that before.

762
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,258
And how was your night?

763
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,200
Well...

764
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,805
This happened.

766
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,225
<i>Oh, putain, Sherman.</i>

767
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,270
You need to leave here
right fucking now.

769
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,733
- Let's go.
- Bye, I gotta go.

770
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,286
Oh, man. This thing's
on its last legs.

771
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,454
All right.

772
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,084
So, you went outside for her?

773
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,295
Yeah.

774
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,546
How long has it been?

775
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,382
Does that make it, like, three years?

776
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,387
A little longer, maybe.
I'm not doing it again.

777
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,764
I just can't.

778
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,433
I can help you.

779
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,229
You do. You do, babe.

781
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,902
Okay, we're home. Let's go.

782
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,573
Careful, careful.
Internal bleeding. Come on.

783
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,909
You know you're risking
everything for this cop?

784
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,660
Yeah, I've got my reasons.

785
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,330
Hey, I broke the rules once before.

786
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,290
It worked out pretty good
if you remember.

787
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,669
It was different.
I was just a kid.

788
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,338
Yeah, well, so was she
when I knew her.

789
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,798
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

790
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,675
<i>Christ, open your ears,
you ignorant fuck!</i>

792
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,886
Great. Mr. Acapulco.

793
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,680
All right. Code Red's
18 minutes out.

794
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,599
So get the crash cart
and meet me in my room.

795
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,267
Radio me when the coast is clear.

796
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,185
Yes, Nurse.

797
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,190
I don't care where!
Uh, Cancun. Uh, Guadalajara!

798
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,484
Even fucking Acapulco!
I don't give a shit!

799
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,653
Just make sure there's
a fucking infinity pool,

800
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,947
and don't give me shit about
the price of water, okay?

801
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,532
I know how much fucking water costs!

802
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,249
It's bad, right?

803
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,917
You know what this is?

804
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,210
I know who it belongs to.

805
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,295
- You know what's in it?
- No idea.

806
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,799
Those things are tougher to crack
than a Teikoku vault.

807
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,719
You're a professional.
I'm the business.

809
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,973
You know what these are?

810
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,433
Yellow diamonds?

811
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,727
Yakutia Canaries.
Worth about 18 million.

812
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,895
Domestic.

813
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,605
Fuck.

814
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,024
Wolf king's probably
gonna want those back.

815
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,528
This is no joke.

816
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,071
- You know what he does to thieves.
- Yeah.

817
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,948
You need to walk straight out
the door right now.

818
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,783
I gotta wait till Lev can move.

819
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,493
It is too dangerous for you in here.

820
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:08,411
You have to trust me.

821
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,997
I do trust you.
But he's my brother.

822
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,625
There's so much more
you could have done without him.

823
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,796
You work with what you got,
not what you hoped for.

824
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,965
Go.

825
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,177
You have a lot
to live for... out there.

826
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,721
I don't know if that's true.

827
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,774
It is.

828
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,237
Go. Now.

829
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,884
All right, oxygen.
I need to get a line going.

831
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,930
Jesus. They stomped on her
like they were making Merlot.

832
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,432
She's a cop in a riot.
What'd you expect?

833
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,018
No, she's a community liaison.

834
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,269
That's what it says. That's her job.

835
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,938
Think that's how she knew about us?

836
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:17,939
Oh, I don't know.

837
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,858
Maybe she heard something,
maybe she put two and two together.

839
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,903
You know, I know her
from back in the day.

840
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,738
In the day? Before this place?

841
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,075
Yeah. All right.
I gotta go in old-school.

842
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,285
I'm gonna need a microwave scalpel,
set to two inches.

843
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,800
Yes, Nurse.

844
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,665
- Come on. Chop, chop!
- Yes, Nurse.

845
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,959
Great, prep pad. Come on.

848
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,637
<i>Nurse?</i>

849
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,724
Nurse? You okay?
Do you need to rest?

850
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,017
What? No.

851
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,395
Yeah, I'm fine.
What I need to do is work.

852
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,939
All right. You concentrate
on that suction.

853
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,607
I'm very fond of this rug.

854
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:08,155
That's it. There we go. Merlot time.

855
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,827
Yeah, '74 Chevy Nova,
parking lot on Main Street.

856
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,996
Appreciate it.

857
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
<i>Patient regaining consciousness.</i>

859
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,900
Sherm.

860
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,631
It hurts so fucking bad, man.

861
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,174
Oh, bro, you're on life support.

862
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,719
Yeah, but we scored, man.

863
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,513
And the stash is safe.

864
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,559
And me and you,
we can go somewhere nice like...

865
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,060
...like that.

866
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,398
Oh, yeah. Drinking daiquiris, man.

867
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,276
Fighting off the hula girls.

868
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,946
Till then, we in the safest
place in town.

869
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,948
No, man, daiquiris
aren't from Hawaii,

870
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,992
hula girls don't even exist,

871
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,953
and the Artemis isn't
safe for us, all right?

872
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,705
'Cause of this.

873
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,165
A pen?

874
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,042
It's not a pen.
It's a goddamn curse.

875
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,919
- Okay.
- It's a portable vault.

877
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,256
Like the ones that Malibu
mob couriers use, all right?

878
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,593
Exactly like the ones they use.

879
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,304
- Oh, fuck, man!
- That's right.

880
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,389
Fuck! We stole from the Wolf king?

881
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,891
- You did!
- But by accident, though.

882
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,852
That excuse probably won't fly
with the man who runs Los Angeles.

883
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,646
You know what he does to people
who steal from him?

884
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,814
- I do. Yup.
- He has them drowned, man.

885
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,940
Like in an ocean like this.

886
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,400
I don't float, man!

887
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,361
Calm the fuck down, okay?

888
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,113
I called in a favor.
Got us a new plan.

889
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,115
An exit strategy.

890
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,618
All we got to do is
keep our heads way down low...

891
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,827
...until we can move you.

892
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,788
Hey!

893
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,998
- Can you do that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

894
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,794
We'll be fine, man.

895
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,338
'Cause you here.

896
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,256
My big brother.

897
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,842
This is the last time.

898
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,221
Yeah.

899
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,391
I'll be right back.

900
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,228
There's something
I need to check out.

901
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,858
<i>How's it going, K-Jack?</i>

902
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,443
<i>It's a shit show out here.</i>

903
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,530
<i>Detouring to avoid the riot.
Be there in 15.</i>

905
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,450
<i>This is Bravo team.
We're five by five.</i>

906
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,662
<i>Perimeter is secure for the Wolf king.
Once he gets here, it's safe.</i>

908
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,959
- Wolf king's almost here.
- All right.

910
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,420
Let's... let's get her talking.

911
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,757
Lowering the benzo.
Here she comes.

912
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,676
Mo?

913
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,178
Mo? Hey.

914
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,599
Hey, long time no see, huh?

915
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,186
Mrs. Thomas.

916
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,980
Yeah.

917
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,318
Your house looks really different.

918
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,196
I don't know, Morgan.

921
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,453
Always with the jokes.

922
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,454
Yeah.

923
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,872
You haven't changed.

924
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,583
Well, my hair is longer.

925
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,836
Yeah. It looks nice. I like it.

926
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,548
And I get the shit kicked out
of me more these days.

927
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,800
Yeah, I spotted that.

928
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,178
You know, I thought...

929
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,889
I thought this place was a myth.

930
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,767
Good. 'Cause once
we get you back outside,

931
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,019
that's exactly what you're
gonna think all over again.

932
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:26,812
Ignore him.

933
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,440
So, you've really been here
this whole time?

934
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,734
Just fixing up criminals?

935
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,529
Well, there's plenty
of folks out there...

936
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,072
...to patch up all the good guys.

937
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,700
So why let me in?

938
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,076
Great question.

939
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:42,870
'Cause you're family.

940
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,123
Sort of.

941
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,125
That's how it felt.

943
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,214
All right, well, these staples
should hold pretty good,

944
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,716
and, uh, you just gotta be
real careful with them.

945
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,343
And to be clear,

946
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,765
I fixed up that cute,
little gal who lived next door...

947
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,974
...who was always on the trampoline.

948
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,522
I didn't fix a cop. I don't do that.

949
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,191
Yeah, I understand.

950
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,360
Mrs. Thomas, wait.

952
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,614
I am really sorry.

953
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,200
Oh. It's not your fault.

954
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,117
No, no.

955
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,789
I mean... Beau.

956
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,087
- I can't talk about it. No!
- I wanted to...

957
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,133
Mrs. Thomas, are you okay?

958
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,266
We're done here. I gotta run.

959
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,178
Get her dressed and wait for my signal.
I gotta prep Niagara.

961
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:50,855
Mrs. Thomas...

962
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,898
Yeah, Everest will walk you
through the aftercare.

963
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:54,692
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

964
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,193
It's a busy night.

980
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,860
<i>Bravo team, this is Goldcage unit,</i>

981
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,320
<i>coming in to Broadway now.</i>

982
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,844
<i>We're at one minute 30 out. Repeat:</i>

984
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,491
<i>The Wolf king
is one minute and 30 out.</i>

985
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,536
<i>Copy that, Goldcage.
We're in position.</i>

991
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,959
Ah, great. Parisian ninja bitch.

992
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,798
Look, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

993
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,718
In a minute I'm gonna be
out of your hair!

994
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,470
Is your helicopter early?

995
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,013
How do you know about that?

996
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,682
You're American.
You speak too loudly.

997
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,350
Look, I don't want
trouble, all right?

998
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,352
Hey, maybe we got off
on the wrong foot?

999
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,438
All right? I'm gonna make you an offer.

1000
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,190
I'm getting outta here.

1001
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,900
This whole city's burning down.
I'm going south...

1002
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,817
...to the wall.

1003
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,569
I don't have any security, so...

1004
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,529
...you know, I could use
some protection down there.

1005
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,656
Protecting people is
the opposite of what I do.

1006
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,742
Whatever, it's the same
skill set, though, right?

1007
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,786
Look, try this: You come with me,

1008
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,329
see how you like it down there,

1009
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,998
I don't know, one thing leads to another,
maybe something romantic happens.

1010
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,291
Yeah.

1011
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,168
You know, don't rule it out.

1012
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,755
Look, I'll pay you
a shitload of money, okay?

1014
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,176
I already have my way out.

1015
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:55,891
He's here.

1016
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,020
I'll give you a signal,
and you gotta get the girl outta there.

1018
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,000
Yes, Nurse.

1019
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,901
<i>Everest? Look after her for me.</i>

1022
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,258
Get him inside right now!

1023
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,927
Nice car. Looks like
somebody important.

1024
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,804
<i>Exactement.</i>

1025
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,139
I only kill important people.

1026
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,142
Shut the fuck up. That's your mark?

1027
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,727
Well, he just waltzed
right in here.

1028
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,020
I think he's gonna be fine.

1029
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,314
Or I needed to get him on his own.

1030
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,234
Wait a second.
You put your mark in here?

1037
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,350
Open the gate!

1038
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,644
Guys, only six people
maximum in that thing.

1039
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,812
You're killing me here.

1040
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,731
I said open the fucking gate.

1041
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,482
The Wolf king is in the building.

1042
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,318
<i>He's your one priority now!

1043
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:30,903
<i>Now let us in!</i>

1044
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,239
<i>Yeah, one thing at a time.</i>
Everybody lose the heat.

1045
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,782
No, he needs to be protected.

1046
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,534
Okay. It's a little late
for that, sport.

1047
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:38,619
I told you there are rules.

1048
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,538
- I talked about this with...
- Rules, rules, rules.

1051
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,458
You say rules?

1052
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,085
Jeanie, without the rule-breakers,

1053
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,296
honey, where would you be?

1054
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,381
You look like death.

1055
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,384
I guess my ballroom days
are over, baby.

1056
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,304
Wow, look at you.

1057
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,556
Jesus Christ, swipe.

1059
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,148
Welcome back, Niagara.

1060
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,526
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey! Back up!

1062
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,612
Draw more attention
to yourself, why don't you?

1063
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,365
Lay another hand on me,
I'll rip your fucking head off!

1065
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,283
Who's going to fix
your daddy then, huh, moron?

1066
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,787
That's enough. So, do you have
a choice, Jeanie?

1067
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,622
Because without me,

1068
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,000
you're gonna have to answer
to Captain Try Hard, and...

1070
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,712
...sons don't always do
what they're told.

1071
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,385
Fine. But he's not coming in here.

1072
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,386
That's all there is to it.

1073
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,221
You fucking own this place, Dad.

1074
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,557
But she runs it, kiddo.

1075
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,477
- That was the deal.
- Look, Dad...

1077
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,523
...I know that I'm the youngest
and maybe I never...

1078
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,109
...really earned your respect...

1079
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,945
...but if you don't make it,

1080
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,530
I need you to know
that I'll always remember...

1081
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,366
...the thing you told me
the day I turned 16.

1082
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,995
You said go confidently
in the direction of your dreams.

1083
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,539
But my only dream...

1084
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,627
...has ever been
to be more like you.

1085
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,674
I'm sorry, Cros,

1086
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:17,759
because it's...

1087
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,222
...bullshit like that that
made you grow up so fucking soft.

1088
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,391
However,

1089
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,561
if I don't make it out of here,

1090
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,979
this is for you.

1091
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,023
- All right...
- Tickety-tock.

1092
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,107
...family time's over.

1093
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,359
Come on. Take this, apply pressure.

1095
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,612
If the time comes,

1096
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,782
I hope you know
what the fuck to do with that.

1098
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,871
Code Blue.

1099
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,497
"Code Blue"?

1100
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,751
Fuck is a Code Blue?

1101
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,919
Blue like a cop, maybe?

1102
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,546
Yeah, I know!

1103
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,548
Just never had a cop in here before.

1104
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,008
Wasn't talking to you anyway.

1106
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,386
Get you juiced up.

1107
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,930
- Sydolan. A little amp.
- No, no, no!

1108
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,600
You're good to go.
Get you out of here.

1109
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,977
You know, I get blood-tested
as part of my job.

1110
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:09,936
Not my problem.

1111
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,897
Don't know why she let you
in here anyway.

1112
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,482
Because I knew her kid.

1113
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,486
You know he died, right? OD'd.

1114
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,363
That's why she started drinking...

1115
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,198
- ...lost her medical license.
- Nope.

1116
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,699
She didn't tell you about that?

1117
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,118
I don't know. I don't want
to fucking know.

1118
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,912
We've got rules here, lady.

1119
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,498
How I got here, how you got here.
The Nurse, too.

1120
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,125
The rules keep the outside world
fucking outside,

1121
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,043
where they belong.

1122
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,503
All right, dude.

1123
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,047
So, tell me, <i>chota</i>...

1124
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,801
- ...can you keep our secret?
- Of course.

1125
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,511
'Cause you see this badge?

1126
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,096
That means I'm
a healthcare professional.

1127
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,263
- Okay.
- But that knowledge goes...

1128
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,932
Hey, hey! Save me the speech.

1129
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,936
I would not do that. Not to her.

1130
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,233
Good answer. Checkout time.

1134
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,418
Connect secure line. Detroit client.

1136

<i>Motor City Waste Disposal.</i>

1138
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,136
It was a pain in the ass,
but the trap worked.

1139
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,638
The target is now prepped
for an eye-contact kill.

1140
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,890
I'm in position to finish the job,

1141
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,393
but I need a 30% raise
for inconvenience...

1142
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:34,020
...and because
you're fucking gross. Send.

1143
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,030
<i>Please hold for confirmation.</i>

1146
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,338
Fuck.

1148
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,102
- Just keep your eyes down.
- Yeah.

1149
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,363
Busy night in the Artemis.
What room is she in?

1150
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,325
I forgot.

1151
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,244
Like you said,
busy night in the Artemis.

1152
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,040
Nice boots.

1153
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,710
I assume you know to avoid
the beach boys in the lobby, then?

1154
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,171
'Cause they'll kill every one of us
if they find her in here,

1155
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,714
and that includes the old lady.

1156
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,217
Look, Mr. Waikiki,

1157
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,261
that's some membership-revoking
talk right there.

1158
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,098
Sure. But who'd want to be a member
of a secret hospital...

1159
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,184
...for criminals
if it started letting cops in?

1160
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:56,811
Fuck.

1162
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,943
Devil's in the details, big man.

1163
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:17,624
Here we go.

1165
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,466
<i>Extension of terms confirmed.</i>

1166
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,384

1167
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,512
Disconnect.

1171
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:48,405
Poor Jean. This place still
sucking your blood, huh?

1172
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,574
<i>Administering anesthetic.</i>

1173
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,450
Only thing that keeps it ticking.

1174
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,954
Honestly, you got a sea
of galoofs out there.

1175
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,539
How'd you let something
like this happen?

1176
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,000
You know, a pretty girl...

1177
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:06,756
...a purse full of Semtex
and an old man's vanity.

1178
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,258
I hear ya.

1179
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,137
Except the last time somebody
flirted with me, it was 1986.

1180
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,682
How is that son of a bitch
ex-husband?

1181
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,517
<i>Shrapnel identified.</i>

1182

Who knows? Who cares?

1183
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,188
You know, been two wives since me.

1184
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,357
Two. Both nurses.

1185
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,030
What a fucking Clyde.

1186
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,404
You want me to take him out?

1187
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,950
Nah. He lives in Florida.
Life took him out already.

1189
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,830
Hey, you remember when you started
that free clinic?

1191
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:43,585
Den mother to a bunch
of runaways and junkies.

1192
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,796
Look at you now. Legendary.

1193
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,550
Ten milligrams of Benzytrix
and everyone's a storyteller.

1194
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,928
You know, asking you
to set this place up,

1195
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,598
that was... that was one
of my finer ideas.

1196
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,268
Best investment I ever made.

1197
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,853
But...

1198
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,439
But do you regret
that deal with the devil?

1199
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:06,858
You're not the devil, Orian.

1200
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,363
You're just another
ex-hippie con-man,

1201
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,198
swapped his beads for bullets.

1202
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,449
Oh, that's harsh.

1203
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,160
<i>Patient sedation in ten seconds.</i>

1204
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,829
Yeah, it's a trip, Jean.

1205
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,834
I don't regret
the deaths these days.

1207
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,923
Just the lies.

1208
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,134
That one I told you.

1209
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:40,016

but I don't want you to freak out.

1219
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,305
Fuck.

00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:29,149
Hey. Hey, Lev. Hey, Lev.
Lev. Hey, can you hear me?

1222
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,652
Oh, hey, hey.
It's okay, Sherman, man.

1223
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,905
I only took a little bit
to help me feel better.

1224
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,240
We need to leave right now.

1225
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:40,160
Man, we can't.
Man, it's not green yet.

1226
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,078
Half the Malibu Mob is in the lobby.

1227
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,831

The Wolf king's probably here, too.

<i>3-D model accepted.</i>

1230
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,002
It's the worst-case scenario.

1231
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,336
No. No, no, no.

1232
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,714
Nurse said that you can't move me, man,
'cause I might not make it.

1234
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,008
Man, but we have a chance.
If we stay here, we're dead.

1235
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,093
I can't take that chance, Sherm.

1236
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,220
I can't, man. I'm sorry.
I just... I can't.

1237
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:03,141
I'm not that strong, man.
I'm not you, all right?

1238
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:04,768
Okay?

1239
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,688
That doesn't mean you shouldn't go.

1241
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:21,910
Can you level with me?

1242
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,704
Am I gonna make it out of here?

1243
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,664
I hope so.

1244
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,333

- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Can I talk to her?

1249
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,600
Mrs. Thomas,
I'm sorry about earlier.

1250
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,728
That's okay, you just gotta
keep moving, so...

1251
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,607
Yeah, I just... I need...
I need to say something to you, okay?

1254
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,322
You couldn't...
have changed anything,

1255
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,325
and none of that...

1256
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,952
<i>...was your fault.</i>

1257
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:07,789
You got kids, Mo?

1258
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,334
<i>Yeah, I got two. Yeah.</i>

1259
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,713
Then you know.
It's always your fault.

1260
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,968
<i>Two kids, huh? Wow!</i>

1261
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,636
Yeah.

1262
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,138
You know, we've...

1263
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,474
...we still got your old trampoline.

1265
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,936
<i>It's probably
a safety hazard, actually.</i>

1266
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,522
You two used to love that thing.

1267
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,524
Mo and Beau.

1268
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,571
<i>Yeah. That's how I remember him.</i>

1269
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,032
I wish I could say the same.

1271

<i>Patient regaining consciousness.</i>

1272
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,874
- I gotta go.
- I watched a fly...

1273
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,834
Bye, Mrs. Thomas.

1274
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,717
If it only settled down
onto a chair...

1275
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:03,261
...and felt the draft of the wind,

1276
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,974
it might've had a chance,
gotten itself outside.

1277
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,477
What the fuck am I saying?

1278
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,149
Ten milligrams of Benzytrix,
everyone's a storyteller.

1279
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,193
Thirty milligrams...

1281
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,279
...and you get the truth.

1282
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,865
I never told you his name. Beau.

1283
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,326
I got a question for you, Orian.

1284
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,620
Did you know my son?

1287
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:50,975
<i>Passage in or out

01:02:59,150 --> 01:02:59,984

01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,820
<i>3-D printing complete.</i>

1293
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,993

- Yeah?

1294
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,163
Whatcha gonna do?

1295
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,249
You're my brother.

1296
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,253
I love you.

1297
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,925
What choice do I have?

1298
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:29,639
So, what? So, wait,
you got like a plan?

1300
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,434
Had a whole bunch of plans, Lev.

1301
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,186
My whole life.

1302
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:39,023
And really, they were all about you.

1303
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,735
But you just kept fucking them up.

1304
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:49,909
So now we sit and we wait,

1305
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,912
and we hope nobody finds us,
'cause if they do,

1306
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,539
then, no, man, I don't have a plan.

1307
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,125
But, uh, I got the next best thing.

1308
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,295
I got a gun.

1309
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,677
<i>Benzytrix level toxic.</i>

1310
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:12,348
I said, did you know my son?

1312
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,523
I didn't really know him, but...

1313
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:25,194
...I had this white 911.

1314
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,239
One of the originals
with air-cooled turbo...

1315
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,449
Hey! Hey!

1316
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,325
Did you know my son?

1318
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,167
Yeah. He stole my car.

1319
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,335
You know the rules.

1320
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,046
You take something
from me, I gotta...

1321
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,631
...give you back to the ocean.

1322
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,972
The police report. They said he OD'd.

1323
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,516
I own the police, Jean.

1324
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,726
No! No!

1325
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,436
It all came full circle!

1326
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,189
'Cause that's how I found you.

1327
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,485
This poor woman,
grieving for her son.

1328
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,820
So fucking drunk
she wasn't even allowed...

1329
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,323
...to fix her waifs
and strays anymore.

1330
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,701
I gave you a way
to help people again.

1331
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:16,621

1332

and the Artemis was born.

1333
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,418
You killed Beau!

1334
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,130
You killed my son!

1335
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,841
You made a deal with the devil.

1336
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,635
What'd you expect?

1340
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,916

Is that you, Jean? Hey!

1372

Okay, wait. Listen, listen.

I could make that Detroit money
look like a bad tip...

1377

Don't give them
your dignity for free.

1379

Wait, Nice is in there with him?

1395
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,699
He's flatlining!

1397
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:29,040
Of course. She only kills
important people.

Okay.

Okay.

1415

If you truly believe
you lost him because of me...

1418
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,787
Told him not to touch
my jacket, fucker!

1421
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,960

but now I gotta fucking shoot you!

1434

01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,469
<i>I'm gonna burn this fucking
place to the ground!</i>

1467
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:11,845
Go that way!

1468
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,556
- Get the patients out!
- Hey, come on!

1469
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,768
- They're coming through.
- I'm staying.

1470
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,396
- I'm gonna stop them.
- No, no. Look.

1471
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,608
You're a tiny old lady.
You ain't stopping shit.

1473
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:28,988
Hurry up!

1474
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:30,948
You always help everyone.

1475
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:34,201
Let me help you. Please.

1476
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,210
Take good care of her, okay?

1477
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,716
- Yes, Nurse.
- Good boy.

1479
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,397
Please, tell him I did this.

1480
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,190
Wait, aren't you coming with us?

1481
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,526
You fix people. I break them.

1482
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:12,031
We can't pick what we're good at...

1483
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,449
...or who we love.

1485
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:23,042
Where is it? Goddamn wind space!

1486
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,879
All right! That's it! Feel that?

1488
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,258
Where's... Where is she?

1489
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,178
Nice stayed behind. Yeah...

1490
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:37,306
...she's trying to say
she's sorry... her way.

1492
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,237
<i>Get us through there now!</i>

1493
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:56,533
<i>- Put your backs into it!
- Hurry the fuck up!</i>

1495
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,980
<i>Apparently, you guys
don't know the rules.</i>

1496
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:07,836
Visiting hours are never!

1497
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:10,881
What's going on? Where's my father?

1498
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,634
You can't save everyone.

1499
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,347
No!

1500
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,684
Don't... cross... my line!

1507
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:55,843
In hospitals, we use codes.

1508
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:59,763
A slow code, that's when
a patient's already dead.

1509
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,641
But, you know,
we gotta make a show of it.

1510
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,643
Ease the family into the idea.

1511
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:06,311
Why are you telling me?

1512
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,733
Because, Junior...
you're a slow code.

1513
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,110
See, your homies here,
they don't know it yet,

1514
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,529
but you're dead.

1524
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,562
I'm coming for you, slow code!

1530
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,762
Oh, what the fuck happened tonight?

1531
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,223
Well, people broke the rules:

1532
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,266
No guns, no guests, no bombs,

1533
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,519
no insulting staff,
no killing the other patients...

1534
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,937
And no cops?

1535
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,397
I met your friend.

1536
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,610
She's not my friend.
She knew my son.

1537
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:42,241
- I didn't know you had a kid.
- Yeah, I used to.

1538
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,451
Eighteen-wheeler story.

1543
01:17:58,632 --> 01:17:59,466
<i>Come on!</i>

1545
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,061
I already told you...

1547
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,025
...don't cross my fucking line!

1548
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,950
Let's get you out of here!
Come on! Up!

1550
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,078
The whole riot's here now.

1552
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,499
Put your weight on me.
That's right.

1553
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,293
Which door we leaving out of?

1554
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,253
They sealed all the doors
and the tunnels...

1555
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:37,963
...but there's one they missed.

1556
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,091
- Is this the front?
- That's right.

1557
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:42,718
You're going out...

1558
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:44,261
...the way nobody uses anymore.

1559
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,680
The way I walked in 22 years ago.

1560
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:48,015
Wait, hold on. Back up.

1561
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:50,100
What do you mean... I'm going?

1562
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,101
You!

1563
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,021
You let him die.

1564
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:58,567
He made me bring him here
and you fucking let him die.

1565
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,069
Okay, just wait, wait!
Something you need to see.

1566
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,489
- Right here, huh?
- Who the fuck are you?

1567
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,575
I'm the guy who stole your diamonds.

1568
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:09,369
Now, Daddy's dead, okay?

1569
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,121
Your mob's gonna need a new boss.

1570
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:12,331
Somebody special.

1571
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,540
Somebody who's got...

1572
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:15,667
...what all your daddy's
other kids don't.

1573
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,921
Six Yakutia Canaries.

1574
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,380
Right?

1575
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,760
Okay, I'll take
that deal. You can go.

1576
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:26,178
Okay.

1577
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,300
No, you! You can go,
she fucking stays!

1578
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:33,435
Go on. Go on, get out. Get out.

1579
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,812
Come on, come on, come on.

1581
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,300
Oh, hey! Get his eyes!

1586
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,475
Whoa, what was that?

1587
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,812
I told you...
baby fucking elephants!

1588
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:20,565
His men!

1589
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:24,270
There may be more of them coming.
We need to get out of here.

1591
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:27,739
- I can't. I can't do it. No.
- We can do it together.

1592
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,784
Okay. Come on. Come on. Take this.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

1594
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:37,457
You got keys?

1595
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,926
- You okay?
- I don't know.

1596
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:51,680
Hey, getting out is always
tougher than getting in.

1597
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,598
Believe me... I know.

1598
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:56,727
There you go.

1601
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:31,178
Okay.

1602
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,234
We gotta go!

1603
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:59,910
Free the water! Free the water! Free the water! 

1606
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,019
Car's right around this bus.

1607
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,248
There it is. We're gonna make it.

1609
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,751
All right. One second.

1611
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:52,968
We're good to go!

1613
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:58,473
You know what?

1614
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:05,313
It looks like it's...
it's gonna be a nice morning.

1615
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:07,524
I think I'm just gonna take a walk.

1616
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:09,359
No, hey. Hey.

1617
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,154
Tell me you're not going back inside.

1618
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:15,991
The Artemis? Nah, we're done.

1619
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,787
But, uh, you know...

1620
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,374
...if I leave town, who...

1621
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,751
...who's gonna fix
all these people? Huh?

1622
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,212
- Just get in the car, come on.
- Nah, I'm old.

1623
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,300
Helping people's
all I know how to do.

1624
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,135
I'm good with that.

1625
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,346
Which reminds me...

1626
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:42,809
...that last bullet that missed
your mesenteric artery...

1627
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:44,936
...still gotta get that
cleaned and stitched.

1628
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:49,024
There's a dark room in Vegas.

1629
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,358
It's called The Apache.

1630
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:53,778
Heading out that way? Huh?

1631
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:58,116
Honestly, I don't know
where I'm going next.

1632
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:02,204
First time in my life
I can do whatever I want.

1633
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,081
Never planned for that.

1634
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,001
You'll figure it out.

1635
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,340
Getting out's always tougher
than getting in.

1636
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,012
Go on.

1640
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,231
Keep it Christmas-y, babe.
