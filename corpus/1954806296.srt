1
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,532
Woman: <i>Jeremy, you
haven't showered yet?</i>

2
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:04,432
<i>Elizabeth, hurry up.</i>
<i>I'm leaving in 10 minutes.</i>

3
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,466
<i>And, Jeremy,</i>
<i>your room is a mess.</i>

4
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,266
- <i> I want it cleaned by tonight.</i>
- Jeremy:<i> Yes, ma'am.</i>

5
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,299
<i>That goes for you too,</i>
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

6
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,366
Elizabeth: <i>Mom, have you seen
my red New York t-shirt?</i>

7
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,132
<i>Look in the laundry basket</i>
<i>in my bedroom.</i>

8
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,067
<i>Wake up, Harry.</i>
<i>No more warnings.</i>

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,032
Wake up, lazybones. I have
to leave in 10 minutes, now.

10
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,899
Hurry up.

11
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,366
You know, Harry, you can't stay
up every night being scared

12
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,366
and then sleep in
every morning.

13
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,732
And please pick up this room.

14
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,866
I can't stand it any longer.

15
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:37,900
I mean it, Harry,
or no summer camp.

16
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,767
Mom, it's not here.

17
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,433
<i>I've nothing to wear.</i>
<i>She never takes me shopping.</i>

18
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:01,399
Love the do, Harry. Mom, will you
buy me a tent for my birthday?

19
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,866
I don't want cereal.
I want pancakes.

20
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:07,366
Harry, brush your hair. Talk
to me when I'm richer, Jeremy.

21
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,732
<i>Oh, and, guys, we have to
do the garden this weekend.</i>

22
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,199
- Mom, sign my report card yet?
- Mom, please, oh, please,

23
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,332
oh, please, will you
take me to the circus?

24
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,866
Where'd you put it, Jeremy?

25
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,799
I don't know, mom.
I gave it to you.

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,332
- Please?
- We'll see, Harry.

27
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,099
I hate cereal.
Ricky Turner's mom

28
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,099
always makes him pancakes and
eggs and bacon for breakfast.

29
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,199
<i>Well, Ricky Turner's mother
doesn't have to work.</i>

30
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,399
<i>Now stop whining,</i>
<i>and start eating,</i>

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,032
and, Harry, you promised you'd
clean the rotten eyeball's bowl.

32
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:34,432
Do it today, or let's
take him back to the pond.

33
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,799
Mom, I can't find
my red New York t-shirt.

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,399
Oh, and by the way, I'm going to
the mall after school with Erin.

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,766
- No, you're not.
- Oh, mom, please? Everyone does it.

36
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,466
Honey, you are
only 12 years old.

37
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:47,299
Get real, mom. I'm going
to be in eighth grade.

38
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,432
Oh, well, aren't you
just too cool for words?

39
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,432
Grow up. You're just
jealous 'cause I'm older.

40
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,866
- Blehh.
- Eww, gross, Jeremy.

41
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,333
Mom, I'm joining the
circus when I grow up.

42
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,899
- Harry!
- Mom:<i> Aww, Harry.</i>

43
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,832
<i>Look what you've done.</i>

44
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,432
Mom, don't tell me my shirt's

45
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,399
<i>still in the dirty laundry.</i>
<i>What am I gonna wear?</i>

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,766
Well, Elizabeth, you're
almost in the eighth grade.

47
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,800
You ought to be capable of
doing your own laundry.

48
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,699
<i>Ah, I am already</i>
<i>15 minutes late.</i>

49
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,266
<i>Now, guys, I love you to bits,</i>

50
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,432
but I'm sick and tired of this.

51
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:22,266
If I come home tonight and
this house is not clean,

52
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:25,799
nobody is going out this
weekend, and I mean it.

53
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,732
Elizabeth: <i>Come on. We better go.
It's 20 after.</i>

54
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,466
What's her problem?

55
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:33,232
Sometimes I think we have the
worst mother in the world.

56
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,266
Don't you wish we had
one of those mothers

57
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,833
who did everything for you?

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,866

70
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,800
Was your cookie.

71
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:13,199
Got anything else good?

72
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,333
Hey, Martin, looks like your brother's
getting his butt kicked again.

73
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,299
Maybe next time, Turner...

74
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,699
hey, hey, hey!
What's going on here, boys?

75
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,466
He pushed me for no reason.

76
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:33,466
That's not true. He pushed
my brother down first.

77
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:36,399
Now you're the older boy here.
Violence is no way to solve anything.

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,066
Come on. Ricky, this
isn't your fault.

79
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,066
Look what I got
from my mom's closet.

80
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,133
Girl ♪2: <i>All right,
let me have one.</i>

81
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:47,000
Elizabeth Martin.

82
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:51,699
Hello. Mrs. Martin, please.

83
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,766
Mrs. Martin? Hi. This is Terrance
leeby, school principal.

84
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,099
<i>Yes, I'm sorry to bother you,</i>

85
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,433
<i>but I'm afraid I need to make an
appointment for a home visit.</i>

86
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:07,166
Yes, I know summer
vacation starts tomorrow,

87
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,899
but this is very important.

88
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,232
Men don't cry. I mean,
really, what would dad say?

89
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,066
You gotta be strong,
Harry, take charge.

90
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:18,232
What am I supposed to do if
a bigger kid picks on me?

91
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,466
Well, whatever it takes.
Just don't be a wimp.

92
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,999
Look, if you have to,
punch him in the nose.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,932
Harry, ignore Mr. Macho here.

94
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:27,032
We've got much bigger
problems than that.

95
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,132
Jeremy: Yeah, like
mom's gonna kill us.

96
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,999
Harry: Maybe Ms. Cavour
can do some flower magic

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,332
and make leeby go up in smoke.

98
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,266
Elizabeth: You're such a kid.

99
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,232
Mrs. Cavour doesn't
do real magic.

100
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:38,999
She just talks to her flowers.

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,332
Harry: But her flowers grow
better than anybody else's.

102
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,799
Jeremy: Yeah, which means she's
got a lot more rose bugs

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,867
for us to catch and earn money.

104
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,232
- Jeremy: <i>There she is over there.</i>
- Harry:<i> I see her.</i>

105
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,767
- Jeremy:<i> Mrs. Cavour.</i>
- Harry:<i> Come on.</i>

106
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:35,199
Hello, Mrs. Cavour. Were you
putting a spell on the rose bugs?

107
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,266
Hello, children.

108
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,466
No, I couldn't do that.

109
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,466
That would be
like spraying them.

110
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,932
There's no joy
in an unequal battle.

111
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:48,132
I bet you have come
for your wages, haven't you?

112
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,699
Yeah, well, summer
vacation starts tomorrow,

113
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,399
and we could sure use it.

114
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,232
Especially since we're gonna be
in the doghouse with our mother.

115
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:58,032
Well, if you're interested in more
work, you can see I need the help.

116
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:01,866
Can't you just do some magic
to make the bugs disappear?

117
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,799
- Harry, stop it.
- Why? I think it'd be really cool.

118
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,799
Just kind of zap them,
and presto, they're history.

119
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,999
Jeremy: No, I'll tell you
what'd be really cool.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,899
If we just kind of zap mom,
and presto, she's history.

121
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,866
Elizabeth: Yeah, I
could get into that.

122
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,866
Get rid of mom before
she grounds us.

123
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:20,932
For real, Ms. Cavour, is
there any kind of spell

124
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,832
<i>that can make bugs or anything,
even people disappear?</i>

125
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,299
Well, the ancients believed that
the stars were our memories

126
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,166
and one removed an enemy by erasing
all memory of that person,

127
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,732
all belongings, all reminders.

128
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,932
Wait a minute. So we could
just kind of forget

129
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,466
everything about mom, including
her nagging and cleaning up?

130
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:42,899
Precisely.

131
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,932
Wow. Wouldn't that be cool?

132
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,032
Yeah, and imagine if
we even got a perfect mom

133
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,999
who never, ever punished us.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,366
Jeremy: The ancients say anything
about how to make it work?

135
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,266
Elizabeth: Sure, dork-head.
"Abracadabra."

136
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:57,266
No, erasing memory
is a very dangerous game.

137
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:59,732
It's not one I would
play with, my dears.

138
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,199
That's easy for you to say. You
don't live with our mother.

139
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,799
Well, I believe
the ancients used to say,

140
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,832
<i>"abit luna, abit Stella."</i>

141
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,466
<i>Roughly translated, that means,
"moon gone, stars gone,"</i>

142
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,866
<i>and then they'd say</i>
<i>whatever they wanted gone.</i>

143
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,732
For example,
in your case, you'd say,

144
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,899
<i>"abit matera,"</i> "mother gone."

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,132
<i>And if it worked... and that's
assuming a great deal...</i>

146
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,399
your mother would be gone,

147
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,867
and then you could go to the mommy
market and pick out a new mother.

148
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,232
You could go where?

149
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,299
The mommy market.

150
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,732
Jeremy, don't get any ideas.
She's pulling our leg.

151
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:40,899
Come on, we better get home
and prepare for battle.

152
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,332
- Elizabeth: See you, Ms. Cavour.
- Harry: Bye bye, Mrs. Cavour.

153
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,266
Harry: <i>Do you think mom's
gonna take away TV?</i>

154
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:48,132
Jeremy: <i>She's gonna nail us.</i>

155
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,032
Yeah, I don't feel like
facing her right now.

156
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,900
Jeremy: <i>What a pain.</i>

157
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,932
Mom: <i>Who do you think you are?</i>

158
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,866
You can't just go around
doing whatever you want.

159
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:06,232
<i>And, Elizabeth,</i>
<i>cigarettes, really.</i>

160
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,232
<i>Well, that's it.</i>

161
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:12,099
<i>You're all grounded,</i>
<i>period, understand?</i>

162
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,832
<i>There's no camp, no allowance,</i>

163
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,932
<i>no TV, no nothing.</i>

164
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,099
Now up to your room
right now, this instant.

165
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,166
- I am furious.
- But, mom...

166
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:25,166
don't "but, mom" me. Things are gonna
change around here permanently.

167
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,966
Now march.

168
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:29,232
Harry, I thought I told you

169
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:32,066
to keep your stuff
in your room.

170
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:35,332
I'm going to camp.
I don't care what she says.

171
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,166
Camp I can do without,
but being around her

172
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:38,699
for the whole summer,
forget it.

173
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,366
<i>I'm out of here.</i>

174
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,299
Yeah. No wonder dad left her.

175
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,200
Wish we didn't have
to be stuck with her.

176
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,033
- Hey. Hey, that's it.
- What?

177
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:59,699
Maybe we could try to make her
disappear, like Mrs. Cavour said.

178
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,332
- Please.
- No, really. Come on.

179
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,699
Everyone sit in a circle.
We gotta make it look SWAT.

180
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,432
But then she'll be gone.

181
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,866
Duh, but then we get
to go to that mommy market

182
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:13,832
<i>and pick out a new mother,</i>
<i>a perfect mother.</i>

183
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,832
Harry...

184
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,099
A mother that makes
pancakes every morning.

185
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,166
- Wow!
- You guys are brain-damaged.

186
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,332
Could you stop being
such a drip, Elizabeth?

187
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,332
You want to watch TV, see
your friends, go to the mall?

188
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,699
Yeah, if it works, we'll get
to do anything we want.

189
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,466
And when it doesn't work,
Mr. Magic?

190
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:36,332
Ooh, then I'll tell all your cool
friends you look like a jerk.

191
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,766
What do you care? If it doesn't
work, it doesn't work. Big deal.

192
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,166
Oh, Elizabeth,
stop being such a yuppie.

193
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,999
A what?

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,133
Jeremy: <i>Come on.
Everybody hold hands.</i>

195
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,366
Okay, how'd it go?

196
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,732
We gotta all say it together.

197
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:57,699
Harry: Uh,<i> abit </i>something...

198
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,099
oh, yeah. <i>Abit luna,</i>

199
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,933
<i>abit Stella, abit matera.</i>

200
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,999
Okay, everybody together.

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,799
<i>Abit luna,</i>

202
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,132
<i>abit Stella,</i>

203
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,467
<i>abit matera.</i>

204
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,032
Mom: <i>Okay, kids, five
minutes to bedtime.</i>

205
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,066
<i>I don't want to have to</i>
<i>come up there.</i>

206
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,066
So much for that bright idea.

207
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,766
Any more hocus-pocus
you guys want to whip up?

208
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,333
Looks like there's
a storm coming.

209
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,366
We better get to bed

210
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,700
before mom grounds us
for the century.

211
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:31,466
Harry: <i>What... what's happening?</i>

212
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:36,300
I... I feel confused.

213
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,467
Elizabeth: <i>It's all empty.</i>

214
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:47,932
What used to be in here?

215
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:51,933
I don't know. I can't remember.

216
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,767
What's going on?
Whose room is this?

217
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,899
The magic. We did the magic.

218
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,066
Elizabeth: <i>Right, but
can you remember her?</i>

219
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,432
Well, sure.

220
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,433
I mean, she, um...

221
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,699
We wanted to get rid of her.

222
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,966
Get rid of who?
What does she look like?

223
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:20,966
How did she talk?

224
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:24,333
I... I don't know.

225
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,867
I don't remember.

226
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,933
Do you guys?

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,767
Are you guys scared?

228
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,433
No.

229
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,066
Jeremy: <i>No, we're not scared.</i>

230
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,466
I mean, this is what we wanted.

231
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,266
<i>We erased her. We're free.</i>

232
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:55,899
<i>We can do whatever we want.</i>

233
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,366
We can get a new mother, right?

234
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,999
Right. A perfect mother.

235
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,532
Harry: Yippee!

236
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,066
<i>♪ Whoa, I feel good ♪</i>

237
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,799

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,266

I believe this is yours.

257
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,332
Is your mother home?

258
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,199
- No, she's not.
- <i> Really?</i>

259
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,999
We had an appointment.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,832
Well, she had an emergency.

261
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,832
She had to leave very quickly.
I'm so sorry.

262
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,699
When do you expect her?

263
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,332
We don't. We got rid of her.

264
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,332
Tonight. We're
expecting her tonight.

265
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,132
We'll tell her you dropped by.

266
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,466
Okay. Thanks.

267
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:37,000
Have her call me tomorrow, will you?
It's important.

268
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,866
Elizabeth: <i>Mrs. Cavour!</i>

269
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:47,166
Mrs. Cavour, we need to
find the mommy market.

270
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:50,266
Yeah, we got rid of
our mother. She's gone.

271
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:53,699
Gone? I don't understand.

272
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,199
Where has your mother gone to?

273
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,099
We erased her like you
told us the ancients did,

274
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,466
and now we can't
remember her at all.

275
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,566
Oh, I see.

276
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,966
Yeah, and we can't cook very
well, and we need dinner.

277
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,932
Besides, we want a new
mother, not no mother.

278
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:10,400
Yeah, so where's the mommy market?
How do we get there?

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,432
Lily, germander, sops in wine,

280
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:18,867
sweetbrier, bonfire, columbine.

281
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:24,366
It's many years since I've
been to the mommy market.

282
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,432
I don't know if it's
still in operation,

283
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:30,432
but it used to be all the way
downtown in the old district

284
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:33,732
just beyond central square.

285
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,899
I can't imagine
that it's moved,

286
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,932
but it's only open for business

287
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,433
on Sundays from 3:00 to 5:00.

288
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,432
Mrs. Cavour:
<i>Go down main street</i>

289
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,367
<i>till you come</i>
<i>to the open-air market.</i>

290
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,832
<i>Keep the clock tower</i>
<i>on your left,</i>

291
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,166
<i>and move west from it</i>
<i>along the market.</i>

292
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,066
<i>Halfway down the block</i>

293
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,499
<i>is a small cobblestone street.</i>

294
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,432
Elizabeth: There's the
cobblestone street.

295
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,866
Mrs. Cavour: <i>Take that right.
Continue on</i>

296
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,132
<i>until you come</i>
<i>to a small alley.</i>

297
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:14,432
- <i> Childers Lane, it was called.</i>
- Jeremy: Look, it's there!

298
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:17,099
- Elizabeth: "Childers Lane."
- <i> Follow that to its end,</i>

299
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,866
<i>and there you will find</i>
<i>the mommy market,</i>

300
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,900
<i>if you find it at all.</i>

301
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,232
Thank you. Please
deposit your token.

302
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,167
Thank you.

303
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,832
Whoo!

304
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,732
Look... twin mothers!

305
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,732
Woman: <i>I know everything
there is to know</i>

306
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,700
<i>about any...</i>

307
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,732
Boy: <i>Remember, you guys,
this is our last token.</i>

308
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:32,199
You haven't tasted anything till
you taste my butter chip cookies.

309
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,866
Hi.

310
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:36,332
Boy: Can you bake a
chocolate cake too?

311
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,432
- Of course I can, honey.
- With thick frosting?

312
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,966
- Naturally, sweetie pie.
- Girl: Do you get mad

313
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,999
if the children pick the
frosting and leave the cake?

314
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,432
Woman: <i>Why, sugar
bun, what you want</i>

315
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,366
is a big plate
of chocolate fudge instead.

316
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,132
- Boy:<i> Yeah.</i>
- I want her.

317
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,932
Well, wait till
we've seen them all.

318
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,932
Girl ♪2: What kind of
cakes do you bake?

319
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:56,932
- Yeah.
- Youth: What can I do for you?

320
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:58,799
We'd like to get
one of these mothers.

321
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,332
Okay. What's your name?

322
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,132
Elizabeth, Jeremy
and Harry Martin.

323
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,166
I'm Edward. Welcome
to the mommy market,

324
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,132
established in 1742.

325
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,899
You mean the mommy market's
been here that long?

326
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,899
<i>Well, not the way it is now.</i>

327
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,966
It used to be called "parental
exchange, female division."

328
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,966
Is there a daddy market?
Can we go there too?

329
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,766
Edward: You can
go there instead,

330
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,432
but no one can go
to both at once.

331
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,332
It's always disastrous.

332
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,332
We better get a mother first.

333
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,332
We want someone
who can cook pancakes.

334
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,399
Well, we've got 'em all here.

335
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,166
However, before you choose
a mother, we have one rule

336
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,332
to which there's
absolutely no exception.

337
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:35,066
All families have three picks.

338
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,132
Woman: <i>I mean, I'm the most
fun mom in this whole world.</i>

339
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,432
We give each family
three of these tokens.

340
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,999
You have to deposit
one of these tokens

341
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,432
into that metal
turnstile over there

342
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,432
before security will let
you take a mother home.

343
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:49,732
We found that if children don't
find a suitable new mother

344
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,699
by the third try,
they never will.

345
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,899
So here are your tokens,

346
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,933
and good luck.

347
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:02,866
"Ad matrem per espera."

348
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:04,466
What does that mean?

349
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:09,732
365 gifts a year.

350
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,800
Yes.

351
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,199
Woman: <i>And we'll put all
these gifts in the car,</i>

352
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,999
and we'll take my cake.
Who wants to taste my cake?

353
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,699
Kids: Me! Me!

354
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,732
Woman: You like that, don't you?

355
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,999
Child: All of my favorite flavors.
Oh, chocolate.

356
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,799
Woman ♪2: <i>Creativity, that's
the most important thing.</i>

357
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,799
Aerialist: May I have
your attention, please?

358
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,066
<i>Step, step right up!</i>

359
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:39,199
<i>Greatest show in the world!</i>

360
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,999
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

361
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,299
Hey, kids! Whoo!

362
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,466
Come on, Harry.

363
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:49,432
- <i> Whoo! Whoo!</i>
- No, I don't.

364
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,333
Puppet: No, I don't. Let me go.

365
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,032
♪ He does nothing at all ♪

366
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:22,767
♪ He's just
a rock-and-roll boy... ♪

367
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,200
Policewoman: Come on.

368
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,432
Now there's a mother
who can teach you

369
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,299
how to take care
of yourself, Harry.

370
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,466
Don't even think it.
She's taken.

371
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:41,100
Ah.

372
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,333
Woman:<i> Yeah.</i>

373
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:53,266
- Are you serious?
- She's terribly beautiful.

374
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,799
Oh, I don't believe this.

375
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,032
Do you really like children?

376
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:59,866
Of course I do, darling.

377
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,766
What do you do with them?

378
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:05,099
<i>Oh, with a girl your age,</i>
<i>I would have such fun.</i>

379
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,066
I would teach you how to dress
to your best advantage.

380
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,832
<i>Ohh.</i>

381
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,232
We would have to do
something about your hair.

382
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:16,332
<i>You're getting much</i>
<i>too old for that hairdo.</i>

383
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:20,299
I'm sure Hank my hairdresser
could do wonders for you.

384
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,932
- He could?
- Come on, Elizabeth.

385
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,267
- Let's go to the next one.
- Can you cook?

386
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,366
Of course not, darling.

387
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,766
<i>But I never go anywhere</i>
<i>without my chef Pierre.</i>

388
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:36,699
Ohh, mwah. A true artiste.

389
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,766
Pierre can do anything.

390
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,733
Elizabeth, no.

391
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,399
Wait a minute.

392
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,399
I like her the best so far.

393
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,266
Are you kidding? Look at her.
She looks like Cruella de vil.

394
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:55,766
I hate her.
She smokes cigarettes.

395
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,966
I want the cookie one.

396
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:01,099
Edward on p.A.: <i>Five minutes to closing.
Five minutes to closing.</i>

397
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,166
- Look, I'm the oldest.
- I'm the biggest.

398
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:06,132
Either we take her, or we wait till next week.
What'll it be, boys?

399
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,899
Woman: And they lived
happily ever after.

400
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,899
She does have a cook.

401
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,032
Bet you he can make
pancakes for breakfast.

402
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:16,199
She's obviously rich, Jeremy.

403
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,732
<i>She could buy you anything.</i>

404
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:21,766
- Storyteller: Did you like my stories?
- Kids:<i> Yeah!</i>

405
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:24,166
- <i> Will you come home with us?</i>
- Storyteller: Oh, I'd love to.

406
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,967
Okay.

407
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,766
Um, excuse me.

408
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:33,099
Would you like
to be our mother?

409
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,867
Oh, that would
be divine, darling.

410
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:42,233
Call me mama.

411
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:48,132
Ah, there, chivas.

412
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,999
Wow. You mean we
get to ride in this?

413
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,732
Ah, surely you did not
expect us to take the bus.

414
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:57,866
Harry: This is
the biggest car ever!

415
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,699
Say, give me five.

416
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,000
Oh, yeah. Cruising
down the Avenue.

417
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,833
Jeremy: Oh, we are so rich.

418
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,999
Oh, do you have
any grey poupon?

419
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,999
He's always wanted
to say that, yeah.

420
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,067
- Ha ha.
- Yeah. Whoo!

421
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:34,199
I suppose this whole space
might do as my closet.

422
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I'll take that one over there.

423
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,332
<i>It's crooked.</i>

424
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,300
<i>Thank you.</i>

425
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:50,267
Now do show me the house,
darlings.

426
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,466
Ta-da!

427
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,899
Nobody smokes
in our room, mama.

428
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,899
Here. Put it out.

429
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,767
- He's kidding.
- Ohh.

430
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:05,866
A real little boy's room.

431
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:08,032
<i>Mon dieu!</i>

432
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:12,899
What is that terrible,
nasty-looking creature?

433
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,466
<i>It's not real...</i>

434
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:16,766
- <i> What? Where?</i>
- ...ls it?

435
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:20,066
- I think she means Michael.
- That's Michael, my iguana.

436
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:22,266
No! No no no no no.

437
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:24,266
Don't take him out.

438
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:28,066
I don't think mama
cares for Michael.

439
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:30,966
Madame: <i>Pierre made
madame's favorite,</i>

440
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,033
<i>poached octopus.</i>

441
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,700
Eww.

442
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:55,732
I'm planning
an intimate little party

443
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:57,733
to introduce you children...

444
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,232
To 90 of my closest friends.

445
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:07,799
But oh, there's so much
work to do.

446
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,200
Where shall we start? Mmm!

447
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:16,900
Harrington, eat. Eat.

448
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Ahem!

449
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:40,432
Madame.

450
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,767
Ucch! Ohh.

451
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:55,000
Bye bye, little fishies.

452
00:27:57,233 --> 00:28:00,232
- Jeremy:<i> Here she comes.</i>
- Harry:<i> Finally.</i>

453
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:03,766
- <i> Come on!</i>
- <i> Hurry up, Elizabeth!</i>

454
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,033
Come on, Elizabeth.
We gotta have a meeting.

455
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,699
What's up?

456
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,699
Hurry up.
We gotta have a meeting.

457
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,066
Hang on, guys.
I think that the treehouse

458
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,266
<i>is, you know,</i>
<i>more for kids your age.</i>

459
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:19,299
Elizabeth, don't try
to grow up right now.

460
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,266
<i>This woman is</i>
<i>seriously bad news.</i>

461
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,266
She flushed Harry's tadpoles
down the toilet.

462
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:25,032
I raised them from eggs.

463
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:27,199
Harry, I'm sure
she didn't know.

464
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,199
All of 'em, even the big fat
one, the rotten eyeball.

465
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,133
That's not all, Elizabeth.

466
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,399
Look what I found in the rag drawer.
Say the password.

467
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,332
- Rose and sword forever.
- <i> Come on.</i>

468
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:45,266
My favorite t-shirt.

469
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,266
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

470
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,266
Harrington! Jeremy!

471
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:51,199
We have an appointment.

472
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,932
Come down at once
from that horrible eyesore.

473
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:59,732
I'm going to have that
thing torn down next week.

474
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,432
Ugh. Disgusting.

475
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:03,367
<i>Bonjour.</i>

476
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:19,732
Watch it.

477
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,732
<i>Pardonnez-moi, monsieur.</i>
I know not.

478
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:23,466
Yeah, okay.

479
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:26,099
Is Mrs. Martin home?

480
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,799
Who? Oh, uh, the madame.

481
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,932
Um, she is out
with the children.

482
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:33,699
Would you like
to leave her a message?

483
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,232
Yeah, you give
the madame a message.

484
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:36,966
<i>Tell her I'm coming by</i>
<i>tomorrow morning</i>

485
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:40,299
and that she'd better be here.

486
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,999
Ooh la la. Heh heh heh.

487
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,366
Madame: <i>Hank, it has to go.</i>

488
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,933
<i>She's much too old</i>
<i>for that hairdo.</i>

489
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:53,199
Oh, I want the length off.

490
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,199
I want something
with sharp angles

491
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,067
and I don't want to discuss it.

492
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:06,932
Hank, don't even
think about it.

493
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:09,866
Ha ha ha ha. Relax, darling.

494
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:12,266
And harrington over there

495
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:14,967
<i>just needs cleaning up.</i>

496
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:19,932
Cavour: <i>What am I going to do
about you morning glories?</i>

497
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:23,399
What'll I do? What'll I do?

498
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,800
You just won't stop, will you?

499
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,166
Hello, Mrs. Cavour.

500
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,766
What's the matter?

501
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:43,899
I'm going to have to take strong
measures against these morning glories.

502
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,832
They... they want the whole
garden to themselves.

503
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:50,367
Tell me, children,
did you find the mommy market?

504
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,266
Children, what have
you done to yourselves?

505
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,466
We found it, all right.

506
00:30:57,467 --> 00:31:00,466
We haven't done anything.
It's all mama.

507
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,132
- Who?
- <i> Mama.</i>

508
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:04,066
Elizabeth picked
a real winner of a mother.

509
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,466
She's a nightmare, and we're
all gonna die of lung cancer.

510
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,366
I said we could wait.

511
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,899
Man, I never want to go shopping
again as long as I live.

512
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,866
<i>She's horrible. She wanted
to tear down our treehouse</i>

513
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,799
<i>we built by ourself.</i>

514
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,832
She's really gross. She
wears a big white fur thing

515
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,866
and smokes cigarettes
all day long.

516
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:22,866
Oh.

517
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:24,866
I see the picture.

518
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:28,799
Well, only experience is going to
help you find the right mother.

519
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,799
But I can see the difficulty
you're having with this one.

520
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,467
My grandfather always
used to tell me...

521
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:41,467
Which means "watch out for
people who like fur coats."

522
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:47,267
<i>It's clear your mama</i>
<i>doesn't like animals.</i>

523
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:49,799
I cannot stay
in this house any longer

524
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,632
with that creature loose in it.

525
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:55,632
I must go back
to the mommy market

526
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,832
and find some other
little children

527
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,732
who don't keep monsters
in their bedrooms.

528
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:04,332
There's some cold octopus
in the refrigerator.

529
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,699
Oh, my darlings,

530
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,066
you will... mwah mwah...
easily find

531
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,266
another mother... mwah mwah...

532
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:13,932
at the market.

533
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:16,999
<i>But for goodness' sakes,</i>
<i>warn her</i>

534
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,666
that's she's coming to a house

535
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,866
with a monster loose in it!

536
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,199
Chivas,<i> vite, vite.</i>

537
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,800
Of course, madame.

538
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
- Chivas!
- Sorry, madame.

539
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,999
Oh, no. Perfect timing.

540
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Wait a minute. Wait.
Just one minute. Wait.

541
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Never mind.

542
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,232
I'll handle this.
Hello, Mr. Leeby.

543
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,966
I hope you didn't have another
appointment with our mother.

544
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,032
I haven't been able
to reach your mother.

545
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:02,399
She doesn't return my calls.

546
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,766
She hasn't shown up at work.

547
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,832
- <i> Now where is she, kids?</i>
- She's out.

548
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,866
- I want the truth.
- She's out.

549
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,866
We'll tell her you dropped by.

550
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:13,032
Well, who was that woman
in the limo?

551
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:15,999
That's our interior decorator.

552
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,099
<i>Um, mom's redoing the house.</i>

553
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,099
I don't know what's
going on around here,

554
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,666
but I do know you're trying
to cover something up.

555
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:25,332
Now you tell your mother if
she doesn't call me tomorrow,

556
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,933
I'm getting in touch
with social services.

557
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,399
<i>Attention, shoppers,</i>

558
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,399
<i>if this is your last token,</i>
<i>don't blow it.</i>

559
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,266
<i>There are no more turns.</i>

560
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,332
All children should have pets.

561
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,132
Success is
the most important goal.

562
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:45,099
Boy: <i>What are you
making with those cans?</i>

563
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,832
I'm not making anything.

564
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,332
They're there for
intellectual stimulation.

565
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,666
That is the greatest gift we
mothers can give our children.

566
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:56,032
- What is?
- Intellectual stimulation.

567
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:59,067
She looks like some teacher just
dying to bum out some children.

568
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,032
Hi.

569
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:09,866
Cleanliness is
next to godliness.

570
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:12,266
She looks like a real gloom.
Let's get out of here pronto.

571
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:14,732
I can't get too much
of the outdoors.

572
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:16,866
<i>I love doing things with kids.</i>

573
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,966
What other things
do you do with them?

574
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:22,966
Oh, all kinds of things,
baseball, touch football,

575
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:25,999
fishing, hiking, bird walks.

576
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,632
Do you like iguanas?

577
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:30,266
Love 'em. Fascinating species.

578
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:31,366
Do you play basketball?

579
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:34,199
You bet I do.

580
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,699
Here. Have a marshmallow.

581
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,699
- Thanks.
- Can I have one?

582
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,832
- I want one.
- Can I have one, please?

583
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,232
She's awesome. She would never
tear down the treehouse.

584
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:46,232
She's everything we
could want in a mother.

585
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:48,999
Now, Jeremy, we have to
use our heads about this.

586
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,067
We have to all want her.
What do you think of her?

587
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,299
Mmm. Good marshmallow.

588
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,032
Look, we gotta get somebody fast.
Leeby's gonna be back.

589
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:59,866
She likes iguanas, Elizabeth.

590
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,366
Face it, Elizabeth.
It's two to one.

591
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,399
Okay okay. We'll ask her.

592
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,199
- <i> Is it time to go?</i>
- Um, excuse me.

593
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,232
We'd like you to be our mother.

594
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:13,232
<i>No, I want her.</i>

595
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:18,132
Timeout! Let's count out
like good sports.

596
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,166
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

597
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,166
catch a tiger by the toe.

598
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:24,666
<i>If he hollers, let him go.</i>

599
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:27,299
I choose this one

600
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,099
right here.

601
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,733
Why don't you call me "mom"?

602
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,800
Can't have this nonsense
between me and the outdoors.

603
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,999
Ah, there.

604
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,766
Now I can settle in.

605
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:55,332
Well, ah, whose frilly pillow?

606
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,400
Get rid of it.

607
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,732
That's my college
field hockey team.

608
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:05,766
The year I was center forward,

609
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,732
<i>we were undefeated.</i>

610
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:11,200
Ah, taxidermy is my hobby.

611
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:17,066
I consider these
my masterpieces.

612
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,366
Meet Michael my iguana.

613
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:24,132
Oh, he's really neat, Harry.

614
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:27,366
We'll have to get you a mate for him.
Then you can breed them.

615
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:29,999
No, thanks, mom.
Michael's plenty.

616
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,332
Sometimes I even
forget to feed him.

617
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,332
We don't need
a whole lot of 'em.

618
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,766
Nonsense. If you get too many,

619
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,966
you can stuff some of 'em.

620
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,633
I'll teach you how.

621
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,199
All right,
watermelon seed fight.

622
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,199
Me and Harry against you guys.

623
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,800
<i>Aah!</i>

624
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:57,733
Ha ha!

625
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:01,266
Oh, look.

626
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,866
<i>Look at the size</i>
<i>of that raccoon.</i>

627
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,932
<i>We can catch him and stuff him!</i>

628
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:08,232
Elizabeth:
Wait, mom, don't hurt it!

629
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,632
- He has a family.
- Run, raccoon! Run!

630
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:15,399
Perfect. I can rig a special
trap to bag an animal that size.

631
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,132
Swahili natives taught it to me

632
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:19,132
when I was on safari
back in '82.

633
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:21,367
- Mom, he's just a helpless raccoon.
- Shh!

634
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,366
Excuse me. I was... whoa!

635
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:39,999
Beat it, buster,
before I call the police.

636
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,899
- <i> Mrs. Martin?</i>
- Maybe I didn't make myself clear!

637
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,367
Believe me, you haven't
heard the last of this.

638
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,166
Mom: <i>Hit the deck, kids.</i>

639
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:11,832
<i>The sun's been up for hours.</i>

640
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:16,233
<i>Only dudes and softies</i>
<i>sleep late in the morning.</i>

641
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,699
Now move it.
We are going camping today.

642
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,066
What smells so good?

643
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:27,300
My best griddlecakes.
Now up and at 'em.

644
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,232
When'd you come in here, Harry?

645
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,832
Last night. I was scared.

646
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,832
Wimp.

647
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,233
So heavy.

648
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,733
Elizabeth:
<i>Here, Harry, let me help you.</i>

649
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,799
<i>Elizabeth, give Harry</i>
<i>back his sleeping bag.</i>

650
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,632
Campers must learn to carry
their own equipment.

651
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,699
But he's tired
and he's only six.

652
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,366
Ah, we'll stop and rest then.

653
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:07,267
It's not much further anyway.

654
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:17,367
All right. It's just up there.

655
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:35,667
Here we are.

656
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:44,399
Well, let's get to work
and kick back.

657
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,299
Elizabeth, you and Jeremy
take the hatchet.

658
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,666
Cut some pine boughs
for our beds.

659
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:53,299
Harry, you start gathering
wood for the fire.

660
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,367
Ah, I brought us the biggest
steak you ever saw.

661
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:01,232
Um, mom, I gotta go.

662
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:03,432
- Go where?
- To the bathroom.

663
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:05,932
- So go.
- But where?

664
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:08,832
Where? Out there.

665
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,966
But I gotta go number two.

666
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:14,132
So go, Harry. Use leaves.

667
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:16,132
Ah, Elizabeth, Jeremy.

668
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:18,800
L-leaves?!

669
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,399
Mom, I can't sleep.

670
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,832
The mosquitoes keep biting me.

671
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:34,866
Get down under
your sleeping bag then.

672
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,932
Then I get all sweaty.

673
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:38,999
If you're going to be a camper,

674
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
you have to be a man, Harry.

675
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:49,400
<i>Spread your ponchos over your
sleeping bags and go to sleep.</i>

676
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:20,232
We'll be back as soon
as the weather changes.

677
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:23,399
Let's sing a rousing marching
song to give us some pep.

678
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,399
♪ Tramp tramp tramp,
the boys are marching ♪

679
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,666
♪ Cheer up, comrades,
they will come ♪

680
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,832
♪ In the prison cell I sit ♪

681
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,032
♪ Thinking,
mother dear, of you ♪

682
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:41,899
<i>♪ And our sweet and happy home</i>
<i>so far away ♪</i>

683
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,666
<i>♪ tramp tramp tramp,</i>
<i>the boys are marching ♪</i>

684
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,899
- <i> ♪ cheer up, comrades... ♪</i>
- Whoa!

685
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,732
Harry! Wait, mom.
Harry needs help.

686
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:54,332
- ♪ They fill my eyes... ♪
- <i> Mom!</i>

687
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:58,633
- ♪ Though I try to cheer my comrades... ♪
- <i> Mom!</i>

688
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,732
Jeremy: I got more scratches yesterday
than I did in my whole life.

689
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:12,732
Thank god for bad weather.

690
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,732
Yeah, but for how long?

691
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:17,632
One sunny day, and we have
to go back out there.

692
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:19,632
- You guys up there?
- <i> Yeah. Hi.</i>

693
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:21,699
Wanna play a game of kickball?

694
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,066
- Okay.
- Cool.

695
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:26,066
- Well, girls get...
- Okay, I want...

696
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:28,632
kids, what's going on out here?

697
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,632
- We're playing kickball.
- Super.

698
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:32,366
Kickball's a favorite of mine.

699
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:34,132
Elizabeth'll be captain
of one team.

700
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,132
<i>I'll be captain of the other.</i>

701
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,032
We don't use captains.
We just play.

702
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:40,767
Well, then it's high time
you learned to do it right.

703
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:43,866
- My kickball.
- Harry,

704
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:47,099
you, you, you and you
on Elizabeth's team.

705
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,032
Jeremy, you're on mine. I'll take these
kids here and their little brother.

706
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:53,032
<i>We let the kids</i>
<i>who are under five</i>

707
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:54,766
be on both sides,
because they like

708
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:56,366
to be up to bat better
than in the field.

709
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:58,366
If they're old enough to play,

710
00:44:58,367 --> 00:45:00,466
they're old enough
to obey the rules.

711
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:03,066
Oh, that little one there's
too young to play.

712
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,299
But he always plays.
It's his favorite thing.

713
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,199
Well, I'm sorry. This is
not a sport for a toddler.

714
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,199
Well, if he's not playing,
I'm not playing either then.

715
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,233
<i>Come on, Luke. Let's go home.</i>

716
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:18,399
We've gotta go.

717
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,766
All right now, let's play ball!

718
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:23,699
- Hey, I'm catcher.
- I'm third base.

719
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,667
- I'm second.
- Lily, you're up first.

720
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:28,966
Ah.

721
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:31,133
<i>Strike one!</i>

722
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:38,832
<i>Strike two.</i>

723
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:41,132
Mom, you're
throwing it too fast.

724
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:43,133
<i>She can't kick it like that.</i>

725
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:48,066
Strike three. Out.

726
00:45:48,067 --> 00:45:50,632
Move over. Next man up.

727
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:52,866
I didn't get my turn yet.

728
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:54,832
- Yes you did.
- No I didn't.

729
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,799
I didn't get my turn. When?

730
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,266
You're not fair. That's not
how Elizabeth pitched.

731
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:03,166
If you're going to play,
you have to do it right.

732
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:05,732
Three strikes, and you're out.

733
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:07,032
But she always gets a home run.

734
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:10,366
Not unless she kicks
it good and hard.

735
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,399
You're ruining it all.
Come on, Lily.

736
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,366
Let's go over to Sally's house.
We can play

737
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:17,267
- with her brother.
- Yeah, let's go.

738
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,899
<i>We can play it the right way.</i>

739
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,266
- Yeah, me too.
- Let's go.

740
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:26,366
Huh.

741
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,633
Well, I can see you guys
need some serious training.

742
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:32,866
<i>Let's start with push-ups.</i>

743
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:36,867
Everyone drop and give me 20.
Drop!

744
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:45,066
One, two, three, four, five.

745
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,399
What did we do wrong?

746
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,232
We thought she was the
exact opposite of mama.

747
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:50,399
<i>She seemed wonderful at first.</i>

748
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,732
You made
a very natural mistake.

749
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:54,799
You thought because
she was interested

750
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,066
in different things than mama,

751
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:59,032
she'd be a different
kind of person.

752
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:02,432
Well, down at the roots,
they're the same.

753
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:04,432
The same?
What do you mean the same?

754
00:47:04,433 --> 00:47:06,666
There was never anybody
more different.

755
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:10,366
Mama seemed to only care
about how you looked, right?

756
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:12,332
- Yes.
- Hey, wait a minute.

757
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,866
Think about it.
How did mom pick us?

758
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:17,399
- <i> Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.</i>
- <i> Yeah. So?</i>

759
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,632
It really didn't make any
difference what kids she got.

760
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:23,632
Yeah, all she wanted
was the winner.

761
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,199
- Right.
- So we don't have to worry about hurting her feelings

762
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,332
when we tell her to go
back to the mommy market.

763
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:30,666
And I think you better
tell her right away.

764
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:32,666
You need to have a quiet day
by yourselves

765
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:34,332
before you try another one.

766
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,799
I'm scared to try again.

767
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,899
This is our last chance.

768
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,266
Yeah, what are we gonna do if
we don't pick the right one?

769
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:46,133
Ms. Cavour, do you think we're
ever gonna find a mother?

770
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,666
Well, I think
the mistake you make

771
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,999
is being fooled by all
the fancy trappings.

772
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,999
These are zinnias.

773
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,466
<i>Good mothers are rather</i>
<i>like zinnias, dependable,</i>

774
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:02,432
but they can surprise you.

775
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:05,967
They're really
quite extraordinary.

776
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,932
- Jeremy:<i> Mom.</i>
- Yeah.

777
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:14,266
I'm up here

778
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:17,400
setting a trap
for that raccoon we spotted.

779
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:24,766
Mom, come on down. We gotta
talk to you man to man.

780
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:28,699
Oh, good. What about?

781
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,699
We feel that we don't
suit each other,

782
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,099
and we think you should go
back to the mommy market.

783
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,999
Nonsense. We haven't had
a real camping trip yet.

784
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,166
We don't want one either.

785
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,032
Ah, don't chicken out
on me now.

786
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:42,966
We've hardly
gotten off the ground.

787
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:45,766
Mom, be a good sport and
play the rules of the game.

788
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:47,833
Yeah, don't be a poor sport.

789
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:52,266
You're right.

790
00:48:52,267 --> 00:48:54,400
You're right.

791
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,899
I'd never want it said
that I'm a poor loser.

792
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,332
Well, I'll just
gather my things,

793
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,399
go inside and be on my way.

794
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,667
Ahh.

795
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:13,700
Cheerio.

796
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,166
I hate your picks.

797
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:23,033
You both pick really
gross, horrible mothers.

798
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,966
Do you guys ever try to
remember our real mother?

799
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:31,067
Why? Do you remember
something about her?

800
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,999
No.

801
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,966
I was just trying to.

802
00:49:38,967 --> 00:49:40,999
All I remember is

803
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,967
that we wanted
to get rid of her.

804
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,332
You know, I'm getting scared.

805
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,266
This is our last pick
at the mommy market.

806
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:55,066
<i>What if we pick</i>
<i>the wrong mother?</i>

807
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:58,199
Oh, Elizabeth,
I just want a good mother.

808
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,199
I want one I like.

809
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,333
Don't worry. I'll
pick one you like...

810
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,167
Someone really extraordinary.

811
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:12,167
- Wow!
- No.

812
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,832
- I want her.
- Forget it.

813
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,899
We'll blimp out like
that other little girl.

814
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,900
- Ooh, chocolate.
- Come on.

815
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,032
Oh!

816
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:30,399
Do you teach kids to juggle?

817
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,399
Why, of course.

818
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,232
Children are soul of circus.

819
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,066
What if they don't
wanna be in the circus?

820
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,266
Uhh. Who would like
to join circus?

821
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:42,199
Me me me!

822
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,132
Ah! Mwah mwah mwah mwah!

823
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:46,132
I want her. She seems nice.

824
00:50:46,133 --> 00:50:48,132
Please, I'm not even
discussing her.

825
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:50,132
Yeah, but I didn't get a pick!

826
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:51,966
You said we'd get one I'd like.

827
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:54,632
Now it's my turn,
and I want her.

828
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:57,999
This is our last shot. We gotta be
careful and pick someone really good.

829
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,932
Well, if you don't like
her, I want the cookie one.

830
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:04,099
Harry, stop being such a baby.

831
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,132
We gotta use our heads about this.
This is serious.

832
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:09,066
I am serious.
I'm not being a baby.

833
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:10,832
You're not fair.

834
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:13,666
Everyone I want,
you don't want.

835
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:16,299
I'm not picking anyone you want.
Look what you got us.

836
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,732
<i>It's my turn</i>
<i>and I wanna pick too.</i>

837
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:21,399
And, Elizabeth,
she's extraordinary.

838
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,167
She juggles.

839
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:27,199
<i>This is our last token.</i>

840
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,932
- Sure about this?
- Yes.

841
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:32,066
Please deposit your token.

842
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:34,267
Hah! Ohh! Ha!

843
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:38,332
Ah, since we're all

844
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:41,099
going to be part of troupe,
why don't you guys

845
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,399
call me my name, Natasha.

846
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,832
Okay, let's go. Hurry!

847
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,932
Ah, there they are.

848
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:51,932
That's our bus. Ah, mwah.

849
00:51:51,933 --> 00:51:54,266
Been with us 20 years.

850
00:51:54,267 --> 00:51:56,266
It's gone everywhere with us.

851
00:51:56,267 --> 00:51:58,867
Us? Who's us?

852
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:24,332
It's too high.

853
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:27,200
Pretend you are flying.

854
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,899
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

855
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,899
Work with me.

856
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,900
Come over here.

857
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,667
Perfect.

858
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:48,099
Don't move.

859
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,833
Whatever you do, don't move.

860
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:21,066
This is ridiculous.

861
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:22,999
We've got a three-ring
circus in our backyard.

862
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,899
<i>Elizabeth, we gotta</i>
<i>get rid of her.</i>

863
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,766
Okay, we'll tell her
to go back. That's all.

864
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:29,099
But then we'll have
no mother at all.

865
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,132
Natasha: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

866
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:36,132
boys and girls, may I have
your attention, please?

867
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:38,632
Tonight in our center ring...

868
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:41,032
Natasha, look at me!

869
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:43,632
No, big guy! No, don't do it!

870
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:45,833
My bike!

871
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,399
Natasha: <i>Okay, little guy,
we've got the bed here.</i>

872
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,033
<i>Okay, now we must practice</i>
<i>the double somersault.</i>

873
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,699
Okay, go.

874
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,866
- <i> Oh! Very good.</i>
- Natasha.

875
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:12,799
Ah, why you kids
not practicing?

876
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,899
We've got a show to do.

877
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,799
Natasha, look, we're sorry,
but we'd like you to leave.

878
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,832
And we want you to take
everybody else with you.

879
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,866
Ah, what is this?

880
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:23,866
We're about to go on tour.

881
00:54:23,867 --> 00:54:26,866
Yeah, vell, ve don't
want to go on tour.

882
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:28,799
And we want you to get out.

883
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,099
Ah, don't be ridiculous.

884
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,366
- <i> Right, big guy?</i>
- That's right.

885
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:36,732
Right. Okay, little guy. Okay.

886
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:38,399
<i>Man, we're stuck with her.</i>

887
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,399
Natasha: <i>Very, very good.</i>

888
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,932
- <i> don't bet on it.</i>
- <i> Yeah, very good.</i>

889
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:46,266
<i>Okay, go.</i>

890
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:48,733
<i>Very good.</i>

891
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,632
More gas, Harry, the long one.

892
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:08,799
<i>The long one.</i>

893
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,299
Now remember, just go around
the block a couple of times.

894
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,132
- We know.
- We just want to get them

895
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:17,799
- out of the house.
- We know, Elizabeth. We know.

896
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,300
<i>And be careful!</i>

897
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,266
<i>Wake up!</i>
<i>Someone's stealing the bus!</i>

898
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:35,699
Someone's stealing the bus!

899
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,499
- Natasha, get up!
- The bus!

900
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,467
Someone's stealing the bus!

901
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:43,367
The bus, it's over there!

902
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,166
<i>Okay, Harry, I'm gonna</i>
<i>try and pull over now.</i>

903
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:54,366
<i>Not so much gas.</i>
<i>Harry, start to brake.</i>

904
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,833
I am.

905
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:59,366
Harry, I said brake.

906
00:55:59,367 --> 00:56:02,332
Harry. Harry, hit the brakes!

907
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:03,632
- I am.
- Harry!

908
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:05,766
Hit the brakes, Harry!
Hit the brakes!

909
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:08,232
Stop kicking me.
Which one's the brakes?

910
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:11,333
Aah!

911
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:16,400
Are you okay?

912
00:56:17,533 --> 00:56:20,600
Yeah, I think so.

913
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:24,400
Come on.

914
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:27,767
Come on!

915
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,866
Hey, where are you go?

916
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:34,299
- Let go of me, you big...
- Where are you going?

917
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,599
- <i> Let go of me!</i>
- <i> Hey!</i>

918
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,432
Harry, help!

919
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:41,867
- Yaah!
- Hey.

920
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,399
Way to go, Harry.
And I called you a wimp?

921
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,199
Natasha:<i> Open up!</i>

922
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,899
- Open up!
- <i> Should we open it?</i>

923
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,899
- We've come to get our stuff.
- <i> We have to open it.</i>

924
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,166
- <i> You wrecked the bus.</i>
- <i> We didn't mean to.</i>

925
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:01,232
We have a show to do.
We're leaving.

926
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:03,900
<i>Look, I'll open it.</i>

927
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:14,932
Elizabeth: <i>We're sorry.</i>

928
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:17,732
How could you?

929
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:19,766
Huh? How could you?

930
00:57:19,767 --> 00:57:21,732
Jeremy:
<i>Well, you wouldn't leave.</i>

931
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,667
It was our bus.

932
00:57:27,467 --> 00:57:30,500
Our beautiful, beautiful bus.

933
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:39,932
We are going back
to the mommy market

934
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:44,600
and looking for kids
who understand...

935
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:48,467
<i>That the show must go on.</i>

936
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,366
<i>Always the show must go on.</i>

937
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:56,867
Get our stuff.

938
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:28,167
<i>See what I mean,</i>
<i>Dr. Richardson?</i>

939
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:56,932
What are we gonna eat tomorrow?

940
00:58:56,933 --> 00:59:00,666
Yeah, and who's gonna
take us grocery shopping?

941
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:03,799
<i>And who's gonna tuck us in and
make sure we eat and everything?</i>

942
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,999
We can't go back
to the mommy market,

943
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,932
so who is gonna
take care of us?

944
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:09,933
Harry, stop it. Just stop it.

945
00:59:13,933 --> 00:59:15,932
They're back.

946
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:17,866
<i>Children?</i>

947
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:21,366
Children, open the door.

948
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:23,332
<i>Children.</i>

949
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,366
Children, open this door!

950
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,932
I know you're in there!

951
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:31,166
- I know you're in...
- This isn't the way.

952
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,332
We need to contact
the proper authorities

953
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:35,332
and get them into foster homes.

954
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:37,533
Foster homes?

955
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:10,332
It's all my fault.

956
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:12,766
<i>I used up our last turn</i>
<i>on a stupid mother.</i>

957
01:00:12,767 --> 01:00:14,699
Now I have no mother at all,

958
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,699
and they won't let us back
at the mommy market.

959
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,566
You gotta help us.
Is there any way

960
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:20,832
we can go back to the mommy
market and try one more time?

961
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:23,299
What's the use?
I hate them all.

962
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:27,866
- I just wish we could find our own mother.
- Me too.

963
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:30,866
If only we could remember
something about her.

964
01:00:30,867 --> 01:00:34,799
Mrs. Cavour, why can't we
remember anything about her?

965
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,366
Well, that's
a typical manifestation

966
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:40,599
- of the enchantment.
- The what?

967
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,832
The enchantment, sorcery.
The name doesn't matter.

968
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:45,832
It's what's taken
your mother away.

969
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:48,499
I don't understand.

970
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:52,266
Why can't we remember her?
Where'd she go?

971
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:56,666
I told you erasing memory
was a dangerous game.

972
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:58,632
Of course you don't remember.

973
01:00:58,633 --> 01:01:01,232
Memory would break the spell.

974
01:01:01,233 --> 01:01:03,266
That's the way
with enchantment.

975
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:06,499
<i>But if you did break it</i>
<i>and got her back,</i>

976
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,266
<i>you'd remember quite clearly.</i>

977
01:01:09,267 --> 01:01:11,399
She isn't lost, you know.

978
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,732
She's only misplaced.

979
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:18,332
But how can we break it?
There must be some way.

980
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:20,432
Yeah, how can we get her back?

981
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:22,199
Yeah, where is she?

982
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,732
The only way you can break
the enchantment

983
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:27,932
is to pick your mother,

984
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:30,699
really and truly pick her.

985
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,532
Wait. Is she at
the mommy market?

986
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:34,232
How do we recognize her?

987
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,866
Will you make some flower magic

988
01:01:35,867 --> 01:01:37,832
<i>so we'll remember her?</i>

989
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,332
Oh, you'll have
to make your own.

990
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:40,732
After all,
she's your own mother.

991
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:42,399
How do we do that?
We don't know any magic?

992
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,432
Well, a spell isn't essential,

993
01:01:45,433 --> 01:01:49,832
but it can't hurt
to have a nice one.

994
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:51,899
Why don't you see what happens

995
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,367
if you say the names
of wildflowers?

996
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,666
I can't think of any.

997
01:01:57,667 --> 01:01:59,799
Well, think of where
they grow in the woods

998
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,299
<i>or in the swamps in the spring</i>

999
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,732
or the fields in the summer.

1000
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:05,766
- Daisies!
- Good.

1001
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:07,499
Violets and buttercups.

1002
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,899
Oh, I know. Lady-slippers,

1003
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,599
- pink ones and yellow ones.
- <i> Daisies.</i>

1004
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,399
Harry,
you already said daisies.

1005
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,466
I know. I like daisies.
I want them in again.

1006
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,666
Oh, devil's paintbrush
and skunk cabbage.

1007
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,666
Take that back.

1008
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:21,699
No, your mother
isn't perfect, you know.

1009
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,366
Skunk cabbage is one of the first
flowers to bloom in the spring,

1010
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,666
and I for one am always
very glad to see it.

1011
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:29,399
Black-eyed Susan.

1012
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,266
Wild roses and water lilies.

1013
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:32,566
Forget-me-nots.

1014
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:34,466
I think that will be
quite adequate,

1015
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:36,566
and it certainly
sounds like you.

1016
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:40,432
I'm sure it'll be a help
to you remembering your mother.

1017
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:43,166
But don't get discouraged,
and remember,

1018
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:46,499
<i>ad matrem per espera.</i>

1019
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,332
That's on the tokens.
What does it mean?

1020
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:53,300
It means it's hard work to
find out who your mother is.

1021
01:03:02,867 --> 01:03:05,500
He's not looking. Come on.

1022
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,699
Harry, don't worry.

1023
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,699
We'll get Michael back.

1024
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,566
We have to get a token.

1025
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:19,532
I don't wanna do it.

1026
01:03:19,533 --> 01:03:23,167
Harry, would you rather
have an iguana or a mother?

1027
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:32,366
Oh, Jean-Pierre.

1028
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:35,200
<i>Oh no, Jean-Pierre.</i>

1029
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,367
Oh, Jean-Pierre,
you are an animal.

1030
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:55,866
Okay, now! Come on!

1031
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:57,899
You guys keep watch.

1032
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,900
- <i> What's going on?</i>
- <i> What's chasing the kids?</i>

1033
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:09,633
- Shoot.
- Hurry up. Come on.

1034
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:20,600
They're coming this way!
They're coming!

1035
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,200
Security's coming.

1036
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:27,932
Michael! Where's Michael?

1037
01:04:27,933 --> 01:04:31,299
<i>They're scaring Michael.</i>
<i>We gotta find Michael.</i>

1038
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,266
Harry, come on!

1039
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:37,266
I know those kids. They
don't play by the rules.

1040
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:40,866
- I'll handle this.
- That's mine!

1041
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:44,300
- <i> Moms are chasing the kids.</i>
- The kids are pretty fast.

1042
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,967
Stop them!
Those kids are thieves!

1043
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,233
- Whoo! Look out below.
- Whoa!

1044
01:05:13,267 --> 01:05:14,867
Uhh!

1045
01:05:18,933 --> 01:05:20,432
Whoa.

1046
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:23,499
Elizabeth, Jeremy, harrington,

1047
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,166
you are finished.
This is the end

1048
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,866
- of your uncouth little game.
- Hey! Help!

1049
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:30,899
- I've got you now.
- Let him go.

1050
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,366
- Help! Please!
- Let him go.

1051
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:35,632
- Help!
- Elizabeth, catch.

1052
01:05:35,633 --> 01:05:37,467
Help!

1053
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:08,866
You kids were advised
of the rules.

1054
01:06:08,867 --> 01:06:13,366
<i>Stealing a token</i>
<i>doesn't make any difference.</i>

1055
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:15,632
<i>You have no more turns.</i>

1056
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:20,366
<i>Now go on, get out of here.</i>

1057
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:23,467
<i>You broke the rules.</i>
<i>Understand?</i>

1058
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:26,667
You can never come back.

1059
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:32,332
Yes, I know.
I've got the papers

1060
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:34,199
from the social
services department.

1061
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,199
<i>I followed the kids</i>
<i>into this area.</i>

1062
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,866
<i>They're somewhere around here.</i>

1063
01:06:37,867 --> 01:06:39,932
<i>Let's search the area,</i>
<i>and if we come up empty...</i>

1064
01:06:39,933 --> 01:06:41,932
- Stay back.
- <i> ...We'll head back to their house.</i>

1065
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:44,566
It's leeby with the police.

1066
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,832
<i>They're finding foster homes</i>
<i>for them right now.</i>

1067
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:49,300
I've got some pictures.
I'll show you.

1068
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,299
Come on. If our mother's in
there, we've gotta find her.

1069
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,933
- I don't care what happened.
- Elizabeth!

1070
01:07:09,933 --> 01:07:12,266
Where are they?

1071
01:07:12,267 --> 01:07:14,632
It's gone.

1072
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:16,633
Elizabeth, it's gone.

1073
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:32,632
Edward: <i>You broke the rules.</i>

1074
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:36,767
<i>Understand?</i>
<i>You can never come back.</i>

1075
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:58,432
What's gonna happen to us?

1076
01:07:58,433 --> 01:08:02,432
Are they gonna send us away?
Huh? What's gonna happen?

1077
01:08:02,433 --> 01:08:04,666
What are we gonna do,
Elizabeth?

1078
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:07,399
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

1079
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,833
We can't go on all alone.

1080
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:15,299
You gotta do something, Elizabeth.
Please do something.

1081
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,299
What am I supposed to do?

1082
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,667
I don't know what to do. What
would you want me to do?

1083
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
Stop asking me.

1084
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:28,666
I'm not your mother.
I'm just a kid.

1085
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:30,667
I don't know!

1086
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:51,567
I'm sorry, Jeremy.

1087
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,432
I'm feeling really scared,
Elizabeth.

1088
01:08:58,433 --> 01:09:01,800
I know. So am I.

1089
01:09:04,733 --> 01:09:08,166
No, I just want
a mother who knows me,

1090
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:10,300
you know, who loves me.

1091
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,699
I just want my own mother.

1092
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,766
Me too.

1093
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:19,166
We have to try to remember her.

1094
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,799
<i>We just have to remember her.</i>

1095
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,699
Daisies, daisies, daisies.

1096
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,567
Why isn't it working,
Elizabeth?

1097
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,300
Daisies.

1098
01:09:35,733 --> 01:09:37,767
We're never gonna remember her.

1099
01:09:41,867 --> 01:09:45,166
Know what?

1100
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:47,666
Let's make up a memory together

1101
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,932
about a trip
we took with our mother,

1102
01:09:49,933 --> 01:09:51,932
<i>someplace special.</i>

1103
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:55,199
How can you make a memory about
someone you can't remember?

1104
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,567
Well, we could just imagine
how we'd want it to be.

1105
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:06,666
Okay, but make up
an exiting one.

1106
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:10,866
Yeah, one that happened
yesterday to all of us.

1107
01:10:10,867 --> 01:10:13,566
Yesterday's kind of hard.
It just happened.

1108
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:15,599
Elizabeth, we're pretending.

1109
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,832
Yeah, we went to fox hill
pond and I caught a fish.

1110
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:20,899
No, we didn't.
We went to the beach,

1111
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,799
the real beach by the ocean.

1112
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,166
Not me. I went to the woods,

1113
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:28,632
where I'd never been before.

1114
01:10:28,633 --> 01:10:31,600
I found a secret waterfall.

1115
01:10:34,567 --> 01:10:37,166
I know. You know what we did?

1116
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:39,732
The reason why
it was such an adventure

1117
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:42,199
is because we couldn't decide
which one we wanted to do,

1118
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,932
so our mother decided that
we should do everything.

1119
01:10:45,933 --> 01:10:48,332
- <i> She did?</i>
- Yes.

1120
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,932
Mother woke us up really early,

1121
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:54,632
<i>and we got to the beach before
the sun had even come up.</i>

1122
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:57,366
<i>There was no one there but us,</i>

1123
01:10:57,367 --> 01:10:59,432
<i>just our mother and us.</i>

1124
01:10:59,433 --> 01:11:01,499
<i>It was like being</i>
<i>on the edge of the land,</i>

1125
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,966
<i>on the edge of the sea,</i>

1126
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:06,000
<i>the edge of the day</i>
<i>all at once.</i>

1127
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,232
<i>It was really cold</i>
<i>that morning,</i>

1128
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:19,266
<i>so our mother bundled us up</i>
<i>and made a fire of driftwood.</i>

1129
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:21,266
Jeremy: <i>And then we all
played with the waves,</i>

1130
01:11:21,267 --> 01:11:23,232
<i>racing them in to shore.</i>

1131
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:26,232
Harry: <i>Yeah, and our feet
got really freezing,</i>

1132
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:27,632
<i>but we didn't even notice</i>

1133
01:11:27,633 --> 01:11:30,499
<i>'cause we were</i>
<i>having so much fun.</i>

1134
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,699
Elizabeth: <i>The only sounds
were us running and laughing</i>

1135
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,799
<i>and the sea gulls squawking.</i>

1136
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,900
<i>There's something magical</i>
<i>about us being alone out there.</i>

1137
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:43,732
Jeremy:<i> I remember mom</i>

1138
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:45,599
<i>told us a story she made up</i>

1139
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,933
<i>about us all</i>
<i>running away to sea.</i>

1140
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:51,766
Elizabeth: <i>And then she told us</i>

1141
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:55,899
<i>that every time</i>
<i>we got to watch a sunrise,</i>

1142
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,900
<i>god was telling us a secret.</i>

1143
01:12:01,767 --> 01:12:04,732
Jeremy: <i>Later in the day,
we followed a little brook,</i>

1144
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:08,366
<i>and its clear brown pools</i>
<i>weren't even knee-deep.</i>

1145
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:10,899
Harry: <i>Yeah, and our
sneakers got all wet</i>

1146
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,332
<i>and made squishy noises</i>
<i>when we walked.</i>

1147
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,599
Elizabeth:
<i>We discovered this great rock,</i>

1148
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,366
<i>where we decided to have our picnic
that our mother had made us.</i>

1149
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:21,899
Jeremy: <i>But the best was
that beneath the rock,</i>

1150
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,932
<i>there was this</i>
<i>terrific little pool</i>

1151
01:12:23,933 --> 01:12:26,566
<i>that had a magnificent</i>
<i>waterfall</i>

1152
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:28,566
<i>spilling over an old stone dam.</i>

1153
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:31,399
<i>Me and mom swam out first</i>
<i>to check out how deep it was.</i>

1154
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,399
Harry: <i>No fair.</i>

1155
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,532
- <i> How come we didn't go?</i>
- Elizabeth:<i> We did, Harry.</i>

1156
01:12:35,533 --> 01:12:37,867
<i>Mom just wanted to make sure</i>
<i>it was safe for you.</i>

1157
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,332
Jeremy: <i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1158
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:45,267
<i>We felt like we were the
first people there in years.</i>

1159
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,766
Harry: <i>And then we all went?</i>

1160
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:17,266
<i>Yeah, we came back</i>
<i>to get you guys.</i>

1161
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:20,166
Elizabeth: <i>You did a great
job swimming, Harry.</i>

1162
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:22,166
Harry:
<i>Yeah, I'm sure our mother</i>

1163
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:24,899
<i>was really proud of me since</i>
<i>she taught me how to swim.</i>

1164
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,899
Elizabeth: <i>She sure was.</i>

1165
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,932
<i>Then after lunch,</i>
<i>we laid down and slept</i>

1166
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:31,566
<i>'cause we had woken up</i>
<i>so early.</i>

1167
01:13:31,567 --> 01:13:33,632
Jeremy: <i>I doubt I slept.</i>

1168
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:35,732
<i>I just stayed</i>
<i>under the waterfall</i>

1169
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:37,932
<i>watching the sun</i>
<i>come through the trees</i>

1170
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:40,500
<i>while the rest of you slept.</i>

1171
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:47,266
Harry: <i>It was in the evening,</i>

1172
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:49,232
<i>when the pond</i>
<i>was really smooth,</i>

1173
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:51,932
<i>except for the bugs</i>
<i>flying so low</i>

1174
01:13:51,933 --> 01:13:54,199
<i>they hit the water sometimes.</i>

1175
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,199
Jeremy:
<i>We were all really quiet.</i>

1176
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,199
Elizabeth: <i>Yeah, mommy told us</i>

1177
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,799
<i>we'd scare the fish away</i>
<i>if we talked too much.</i>

1178
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,499
Harry:
<i>I was just reeling my line in,</i>

1179
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,999
<i>and suddenly</i>
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

1180
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,266
<i>There's a humongous fish on it!</i>

1181
01:14:07,267 --> 01:14:09,232
Come on, Harry! Bring it up!

1182
01:14:09,233 --> 01:14:11,932
Pull! Pull! Come on! Pull.
Reel, reel, reel.

1183
01:14:11,933 --> 01:14:14,432
- Hard as you can.
- Hard as you can. Come on.

1184
01:14:14,433 --> 01:14:16,400
Come on. You can do it.

1185
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,466
- My gosh.
- It's huge.

1186
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:22,467
Look at this, Harry.
You got one.

1187
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,832
Okay, guys. Hold up the fish.

1188
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:30,199
<i>Smile.</i>

1189
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,266
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

1190
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,267
Terrific.

1191
01:14:41,267 --> 01:14:44,399
Jeremy: <i>Except it was a
sucker, so you threw it back.</i>

1192
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,399
Harry: <i>I don't mind
if I threw it back,</i>

1193
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,866
<i>'cause that means</i>
<i>it's still alive.</i>

1194
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:50,866
Elizabeth:
<i>It was a real beauty,</i>

1195
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:52,866
<i>looked like</i>
<i>it was made of silver.</i>

1196
01:14:52,867 --> 01:14:54,867
Yay, Harry.

1197
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,666
We had a terrific day,

1198
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:01,433
an absolute perfect yesterday.

1199
01:15:06,733 --> 01:15:09,566
She's out there
somewhere very close.

1200
01:15:09,567 --> 01:15:12,666
I can feel it.

1201
01:15:12,667 --> 01:15:14,667
I want her back so much.

1202
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:20,166
I only want our mother,

1203
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:22,632
our very own mother.

1204
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:26,232
Me too. Me too.

1205
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:28,233
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

1206
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:46,932
Wake up, lazybones.

1207
01:15:46,933 --> 01:15:49,466
<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

1208
01:15:49,467 --> 01:15:51,900
I have to leave in 10 minutes, honey.
Now hurry up.

1209
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:03,933
You can't go around
doing whatever you want.

1210
01:16:08,867 --> 01:16:13,332
Elizabeth, since you're
almost in the eighth grade,

1211
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:16,267
I'm sure you're capable
of doing your own laundry.

1212
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,166
How did we get here?

1213
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,166
Harry, guess what I dreamed.

1214
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:32,332
Harry, Michael's back!

1215
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:34,932
- Look!
- Michael!

1216
01:16:34,933 --> 01:16:36,732
Michael!

1217
01:16:36,733 --> 01:16:40,632
Elizabeth, I remember!
I remember everything!

1218
01:16:40,633 --> 01:16:43,532
<i>Come on.</i>

1219
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:45,732
Look at that.

1220
01:16:45,733 --> 01:16:47,732
Wow. Where'd those come from?

1221
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:49,732
"I hope you slept well,
children."

1222
01:16:49,733 --> 01:16:51,499
Mrs. Cavour's voice:
<i>These are for your mother.</i>

1223
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,366
<i>Love, Mrs. Cavour.</i>

1224
01:16:53,367 --> 01:16:55,007
- Harry:<i> Mommy, you're back!</i>
- She's back.

1225
01:16:56,633 --> 01:16:58,699
Oh, what's going on?

1226
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:02,233
Mommy, mommy, mommy.
I love you so much.

1227
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,832
Oh, those flowers
are beautiful.

1228
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,599
What do you want for breakfast?

1229
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,599
Name it, anything.
We'll make it.

1230
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,432
Just leave it to us, and we're gonna
clean up the whole house, mom.

1231
01:17:13,433 --> 01:17:15,732
Now wait a minute. I meant
what I said last night.

1232
01:17:15,733 --> 01:17:18,766
You are grounded,
and there's no TV.

1233
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,932
Last night? That was weeks ago.

1234
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:22,932
Oh, come on.

1235
01:17:22,933 --> 01:17:24,499
Wait a minute.
What day is it, mommy?

1236
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,366
It's Saturday,
and I didn't forget

1237
01:17:26,367 --> 01:17:28,932
we have a visitor coming
this morning... Mr. Leeby,

1238
01:17:28,933 --> 01:17:30,732
- your school principal.
- <i> What?</i>

1239
01:17:30,733 --> 01:17:34,167
Huh? You mean
he's never shown up?

1240
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:38,466
Okay, guys, what are you up to?

1241
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:41,332
Oh, mom, I love you so much.

1242
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:44,666
We're never gonna do
anything bad ever again.

1243
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:48,199
Well, we'll try not to.

1244
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,866
That's good.
You're still grounded.

1245
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:52,299
Who cares?
We'll still do the garden

1246
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,732
and clean up the house
and do mommy's breakfast.

1247
01:17:54,733 --> 01:17:57,332
Oh, whatever
came over you guys?

1248
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:59,399
Mmm.

1249
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,399
What are you smiling...

1250
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,466
where did that come from?

1251
01:18:04,467 --> 01:18:07,666
It doesn't matter.
You wouldn't believe us.

1252
01:18:07,667 --> 01:18:09,732
- I'm just so glad you're here.
- Me, too.

1253
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:11,932
We have the best mother
in the whole world.

1254
01:18:11,933 --> 01:18:15,899
- Yeah, our mother.
- Oh, guys. Ohh.

1255
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,266
<i>What am I gonna have</i>
<i>for breakfast?</i>

1256
01:18:18,267 --> 01:18:20,266
Fresh-squeezed orange juice.

1257
01:18:20,267 --> 01:18:22,266
- Pancakes.
- Bacon and eggs.

1258
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:24,266
- We're great at pancakes.
- We're great at pancakes.

1259
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:29,166
So what am I gonna
tell Mr. Leeby?

1260
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:31,366
Tell him that we're
the best kids in the world.

1261
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:35,400
