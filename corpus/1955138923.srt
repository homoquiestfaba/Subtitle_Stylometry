1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,917
See that dog right there?

2
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,792
They were bred to protect
the Arctic villagers

3
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,917
from bear and wolf attacks.

4
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,500
You are so full of crap.

5
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:30,083
You kiss your mama
with that pottymouth?

6
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,583
I don't know
how he does it.

7
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,333
What do you mean?
It's his gift.

8
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,792
You know
all about "Star Wars"

9
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,083
and Travis is good
with the ladies.

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,458
We're all dealt a hand.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,958
Them dogs
live in the tundra.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,583
They don't swim
in the water.

13
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,917
You couldn't get
that dog in the water

14
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,750
for an F-150
full of Milk-Bones

15
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,917
driven by Lassie
wearing a two-piece,

16
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,875
even if it's a little
gold one like that.

17
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,333
So you're saying this dog
fights bears and wolves,

18
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,625
<i>but he's afraid
of the water.</i>

19
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,500
I see what you're doing.

20
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:59,375
You're sassing me, and that's
just 'cause you like me.

21
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:00,917
That's schoolyard 101.
It happens all the time.

22
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,667
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,625
Need I remind you, I let
you take Marcie Hoffman

24
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,833
to the Azalea Fest
in seventh grade?

25
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,375
<i>- You let me?
- I let you.</i>

26
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,375
Would you two shut up
and help me down?

27
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:13,458
Or would you prefer to watch
me slip and crack my skull?

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,875
Excuse me.
Look who's sassypants.

29
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,292
You keep that up, there's liable to
be some hair-pulling around here.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,667
Hey, Travis.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,458
Hiya, Monica.

32
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,500
Excuse me, ladies.

33
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,625
You got time to grab a beer
before y'all take off?

34
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,458
Well, I got to get
these knuckleheads home.

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Just one quick beer.

36
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,917
It'll be really fast,
I promise.

37
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:39,958
All right.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,625
<i>I don't think you and I
have ever had just one.</i>

39
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,958
- Bye, boys.
- Bye, Monica.

40
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:48,750
She's back.

41
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,792
Just like a boomerang.

42
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,333
Unbelievable.

43
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,625
Don't you start.

44
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,875
Can I just
say one thing?

45
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,125
If that one thing
is "boomerang,"

46
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,458
I'm going to tie
an anchor to your nuts

47
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,667
and throw it overboard.

48
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,042
Boomerang!

49
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,333
Hey!

50
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,958
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,375
Hey!

52
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:23,750
- Hey, hey!
- Hi!

53
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,792
Look alive, fellas.
Here come your wives.

54
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,958
Y'all better
start talking.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,667
We were about
to call the Coast Guard.

56
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,625
We got into some mackerel
about three miles out.

57
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,958
They were jumping
in the boat.

58
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,458
Price tag, bro.

59
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,792
Come on, kids.
Let's go.

60
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,750
Guarantee they've been
at Dockside since noon.

61
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:43,958
More fun
to let them think

62
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,458
they're getting
away with something.

63
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,417
- Mobe!
- Where is that damn dog?

64
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,542
<i>Useless!</i>

65
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,625
<i>This looks great, Travis.
Thank you.</i>

66
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,375
You're welcome!

67
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,542
See what he does to me?

68
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:36,458
<i>Someone bring me
a plate.</i>

69
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,875
<i>Y'all just
have a good time.</i>

70
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,000
Just kiss on each other
and just laugh it up.

71
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:41,625
I'll just be slaving
away over here

72
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,792
over the grill
like Cinderella.

73
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,083
<i>Hey, turn up the music!</i>

74
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,542
<i>Your burgers are burnt.</i>

75
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,458
<i>I'm not cutting down
that damn tree!</i>

76
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,667
<i>I grilled.
Y'all are cleaning.</i>

77
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,833
<i>Boy, get out of there.</i>

78
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,875
Fish guts gonna
make you sick.

79
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,458
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>

80
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,333
<i>- Night, Travis.
- Night.</i>

81
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,667
Put this on.
Put this on.

82
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:39,917
<i>Hey, Molly.</i>

83
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,625
Do you know
how many liters of blood

84
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,583
the circulatory system
processes per day on average?

85
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,708
My God!
20! That's right!

86
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,500
Good girl.
You got that right.

87
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,042
Mol.
How you feeling, honey?

88
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,458
Swollen nipples,
distended abdomen,

89
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,958
lethargic behavior.

90
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,708
My God,
this isn't happening.

91
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,375
This is like "Dirty
Dancing" all over again.

92
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:19,625
No, he did not!

93
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,625
- Excuse me.
- Hello!

94
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,458
Yeah, hi. Hello.

95
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,875
Sorry. Music's a little loud.
I didn't hear you.

96
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,708
Yes, it was.
It is so loud...

97
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,458
Hey, you're my new
neighbor, aren't you?

98
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,792
I've seen you
over there watching me.

99
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,000
- Watching you?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:42,500
My God.
I was not watching you.

101
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,042
You live 100 yards away.
Where am I supposed to look?

102
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,958
I'm just kidding with you.
I'm just playing.

103
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,042
- That is funny.
- What do you say we start over?

104
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,792
Why don't
you have a seat...

105
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,042
I do not want a seat,
thank you.

106
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,625
- Would you like a beer?
- I'm fine.

107
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,792
Come on, have a beer.
We got...

108
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
I do not want that.
Thank you.

109
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,792
All right.
Well, I'm Travis.

110
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,583
And the rug there,
that's Moby.

111
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,542
<i>- Yeah.
- And...</i>

112
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,042
I think this is the point
in the conversation

113
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,458
where you tell me
your name.

114
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,000
You do, do you?

115
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,667
Well, no.

116
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,458
Okay.

117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,625
All right.

118
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,000
Fine....

119
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,750
you know, there's a
certain type of woman

120
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:25,417
that usually shows up
here after 10:00.

121
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,875
<i>She's wearing ratty
sweatpants, no makeup,</i>

122
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:30,000
and she's usually
only after one thing.

123
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,333
My God.

124
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,542
Are you implying
I'm here for sex?

125
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,833
- You are, aren't you?
- My God.

126
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,333
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

127
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,958
Could you be
any more obnoxious?

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,750
- Lady, you have no idea.
- Lady! Stop calling me "lady".

129
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,750
- Then tell me your name.
- It is Gabby.

130
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,625
Hello, Gabby.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

131
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,750
What are you so angry about?

132
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,083
I am angry
about Molly's nipples.

133
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,625
Your stinky-ass dog took advantage
of my sweet little girl.

134
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,875
Now her nipples are swollen
and she's gained 15 pounds.

135
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,000
She will not get out of bed,

136
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,292
and you play
your music too loud!

137
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:08,000
So you're saying that Moby
there knocked up your dog?

138
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:11,542
I know Moby there
knocked up my dog.

139
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,958
He wanders
the neighborhood

140
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,958
day and night
unsupervised.

141
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,083
He has been wearing her down

142
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,667
since the moment
that we moved in.

143
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,417
- Wearing her down?
- That's right.

144
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,667
You're responsible.

145
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,417
That's right,
this is my fault.

146
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,417
It's all my fault.
I take full responsibility.

147
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,458
I've talked to him so many
times about using protection.

148
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,625
Don't patronize me.

149
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,042
- My God, you are...
- I'm sorry.

150
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,583
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

151
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,792
Look, you're right.
This is serious.

152
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:37,958
This is serious.
How long do we have?

153
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,958
I mean,
how far along is she?

154
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,958
God.
This is so funny to you.

155
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,333
It's a little funny, yeah.

156
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,667
Well, I'm not exactly sure,

157
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,458
because I haven't
taken her to the vet yet.

158
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
So how do you even know
she's pregnant?

159
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:51,458
Because I'm a medical student
and I'm also a woman.

160
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,792
The second I knew,
the first one is...

161
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:53,958
- You did?
- ...new information.

162
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,042
You're so smart.

163
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,375
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

164
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,417
Well, I like
your confidence.

165
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,667
And there happens to be a fantastic
clinic right here in town.

166
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,417
It's kind of
a father-son thing.

167
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,708
- Okay.
- And I want you to know,

168
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,792
Moby is not going to
be a deadbeat dad.

169
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,417
He's...
This is not going to be

170
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,542
one of them "Dirty Dancing"
type situations.

171
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,667
- Okay.
- He's going to stand up straight like a man.

172
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,875
Hey. Somebody say
"Dirty Dancing"?

173
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,958
- My God.
- I'll be inside

174
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,000
eating the rest
of the mint chip.

175
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:29,417
- I'll get you the card.
- You know, I'm good.

176
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,542
I can probably
figure this out...

177
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,625
- No, for the vet.
- ...on my own.

178
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:36,875
Good night!

179
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,417
Who was that?

180
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,792
Nobody.
It's a new neighbor.

181
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,750
Already bothering
the heck out of me.

182
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,458
Where's the damn ice cream?

183
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,375
What?

184
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:07,917
I'll tell you later.

185
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,875
Dad says hi.

186
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,958
<i>Our patients respond
to you, Gabby.</i>

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,042
Thank you, Doctor.

188
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,750
Don't thank me.

189
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,458
Just make sure you stay put
after you finish your boards.

190
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Now, you're going to get
all kinds of offers.

191
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:31,333
You just remember
who gave you your big break.

192
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,333
Good morning,
Dr. McCarthy.

193
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,625
Afternoon, Dr. McCarthy.

194
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,875
Well, I'm off to lunch.
Ryan, by the way,

195
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,875
your mama needs
a headcount for tonight.

196
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,083
Are you gonna bring
that lovely lady of yours?

197
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,625
Of course. Let us know if
we need to bring anything.

198
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,875
All right.

199
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:50,125
- Bye.
- Gabby, I'd like to have a word in private.

200
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

201
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,708
<i>Dr. Richards
to post-anesthesia.</i>

202
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,458
Why did you tell your dad

203
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,667
I was coming
for dinner tonight?

204
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,333
I have to study.

205
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,458
Because I'm selfish
and I want what I want.

206
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,000
Now tell me,
why are you staying

207
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,375
all the way out there
on the Sound

208
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,625
instead of on this side
of the bridge

209
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,625
where I can keep you
handcuffed to my side?

210
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,875
For your own safety
and well-being, of course.

211
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,333
That is why. That!

212
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,458
I have to study
for these boards.

213
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,042
Hey, I would get
nothing done otherwise.

214
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,833
Hi.

215
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,458
You must be Molly.

216
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,125
Which would make
this little girl Gabby.

217
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,875
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

218
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,583
No, no.
I'm Gabby. She's Molly.

219
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,833
Yeah.

220
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,042
I'm sorry we're late.

221
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,667
There was
an emergency at work.

222
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,583
Don't worry, honey,
I've heard it all.

223
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,917
Just admit you were off knocking
boots with somebody's husband.

224
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:39,708
I'm teasing.

225
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,583
My goodness, you should see
the look on your face.

226
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,625
Yeah.

227
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,833
Laura, are you giving
this young lady grief?

228
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,958
Well,
couldn't help myself.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,958
You know me...
How I get on Mondays.

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,458
For the record,
I had no idea

231
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,625
how she gets on Mondays.

232
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,458
- Okay.
- I'm Shep.

233
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,083
- You want to follow me back?
- Yeah, sure.

234
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,958
I'm counting three nuggets,
so congratulations.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,583
In a month, you're
gonna be a grandma.

236
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,708
But I'm too young!

237
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,042
Yeah, well,
these things happen.

238
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,958
We'll help you through it.

239
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,625
You have any idea who the
responsible party might be?

240
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,625
Responsible?

241
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,583
That word doesn't even belong in
the same zip code as this guy.

242
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,042
I meant the dog.

243
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,417
Right. Yes.

244
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,042
Well, apple
doesn't fall far.

245
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,500
I have it on good information
that the suspect in question

246
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,625
was neutered
seven months ago, Pop.

247
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,958
You? And you?

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,625
<i>It's awful cavalier of you</i>

249
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,792
<i>to point fingers at poor,
sweet, innocent Moby,</i>

250
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,375
considering six months ago

251
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,917
he was in a shelter
set to be put down.

252
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,625
Now, I didn't save his life

253
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,000
so he could suffer
undeserved persecution.

254
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,500
<i>And you'd think
as a medical student</i>

255
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,917
you'd be a little more
familiar with basic anatomy.

256
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,125
You know,
no balls, no babies.

257
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,542
Are you two, like...

258
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,792
- No. Hell, no.
- No. Eww. Gross!

259
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,500
Doc Shep,
Miss Norcross is here.

260
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,917
Apparently her tabby
is possessed again.

261
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,500
She needs you to do
that exorcism thing you do.

262
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,958
Just when it
was getting good.

263
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,083
<i>- You tricked me.
- No, no, no.</i>

264
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,625
I just having a little fun.

265
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,625
You showed up in my yard
all upset.

266
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,958
And then my sister shows up...

267
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,000
- Your sister?
- Yeah, I told you.

268
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,625
Ratty sweatpants,
no makeup.

269
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,750
Yeah, only after one thing.

270
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,750
Yeah, to raid my icebox.

271
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,750
No apology necessary.

272
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,583
Good, because
none was offered.

273
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,333
Damn, lady. Gabby.

274
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,750
You know, you threw
some pretty big stones

275
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,625
in my direction
the other night.

276
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,875
Calling my dog
stink-ass...

277
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,333
Yeah, well,
that stink-ass and you

278
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,000
interrupted my study

279
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:45,333
with all that barking and
that awful music you play.

280
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,750
<i>It's annoying.</i>

281
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,792
And for that,
we apologize.

282
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,042
Accepted.

283
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,792
You are one
difficult lady.

284
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,333
What do you say
we settle this

285
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,708
over a drink
at Dockside?

286
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,625
Okay. No.

287
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,958
- She wants to go again.
- No!

288
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,667
Monica, hey!
We're over here.

289
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,792
Man, they've been
on and off since high school.

290
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,458
He ain't ever
gonna commit.

291
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,958
- Hey.
- Hey.

292
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,667
- Hey! Good to see you.
- How are you? Hey, guys.

293
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,958
- Hey, how are you?
- Nice to see you.

294
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,417
- Hi.
- So...

295
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,625
who wants to play
Squirt the Jerk?

296
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,958
Would you like
to squirt a jerk?

297
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,417
- Sure, let's go.
- Squirt the Jerk.

298
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,792
All right, here we go
to squirt the jerk!

299
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,083
<i>All right! Come on.
Here we go now.</i>

300
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,958
<i>You're almost there.</i>

301
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,583
<i>He's all yours!</i>

302
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,542
<i>That's it.
Squirt the jerk!</i>

303
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,667
<i>You've done it! We've
got ourselves a winner!</i>

304
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,417
Come on!

305
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,417
<i>Congratulations, darling.
Everyone did a nice job.</i>

306
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,750
You want to go next?

307
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,875
- Let's get a candy apple.
- Candy apple?

308
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,333
- Will you buy me one?
- You want candy or caramel?

309
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,667
I should have run away
and become a carny.

310
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,792
You are a carny.

311
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,333
Remember the other night
in the kitchen?

312
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,000
When I said, "-"?

313
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,458
Yeah.

314
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,458
As in, "...

315
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,458
<i>you just met your wife."</i>

316
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,542
I'm just gonna
give you some...

317
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,458
Well, look who it is.

318
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,958
Can't seem
to get away from you.

319
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,333
Yeah, I was gonna
walk on by,

320
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,625
but he wanted to say hello

321
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,583
and meet
the new doctor and...

322
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,625
Well, I'm not technically
a doctor yet,

323
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,833
but it is a pleasure,
Mr. Monkey.

324
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,542
- Hello!
- Hello!

325
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,875
Turns out
you were right.

326
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,875
We do need tickets
for the bigger rides.

327
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,333
- Hi.
- Hey.

328
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,333
Ryan, this is Travis.

329
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,625
He's my vet.

330
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,958
And, Travis, this is Ryan
McCarthy, my boyfriend.

331
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,458
Nice to meet you, Ryan.

332
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,708
Hey, you want to ride
that rusty old Cyclone?

333
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,000
I heard it only killed
four people this year.

334
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,708
- Hi.
- Hey.

335
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,667
Monica,
this is Gabby and Ryan.

336
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,917
- And this is Monica.
- Hi.

337
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,125
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

338
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,458
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

339
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,333
<i>- Hello.
- How are you?</i>

340
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,125
- You're the vet here in Wrightsville.
- That's right.

341
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,667
My father's been
going there for years.

342
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,958
I see the resemblance.

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,542
Dr. McCarthy.
He's got two pugs.

344
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:39,083
- That's right.
- Yeah, he does.

345
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,917
All right, folks.

346
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,792
We're going to let some
rusty carnival ride maim us.

347
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,083
- So...
- Fun.

348
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,875
...y'all have a good night.

349
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,000
- Ryan, it was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you guys.

350
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:49,458
- Bye.
- Bye.

351
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,917
Gabby, see you back
at the ranch.

352
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,833
He's... he's also
my neighbor.

353
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,583
Yeah. I know.

354
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,458
Should we go
on those bumper cars?

355
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,833
- Yes.
- Let's do it, right?

356
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,792
Let's go.
Come on.

357
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,500
Hey!

358
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:35,708
Hey, girl.

359
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,958
<i>Made you something.</i>

360
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,958
Don't work too hard.

361
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,417
What the hell
you looking at?

362
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,625
<i>- Hi.
- Hey, hey!</i>

363
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,083
- Really?
- Yeah.

364
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,333
<i>Is this how
you hold it, honey?</i>

365
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,750
<i>Yeah, sweetie.
You got it.</i>

366
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,667
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

367
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,875
What in the world?

368
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,542
That's my girl. Whoo!

369
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,792
I do believe
we've been hustled.

370
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,333
Speak for yourself.

371
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,125
I knew she was
holding back 'cause...

372
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:40,625
<i>Look at her.
She's got that look.</i>

373
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay, I'll come clean.

374
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,458
I've actually been playing
since I was nine.

375
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,875
I told you.

376
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,833
We had three holes on the
property where I grew up

377
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,000
with a water hazard.

378
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,458
With a water hazard, see?

379
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,458
- Gracious.
- I got kind of good.

380
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,750
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

381
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't you have
a flight to catch, doctor?

382
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,750
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

383
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,417
Can't somebody else go
supervise the Atlanta opening?

384
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,625
Who would you suggest,
Maryanne?

385
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,333
After all,
our name is on the door.

386
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,333
I just have to go
shake a few hands.

387
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,667
Make sure the ship
is sailing straight.

388
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,875
<i>Be back in a few weeks.</i>

389
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,875
- I know.
- You better stay away

390
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,625
from all those
pretty interns, hear?

391
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,875
You remember that one
back up in Charleston

392
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,625
that couldn't keep
her hands off of you?

393
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,625
Sure do. I'm going to
marry her one day.

394
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,750
Really?

395
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,458
Well, who knows?
Two or three years,

396
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,000
maybe Gabby and Ryan
will be opening

397
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,625
that Savannah
facility together.

398
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,500
- I should get going.
- Look at that time!

399
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,792
See, I knew
that would do it.

400
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,542
Thanks.

401
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,875
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

402
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:54,000
So, seems like
you and Monica

403
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,875
are picking up right where
you left off?

404
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,333
Don't make a thing
out of it.

405
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,625
I'm not making
a thing out of it.

406
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,750
- You are.
- I'm just saying,

407
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,625
seems like maybe she's
sticking around this time.

408
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,458
I'm sure you know she rented
a place on the mainland,

409
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,875
but did you know she planted
herself a vegetable garden?

410
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,792
- Did she now?
- Ordered cable.

411
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,083
Premium cable.

412
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,792
That means something.

413
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,750
It means she can eat a salad
and watch Animal Planet.

414
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,083
What are you busting
my chops about this?

415
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:27,625
I feel like if anybody'd
be into it, it'd be you.

416
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,542
Hey, I love Monica.

417
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,792
If y'all ended up together,

418
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,333
I'd be totally happy.

419
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,083
But?

420
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,875
I know you.

421
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,458
What's that
supposed to mean?

422
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,667
Remember what Mommy used
to say about opportunity?

423
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,667
She said opportunity
is missed by most people

424
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,958
because it's
dressed up in overalls

425
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,458
and it looks
a lot like work.

426
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,417
No, Thomas Edison
said that, not Mama.

427
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,625
And I thought you
were in grad school.

428
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,417
Shut up.

429
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,667
I'm just saying
maybe instead of overalls,

430
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,792
your opportunity is dressed
up in green hospital scrubs

431
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,792
and lives about 100 feet
from your back door.

432
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,083
But it is work,

433
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,958
and my big brother
does not like it

434
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,542
when things
don't come easy.

435
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,625
How dare you?

436
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,667
I ought to squirt you
in the eye with this lemon.

437
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,458
- Drop it.
- Don't.

438
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,875
No. You won't.

439
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:32,000
Hi. Can you...
Can you open?

440
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,042
Puppies!

441
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,333
You're half dressed.

442
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,958
You're naked.

443
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,000
But puppies.
Thank you.

444
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,667
Sorry. Something's wrong.
She's in pain.

445
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,750
- Gabby?
- Yeah?

446
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,333
We're all good now.

447
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,000
She's been asking for you.
Come on.

448
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:06,458
She was crying
and vomiting.

449
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,625
She had a uterine prolapse.

450
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,958
I knew
something was wrong.

451
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,542
You were in
so much pain.

452
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,833
Hey, Molly.
You're a mama.

453
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:21,125
What am I going to do
with all you guys?

454
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,958
Whatever you do,
don't name them.

455
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,958
Makes it harder
to put them up for adoption.

456
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,458
- Okay.
- And you should probably build them a pen.

457
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,458
I'd be happy to help you,
if you'd like.

458
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,000
I mean,
unless Ryan wants to.

459
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:38,542
No. He's out of town
for a few weeks.

460
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,458
But I am a handy gal,
so I can figure it out.

461
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,458
Well,
I should probably

462
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,458
take her in
to monitor her.

463
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,708
What? To the clinic?

464
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,833
- Now?
- Yeah.

465
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,125
<i>But it's 2:00 AM.</i>

466
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,750
It's 3:00 AM.

467
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,708
I thought you just said
she was okay.

468
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,125
Hang on. I did.
She's doing good.

469
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,750
It's just a precaution.

470
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,792
Is that necessary?

471
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,458
Well, most
precautions aren't.

472
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,875
It's why we call them
precautions.

473
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,708
You're being smug.

474
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,000
No, no.
I'm being honest.

475
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,958
That's smug.
You're so smug!

476
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,708
Good Lord,
you bother me to no end.

477
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,958
Wait. Where will you sleep?

478
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm not going to sleep.

479
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,792
I'm like an owl.

480
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,333
They're gonna be
all right.

481
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,958
Thank you, Travis.

482
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,625
I think that's the first
time you said my name.

483
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,833
I like it.

484
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,375
Good night.

485
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:44,792
Good night.
Good night.

486
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:45,958
Okay.

487
00:22:58,417 --> 00:22:59,708
Must be pretty.

488
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,625
If you see a man
sleeping on a cold floor,

489
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,958
there's sure to be
a beautiful woman nearby.

490
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,625
Well, Miss Alice,

491
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,458
I hear
John Cougar Mellencamp

492
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,625
is scratching himself
something terrible.

493
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,458
Why don't you come on back?
We'll take a look-see.

494
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,750
Okay.

495
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:27,875
But Shep knows him so well,
I don't mind waiting.

496
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah. We're all full up today.

497
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,458
Shep's busy, so you're just
going to have to deal with me.

498
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,583
Come on back.
Come on, bud!

499
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,333
- Back on your right.
- Okay.

500
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,667
Come on. Yeah!

501
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:43,667
- Hey!
- Hi.

502
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:47,625
If I were you, I'd build a pen in
either the garage or the laundry.

503
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,667
And for God's sake,
don't give them names.

504
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,583
You and Travis have
exactly the same shtick.

505
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,458
You know that?

506
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,667
Yeah, well, I don't know
whether he gets it from me

507
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,417
or I get it
from him sometimes.

508
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,750
There's nothing cuter
than puppies in a basket.

509
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,875
Got the goods, Doc.

510
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,875
- Good.
- Can we trust her?

511
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, come on. Let's not
make a thing out of it.

512
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,542
What the hell you doing?

513
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,958
What's it look like?

514
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,667
Well, it looks like
you're swapping out

515
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,458
a dead lizard
for a live lizard.

516
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,625
Yeah, that's right.

517
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,625
Is that for that
little girl out there?

518
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,958
Yeah.

519
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,417
Don't you think
there's a little more

520
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,708
ethical solution here?

521
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,125
Well, what
do you suggest, CPR?

522
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,000
You know, like,
the truth, doctor?

523
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:31,542
The truth?

524
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,750
You want to go and tell
that sweet little girl

525
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,792
that her pet lizard is dead?

526
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,708
She's ten years old. She doesn't
even know what death is.

527
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,958
<i>You want to explain
death to her?</i>

528
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,083
<i>You may as well tell her that
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny</i>

529
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,875
<i>don't exist
while you're at it.</i>

530
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,542
I don't think you should
make a habit of it,

531
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,625
but if you get a chance
to protect a kid

532
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:52,667
from the heartbreak that this
world doles out so generously,

533
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,708
I think you should seize it.

534
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,417
Because there's lots more
where that came from.

535
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,792
Okay.
I want you to take this

536
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,542
and tell her
that Abracadabra

537
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,667
has made
a miraculous recovery

538
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:07,958
and is ready to go home.

539
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,917
Me? You want me to do it?

540
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,750
Yes, because I want you
to get used to this situation.

541
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,833
Unh.

542
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,875
Now go. Go.

543
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:28,000
He's going to be okay.

544
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:34,458
Now, Taylor,

545
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,000
I have something very
important to tell you,

546
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,542
okay, honey?

547
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,958
Go on.

548
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,542
Abracadabra!

549
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:52,458
There he is!

550
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,000
It is a miracle.

551
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,750
He's all better now.

552
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,875
Boat day! Hey!

553
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:03,458
Look, guys,
we promised the kids

554
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,958
we'd be home for popcorn
and monster movies.

555
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,542
<i>So let's get this
show on the road.</i>

556
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,833
Okay, I'm letting
y'all know right now

557
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,833
that I am hungover
and altogether irritable.

558
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,458
So don't expect nothing more

559
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,875
than a sunburn
out of me today.

560
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,042
<i>Would you do me a favor?</i>

561
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,417
What?

562
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,583
Would you clean those steamy,

563
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,792
slimy fish guts
out of that nasty,

564
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:21,958
<i>bloody bucket?</i>

565
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,542
<i>And maybe after that,</i>

566
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,458
you can drain the grease
trap on the barbeque?

567
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,958
And make sure you get
all the chunks of fat

568
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,583
<i>or you're going to have
a maggot problem.</i>

569
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,125
If y'all make me puke,

570
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,708
I'm going to save it,

571
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,458
put it in
little plastic bags,

572
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,792
put it on
your pillows tonight.

573
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,458
Believe it or not,
she's single, folks!

574
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,708
<i>Hey, where's Monica at?</i>

575
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,333
Monica's sitting
this one out.

576
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,500
You don't say?

577
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,833
I can invite
whoever I want.

578
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,583
- It's my boat.
- It is his boat.

579
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:48,458
<i>- It's our day!
- It's our day.</i>

580
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,583
Be nice.

581
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,583
You know how
to pick 'em, Trav.

582
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,708
<i>You've got an air
of authority</i>

583
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,833
<i>and dignity
as the captain today.</i>

584
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,375
- You like that?
- Yeah.

585
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:01,792
Well, I'm borrowing
his ship today.

586
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,333
Yeah, it's new.

587
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:06,000
<i>You seem awfully focused.</i>

588
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,958
I'm driving,
so I can't drink.

589
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,542
She's making me
nervous as hell.

590
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:11,917
<i>Woe is you.</i>

591
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:13,917
Hey, y'all, this is not
a middle school dance.

592
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,625
Go bother
somebody else.

593
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:16,792
Hey, you doing all right?

594
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:19,042
Hey. Yeah, I am great.

595
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,500
Not getting seasick
on us, are you?

596
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,792
- No.
- Good.

597
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,792
This is unbelievable.

598
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,042
It's great.

599
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,792
I can't even believe
you get to come here

600
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:28,000
all the time
and do this.

601
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,375
Hey, mind if we join you?

602
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:33,042
<i>- Hi.
- It's so hot.</i>

603
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,958
<i>It's 80 degrees. Take off that sweatshirt.
Are you crazy?</i>

604
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,917
Okay. Okay.

605
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,625
- It's hot.
- It's the Spanish Inquisition.

606
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,125
You can lay off.

607
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,292
We might be
in trouble, boy.

608
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,458
You can do it.
You're so close.

609
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,708
- Come on, Moby.
- You can do it.

610
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,542
You're going to make it!

611
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,083
Someone needs to teach
that dog how to swim.

612
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,500
- Cooked to perfection.
- All right, thank you, sir.

613
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:03,833
Thank you, sir.

614
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,625
Don't even
think about it.

615
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:10,667
I saw that before.

616
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:11,958
It's happy.
It's a happy color.

617
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,375
Well, to good times.

618
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:17,625
<i>Mattie and Ben have a pretty
successful loan company.</i>

619
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:20,042
<i>But I keep thinking
Mattie wants out,</i>

620
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,583
<i>like he feels like his life is
passing him by or something.</i>

621
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,375
What do you think?

622
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,792
None of my business.

623
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,750
I'm not one to gossip.

624
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,375
What about that guy?

625
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:34,667
That guy?

626
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,000
<i>My knucklehead brother?</i>

627
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:38,458
I don't know.
You tell me.

628
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:41,500
Well, he is the glue.

629
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:46,792
The good old boy who's mastered
the art of Southern charm.

630
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,000
Women give him
anything he wants.

631
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:50,333
Anything.

632
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,708
He gives them just...
Just enough

633
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,917
to keep them coming back

634
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:55,042
and has never been in love

635
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:59,375
because he backs off
when things get too hard.

636
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:02,042
That's why
he has that chair.

637
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,500
You know, the chair out in
the front of his house.

638
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,792
That lonely chair.

639
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:11,333
Well, it is just one chair.

640
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,792
The man with one chair
likes to sit alone.

641
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,333
You know, I sure like
talking to you.

642
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,542
Pass it!

643
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,333
- Yeah!
- Nice.

644
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:32,333
You are in so much more
trouble than I thought.

645
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,333
<i>Hey, over here!
Pass it!</i>

646
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:02,333
<i>Is this seat taken?</i>

647
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,917
No, it is not.
Go ahead.

648
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,458
Yeah.

649
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,667
Yeah.

650
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,625
- Hello.
- Hello yourself.

651
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,792
Hey,
I have a confession.

652
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,500
Okay.

653
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:21,875
My friends like you
better than they like me.

654
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,792
Yeah, yeah.

655
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,417
I was actually afraid
that was going to happen.

656
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,625
I just don't get it.

657
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,458
- Yeah.
- I don't get it.

658
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,917
I mean, you're not
funny, you're not smart.

659
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,083
You're nothing to look at.

660
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,625
No. I think it's...

661
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,417
It speaks a little more
to, you know, you,

662
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,792
and you're just...

663
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:42,458
You feel quite mediocre
and really unattractive.

664
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,667
I'm lowering the bar.

665
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,917
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

666
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,083
That's it. That's why.

667
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,500
So they can tolerate you.

668
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:48,667
Yeah, I thought so.

669
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:49,792
That makes sense.

670
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,542
Yeah.

671
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,750
I love it here.

672
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,542
Thanks for coming.

673
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:03,917
I'm really glad you came.

674
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:08,083
Yeah, me, too.

675
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,625
I feel really good out here.

676
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,542
I haven't felt
like that in a while.

677
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,958
- That's good.
- Yeah.

678
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,750
- You dork.
- You're a dork.

679
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,708
You keep looking at me.

680
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,333
Son of a...

681
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,083
You look...

682
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:45,458
Well, good night.

683
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:48,875
I noticed you didn't eat
a lot out there today.

684
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:52,458
What do you say we throw
some red meat on the grill,

685
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,792
tell a few lies?

686
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Has anyone ever
said no to you before?

687
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,875
"No"?

688
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,625
<i>No. I thought so.</i>

689
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,625
I am making history,

690
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,333
Good night.

691
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,667
There you go again
bothering me.

692
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,958
She said no to us, Stink.

693
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,125
Yeah, I know.

694
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:28,083
I'm not familiar
with that term either.

695
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,375
Come on.

696
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,750
If you've been
in the fish guts again...

697
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,292
Hey.

698
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:26,958
What you got?

699
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:42,708
Good boy.

700
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:45,750
Come on, boy.
Come on!

701
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,833
- Hi.
- Hi.

702
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:01,000
- I brought wine.
- Thank you.

703
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,292
Thank you.

704
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,917
Handy, my ass.

705
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,625
Well, the young 'uns
are looking good.

706
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,875
I think they're down
for the night.

707
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:33,333
Good.

708
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,375
Damn, I thought you were just
going to whip something up.

709
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,625
I am.

710
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,458
If this is how you whip,

711
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,083
I might just have to get
down on one knee right now.

712
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,458
Excuse me?

713
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,458
My mama is an amazing cook.

714
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,458
I just paid attention.

715
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,833
Hang on a minute.
Is this you right here?

716
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:50,000
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

717
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:51,458
It's my favorite memory.

718
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,333
It's at the property
where we grew up.

719
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:58,458
We used to swim
and ride bikes and fish,

720
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,750
and I used to put on
these silly little plays.

721
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,333
My dad would tell me
stories at nighttime

722
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,875
<i>about the constellations.</i>

723
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,708
They sound like good folks.

724
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,417
Yeah, they are.

725
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,875
A hurricane washed it all
away, though, when I was 12.

726
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:16,333
<i>Broke my heart.</i>

727
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,667
It's funny, I wonder if that's
why that's my favorite memory.

728
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,417
What do you mean?

729
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:23,542
<i>When things go away,
you know?</i>

730
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,417
Makes you appreciate
them so much more

731
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,958
than when you
actually have them.

732
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,667
Yeah.

733
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:30,958
It makes you pay attention
to the things

734
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:33,667
that are just
right in front of you.

735
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,083
Okay, dinner is served

736
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,458
on the eastern-most
botanical mezzanine.

737
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,125
So the porch
with the trumpet weeds?

738
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,417
Exactly!

739
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,000
<i>Beautiful.</i>

740
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,458
I'm sorry.

741
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:04,625
This view we got here
is just beautiful.

742
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,333
<i>Yes. The view.</i>

743
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:15,083
I really can't
get enough of it.

744
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,333
Yeah.

745
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,958
It is really something.

746
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,958
It makes you wonder where it
all comes from, doesn't it?

747
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:28,875
Not really.

748
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,458
Not really?

749
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,333
- No.
- Okay.

750
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,333
So you don't
believe in God.

751
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,000
<i>- Boy.
- Boy!</i>

752
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,542
This was going so good.

753
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,125
<i>"Boy"?
Don't "boy" me.</i>

754
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:47,667
An honest question
deserves an honest answer.

755
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,000
All right.

756
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,458
- I apologize.
- Okay.

757
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:53,708
So?

758
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,458
You want to know
what I believe in?

759
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,667
Yeah.

760
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,333
Moby, come here.

761
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,458
<i>He has an opinion
on this, does he?</i>

762
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,083
Yeah.
Watch this.

763
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,042
Now, you see that?

764
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,333
How he pushes back?

765
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,792
<i>He does it every time,</i>

766
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,042
and he only does it for me.

767
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,833
Now, that's loyalty.

768
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,833
I know it sounds stupid,

769
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:24,375
but it's love.

770
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,625
Your friends,
your family, yourself.

771
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,833
That's all you can count on
in this world.

772
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,375
And that's what I believe.

773
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,792
What do you believe?

774
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,833
I believe...

775
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:53,833
in the moon,

776
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,750
the stars.

777
00:37:56,792 --> 00:38:00,958
<i>It's that feeling</i>

778
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,458
<i>that I'm a part
of something</i>

779
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,708
<i>so much bigger
than myself</i>

780
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,042
that I will never,
ever begin to understand.

781
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,833
And it's something
that I cannot control,

782
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,792
no matter how hard I try.

783
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,958
So, if you can tell me
where that comes from

784
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,792
<i>and why it is
so damn beautiful...</i>

785
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:42,083
then I will stop saying
my prayers before bedtime.

786
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,667
- Okay.
- Okay.

787
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,542
Well, that was lovely.

788
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:52,708
<i>It was, wasn't it?</i>

789
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,958
We just had
the God conversation

790
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,125
and it wasn't bad at all.

791
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,125
It didn't go that bad.
Weird.

792
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,542
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

793
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,958
The couple that
used to live here,

794
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,458
they used to have music playing
all day and all night.

795
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,792
You'd see them
out in the grass

796
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:13,917
dancing together
on their anniversary.

797
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:18,917
<i>My God.
That is so lovely.</i>

798
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,917
<i>What happened to them?</i>

799
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,583
They're still around.

800
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:24,917
They just got
old and fragile

801
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:29,417
and moved into the home
over on Cedar and Marsh.

802
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,792
<i>- Together?
- Yeah.</i>

803
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:35,917
I love that story.

804
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,042
You're from Charleston, right?

805
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:47,750
<i>Yeah.
I miss it so much.</i>

806
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,917
All she needs now
is a silver spoon.

807
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,625
Scratch that.

808
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

809
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:12,958
Did you just spin?

810
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,875
No.

811
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,875
I know a spin
when I see one.

812
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,458
I'm pretty sure
I just saw you spin.

813
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,958
You know, I...
Maybe there was a twirl.

814
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,083
Twirl?

815
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,042
Yeah.

816
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,625
You wash, I'll dry.

817
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,333
No. Here.
I will get it.

818
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,792
- Come on.
- No, I'm good.

819
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,875
All right, well,

820
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:40,042
you want to dance with me
out on the grass?

821
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:43,083
No.

822
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,083
Why do you make it so hard
for me to flirt with you?

823
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:48,083
Because if I made it easy,
you wouldn't flirt anymore.

824
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:52,958
I shouldn't have said that.

825
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,667
What are you doing?

826
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,333
I'm walking
towards you real slow.

827
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:15,958
Why?

828
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,792
Because if I ran,
I'd scare you.

829
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,083
You're so smug.

830
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:28,000
Sometimes I just want
to stomp on your foot.

831
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:32,417
I knew from the moment I saw
you that you're trouble.

832
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,542
And don't think I haven't
seen you watching me

833
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,667
from your stupid ch...

834
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:47,083
Why did you do that?

835
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,875
'Cause you bother me.

836
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,833
Hey.

837
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,583
<i>"Didn't want to wake you.</i>

838
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,750
<i>Had to get
my exhausted butt to work.</i>

839
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,458
<i>Don't go far, Gabby.</i>

840
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,958
<i>This is just starting
to get good.</i>

841
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,708
<i>This is Travis,
by the way...</i>

842
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,917
<i>Your neighbor."</i>

843
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,625
Come on, come on.

844
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,833
<i>Hey, babe, it's me.</i>

845
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,417
<i>Sorry for calling so late,</i>

846
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:10,375
<i>but the opening
is going great.</i>

847
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,375
<i>These guys keep dragging me
out to dinner and drinks.</i>

848
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,917
<i>Listen, I'm trying to get
back as soon as I can,</i>

849
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,625
<i>but I still have
a lot of work to do.</i>

850
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:18,042
<i>I'm hoping that
your studying is going okay.</i>

851
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,458
<i>Love you.</i>

852
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:25,917
Maybe you should send him
to bed a little early.

853
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,500
- He's just fine.
- No limp, then?

854
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,833
No, no, no. He's... I don't
know what he's doing.

855
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:32,792
<i>- He's not limping.
- Thank you so much.</i>

856
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:34,375
<i>- All right, okay.
- Bye-bye.</i>

857
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:35,458
<i>Bye.</i>

858
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,667
What?

859
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,500
You don't think
it's slightly strange

860
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:51,500
that John Cougar Mellencamp
is in here three times a week?

861
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,375
Well, you know
what some folks are like.

862
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:54,625
Their pets
are their children.

863
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:56,542
That dog has got to be
the healthiest animal

864
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:58,042
this side of
the Mason-Dixon.

865
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:00,375
That woman's got
something else on her mind.

866
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:02,333
Who? Mrs. Vandy?

867
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:05,042
Now, Daddy,
you know her name's Alice.

868
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:07,875
She's been divorced from Mr.
Vandy for the last three years.

869
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,458
What are you getting at?

870
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,375
- She's crushing on you!
- That's hogwash.

871
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:13,625
And frankly,
you're crushing on her.

872
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:14,958
There ain't no other patient

873
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,375
you walk all the way
to the door every time

874
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,583
just giggling
like a schoolgirl.

875
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,333
I walk her to the door

876
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:21,625
because I'm a professional
and I'm a gentleman,

877
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,417
and we're not giggling.

878
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:24,875
Stop being
such a stubborn mule

879
00:45:24,917 --> 00:45:29,542
and ask the pretty lady out
on a proper date already...

880
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,625
Doctor.

881
00:45:58,917 --> 00:46:01,625
- Son of a...
- What now, slick?

882
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,750
Well, I guess
we could just hang here.

883
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,417
It shouldn't last
very long.

884
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,792
There you go
spinning again.

885
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:17,125
I am swinging,
not spinning.

886
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:19,625
You sure do like
to argue, don't you?

887
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,417
It's because
I'm really good at it.

888
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,417
<i>- Are you now?
- Yep.</i>

889
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:27,542
Do you hear that?
Come on!

890
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,458
- Gabby...
- Come on! Hurry up!

891
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:31,833
<i>- Gabby!
- Come on!</i>

892
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,792
You got something
better to do?

893
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:38,375
Ain't no way I'm stepping
foot in that church.

894
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:39,708
I'd rather
roll in poison ivy,

895
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,875
stab rusty nails
in my eyes...

896
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:42,833
What is your deal?

897
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,375
I rode on
your motorcycle, pal.

898
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:45,500
I went in your boat.

899
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,083
Time to do
something I want.

900
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,625
There's a church closer to
town that's less packed.

901
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,875
Hurry up!

902
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,542
I think I'm going to
burst into flames.

903
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,333
Hush.

904
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,875
My God,
it's your dad!

905
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:26,417
<i>How about that?</i>

906
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,042
Special thanks
to the Wrightsville Beats

907
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,625
for that rousing rendition
of Traffic's 1969 classic,

908
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:35,875
my personal favorite,
and a real birthday treat.

909
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,708
Well, thanks for coming.
It was great to see you.

910
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:46,625
Dr. Shep!
That was amazing!

911
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:48,500
I had no idea
that you did that.

912
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,792
Well, thank you,
but you're a miracle worker.

913
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:52,083
It takes real guile

914
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,458
to get that ingrate
son of mine

915
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,625
<i>through those doors.</i>

916
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,833
All right, go ahead,
Your Holiness.

917
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:57,125
Go ahead?

918
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,625
I'm sure you got
some self-righteous barb

919
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,333
you want to stick me with,
so get it over with.

920
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,792
I don't know what you mean.

921
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,000
Gabby and I are just
talking about the weather.

922
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:04,500
Yeah.

923
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:05,917
I mean, look,
isn't it beautiful?

924
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:09,042
After all this time,
the sun hath returned.

925
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:11,625
<i>- There it is.
- There it is.</i>

926
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,625
<i>- That feel better?
- Yeah.</i>

927
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,625
<i>I got the cake.</i>

928
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:19,125
I may have taken a few bites
for safety purposes.

929
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:22,542
- Where's Dad?
- Yonder.

930
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,917
Hope you don't mind
me inviting Gabby.

931
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:27,625
I know it's always been a
tradition, just us and Dad.

932
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,583
I hate tradition.

933
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:32,958
Don't burn the steak.

934
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,375
I'm not burning
your steak.

935
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:36,917
We were lucky.

936
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:38,792
The sheriff's retriever
was a patient of mine.

937
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:41,042
Travis would have spent
the weekend in jail.

938
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,625
But I never got
the truck out of the bog.

939
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,375
It's there to this day...
Bullfrogs' motel.

940
00:48:46,417 --> 00:48:47,583
No.

941
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,625
You know, I feel bad, Shep.

942
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:53,917
If I had known
it was your birthday,

943
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,625
I would have gotten you
a present.

944
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:59,042
No,
it's not my birthday.

945
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,500
Travis didn't tell you?

946
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:04,500
No, it's Catherine's.

947
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,917
My wife. Their mom.

948
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:09,375
She'd be 57 today.

949
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,708
She had cancer,
you know?

950
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,583
First in her breasts,
and then in her bones,

951
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:19,458
and then...
Then everywhere.

952
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:24,125
Travis was 14,

953
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,708
mad at the world.

954
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,833
And I... I kind of...

955
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,958
Kind of fell
into the Bible.

956
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,750
He wanted to burn it,
you know?

957
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,708
I kind of figured
that I'd lose him

958
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,583
if I tried to make him
see it from my side,

959
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:41,792
so I didn't.

960
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,375
Maybe...

961
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,583
Maybe I should've.

962
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,375
I think he turned out
all right.

963
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:54,625
Yeah.

964
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,750
Y'all quit talking
about me and come eat!

965
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:58,833
Okay, here it comes.

966
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,458
All righty.

967
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,625
That looks amazing.

968
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,125
A good-looking
piece of cake there.

969
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,833
- Yeah.
- I know there is.

970
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,500
- Yeah, what is...
- Shut up.

971
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:07,708
...what you're looking for.

972
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,500
<i>- Yeah, okay.
- My gosh.</i>

973
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:13,708
All right.
Happy birthday.

974
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,792
Just... now, hold it
one second there, Gabby.

975
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:25,792
There is a minor tradition.

976
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:30,917
Catherine always insisted
that the birthday girl or boy

977
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:35,042
had to endure a little
ceremonial cake on the face.

978
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,625
She was a little bit
of a jokester.

979
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:40,042
- A little bit.
- Really?

980
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:43,500
Okay.
So who gets it?

981
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:45,500
Well, you are the guest.

982
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,917
Yeah, I mean,
that's only fair, right?

983
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:50,958
- Guest of honor.
- Yeah, I am the guest.

984
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,375
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

985
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:53,500
It'll be over quick.

986
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:56,500
All right, let's do it.

987
00:50:56,542 --> 00:50:58,083
I'm sorry.

988
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,500
<i>Okay.</i>

989
00:50:59,542 --> 00:51:02,042
One, two, three.

990
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,417
I got that, yeah?

991
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,875
My God!
It's up my nostril!

992
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:18,000
<i>- It's really good.
- It is?</i>

993
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:19,583
Yeah.
It's in my nose.

994
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,500
It is... you know what?
It is really tasty.

995
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,458
Give me that!
Come on!

996
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,667
Out of there!
Out of there!

997
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:30,542
Okay.

998
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,542
Thank you.

999
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:34,708
- Hang in there, Daddy.
- Thank you.

1000
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,000
- Love you.
- Good night.

1001
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:40,458
Are you really going to let
him drive home like that?

1002
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,000
He's not driving anywhere.

1003
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah, he's just going
to say good night to Mama.

1004
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:47,333
She's just up
the road a ways.

1005
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:51,000
I'll check in on him
in a few shakes.

1006
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:53,000
- Good night, lovely.
- Good night.

1007
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:55,000
- So glad you're here.
- That was so much fun.

1008
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:56,875
Thank you...
For the cake.

1009
00:51:56,917 --> 00:51:58,583
Thanks for that,
yeah.

1010
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:00,458
- I love you, dipshit.
- Yeah, I love you.

1011
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,875
<i>- Good night.
- Stephanie: Night, y'all.</i>

1012
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:05,083
<i>I should get started
on the dishes.</i>

1013
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,458
You should not.

1014
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,792
It's my house,
my dishes.

1015
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,000
It'll take me
two and a half shakes.

1016
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:01,417
Yeah. Hi,
bud.

1017
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:04,458
<i>Yeah. Yeah!</i>

1018
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:18,042
There's something
I want to show you.

1019
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,458
Okay.

1020
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,042
Okay.

1021
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:26,667
All right, so what
I'm about to show you,

1022
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,042
I've never shown anybody.

1023
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,917
So you can't
tell a soul, all right?

1024
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,000
Okay.

1025
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:37,833
Yeah.

1026
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:42,292
All right.

1027
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,500
- Okay.
- Watch it.

1028
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:31,750
Welcome to my island.

1029
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:33,750
Your island?

1030
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:34,917
Yeah.

1031
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,708
My grandfather and I

1032
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,375
used to come out
here and fish.

1033
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:42,042
He left it to me
when he passed on.

1034
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,375
This is where I come
when I want to be alone.

1035
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,458
And...
I don't know.

1036
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,583
I wanted
to show it to you.

1037
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:01,375
It's unbelievable.

1038
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,500
This is my favorite part.

1039
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,292
Look.

1040
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:17,000
From me to you, Gabby.

1041
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:19,458
The stars and the moon.

1042
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:32,292
Let's just stay
here forever.

1043
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:46,917
I'm glad you like it.

1044
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,292
Yeah.

1045
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:52,333
I do.

1046
00:55:53,792 --> 00:55:55,917
Very much.

1047
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:07,042
I think John Cougar might be a
little bit of a hypochondriac.

1048
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:09,750
I wouldn't worry about him,
Mrs. Vandy.

1049
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:11,625
It's Alice, please.

1050
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:14,625
Alice, yes.

1051
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:17,125
Well, thanks again,
Dr. Shep.

1052
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,500
Well, you're welcome.

1053
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:22,000
Here, let me,
get the door.

1054
00:56:22,042 --> 00:56:23,750
So I'll see you
next time?

1055
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:25,667
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

1056
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:42,333
Mrs. Vandy?

1057
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,000
Alice?

1058
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:46,750
I was thinking,

1059
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:49,917
maybe we could have
dinner sometime?

1060
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:54,000
Yes. I would like that.

1061
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:56,333
Yes, well, so would I.

1062
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:59,958
- Well, okay. Bye.
- Bye.

1063
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:31,333
Earth to Gabby.

1064
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:32,458
Don't you hear
the intercom?

1065
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:33,500
I've been paging you.

1066
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:38,417
Phone call. Line one.

1067
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,625
- For me?
- Yeah.

1068
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:49,500
<i>Hello? Hey, babe. How are you?</i>

1069
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:50,792
Hi.

1070
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:51,958
<i>I know I should
have called earlier,</i>

1071
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:54,083
<i>- but I just got back.
- Yeah.</i>

1072
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,667
<i>Meet me at Dockside.
At 7?</i>

1073
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,625
<i>My parents will be there.</i>

1074
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:16,417
- Gabby. Hi!
- Hi.

1075
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,958
How are you?

1076
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:21,917
- I missed you.
- Yeah, me, too.

1077
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,083
Come on,
my parents are over here.

1078
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,458
Let's go.

1079
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:25,958
<i>Okay.</i>

1080
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,000
<i>Hey, look.
Here they are.</i>

1081
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:38,542
Come over here
and give me a hug.

1082
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:39,750
Good to see you.

1083
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:41,458
Good to see you.
Sit down!

1084
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:43,458
- She looks gorgeous.
- This place is so much fun.

1085
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,333
Caught you off guard.

1086
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,625
<i>I don't know why we've
never been here before.</i>

1087
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:47,958
I'm sorry. I should
have called sooner.

1088
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,333
Things just wrapped up
quicker than I thought.

1089
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,542
No, it was
a nice surprise.

1090
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,708
Evening, folks.

1091
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,083
<i>Travis!</i>

1092
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,000
<i>- How the hell are you?
- Nice to see you.</i>

1093
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:57,083
<i>Mary, you remember Shep's
son Travis, don't you?</i>

1094
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,500
So you're the one
I should thank

1095
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:00,792
for fixing Cotton's eye
last month.

1096
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:02,083
<i>Ryan, did Daddy tell you</i>

1097
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,500
<i>Cotton Blossom
got stung by a bee?</i>

1098
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:07,083
<i>His poor little eye swelled
up the size of a walnut.</i>

1099
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,792
<i>Travis, why don't you
pull up a chair and join us?</i>

1100
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,958
Ryan just got back in town,
and we decided

1101
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,375
<i>we were going to
slum out here</i>

1102
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:13,917
<i>in Wrightsville
in his honor.</i>

1103
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,792
Thank you, Doc. I'd like to,
but I got an early morning,

1104
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:18,792
and I just wanted
to say hello.

1105
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:20,458
Ryan. Gabby.

1106
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,375
Good night, y'all.

1107
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:25,625
Good night.

1108
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:27,500
Nice young fella there.

1109
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,625
<i>He certainly is my hero.</i>

1110
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,500
<i>So, tell me,</i>

1111
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:32,792
<i>how was the opening
in Atlanta?</i>

1112
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:34,333
A huge success.

1113
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,667
Really good
that I went.

1114
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:37,500
<i>Meet Dr. Stevenson?</i>

1115
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:39,292
<i>- Yep.
- Would you excuse me a minute?</i>

1116
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:42,042
I'll be just a minute.

1117
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,958
Where you going?
Gabby?

1118
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,583
Travis?

1119
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:51,458
Are you going to tell him?

1120
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,625
- Please listen to me.
- Are you going to tell him?

1121
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:55,667
- I didn't know he was coming...
- Are you going to tell him?

1122
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:57,792
I don't know!

1123
00:59:57,792 --> 00:59:59,000
I don't know.

1124
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:01,625
I get it.

1125
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:02,958
So it's all right
to fool around

1126
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,583
in the back seat
with a country boy,

1127
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:06,500
but as soon
as summer camp's over,

1128
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:08,625
rich girls go home to their
rich boyfriends, is that it?

1129
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:10,708
How dare you?

1130
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,083
You don't know anything
about my life.

1131
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:13,458
I know enough.

1132
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,125
Really?

1133
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:18,125
Well, guess what, I know
about you, too, country boy.

1134
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:20,500
You see something you like
and you go after it.

1135
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:22,042
You're damn right I do.

1136
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,750
Not because you want to,
not because you need it...

1137
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:24,917
Because you just
want to win.

1138
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:27,625
I want you.

1139
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,958
We never talked about
what this was.

1140
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,792
It just happened so fast.
We got caught up.

1141
01:00:34,792 --> 01:00:37,458
Caught up? Is that what happened?
We got caught...

1142
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
We both knew this was
coming around the corner.

1143
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:40,958
Neither of us
wanted to acknowledge it.

1144
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,958
All right. All right,
well, here it is.

1145
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,125
It's right here,
right in front of us.

1146
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,917
So let's acknowledge it.

1147
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:50,458
We had an amazing time.

1148
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:54,125
One of those ground-shaking,
life-altering,

1149
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,708
knock you
on your ass months,

1150
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,708
and I wish it could be more.

1151
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,583
But this is...
This is all I get.

1152
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:04,750
So what about you?

1153
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:07,583
No.

1154
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,917
No, see,
that is not fair.

1155
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,625
How am I supposed
to know how you feel?

1156
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:13,042
I love you.

1157
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:15,000
You hear me?
I love you.

1158
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:16,083
I'll say it again.
I love you.

1159
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,542
I'll say it
a million times.

1160
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,500
I love you,
I love you, I love you.

1161
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:22,500
I knew it the second
you walked into my yard

1162
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:23,792
ready to rip me a new one.

1163
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:27,042
Hell, my damn dog knew it.

1164
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,792
Now, do you remember what you
said to me on my island,

1165
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:33,792
holding my hand
under the stars?

1166
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:35,708
You said,
"Let's stay here forever."

1167
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:40,375
Well, we can.

1168
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,708
Me and you.

1169
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:45,583
Come home with me.

1170
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,458
Come home.

1171
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:54,042
We'll go in there together
and we'll tell them...

1172
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:56,333
together.

1173
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,708
That is what you want,
isn't it?

1174
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:06,958
Isn't it?

1175
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:23,958
I don't know.

1176
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,625
- All right.
- No.

1177
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:32,792
- All right.
- No.

1178
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:34,667
All right.

1179
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:03,458
<i>"Dear Travis,</i>

1180
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,417
<i>I feel like such a coward
writing this letter.</i>

1181
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:11,708
<i>After you left,
I told Ryan everything.</i>

1182
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,083
<i>He yelled and cussed.</i>

1183
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:17,750
<i>He called me just about
every name in the book.</i>

1184
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:20,625
<i>He stormed out
and told me to go to hell."</i>

1185
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:33,667
<i>But in the morning,
he came back</i>

1186
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:35,333
<i>and he asked me
to marry him."</i>

1187
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:43,958
<i>Got to thinking that life is
held together by choices,</i>

1188
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:45,667
<i>one after the other."</i>

1189
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:48,958
So cute!

1190
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:52,667
<i>"All shapes and sizes."</i>

1191
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:53,958
So cute.

1192
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,375
<i>"Right or wrong
doesn't matter,</i>

1193
01:03:56,417 --> 01:03:59,458
<i>because life
just keeps unfolding.</i>

1194
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,833
<i>It won't wait around
for you.</i>

1195
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:07,333
<i>If you sit still, it could

1196
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:14,083
- Happy anniversary!
- Ten years!

1197
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:21,958
Hi.

1198
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,917
Hi.

1199
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:25,625
<i>"I guess I'd like

1205
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,375
Here you go.

1206
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:43,458
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

1207
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:54,500
You...

1208
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:58,375
You seem like you're
somewhere else tonight.

1209
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:01,458
I know.
I'm sorry.

1210
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:03,583
I'm just
a little wiped out.

1211
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:12,625
You'll never look at me
the way you look at her.

1212
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,833
It's true.

1213
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:20,917
I know it.

1214
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,833
I'd hate her for it
if I was one of those women,

1215
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,000
but I'm not.

1216
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:27,375
Come on, now.

1217
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:29,292
Travis, I...

1218
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:34,708
I'm going to give you
some friendly advice,

1219
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,375
and then I'm going to
go home and cry, okay?

1220
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,458
Swallow your pride.

1221
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,583
You want to be the guy
that shows up in ten years

1222
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,833
with flowers in your hand,
Moby by your side,

1223
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:50,792
hoping that
she'll hear you out?

1224
01:05:50,792 --> 01:05:53,792
Praying she'll understand
why you quit so easy?

1225
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:58,708
Because that's all
any woman wants,

1226
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,917
is a man who's
gonna fight.

1227
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,125
So why don't you
just do it now

1228
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:07,458
and save yourself
a whole decade?

1229
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:18,333
You know, she looks
at you the same way.

1230
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:25,833
Bye.

1231
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,458
Gabby! Gabby!

1232
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,042
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

1233
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,375
Gabby.
Where's Gabby?

1234
01:07:23,417 --> 01:07:25,708
- Sir?
- Gabby?

1235
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,875
- Gabby! Gabby!
- Hey, you can't...

1236
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,458
No, you need to come
back from there!

1237
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:29,625
Gabby! Gabby!

1238
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:30,792
Sir, you need
to come back!

1239
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:34,333
Shit.
You're him?

1240
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:36,042
Yeah. Gabby!

1241
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,125
Travis, she's gone.

1242
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:40,917
<i>- Where?
- I'll give you a hint.</i>

1243
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:43,333
Where do women go when they
break off their engagements?

1244
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:47,000
Now, she told me that her
head was hitting her heart.

1245
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:48,625
I'm not sure what that means,

1246
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,833
but I'm pretty sure
that you speak the language.

1247
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah.

1248
01:07:53,042 --> 01:07:57,333
I suppose that means her true
feelings were at odds with...

1249
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,625
Are you expected, sir?

1250
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:00,792
No.

1251
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:03,500
I need to see Gabby.

1252
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:10,625
This young man here is
looking for Miss Gabriella.

1253
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:13,625
Well, I believe she's
returning from the stables.

1254
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:23,500
- Hi.
- You?

1255
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:24,667
What are you doing here?

1256
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:27,417
Mr. Holland.
Mrs. Holland.

1257
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:29,458
I'm Travis Shaw.
Maybe you've heard of me?

1258
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,083
Maybe not. Okay.

1259
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,417
Well, I'm here today

1260
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:38,542
to tell you that I love
Gabby something terrible,

1261
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:40,083
and I was hoping I could
take her off your hands.

1262
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,833
- Right.
- Young man,

1263
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,708
we love Gabby
something terrible, too,

1264
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,458
but you are barking
up the wrong tree.

1265
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:50,000
If you're here
for Gabby's hand,

1266
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:51,958
you might want to ask
her parents.

1267
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,875
- No! No, no, no.
- My gosh. I'm so sorry.

1268
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:55,875
- No! No, no, no.
- I just assumed that they were...

1269
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:58,833
- It's quite all right, Travis.
- It's nice to meet you.

1270
01:09:58,833 --> 01:09:59,958
So nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

1271
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,667
Why are you here?

1272
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,042
I saw you with her
on the porch.

1273
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,417
No, hang on now.

1274
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:05,458
- On the boat.
- Hang on.

1275
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,750
- No, I saw you!
- Hang on.

1276
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:08,042
Picked up right
where you left off.

1277
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:09,792
Gabby, stop!

1278
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:13,042
Listen to me, please.

1279
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,542
I love you.

1280
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,833
Well, I don't love you.

1281
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:19,708
<i>Hush!
You do, too.</i>

1282
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:23,500
Knew it the second you walked
inside and set your eyes on him,

1283
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:25,500
biting your lip
the way you do.

1284
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:28,375
Mom! He is a walking
cautionary tale!

1285
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:30,500
- Now, hang on a minute.
- You are!

1286
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:32,042
Gabby, you've been
waiting for him to show

1287
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,625
ever since you got home
and you know it.

1288
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:34,792
Dad!

1289
01:10:34,792 --> 01:10:36,042
Whose side
are you on, anyway?

1290
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,917
Mr. Holland,
Mrs. Holland,

1291
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:40,458
I'm so sorry for the confusion
and the intrusion...

1292
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,667
Yeah!

1293
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:42,792
But I love this woman

1294
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:44,792
and I would love
a blessing from you,

1295
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:45,917
whether it's a wink
or a nod...

1296
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:47,083
My God!
A blessing?

1297
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:48,917
Or anything
that you could give me.

1298
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:50,750
You got a ring, son?

1299
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:52,792
What? What? What?
No, no, no.

1300
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:54,792
What the hell
is going on here?

1301
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:55,958
Mom? No!
No, no, no.

1302
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:57,833
I am not
marrying this man.

1303
01:10:57,875 --> 01:10:59,375
Here.

1304
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:00,500
This was her grandma's.

1305
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:02,500
What?
My God!

1306
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:04,792
Hello?
I am right here!

1307
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:06,375
- Gabby.
- No!

1308
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,792
- Gabby.
- No, no, no.

1309
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:11,708
You should probably
take a knee, son.

1310
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,958
- Dad!
- Right.

1311
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,125
- Yeah.
- Thanks again.

1312
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,917
Gabby.

1313
01:11:18,042 --> 01:11:20,458
I think I pretty much
said all the words,

1314
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,792
so all I need is a lifetime
to prove it to you.

1315
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:26,792
Will you marry me?

1316
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,333
No!

1317
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:35,917
Well, yes.

1318
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,458
No!

1319
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:38,792
- Yes!
- No!

1320
01:11:38,792 --> 01:11:39,958
- Yes!
- No!

1321
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:41,458
Yes!

1322
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,125
Come bother me, baby.

1323
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:45,792
Bother me
for the rest of my life.

1324
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,042
Be my wife.

1325
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:57,667
Okay.

1326
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,583
Don't ever let go.

1327
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:39,417
We're fighting 'em.
Come on.

1328
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:44,458
Here he comes.
He's a big one.

1329
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:48,792
No, he fell back
in the water.

1330
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:49,958
We gotta crank him back.

1331
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,458
Here's another.

1332
01:13:57,458 --> 01:14:00,375
Berry? No.

1333
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,917
There you go.

1334
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:31,417
Mine is the best.

1335
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,833
<i>Hey, handsome. So the kids
are finally in bed</i>

1336
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,750
<i>and the babysitter
arrived early,</i>

1337
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:55,042
<i>so I'm gonna head out now.</i>

1338
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:57,042
<i>And just so you know,
I'm ordering</i>

1339
01:14:57,083 --> 01:15:00,000
<i>the most expensive thing
on the menu</i>

1340
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:01,917
<i>because it's your treat.</i>

1341
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:03,417
<i>I love you.
Bye.</i>

1342
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:08,792
All right, Aurora. You're gonna
start feeling better real soon.

1343
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:10,583
It was nice to see ya.

1344
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:11,833
You be careful in the rain.

1345
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,667
- Good night.
- Thank you.

1346
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:16,375
Shoot.
I can't be late.

1347
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:18,042
- Tell me that was the last one.
- Sure was.

1348
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:20,500
- You got somewhere to be?
- Yeah, I got a date,

1349
01:15:20,542 --> 01:15:22,583
not that it's any of your
business, Miss Cora.

1350
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:26,125
A date.
Sounds romantic.

1351
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:28,500
Yeah, I've been promising Gabby
some one-on-one time

1352
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:31,625
and I stood her up on our last
date, so this one's makeup.

1353
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,417
Well, you two have fun.

1354
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:34,583
Thank you.
You have a good night.

1355
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:35,375
Good night.

1356
01:15:36,917 --> 01:15:39,958
Hi, I have reservations
for Shaw.

1357
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,500
- Follow me, please.
- Thank you.

1358
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:45,042
Have you dined
with us before?

1359
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,375
Sorry, ma'am,
we're closed.

1360
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,958
Wait, Dr. Shaw.

1361
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,917
She can't keep
anything down.

1362
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:55,458
She's so old.
Please.

1363
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,042
Well, let's do it real quick.
Right this way.

1364
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:24,625
See that?
She's got a little...

1365
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,083
Good job.
Doing good.

1366
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:29,875
Will you
hold her for me?

1367
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:31,417
Thank you.

1368
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:46,042
Can I get you
another glass of wine?

1369
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:48,958
No. No.
I'm fine, thank you.

1370
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,958
I... I'm gonna
grab the check.

1371
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,833
- Of course.
- If that's okay. Thank you.

1372
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,667
If you get this, I'm on my way.
I had a feline emergency.

1373
01:16:58,667 --> 01:17:01,625
But I'll be right there.
I am so, so sorry.

1374
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:04,500
I love you and I'll
see you in a sec.

1375
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:32,750
<i>So, like I was sayin',</i>

1376
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:37,625
<i>every path you take
leads to another choice...</i>

1377
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:41,625
<i>and some choices
could change everything.</i>

1378
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:45,792
<i>Every damn moment
for the rest of your life</i>

1379
01:18:45,792 --> 01:18:46,875
<i>hangs on it.</i>

1380
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:51,542
<i>And, boy, have I got
a choice I gotta make.</i>

1381
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,750
I do not want to
see you back here

1382
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:59,792
unless you bring your wife's cobbler, Mr.
Metcalf, you hear that?

1383
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:02,500
No more flag football.

1384
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,958
Those for someone special?

1385
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,583
Someone who deserves
the stars and the moon.

1386
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:12,917
All I got are
these damn flowers.

1387
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:14,792
- How are the girls?
- Terrible.

1388
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,833
Tess is texting already.

1389
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:18,500
Yeah.

1390
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:22,042
I'm just here
to talk to her.

1391
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:23,708
All right, you go
right ahead, Travis.

1392
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,667
If that's what you need.
If that'll help.

1393
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:30,500
Too easy on me, Ryan.

1394
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:33,583
And you're too hard
on you, Travis.

1395
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:50,042
Delphiniums.
Her favorite.

1396
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:51,625
I thought
they were lilacs.

1397
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,375
She's all yours.

1398
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:57,625
Thank you.

1399
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,458
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

1400
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,625
Got you some delphiniums.

1401
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:29,583
To be honest,
I thought they were lilacs,

1402
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:31,833
but Jackie says
they're delphiniums.

1403
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,583
I got a decision
I gotta make.

1404
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:51,458
I've been putting it off
and putting it off.

1405
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:59,333
It's, like, so much harder
than people can even imagine.

1406
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:03,625
And everybody's got
an opinion on it.

1407
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:06,833
But since yours
is the only opinion

1408
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:09,708
that I give a damn about,

1409
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,667
I just wanted
to run it past you.

1410
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,958
So here it is.

1411
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,458
What am I gonna do...

1412
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:28,375
about my pickup truck?

1413
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,958
I mean, should I get
one of those new hybrids

1414
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:33,750
that gets, like,
500 miles to the gallon

1415
01:21:33,792 --> 01:21:37,000
and runs on babies' dreams

1416
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:39,083
or should I just go ahead

1417
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:42,083
and rebuild the tranny
in Gertrude?

1418
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,917
<i>Rebuild.
All right, great.</i>

1419
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:49,917
That's what I wanted
to do anyway.

1420
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,417
You know, I always had
a special place in my heart

1421
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,708
for fossil fuels.

1422
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:59,958
I just hate breathin'
all that clean air.

1423
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:15,833
What is going on
in that head of yours?

1424
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:20,417
Come back to me, baby.

1425
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:25,625
We are runnin' out of time.

1426
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:30,958
Come bother me.

1427
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:57,042
All right, here we go.
Please. We need...

1428
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:59,375
- green.
- Green.

1429
01:22:59,417 --> 01:23:00,625
That was mine.

1430
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:03,375
<i>Where's mine?</i>

1431
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:04,792
Messed up.

1432
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:06,333
- Travis.
- Hey, Travis.

1433
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,667
Daddy.

1434
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:09,417
Who's winning?

1435
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:11,667
Well, technically speaking,
it's this pretty little girl

1436
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:13,542
here on my left,

1437
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:14,917
but since she's been
cheating since round two...

1438
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:17,042
No, I haven't!

1439
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:20,583
...I'm afraid there's gonna
be some questions about that.

1440
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:22,833
Well, I don't wanna
spoil your fun.

1441
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,500
Finish your game.

1442
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,042
- Okay.
- It's your turn.

1443
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:35,625
Okay.

1444
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:36,708
<i>Green.</i>

1445
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:51,458
Travis, I just
wanted you to know that...

1446
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:56,000
Send these off
to the lab, please.

1447
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:58,625
What do we got next?

1448
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:00,458
We've got
some friends here.

1449
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:04,375
It's gonna hurt like hell.

1450
01:24:04,417 --> 01:24:06,833
Like pain that
I can't even...

1451
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,917
Come on.

1452
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,667
<i>"'How do you play
in the river?'</i>

1453
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:32,792
<i>Tucker asked
Maggie the Mullet.</i>

1454
01:24:32,792 --> 01:24:34,500
<i>'You jump like this.</i>

1455
01:24:34,542 --> 01:24:37,792
Jump, splash,

1456
01:24:37,792 --> 01:24:39,917
jump, splash.'

1457
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,042
And Maggie was gone
in the blue river."

1458
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:47,125
Daddy, can you
do the voices?

1459
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:49,625
Mommy always
did the voices.

1460
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:53,000
Dad, why don't you
let me read it?

1461
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:59,542
Okay, big guy.
Yeah, you read it.

1462
01:24:59,583 --> 01:25:01,375
"It was beginning
to get dark,

1463
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:04,458
and Tucker spied
a big owl up in a tree.

1464
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,500
'Hi, who are you?'
Tucker asked.

1465
01:25:07,542 --> 01:25:09,417
'Who, who, who are you?

1466
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:12,917
I am Willa,
the wise old owl.'

1467
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:16,542
'What do you do when the sun
goes down?' Tucker asked."

1468
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:18,542
90 days.

1469
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:22,833
And where'd you
get that number?

1470
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,833
Medical journals
and case studies.

1471
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,500
Well, that's just
words on paper.

1472
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,833
It's statistics.

1473
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:29,917
It's well-documented,
Dr. Shep.

1474
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,792
<i>After 90 days,</i>

1475
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:33,500
the percentage
of trauma patients

1476
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:35,833
who regain consciousness

1477
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:38,375
decreases to
less than one percent.

1478
01:25:38,417 --> 01:25:40,000
<i>It's a quantifiable fact.</i>

1479
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:43,917
I'm sorry, Travis.

1480
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:45,917
<i>If we reach that mark,</i>

1481
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:48,667
we need to know you're prepared
to carry out her wishes.

1482
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,750
This is her voice.

1483
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:55,625
No, it's not.

1484
01:25:57,083 --> 01:26:00,875
That is something you do
to prepare for the future.

1485
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:05,333
For... for old age, when your
life is all behind you.

1486
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:07,375
<i>You know, you cover
for the "what ifs."</i>

1487
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:10,083
Nah. How could you know?

1488
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:13,625
How... how could you
ever really know?

1489
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:16,583
It's been a long time since
she's breathed on her own.

1490
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:19,708
Her body's tired.

1491
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,833
She's tired.

1492
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:51,833
I wish I could breathe
for you, baby.

1493
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,625
Come back to me.

1494
01:27:17,667 --> 01:27:19,333
Come home.

1495
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:22,500
I love you.

1496
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,333
All I have left
are memories.

1497
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:53,042
Trust me,
I remember everything.

1498
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:58,083
I remember
her coming home...

1499
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:00,917
day after day.

1500
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:04,125
Watching her...

1501
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:06,625
staring and thinking,

1502
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:09,833
I can't believe
that that woman

1503
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:12,750
is my wife.

1504
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:14,625
I kept thinking
how many times

1505
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:16,625
I could've told her
I loved her.

1506
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:19,792
How many times
I could've showed her,

1507
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:21,833
how many times
I could've loved her hard.

1508
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:25,500
I'd give anything
just to be with her,

1509
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:27,667
tell her one more...
One more time.

1510
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

1511
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:41,833
<i>Hi, Mama.</i>

1512
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:44,792
She's a good listener?

1513
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:46,458
She's the best.

1514
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:53,333
I had to make
a choice, Steph.

1515
01:28:56,167 --> 01:28:57,708
Just been so long.

1516
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:00,833
Seeing her like that.

1517
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,417
Knowing it's not
what she would want.

1518
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:10,750
Hell, she'd be
so mad at me.

1519
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:17,583
Last night I told her...

1520
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:20,083
today I'd do it.

1521
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:22,792
Today I would
have the strength.

1522
01:29:29,542 --> 01:29:33,333
But I just...
I just can't do it yet.

1523
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:37,083
I'm just not ready
to let her go.

1524
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,750
Me, neither.

1525
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,875
You did what
your heart told you.

1526
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:55,500
And if anybody has anything
to say about that,

1527
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,792
they gotta go through me.

1528
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:17,875
<i>...residents are advised

01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:29,667
Travis, this is crazy.
Just come with us.

1534
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:31,083
I got some
boarding up to do,

1535
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:32,625
and, besides,
I don't go anywhere

1536
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:34,833
unless its a Category 7
or higher.

1537
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:37,500
Dad, there's no such thing
as a Category 7.

1538
01:30:37,542 --> 01:30:38,833
Well, aren't you smart?

1539
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:40,583
I hope you're not
trying to prove something.

1540
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:42,625
- This thing looks big.
- There's nobody to prove it to.

1541
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:45,083
I just wanna stay
near the hospital.

1542
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:47,958
Besides, I got stink-dog
here to keep me company.

1543
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,625
Let's saddle up.

1544
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:51,458
- Come on.
- All right.

1545
01:31:00,792 --> 01:31:02,583
<i>Right now we're seeing

01:31:48,792 --> 01:31:52,458
You're a lucky SOB.
Storm landed in Charleston.

1551
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,917
Knocked it down
to a Category 2.

1552
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:59,958
Looks like the old place
could do with a lick of paint.

1553
01:32:14,792 --> 01:32:16,625
What are you looking for?

1554
01:32:16,667 --> 01:32:19,625
Something that...

1555
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:21,083
should be here.

1556
01:32:30,042 --> 01:32:33,458
<i>I let her down, Dad.</i>

1557
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:35,833
I should've been there.

1558
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,708
If I'd have been on time...

1559
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,917
It's not your fault, Travis.

1560
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:42,000
Get that out of your head.

1561
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:48,625
The world breaks
everyone, Travis.

1562
01:32:48,667 --> 01:32:51,958
The very good, the very
gentle, the very brave.

1563
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:57,667
And those it doesn't
break, it kills.

1564
01:32:57,667 --> 01:33:01,458
Is that from the good book,
Pastor Shaw?

1565
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,375
A great book.
Hemingway.

01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:09,708
There's no shame
in being a broken man.

1567
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:12,458
<i>I should know.</i>

1568
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,833
You just pick up
the pieces...

1569
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:18,083
and start rebuilding.

1570
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:17,333
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1571
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:18,875
<i>How'd you get all the
way out here, boy?</i>

1572
01:34:18,917 --> 01:34:21,000
You can't swim.

1573
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,958
What you got there, boy?

1574
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:31,708
What's that?

1575
01:34:39,917 --> 01:34:42,333
Good boy, good boy.

1576
01:34:56,542 --> 01:34:59,333
What's he doing
out there, Grandpa?

1577
01:34:59,375 --> 01:35:03,625
...just going
a little crazy.

1578
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:09,542
Come on, let's go
get some ice cream.

1579
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:12,333
Come on.

1580
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:14,917
<i>We've got vanilla,
we've got chocolate.</i>

1581
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,583
You're late.

1582
01:38:11,667 --> 01:38:13,792
I'm sorry.

1583
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:41,708
<i>Mama! Mama,
you're home!</i>

1584
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,833
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1585
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:45,667
You've seen your mom
every day this week.

1586
01:38:45,667 --> 01:38:46,917
Let's let her
get settled, okay?

1587
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:49,125
- My babies.
- Hi, Mommy.

1588
01:38:49,167 --> 01:38:52,042
Hi.

1589
01:38:52,083 --> 01:38:54,500
Let me look at you.

1590
01:38:57,458 --> 01:38:58,542
Hello, Gabby.

1591
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:02,958
Congratulations.

1592
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:05,042
Somebody
is dying to meet you.

1593
01:39:05,083 --> 01:39:07,083
Hi.

1594
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,958
My goodness.

1595
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:33,958
- Mrs. Shaw.
- Mr. Shaw.

1596
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,083
Well, welcome
to the rain-check date.

1597
01:39:38,542 --> 01:39:40,667
What is on the menu?

1598
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:43,375
Well, that's a...

1599
01:39:43,417 --> 01:39:45,500
That's a good question.

1600
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,375
The kids have been
cooking all day.

1601
01:39:47,417 --> 01:39:49,333
It, started
as a pot roast,

1602
01:39:49,375 --> 01:39:51,500
but now it's
probably a shoe.

1603
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:57,000
- I'm nervous.
- So am I.

1604
01:39:57,042 --> 01:39:59,875
...but...

1605
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:02,667
Gabby, I...

1606
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:04,083
I know I've had
a lot of time

1607
01:40:04,125 --> 01:40:05,625
to think about
what I'd say

1608
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:08,958
<i>if...
What I'd say when...</i>

1609
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:12,375
And... dang it!

1610
01:40:12,417 --> 01:40:15,542
I had this all sorted out.
I did. Now I can't...

1611
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:19,083
Travis, I heard you.

1612
01:40:21,417 --> 01:40:26,542
I heard... every word
that you said.

1613
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:32,958
You were breathing
for me, baby.

1614
01:40:37,542 --> 01:40:39,833
Your heart beat for mine.

1615
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:46,083
We got
through this together.

1616
01:40:57,125 --> 01:41:01,667
You reckon Moby had this all
planned from the get-go?

1617
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:04,083
Moby? What?

1618
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:05,958
You're gonna give Moby
all the credit?

1619
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,750
What about my sweet,
innocent Molly?

1620
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:10,542
Sweet and innocent?

1621
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:12,583
Are you saying she's
not sweet and innocent?

1622
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:13,750
- No.
- Yes.

1623
01:41:13,792 --> 01:41:16,875
- Lady.
- I know.

1624
01:41:16,917 --> 01:41:19,000
You bother me, too.

1625
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:32,625
I'm really worried
about this pot roast.

1626
01:41:32,625 --> 01:41:34,667
We're probably gonna
have to order a pizza.

1627
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:35,875
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1628
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:01,000
You guys ready?

1629
01:42:01,042 --> 01:42:04,542
One... two...
