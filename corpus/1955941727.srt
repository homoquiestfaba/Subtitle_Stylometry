1
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:59,824
Do not be afraid, my friends.
This is the only way to fly.

2
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:09,106
It'll be worth it, Scoob.
Just think, royal food tasters.

3
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:12,789
All the food we can eat,
and we get paid!

4
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:14,069
Yeah!

5
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:22,552
That'll be 14 dinar.

6
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,148
Don't worry, Scoob.
It'll be over soon.

7
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,828
- I hope.
- 14 dinar, please.

8
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:30,667
- Just whatever you do...
- 14 dinar.

9
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,153
...don't look down.

10
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:34,703
The ride is over.
14 dinar.

11
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:37,627
Over? Over!
You mean we're there?

12
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,352
And we're still alive?

13
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:41,429
I knew that.

14
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:43,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You did not.

15
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:45,910
And it's 14 dinar, please.

16
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:48,791
Come on, Scoob.
We made it.

17
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:54,350
Cut it out, Scoob.
We'll be late for our interview.

18
00:01:58,274 --> 00:01:59,627
Hey!

19
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:01,386
Oh, like, sorry.

20
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:05,109
- Like, hi!
- Yeah, hi.

21
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:08,145
We're here about the job.

22
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:11,465
- You know, royal food tasters.
- Yeah.

23
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,232
Like, after you.

24
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,432
Suckers.

25
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:23,391
Hear that, Scoob?

26
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:26,591
- Suckers for dessert!
- Yum!

27
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:33,586
So you two fellows
want to be royal food tasters.

28
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:34,869
You bet!

29
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:38,071
Do you have any previous experience
with food?

30
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:40,794
- This morning.
- Yeah, breakfast!

31
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:44,947
Well, you look like two fellows
with hearty appetites...

32
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:47,184
...and cast-iron stomachs.

33
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:49,788
- You're hired.
- All right!

34
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:54,064
We're royal food tasters!
We're royal food tasters!

35
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:57,112
Dance later. Taste food now!

36
00:02:58,674 --> 00:02:59,663
Wow!

37
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:10,547
- Like, what's this stuff?
- That is hummus tahini.

38
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:12,511
Yeah, but, like, what is it?

39
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:15,234
Mashed garbanzo beans in tahini sauce!

40
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,954
- What's tahini sauce?
- Tahini sauce is good!

41
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,911
- Eat!
- Okay.

42
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:22,583
Yum!

43
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:31,032
We sure were a couple of lucky pups
to score this gig, Scoob.

44
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,386
Yeah, yeah!

45
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,303
Yum, yum, yum.
Stuffed eggplant!

46
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:39,229
Can you imagine quitting this job?

47
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,823
Nope.

48
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,586
Neither can I.

49
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:46,832
Like, I finally found my true calling.

50
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,027
Yummy, yummy, yummy!
Stuffed grape leaves.

51
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:00,711
That caliph is in for
the lunch of his life, Scoob.

52
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,785
I wonder what he's
gonna have for dinner.

53
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:03,943
Me too.

54
00:04:04,114 --> 00:04:08,187
The last food taster
never made it to dinner.

55
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,391
Like, you won't have
to worry about us.

56
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,829
We'll be plenty hungry
by dinner, right, Scoob?

57
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:14,268
Yeah.

58
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:18,266
- Famished.
- You do not understand.

59
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:22,905
It isn't your appetites you should
be worried about losing.

60
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:24,663
Oh, no, Scoob!

61
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:28,588
We aren't supposed to see
if the caliph's food tastes good.

62
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:31,634
We're supposed to see
if the food is...

63
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:33,791
...poisoned!
- Poisoned?

64
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:35,910
You got it, bubee.

65
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:40,352
- That's Scooby.
- Scooby, bubee, whatever.

66
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:44,350
Soon it's going to be R.I.P.

67
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,194
- Shaggy.
- Are we in heaven?

68
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:02,231
No, if this was heaven...

69
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:05,750
...all those empty plates would be
piled high with food.

70
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:08,030
Like, that must mean
we're in the other place.

71
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:10,867
Oh, no! No, Scoob!
I'm too young to die!

72
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:13,502
No, no! There's still
so many lunches to eat...

73
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:15,869
...and breakfasts and dinners too.

74
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:20,663
Relax. The food wasn't poisoned...

75
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,267
...this time.

76
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,943
Oh, boy. Like, that was a close one.

77
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:27,706
Yeah, close.

78
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:30,946
But you're still probably dead.

79
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:34,831
You ate the caliph's entire lunch.

80
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:40,267
How are my royal food tasters?

81
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:43,463
They aren't here,
so they must still be alive.

82
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,987
Oh, good!

83
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:48,112
Well, mustn't keep the caliph
waiting for his lunch.

84
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,548
Today's a big day.

85
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:53,104
He has his usual share of ruler-type
duties to attend to...

86
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:57,825
...plus the important, but happy, task
of choosing a wife.

87
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,071
My mighty majesty...

88
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:06,864
...prepare to feast your eyes
and your stomach.

89
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:08,947
That's lunch?

90
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:10,263
Yuck-o!

91
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:14,113
No, no, sire,
that's not lunch.

92
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,232
They are the ex-royal food tasters.

93
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:18,747
- Ex?
- Ex?

94
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:22,270
But we're great food tasters.
We ate everything and...

95
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,387
You guys ate my lunch?

96
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,510
The royal lunch? All of it?

97
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:31,312
Yeah, and it was terrific.

98
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,911
Great work, dude...
Sir.

99
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,304
Yeah! What's for dinner?

100
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:44,223
I'll be in the kitchen
fixing a little snack...

101
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:45,429
...if you need me.

102
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:49,826
Wow. There's a heavy penalty
for scarfing up the royal lunch.

103
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,827
Now, let's see.
What was that penalty again?

104
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,427
Oh, yeah!

105
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:58,785
Like, isn't that kind of excessive?

106
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:02,424
How's about we just go to bed
without dinner or TV?

107
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,471
- Yeah.
- Guards!

108
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,546
Yipes!

109
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:09,592
Hey, you come back here, all of you!

110
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,910
I'm sure glad it's you.

111
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:35,305
- They're around here somewhere.
- No kidding.

112
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:39,433
I would have never guessed they'd
actually be someplace we were looking.

113
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:43,872
- We must be great at our jobs!
- We should ask for a raise.

114
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,625
All right, all right.

115
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:49,228
Just don't let them get away.

116
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:52,991
Let's try in here.

117
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:56,552
I wouldn't want to be them
if we catch them in there.

118
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:08,586
Hey, what are you guys doing in here?

119
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,824
You know men are not
allowed in the harem.

120
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,433
Except for me, of course.

121
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,472
Yes, my sire, but the intruders...

122
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,307
Forget them. I've got real stuff to do.

123
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:23,023
- Like choose my wife.
- Whatever you say, sire.

124
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:24,991
Good. Then I say, so long.

125
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:27,145
Now, then, who is it going to be?

126
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:32,429
Let's see now.

127
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:35,028
She's gotta be very up
on the latest stuff.

128
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:38,391
Yeah, music, fashion, books.
She should be cool and with-it.

129
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:40,624
But smart too.
Good grades and everything.

130
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:43,310
And of course,
she's gotta be a babe.

131
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,153
- You!
- Me?

132
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:48,112
Yeah. Where have you been
all my short life?

133
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,152
Forget where you've been. All I
care about is that you're here now...

134
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,544
...and that you'll be my bride.
- I will?

135
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:57,707
Excellent. You'll make me
the happiest caliph in all Arabia.

136
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,587
Oh, no.

137
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:03,951
Like, I know how to make you
a lot happier.

138
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:06,025
No way. Really?

139
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,264
Yeah, I mean, gee, I...

140
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,709
I know. How about a story?

141
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,910
I tell a way-cool story.

142
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,826
A story? Cool.

143
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,224
Don't worry, Scoob.
It's all part of the plan.

144
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:21,069
I'II, like, tell him a real dull story and
put him to sleep. Then we can escape.

145
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:25,227
- Story, story! Story, story!
- Coming.

146
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:28,272
Well, since you're in, like,
a romantic mood...

147
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:33,952
...how's about the romantic tale
of Aliyah-din and the magic lamp?

148
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:47,463
I am truly sorry, princess.

149
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:49,943
We had hoped you would be the one...

150
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:55,552
...but you are a delightful lady and will
make the right man an excellent wife.

151
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:58,274
Believe me. It is not you.

152
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:01,232
Well, of course it isn't me!

153
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:10,674
No one is perfect, my son.

154
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,586
She wasn't perfect, Father.

155
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:14,506
I mean, there was
nothing wrong with her.

156
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:19,225
- But nothing right, either.
- There was plenty right.

157
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:22,670
- Just not enough.
- I love my son, Haman.

158
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:26,713
- I want only his happiness.
- I know, my lord.

159
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:30,988
Marriage to a wise woman who loves him
will enrich his life...

160
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:34,191
...and give him joy
he cannot even dream of.

161
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:37,312
That is exactly
what I'm looking for, Father.

162
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:40,910
Look at him, alone, brooding, forlorn.

163
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:45,545
- Look at me. Do I look happy?
- No, my lord.

164
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:49,070
But happiness was within our grasp.
Oh, yes.

165
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:53,705
Love, marriage, perfect bliss,
all ours.

166
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:58,186
The princess of Serandibe had been
promised to my son upon her birth.

167
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:04,426
She was a child of exquisite beauty
and great promise.

168
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:09,467
The kingdom's future was secure until...

169
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:15,151
Yes, sire, I know.
She was gone.

170
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:20,424
- Vanished, like a shooting star.
- A great mystery.

171
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:22,186
A greater tragedy.

172
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,868
Now the very kingdom is at risk.

173
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:27,707
With no wife, there is no heir.

174
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:31,310
I have scoured all Arabia
for a suitable bride.

175
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:34,989
And still the wedding bells
remained silent.

176
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:38,510
My son has rejected every
eligible female in the kingdom.

177
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:42,428
My son can never be sultan
if he cannot provide an heir!

178
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:45,870
And this he cannot do
without a wife.

179
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:49,549
The prince must marry,
and there will be no more delay.

180
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:51,033
Scribe!

181
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:55,671
- Make a proclamation.
- As you wish, sire.

182
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:59,622
All nobly born females in the kingdom
are to present themselves at the palace.

183
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:00,909
Tonight!

184
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:03,304
The prince will choose one for his bride.

185
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:05,863
- But, sire...
- No buts! No exceptions!

186
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:07,752
Of course...

187
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:09,552
...not, sire.

188
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:15,471
Only, how will it be possible to notify
all the eligible ladies by tonight?

189
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,864
You are right.

190
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,945
Make it tomorrow.

191
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,105
Is this necessary, Your Highness?

192
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,710
Surely the prince will find an
appropriate young lady on his own.

193
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:28,786
But when?
Soon it will be too late.

194
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:31,946
When? Who could know?

195
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:36,346
- Eventually.
- You are right, old friend.

196
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:40,702
My son will choose
in his own good time...

197
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:43,468
...but that may be too late.

198
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:50,074
It is only Haman, my prince.

199
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:53,226
You know your father means well.

200
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:55,430
He only wants you to be happy.

201
00:12:55,594 --> 00:13:00,349
So take your time
and make the right choice.

202
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,747
No matter how long it takes.

203
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:15,312
Wait! No, she can't hear me.

204
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:18,193
Wait! Gone...

205
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:26,509
Arise, O Lord of the Amulet.

206
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:33,827
Who disturbs the peace
of the Lord of the Amulet?

207
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:36,713
This humble and worthy servant
begs your counsel, O lord.

208
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:37,989
Again?

209
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:41,112
It is 18 years since I last
received your wise guidance.

210
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:45,426
And you dare present yourself
again so soon?

211
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:51,112
But, lord, the plan put into effect those
many years ago is now bearing fruit.

212
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:53,504
The abduction
of the princess of Serandibe...

213
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:57,030
...has reached the crisis point
you so long ago predicted.

214
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:58,309
Of course it has!

215
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:01,227
The old sultan's health is failing.

216
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:06,388
The young prince never married.
Soon the throne will be empty.

217
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,863
Yes. So?

218
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:14,392
This insignificant one fears his meager
magic will fail if left on its own.

219
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:18,627
Can you do nothing for yourself?

220
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:22,230
In the tomb of riches
resides the magic lamp.

221
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,908
- Tomb of riches?
- Of course you don't know.

222
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:30,831
Its location is revealed every three years
by the light of a full blue moon.

223
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:35,943
Whoever possesses the lamp controls
the power of the genie within.

224
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:42,349
But take care that the tomb of riches does
not become your own final resting place.

225
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,870
Only the pure of heart may enter...

226
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:47,911
...and leave.

227
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:50,668
- But, lord...
- I know you are not pure of heart.

228
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:54,304
- Then who...?
- Lf you will stop interrupting.

229
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:55,463
Better.

230
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:59,149
Aliyah-din can retrieve the lamp.

231
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:00,827
No other.

232
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:04,748
Tomorrow, by the light
of the full blue moon.

233
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:08,589
This happens only once every three
years and the next time is tomorrow?

234
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:14,272
Do not question the hand of fate.
And do not disturb me again.

235
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:34,625
He'll pay. They'll all pay!

236
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:47,706
I don't understand
how I can possibly help.

237
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,389
You...

238
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:53,069
You are the only chance we have.

239
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:56,670
There is, in a secret place,
a special lamp.

240
00:15:56,834 --> 00:16:01,146
Within this lamp is the last
remaining hope for our sultan.

241
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:04,943
It has been foretold that you,
and only you...

242
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:06,866
...can retrieve this lamp.

243
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:12,028
It is a great honor you have been given,
as well as a grave responsibility.

244
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:15,747
I will do what I can.
I promise.

245
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:20,032
We have little time. Meet me tonight
by the light of the full blue moon.

246
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:25,552
Do not be late.
Our sultan's fate is in your hands.

247
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:35,111
- Look, it's him!
- Isn't he cute?

248
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,265
Maybe he'll pick me.
Oh, please.

249
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:39,948
And why should he pick you
when he can have me, dear?

250
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:42,070
Quiet. He'll hear you.

251
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:44,905
I'm going to be late!

252
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:47,952
Oh! Now I'm going to be really late!

253
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:51,432
What? The prince will choose a bride...

254
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,745
...from all the eligible ladies
of Shiraz? Tomorrow?

255
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,872
Do not get too excited.
He'll never choose you.

256
00:16:58,034 --> 00:17:00,673
I know that.
Wait a minute. Why not?

257
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,065
Just look at yourself.

258
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:20,744
How can my father expect me
to marry some girl I've just met?

259
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,984
It's ridiculous!

260
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,667
Except for you.

261
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,943
Excuse me.

262
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,706
- You!
- I have to go.

263
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:32,104
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

264
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:34,788
No. Never.

265
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:38,190
Oh, I have to go.

266
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:40,267
Wait!

267
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:50,832
Wait!

268
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,384
You're late! Where have you been?

269
00:18:05,554 --> 00:18:08,546
- I'm sorry, l...
- I'm sorry too.

270
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,182
It's just the sultan...

271
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:13,390
Oh, it doesn't matter.

272
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:18,628
The blue moon can't reveal its secret
while it's clothed in clouds.

273
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:22,347
- What is it?
- The moon!

274
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:29,667
Down there, child, inside
the tomb of riches, is the lamp...

275
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,473
...and with it, your destiny.

276
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:38,152
Remember, only the purity of your soul
allows you to enter the tomb.

277
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:41,431
It is filled with
unimaginable temptations.

278
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:44,313
But take only the lamp!

279
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:03,505
Flowers! They're so lovely.

280
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:06,427
What harm can come
of picking just one?

281
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:10,511
What is taking that girl so long?

282
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,186
No! It can't be!

283
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,664
She was pure.
The Lord of the Amulet said so.

284
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:21,745
Why, you're not a flower.

285
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:24,587
I wonder if anything here
is what it seems.

286
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:27,789
The lamp!

287
00:19:31,594 --> 00:19:33,391
You're a funny little lamp.

288
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:39,234
But the wazir says that you have
the power to cure the sultan.

289
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,747
What?

290
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:44,791
No!

291
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:53,028
The lamp. My lamp!

292
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:54,422
Gone!

293
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:58,143
Cursed girl,
you have cost me my lamp...

294
00:19:58,314 --> 00:20:00,589
...but I will not be defeated.

295
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:04,030
The throne will be mine!

296
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:08,826
Haman!

297
00:20:08,994 --> 00:20:11,224
Oh, what's the use?

298
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:14,469
Are you the cause of my undoing?

299
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:16,826
No. No.

300
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:19,064
I only have myself to blame.

301
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:22,903
And what is worse,
my sultan must also suffer.

302
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:25,033
And my prince.

303
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:28,508
Tomorrow he will pick a bride.

304
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,266
And where will I be?

305
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,345
I will be here.

306
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:39,389
Well, perhaps you can at least
help me see what "here" is.

307
00:20:40,194 --> 00:20:41,946
"Rub me"?

308
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:43,991
What can that mean?

309
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:47,389
Hey, hey, hey!

310
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:58,265
Yeah, that was one long hibernation.

311
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,392
I'll bet I haven't eaten in eons.

312
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:04,871
Hey, hey, hey!
Looks like a bumper crop.

313
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:12,312
My choppers must be
out of practice.

314
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:16,712
Nothing so rare
as a bright yellow pear.

315
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,273
Yum!

316
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,225
That pear was no fair.

317
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:29,467
All these treats are a trick,
and it's not even Halloween.

318
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:34,583
Boo Boo, buddy!

319
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:37,632
Glad you could make it,
my genie-in-training-type bud.

320
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:40,831
Maybe this time,
I'll get my wisp of smoke.

321
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:45,306
Then I'll be able to fly, like you.

322
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:49,786
Yeah. With my tummy on empty,
I'm almost grounded myself, Boo Boo.

323
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:52,514
Golly, Yogi, I don't think
we're here to eat.

324
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:55,586
Hear that, tummy?
Boo Boo says no yummies.

325
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:57,631
So why are we here?

326
00:21:57,794 --> 00:22:00,513
We're here to give her
three wishes.

327
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:02,585
She's our new master, Yogi.

328
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,187
Three wishes?

329
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:06,663
You think maybe she'll
use one for say...

330
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,906
...a picnic basket that we
could all, you know, share?

331
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,268
Kind of. Sort of.

332
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:18,389
I don't believe I've had
a good night's sleep...

333
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:21,466
...since the princess
of Serandibe was lost.

334
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:24,991
Oh, well. After tomorrow,
everything will be fine.

335
00:22:25,154 --> 00:22:28,624
My son will be married.
The kingdom will be secure.

336
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,388
There will be purpose to life.

337
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:38,111
But I will never get to tomorrow without
a potion to help me sleep tonight.

338
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:42,069
Eye of newt and toe of frog...

339
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:44,065
...wool of bat and tongue of dog.

340
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:45,952
What drivel!

341
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,992
Now, this could be something.

342
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:54,751
My poor sultan...

343
00:22:54,914 --> 00:22:58,065
...wasting away over
concern for your son.

344
00:22:58,234 --> 00:22:59,428
Never sleeping...

345
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:02,233
...but Haman will help you.

346
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:04,350
Yes.

347
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:08,063
Haman will fix it
so that you'll never wake up.

348
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:15,669
Powerful stuff.

349
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:18,422
My sultan.

350
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:21,154
Haman, my trusted counsel.

351
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:25,626
- Once again, I must trouble you.
- Trouble? Never.

352
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:26,783
Here.

353
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:31,584
I brought something that cannot fail
to bring the peace you deserve.

354
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:34,746
- Breathe deeply.
- Oh, yes.

355
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:40,194
That's right. Just like that.

356
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:43,063
Excellent.

357
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:48,270
I'm sorry, Father. I never meant...

358
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:50,743
It's just all these women are...

359
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:55,388
I mean, I always thought
you wanted me to be happy.

360
00:23:55,554 --> 00:23:59,593
That is, I know
you want me to be happy.

361
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:03,383
But if it will make you happy,
I will marry tomorrow.

362
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,906
I'm sure there's one woman.

363
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:09,793
Oh, Father, I promise.

364
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:13,784
No more grief.
Tomorrow, I will marry.

365
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,353
Father!

366
00:24:16,474 --> 00:24:19,705
It's all right.
It's just a potion.

367
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:22,593
Your father is finally at peace...

368
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,824
...just as you will be!

369
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:31,510
Who needs a genie?

370
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:35,064
It's working!
Everything is working!

371
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:40,192
At least the important stuff
is working.

372
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:42,831
Sleep well, my prince...

373
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:47,023
...and may you find
the girl of your dreams...

374
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,071
...but only in your dreams.

375
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,629
I must content myself
with your throne.

376
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:55,432
But be assured...

377
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,471
...it will do!

378
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,428
What is your first wish, O master...?

379
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:04,266
Masteress...?
Ma'am?

380
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:07,267
- Wish?
- I don't think she gets it, Yogi.

381
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:08,423
No?

382
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:12,109
Well, let me make you comfy whilst
I give out with the explanations.

383
00:25:14,674 --> 00:25:17,472
Yeah, maybe a little less comfy?

384
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:19,627
Much better! Now, then...

385
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:22,672
...you have three anything-your-
little-heart-desires-type wishes...

386
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:25,746
...and if you need any more
explanation than that...

387
00:25:32,954 --> 00:25:35,070
...I can get you baba ghanouj...

388
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,069
...tabbouleh...

389
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:38,906
...or hummus...

390
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:41,310
...lip-smacking wara areesh...

391
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,385
...or finger-licking malfouf.

392
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,587
I can serve you breakfast,
brunch, dinner or lunch...

393
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,985
...or could anything be finer
than owning your own diner?

394
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:52,987
It's my task to get you
whatever you ask.

395
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,193
Hey, hey, hey! What are you
waiting for, your birthday?

396
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,584
Blow out the candles
and make like a wish.

397
00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:04,186
Now, wow,
what do you think?

398
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:06,663
Pretty good deal?

399
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,347
- Yogi!
- Not now, Boo Boo.

400
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:09,947
Can't you see
I'm granting wishes?

401
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:12,833
But, Yogi, maybe
she doesn't want food.

402
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:15,554
But goodies are such a good wish.

403
00:26:15,714 --> 00:26:19,707
Maybe for you, but how do you know
it's what she wants?

404
00:26:19,874 --> 00:26:23,389
Because I'm smarter
than the average genie.

405
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:26,114
Besides, what else
could she possibly want?

406
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:28,708
Well, I don't know. Let's ask.

407
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:30,747
- Hi.
- Hi.

408
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:33,310
Is this your wish?

409
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:41,349
- Come on out, Yogi.
- I can't, Boo Boo.

410
00:26:41,514 --> 00:26:43,232
I'm all out of ideas.

411
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,988
Well, why don't we ask...?

412
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,709
- What's your name?
- Aliyah-din.

413
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:52,230
That's a nice name.
Mine's Boo Boo.

414
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,350
That's Yogi.

415
00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:56,506
Why don't you ask...?

416
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:00,553
Great idea, Boob!

417
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:03,547
Almost as good as if
I thought of it myself.

418
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:06,148
So, what can ol' Yogi get you?

419
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:08,384
Just name it, and it's yours.

420
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:11,591
What do you want, Ali?
What's your heart's desire?

421
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:15,383
Oh, what's the use?
I can never have it.

422
00:27:15,554 --> 00:27:16,703
It's far too much.

423
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:19,866
Let us genies be the judges of that.

424
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:22,743
Well, if I could have any wish...

425
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:26,748
...I would save my poor sultan
who languishes near death.

426
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:30,949
And if I could have another wish...

427
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,309
...I would make myself
worthy of the prince.

428
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:37,588
But it doesn't really matter.

429
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:40,063
I'm only a simple, common girl.

430
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:43,544
And besides, the prince is probably
married by now anyway.

431
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:45,587
Not just yet.

432
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:48,188
- You mean it's possible?
- It's more than possible.

433
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:51,073
- It's a done deal!
- And that's only two wishes.

434
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,667
You still have one left.

435
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:56,986
Right, Boo Boo. Perhaps I can
interest you in a little snack.

436
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,387
Yogi!

437
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:01,944
But for me to be worthy of a prince...

438
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,992
...I must be a princess.
- She catches on quick.

439
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:09,702
- How do I look?
- See for yourself.

440
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:14,789
And, of course...

441
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:18,310
...what's a princess
without a princess' dowry?

442
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:21,149
How's that for rich?

443
00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:23,748
Not to mention high in vitamins
and nutrients.

444
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:25,791
That's for the prince, Yogi!

445
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,310
I was just gonna sample it
to make sure it was fresh.

446
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:34,103
This is all so amazing.
I don't know what to say.

447
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:37,391
You don't have time to say anything
if you want to get to the prince...

448
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:40,193
...before he gets hitched...
Married, that is.

449
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:43,553
What's the matter, Ali?

450
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:46,103
Yeah! You gotta get go, go, going!

451
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:48,708
- But how?
- How?

452
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,830
You are looking at
the genuine article, Ali.

453
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:54,907
A-one, full-service, money-back-
guarantee-if-you're-not-satisfied genies.

454
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:57,952
Oh, thank you!
You're so wonderful!

455
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,192
End of the line, sugar.

456
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:24,073
A thousand and one pardons,
your honor.

457
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,462
Oh, what's the use?

458
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,671
I can't compete with
the noblest ladies of the realm.

459
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,223
Hey, hey, hey! Why so blue-blue...

460
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:38,147
...when you got Yogi and Boo Boo?

461
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:40,669
The prince will never even notice me.

462
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:43,746
The prince won't even seen them
with you around.

463
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:46,906
- You really think so?
- Abso-dabba-lutely.

464
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:58,346
Well, I'm still in training.

465
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:03,312
See, Ali?
It's your turn already.

466
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:04,623
It can't be!

467
00:30:04,794 --> 00:30:08,230
Get going and break
the proverbial leg.

468
00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:28,982
And who...

469
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:32,991
...might you be, my dear?

470
00:30:33,154 --> 00:30:35,873
- Me? I'm...
- My lord!

471
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:40,422
- My lord!
- Scribe...

472
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:42,107
...I'm glad you are here.

473
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,708
You may dismiss
the rest of the candidates.

474
00:30:45,154 --> 00:30:48,829
But there aren't
any more candidates.

475
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:51,713
- Good.
- You don't understand, sire.

476
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:54,468
There were more. Lots more!

477
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:56,511
They just...

478
00:30:57,474 --> 00:30:59,863
...disappeared.
- Did they?

479
00:31:00,034 --> 00:31:01,786
How convenient.

480
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:04,024
You may go, scribe.

481
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:06,113
I said, go!

482
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:08,583
Now, then, my dear...

483
00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:10,312
...your name?

484
00:31:11,474 --> 00:31:13,465
Your name!

485
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:16,465
I don't know.

486
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:17,623
What is it?

487
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,944
- Aliyah-din.
- Who's that?

488
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:22,787
- You!
- Really? How nice.

489
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:27,067
My name is Aliyah-din, my lord.

490
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:32,509
A lovely name
for such a lovely lady.

491
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:33,789
Thank you, sire.

492
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:37,629
I do not come empty-handed.
I have an ample dowry.

493
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:41,393
The most beautiful and gracious lady
in the kingdom...

494
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:44,671
...is all the riches
I could ever want.

495
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,789
Although, perhaps a simple token...

496
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:52,866
...that lamp at your side,
for instance.

497
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:58,105
Mine! Finally, mine!

498
00:31:59,394 --> 00:32:00,588
No!

499
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:04,867
No longer must I hide
behind foolish disguises.

500
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:09,152
Now, I alone have the power!

501
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,146
Hey, hey, hey!

502
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:15,267
Are we ready for a wedding-type feast?

503
00:32:17,194 --> 00:32:18,627
I guess not.

504
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:21,149
I am your master now.

505
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,748
You must do as I wish.

506
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:25,984
As you wish, master.

507
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,382
Good!

508
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:31,263
For my first wish, I would have you
make me sultan...

509
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:34,471
...with all the trappings and majesty
of the office.

510
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:37,344
As you wish, master.

511
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:43,113
Guards, seize her and throw her
in the dungeon!

512
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:48,143
Now...

513
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:51,067
...let the real wishes begin.

514
00:32:58,114 --> 00:33:00,389
Oh, my prince!

515
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:17,390
What is to become of us?

516
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:19,033
Our Lord...

517
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:21,549
...rescue us from our oppressors...

518
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:23,989
...and raise for us from thee...

519
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:25,985
...one who will protect...

520
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:29,783
...and raise for us from thee
one who will help.

521
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:33,589
We will be fine, my prince.

522
00:33:33,754 --> 00:33:35,392
Allah is watching.

523
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:37,306
He will guide me.

524
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:39,906
His majesty...

525
00:33:40,074 --> 00:33:44,067
...Haman, sultan of Shiraz!

526
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:46,304
It has such a nice ring to it.

527
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:47,702
Now, then...

528
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:52,629
...what to do about those
other two pesky wishes?

529
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:55,228
Rise and shine, genie.

530
00:33:58,474 --> 00:34:01,147
Is it an earthquake?

531
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:03,430
Oh, it's worse.

532
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:07,064
- It's you.
- Yes, it's me.

533
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:10,192
What do you need, master,
some Dramamine?

534
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:14,142
No, but I do need my second wish.

535
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:19,427
How's about a little public feast
to celebrate your sultanship?

536
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:22,745
- No!
- Not even a teensy-weensy feast?

537
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:23,903
No!

538
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:26,907
- How about toasted marshmallows?
- No!

539
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:30,272
What's going on?

540
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:35,866
Not so fast, genie-in-training.
This is where you win your wisp of smoke.

541
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:41,986
Yes. Why simply rule Shiraz
when I can rule the world?

542
00:34:42,154 --> 00:34:44,270
Why not?

543
00:34:44,434 --> 00:34:45,787
Here we go again.

544
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:50,072
Yep. Another power-hungry evil guy
bent on world "donimation."

545
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:53,271
Nobody's ever happy with
a kingdom, a beautiful wife...

546
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:56,744
...and all the gold they can count.
- They're all alike.

547
00:34:56,914 --> 00:35:00,702
If you're through, I'd like to make
my second wish now.

548
00:35:00,874 --> 00:35:02,671
Your wish is my command.

549
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,028
I know.

550
00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:09,109
For my second wish, I want supremacy
over the entire universe!

551
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:13,028
You're sure you wouldn't want
maybe a cheese sandwich...

552
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,344
...and a nectarine instead?
- No!

553
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:19,905
- Aren't you even a little bit hungry?
- Hungry? Yes.

554
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,587
Hungry for power!

555
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:26,107
You'd think some of this hunger would
go to his stomach instead of his head.

556
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:29,584
- Just do as I wish!
- Gee, what a grouch.

557
00:35:30,034 --> 00:35:32,707
Hey, hey, hey!

558
00:35:38,874 --> 00:35:40,307
I wish...

559
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:44,829
I'm sorry, my prince.
I have no more wishes.

560
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:46,985
Oh, prince!

561
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,788
I shall return, my darling, I promise.

562
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:05,786
Finally! My power is complete!

563
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:08,707
The world turns at my whim!

564
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:10,751
Maybe now we can eat.

565
00:36:14,194 --> 00:36:17,072
Now, then, about my third wish...

566
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:20,704
Gee, I hope it's gonna be a falafel
or tabbouleh.

567
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:24,025
Granting wishes isn't easy
when your stomach's always queasy.

568
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:43,792
A third wish.

569
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:48,311
What else can I possibly want
now that I have everything?

570
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:50,112
The lamp!

571
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:12,265
What do you get for the man
who has, quite literally, everything?

572
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:16,632
- A queen to share...
- I do not share anything...

573
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:19,706
...with anyone!
- Of course not.

574
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:22,627
What could I have possibly
been thinking of?

575
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:29,109
- For my third...
- And final!

576
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:31,823
...and final wish...

577
00:37:31,994 --> 00:37:33,712
...I wish to live forever...

578
00:37:33,874 --> 00:37:37,833
...so that I may rule the universe
throughout eternity!

579
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:42,704
- Yogi!
- What is it, my genie-in-training buddy?

580
00:37:44,194 --> 00:37:46,583
Oh! Really?

581
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:50,224
- You are completely correct, Boo Boo.
- I demand my wish!

582
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,470
- Nope.
- No way.

583
00:37:52,674 --> 00:37:55,871
You must obey! I own the lamp!

584
00:37:57,954 --> 00:37:59,785
No!

585
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:12,864
Hey, hey, hey!
What's your first wish, tiny masteress?

586
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:16,026
I wish that everything was
as it should be.

587
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:18,589
My pleasure, masteress.

588
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,471
Guards, arrest him!

589
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,788
You can't do this. Put me down!

590
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:31,991
- I am your supreme ruler!
- Not anymore!

591
00:38:38,594 --> 00:38:39,913
My scarf!

592
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:42,634
I've been searching for you
to return it.

593
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,065
I don't even know your name.

594
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:49,386
- Aliyah-din.
- Aliyah-din.

595
00:38:49,554 --> 00:38:53,183
Aliyah-din, you are the girl of my dreams.

596
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:55,390
Say you will become my princess.

597
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,784
Are you sure you really want me?

598
00:38:57,994 --> 00:39:00,588
How could you think anything else?

599
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:04,747
You don't understand.
Your love isn't given freely.

600
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:07,474
You see, I wished for your love.

601
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:10,387
I was bewitched the moment I saw you.

602
00:39:10,554 --> 00:39:12,704
Then we both got our wishes?

603
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:16,105
We will, the moment
you consent to be mine.

604
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:18,742
Did I hear someone say marriage?

605
00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:21,707
- Well, where is she?
- This is she, Father.

606
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:25,913
She is lovely, son,
but you cannot marry just anyone.

607
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:29,023
That is, you are a prince.

608
00:39:29,194 --> 00:39:32,152
You must marry a woman
of noble birth...

609
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:36,313
...a wise woman who can advise you
and enrich your life.

610
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:40,672
But, Father, she will be
all those things and more.

611
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,586
You don't understand, son.

612
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:47,384
The succession is only assured
if you marry someone of noble birth.

613
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,671
I cannot condone this marriage.

614
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,984
What is your wish, masteress?

615
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:56,032
Genie, I wish to be a princess.

616
00:39:57,274 --> 00:40:01,267
Royalty, nobility, these are things
that come from within...

617
00:40:01,714 --> 00:40:03,830
...not from without.

618
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:09,824
- I'm sorry, Aliyah-din, but our love...
- What did you call her?

619
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:12,906
- Aliyah-din.
- Can it be?

620
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:17,268
Aliyah-din was the very name
of the lost princess of Serandibe...

621
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:19,550
...who was promised to you at birth.

622
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:21,989
I don't know how it is possible...

623
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:25,271
...but your Aliyah-din
is that very princess.

624
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:26,787
By royal decree...

625
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:29,422
...let the marriage proceed at once!

626
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:34,272
Genie, for my final wish,
I wish for a huge wedding!

627
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:38,552
With an equally huge picnic-type
wedding feast, I hope.

628
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:42,592
Your command is my wish.

629
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:48,102
And fulfilling all your wishes
will be my life's joy.

630
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:58,424
Hey, hey, hey, Boo Boo!
You're a full-fledged genie!

631
00:40:58,594 --> 00:41:02,872
- What are you gonna do now?
- That's easy, Yogi. How about...?

632
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,666
I just...

633
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,268
I just love a happy ending.

634
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:23,789
And, like, they lived happily ever after,
like all good stories end.

635
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:25,785
Boy, that was neat.

636
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,544
- Okay, story's over. Wedding time.
- Right.

637
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:33,112
But I could never get married
in this old thing.

638
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:37,193
Yucky! Good thing I let the royal
dressmaker in on our plans.

639
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:39,986
Like, my thoughts exactly.

640
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,864
- Your majesty?
- It's you.

641
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:57,549
- It's you, all right.
- Are you sure I'm really your type?

642
00:41:57,754 --> 00:42:00,951
I don't want you to be sorry
that you married me.

643
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:04,112
You're smart, fun and a babe.
Exactly my type.

644
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:08,148
- Where is that assistant?
- Coming!

645
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,783
- Tell another story.
- Great idea.

646
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:14,064
I mean, great idea!

647
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:18,708
Well, like, we're stuck here anyway.
How about...?

648
00:42:18,874 --> 00:42:20,751
Sorry.

649
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:23,468
Maybe something a little less romantic.

650
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:25,864
Like Sinbad the Sailor.

651
00:42:34,394 --> 00:42:36,146
- He's lost his mind!
- He's crazy!

652
00:42:36,314 --> 00:42:38,350
- Run! Flee!
- Get out of here!

653
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:43,542
Mutineers!
Run! I will get another crew.

654
00:42:43,714 --> 00:42:47,627
Nothing will stop me
from finding my treasure!

655
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:51,188
Perhaps I should place an ad
in the personals.

656
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,027
Can't wait to start the vacation I won.

657
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:02,185
Better get on the right boat.

658
00:43:03,594 --> 00:43:06,188
But which one is right?

659
00:43:06,354 --> 00:43:07,469
Left, right.

660
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,622
This has gotta be it.
It's on the right.

661
00:43:12,794 --> 00:43:14,705
Although it is kind of small.

662
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:18,031
Small?!
Did I hear small?

663
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:20,072
Who said that?

664
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:24,071
- The captain, you son of a camel!
- Captain?

665
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:28,632
Sinbad the Sailor reporting
for vacation, captain, sir.

666
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:31,472
You may set sail, ready!

667
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:41,782
Oh, welcome aboard.

668
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:45,105
Oh, did I forget to mention?

669
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:47,504
I'm not only the captain...

670
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:50,108
...I am the cruise director too.

671
00:43:50,554 --> 00:43:54,069
You will have the vacation of your life...

672
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:55,667
...or your money back.

673
00:43:57,794 --> 00:44:00,308
No napping on my cruise ship!

674
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:01,793
But...

675
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:05,828
You do not want to sleep
through the fun, do you?

676
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:08,543
Fun? What fun?

677
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:13,668
Whoever catches the biggest fish wins.

678
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,863
Why, it feels like you have got a big one!

679
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:20,707
Do not let it get away!

680
00:44:21,514 --> 00:44:25,063
Wow! Heavy! I can taste it already!

681
00:44:25,234 --> 00:44:28,192
Tender, flaky and no fishy taste, either.

682
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,147
Got him!

683
00:44:36,514 --> 00:44:38,072
Gee, he got away.

684
00:44:38,234 --> 00:44:41,032
I guess you win, captain. Captain?

685
00:44:49,474 --> 00:44:52,227
Ruhk's egg. Precious gems.

686
00:44:52,394 --> 00:44:54,749
Golden toothbrush.

687
00:44:55,314 --> 00:44:57,782
When do we play our next game, captain?

688
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:01,351
Game?! Oh, yes.
Game, game, game, game.

689
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:05,424
I know. How about a scavenger hunt?

690
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:06,913
Scavenger hunt?

691
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:10,066
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

692
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:12,903
An egg?

693
00:45:13,074 --> 00:45:16,783
Boy, scavenger hunts sure send you
looking for weird stuff.

694
00:45:16,954 --> 00:45:20,424
Not just any egg! A Ruhk's egg!

695
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:24,753
They are rare and real big!

696
00:45:25,114 --> 00:45:26,149
A big egg.

697
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:28,544
Like I said, weird stuff.

698
00:45:28,714 --> 00:45:30,432
Do not talk! Look!

699
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,550
Aye, aye, captain!

700
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:37,106
Thar she blows! I mean, egg ahoy!

701
00:45:37,394 --> 00:45:38,986
I mean, I found it.

702
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,267
Land ho!

703
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,904
First one to the egg
gets to keep it!

704
00:45:46,074 --> 00:45:47,985
That is my egg!

705
00:45:55,914 --> 00:45:57,188
This'll be a snap.

706
00:46:03,754 --> 00:46:05,949
This isn't much of a competition.

707
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:07,303
Come on!

708
00:46:16,914 --> 00:46:19,826
Shoo! Scat! Go away!

709
00:46:41,914 --> 00:46:45,543
Wow! It looked so tiny
in the little spyglass.

710
00:46:45,714 --> 00:46:47,272
It's much bigger in person.

711
00:46:50,234 --> 00:46:51,986
It's mine! All mine!

712
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:55,191
You sure you want to eat that
all by yourself?

713
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:59,427
- It is mine, mine, mine!
- Okay, but that's a lot of cholesterol...

714
00:46:59,594 --> 00:47:02,028
...for a little guy like you.

715
00:47:50,674 --> 00:47:54,144
I really didn't think he could
get it down all by himself.

716
00:48:07,474 --> 00:48:10,227
Captain! Oh, captain!

717
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:11,952
There you are, captain.

718
00:48:12,554 --> 00:48:13,953
Mine...

719
00:48:17,034 --> 00:48:18,228
Tell that to her.

720
00:48:22,714 --> 00:48:25,274
It's mine! Mine! Mine!

721
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:32,470
I must find some place to hide you.

722
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:45,791
Shove off! Shove off!

723
00:48:45,954 --> 00:48:48,024
- Excuse me?
- I said...

724
00:48:48,194 --> 00:48:50,833
...raise the anchor
and get us out of here!

725
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:58,786
Bye. Bon voyage! Thanks for the egg!

726
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:10,550
Captain, that birdie's back.

727
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,831
Birdie. Do not be ridiculous.

728
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:17,430
We are miles from land.
What birdie could...?

729
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:22,583
That birdie.

730
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:31,503
The Ruhk is raining rocks on us.

731
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:34,389
Yeah, fun, huh?

732
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:42,112
What a ride!

733
00:49:43,034 --> 00:49:45,309
You sure run a great
vacation cruise.

734
00:49:57,674 --> 00:49:59,266
Keep a lookout.

735
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:02,107
The next items on the scavenger hunt...

736
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:06,153
...are jewels from
the stream of precious gems.

737
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:09,226
Aye, aye, your captainship, sir.

738
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,710
Stream of precious gems, ho!

739
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:22,473
The stream of precious gems
is a roller coaster ride?!

740
00:50:22,634 --> 00:50:24,431
I love rides.

741
00:50:26,914 --> 00:50:28,905
- It's marvelous.
- Get back in line.

742
00:50:29,074 --> 00:50:31,383
- Move out of my way!
- Get back in line.

743
00:50:32,714 --> 00:50:34,193
Get this line moving!

744
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:45,750
Sir, I'm sorry, but your son
is too short to ride.

745
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:48,382
He's got to be as tall as the parrot.

746
00:50:48,554 --> 00:50:51,432
Short?! I will show you short!

747
00:50:53,194 --> 00:50:57,904
There. Now I am tall enough.

748
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:06,551
Please keep your hands and arms
inside the log.

749
00:51:06,714 --> 00:51:07,942
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

750
00:51:08,114 --> 00:51:11,265
Anything you say, sir.

751
00:51:12,234 --> 00:51:16,466
Our hands will be too busy grabbing
diamonds, rubies and emeralds...

752
00:51:16,634 --> 00:51:18,943
...to stay inside.

753
00:51:19,114 --> 00:51:23,983
Remember, whoever has
the most jewels at the end wins!

754
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:26,465
And I will keep them all.

755
00:51:30,474 --> 00:51:33,750
Look, but do not touch!

756
00:51:33,914 --> 00:51:38,351
Many braver than you have tried
to steal the treasure within.

757
00:51:38,754 --> 00:51:42,588
But no one has succeeded yet.

758
00:51:44,154 --> 00:51:47,783
Hang on! Sounds like a big waterfall
coming up.

759
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:49,148
I do not worry.

760
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,226
They always try to scare you
on these rides.

761
00:51:52,394 --> 00:51:55,272
It will just be a teeny-weeny,
paltry little...

762
00:51:58,034 --> 00:51:59,911
Yippee!

763
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,063
Grab everything!

764
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:14,468
- Captain.
- Do not bother me!

765
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:17,148
You should be grabbing jewels.

766
00:52:20,314 --> 00:52:22,669
- But, captain.
- Do not "but, captain" me.

767
00:52:23,154 --> 00:52:25,031
I said...

768
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:07,230
Wow! A beautiful recreation
of the legendary Davy Jones' locker.

769
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:11,831
And the even more legendary
jeweled football.

770
00:53:18,794 --> 00:53:20,307
Say "cheesy."

771
00:53:36,234 --> 00:53:38,111
Touchdown!

772
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:55,303
Mine! All mine!

773
00:54:04,114 --> 00:54:05,308
Hello.

774
00:54:16,234 --> 00:54:18,828
Gee, it looks like a pretty dull ride.

775
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:21,144
And way too short too.

776
00:54:27,994 --> 00:54:30,064
The golden toothbrush.

777
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:34,103
Prized for a 24-carat gold handle...

778
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:39,189
...and its very stiff,
deep-massaging bristles.

779
00:54:40,954 --> 00:54:42,706
Land ho!

780
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:49,103
How can you read that sign, captain?

781
00:54:49,274 --> 00:54:53,665
- What sign?
- See? You're too close.

782
00:54:55,274 --> 00:54:57,742
Now, isn't that better?

783
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:04,833
You have found the secret path
to the golden toothbrush!

784
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:10,547
Does this mean I don't get
to build a sandcastle?

785
00:55:10,714 --> 00:55:12,432
Perhaps later.

786
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:24,945
Gee, that looks like fun.

787
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:27,111
Get me down this instant!

788
00:55:27,634 --> 00:55:28,623
Smile.

789
00:55:31,674 --> 00:55:33,426
Perhaps not this quickly.

790
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:34,868
Help again.

791
00:55:37,994 --> 00:55:42,909
You have saved me again!
Now let us get after the toothbrush.

792
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:45,144
No smooch?

793
00:55:45,314 --> 00:55:47,874
After we get the toothbrush.

794
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:01,349
There's the golden toothbrush.

795
00:56:01,514 --> 00:56:04,904
- First one down gets it.
- Yes, indeed.

796
00:56:05,074 --> 00:56:07,986
But it is a long way down.

797
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:11,744
And there does not appear
to be any way back up either.

798
00:56:12,314 --> 00:56:16,102
Well, my friend,
it looks as if this time...

799
00:56:20,554 --> 00:56:22,431
...you will win.

800
00:56:22,834 --> 00:56:27,191
Gee, I hope I didn't get an unfair
advantage over the captain.

801
00:56:38,114 --> 00:56:41,390
Sure is dark, drafty and foreboding
in here.

802
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,310
And wet too.

803
00:56:45,474 --> 00:56:48,784
They think of everything
on these cruises.

804
00:56:58,714 --> 00:57:01,148
"M. Cyclops, Esquire."

805
00:57:01,634 --> 00:57:03,750
Wow! A Cyclops too.

806
00:57:03,914 --> 00:57:06,587
This is gonna be great!

807
00:57:12,274 --> 00:57:13,707
Yes?

808
00:57:14,074 --> 00:57:17,749
Hello. You must be here to sell
gorilla-scout cookies.

809
00:57:17,914 --> 00:57:21,145
I'll have several boxes of peanut butter
banana dreams.

810
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:24,192
- I love those.
- I love them too...

811
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:28,267
...but that's not why I'm here.
- Too bad.

812
00:57:28,434 --> 00:57:32,188
- Well, what are you here for?
- To see the golden toothbrush.

813
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:36,944
Down the hall, third door on the left.

814
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:38,708
Tourists.

815
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:44,345
- Nice place.
- Thanks. I like it.

816
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:57,148
Wow! These bristles are stiff!

817
00:57:58,514 --> 00:58:01,984
How much time does one need
to look at a toothbrush?

818
00:58:02,674 --> 00:58:06,269
I'll give you 10 seconds
and not a moment longer.

819
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:08,784
Can't wait all day, I'm a busy Cyclops.

820
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:12,790
Are you done yet?

821
00:58:15,754 --> 00:58:18,905
I say, I've got tickets to <i>Cats.</i>

822
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:23,862
They were hard to get.

823
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,229
You asked for it. I'm coming in.

824
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,507
Gone!

825
00:58:32,954 --> 00:58:35,229
Two can play this little game...

826
00:58:35,434 --> 00:58:41,031
...although some of us
are a little big for games.

827
00:58:46,634 --> 00:58:49,102
I admire his commitment
to hygienic excellence...

828
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:52,311
...but I am not going to give up
without a fight.

829
00:58:52,474 --> 00:58:56,149
After all, it is 24-carat gold,
and the bristles are very stiff...

830
00:58:56,314 --> 00:59:00,626
...for deep cleaning and a satisfying
gum <i>massage:</i>

831
00:59:01,034 --> 00:59:04,185
You come back here
with that toothbrush!

832
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:09,751
- I just need to borrow it.
- Borrow it?

833
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:11,870
That's disgusting!

834
00:59:12,034 --> 00:59:14,832
Give it over and we'll call it square.

835
00:59:26,074 --> 00:59:27,393
Drat!

836
00:59:29,834 --> 00:59:30,823
Come on!

837
00:59:31,794 --> 00:59:35,309
I know I'm going to miss
the opening song of <i>Cats.</i>

838
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:40,307
Penthouse, and step on it.

839
00:59:44,674 --> 00:59:47,586
Go away! That is my banana!

840
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:51,030
- Thanks, captain, sir.
- Never mind the thanks.

841
00:59:51,194 --> 00:59:53,424
Where is that toothbrush?

842
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:56,233
- Mine!
- Hey, what about me?

843
00:59:56,434 --> 00:59:58,311
Get your own golden toothbrush.

844
00:59:59,274 --> 01:00:00,627
Gotcha!

845
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:02,707
Mine, mine, mine.

846
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:10,587
See here, I'm going to get
awfully angry...

847
01:00:10,754 --> 01:00:14,224
...if you don't come back
with that toothbrush.

848
01:00:15,994 --> 01:00:20,784
You have no idea what happens to me
if I don't brush after every meal.

849
01:00:21,594 --> 01:00:23,869
You'll have to come down eventually.

850
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:26,707
I've got all day.
I've already missed Cats...

851
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,991
...and I brought a good book
to read.

852
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:32,909
Look what you have done,
you big gorilla.

853
01:00:33,074 --> 01:00:34,427
Now we are trapped!

854
01:00:34,594 --> 01:00:37,108
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

855
01:00:37,274 --> 01:00:40,949
- What time is it?
- Time for me to get a new gorilla.

856
01:00:41,114 --> 01:00:42,513
I say.

857
01:00:42,674 --> 01:00:47,668
Amazing how things happen
right on cue in a cartoon, isn't it?

858
01:00:49,514 --> 01:00:52,586
The island, it is sinking!

859
01:01:00,434 --> 01:01:04,188
Raise the sails. Raise the sails!

860
01:01:32,874 --> 01:01:34,990
I guess it's time to say goodbye.

861
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:38,112
These cheap trinkets will bring back
great memories.

862
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:40,708
My... My jewels.

863
01:01:40,874 --> 01:01:43,263
My toothbrush.

864
01:01:43,514 --> 01:01:47,029
It's great the way you let
the passengers win.

865
01:01:47,234 --> 01:01:48,747
I had a wonderful time...

866
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:53,351
...and I'm going to recommend you
to all my friends.

867
01:01:56,834 --> 01:02:00,144
Nothing. I have nothing!

868
01:02:00,314 --> 01:02:03,511
My boat, my jewels,
my toothbrush.

869
01:02:03,674 --> 01:02:06,313
My Ruhk egg.

870
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:10,467
Wait one minute.

871
01:02:10,634 --> 01:02:13,432
I still have my Ruhk egg.

872
01:02:13,594 --> 01:02:16,631
I can sell it and not only recoup
all my losses...

873
01:02:16,794 --> 01:02:19,388
...but have enough money to...

874
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:29,544
Mama. Mama.

875
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:44,866
Toodle-Ioo, Donna and Gordon.

876
01:02:45,034 --> 01:02:49,664
I had a marvelous time.
Let's do this again next year.

877
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:53,349
My toothbrush!

878
01:02:55,034 --> 01:02:56,353
Mine!

879
01:02:56,514 --> 01:02:59,711
I have my toothbrush!
I'm oral-hygienically secure.

880
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:04,186
Protected from plaque,
cavity comfy, safe from morning breath.

881
01:03:05,674 --> 01:03:06,663
Mama!

882
01:03:07,194 --> 01:03:08,593
Mama.

883
01:03:08,954 --> 01:03:11,991
- I'm not your mama.
- Mama!

884
01:03:12,154 --> 01:03:15,351
I can't be your mama because...

885
01:03:17,954 --> 01:03:19,785
Because she's your mama.

886
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:31,023
Gee, that was swell.

887
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:33,623
I am one lucky dude to get you.

888
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,664
- Oh, sire.
- Let's scram, Shaggy.

889
01:03:37,194 --> 01:03:40,072
You're everything a guy could want
and modest too.

890
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:43,306
- The perfect companion for life.
- I can't go.

891
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:45,829
Didn't you hear? I'm perfect.

892
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:50,152
- Let the wedding begin.
- How can you have a wedding without...?

893
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:52,072
Without what?

894
01:03:52,554 --> 01:03:55,432
Without... Without a wedding cake.

895
01:03:55,594 --> 01:03:58,870
Did someone say cake?

896
01:03:59,274 --> 01:04:00,946
Yummy. Looks tasty, huh?

897
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:03,748
Like, how can I tell until I taste it?

898
01:04:08,874 --> 01:04:11,513
- Wow!
- Yummy!

899
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,791
- It's them!
- Them who?

900
01:04:14,034 --> 01:04:16,423
The ex-royal food tasters.

901
01:04:17,034 --> 01:04:19,070
Like, hide!

902
01:04:19,434 --> 01:04:22,506
- What's the problem?
- There's the problem.

903
01:04:22,674 --> 01:04:24,824
Great. Cake!

904
01:04:26,114 --> 01:04:30,187
No, you fools! The ex-royal food tasters.

905
01:04:32,394 --> 01:04:34,749
- Like, hi.
- Yeah, hi.

906
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:40,473
Zoinks!

907
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:46,304
Well, this cake is just perfect.
Like, let's proceed with the wedding.

908
01:04:47,794 --> 01:04:52,709
Sire, you must send these fools
to their final reward at once.

909
01:04:55,114 --> 01:04:58,151
Don't worry, Scoob.
At least our last meal was good.

910
01:04:58,634 --> 01:05:01,512
Gee, I don't know.
They weren't bad food tasters.

911
01:05:01,674 --> 01:05:05,633
- I didn't die of food poisoning.
- You didn't eat anything either.

912
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:08,712
Well, the stories were so neat
I forgot I was hungry.

913
01:05:08,874 --> 01:05:11,263
Okay, your lives are spared...

914
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:14,312
...if you stay on as royal storytellers.

915
01:05:15,114 --> 01:05:17,548
- Great.
- Not so fast, Scoob.

916
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:20,274
Like, maybe we could be
royal storytellers...

917
01:05:20,434 --> 01:05:22,948
...and royal food tasters.

918
01:05:23,914 --> 01:05:27,907
If you two are my food tasters, I may
never eat again, and I'm still growing.

919
01:05:28,314 --> 01:05:32,102
Well, at least you'll never die
of food poisoning.

920
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:37,312
Hey, there's some risks you've
just gotta take.

921
01:05:40,874 --> 01:05:44,583
Say, this isn't bad.

922
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:51,183
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
