00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:34,377
Call came in
with impeccable timing,

180
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:39,317
right as I was driving here to
ground your ass once and for all.

181
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:42,686
[Scoffs]
It galls me to say it, but...

182
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:47,824
For reasons known only to the
almighty and your guardian angel...

183
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:52,362
You've been called back
to top gun.

184
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:59,836
Sir? You are dismissed, captain.

185
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:07,477
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

186
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,846
Your kind is headed
for extinction.

187
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,086
Maybe so, sir.

188
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,388
But not today.

189
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,488
[Person] <i>Captain Pete</i>
<i>"Maverick" Mitchell.</i>

190
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:28,757
Your reputation precedes you.

191
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,027
Thank you, sir.

192
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,862
Wasn't a compliment.

193
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:37,533
I'm admiral Beau Simpson.
I'm the air boss.

194
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,136
I believe you know
admiral bates. Warlock, sir.

195
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,006
Must admit, I wasn't
expecting an invitation back.

196
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:45,208
They're called orders, Maverick.

197
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:47,810
You two have
something in common.

198
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,713
Cyclone here was first
in his class back in '88.

199
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,983
Actually, sir,
I finished second.

200
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:55,784
Just want to manage
expectations.

201
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:57,886
[Sighs]

202
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:01,157
The target...

203
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,728
Is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

204
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:08,164
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

205
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:11,401
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

206
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:12,701
to our allies in the region.

207
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:14,304
The Pentagon has tasked us

208
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:16,973
with assembling a strike
team and taking it out

209
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:19,575
before it becomes
fully operational.

210
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,712
The plant sits in an underground
bunker at the end of this valley.

211
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:25,348
Said valley is GPS-jammed

212
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:28,218
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

213
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,054
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

214
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:35,291
which in turn are backed up by a
plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

215
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,427
Even a few old f-14s.

216
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,196
Seems like we're not the only
ones holding on to old relics.

217
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,100
[Warlock]
What's your read, captain?

218
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:49,305
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the f-35's stealth,

219
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,740
but the GPS-jamming
negates that.

220
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:55,811
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

221
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:57,414
tailor-made for the f-18.

222
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:58,982
I figure,

223
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:01,017
two precision bombs, minimum.

224
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:04,054
Makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs.

225
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,256
That is one hell of a
steep climb out of there,

226
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:09,058
exposing you to all
the surface-to-air missiles.

227
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,060
You survive that,

228
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,462
it's a dogfight
all the way home.

229
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:16,898
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

230
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,600
Not in the same mission, sir.

231
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:23,205
No.

232
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,343
No, someone's
not coming back from this.

233
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,777
Can it be done or not?

234
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,381
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

235
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,383
Three weeks. Maybe less.

236
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,320
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an f-18, and...

237
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,656
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

238
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,858
But I'll find a way
to make it work.

239
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:45,928
I think you misunderstand,
captain.

240
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,361
Sir?

241
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:49,298
We don't want you to fly it.

242
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:50,832
We want you to teach it.

243
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:54,970
Teach, sir?

244
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:59,740
We've recalled 12 top gun
graduates from their squadrons.

245
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:02,277
We want you to narrow
that pool down to six.

246
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:05,080
They'll fly the mission.

247
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,183
Is there a problem, captain?

248
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:12,354
You know there is, sir.

249
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,590
Yeah.

250
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:17,159
Bradley bradshaw,
aka "rooster."

251
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,361
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

252
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:21,363
What was his call sign?

253
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:23,565
"Goose," sir.

254
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,000
Tragic what happened.

255
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:26,974
Captain Mitchell was
cleared of any wrongdoing.

256
00:20:27,035 --> 00:20:28,836
Goose's death was an accident.

257

[Cyclone]
Is that how you see it, captain?

258
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,041
Is that how goose's son sees it?

259
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:38,746
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

260
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,349
You were a top gun
instructor before.

261
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:42,951
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

262

fact, you weren't even on the list.

You are here at the request
of admiral kazansky.

266

Now, iceman happens to be
a man I deeply admire,

267
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,036

have something left to offer the Navy.

don't fly for the Navy ever again.

run per the mission parameters.

697
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,757
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, captain.

698
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,592
[Hangman] <i>Yo, coyote.</i>

699
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,594
Take a look at this.

700
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:30,001
[Coyote] The man, the legend.
There he is.

701
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,369
No, no, no.
Next to him.

702
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,372
He look familiar to you?

703
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:38,809
What have we here?

704
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,412
[Hangman] Bradshaw.

705
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,114
As I live and breathe.

706
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,884
[Panting]

707
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,720
[Maverick]
Hey, Theo, you got big.

708
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,388
[Child] Hey, mav.

709
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,824
[Soft rock playing over jukebox]

710
00:44:58,729 --> 00:44:59,729
Amelia?

711
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,198
I know. I got big.

712
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:02,766
[Chuckles] Yes.

713
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,970
Bar opens at 5:00.

714
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,838
No, I just came by
to pay off a debt.

715
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:09,406
[Amelia] Mom!

716
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,847
Hey, how's your dad?
With his wife, in Hawaii.

717
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:18,515
Mom!

718
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,785
Mav says he owes you money.

719
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,189
Oh. Don't worry
about it. I insist.

720
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,825
[Sighs]

721
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31,896
Thank you, captain.
Consider your tab closed.

722
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,498
Captain? Still?

723
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,501
A highly decorated captain.

724
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:38,502
Finish up.

725
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:40,304
We have to get the boat
to the yard.

726
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,339
I can't go. What do
you mean, you can't go?

727
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:45,676
Test tomorrow. I have to
study. They only told us today.

728
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,912
Well, I can't sail her alone.

729
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,313
Just use the engine.

730
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,715
Why are we taking her
to the yard?

731
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,450
[Both] To fix the engine.

732
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,719
Mm-hmm.
I can help.

733
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,795
[Penny] Little rougher than I
was expecting. You don't say.

734
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,732
Pull on the back stay.
We'll de-power the sails.

735
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,167
Okay.

736
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,201
What does that mean?

737
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:15,438
You're supposed to be
in the Navy!

738
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:19,342
I don't sail boats, penny.
I land on them.

739
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:22,779
It's sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane.

740
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,480
So how do I do that?

741
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:27,216
[Chuckles] You pull on
that green line up there.

742
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,818
Green line.

743
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,588
Yep. Pull it hard.

744
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:35,792
Yep. Crank that winch
right there,

745
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,794
tighten the jib.

746
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,830
Crank it. You okay? Yeah.

747
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:43,433
Good.

748
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,635
Now,

749
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,304
you ready?

750
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:51,808
For what?

751
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,609
The afterburner.

752
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:15,732
Now you're in the Navy.

753
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,319
[Engine turns off]

754
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,822
Thanks for helping out today.

755
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:42,926
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

756
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:45,929
Hmm.

757
00:47:48,264 --> 00:47:49,799
Don't give me that look.

758
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,135
What look?

759
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:53,003
That one.

760
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,673
Good night, Pete.

761
00:47:58,274 --> 00:47:59,776
Night, penny.

762
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:09,452
[Exhales]

763
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,487
[Chuckles]

764
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:13,957
[Sighs]

765
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,094
[Amelia] Mom, is that you?

766
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,694
[Penny] Yeah, it's me.

767
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,165
I'll make you dinner.

768
00:48:21,297 --> 00:48:22,532
[Amelia] Okay.

769
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,872
Time is your greatest enemy.

770
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:34,243
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

771
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:35,912
attacking in two-plane teams.

772
00:48:36,045 --> 00:48:38,747
You'll fly along this narrow
canyon to your target.

773
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,350
Radar-guided surface-to-air
missiles defend the area.

774
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:45,087
These sams, they're lethal.

775
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:49,058
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

776
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,162
That's because the enemy knows no one
is insane enough to try and fly below them.

777
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:56,832
That's exactly what
I'm gonna train you to do.

778
00:48:56,966 --> 00:49:01,336
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

779
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:02,804
You exceed this altitude...

780
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,340
[Radar beeping]
Radar will spot you

781
00:49:05,473 --> 00:49:07,843
and you're dead.
[Beeping intensifies]

782
00:49:07,977 --> 00:49:10,378
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

783
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:12,013
minimum.

784
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:14,317
Time to target:
Two and a half minutes.

785
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:19,421
That's because fifth-generation
fighters wait at an air base nearby.

786
00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:23,859
In a head-to-head with these
planes in your f-18s, you're dead.

787
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:27,762
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

788
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,967
before these planes even
have a chance of catching you.

789
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,203
This makes time
your greatest adversary.

790
00:49:35,637 --> 00:49:39,674
<i>You'll fly a route in your nav
system that simulates the canyon.</i>

791
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:41,676
<i>The faster you navigate
this canyon,</i>

792
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,379
<i>the harder it'll be to stay under
the radar of these enemy sams.</i>

793
00:49:44,512 --> 00:49:46,481
[Grunting]
<i>The tighter the turns,</i>

794
00:49:46,615 --> 00:49:48,317
<i>the more intensely
the force of gravity</i>

795
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,385
<i>on your body multiplies...</i>
[Grunts]

796
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:52,054
<i>Compressing your lungs...</i>
[Exhales]

797
00:49:52,188 --> 00:49:54,623
<i>Forcing the blood from
your brain...</i> [Grunting]

798
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:56,893
<i>Impairing your judgment
and reaction time.</i>

799
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:59,461
So for today's lesson, we're
gonna take it easy on you.

800
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:02,831
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: Three minutes.

801
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:05,902
Good luck.

802
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:13,875
[Breathing heavily]

803
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,844
[Bob] Time to target
is one minute 30.

804
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:18,381
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

805
00:50:18,513 --> 00:50:19,949
We got to move, coyote.

806
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:22,285
Copy. Increasing speed.

807
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,685
Oh! [Grunts]

808
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:25,853
Oh, shit!

809
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:28,890
[Beeping]

810
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,192
Why are they dead?

811
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:33,296
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a Sam took us out.

812
00:50:33,428 --> 00:50:35,064
No. Why are they dead?

813
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:37,408
I slowed down and didn't give
her a warning. It was my fault.

814
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:40,512
Was there a reason you didn't communicate
with your team? I was focusing on...

815
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:43,305
One that their family
will accept at the funeral.

816
00:50:43,437 --> 00:50:44,638
None, sir.

817
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,999
Why didn't you
anticipate the turn?

818
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:48,609
You were briefed on the terrain.

819
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:51,947
Don't tell me.
Tell it to his family.

820
00:50:57,052 --> 00:50:59,620
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

821
00:50:59,753 --> 00:51:02,424
Negative, payback.
Increase your speed.

822
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:07,628
You're going too fast, man. No
harm in being ahead of schedule.

823
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:12,267
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

824
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,502
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

825
00:51:17,305 --> 00:51:18,706
[Radar beeping]

826
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:21,542
What happened? [Hangman]
I flew as fast as I could.

827
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:23,477
Kind of like my ass
depended on it.

828
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:27,215
And you put your team in danger,
and your wing man's dead.

829
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,018
They couldn't keep up.

830
00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:38,525
[Yale] <i>Rooster, we're 20
seconds behind and dropping.</i>

831
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:41,262
[Rooster]
We're fine. Speed is good.

832
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:43,031
Increase to 500 knots.

833
00:51:43,164 --> 00:51:45,866
Negative, Yale. Hold your
speed. [Yale] <i>Rooster, we're late!</i>

834
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:48,769
We're alive. We'll make
up time in the straightaway.

835
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:50,305
[Yale] <i>We are not gonna make it.</i>

836
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:53,574
Just trust me. Maintain
your speed. We can make it.

837
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:55,809
Why are you dead?

838
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:57,445
You're team leader up there.

839
00:51:57,578 --> 00:51:59,981
Why are you,
why is your team dead?

840
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:02,783
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

841
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:04,919
A minute late. [Sighs]

842
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:07,521
He gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down.

843
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:09,424
He is dead.
You don't know that.

844
00:52:09,556 --> 00:52:13,128
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

845
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:14,929
We made it to the target.

846
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:18,033
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

847
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:21,102
Then it's a dogfight. Against
fifth-generation fighters.

848
00:52:21,236 --> 00:52:23,837
[Rooster] Yeah. We'd still have
a chance. [Maverick] In an f-18.

849
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:26,508
It's not the plane, sir,
it's the pilot.

850
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,976
Exactly!

851
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:37,519
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

852
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:39,287
[Hangman]
You really don't get it.

853
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:43,291
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

854
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:45,326
or a man does not come back.

855
00:52:46,294 --> 00:52:47,728
No offense intended.

856
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:50,899
Yet somehow you always manage.

857
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,834
Look, I don't mean to criticize.

858
00:52:53,968 --> 00:52:55,803
You're conservative, that's all.
Lieutenant.

859
00:52:55,937 --> 00:53:00,840
We're going into combat, son, on
a level no living pilot's ever seen.

860
00:53:02,242 --> 00:53:03,576
Not even him.

861
00:53:05,145 --> 00:53:07,247
That's no time to be
thinking about the past.

862
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:12,852
What's that supposed
to mean? Rooster.

863
00:53:12,986 --> 00:53:15,697
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

864
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:18,358
That's enough. Or that Maverick
was flying when his old man...

865
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:20,961
Lieutenant, that's enough!
[All clamoring, shouting]

866
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:23,130
That's enough.
You son of a bitch!

867

01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,445
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

1043
01:07:38,578 --> 01:07:40,881
will be operational
earlier than expected.

1044
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,818
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

1045
01:07:44,953 --> 01:07:47,889
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

1046
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,458
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

1047
01:07:51,591 --> 01:07:54,594
Sir, no one here has successfully
flown a low-level course.

1048
01:07:54,728 --> 01:07:56,898
Nevertheless, you've
been ordered to move on.

1049
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,067
Captain.

1050
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:04,105
[Maverick] We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

1051
01:08:04,238 --> 01:08:06,107
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

1052
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,976
It's a pop-up strike
with a steep dive,

1053
01:08:08,109 --> 01:08:11,478
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

1054
01:08:12,447 --> 01:08:13,680
<i>Two pairs of f-18s will fly</i>

1055
01:08:13,814 --> 01:08:15,283
<i>in a welded wing formation.</i>

1056
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:19,187
<i>Teamwork. Precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential</i>

1057
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,023
<i>to both the mission's success
and your survival.</i>

1058
01:08:22,156 --> 01:08:24,858
As you know, the plant rests
between two mountains.

1059
01:08:24,993 --> 01:08:29,931
On final approach, you'll
invert directly into a steep dive.

1060
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,034
<i>This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude</i>

1061
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:36,037
<i>and the only possible
attack angle.</i>

1062
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:44,344
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

1063
01:08:44,478 --> 01:08:46,480
<i>The two-seat aircraft
will paint the target</i>

1064
01:08:46,612 --> 01:08:48,848
<i>with a laser bull's-eye.</i>
[Beeping]

1065
01:08:48,982 --> 01:08:50,816
The first pair
will breach the reactor

1066
01:08:50,951 --> 01:08:54,620
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

1067
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:57,656
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

1068
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:59,592
That's miracle number one.

1069
01:09:01,395 --> 01:09:04,431
<i>The second team
will deliver the kill shot...</i>

1070
01:09:04,563 --> 01:09:05,631
[Target lock beeps]

1071
01:09:05,765 --> 01:09:07,833
And destroy the target.

1072
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:10,303
That's miracle number two.

1073
01:09:11,604 --> 01:09:14,007
<i>If either team
misses the target...</i>

1074
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:18,378
That's a miss. [Maverick]
<i>The mission is a failure.</i>

1075
01:09:18,512 --> 01:09:19,779
Damn it!

1076
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:22,382
[Maverick] Egress
is a steep high-g climb out

1077
01:09:22,516 --> 01:09:24,184
to avoid hitting this mountain.

1078
01:09:26,286 --> 01:09:29,655
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling at least eight g's.

1079
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:31,124
Nine, minimum.

1080
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:33,960
The stress limit
of the f-18's airframe is 7.5.

1081
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:35,628
[Maverick]
That's the accepted limit.

1082
01:09:35,761 --> 01:09:37,830
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

1083
01:09:37,964 --> 01:09:40,901
even if it means
bending your airframe.

1084
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:45,205
<i>You'll be pulling so hard, you'll
weigh close to 2,000 pounds,</i>

1085
01:09:45,338 --> 01:09:47,974
<i>your skull crushing
your spine...</i> [Grunting]

1086
01:09:48,108 --> 01:09:51,311
<i>Your lungs imploding like an
elephant's sitting on your chest,</i>

1087
01:09:51,445 --> 01:09:55,115
<i>fighting with everything you
have just to keep from blacking out.</i>

1088
01:09:55,248 --> 01:09:56,917
[Grunting, gasping]

1089
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,886
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

1090
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:03,256
This is coffin corner.

1091
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,926
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

1092
01:10:06,059 --> 01:10:09,862
you'll climb straight up into enemy
radar while losing all of your airspeed.

1093
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:13,333
Within seconds, you'll be
fired upon by enemy sams.

1094
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:17,337
You've all faced sustained
g's before, but this...

1095
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:21,341
This is gonna take you and
your aircraft to the breaking point.

1096
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:24,211
Sir, is this even achievable?

1097
01:10:24,344 --> 01:10:26,213
The answer to that question

1098
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:28,881
will come down
to the pilot in the box.

1099
01:10:32,818 --> 01:10:35,055
[Sonic boom]

1100
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:40,427
Talk to me, Bob. We are
12 seconds late on target.

1101
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,463
We gotta move! We gotta
move! Copy. Try to stay with me.

1102
01:10:43,597 --> 01:10:46,366
[Radar beeping]

1103
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,935
Huh? Wait, who's that?

1104
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:51,414
[Maverick] <i>Blue team,</i>
<i>you've been spotted.</i>

1105
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:53,739
Shit, it's Maverick.
What the hell is he doing here?

1106
01:10:53,873 --> 01:10:57,144
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue team, what are you gonna do?

1107
01:10:57,277 --> 01:11:00,546
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

1108
01:11:00,678 --> 01:11:02,281
Your call.
What do you want to do?

1109
01:11:02,414 --> 01:11:05,117
Continue. We're close.
Stay on target.

1110
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:08,354
He's swinging around to the
north! Stand by for pop-up.

1111
01:11:08,487 --> 01:11:11,689
Be ready on that laser, Bob.
Copy. I'm on it.

1112
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,659
Blue team,
bandit is still closing.

1113
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:15,860
Popping now.

1114
01:11:15,995 --> 01:11:17,862
[Grunting, gasping]

1115

[Grunts]

1116
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:24,103
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

1117
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:26,704
He's five miles out.
He's coming fast.

1118
01:11:32,178 --> 01:11:35,314
Target's in sight.
Where's my laser, Bob?

1119
01:11:35,447 --> 01:11:38,884
Dead eye! Dead eye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

1120
01:11:39,018 --> 01:11:41,120
We're out of time.
I'm dropping blind.

1121

[Target lock beeps]
[Maverick] That's tone.

1125
01:11:58,304 --> 01:12:00,738
Maverick's got missile
lock on us. Shit! We're dead.

1126
01:12:01,507 --> 01:12:02,908

that this mission can be flown.

is teach them that it can't.

01:17:25,428 --> 01:17:27,264
Sir... that is all.

1208
01:17:45,481 --> 01:17:46,515
I heard.

1209
01:17:48,717 --> 01:17:50,085
I'm sorry.

1210
01:17:50,786 --> 01:17:52,521
What are you gonna do?

1211
01:17:53,622 --> 01:17:55,090
Ice is gone.

1212
01:17:57,293 --> 01:17:59,295
What choice do I have?

1213
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:02,831
You'll have to find a
way back on your own.

1214
01:18:02,966 --> 01:18:04,400
No, penny.

1215
01:18:06,002 --> 01:18:07,503
I'm out.

1216
01:18:09,071 --> 01:18:10,506
This is over.

1217
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:11,975
Pete.

1218
01:18:12,107 --> 01:18:14,476
If you lost
your wing man up there,

1219
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:16,845
you'd keep fighting.

1220
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,414
You wouldn't just give up.

1221
01:18:19,049 --> 01:18:21,250
Those are your pilots.

1222
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:25,055
If anything happens to them,

1223
01:18:25,187 --> 01:18:27,523
you'll never forgive yourself.

1224
01:18:31,327 --> 01:18:33,462
I don't know what to do.

1225
01:18:37,366 --> 01:18:39,134
But you'll find a way.

1226
01:18:41,236 --> 01:18:42,638
I know you will.

1227
01:18:44,573 --> 01:18:46,775
[Cyclone] <i>Captain Mitchell</i>
<i>is no longer your instructor.</i>

1228
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:50,112
And as of today, there are
new mission parameters.

1229
01:18:50,245 --> 01:18:52,615
Time to target is now
four minutes. [Beeps]

1230
01:18:52,748 --> 01:18:55,317
You'll be entering the
valley level at reduced speed.

1231
01:18:55,451 --> 01:18:58,153
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1232
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:00,991
Sir, won't we be giving
their planes time to intercept?

1233
01:19:01,123 --> 01:19:03,803
Well, lieutenant, you have a
fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1234
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:06,862
What are the odds of surviving a
head-on collision with a mountain?

1235
01:19:06,997 --> 01:19:09,732
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1236
01:19:09,865 --> 01:19:11,200
level with the north wall.

1237
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:13,435
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1238
01:19:13,569 --> 01:19:15,437
but you will avoid
the high-g climb out.

1239
01:19:15,571 --> 01:19:18,173
We'll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles.

1240

[Monitor beeping]

1241
01:19:23,278 --> 01:19:24,680

[Maverick] <i>Maverick to range

1243
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:31,186

for you, sir.</i>

1246
01:19:38,962 --> 01:19:40,930
[Maverick]
<i>Well, I'm going anyway.</i>

1247
01:19:41,064 --> 01:19:42,197
Nice.

1248
01:19:42,331 --> 01:19:44,100
<i>Setting time to target:</i>

1249
01:19:44,233 --> 01:19:46,036
<i>Two minutes 15 seconds.</i>

1250
01:19:46,168 --> 01:19:47,703
2:15? That's impossible.

1251
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:50,706

[Breathing heavily]

1268
01:22:38,172 --> 01:22:41,108
[Cyclone] You have put me
in a difficult position, captain.

1269
01:22:41,242 --> 01:22:44,979
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1270
01:22:45,112 --> 01:22:47,781
Perhaps the only way
it can be survived.

1271
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:50,284
On the other hand,

1272
01:22:50,417 --> 01:22:53,221
you did it by stealing a
multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1273
01:22:53,353 --> 01:22:56,690
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1274
01:22:57,791 --> 01:23:00,760
Iceman is no longer here
to protect you.

1275
01:23:00,895 --> 01:23:03,530
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1276
01:23:03,663 --> 01:23:05,699
and dishonorably discharged.

1277
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,834
So what do I do?

1278
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:09,769
Risk the lives of my pilots

1279
01:23:09,904 --> 01:23:11,939
and perhaps the success
of this mission

1280
01:23:13,307 --> 01:23:14,541
or...

1281
01:23:15,943 --> 01:23:17,544
Risk my career

1282
01:23:18,378 --> 01:23:20,413
by appointing you team leader?

1283
01:23:23,717 --> 01:23:28,455
Sir... I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, captain.

[Warlock] Captain Mitchell!

1288
01:25:22,435 --> 01:25:24,204
You're where you belong.

1289
01:25:29,109 --> 01:25:30,743
Make us proud.

1290
01:25:56,602 --> 01:25:58,938
It has been an honor
flying with you.

1291
01:25:59,939 --> 01:26:03,842
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1292
01:26:03,977 --> 01:26:07,280
This is a very specific mission.

1293
01:26:07,414 --> 01:26:10,783
My choice is a reflection
of that and nothing more.

1294
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:13,019
Choose your two foxtrot teams.

1295
01:26:14,454 --> 01:26:16,189
Payback and fanboy.

1296
01:26:17,223 --> 01:26:18,724
Phoenix and Bob.

1297
01:26:22,728 --> 01:26:24,730
[Cyclone] And your wing man.

1298
01:26:29,002 --> 01:26:30,036
Rooster.

1299
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,608
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1300
01:26:36,742 --> 01:26:39,879
for any reserve role
that's required.

1301
01:26:40,547 --> 01:26:41,915
Dismissed.

1302
01:26:49,321 --> 01:26:52,424
Your target
is a clear and present threat.

1303
01:26:53,724 --> 01:26:57,595
<i>A secret uranium enrichment
site under rogue state control.</i>

1304
01:26:57,728 --> 01:26:59,597
<i>It's an underground bunker,</i>

1305
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:01,799
tucked between
these two mountains.

1306
01:27:03,335 --> 01:27:06,704
<i>Your route of ingress is heavily
defended by surface-to-air missiles</i>

1307

<i>backed up
by fifth-generation fighters.</i>

1308
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:12,044
Once your f-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1309
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:14,113
tomahawk missiles
from the USS <i>Leyte Gulf</i>

1310
01:27:14,246 --> 01:27:18,150
will launch a synchronized
strike on the enemy's airfield here.

1311
01:27:19,184 --> 01:27:21,752
<i>This will knock out
their runway.</i>

1312
01:27:23,188 --> 01:27:26,425
<i>But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.</i>

1313
01:27:26,558 --> 01:27:29,861
The moment those tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1314
01:27:30,795 --> 01:27:31,997
Your time to target

1315
01:27:32,131 --> 01:27:35,067
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds.

1316
01:27:36,368 --> 01:27:38,303
<i>Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed</i>

1317
01:27:38,437 --> 01:27:41,373
<i>to any aircraft
the tomahawks may have missed.</i>

1318
01:27:44,443 --> 01:27:47,212

been training for.

01:45:02,672 --> 01:45:04,241
I shot down three migs
in one of those.

1552
01:45:04,375 --> 01:45:07,144
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1553
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,882
Let's find out.
Mav!

1554
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:14,784
Okay.

1555
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:23,860
[Alarm continues]
[Indistinct shouting]

1556
01:45:23,994 --> 01:45:27,097
There's guys up there, mav.
Yeah.

1557
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:30,201
[Rooster] There's more
over there. [Maverick] Okay.

1558
01:45:30,334 --> 01:45:32,937
[Maverick] Let's start running.
[Rooster] Yeah, run. Run.

1559
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:45,015
Once... once I give you
the signal for air,

1560
01:45:45,149 --> 01:45:47,784
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1561
01:45:47,918 --> 01:45:49,286
When the engine starts,

1562
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:51,721
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1563
01:45:51,854 --> 01:45:53,524
You understand?
Yeah.

1564
01:45:53,657 --> 01:45:55,593
[Powers up]

1565
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:56,961
Yes!

1566
01:45:58,629 --> 01:46:00,998
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1567
01:46:08,706 --> 01:46:10,975
Okay. Wow.

1568
01:46:11,875 --> 01:46:13,978
It's been a minute, huh, mav?

1569
01:46:15,879 --> 01:46:17,982
[Electronics beeping, whirring]

1570
01:46:26,657 --> 01:46:28,825
[Beeping]

1571
01:46:42,439 --> 01:46:45,842
Oh, my god.
This thing is so old.

1572
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:47,844
All right.

1573
01:46:52,683 --> 01:46:54,351
Canopy?
Clear.

1574
01:47:12,502 --> 01:47:14,836
Both runways are cratered.

1575
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:17,273
How we gonna get this
museum piece in the air?

1576
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:29,118
Why are the wings
coming out, mav?

1577
01:47:35,425 --> 01:47:38,127
Mav, this is a taxiway,
not a runway.

1578
01:47:38,261 --> 01:47:41,731
This is a very short
taxiway, mav.

1579
01:47:41,863 --> 01:47:43,266
Just hang on.

1580
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,035
Holy shit!

1581
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,009
Come on, come on, come on.

1582
01:47:53,142 --> 01:47:55,078
Needle's alive. Come on.

1583
01:47:57,513 --> 01:47:59,848
Mav?
That's it. Come on, come on!

1584
01:47:59,982 --> 01:48:01,250
All right.

1585
01:48:01,951 --> 01:48:04,187
Mav!
Here we go.

1586
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:07,090
Holy shit.

1587
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:23,673
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from rooster's esat.

1588
01:48:23,806 --> 01:48:25,675
But there seems to be
a malfunction.

1589
01:48:25,808 --> 01:48:27,310
Have you lost him?
No, sir.

1590
01:48:28,211 --> 01:48:29,645
He's supersonic.

1591
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:31,447
He's airborne.

1592
01:48:32,615 --> 01:48:34,517
In what?
Sir.

1593
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:39,255
Over watch reports an f-14 tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1594
01:48:39,989 --> 01:48:42,658
Can't be. It can't be!

1595
01:48:44,394 --> 01:48:45,428
Maverick.

1596
01:48:47,397 --> 01:48:49,799
Okay, rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1597
01:48:49,932 --> 01:48:51,401
I'm working on it.

1598
01:48:51,534 --> 01:48:54,637
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1599
01:48:54,771 --> 01:48:57,875
What do I do? Talk me
through it. Okay, first the radio.

1600
01:48:58,007 --> 01:48:59,877
Throw the, uh...

1601
01:49:00,009 --> 01:49:03,179
The uhf-2 circuit breaker.
Try that.

1602
01:49:03,312 --> 01:49:06,215
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1603
01:49:06,349 --> 01:49:08,451
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1604
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:10,186
I'll figure it out.

1605
01:49:13,222 --> 01:49:15,591
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1606
01:49:20,829 --> 01:49:22,164
What do we do?

1607
01:49:22,831 --> 01:49:24,699
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1608
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:27,502
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1609
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:31,006
Well, here they come.

1610
01:49:31,139 --> 01:49:34,443
What's your plan?
Just put your mask on.

1611
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:38,113
Remember,
we're on the same team.

1612
01:49:40,649 --> 01:49:42,517
Just wave and smile.

1613
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:44,719
<i>Just wave and smile.</i>

1614
01:49:51,593 --> 01:49:53,361
What's that signal?
What's he saying?

1615
01:49:53,495 --> 01:49:56,965
No idea.
I have no idea what he's saying.

1616
01:49:57,098 --> 01:50:01,036
[Rooster] What about that one? Any
idea? No, never seen that one either.

1617
01:50:03,873 --> 01:50:08,143
Oh, shit. His wing man is moving
into weapons envelope.

1618
01:50:08,777 --> 01:50:10,278
All right, listen up.

1619
01:50:10,412 --> 01:50:12,981
When I tell you, you grab
those rings above your head.

1620
01:50:13,114 --> 01:50:14,783
That's the ejection handle.

1621
01:50:15,717 --> 01:50:18,186
[Rooster]
<i>Mav, can we outrun these guys?</i>

1622
01:50:18,921 --> 01:50:21,056
Not their missiles and guns.

1623
01:50:25,293 --> 01:50:27,229
Then it's a dogfight.

1624
01:50:27,362 --> 01:50:30,465
An f-14 against
fifth-gen fighters?

1625
01:50:31,666 --> 01:50:34,269
It's not the plane,
it's the pilot.

1626
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:37,672
You'd go after 'em
if I wasn't here.

1627
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:40,175
But you are here.

1628
01:50:40,775 --> 01:50:42,277
Come on, mav.

1629
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:44,546
Don't think.

1630
01:50:45,714 --> 01:50:46,781
Just do.

1631
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:53,755
[Grunts]

1632
01:51:02,264 --> 01:51:04,466
Tell me when you see
smoke in the air.

1633
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,235
[Target lock beeps]

1634
01:51:08,537 --> 01:51:11,039
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air! Hang on.

1635
01:51:13,475 --> 01:51:16,311
Yeah, mav! Splash one!
Splash one!

1636
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:20,415
[Target lock beeps]

1637
01:51:21,349 --> 01:51:23,418
Here comes another one.
[Grunts]

1638
01:51:25,922 --> 01:51:28,189
Rooster, flares!
Now, now, now!

1639
01:51:31,293 --> 01:51:32,727
Splitting the throttles.

1640
01:51:34,828 --> 01:51:36,163
Coming around.

1641
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,913
Give me tone, give me tone.
[Target lock beeps]

1642
01:51:41,937 --> 01:51:44,538
You got him, mav! You
got him! Taking the shot.

1643
01:51:50,511 --> 01:51:51,745
What the...

1644
01:51:52,513 --> 01:51:54,848
Holy shit!
What the fuck was that?

1645
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:58,285
Hang on. We gotta get low.

1646
01:51:58,419 --> 01:52:01,088
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1647
01:52:02,958 --> 01:52:04,124
Here he comes!

1648
01:52:07,828 --> 01:52:09,797
[Beeping]

[Grunts]

1650
01:52:16,537 --> 01:52:18,405
Talk to me, rooster.
Where is he?

1651
01:52:18,539 --> 01:52:20,507
[Rooster] He's still on us!

1652
01:52:27,414 --> 01:52:29,717
We took a hit! We took a hit!
Damn it!

1653
01:52:34,555 --> 01:52:37,025
Come on, mav. Do some of
that pilot shit. Brace yourself.

1654
01:52:37,157 --> 01:52:38,659
[Grunts]

1655

1656
01:52:47,668 --> 01:52:48,736
Holy shit.

1657
01:52:55,542 --> 01:52:57,645
[Target lock beeping]
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1658
01:53:01,983 --> 01:53:03,417
Damn it!

1659
01:53:04,184 --> 01:53:07,187
Out of missiles.
Switching to guns.

1660
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:14,194
Come on, mav, come on.

1661
01:53:16,497 --> 01:53:18,432
You got him, mav!
It's not over yet.

1662
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:24,873
One last chance.
You can do this.

1663
01:53:25,974 --> 01:53:27,876
[Maverick] Come on, Maverick.

1664
01:53:31,245 --> 01:53:33,781
[Alarm blaring]

1665
01:53:37,217 --> 01:53:39,386
Yes! Splash two!

01:53:40,354 --> 01:53:43,190
[Breathes heavily]

1667
01:53:48,963 --> 01:53:50,064
[Beeping]

1668
01:53:50,196 --> 01:53:51,865
Mav, I got the radio on.
Outstanding.

1669
01:53:51,999 --> 01:53:54,068
Get us in touch with
the boat. Copy that.

1670
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,202
[Alarm blaring]

1671
01:53:56,335 --> 01:53:57,737
Oh, my god.

1672
01:53:59,505 --> 01:54:01,474
Where the hell is this guy?

1673
01:54:02,508 --> 01:54:04,410
He's on our nose.

1674
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:08,916
[Clicking]
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1675
01:54:10,783 --> 01:54:13,486
Smoke in the air!
Rooster, flares!

1676
01:54:15,889 --> 01:54:17,356
That was close.

1677
01:54:19,492 --> 01:54:21,661
We're out of flares, mav.

1678
01:54:25,598 --> 01:54:27,800
Shit, he's already on us.

1679
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:34,440
[Groans] This is not good.

1680
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:38,644
[Grunts, panting]

1681
01:54:42,348 --> 01:54:44,550
We took another hit!
No, no, no, no, no!

1682
01:54:49,156 --> 01:54:51,324
We can't take much more of this.

1683
01:54:51,457 --> 01:54:53,193
We can't outrun this guy.
We got to eject.

1684
01:54:53,326 --> 01:54:54,594
What?
We need altitude.

1685
01:54:54,727 --> 01:54:56,729
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1686
01:54:56,864 --> 01:54:59,032
Mav, wait! Rooster,
there's no other way.

1687
01:55:02,202 --> 01:55:03,603
Eject, eject, eject!

1688
01:55:03,736 --> 01:55:06,506
[Grunting] Rooster,
pull the handle! Eject!

1689
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:08,541
It's not working!

1690
01:55:15,281 --> 01:55:18,252
[Beeping]

1691
01:55:18,384 --> 01:55:21,621
Mav! [Breathing heavily]

1692
01:55:22,588 --> 01:55:24,290
[Whispers] I'm sorry.

1693
01:55:25,458 --> 01:55:27,293
I'm sorry, goose.

1694

[Target lock beeps]

1695
01:55:39,639 --> 01:55:41,440
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1696
01:55:41,574 --> 01:55:43,576
This is your savior speaking.

1697
01:55:43,709 --> 01:55:45,511
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,</i>

1698
01:55:45,645 --> 01:55:48,182
<i>return your tray tables to their
locked and upright positions...</i>

[Laughs]

1700
01:55:49,415 --> 01:55:51,851
<i>And prepare for landing.</i>

1701
01:55:54,087 --> 01:55:56,223
Hey, hangman, you look good.

1702
01:55:56,355 --> 01:55:59,859
I am good, rooster.
I'm very good.

1703
01:56:01,561 --> 01:56:03,529
<i>I'll see you back on deck.</i>

[Breathing heavily]

1705
01:56:25,017 --> 01:56:27,619
Maverick is downwind.
No front landing gear.

1706
01:56:27,752 --> 01:56:29,956
No tail hook. Pull the cable
and raise the barricade.

1707
01:56:30,089 --> 01:56:32,591
Foul deck! Foul deck!
Raise the barricade!

1708
01:56:33,425 --> 01:56:34,961
Go!

1709
01:56:57,149 --> 01:56:59,384
Please don't tell me
we lost an engine.

1710
01:56:59,517 --> 01:57:02,454
All right, I won't
tell you that. Okay.

1711
01:57:19,471 --> 01:57:21,140
[Panting]

1712
01:57:26,379 --> 01:57:27,445
You good?

1713
01:57:27,579 --> 01:57:29,547
Yeah. I'm good.

1714
01:57:31,918 --> 01:57:34,020
[Cheering]

1715
01:58:14,859 --> 01:58:17,696
Chalked yourself another
kill. That makes two.

1716
01:58:18,264 --> 01:58:19,464
Mav has five.

1717
01:58:19,597 --> 01:58:21,132
Makes him an ace.

Thank you for saving my life.

1721
01:59:00,005 --> 01:59:02,140
It's what my dad would've done.

Hey, mav.
