twenty bucks a ticket and why didn't he
put us on the comp list?

No, no, there's always a comp list.

can give him that much.

99

Actually, the only thing
I gotta give that guy is

100
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,849

Jesus Christ, not that it makes a
difference on the first fucking place.

114
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,562
Nothing ever changes, man.
Fifty years from
now we're all gonna be dead

115
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:49,925
and there'll be new people standing
here drinking beer, eating pizza,

116
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:51,686
bitching and moaning about the
price of Oreos,

117
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:53,680
and they won't even
know we were ever here.

118
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:56,260
And then fifty years after that those
suckers will be dust and bones

119
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:59,114
and there'll be all these generations
of suckers trying to figure out

120
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:02,941
what they're doing on this fucking
planet and they'll all be full of shit.

121
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,816
It's all so fucking futile.

122
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:06,364

123
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,595
what the fuck are you so fucking
upset about, fuckhead?

124
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:14,003

126
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:30,474

yesterday, bitch comes in,

127
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,457
orders a
twelve-inch pie with extra cheese.

128
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,433
So I ask her if she wanted me, like,
to carry that out to her car for her.

129
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:43,499
Bitch is obviously in
heat. "Yes, right away."

130
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:46,593
So I carry the pie out to her car. We
smoke a J.

131
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:49,918
She blows me. We eat the pizza,
I chase her with the beer.

two weeks ago

135

liar of liars. - And your mom.

137
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:14,760
- No, I'm here. Where are you?
- Where are you-hoo?

138
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:18,617
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck
with the guy. I want the tickets.

139
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:19,818
Stuck, who? What guy?

140
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:21,687
- Huh?
- Shut up! Aw...

141
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:28,389
Look, you can't be out here
all night tonight, okay?

142
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,111
Hey, we're just having a conversation.

143
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,409
This is private property, my friend.

144
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:38,880
Hey, don't tell us about private property.
This is America, my friend.

145
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:41,818
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay?
The customers complain.

146
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,983
- We're your customers. We're
not complaining. - Please!

147
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:10,261
You don't need to sit
next to me right now.

148
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:12,062
Who were you talking to?

149
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:14,381
Nobody. Sooze.

150
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,668
- Stuck with what guy?
- What?

151
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:21,289
You said you didn't want to get
stuck with some guy. What guy?

152
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,622
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh,

Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?

161
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:54,737
I don't know.

162
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:57,487
- Want a beer? Is Pony coming?
- No, thanks. I don't drink.

Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did
she talk to him?

Pony? What's a "pony"?

165
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:06,975
You mean that geek who played the folk
music at the senior prom?

166
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:09,969
What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?

167
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:14,671
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"?
Been on the road

168
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:18,301
opening for "Midnight Hore".
Stadiums, man.

169
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:20,932
Wait, so Pony's coming by here?

170
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:24,861
- Didn't you see their video on MTV?
- No, I shot my TV.

171
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:27,074
But, so, Pony's comin'
by here to the corner?

172
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,858
He's around and, you know,
maybe he's coming by.

173
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:34,689
Sooze told him to come by and hang
out, whatever. It's no big deal.

174
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,235
- Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
- Oh, no, you

175
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,803
wanted to get together
with your close friend,

176
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:42,087
Pony, the rockstar. I understand.
So you, do you, want us to, leave?

177
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:45,142
- No. We were just gonna go someplace
or something to... - We are?

178
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:47,872
Alright. She told him
to meet us here. Fuck.

179
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:51,754
- Pony's coming here to the corner?!
- Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.

180
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,566
Jeff, Jeff, if you
want to be alone with

181
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:55,616
Pony, you know, that's,
that's fine with us.

182
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,397
Sooze wants to see him.

183
00:14:57,498 --> 00:15:03,218
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I
gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.

184
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:06,869
- Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's
he coming? - Yeah, when's he coming?

185
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,225
I don't know. Later. I don't know.

186
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:13,704
- Yes!
- Oh, fuck...

187
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,861
- God, I haven't seen you all day.
- You could've come over.

188
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:30,981
I know, I know, I know.
Oh! Trim it!

189
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:33,528
- I hate that.
- Sorry.

190
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:36,177
- Let's go back to the van right now.
- No.

191
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:38,180
I'm not going to the
van, it's so gross.

192
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:42,304
- Come on. I'm doing
my performance right now.
- Okay, so maybe later.

193
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,086
Oh! Jesus!

194
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:49,387
Fuck Oliver Stone.

195
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,687
Fuck Bill Clinton.

196
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:53,900
Fuck Howard Stern.

197
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:55,524
Fuck Michael Bolton.

198
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:57,410
Fuck O.J. Simpson.

199
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:59,152
Fuck Pope John Paul.

200
00:15:59,176 --> 00:16:00,676
Fuck my dad.

201
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,224
Fuck all the men.

202
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:05,248
Fuck all the men!

203
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:18,769
Bang your head, blow your nose.

204
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,942
Run down the street, suck a hose.

205
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,019
Chew my lips, eat some shit.

206
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:29,234
Eat a stick of dynamite and
blow yourself to bits.

207
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:35,026
Shut your mouth, go away.
Drink my piss, have a nice day!

208
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:40,373
I hope you cry and never doubt.
I hope you die with blood in your mouth.

209
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:45,873
I hope your lies will no more shout
What's in my eyes, what's in your snout.

210
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:52,529
You’re a pig! I know that's true!
I dance a jig! Fuck you!

211
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:55,363
Fuck you! Fuck you!

212
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,878
Fuck you!

213
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:10,331
That was really great.

214
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:11,631
- Was it okay?
- Yeah!

215
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:14,965
- What did you guys think?
- Slides go with it.

216
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:17,723
Behind me. I'm making
these slides out of

217
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:20,459
these old pictures and
paintings and stuff.

218
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,487
Was that supposed to be me?

219
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:23,936
No.

220
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:25,246
Yes.

221
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,671
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One

222
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,517
The Dialectical Expression
of Testosterone."

223
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,338
Isn't that a great title?

224
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,618
Why is everything about you, Jeff?

225
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,435
No, not, not everything.
This. I am the man in your life.

226
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:41,563
Man?

227
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:45,836
Yeah, man, male, significant
other, whatever the fuck I am.

228
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,335
It's a piece.

229
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,653
You’re sure as hell right about that.

230
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:52,310
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff.

231
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,533
It's just part of my application
to the School of Visual Arts

232
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,903
...in New York.

233
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:58,728
Ah, you know people there?

234
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:03,622
I'm just gonna go. I figure the
worst I can do is starve to death.

235
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:06,660
"The worst I can do is starve
to death." Listen to you.

236
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:09,780
- I don't want to hear it anymore.
- No, no, no. Y-you know what?

237
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,832
Y-you’re packing your bags,
you're jumping into

238
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:13,906
the unknown because
some conceptual artist

239
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:16,927
who teaches at a community college
is having a mid-life crisis

240
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:19,507
and he wants to sleep with
some girl half his age,

241
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:21,208
so he tells you you have talent.

242
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,526
Mister Brooks has had
shows in New York, Jeff.

243
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,265
He's been reviewed
in Art Forum. I think he knows.

244
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,271
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.

245
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:30,072
Well, fuck!

246
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:35,330
Might as well not do anything! Let's just
stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.

247
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,643
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey?
You should go to New York.

248
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:43,327
You should go. Go show 'em. They
need your unique point of view.

249
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:45,353
At least I have a point of view, you know?

250
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:48,873
I stand for something. And I'm
trying to communicate something.

251
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:51,541
What are you trying to communicate?
Tell us.

252
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:53,672
So you can give me more shit?

253
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:56,849
No, no. It's an honest question.
What are you trying to communicate?

254
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:59,034
I'm trying to communicate
how I feel, Jeff.

255
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:02,330
You know raise consciousness.
Make people think for a change.

256
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:05,416
"Burger Manifesto, Part One"
is gonna make people think?

257
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,950
- Yes, you asshole.
- About what?

258
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:10,057
- About things that are important to me.
- Like what?

259
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:15,790
Sexual politics, racism, the
environment, the military industrial...

260
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,945
Wait. Racism? You don't
know anybody who's black!

261
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,848
- Of course I do!
- Name one.

262
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,824
- God, Karen Johnson.
- One!

263
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:30,736
You’re completely missing the point.
I'm talking about idealism.

264
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,263
- Responsibility, progress.
- Yes.

265
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:35,222
No, idealism is guilty,
middle class bullshit.

266
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:37,035
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.

267
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,384
- No, no, no. I'm not
being cynical, I'm being

268
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:39,756
honest. - But do you
stand for anything?

269
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:41,658
- Yes, I stand for...
- What? What do you stand for?

270
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,621
I stand for honesty! I stand
for some level of truth!

271
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:47,699
- Oh, yeah, right. Fuck you.
- Can I talk here? Let me talk.

272
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,301
You know, all you know
is what's good for you.

273
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:50,302
- Can I talk?
- Typical male.

274
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,642
- Typical male.
- Typical male.

275
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:56,778
Tim, he listens to you. Do you
think it's a good idea? Seriously?

276
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,038
Seriously?

277
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:02,039
It's a great idea.

278
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,657
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.

279
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:09,729
I did. I split, man.

280
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:14,936
I expanded my horizons, you know.
Served my country.

281
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,076
Saw the world, you know?

282
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:21,307
I've gained wisdom and now I'm
back, baby,

283
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:24,210
back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.

284
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,711
I can't wait till Pony
gets here, you know?

285
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:28,973
Have a conversation
with a human being?

286
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,492
Well, if you love him so much,
why didn't you go see him play?

287
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,679
Um, because you didn't want to go.

288
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:37,880
Like I'm going to pay twenty
bucks to see Neil Moynihan

289
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,780
in some
band that I helped start.

290
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,415
Okay. Well, you know, he's always
been a nice guy and I like him.

291
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,916
He's a geek.

292
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:48,485
Hey, I've been, uh, making
these tapes, videotapes.

293
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:50,867
I ripped off
a camcorder up at the mall.

294
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:55,579
I thought, you know, it could be something
that I do, be a video artist, you know.

295
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,130
Ladies and gentlemen, Buff,
the postmodern idiot savant.

296
00:20:59,131 --> 00:21:00,825
He will outdo us all.

297
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,539
It's safe, come on.

298
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,177
That's it.

299
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,409
That's it! I'm calling the police.

300
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,296
Why we're just standing here.

301
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,947
- Look, you’re trespassing.
- Hey, call the cops!

302
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:31,915
Call 'em, call 'em right now, man.
Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up.

303
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,755
He'll definitely take your word over mine.
You can tell him about the trespassing.

304
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:37,619
I'll tell him about
how you sell beer to minors.

305
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,732
I'm not joking around now, okay?
Come on, let's go, let's go!

306
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,915
- We're just standing here!
- Just go and stand someplace else, okay?

307
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:47,424
You stand someplace else, man. You stand
someplace else. This is our corner.

308
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,810
You don't fucking own it!

309
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:52,970
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours.
You don't belong here.

310
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:56,482
No, you don't belong here.
We were here before you.

311
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:00,357
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

312
00:22:00,513 --> 00:22:01,258
Hey, Tim.

313
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:03,776
No, see, sweetheart, you don't
want to stand up for parasite

314
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:06,182
'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here.

315
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:08,569
You know what? Tow
words, man: roll on.

316
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,156
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, what are you, huh?
You fucking drunk bum.

317
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:13,010
Yeah, you good-for-nothing.

318
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:16,117
You just, uh, hang around. On my
property.

319
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:19,826
The Hare Krishna's calling me a drunk.

320
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,437
Hey, listen, pal, you want
us to go?

321
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:24,324
Yeah, please, go. Come on.

322
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,337
Make a move.

323
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,395
Greasecake.

324
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:39,126
- Towel-head.
- Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.

325
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,535
- Fucking drunk, huh?
- You have the largest penis.

326
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:43,508
- Can we go please?
- Don't let 'em fight.

327
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:45,834
- The dude wants it.
- This is ridiculous!

328
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,683
Pakeesa?

329
00:22:56,926 --> 00:23:04,169
It's okay. Come on. It's okay.

330
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,277
Come on, they're just
joking around.

331
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:30,333
Yeah, we're just screwing around.
Like Mohammed said.

332
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,685
Can't take a joke, man?

333
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,879
Hey, I hope you got a
permit for that, mama!

334
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,881
We're sorry, okay? We're gonna go.

335
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:42,049
Hey, you’re gonna regret this.

336
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,592
Come on, Jeff.

337
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,316
- Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
- Jeff! Let's go!

338
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:50,379
Hey, I'm sorry about that. It
was just a misunderstanding.

339
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,992
He was upset about something and he
took it out on you and I'm sorry. 'Bye.

340
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,300
No, I seriously doubt that
Pony's gonna be in a limo.

341
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,713
- That's the rock star thing.
- No, no.

342
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,866
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him
right out of a triple-x video.

343
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:20,267
- Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to
me! Stud! Oh! - Buff, Buff, Buff...

344
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:23,200
- Sorry.
- Jesus Christ.

345
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,986
- You wanna bet he's with a girl?
- No, he's not with a girl.

346
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:31,841
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God!
Pony, it's so huge!

347
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,841
You know what? He probably
gets bored with all that shit.

348
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:41,622
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um,
how do you figure that?

349
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,649
- I'd get bored.
- I wouldn't.

350
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,102
If I were in his shoes, every
morning I'd get up singing, man.

351
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:52,421
Do my work-out, take a shower,
followed by a hearty breakfast,

352
00:24:52,422 --> 00:24:55,523
steak and eggs, washed down
with a pot of hot coffee,

353
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,337
six pack of Coors Lite.

354
00:24:57,628 --> 00:25:01,290
Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my
babe,

355
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:05,504
who would appear decked out
in her all-black leather

356
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,951
Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit.

357
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:12,838
So I'd, like, have to chew
off all her clothes until

358
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,673
she was completely nude.

359
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,153
Except she'd have these amazing
dragon tattoos all over her body

360
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:25,305
and pierced nipples with little
gold peace signs hanging from 'em.

361
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:30,369
And then she'd take out this half-ounce
of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines,

362
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,520
vaporize a few million brain
cells, screw for about an hour,

363
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:37,835
then spend the rest of the
morning trashed watching...

364
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,226
- ...Gilligan.
- That sounds so great, man.

365
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:45,948
Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in
the afternoon?

366
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,844
Same, more of the same. Yep,
just keep doing the same

367
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:51,366
thing all the time, around
and around the clock.

368
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:54,365
With an occasional burger
or slice of thrown in

369
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,142
for our vitamins and energy.

370
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:09,014
Then, instead
of watching Gilligan,

371
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,271
we'd watch Captain Kirk.

372
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:16,045
- That sounds so depressing. - Oh, come
on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!

373
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:18,104
- No, I'm not saying that
I wouldn't love it. - Ah!

374
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:20,576
I'm saying no, I'm saying
after a while it'd wear thin.

375
00:26:20,577 --> 00:26:22,206
Yeah, a long while.

376
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:24,535
- A long, long while.
- Watch out for that tree.

377
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,724
- A long, long, long, long, while.
- Okay, okay.

378
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:29,692
- A long, long, long...
- Okay.

379
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:31,787
Hey, Tim! Hold up.

380
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:41,684
It was a racial incident.

381
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,816
It was just something that got
out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?

382
00:26:44,817 --> 00:26:45,887
It got that close.

383
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,734
Okay, but nothing happened.

384
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:49,833
Believe me, if I thought
something really bad

385
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,955
was going to happen, I
would've done something.

386
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,997
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

387
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:57,038
Okay, what would you have done?

388
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:05,249
- I would've stopped it.
- How?

389
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:09,867
I don't know. I would've done something.
This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it?

390
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:16,450
This place is so stupid. I can't believe
we're sitting here

391
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:18,434
in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all
these people

392
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:19,943
- eating their chunks of dead flesh...
- Jeff.

393
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:21,544
- ...like fucking robots.
- Jeff

394
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:24,905
Look at those kids there.

395
00:27:29,284 --> 00:27:33,601
You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks
yesterday. He has this friend in New York

396
00:27:33,926 --> 00:27:37,203
who wants to sublet his apartment for
six-fifty a month.

397
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:42,337
I could swing that. Six-fifty.

398
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:43,944
- Sooze.
- What?

399
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:46,529
Did it ever occur to
you that I might have

400
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,736
some feelings about you
moving to New York?

401
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:50,210
What feelings?

402
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,844
Us.

403
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,560
Of course.

404
00:27:55,944 --> 00:27:57,125
And?

405
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:03,004
Come with me.

406
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:04,473
No.

407
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:09,590
No, see, that's not what I'm saying.
I could go to New York if I wanted to,

408
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:13,608
but what's the point? So I can
learn how to order a cappuccino?

409
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,229
So I can get mugged by some crackhead?

410
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,862
- So I can see, see
homeless people up close

411
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:21,242
and personal? - So
what do you wanna do?

412
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Nothing.

413
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:25,781
No one does nothing, Jeff.

414
00:28:29,423 --> 00:28:31,835
Okay, well, then, I'm
gonna break new ground.

415
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:34,078
- New ground?
- Mm-hm.

416
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:37,999
Taking one community college course
on the history of Nicaragua,

417
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,451
while barely holding a job packing boxes?

418
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:44,690
Okay, look. My job is not who I am.
I don't need that.

419
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:47,864
Why?
What's your goal? Status? Money?

420
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:50,620
Getting your picture on the
cover of some glossy magazine?

421
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:52,366
My goal is to make art.

422
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:55,522
So, what, why can't you do that here?
What's wrong with here?

423
00:28:55,653 --> 00:28:57,028
Why is somewhere else better?

424
00:28:57,086 --> 00:28:59,434
Why should I stay here, Jeff?

425
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:03,212
So we can sit on the corner and
watch the lights change,

426
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:05,506
while you bitch about Burnfield?

427
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:08,186
So I can spend the rest
of my life guessing

428
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:11,194
- what it would be like to be
a real artist? - Oh, no.

429
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:14,941
So you and I can fuck while your parents
are out having dinner at the Sizzler?

430
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,543
What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?

431
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,066
I don't know.

432
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:45,760
Hey, great game Friday.
Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?

433
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:48,773
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?

434
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:52,382
- Just one?
- Yeah.

435
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:59,137
You seen the new guy we got? Beavers?

436
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:01,959
The guy can pass.

437
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:09,319
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. Do you
remember that game against North Reading?

438
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:12,867
When you passed to Pierce and he dropped
the ball? What do you think happened?

439
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:16,316
Do you think, like, he wasn't there or
were you short?

440
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:21,015
- I don't, I don't remember. What do
I owe you? - Uh, eleven twenty-five.

441
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:30,309
<i>"In my head I'm really tall."</i>

442
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,365
<i>"My arms are big, not small."</i>

443
00:31:34,985 --> 00:31:38,253
<i>"My hair is dark, on my back."</i>

444
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:42,340
<i>"Down straight, don't look back."</i>

445
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:46,619
<i>"In my heart, I am a star."</i>

446
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:49,329
<i>"Bigger than a guitar."</i>

447
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:52,804
- Hey.
- Hey. Do you have a cigarette?

448
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,767
No I quit.

449
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:00,386
- Hey, you said you did a video?
- Yup.

450
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:02,833
What's it about?

451
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:08,531
It's really not about anything.

452
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,343
Oh. Well, what's it on?

453
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:14,517
A cloud.

454
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:16,758
A cloud?

455
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:18,366
Yeah.

456
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,967
There was this cloud and I video taped it.

457
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:31,729
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud.
It looks excellent on tape.

458
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:40,113
The video is like my head and,
and everything, you know, is, like,

459
00:32:40,268 --> 00:32:42,616
is like in there that I see.

460
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,022
You know?

461
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:50,723
Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night
and walk around inside the Circle A

462
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:53,829
- with the camera and tape shit.
- Oh, that's so amazing.

463
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:58,038
- I wish I could see it.
- You can see it.

464
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:02,248
Whenever you want.

465
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,851
Don't you, um, work at a
hospital or something?

466
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:19,447
- Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
- You're a nurse?

467
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:22,746
No, I, you know, I help 'em out.
I empty bedpans

468
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:25,667
and bring 'em lunch.
That kind of thing.

469
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:27,525
Any gunshot victims?

470
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:32,432
Oh, some of 'em. But it's
mostly just strokes and shit.

471
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:36,053
I mean, most of 'em just sleep all
the time and get kind of yellow.

472
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,960
Usually they die id they're,
you know, really yellow.

473
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:41,802
Sounds like a bummer.

474
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:45,996
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're
not all totally in a coma.

475
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,992
I mean, they know when I'm helping them.

476
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:01,335
- Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
- Right now?

477
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:02,996
Yeah.

478
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:05,624
I don't know.

479
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,197
Waiting, I guess. You know?

480
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:24,259
Do you wanna go to the van?

481
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:30,832
Now?

482
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:35,525
Yeah, we could hang out and
smoke a dube, you know?

483
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:41,679
I don't smoke dubes and I
don't really hang out.

484
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:52,327
But I'll go back. Okay.

485
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:58,046
Okay, whatever you want.

486
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:15,907
Shit.

487
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:23,543
Hey, Pony.

488
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:26,035
Hey, man.

489
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:31,152
Jeff.

490
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:39,823
How're you doin?

491
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:43,247
- Good, man.
- Wow, man.

492
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:47,784
The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.

493
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:55,788
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone
for a year, man, Is that your limo?

494
00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:01,563
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company,
they make me use it, you know.

495
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,726
- I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
- No, it's not...

496
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:08,251
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol.
Wow, huh?

497
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:16,723
Yeah, hey I saw your album
at Musicland up at the mall.

498
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:20,783
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good
placement and shit like that, you know.

499
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:25,196
We sold, uh, over ninety
thousand units and uh...

500
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:29,131
and Danny says that we're
gonna get a gold record.

501
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:36,718
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great.
So you're,

502
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,997
you're like living the
wild life now, huh?

503
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:42,281
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

504
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:46,361
Aw, come on. Rock star.
Fame. Fortune. Sex.

505
00:37:51,512 --> 00:37:54,938
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know.
It's hard work, you know?

506
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:58,971
The road's hell, you know? I
mean airport, hotel, show.

507
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:02,844
And airport, hotel, show.
Airport, hotel, show. I mean,

508
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:09,143
fuck, man, you know?
You still living at your mom's?

509
00:38:10,576 --> 00:38:13,199
- Yeah, I crash there.
- Yeah, good.

510
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,211
Yeah, most nights I'm just
sleeping on the couch.

511
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:19,004
Yeah, that sounds cool. Great.

512
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:22,456
He says we got to be at the radio station
at seven a.m. Can you handle that?

513
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:25,427
- Oh, sure.
- Hi. I'm Erica.

514
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:27,975
- Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
- Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.

515
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:32,243
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so
amazing to be back home.

516
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:33,044
Oh, wow.

517
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:35,762
I mean, we've been playing
big places everywhere,

518
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:40,067
but when we did that sound check at
The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me.

519
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,428
I'm playing
The Orpheum, you know?

520
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:48,337
I mean, the last time I played here was,
uh, the prom.

521
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:52,248
The prom. That's funny.

522
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,696
Hey, I though you guys were
coming to the show, man?

523
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,591
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh,
Sooze, screwed up the tickets.

524
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:03,377
- Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
- Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.

525
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:06,652
- We were? - Oh, yeah, it was
a great show. You guys missed it.

526
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:10,025
- Sorry.
- So how's college?

527
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:14,316
I dropped out. I mean, uh,
you know, this semester I'm

528
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:17,401
taking a, a class, you know,
three nights a week.

529
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:23,098
But I'm just try-trying
to think and work on stuff, you know?

530
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:28,657
I've been doing some
writing, though. Short pieces, you know.

531
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:33,757
I love writing. A-Anne Rice?
I love Anne Rice.

532
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:39,554
Short pieces, huh? You
should try to write songs.

533
00:39:39,555 --> 00:39:41,434
You know, I've thought
about that, actually.

534
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,336
No, man, I mean it.
You're a good writer.

535
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:48,432
I remember those things you'd write
during honors English. Funny shit.

536
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,456
He wrote this thing
about his dick once and

537
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:55,634
he read it in front
of the whole class.

538
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,780
- I'd love to read that.
- Funny shit, man.

539
00:40:02,772 --> 00:40:05,930
- So you think I should?
- What?

540
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,504
Write. 'Cause I, I have
written some things.

541
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:15,605
- Like songs?
- Yeah, they could be songs.

542
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:20,394
- Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
- Really?

543
00:40:20,748 --> 00:40:23,132
- Yeah, really.
- Now?

544
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:25,578
- Yeah.
- Great.

545
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:26,779
Yeah, maybe later.

546
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:40,979
- Hey! Hey!
- Pony, oh my god! You showed up.

547
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:45,201
Holy shit! Look at this car, man!

548
00:40:45,202 --> 00:40:47,896
- Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
- Is that your driver?

549
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,796
- It's stupid.
- No, no, it isn't. It's cool.

550
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:50,797
Look at you!

551
00:40:52,893 --> 00:40:56,200
Hey, you look good. Like you,
you know, head's in a good

552
00:40:56,212 --> 00:40:59,530
place, you know? You, are
still doing your painting?

553
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:02,607
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I
started to do performances.

554
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:04,015
Oh, yeah?

555
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,635
So? What's L.A. like?

556
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:09,031
- It's pretty exciting.
- Yeah?

557
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:11,473
- Yeah.
- Like?

558
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:17,763
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager
Danny took us to this restaurant

559
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:21,824
- and there was Sandra Bernhard.
- No, she was just sitting there?!

560
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:24,464
Oh, yeah, just sitting there
eatin' a salad, you know.

561
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:26,926
That kind of thing happens
all the time in L.A.

562
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,964
It's, you know... I met
Johnny Depp.

563
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:34,306
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know,
I'm thinking of moving to New York.

564
00:41:34,478 --> 00:41:39,372
- New York, huh? - Yeah. To go to school
and, you know, paint, performances, paint.

565
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:43,797
You have to go. You always did
such, uh, you know, great work.

566
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:49,761
I still have some of those drawings
that you'd do in study hall.

567
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:51,809
- You do not!
- I do.

568
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,620
Jeff, don't you think Sooze should
go to New York and, uh, you know.

569
00:41:56,837 --> 00:42:01,018
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah.
She should.

570
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:12,183
Hey, yes!

571
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:17,409
Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!

572
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,386
- Oh, you were there?
- No, but I heard it was great.

573
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:24,016
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.
- Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.

574
00:42:24,017 --> 00:42:26,278
- Hi.
- How're you doing? Nice to meet you.

575
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:32,916
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin'
hotel rooms, babes around the clock?

576
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:35,334
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.

577
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:42,349
- Oh, So what about her? - Oh, uh, Erica?
Erica is the publicist for the band.

578
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,822
- Hi, I'm Erica.
- Hey, I'm Sooze.

579
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:46,452
- Yeah, right, publicist.
- Nice to meet you Sooze.

580
00:42:46,553 --> 00:42:48,538
Yeah, she, uh, works for the
record company and takes

581
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,546
care of interviews and,
you know, shit like that,

582
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:52,833
Uh, we were actually
just doin' an interview

583
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:55,482
and Erica said she's like to see
Burnfield, so...

584
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,682
So, do you guys want to do something,
go someplace or something like that?

585
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:06,161
So, we're all old friends of Pony's.
We go way back to our childhood.

586
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:11,749
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield.
We all hear about Burnfield.

587
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:17,181
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how,
uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?

588
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:18,816
- Oh, you were in the band?
- Yeah.

589
00:43:18,817 --> 00:43:23,777
- Well, I helped start it, but, you
know, uh... - Well, not exactly.

590
00:43:25,391 --> 00:43:26,969
For a while.

591
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:32,506
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times.
You know, I mean, you play harmonica,

592
00:43:32,507 --> 00:43:36,542
but that was before we were really a
band, you know, before Danny signed us.

593
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:39,767
Yeah, well, I, I came by
more than a couple times.

594
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:52,079
So you came by to see how
the other half lives,

595
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:56,117
huh? Well, here we are,
What do you think?

596
00:43:56,776 --> 00:43:58,965
Pretty fucking pathetic huh?

597
00:43:58,966 --> 00:44:02,027
Kind of like one of those
documentaries on educational TV?

598
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:04,132
It's nice here. It's different.

599
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:07,798
Yeah, totally.
So, uh, what do they interview you about?

600
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:13,660
Well, uh, there's this benefit
for Rwanda we're gonna do. And,

601
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,050
uh, you know, my songs,
uh, where I get the

602
00:44:17,062 --> 00:44:19,513
ideas for them, uh, you
know, stuff like that.

603
00:44:20,384 --> 00:44:22,968
- Where do you get your ideas?
- Leave him alone, Tim

604
00:44:23,198 --> 00:44:25,853
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to
know where he gets his ideas.

605
00:44:25,854 --> 00:44:29,171
Tim's jealous, you know? He
wants to have ideas too.

606
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:30,669
Yeah.

607
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:34,420
Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots
who are named after animals.

608
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,621
Jeff!

609
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:41,239
- You're not his publicist?
- Sure I am. It's fun.

610
00:44:41,483 --> 00:44:44,784
- Mm. And you’re like, what else?
- What do you mean? His girlfriend?

611
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:47,776
- Well, that's one way of putting it.
- Am I fucking him?

612
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,287
- Shit. - Pony, what would
you say our relationship is?

613
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:55,321
Um, mother-daughter.

614
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,561
- Pony and I are friends.
- So, then, you're, like, available?

615
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,454
In what way?

616
00:45:01,854 --> 00:45:03,188
Mm, in a horizontal

617
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:06,389
- and wet way!
- Ew! Oh, Buff!

618
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:08,650
Relax!

619
00:45:08,677 --> 00:45:11,517
Why don't you fucking relax? He's
having verbal intercourse, Sooze.

620
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:15,560
No, he's not. He's objectifying her and
he's entertaining us at her expense.

621
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:16,962
Oh, it's okay. What's your name?

622
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:18,753
- Buff.
- Buff is funny. God.

623
00:45:18,754 --> 00:45:20,800
Buff is funny, okay?
She likes Buff, so why

624
00:45:20,812 --> 00:45:22,870
don't you whip shut
the feminist hole.

625
00:45:22,872 --> 00:45:25,323
Hey, why don't you swallow
your cock and choke

626
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:27,798
on it? Oh, I forgot,
it's not big enough.

627
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:32,937
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are
you staying at your mother's house?

628
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:37,130
No, no, they, uh, you know, that
can be kind of a hassle, so,

629
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:40,684
uh, you know, I just stay at
the Four Seasons. It's easier.

630
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:44,748
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the
Four Seas, it's ease.

631
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:54,662
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.

632
00:45:55,724 --> 00:45:59,814
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you
know, it's a bed and hot water.

633
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:01,104
It does look good.

634
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:04,333
Yeah, so what do you guys do next?
I mean, what's your band do now?

635
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:09,527
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio
and we're, we're doin' a new album.

636
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:12,109
- Yeah?
- Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze,

637
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:14,042
you could do the cover.

638
00:46:15,517 --> 00:46:19,599
- You do not want me to do your cover.
- I don't want you to do the cover,

639
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:22,438
- I need you to do the cover.
- You're not serious.

640
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:27,282
- I'm always serious.
- Oh they'd never let me do what I want.

641
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:30,473
- I get final approval. It's in
my contract. - Would I get paid?

642
00:46:30,474 --> 00:46:33,791
- Yeah, we'd have to fly you out
for meetings, you know. - Yeah?

643
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:37,074
Oh, God, that would be
something I really want to do.

644
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,271
- Hey, can you cash this?
- Yeah.

645
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:57,953
- Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
- It's not the air force anymore, Scuff

646
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:02,448
- So where are you?
- I'm here.

647
00:47:13,775 --> 00:47:16,910
- Yeah man, your band is really cool.
- It's really great.

648
00:47:18,258 --> 00:47:20,278
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay?

649
00:47:31,379 --> 00:47:38,435
Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good
'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man.

650
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:43,564
You know? I mean, I forgot
what it was like to just hang out.

651
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:47,877
And you know why it's so good?
See, because,

652
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:50,243
see, you guys are real.
No, man, I mean it.

653
00:47:50,908 --> 00:47:53,351
You guys have a sense of humor.
You live

654
00:47:53,363 --> 00:47:55,818
your lives, you know.
It's simple, you know.

655
00:47:56,795 --> 00:48:02,121
The guys on the road, I mean, the band,
all they talk about is scoring chicks...

656
00:48:03,272 --> 00:48:05,361
and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.

657
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:07,715
Yeah, we're all above that.

658
00:48:09,984 --> 00:48:12,706
See, I wrote something about all this.

659
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,849
- Uh, it, it's a song about...
- Well, play it, man.

660
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,125
- Yeah, come on, play it.
- Oh, no, man. I can't.

661
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,600
- Play it! Come on!
- No, no, no, no, no, it's new.

662
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,201
- Please.
- I just started it.

663
00:48:26,202 --> 00:48:28,644
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it.
I'm gonna drop it. I'm...

664
00:48:28,745 --> 00:48:30,980
Don't drop the guitar, man.
No, no, whoa!

665
00:48:30,981 --> 00:48:33,459
Yes! Free concert!

666
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:36,771

- Alright, alright.

- It's coming along.
- Thank you.

679
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:37,163
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in
your song, man. That's important.

680
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:38,556
Hey, thanks, man.

681
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:42,471
So who are you?

682
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,376
What do you mean?

683
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,040
Well, if we're, like, the man
invisible, what are you?

684
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:52,891
I don't know.

685
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:58,583
I'm an artist, I guess. You
know, there's life and then

686
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:01,873
there's the people watching
the life, commenting on it.

687
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:05,953
- Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
- What?

688
00:51:07,104 --> 00:51:11,640
Comment, say things, think. Whatever.
Why are you so special?

689
00:51:12,273 --> 00:51:15,812
Well, I, I didn't say I was special,
but it's one thing, you know,

690
00:51:15,813 --> 00:51:17,926
and it's another thing
to actually communicate

691
00:51:17,938 --> 00:51:20,062
it to people. You
know what I mean?

692
00:51:20,063 --> 00:51:24,865
If a tree falls in a forest and no
one hears it, does that make a sound?

693
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:27,827
- Of course it does.
- You know, that is my worst fear.

694
00:51:28,028 --> 00:51:30,906
- Making a sound and no one hears it.
- Mine too.

695
00:51:31,076 --> 00:51:33,920
- W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
- You know what I'm saying?

696
00:51:33,944 --> 00:51:36,653
- Sure. You make art
and you want people to

697
00:51:36,665 --> 00:51:39,385
see it. - Wait, what
happened to the tree?

698
00:51:39,386 --> 00:51:44,671
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree
is not artistic if no one cuts it down.

00:51:51,622 --> 00:51:54,091

- You do.

702
00:51:54,092 --> 00:51:56,208
No, I don't.

- Hi.
- Hi.

704
00:52:03,098 --> 00:52:06,743
So you, like, come from
a town like this or...?

705
00:52:06,744 --> 00:52:10,228
No, not really. I come from an "area".
Bel Air.

706
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:16,364
- You rich?
- No, not really. Middle-class.

707
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:19,682
Oh, me too. Middle-class.

708
00:52:20,213 --> 00:52:22,400
Maybe upper-middle-class.

My dad didn't get me a BMW.

- What'd he get you?
- A Porsche.

783
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:47,713
- Yeah. So, what about you?
- What about me? I don't have a car.

784
00:58:48,664 --> 00:58:51,033
You just seem to know all
these things about me

785
00:58:51,045 --> 00:58:53,426
and I don't know anything
about you, you know.

786
00:58:57,927 --> 00:58:59,767
What kind of music do you like?

787
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:05,761
- Military marching bands.
- You think I'm rich and you hate me.

788
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:12,894
Now, how the hell would you know
what I think? Hm? You don't know me.

789
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:16,331
- I'd like to.
- Oh, yeah?

790
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:17,692
- You know, it was the biggest
mistake of my life. - Really?

791
01:00:18,943 --> 01:00:25,387
Well, I mean, you have to understand I
was just this dopey kid mopping floors

792
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:30,683
and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I
enlisted right out of high school. So,

793
01:00:33,206 --> 01:00:35,780
I just wanted something different in
my life.

794
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:44,178
"It's not a job, it's an adventure."
Right? I hated it. I had to get out.

795
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:50,259
So I was working in
the kitchen, chopping

796
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:53,863
lettuce, you know, real
heroic stuff, and I,

797
01:00:54,604 --> 01:01:01,153
I had this big fucking knife and I
chopped off the tip of my little finger

798
01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:03,343
and three days later I was a free man.

799
01:01:03,354 --> 01:01:05,886
- You cut off your little finger?
- Well, they,

800
01:01:05,898 --> 01:01:08,441
uh they were nice enough
to sew it back on.

801
01:01:11,608 --> 01:01:16,620
Honorable discharge.
Disabled while serving.

802
01:01:17,725 --> 01:01:19,766
I get a check every month.

803
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,417
- Um, four for smoking, please.
- Closed, closed.

804
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:45,942
- Oh, man, no closed, we just got here!
- Midnight closed.

805
01:01:46,443 --> 01:01:48,863
Oh, come on! We're hungry. Please?

806
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,089
Yo, do you know who
this guy is right here?

807
01:01:55,398 --> 01:01:58,475
That's Pony Moynihan from MTV.

808
01:02:00,401 --> 01:02:02,765
Yeah look at his limo out there.

809
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:07,971
- TV?
- MTV.

810
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:12,733
- What? You're going to turn him away?
- Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.

811
01:02:13,765 --> 01:02:17,726
He's probably the most famous guy
that'd ever come in this place.

812
01:02:17,918 --> 01:02:19,928
You're lucky he's here.

813
01:02:22,637 --> 01:02:24,050
Yeah.

814
01:02:24,797 --> 01:02:28,098
Take-out only. Wait, I get picture.

815
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:31,611
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks. See man?

816
01:02:37,163 --> 01:02:39,828
You know? I remember coming
here with my parents.

817
01:02:42,013 --> 01:02:48,121
You know, I should, um, make a video of
this place. You know, bring the camera in.

818
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,259
- You make videos? - Oh, yeah, all
the time. That's what I do now.

819
01:02:55,036 --> 01:02:58,651
You know what would be cool is,
like, to do a music video,

820
01:02:58,663 --> 01:03:02,290
you know? But, like, you
know, have it set in here.

821
01:03:03,302 --> 01:03:05,933
You know, like, like, like,
with her and shit. You

822
01:03:05,945 --> 01:03:08,587
know, like, you know, like,
"Closed, closed, closed."

823
01:03:08,857 --> 01:03:12,290
- "Closed, closed, closed." But
with your music. - You could do it.

824
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:13,565
I could.

825
01:03:13,866 --> 01:03:15,943
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

826
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,708
I mean, do you have something I could show
my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?

827
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:21,290
- Yes!
- Yeah!

828
01:03:24,088 --> 01:03:25,327
A reel?

829
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,318
I mean, what is there to
be happy about really?

830
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:36,615
I mean, going to the gym,
climbing the StairMaster,

831
01:03:36,627 --> 01:03:40,755
eating the yogurt,
checking the voice mail.

832
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:44,482
Smoking the low-tar cigarettes,

833
01:03:46,415 --> 01:03:48,614
shaving the bikini line.

834
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,593
Sometimes I just want something
different, you know?

835
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,825
- What was your name again?
- Erica.

836
01:04:08,662 --> 01:04:12,116
Erica. So do you think you
and I are alike, Erica?

837
01:04:12,897 --> 01:04:16,657
Deep down. Way down.

838
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:27,786
- It's a mistake to think that. - We could
still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.

839
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,225
- It's nice to do a lot of things.
- That's what I mean.

840
01:04:36,982 --> 01:04:40,146
- I'm not a nice guy.
- I know. It's okay.

841
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,587
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

842
01:04:42,734 --> 01:04:44,342
I'm a big girl.

843
01:04:44,862 --> 01:04:48,318
I can take care of myself. If I didn't
want to be here,

844
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,982
I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch
of kids looking for Chinese food.

845
01:04:51,983 --> 01:04:54,952
- No, no, see, you, you don't know.
- No?

846
01:04:58,131 --> 01:05:00,021
So teach me a lesson.

847
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:16,543
Hey, when I get shitfaced I
can get this huge appetite.

848
01:05:19,025 --> 01:05:20,438
God.

849
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:35,046
I don't know why. Most people
don't, but I do. Whoo!

850
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:51,588
You okay, man?

851
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:54,874
You okay?

852
01:05:56,413 --> 01:06:00,584
- I didn't want to eat this much, man.
- Wait, I'll get you some air.

853
01:06:03,885 --> 01:06:06,638
Wait, do the windows, okay? Just do 'em.

854
01:06:12,616 --> 01:06:16,241
- Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
- You done?

855
01:06:17,064 --> 01:06:18,111
Yeah.

856
01:06:27,092 --> 01:06:28,787
Oh, crap!

857
01:06:46,611 --> 01:06:51,194
Oh, oh, hi. Oh, Missus Douglas, I
hope I'm not calling too late.

858
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:56,870
No, have you seen Bee-Bee?
Well, no, yeah, she was,

859
01:06:56,905 --> 01:07:02,557
I was just wondering if you'd seen her.
She did? Okay.

860
01:07:04,809 --> 01:07:09,109
Yeah. No, I'm sorry to bother you,
Missus Douglas. Okay, 'bye.

861
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:12,301
Shit. She always answers.

862
01:07:13,758 --> 01:07:18,811
- Hey! Hey, you guys!
- No. No. Put back the leprechaun.

863
01:07:18,946 --> 01:07:21,663
- Oh, fuck.
- Go!

864
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:24,176
What are you doing, you idiot?

865
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:26,940
- Open the damn door!
- Open, open, open, open!

866
01:07:26,975 --> 01:07:30,970
Go, go, go, come on! Come on!

867
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,450
- Go!
- Go!

868
01:07:52,317 --> 01:07:57,621
Oh, man, don't be gettin' soft on me.
I mean, sorry, it's ok.

869
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:01,641
It's okay, just don't think, okay?
Just don't think.

870
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:09,156
"Black and orange
Black and orange
Hear that hearty yell
Rah rah rah"

871
01:08:16,249 --> 01:08:24,486
"G, O, F, O, R, I, T. Go for it!"

872
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:29,429
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.

873
01:08:31,027 --> 01:08:33,834
Oh, man. Wow. I was never
into football, you know?

874
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:37,491
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind
if we pull over really quickly?

875
01:08:37,844 --> 01:08:40,180
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm sorry.

876
01:08:40,344 --> 01:08:41,381
George. Pull over.

877
01:09:05,205 --> 01:09:08,310
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.

878
01:09:17,548 --> 01:09:22,057
Burnfield. No place like it.

879
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:26,068
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and
Puke capital of the world.

880
01:09:27,807 --> 01:09:30,960
- I can't believe you're still here.
- I'm moving.

881
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:38,419
- If...
- No, I'm going.

882
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,994
- Yeep.
- What's that supposed to mean?

883
01:09:42,131 --> 01:09:46,169
- I don't know. I say what I mean.
- Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.

884
01:09:47,174 --> 01:09:48,490
That's because I am.

885
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:27,710
It's okay.

886
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:32,341
This kind of thing happens.

887
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,911
It's just never happened to me.

888
01:10:42,543 --> 01:10:43,543
I'm sorry.

889
01:10:45,164 --> 01:10:46,970
It's true though. Mm.

890
01:10:57,457 --> 01:11:02,042
So, um, what's your
TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?

891
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:06,688
Taking Care of Business.

892
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,593
I'm sorry.

893
01:11:36,615 --> 01:11:38,339
I hate it here.

894
01:11:39,447 --> 01:11:42,472
It's so ugly, it's like being dead.

895
01:11:43,572 --> 01:11:47,147
You got out
of here, you know? I'm ready to go.

896
01:11:47,348 --> 01:11:51,644
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out
why I left in the first place, you know?

897
01:11:53,052 --> 01:11:57,687
I think about people and I
wonder what they're doing.

898
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,434
- Yeah.
- I think about you.

899
01:12:02,438 --> 01:12:04,491
- A lot.
- Me?

900
01:12:06,016 --> 01:12:08,250
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.

901
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:13,314
Yeah, you know, when you called I
thought, there's a name from the past.

902
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:15,439
Or the future.

903
01:12:16,702 --> 01:12:22,375
Oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be
working on that album cover, right?

904
01:12:24,485 --> 01:12:28,107
- Yeah, I know what you're saying.
- You do?

905
01:12:28,108 --> 01:12:29,413
Yeah.

906
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:34,965
God, you showed up at such
a weird time in my life.

907
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:57,274
I just walked all the way
from Westside to here.

908
01:12:58,729 --> 01:13:01,716
I haven't walked that
far since junior high.

909
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:15,620
- I thought you didn't drink.
- I don't anymore.

910
01:13:17,452 --> 01:13:20,599
- Can I have some?
- Knock yourself out.

911
01:13:34,986 --> 01:13:39,179
You know, one moment
things are so fucked up

912
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,948
than you look at it from a
totally different angle

913
01:13:42,191 --> 01:13:45,332
- and it makes sense.
- Yeah.

914
01:13:46,883 --> 01:13:50,465
Did you ever hear that saying,
"This too shall pass"?

915
01:13:50,466 --> 01:13:52,996
Sure, all the time, in Group.

916
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:54,992
In Group?

917
01:13:55,636 --> 01:13:58,201
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go

918
01:13:58,202 --> 01:14:01,533
once a week. It's kind of like AA.

919
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:04,954
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate.

920
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:09,531
That must've been intense.

921
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,380
Intense.

922
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:19,368
- How long were you in there?
- Uh, ninety days.

923
01:14:20,629 --> 01:14:25,325
And now I just have to go once a week.
See, I'm rehabilitated.

924
01:14:29,053 --> 01:14:34,057
- Well, you shouldn't drink.
Are you gonna drink? - No.

925
01:14:35,987 --> 01:14:38,914
Oh, maybe. Fuck.

926
01:14:43,673 --> 01:14:47,074
I mean, that would suck if
you had to go back to rehab.

927
01:14:47,086 --> 01:14:50,498
Yeah, it would suck big time.
I'd kill myself first.

928
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:56,150
It was pretty bad, huh?

929
01:14:57,614 --> 01:15:06,057
It was like hell with windows. You
know, there's shit on the walls.

930
01:15:06,483 --> 01:15:09,500
Kids my age sucking their thumbs.

931
01:15:11,438 --> 01:15:14,800
I mean, every day I would,
I'd wake up in my cell

932
01:15:14,816 --> 01:15:21,484
and I'd think, my parents put me
here. Why? Why?

933
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:26,671
Because I stayed out all night one time.

934
01:15:27,765 --> 01:15:31,303
Uh, because I broke the
VCR when I was drunk.

935
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:34,169
Because I was out of control.

936
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:41,022
I thought my parents loved me.

937
01:15:50,415 --> 01:15:56,589
Hey, do you got any water? And some B-One?

938
01:16:02,131 --> 01:16:04,003
Hey, where did everybody go?

939
01:16:07,022 --> 01:16:08,877
- Hey, hey. Okay?
- Sor-sorry, Bruce.

940
01:16:16,019 --> 01:16:24,125
We were all riding around and it
suddenly hit me what we were doing.

941
01:16:24,756 --> 01:16:27,481
We were getting off on the fact that

942
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:31,568
we're in a car teen feet
longer than all the rest.

943
01:16:32,597 --> 01:16:37,045
- And I got out and I just
started walking. - Yeah.

944
01:16:41,278 --> 01:16:45,830
Well, what it was... I, I
don't want to admit it, but,

945
01:16:47,248 --> 01:16:49,439
you know, I was jealous of Pony.

946
01:16:51,819 --> 01:16:54,744
Well, sure, he's rich
and he's famous. He's

947
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:57,692
got everything and
you've got nothing.

948
01:17:02,488 --> 01:17:06,518
Yeah, but, when I was walking,

949
01:17:08,021 --> 01:17:14,464
I realized that he's stuck in that
limo all the time.

950
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:20,140
He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck
with his autograph,

951
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:24,562
he has to do whatever his manager
tells him to do, you know?

952
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,941
He's not free. He's just
part of the machine,

953
01:17:28,942 --> 01:17:31,857
and if you think about it, freedom's
all that there really is.

954
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:32,881
Yeah, I guess.

955
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:37,338
You know? And it used to
scare me so much that

956
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:39,540
I didn't know what was
coming in my life.

957
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:42,797
You know, like, like,
I would always think,

958
01:17:42,809 --> 01:17:45,084
uh, you know, what if I
make the wrong move?

959
01:17:45,085 --> 01:17:47,914
But maybe there isn't any right move.

960
01:17:49,802 --> 01:17:55,596
I mean, look at us. You know, we all
dress the same, we all talk the same,

961
01:17:55,597 --> 01:18:00,193
we all fuck the same, we
all watch the same TV.

962
01:18:00,894 --> 01:18:04,333
Nobody's really different, even
if they think they're different.

963
01:18:04,602 --> 01:18:06,783
"Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?"

964
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:14,191
And see, that's what makes me free.
Because I can do anything I want,

965
01:18:14,592 --> 01:18:17,319
as long as I don't care about the result.

966
01:18:18,155 --> 01:18:24,215
Anything is possible. It
is night on planet earth

967
01:18:25,549 --> 01:18:27,517
and I'm alive.

968
01:18:29,528 --> 01:18:33,253
And someday I'll be dead. Someday
I'll just be bones in a box,

969
01:18:33,443 --> 01:18:37,259
but right now, I', not.
And anything is possible.

970
01:18:38,411 --> 01:18:41,497
And that's why
I can go to New York with Sooze

971
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:44,672
because each moment can just be
what it is.

972
01:18:44,673 --> 01:18:49,575
There's no failure, there's no mistake.
I just, I just go there

973
01:18:49,576 --> 01:18:53,489
and live there and what happens, happens.

974
01:18:55,172 --> 01:19:02,359
And so, right now I'm getting
naked and I'm not afraid.

975
01:19:04,914 --> 01:19:10,477
I don't need money, man. I don't, I don't
even need, I don't even need a future.

976
01:19:13,729 --> 01:19:17,897
I, I could knock out all of my teeth
with a hammer. So what?!

977
01:19:19,253 --> 01:19:24,497
You know, I could poke my eyes out. I'd
still be alive, you know?

978
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:26,852
At least I'd know that
I was doing something

979
01:19:26,864 --> 01:19:29,230
real for two or three
seconds, you know?

980
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:32,843
It's all about
feat and I'm not afraid anymore, man.

981
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:37,419
Fuck it! Fuck fear!

982
01:19:44,298 --> 01:19:46,746
Bravo, you son-of-a-bitch!

983
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:55,497
- Is that Jeff?
- Oh my God...

984
01:20:05,737 --> 01:20:12,820
Do you ever wake up in the morning and
think, "Well, here's another day"?

985
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:17,520
You know? It's just like the last
one.

986
01:20:19,627 --> 01:20:23,151
I mean what difference
does it make, you know.

987
01:20:31,548 --> 01:20:34,341
- You know, my mom has this saying.
- Yeah?

988
01:20:34,442 --> 01:20:39,663
- "Don't write any checks you can't cash."
- Really? What else does your mother say?

989
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,830
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.

990
01:20:53,173 --> 01:20:56,102
Hey, where did you go? We
were worried about you.

991
01:20:56,187 --> 01:20:59,814
- Uh, home, you know. - Yeah, I talked
to your mom. I think I woke her up.

992
01:21:00,531 --> 01:21:03,969
- I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
- You didn't get me in trouble.

993
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:07,482
- Hey, where's Erica?
- I don't know.

994
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,464
Gee, Jeff, I thought you
were gonna go take a

995
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:15,631
piss, not join some
alcoholic nudist colony.

996
01:21:16,177 --> 01:21:19,549
No, no. I just got sick
and tired of listening

997
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:22,945
to that demo tape over and
over again, you know?

998
01:21:22,946 --> 01:21:26,350
I mean, I felt like a
fucking groupie, you know.

999
01:21:26,362 --> 01:21:29,778
Mm. I enjoyed the ride.
Sorry you didn't.

1000
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:32,855
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight.

1001
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,693
- I'm so sorry.
- What?

1002
01:21:37,113 --> 01:21:41,979
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got
out of the car I walked all the way here.

1003
01:21:42,025 --> 01:21:45,354
- And I fig-and I figured something out.
- Oh, yeah?

1004
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:56,298
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield,

1005
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,849
I present to you the keys to the city.

1006
01:22:07,262 --> 01:22:10,563
- So, how was the ride, kids?
- Great.

1007
01:22:10,605 --> 01:22:13,646
- Really? - It was the nicest
thin I've done in a long time.

1008
01:22:13,647 --> 01:22:16,357
- Oh that's nice for you.
- Where's Erica?

1009
01:22:22,123 --> 01:22:28,073
- You seen her? - Erica? She said she
was tired. She went back to the hotel.

1010
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:34,172
- Oh, How'd she get back?
- I called Bucky's. I got her a cab.

1011
01:22:35,254 --> 01:22:38,997
- Is there any hot mustard?
- I don't know.

1012
01:22:39,278 --> 01:22:43,323
They are old, we are young,
they are fast, we are fun.

1013
01:22:43,329 --> 01:22:45,815
Buff. What a fuck?

1014
01:22:45,816 --> 01:22:49,540
- Sooze, I, I have to talk to you,
'cause... - God, you smell like whiskey.

1015
01:22:50,877 --> 01:22:54,402
- No, no, I have to talk to you.
- Is that a threat?

1016
01:22:54,405 --> 01:22:58,298
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand.

1017
01:22:58,593 --> 01:23:01,257
Tasted exactly like this
sparerib.

1018
01:23:02,753 --> 01:23:05,550
- No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
- Forget about New

1019
01:23:05,562 --> 01:23:08,311
York, Jeff. I don't want to
talk about New York anymore.

1020
01:23:08,312 --> 01:23:11,159
There was this other
place where they served

1021
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:14,029
live monkey brains. Sweat to God.
You walk in,

1022
01:23:14,064 --> 01:23:16,741
they bring the little monkey out,
shave his head,

1023
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:21,540
crack it open, and you eat it's
brains while it's still alive.

1024
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:27,746
I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't
have any money and my mom has a saying:

1025
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:30,808
"Don't write any checks you can't cash".

1026
01:23:35,151 --> 01:23:38,685
- Tim, what are you talking about?
- Ask your girlfriend.

1027
01:23:41,623 --> 01:23:46,246
- Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's
just no answer. - What are you? Her pimp?

1028
01:23:47,631 --> 01:23:49,937
She said she might
go get a drink first.

1029
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:52,266
Well, I mean, she always
answers her beeper.

1030
01:23:52,543 --> 01:23:55,027
- Pal, she's a big girl, you know?
I'm sure

1031
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:57,534
she's alright. - Yeah?
Well, what'd she say?

1032
01:23:58,174 --> 01:24:01,673
- About what?
- About where she went. I mean, what bar?

1033
01:24:01,674 --> 01:24:05,039
- She didn't say. Maybe
she's at the bar at the

1034
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:08,428
hotel. - The bar at the hotel?
She told you that?

1035
01:24:11,388 --> 01:24:15,162
- What did she say exactly?
- Well, Dad...

1036
01:24:16,114 --> 01:24:18,736
she said she wanted to suck my cock.

1037
01:24:19,695 --> 01:24:23,274
- Okay?
- She might wanna such your cock, too.

1038
01:24:24,242 --> 01:24:27,738
- Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
- I think I gotta go.

1039
01:24:28,352 --> 01:24:31,314
What? Oh, come on. You're
not gonna suck my cock?

1040
01:24:32,326 --> 01:24:34,243
Fuck you, man.

1041
01:24:36,681 --> 01:24:38,462
I never did anything to you!

1042
01:24:38,694 --> 01:24:44,392
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking
language, alright? Or I might have to.

1043
01:24:45,402 --> 01:24:48,473
- Whatever.
- Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding.

1044
01:24:48,474 --> 01:24:52,051
Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive,
huh? You know, there's a life on the road?

1045
01:24:52,052 --> 01:24:55,023
- Don't do that, man, okay?
- Could you give me a ride?

1046
01:24:55,024 --> 01:25:00,450
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride,
the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.

1047
01:25:01,099 --> 01:25:03,232
- Tim, go throw up somewhere.
- You know, man,

1048
01:25:03,244 --> 01:25:05,353
it's none of your
business what I do, okay?

1049
01:25:05,354 --> 01:25:07,032
- It's none of my business?
- Yeah.

1050
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:09,401
Oh, okay, it's none of my business.
Yeah, so,

1051
01:25:09,413 --> 01:25:11,659
you-you're trying to fuck
my best friend's girlfriend

1052
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:14,766
- and it's none of my business?!
- What the fuck are you talking about?!

1053
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:17,368
- Nobody's fucking anybody!
- No, see, Neil,

1054
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,993
if you're fucking with
one of my friends,

1055
01:25:20,428 --> 01:25:23,529
- then you're fucking with me.
- Don't do that.

1056
01:25:23,556 --> 01:25:26,660
- What are you going to do? Hm?
- If you hit me...

1057
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:29,237
...my manager will slap
an assault charge on

1058
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,837
your ass faster than
you can say AA, okay?

1059
01:25:31,838 --> 01:25:34,716
- Your manager?
- Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.

1060
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:38,077
- You know, have 'em call me.
Y-you know where to

1061
01:25:38,089 --> 01:25:40,554
find me, right? - Oh, yeah,
drunk on the corner, man.

1062
01:25:40,738 --> 01:25:45,685
- Hey, why don't you buy another beer.
It's on me, okay? - Thanks, man!

1063
01:25:45,981 --> 01:25:48,275
I'll be in the car, okay?

1064
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,362
Wait a minute, Sooze.
What are you doing?

1065
01:25:50,374 --> 01:25:52,472
I'm leaving. Is that
alright with you?

1066
01:25:52,473 --> 01:25:55,160
Do I have your permission?
Maybe you want to think about it.

1067
01:25:55,161 --> 01:25:57,868
- Where are you going?
- For a ride.

1068
01:25:57,969 --> 01:26:02,898
- Wait, away?
- Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.

1069
01:26:02,933 --> 01:26:05,178
- To his hotel?
- Shit, Jeff!

1070
01:26:05,179 --> 01:26:08,875
- You know what we should do? Go to the...
- So you can do an album cover?

1071
01:26:08,876 --> 01:26:12,403
- I've run out of words.
- Wait. What, what are you saying?

1072
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:18,679
- I don't know. And I don't care that
I don't know. - Well, what about us?

1073
01:26:19,027 --> 01:26:23,002
What about us? I'm moving
away your staying here.

1074
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:25,450
No, maybe not though. That,
that's what I'm trying to say.

1075
01:26:25,451 --> 01:26:29,908
Maybe not? You think that I'm with
somebody else and now it's maybe not?

1076
01:26:29,909 --> 01:26:31,941
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You're unbelievable.

1077
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:34,311
- Wait, no, I... Look,
Sooze, I figured

1078
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:36,703
something out. - You did, huh?
Good for you.

1079
01:26:37,971 --> 01:26:40,651
- Oh, fuck it, man!
- Fuck it!

1080
01:26:40,652 --> 01:26:43,344
You know what? Go with him.
Just go with him.

1081
01:26:43,345 --> 01:26:47,508
- In the limo!!!
- Do your covers and all that shit.

1082
01:26:49,056 --> 01:26:50,438
'Bye, Jeff.

1083
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:53,684
- Go.
- What?

1084
01:26:55,186 --> 01:26:56,733
Just go.

1085
01:26:58,325 --> 01:27:01,227
You really suck, you know that?

1086
01:27:01,423 --> 01:27:03,174
Just go.

1087
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,953
To women.

1088
01:27:33,918 --> 01:27:35,772
They're all whores.

1089
01:27:39,372 --> 01:27:42,446
Let us not forget what Chenowsky said.

1090
01:27:44,739 --> 01:27:48,345
"The greatest men are the most alone."

1091
01:27:50,704 --> 01:27:55,502
And without suffering, Jeffery,
you will never gain wisdom.

1092
01:27:56,908 --> 01:28:00,696
I'm not suffering, you know.
I don't give a shit.

1093
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:07,941
Good. That's good.

1094
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:05,998
You know I've realized somethig, man.
It's not a big deal.

1095
01:29:06,283 --> 01:29:11,634
You know, I'm not jealous
of Pony, you know.

1096
01:29:14,644 --> 01:29:18,682
Yeah, no, you're right.
It's no big deal, you know.

1097
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:26,640
Guy probably has his arm around
her right now, holding her close,

1098
01:29:28,544 --> 01:29:35,040
nudging her titty with his elbow, talking
about the deep significance of his music,

1099
01:29:35,068 --> 01:29:39,114
while she looks up at him with her big
brown eyes.

1100
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:44,684
In a few minutes they'll be
back at the Four Seasons.

1101
01:29:44,696 --> 01:29:48,216
You ever, you ever stayed
in one of those places?

1102
01:29:49,821 --> 01:29:51,438
No.

1103
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,692
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the
garage, you know what I mean?

1104
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:04,435
Fuck. So they'll talk and talk.
They'll probably talk all night.

1105
01:30:05,594 --> 01:30:09,440
And, oh, they'll decide that they're
gonna spend the night together, right?

1106
01:30:09,441 --> 01:30:11,631
But, you know, they're
gonna keep their

1107
01:30:11,643 --> 01:30:13,844
underwear on and they're
not gonna do anything.

1108
01:30:15,682 --> 01:30:17,805
By six a.m.

1109
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:21,072
he's parking the pink Cadillac.

1110
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:26,589
Fuck.

1111
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:31,632
There's really only one answer.

1112
01:30:34,051 --> 01:30:35,351
What?

1113
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:43,725
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em.
You know what I mean?

1114
01:30:45,783 --> 01:30:49,554
Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!

1115
01:30:50,204 --> 01:30:51,512
Fuck 'em!

1116
01:30:53,512 --> 01:30:57,019
- Fuck 'em all, man!
- Yeah.

1117
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:01,560
Yes! You’re learning, kid. That's right!
You're learning.

1118
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:13,135
Oh, it's the man.

1119
01:31:17,029 --> 01:31:22,209
- What's up guys? - Uh, you know,
just admiring the scenery, you know?

1120
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:27,778
- This one.He causes all the trouble.
- Been drinking again, Timmy-boy?

1121
01:31:27,808 --> 01:31:31,271
You were a shitty lineman
and now you’re a shitty cop.

1122
01:31:31,372 --> 01:31:33,172
Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.

1123
01:31:33,624 --> 01:31:36,244
- Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
- Who's

1124
01:31:36,256 --> 01:31:38,888
going to slow me down?
You, you fat pig.

1125
01:31:39,089 --> 01:31:41,299
- Alright, get in the car before
I have to embarrass you in

1126
01:31:41,311 --> 01:31:43,533
front of your friend. - Hey,
Gary, how's the divorce comin'?

1127
01:31:43,534 --> 01:31:45,179
Asshole.

1128
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:47,954
Cuff him and stuff him.

1129
01:31:56,938 --> 01:32:00,119
- Get in, sir!
- Okay. We'll go for a ride.

1130
01:32:05,015 --> 01:32:07,135
Can you tell me what happened?

1131
01:32:07,299 --> 01:32:10,679
Ele est+AOE-b+AOo-bado. Causando
problemas. Estava aqui antes.

1132
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:13,985
- He's drunk.
- Aha.

1133
01:32:17,656 --> 01:32:22,374
You gotta help me out, man.
I'm in trouble.

1134
01:32:24,188 --> 01:32:26,167
Oh, no, no, no. This
is no big deal, you

1135
01:32:26,179 --> 01:32:28,170
know? I can come down
and, and get you out.

1136
01:32:28,651 --> 01:32:32,205
No, no. I'm not, I'm not
talking about this.

1137
01:32:35,173 --> 01:32:39,859
- I did a bad thing, Jeff.
- What? What'd you do?

1138
01:32:42,218 --> 01:32:44,276
That chick, Erica?

1139
01:32:47,111 --> 01:32:53,462
- Well, w-what happened? - Well, I, you
know, I took her to the van, you know.

1140
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:58,870
It was goin' all hot and heavy

1141
01:33:00,712 --> 01:33:05,577
and she started hanging on me, you know?
And she started crying,

1142
01:33:05,578 --> 01:33:11,439
"Tim, Tim, what's the matter?
I love you. Don't go!"

1143
01:33:12,945 --> 01:33:19,389
And I was just looking at her
stupid face and her stupid eyes,

1144
01:33:21,453 --> 01:33:23,743
stupid mouth

1145
01:33:24,792 --> 01:33:33,769
and I was filled with disgust, man.
And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...

1146
01:33:34,067 --> 01:33:36,388
What'd you do?

1147
01:33:38,216 --> 01:33:41,161
- I hit her.
- You hit her?

1148
01:33:44,675 --> 01:33:50,195
- Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit
her? - Because I was fucked up, man.

1149
01:33:53,328 --> 01:33:57,233
I just kept hittin' her
till she didn't move anymore.

1150
01:33:57,245 --> 01:34:01,162
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
She's unconscious?

1151
01:34:03,546 --> 01:34:04,858
Go look, man.

1152
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:08,533
Go look. Go see for yourself,
if you got the guts.

1153
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:48,189
You know, this, what you're
doing with your life...

1154
01:34:49,013 --> 01:34:50,289
I don't know.

1155
01:34:51,866 --> 01:34:58,330
You know, it's not you. You know?
You seem like a smart guy.

1156
01:35:01,096 --> 01:35:03,418
Yeah, well, thank you
for the advice, but you

1157
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:05,763
wouldn't understand what
is going on with me.

1158
01:35:06,097 --> 01:35:09,872
- Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
- That's right.

1159
01:35:10,485 --> 01:35:14,426
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?

1160
01:36:07,946 --> 01:36:09,599
Erica?

1161
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:23,951
- Hey! Whoa, you look like
shit. You been home yet? - No.

1162
01:37:24,686 --> 01:37:28,603
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what
we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hang on.

1163
01:37:29,959 --> 01:37:34,668
Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man.
A long, long, long...

1164
01:37:36,467 --> 01:37:38,556
night.

1165
01:38:03,053 --> 01:38:10,996
Hi, uh, yeah, I'd, like to report a...
What? No, yeah, no, I'd like to report a,

1166
01:38:10,997 --> 01:38:14,040
report a crime.

1167
01:38:15,394 --> 01:38:18,498
No, I can't hold, I don't... alright.

1168
01:38:26,309 --> 01:38:29,446
- Hey. Hey. Are you trying to
get a hold of Sooze? - No.

1169
01:38:48,916 --> 01:38:52,439
It's gonna be a beautiful
fucking day, man.

1170
01:39:03,498 --> 01:39:12,536
Oh, God! Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two!

1171
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:23,229
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you.
It's okay. Enjoy yourself.

1172
01:39:28,237 --> 01:39:30,965
- Are you talking to me?
- It's okay.

1173
01:39:32,027 --> 01:39:35,078
- Glad it's okay.
- I'll tell you what.

1174
01:39:35,276 --> 01:39:39,040
When I get my engineering degree and I'm
swimming in my swimming pool,

1175
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:41,002
it will be very fucking okay.

1176
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:43,678
Um, if you're talking
to me, could you make

1177
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:45,910
some sense? 'Cause I
don't speak Swahili.

1178
01:39:47,533 --> 01:39:52,051
In two more years I'll have an engineering
degree. We'll sell the store,

1179
01:39:52,052 --> 01:39:55,228
we'll move away from Burnfield and
the store and you standing here.

1180
01:39:55,463 --> 01:40:01,450
- Good. See you later.
- You're a drunk and an idiot.

1181
01:40:06,008 --> 01:40:12,508
You're wife sucks my cock every
night, swallows my cum and loves it.

1182
01:40:13,683 --> 01:40:20,392
- That's okay. - Yeah it's okay. You
know, we have a saying back home:

1183
01:40:21,079 --> 01:40:24,968
"Either the salt is rotten or the meat."

1184
01:40:28,993 --> 01:40:34,556
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart,
chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.

1185
01:40:35,205 --> 01:40:37,464
Ah, that's nice. They
have many convenience

1186
01:40:37,476 --> 01:40:39,746
stores there for you
to stand in front of.

1187
01:40:49,217 --> 01:40:54,223
- Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
- No, no, I wasn't trying.

1188
01:40:57,059 --> 01:41:02,298
She was at the Four Seasons last night,
man. But you shouldn't worry about that.

1189
01:41:04,327 --> 01:41:07,740
- No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm
not worried. - No. Life is too short.

1190
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:12,850
- No, I'm not worried.
- Good.

1191
01:41:19,789 --> 01:41:23,485
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell
you something and, uh, you

1192
01:41:23,497 --> 01:41:27,205
got, you got, you gotta promise
not to tell anyone, alright?

1193
01:41:29,076 --> 01:41:32,551
- No, I mean, no one.
- Hey, you know me.

1194
01:41:32,552 --> 01:41:35,591
Buff, look at me for a second.
No, this is serious.

1195
01:41:37,918 --> 01:41:39,161
Yeah.

1196
01:41:46,407 --> 01:41:49,889
- Uh, last night...
- Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man,

1197
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:54,094
- I know. You're my friend,
she's your old lady. - No, no.

1198
01:41:54,095 --> 01:41:57,348
I feel really bad about that, but
I was busy, you know, I mean...

1199
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:00,905
No, look, this is not
about Sooze, alright.

1200
01:42:02,207 --> 01:42:05,608
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed
at the Four Seasons last night with

1201
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:09,032
Pony? - Yeah, we all stayed at the
Four Seasons, man. It was party time.

1202
01:42:09,033 --> 01:42:15,763
I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager.
Really nice guy.

1203
01:42:15,864 --> 01:42:20,826
We talked about the video. They want a
raw look. Something fresh. Danny said

1204
01:42:20,827 --> 01:42:24,300
if I can capture the reality of
Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.

1205
01:42:24,325 --> 01:42:25,629
- Okay, Buff, listen
to me for a second

1206
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:26,957
alright? - No, I know
what you're going to say.

1207
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:30,103
I don't know anything about
making a video. But that's a plus.

1208
01:42:30,104 --> 01:42:33,965
Because since I'm just starting out,
I've got a fresh point of view,

1209
01:42:33,966 --> 01:42:37,530
and that's good for, you know,
marketing, demographics...

1210
01:42:37,531 --> 01:42:39,207
- Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
- But I'd,

1211
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:40,906
I'd do it for free. You
know, just for my reel.

1212
01:42:40,907 --> 01:42:43,302
- Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
- Oh, and guess who showed up.

1213
01:42:43,303 --> 01:42:45,103
No, shut up!

1214
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:52,119
- Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
- I know, man.

1215
01:42:54,164 --> 01:42:58,553
- You know? - Yeah, that's what I'm
trying to tell you. That chick Erica?

1216
01:42:58,554 --> 01:43:03,307
- What, they're looking for her? - No man,
she showed up last night at the hotel.

1217
01:43:03,308 --> 01:43:11,652
We had a great time together. I stayed in
her room last night, man. What can I say?

1218
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:19,636
Wait a minute. You
saw Erica last night?

1219
01:43:19,648 --> 01:43:22,556
Yeah, I saw all of
Erica last night, man.

1220
01:43:29,963 --> 01:43:34,574
Buff, you got to stop making shit up.
It didn't happen.

1221
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:46,366
- Y-s-sure it did.
- No. It didn't, Buff.

1222
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:54,067
Wait. Hey, man.

1223
01:43:57,403 --> 01:44:00,455
- Erica is in the van back there.
- What?

1224
01:44:01,644 --> 01:44:05,377
- Look. She's in the van.
- What she doin' in the van, man?

1225
01:44:05,478 --> 01:44:10,348
- Buff... She's dead.
- She's dead?

1226
01:44:10,795 --> 01:44:15,322
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.

1227
01:44:15,323 --> 01:44:17,404
- Bullshit.
- No, no, no.

1228
01:44:17,405 --> 01:44:21,400
- That's bullshit. That's total utter
bullshit. - Oh, really? You wanna go look?

1229
01:44:21,401 --> 01:44:23,694
- Yeah, man - Let's go look,
then. Let's go look, then!

1230
01:44:23,695 --> 01:44:25,495
Look! Look!

1231
01:44:26,763 --> 01:44:30,127
Cock-a-doole-doo! Good morning!

1232
01:44:45,655 --> 01:44:50,247
- I'm so burnt-out.
- Oh, how did you get burnt-out?

1233
01:44:50,403 --> 01:44:54,288
- Playing with something really hot.
- Yeah?

1234
01:44:58,424 --> 01:45:02,549
Oh, my God, you found it.
Thank you so much.

1235
01:45:03,541 --> 01:45:05,193
Did you get your tape?

1236
01:45:05,228 --> 01:45:12,020
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got
to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel,

1237
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:17,294
and if I get the gig, Erica is
gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.

1238
01:45:17,381 --> 01:45:20,855
- Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if
you don't get the gig. - I can come visit?

1239
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:24,313
- You better! Yes!
- I will.

1240
01:45:25,084 --> 01:45:27,276
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff.
If you're

1241
01:45:27,288 --> 01:45:29,492
ever in L.A., you should
come by the offices.

1242
01:45:29,493 --> 01:45:32,173
I talked to Pony earlier. He said he
had a really nice time

1243
01:45:32,174 --> 01:45:34,226
and he's really looking forward to reading
some of your songs.

1244
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:36,969
Yeah, tell Pony to go fuck himself.

1245
01:45:37,221 --> 01:45:39,315
Okay, I'll do that.

1246
01:45:40,818 --> 01:45:42,878
Okay, hurry up.

1247
01:45:45,624 --> 01:45:49,188
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!

1248
01:45:53,399 --> 01:45:57,197
Not dead! Definitely not dead!

1249
01:45:59,181 --> 01:46:02,975
- Guess not.
- See, I wasn't making shit up, man.

1250
01:46:04,039 --> 01:46:09,661
- No.
- God, Tim lied to your ass, man.

1251
01:46:10,502 --> 01:46:12,999
That guy's sad, man.

1252
01:46:13,927 --> 01:46:16,497
Well, uh, I gotta go, but,
uh, listen, if I don't

1253
01:46:16,509 --> 01:46:19,091
come back, I'll send a
video of me surfing.

1254
01:46:19,092 --> 01:46:22,589
- Alright, man? Get some rest. Go
with the flow. - Alright, Buff.

1255
01:46:24,549 --> 01:46:25,948
Hey, George.

1256
01:46:28,773 --> 01:46:30,098
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1257
01:46:54,145 --> 01:46:57,603
- They let you out?
- Yeah, of course they let me out.

1258
01:46:59,155 --> 01:47:01,082
Chickenshits.

1259
01:47:03,055 --> 01:47:06,720
I gotta pay some class
C misdemeanor ticket.

1260
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:16,571
So did I call it or did I call it?

1261
01:47:18,229 --> 01:47:20,711
She spent the night, didn't she? Hm?

1262
01:47:25,765 --> 01:47:30,204
Oh, that sucks for you, pal.

1263
01:47:31,794 --> 01:47:33,578
Oh, shit.

1264
01:47:34,219 --> 01:47:36,065
You lied to me.

1265
01:47:41,488 --> 01:47:47,799
You want to know what your problem is,
Jeff? You want to believe so bad,

1266
01:47:48,216 --> 01:47:52,701
you'll buy anything. It's true.
Look at you.

1267
01:47:54,142 --> 01:47:59,899
- You're gullible and you're gutless.
- No, no. That's not the way it is at all.

1268
01:48:01,066 --> 01:48:08,377
No, I stayed up all night trying to
figure out how to protect my best friend.

1269
01:48:09,281 --> 01:48:12,622
Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to
come up with some lie so that

1270
01:48:12,634 --> 01:48:15,986
you wouldn't have to go to jail
for the rest of your life.

1271
01:48:16,047 --> 01:48:20,769
- Wow. You did that for me?
- Yes.

1272
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:27,053
Well, you know, all I can say is,

1273
01:48:28,181 --> 01:48:30,761
you're a fucking fool.

1274
01:48:32,254 --> 01:48:37,096
Why? Because I give a shit?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?

1275
01:48:37,097 --> 01:48:39,982
Oh, Jeff, give me a break.
You didn't even

1276
01:48:39,994 --> 01:48:42,890
have the guts to go look
in the van, did you?

1277
01:48:43,785 --> 01:48:51,826
You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to
me. You lied to me because you're gutless.

1278
01:48:51,827 --> 01:48:55,371
You're a gutless, drunken looser.

1279
01:48:58,150 --> 01:48:59,878
I'm a loser.

1280
01:49:01,429 --> 01:49:03,307
And I'm drunk.

1281
01:49:05,771 --> 01:49:07,821
But I'm not gutless.

1282
01:49:12,128 --> 01:49:14,462
You know, and what are you
doing here in the first

1283
01:49:14,474 --> 01:49:16,820
place, man? He's just gonna
call the cops again.

1284
01:49:16,844 --> 01:49:19,277
- Good, good. I, I hope he does.
- The sun

1285
01:49:19,289 --> 01:49:21,734
hasn't even come up yet
and you're drinking.

1286
01:49:21,998 --> 01:49:24,416
Hey, you saw that brown bitch
point a gun at me last

1287
01:49:24,428 --> 01:49:26,798
night, man. Did you think
she was gonna use it?

1288
01:49:27,345 --> 01:49:30,042
Did you think she was gonna use it?

1289
01:49:30,112 --> 01:49:31,741
I don't know.

1290
01:49:31,742 --> 01:49:34,270
- You don't know?
- Come on.

1291
01:49:35,017 --> 01:49:37,314
You don't think that
after they called the

1292
01:49:37,326 --> 01:49:39,634
cops on me, her and
Mohammed had a nice laugh?

1293
01:49:39,635 --> 01:49:42,368
- No.
- No?

1294
01:49:50,690 --> 01:49:56,158
I disagree. I think they did. I think
they probably went home last night and,

1295
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,971
you know, kicked off their
sandals and had a nice

1296
01:49:58,983 --> 01:50:01,806
laugh about the drunk on
the corner, you know?

1297
01:50:04,827 --> 01:50:07,145
Makes me sick.

1298
01:50:08,364 --> 01:50:10,217
What are, what are you doing?

1299
01:50:17,207 --> 01:50:24,174
Look, Tim, just go home. Alright.
Go home and sleep it off.

1300
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:29,071
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off?
My life?

1301
01:50:31,501 --> 01:50:33,599
You know, I'm supposed
to go home and go to

1302
01:50:33,611 --> 01:50:35,720
sleep and when I wake
up, what'll I be, Jeff?

1303
01:50:35,981 --> 01:50:43,366
A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback
or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right?

1304
01:50:44,799 --> 01:50:49,196
- I don't think so, man.
- Just go home, alright?

1305
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:51,592
This is my home.

1306
01:50:56,184 --> 01:51:00,018
Why, why did you start this in the
first place, man? They never hurt you.

1307
01:51:00,019 --> 01:51:03,621
They never hurt me? They hurt me
every day with their attitude.

1308
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:08,426
You know, like they even have a right.
Who the fuck do they think they are?

1309
01:51:09,622 --> 01:51:15,183
Let me tell you something, I was
born here. Alright? I'm an American.

1310
01:51:15,962 --> 01:51:19,665
And I'm owed something.
Look, they took it from me.

1311
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:23,409
They're just people. Alright?
They got feelings, you know?

1312
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:28,146
What about my feelings? What
about my fucking feelings?

1313
01:51:30,181 --> 01:51:34,315
These assholes, they come over here,
they know all the answers, right?

1314
01:51:35,049 --> 01:51:36,785
Well, they don't know shit.

1315
01:51:37,189 --> 01:51:38,990
- Will you just put the gun down?
- No.

1316
01:51:38,991 --> 01:51:41,896
- Just put it down.
- What is this... now, huh?

1317
01:51:42,138 --> 01:51:47,136
- Jeff, stay there.
- He's got a gun. He's got a gun.

1318
01:51:47,817 --> 01:51:50,689
Well, then, there now, why don't
you go inside and call the

1319
01:51:50,701 --> 01:51:53,584
cops and I'll come in there and
blow your fucking brains out.

1320
01:51:53,585 --> 01:51:57,448
Why should I call the police, huh?
They don't so any good.

1321
01:51:57,606 --> 01:52:00,687
Well, you gotta call your wife
then, you know, 'cause she kind of

1322
01:52:00,688 --> 01:52:02,857
handles these heavy
matters anyway, right?

1323
01:52:02,869 --> 01:52:05,049
No. No, you see, I don't
have to call my wife.

1324
01:52:08,723 --> 01:52:12,494
- Well, what about this?
- What about this, huh?

1325
01:52:13,082 --> 01:52:15,763
Go ahead, big man.

1326
01:52:16,164 --> 01:52:19,292
- Camel jockey.
- You know, why do you call me names?

1327
01:52:19,293 --> 01:52:21,535
- You know, I never hurt you.
I'm only working

1328
01:52:21,547 --> 01:52:23,801
here. - Yeah, yeah. That's
the fucking problem.

1329
01:52:23,802 --> 01:52:25,935
No, wait, wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

1330
01:52:26,066 --> 01:52:28,847
- What is your name?
- Look, why do you care, huh?

1331
01:52:29,129 --> 01:52:32,694
Because maybe if we know each other's
names, things wouldn't get like this.

1332
01:52:32,716 --> 01:52:34,607
- My name's Jeff.
- Okay. Nazeer, okay?

1333
01:52:34,608 --> 01:52:37,117
- Nazeer what?
- Nazeer Chaudry!

1334
01:52:37,152 --> 01:52:40,140
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's
hiring, you know? Get an application?

1335
01:52:40,141 --> 01:52:43,681
- That, that's Indian?
- Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.

1336
01:52:43,838 --> 01:52:46,791
Alright, alright, enough
with the Boy Scout routine.

1337
01:52:48,227 --> 01:52:51,401
- Please. Look...
- Please?

1338
01:52:51,702 --> 01:52:55,034
- Look, look, just get off my property.
- What?

1339
01:52:55,035 --> 01:53:00,754
- Look, get down off my property.
- Why? What are you gonna do? Huh?

1340
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:04,172
You're gonna shoot me for standing
on your fucking trash can?

1341
01:53:04,173 --> 01:53:08,271
- Get off my property!
- Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.

1342
01:53:08,272 --> 01:53:10,842
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.

1343
01:53:10,843 --> 01:53:14,213
- Go ahead! They love
you just about as much

1344
01:53:14,225 --> 01:53:17,607
as I do. - Tim, can we go?
This is ridiculous.

1345
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:25,408
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!

1346
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:30,828
Get off my fucking roof, you
fucking drunk! You bum!

1347
01:53:30,829 --> 01:53:33,910
Oh, there you are, honey. We were
waiting for you. What happened?

1348
01:53:34,593 --> 01:53:38,101
- Look, get down now, you fucking drunk!
You bum! - You know what? Go ahead

1349
01:53:38,113 --> 01:53:41,620
and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me!
Come on! Come on, man! Come on!

1350
01:53:42,257 --> 01:53:44,229
Get off my roof!

1351
01:53:45,801 --> 01:53:49,527
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!

1352
01:53:50,188 --> 01:53:51,872
Look; okay, come on. Look,
what are you doing? Look,

1353
01:53:51,884 --> 01:53:53,579
that's enough. My wife called the police.
They're coming.

1354
01:53:53,662 --> 01:53:57,167
Jeff! Come up here!

1355
01:53:57,706 --> 01:53:59,022
Is that Bee-Bee?

1356
01:53:59,057 --> 01:54:00,641
Come on!

1357
01:54:01,144 --> 01:54:03,799
Look, look, you see? They were
drinking on the roof and,

1358
01:54:03,823 --> 01:54:06,899
what, is she drunk? J-just get her off!

1359
01:54:16,825 --> 01:54:18,661
What are you saying?

1360
01:54:19,829 --> 01:54:21,141
Ready?

1361
01:54:22,858 --> 01:54:24,458
What are you saying? Please...

1362
01:54:24,659 --> 01:54:28,414
You got her? Fuck.

1363
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:32,967
- I hope you're happy!
- This has nothing to do with me.

1364
01:54:33,322 --> 01:54:36,593
- This, uh, drinking, yeah.
- No, this has everything to do with you.

1365
01:54:36,617 --> 01:54:38,617
No, no, she went up by herself.
This was not my responsibility.

1366
01:54:39,194 --> 01:54:41,375
Hey it's your roof. It's
your fucking problem.

1367
01:54:43,163 --> 01:54:46,291
Hi, uh, there's an emergency down
at the Circle A on first Street.

1368
01:54:47,463 --> 01:54:50,876
Okay. You're fucked now, pal!
Um, send an ambulance

1369
01:54:50,888 --> 01:54:54,313
'cause I, I think it's an
overdose or something. Okay.

1370
01:54:54,714 --> 01:54:56,614
Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here.

1371
01:54:56,615 --> 01:54:58,864
I'm gonna go over to Scuff's
and see if he's got his truck.

1372
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:01,107
Listen, if she dies, you're
gonna be so sorry that

1373
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:03,288
you ever showed your
brown face in this town!

1374
01:55:03,289 --> 01:55:06,420
This has nothing to do with me!
She went up by herself.

1375
01:55:11,872 --> 01:55:16,097
Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof!
They can't go on the roof!

1376
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:25,763
- How is she?
- I don't know.

1377
01:55:26,737 --> 01:55:31,744
- I think she's breathing. - Okay.
Okay, look my wife called the police.

1378
01:55:31,745 --> 01:55:36,450
They're coming. It's not too late.
They'll come, they'll take care of her.

1379
01:55:36,976 --> 01:55:39,856
I'm going inside. Oh, God.

1380
01:55:43,411 --> 01:55:48,804
You people are so stupid!
What's wrong with you?!

1381
01:55:52,885 --> 01:55:58,341
Throw it all away, huh?!
You throw it all away!

1382
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:18,737
