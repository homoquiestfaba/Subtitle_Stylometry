1
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,353
30 seconds left to see the Bears.

2
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:28,119
And the Bears take out the Packers,
40--

3
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:29,585
You really think people

4
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:31,176
will still...

5
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:33,307
Yes, some people still have hope

6
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:34,806
.. no
hope from the beginning.

7
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:36,579
You
never know what will happen.

8
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,746
They may be down, but I can see
them doing the right things.

9
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:43,482
ate
up the Packer's offense

10
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:44,637
all day long.

11
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:47,209
Well we
heard that several times today.

12
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:49,863
And
you will hear it all week,

13
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:52,955
as the Packers were heavy favorites.

14
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,481
It seems
like they have been limited.

15
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,719
Sometimes no matter how hard you try,

16
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,243
you're just up against it.

17
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:00,852
If I didn't know any better.

18
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,469
Be careful now.

19
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:03,396
I'm not insinuating--

20
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,370
♫ My head against the window pane

21
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,537
♫ Watch the sky and the falling rain

22
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:03,154
♫ I can't stop thinking of you

23
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:08,591
♫ I watched you walk
off the plane that day

24
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:10,674
♫ My body couldn't move

25
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,174
- Hey, Tommy, man!

26
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:17,666
♫ Those words that will get
you to stay here with me

27
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:21,132
Hey!

28
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,348
- What the hell are you doing here?

29
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:23,440
- Take this bag.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,320
You know you're
not supposed to be here.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,040
- I know, I know.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,540
Just take the bag.

33
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,423
- It better be good.

34
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,840
- Come on, Tommy.

35
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:35,990
You're not supposed to be here.

36
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,294
- I know, I know.

37
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:38,127
Get the hell out.

38
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:39,540
- I'm leaving, man, I'm leaving.

39
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,040
I'm leaving, okay?

40
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,350
- This a party?

41
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,692
Just get out of here.

42
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:52,049
Okay man, I'm leaving, all right?

43
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:52,966
Bye, Tommy.

44
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:04,204
Idiot.

45
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:23,130
Count it.

46
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:27,210
I don't need
to take this from you.

47
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,109
You sound like some sort of kid.

48
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,935
You need to tell Harry
that I'm good for it.

49
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:33,328
- Harry says it's time.

50
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:34,688
I've asked him in the past.

51
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:36,160
I know what he's gonna say.

52
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,131
No.

53
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:38,735
Ask him again.

54
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:41,597
Listen, kid, don't mess with me.

55
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,014
Harry knows me, just ask him.

56
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:49,624
- Okay, listen.

57
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:52,843
Harry says you're good for it.

58
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:55,704
I'll see you in two days.

59
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:58,121
Hey, kid, thanks.

60
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:04,250
- Get the money and don't call me kid.

61
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:09,309
Told her she shouldn't.

62
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:10,521
I tell her every time.

63
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:11,895
She's a moron.

64
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:13,221
She's high as a kite.

65
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:14,314
What am I supposed to do?

66
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,774
What are you supposed to do?

67
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:19,781
You are supposed to keep
freakin' crap like that

68
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,737
from coming around here.

69
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:23,334
That's what you're supposed to do.

70
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:27,220
You're supposed to keep morons
from coming into this place.

71
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,140
- I know, I know.

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,703
- You don't know!

73
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,014
You don't fucking know!

74
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:37,055
That fucking girl is gonna
get us done, mark my words.

75
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:40,728
If she comes down here
again, pay or no pay,

76
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:44,360
you are gonna fuckin' done her yourself.

77
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,406
And do what you got to do
to make her understand.

78
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:49,739
- I know.

79
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:51,906
- Don't say I know, again.

80
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,363
I didn't tell you to let that piece

81
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:05,449
of crap off the hook, did I?

82
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,532
- No, I didn't.

83
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:13,244
Marty, get Bertram on the line.

84
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:50,536
Hey, Marty.

85
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:53,005
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:53,838
Malcolm.

87
00:05:56,598 --> 00:05:59,515
Why don't you tell Harry
he's got your name wrong?

88
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:00,582
He's gonna keep calling you that

89
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:02,833
'til you tell him your name is Malcolm.

90
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,470
- Gina, as long as you know what it is,

91
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,176
I don't care what he calls me.

92
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:11,093
- Careful there, tiger.

93
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:14,632
We need you to call in Zeke Bertram.

94
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:15,991
She's short.

95
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:17,991
- The black girl, right?

96
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:22,704
Harry doesn't give her an inch, does he?

97
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:24,952
Does he not like the black bitches?

98
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,698
- She's mixed up in
drugs, among other things.

99
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:29,858
Harry hates that.

100
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,196
- There's money in that.

101
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:33,946
- No, there's not, not for Harry.

102
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,351
- That's good to know.

103
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:42,595
What, are you looking out for me?

104
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:45,380
Look, I know I'm new here,

105
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,380
but I know only to do what I'm told.

106
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:53,681
Okay, so how hard do you want this?

107
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:58,455
- We're still talking about Zeke, right?

108
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:01,267
Don't break anything and
stay away from her face.

109
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:04,160
She might need that to
make her money back.

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,092
- I'll see if I can fit her in tomorrow.

111
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:11,406
You know, Harry asked me
to call in some girls.

112
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:14,066
- Good, you should call Darla.

113
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,816
She'll fuck him hard.

114
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,802
You think that I'm going to get him drunk

115
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:21,907
and mess around with you?

116
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,532
- You already thought
this through, didn't you?

117
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:30,688
- I'm gonna let that slide, this time.

118
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:33,859
- You read my mind.

119
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,109
- Hey, Malcolm,

120
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,968
your shoelace is untied.

121
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:50,082
- Do you think I am stupid?

122
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:52,589
Look at you, you're just a kid.

123
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,397
- You're a moron!

124
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:19,320
This is business.

125
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,674
This isn't personal.

126
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,553
You owe, you pay.

127
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,124
- Not personal?

128
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:51,209
Not personal?

129
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:54,668
What do you know from personal?

130
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:09,141
- Listen, you messed up.

131
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,474
You placed the bets, not me.

132
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,868
If you don't think these
guys are gonna come back

133
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:17,068
to get their money,

134
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:19,502
they're gonna take it from you.

135
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,575
- Take it from me?

136
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:22,863
Take it from me?

137
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:24,727
What else could they take?

138
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,691
What else have I got?

139
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,202
- They'll come back and kill you.

140
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:30,442
- You don't know who you're messing with!

141
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:33,775
You don't know who you are messing with!

142
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,600
Do it, go ahead, shoot me!

143
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:42,226
Do it or get out of here!

144
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:51,507
- You'll be sorry.

145
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,958
You'll be sorry, who says that.

146
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,953
- I'll be sorry?

147
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,617
A P-38 Card?

148
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:18,117
Shit, he's a cop.

149
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:12,947
- You worry too much.

150
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,637
Thursday, 4:48.

151
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,913
Derrick,
this is Captain Donovan.

152
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:31,033
Listen, we don't usually ask.

153
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:34,847
Well, something just came to my attention.

154
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,032
I know you're listed as an undercover,

155
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:40,031
but it's not like you're a
special agent or anything.

156
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:41,433
I need you to come down to the station,

157
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,020
so we can address this.

158
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,716
It's very important that
you come down right away.

159
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:47,633
Right away.

160
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:52,159
I'm pretty sure you may have
an idea of what it's about.

161
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,246
Be in my office first thing.

162
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,798
- Hello.

163
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:07,064
Well, what are you doing here?

164
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:08,495
What am I doing here?

165
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,109
- Yeah, what are you doing here?

166
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,567
Get thee out.

167
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,734
You smell of, of the shit!

168
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:18,849
Now the church is closed.

169
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:21,656
Are you on drugs or something?

170
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:25,823
If you don't move, I'm
gonna call the police.

171
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:29,805
Or I'll kick your ass off
these stairs, me self.

172
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,742
Now you need to get your shit together.

173
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:35,659
You need to get your shit together!

174
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,929
I don't know, it was midnight.

175
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:17,907
- He's on suspension.

176
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:20,214
Oh, and if he still wants
to talk about that overtime,

177
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,733
you tell him to come down and see me.

178
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,566
I'll fire his ass.

179
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,793
Captain.

180
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:32,818
- I know it's your wallet.

181
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:34,651
What's wrong with you?

182
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:38,592
Being undercover means not screwing up.

183
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:40,787
You screw up, and you're
gonna get someone killed.

184
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:43,370
And you, Detective, screwed up.

185
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,245
We were gonna just chuck the damn thing

186
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,062
when we came across your P-Card.

187
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:54,364
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is

188
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:55,844
if someone got a hold of that?

189
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:59,362
Do you have any idea how
dangerous it would be

190
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:02,048
if they found out our
undercovers carry these?

191
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,350
Are you an idiot?

192
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,736
We may have to change the whole way

193
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:08,903
we identify the undercovers
now because of this.

194
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:11,096
- I'm sorry, Captain.

195
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,718
Where'd they get it?

196
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:18,370
- A store owner called it in,

197
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,037
said a customer saw you drop it.

198
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:26,512
- Can I go now?

199
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:33,682
- Send him in.

200
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:39,946
Captain Donovan here.

201
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,865
Yes, sir.

202
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:48,050
Yes.

203
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:51,221
Yes, sir.

204
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,942
Yes, I'm dealing with that right now, sir.

205
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:00,705
Okay.

206
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,315
I'll call you back in about 10 minutes.

207
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,148
Thank you.

208
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:12,806
You know, you've been with
this department as a detective

209
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:15,473
for a long time, real long time.

210
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,262
After what happened...

211
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:27,570
This is Special Agent Greene.

212
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,607
We borrowed him from the
internal affairs office,

213
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,020
about six months ago,

214
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,270
and he's been working
undercover for us since then.

215
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,603
I told you this was serious.

216
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:43,597
- A kid?

217
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:47,709
- Yeah, he is.

218
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,768
But he's also a special agent at 20.

219
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:51,906
I would think you could appreciate that,

220
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:54,395
considering you couldn't do
it for the last seven years.

221
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:55,228
- Six.

222
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:57,853
- Seven, but more importantly,

223
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:00,603
I think you know what that means.

224
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:05,320
Look, you've only got one choice here.

225
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,114
Can I see your badge?

226
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:31,378
Congratulations, Special Agent Forrest.

227
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:37,447
- What?

228
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:41,941
- You are no longer a lowly detective.

229
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:45,440
What, you're not happy?

230
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,273
- No, no.

231
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:48,594
Sir, it's great.

232
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,265
Forgive me, Captain.

233
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:57,061
What is he doing here, again?

234
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:59,100
I don't understand.

235
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,962
- He is your new partner.

236
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:04,820
Special Agent Greene, please
meet Special Agent Forrest.

237
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,699
Look, you have to have a partner.

238
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:10,618
It's just the way it is
when you start out as an SA.

239
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:14,785
I wanted the two of you to
meet, so you could get cracking.

240
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:18,512
He's been working the numbers
for a while now for Harry.

241
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:20,345
One of Harry's clients last week decided

242
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,580
to beat the crap out of him.

243
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,073
He was on the fast track with him,

244
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:26,823
but it's not looking so good now.

245
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:31,244
- Evidently, they say I look like a kid.

246
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,487
It's hard to get them to trust you

247
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:36,404
when they think of you as some kid.

248
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,559
- And that's where you fit in.

249
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,920
We need you in there working with them,

250
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,694
and he thinks he has a way
he can do that for you.

251
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,959
I don't know, and I don't want to know.

252
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,807
As long as it's mostly legal

253
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:51,980
and doesn't come back
to bite me in the ass.

254
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,137
That's all I care about.

255
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:55,387
- I don't know.

256
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:59,163
I mean, I don't know.

257
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:03,330
Derrick, these might be
the guys, the guys.

258
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:05,298
I mean, I'm not sure, not sure.

259
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,381
But they might be the guys, the guys.

260
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,588
- You were right.

261
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,271
I didn't know who I was messing with.

262
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:32,981
It's a mistake I shouldn't have made.

263
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:35,314
But I did, and you did, too.

264
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:38,599
- What's your game?

265
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,432
- No game.

266
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:43,989
- You didn't turn me in.

267
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:45,489
What for?

268
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:53,350
- For beating the crap out of you.

269
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,469
- Maybe I was wrong.

270
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:56,219
Maybe you don't know.

271
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,685
- For being a dirty cop.

272
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,980
- For being a dirty cop,

273
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:19,465
I figure there's two
things we can do here,

274
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:21,882
go back, tell 'em everything.

275
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:25,084
You lawyer up pretty fast.

276
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:29,281
I go down as the guy who turned on a cop,

277
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,781
or worse, a guy who fried his own partner.

278
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:39,091
Or maybe you can straighten
your ass out and be my partner.

279
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,075
Stop the gambling.

280
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:44,575
Stop the drinking.

281
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,194
- And what if I can't?

282
00:22:48,194 --> 00:22:49,420
- I already told you.

283
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,202
I go down as the guy who
fried his own partner,

284
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,619
and I will do it.

285
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:58,927
- Why are you doing this?

286
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,186
- As messed up as it sounds,

287
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:04,938
you're the only one I can trust.

288
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:07,034
You're gonna do what I say.

289
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,617
If you don't, you're gonna fry.

290
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:13,134
That, and I know what happened.

291
00:23:13,134 --> 00:23:15,721
That's none of your business.

292
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:16,603
- You're right.

293
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,686
It's none of my business.

294
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,784
I told you you'd be sorry.

295
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,137
Don't call me kid.

296
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:37,670
Hey, Harry.

297
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,429
Yeah, I'm leaving there now.

298
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:41,864
You won't believe it.

299
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:44,709
He came up with all 50Gs.

300
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:45,542
Yeah.

301
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:49,891
Yeah, hey, I got a favor to ask you.

302
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:10,065
- Hey, I need just a
little bit, just a little.

303
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:15,509
Please.

304
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,533
Please.

305
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,933
Zeke.

306
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:19,530
- Hey, Thornton, you all right?

307
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,780
- Hey, Zeke, Zekey Malekey!

308
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:25,898
You are the all right, Zeke?

309
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:27,815
You make the all right?

310
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:31,678
- Not today, Thorn, not today.

311
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:35,678
- When a problem comes
along, you are the fixer.

312
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:41,437
- This time, I'm the one in trouble.

313
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:45,714
- No, tell me, I'm the doctor.

314
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:50,075
Now tell me and let me help you.

315
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:53,298
- I need money, bad.

316
00:25:55,374 --> 00:25:56,207
Memphis,

317
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,670
she's in a bad place.

318
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,168
If I could get some money,

319
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:07,967
I could get her through this

320
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:11,718
and get her clean.

321
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:13,718
- She can have my brush.

322
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:51,965
♫ I rose to war

323
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,656
♫ I did her right back all day

324
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:08,689
♫ I want to give her two sorry I coulds

325
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,504
♫ Before I left there on my way

326
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:16,504
- You can learn a thing
or two from Darla here.

327
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:21,504
♫ Heavy like a mountain

328
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:25,668
♫ Heavy like a mountain

329
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:29,700
- You can do so much better
than her, Hairy Balls.

330
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,533
I know.

331
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,775
♫ I went to watch my memories

332
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:42,208
♫ Heavy like a mountain

333
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:46,116
- I know what Daddy likes.

334
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:58,631
- Are you leaving?

335
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,927
In that case, you know he's fair game.

336
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,712
- Treat him right.

337
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:11,879
♫ I never feel the troublin' days

338
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,016
- It's all there?

339
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:08,975
- Yeah.

340
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:15,085
- You know, last month, the
boss had to front Harry 10K.

341
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:17,593
This has it.

342
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:28,459
- What's going on in there?

343
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,144
- Cops tell us more than you know.

344
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:35,555
- Like?

345
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:36,388
- Like?

346
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:38,618
Worry about you.

347
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:41,715
I'm worried about you.

348
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:46,650
What?

349
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:50,444
- I need to talk to him.

350
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:53,916
- Was everything there?

351
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:54,749
- Yes.

352
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:01,416
You don't need to discuss with him.

353
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,377
You don't need to discuss it with him.

354
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:10,281
Now you may want to, but
there's a big difference

355
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:12,114
between that and this.

356
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,925
Harry talks to him.

357
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:17,669
Know Your place.

358
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,069
Your place.

359
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,696
- You're one to talk.

360
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:30,198
- Yeah, what'd you say?

361
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:33,152
- Nothing.

362
00:30:33,152 --> 00:30:36,652
Nothing, yeah.

363
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:44,390
- It's just that

364
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,783
things are gonna be run
a little bit differently

365
00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:49,031
when I'm in charge.

366
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:49,864
- You?

367
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,541
You fuckin' mental?

368
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:56,777
- I'm just kidding.

369
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,939
- Don't kid, Tommy.

370
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:04,981
You and me, we got a simple job here.

371
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:09,033
And the world is full of dead kidders.

372
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:13,482
Do your job, don't get smart.

373
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:17,617
- I think you need to lighten up.

374
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,020
- Tommy!

375
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:28,323
I can't wait 'til they send me for you.

376
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:31,882
- I'll see you then.

377
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:37,349
Bye, Father.

378
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:39,599
- Bye, guys, off to school.

379
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:54,384
- Good morning, Father.

380
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:57,062
- Good morning, Father.

381
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:58,312
- Good morning.

382
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,176
- I picked up your mail and put it

383
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:11,811
in your room, your front hall.

384
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:12,644
- Oh.

385
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:16,077
- It looks like there's a package

386
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:18,037
from the mission in Columbia.

387
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,651
Saw the parish hall is closed again.

388
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:21,891
- Yeah, I've got to keep
the parishioners out

389
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:22,883
of there right now.

390
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:26,673
There's, there's a guy sent
in for some papers on those,

391
00:32:26,673 --> 00:32:29,626
but there's something
wrong with the pipes.

392
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:32,952
- I could call a plumber
for you or something.

393
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,243
- No, no, it'll be fine.

394
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,993
No, it's okay, Sasha.

395
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:43,605
Oh God.

396
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:07,415
- Hey, I found these the other day.

397
00:33:07,415 --> 00:33:09,665
Danny Gasco, is this yours?

398
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:14,179
- Danny.

399
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:15,012
- Damn.

400
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:17,640
Didn't you go
to Cleveland High School?

401
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,807
- You asked me if I was Shay
Greene or Grain, and I'm not.

402
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,381
I'm glad you stopped me, though.

403
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:26,654
- You are?

404
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:28,679
- Yeah, I saw you, the other day.

405
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,392
- Oh, you did, did you?

406
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:34,027
- Yeah, I realized I
hadn't informed you yet.

407
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:35,795
- Informed me?

408
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,694
- I'm sorry, I legally
have to say it like this.

409
00:33:38,694 --> 00:33:42,861
Hi, I'm Danny Gasco, and I'm
a registered sex offender.

410
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:45,981
And I've moved into the building.

411
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:47,421
- Oh.

412
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:50,338
- It's nice to see a friendly face.

413
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:54,118
Maybe we can get coffee sometime?

414
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:56,201
- I'm all set but thanks.

415
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:31,860
- What are you doing here?

416
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,949
- Hold on, baby, I didn't mean

417
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,218
to cause you any--
- Don't talk to me

418
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:35,403
like you talk to Harry.

419
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:36,867
Where is he?

420
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,830
- Harry's out, too drunk
to know any better.

421
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,843
- Tommy?

422
00:34:40,843 --> 00:34:43,062
- Making his run.

423
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:44,563
Your mouth wants to play it safe,

424
00:34:44,563 --> 00:34:47,123
but something else seems to
have a different opinion.

425
00:34:47,123 --> 00:34:48,373
- Are you sure?

426
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:51,113
- I'm pretty sure.

427
00:34:51,113 --> 00:34:52,544
- Are you sure?

428
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:03,439
- And now I'm really sure.

429
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,781
Time's up, I have to go.

430
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:09,614
- Stop.

431
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:10,864
- I have to go.

432
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,057
You're gonna have to
fight harder than that.

433
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,580
You're a mess.

434
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,181
I'm a mess?

435
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:57,785
At least I'm not as bad as Stevens.

436
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,722
That man's a bleeder.

437
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:03,889
Yeah, well, let's
see how wasted they are.

438
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:06,424
Mr. Fissolino?

439
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:21,527
- You pay them hoo-has, Marty?

440
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:23,651
- Yeah.

441
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:27,043
- Where is she?

442
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:29,959
- Who?

443
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:33,239
Gina?

444
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:37,638
Probably your place.

445
00:36:37,638 --> 00:36:39,265
- Did you pay them?

446
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:40,098
- Yeah.

447
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:42,437
Yeah, I paid them.

448
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:45,733
Was I good, ladies?

449
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:49,361
The best, Harry.

450
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:52,778
- Harris, Jake, you take care of Stevens?

451
00:36:55,598 --> 00:36:56,431
Good.

452
00:36:57,513 --> 00:37:00,096
A shame, fuckin' dealing drugs.

453
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:06,311
Ladies, did Marty pay you
enough to take care of my boys?

454
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,127
- For you, anything.

455
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:11,287
- What are you doing here?

456
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,120
Get out of here.

457
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,453
Marty, get them out of here!

458
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:21,976
- Thank you, Mr. Fisso, Fissoline.

459
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:26,400
- Shh, we're gonna
party again soon, Harry.

460
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,843
- Bye, Harry.

461
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,877
♫ I am coming to get you

462
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:37,915
- Darling, you'll waste your time.

463
00:37:37,915 --> 00:37:40,914
- Sorry, you'll waste your time.

464
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:43,268
It's a little turtle in a little shell,

465
00:37:43,268 --> 00:37:45,351
nothing gonna get it out.

466
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:48,230
- Stay there.

467
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:53,993
- I just came to talk to him.

468
00:37:53,993 --> 00:37:57,484
- You just need to back your ass up.

469
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:00,407
- For God sakes, everybody, calm down.

470
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:01,240
Harry, Mephis..

471
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:05,172
She's a rat.

472
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:06,556
She needs help.

473
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:11,696
Frisk her.

474
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:18,331
♫ Turn back to

475
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:23,115
♫ Encourage that truth

476
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:24,889
- She's clean.

477
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:26,922
No wire on her.

478
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:29,839
- Not unless they're inside of her.

479
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:33,842
- You come here!

480
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:39,886
She needs--

481
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:41,141
- She needs!

482
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:42,808
She needs, my needs!

483
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:47,003
You owe, she owes!

484
00:38:47,003 --> 00:38:48,530
Everybody owes.

485
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,530
I don't owe.

486
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:51,965
I know what she needs.

487
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,652
I gave it to her.

488
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:55,708
Now I can't give her nothing.

489
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,776
- Harry, Memphis is--

490
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:59,526
- Her name is Memory.

491
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:03,902
Don't come pukin' that
street crap, bullshit names

492
00:39:03,902 --> 00:39:05,749
into this place.

493
00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:08,053
No more of this Memphis crap.

494
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:13,328
Oh, you think you can fix her?

495
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:15,402
Marty.

496
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:18,341
- It's Malcolm.

497
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,608
- What?

498
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,472
- It's Malcolm.

499
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:23,202
You keep calling me Marty.

500
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:24,873
People are starting to call me Marty.

501
00:39:24,873 --> 00:39:26,124
It's Malcolm.

502
00:39:26,124 --> 00:39:29,011
- Marty, Malcolm, Maurice,

503
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:31,673
who gives a crap about your goddam name?

504
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:33,423
Your name, your name.

505
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:38,301
Well, you don't know shit
about friskin', Marty.

506
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:43,537
You gotta search 'em inside and out.

507
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:53,401
Help me, help me, please.

508
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:56,549
Help me.

509
00:40:00,673 --> 00:40:02,006
Help me, please.

510
00:40:04,847 --> 00:40:08,205
Help me.

511
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,955
- You gonna kill her?

512
00:40:13,153 --> 00:40:15,903
I'll call for cleanup if you are.

513
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:23,406
- No.

514
00:40:45,394 --> 00:40:47,016
- Hey, Malcolm.

515
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:47,849
- Hey.

516
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,700
- You take care of the girls all right?

517
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,702
- Yup.

518
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,143
He sure couldn't.

519
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:55,310
- What's that?

520
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:57,684
- Nothin'.

521
00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:03,347
- What's going on?

522
00:41:03,347 --> 00:41:04,447
- I think he's pissed.

523
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,678
In there with some whore, I think.

524
00:41:06,678 --> 00:41:07,852
- Who?

525
00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:08,771
Darla?

526
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:11,354
- I don't know, didn't see her.

527
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:15,196
- He all right in there?

528
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:16,328
- Yeah, he yelled out.

529
00:41:16,328 --> 00:41:18,828
Said he could take care of it.

530
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,262
- All right.

531
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:22,595
- Who's Memphis?

532
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:26,744
- Memphis?

533
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:29,713
She have blonde hair?

534
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:31,958
- No, I told you, I didn't see her.

535
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,375
Her name came up.

536
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:36,294
- Memphis?
- Yeah.

537
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,211
Who is she?

538
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,085
- Memphis is a drug addict.

539
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:43,446
Do yourself a favor.

540
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:46,120
Stick to running the books.

541
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,012
Dealing's the fastest way out of Harry's.

542
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:52,429
What's he calling you, Marty?

543
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:55,575
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

544
00:42:03,947 --> 00:42:04,780
Yeah, hey.

545
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:08,968
Tommy, I need to
talk to you about this guy.

546
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,781
Who?

547
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:13,855
- The one I told Harry about, a favor.

548
00:42:13,855 --> 00:42:16,105
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

549
00:42:17,426 --> 00:42:18,259
- He's a friend of mine.

550
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:21,147
Harry wants you to meet him.

551
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:22,897
Yeah, sure.

552
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:25,131
- Okay, so when?

553
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:27,214
- When what?

554
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,421
Uh, yeah, um,

555
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:34,858
bring him by my place
tomorrow morning, seven.

556
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,774
- Zeke, Zeke!

557
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:46,740
What happened?

558
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,573
What are you doing?

559
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:48,606
- Sorry.

560
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:49,900
She needs help.

561
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,733
- Harry?

562
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:53,274
Why, why?

563
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:54,191
- You know.

564
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:56,361
- I will, I--

565
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:57,294
- No.
- I will!

566
00:42:57,294 --> 00:43:00,174
- No, no, not for me, not for me.

567
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:01,757
- Zeke, I love you.

568
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:05,450
- You can't, you can't!

569
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:09,286
- Why?

570
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:22,739
- I love her more.

571
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:38,745
- What did she do?

572
00:43:38,745 --> 00:43:40,993
- I know, not now.

573
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,906
There is a job to do.

574
00:43:42,906 --> 00:43:44,585
- Oh what the fuck, Harry!

575
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:45,918
- A serious job!

576
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,053
Days like today,

577
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:51,486
this is crap.

578
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,038
I wish it was just all over.

579
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:56,739
I wish I was dead.

580
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,468
- What the hell is going on?

581
00:43:58,468 --> 00:43:59,891
- Malcolm's been stealing.

582
00:43:59,891 --> 00:44:00,724
- Malcolm?

583
00:44:02,418 --> 00:44:03,607
Malcolm, Malcolm?

584
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,904
Marty, Malcolm, that just left?

585
00:44:06,904 --> 00:44:08,276
How did you--

586
00:44:08,276 --> 00:44:09,718
- I know.

587
00:44:09,718 --> 00:44:12,635
It's about trust, it's about trust.

588
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
I need you to finish it,

589
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,835
like we finished Stevens.

590
00:44:24,669 --> 00:44:26,700
- When we talking?

591
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,554
No rush, whenever,

592
00:44:29,554 --> 00:44:31,887
but before he takes anymore.

593
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:35,387
- What happened with Zeke?

594
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:39,696
- I need...

595
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,519
Zeke and Memory--

596
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:44,352
- What?

597
00:44:45,738 --> 00:44:47,655
I don't know.

598
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:50,034
Stevens them.

599
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,743
- Kill 'em, kill them?

600
00:44:56,748 --> 00:45:00,144
You want me to off Memphis, Memory?

601
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:02,144
- What's wrong with you?

602
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:04,235
- What's--

603
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:07,062
- You know better than to say that, Tom.

604
00:45:07,062 --> 00:45:08,728
Go find Memory.

605
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:09,811
Go find Zeke.

606
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,869
Pick up some poison, grab a gun,

607
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:16,575
grab a knife, grab a goddamn candlestick,

608
00:45:16,575 --> 00:45:18,242
I don't give a fuck!

609
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:21,784
And kill them both.

610
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:25,598
And when you're done,

611
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:30,924
go skip off and play
with yourself somewhere.

612
00:45:30,924 --> 00:45:32,841
Do I make myself clear?

613
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:36,051
- Christ's sake, Harry.

614
00:45:36,986 --> 00:45:40,153
- You don't want anymore explanations.

615
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:43,560
If you don't understand,

616
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,100
I can find a retard to explain it to you.

617
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,350
- No, I got it.

618
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,942
Where's Gina?

619
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:53,480
- Hell if I know.

620
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,666
- I've been trying to send
her these text messages.

621
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:57,622
I don't know.

622
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,462
What's with this thing?

623
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:03,955
They can kiss my bare bodkin.

624
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:09,079
That's what they can do.

625
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,850
I can't continue with this.

626
00:46:54,568 --> 00:46:57,651
- You got that package from Columbia?

627
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:01,667
I saw that bitch deliver it.

628
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,270
You bring it to me, okay.

629
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,941
That's our deal.

630
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:10,721
Okay, I don't know what's gotten into you.

631
00:47:10,721 --> 00:47:13,662
You've given me a dozen of these packages.

632
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:17,681
It's not my fault your packages
aren't searched by the feds.

633
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:20,004
Just because you saw what was inside,

634
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,441
there's no reason to get
bold and tighten that collar.

635
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,205
- I didn't know what was in them.

636
00:47:25,205 --> 00:47:26,259
It could've been anything.

637
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:28,953
- You can lie to yourself all you want.

638
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:31,120
You drop off that package,

639
00:47:32,341 --> 00:47:35,240
or I tell your secret, lover boy.

640
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,907
- Don't you talk to him, Father.

641
00:47:40,262 --> 00:47:41,728
- My God, what have you done?

642
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:42,821
- Nothing.

643
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:44,626
- That's right, Father, nothing.

644
00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:46,609
- Zeke, you're gonna get
your ass beaten again

645
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:47,442
if you say .

646
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:49,417
- All I needed to do is help her, Marty.

647
00:47:49,417 --> 00:47:51,422
- Don't, don't you fuckin' call me that.

648
00:47:51,422 --> 00:47:53,456
- Just needed to get her better.

649
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:54,930
- I didn't do anything.

650
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,049
You let him.

651
00:47:56,049 --> 00:47:56,896
- You let him what?

652
00:47:56,896 --> 00:47:57,729
Who did this?

653
00:47:57,729 --> 00:48:00,176
Who did this to you?
- You need to shut your mouth!

654
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:02,013
- That's right, you didn't do nothing.

655
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:03,088
I've seen you.

656
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,256
You walking selling
drugs to the little kids.

657
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:06,929
Is that what you are doing here?

658
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:10,189
- My God, is that how you found out?

659
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:11,716
- I can help you.

660
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:12,974
Go to hell, devil!

661
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,681
- No, I can get what you need for her.

662
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:17,646
Look, I could help you.

663
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:19,554
- I think you best come with me.

664
00:48:19,554 --> 00:48:21,052
- Father, you need to stay out of this.

665
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:22,020
- No, you are wrong.

666
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,083
I will not stand for this!

667
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:26,670
- I can take care of this.

668
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:27,790
- Don't, I beg of you.

669
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,426
- I'm not gonna,

670
00:48:29,426 --> 00:48:31,009
I want to help her.

671
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:32,858
- No, Marty.

672
00:48:38,788 --> 00:48:40,131
Are you crazy?

673
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:41,619
- You watched him!

674
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,128
- What did you want me to do?

675
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:43,961
- Anything!

676
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:45,530
I wanted you to do anything.

677
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,780
- But if I did something...

678
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,996
look, the guy's an idiot.

679
00:48:49,996 --> 00:48:52,022
He doesn't even know my
fucking name, for God's sakes.

680
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:54,587
But one word from him, and
I end up in a dumpster.

681
00:48:54,587 --> 00:48:55,475
I couldn't help.

682
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:56,719
- No, you didn't.

683
00:48:56,719 --> 00:48:58,298
- I couldn't.

684
00:48:58,298 --> 00:48:59,881
But I can help now.

685
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:03,580
Okay, I have what she needs.

686
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,413
Hold on.

687
00:49:25,693 --> 00:49:28,444
Here, take this to Memphis,

688
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:32,611
and for God's sakes,
don't tell anyone, no one.

689
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,491
Okay, I don't like what Harry did.

690
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:37,831
All right, just take it.

691
00:49:37,831 --> 00:49:40,941
It's my way of saying that I'm sorry.

692
00:49:40,941 --> 00:49:42,865
It won't happen again.

693
00:49:42,865 --> 00:49:44,872
- I don't get it.

694
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:46,888
- I'm trying to be nice.

695
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:47,721
Trust me.

696
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:52,494
Maybe there's hope for
my eternal salvation yet.

697
00:49:52,494 --> 00:49:53,327
Here.

698
00:49:54,272 --> 00:49:55,439
It's not much.

699
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:57,609
Just take it.

700
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:28,647
- I'm trying, Agent Greene.

701
00:50:28,647 --> 00:50:29,480
- I know.

702
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:34,076
Take this.

703
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,148
Stop asking questions.

704
00:50:40,148 --> 00:50:41,590
And don't call me Greene.

705
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:42,939
It's Danny, Danny Gasco.

706
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,988
Yeah, sorry, I forgot.

707
00:50:45,988 --> 00:50:48,113
You go by Gasco.

708
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:51,098
- Danny, Danny G, don't
throw in last names,

709
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:53,430
Dan, Danny, Danny G.

710
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,937
- Yeah, I got it.

711
00:50:54,937 --> 00:50:55,770
- All right.

712
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,520
Now just, just stick to it, okay.

713
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:02,745
- My super secret name is Shay Greene.

714
00:51:03,884 --> 00:51:05,456
Just call me Shay.

715
00:51:05,456 --> 00:51:09,623
- Good to know you can give
it back, but seriously,

716
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,067
give me the card.

717
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,223
- What are you doing?

718
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:24,292
That's our way out.

719
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:26,209
- That's our way dead.

720
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:28,002
They know about the cards.

721
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,201
You're going into the rabbit hole,

722
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:33,368
and the only way out is you
to go all the way through it.

723
00:51:33,692 --> 00:51:35,770
You need to learn to shit, eat

724
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,270
and breathe this kind of life.

725
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,547
No using your identifier, no
calling home, no calling in.

726
00:51:45,956 --> 00:51:46,789
- Home.

727
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:50,089
You got pulled in with your P-Card.

728
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:52,696
- I meant to get caught with the card.

729
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,116
Cops are supposed to bring you straight

730
00:51:54,116 --> 00:51:56,184
to Donovan if you have it.

731
00:51:56,184 --> 00:51:58,926
I had to use it, so I
didn't look suspicious.

732
00:51:58,926 --> 00:52:00,431
You wanted to get arrested?

733
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:01,733
- Yeah, it worked.

734
00:52:01,733 --> 00:52:02,566
I got to you.

735
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:04,852
You are fucked up.

736
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:06,853
- The only fucked up thing is the people

737
00:52:06,853 --> 00:52:11,020
who don't know about the
card are the cops themselves.

738
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:14,183
- I actually didn't know what it was

739
00:52:14,183 --> 00:52:16,965
until the captain yelled
at me the other day.

740
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:18,635
- You didn't know your field identifier?

741
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,165
- I thought it was a gym membership.

742
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:21,510
- A gym...

743
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,343
Did you try to use it?

744
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:25,958
- What do you think?

745
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:29,612
I haven't been to the gym in years.

746
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:31,168
So what now?

747
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:34,668
- Harry, Harry Fissolino, do you know him?

748
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:40,012
I've been workin' on gettin' in with him.

749
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:42,202
Told him the story, and as
long as you stick to it,

750
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,702
we should be okay.

751
00:52:47,424 --> 00:52:50,864
- He always send a boy
around to do his pickups.

752
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:51,697
- Tommy?

753
00:52:53,688 --> 00:52:55,628
We'd better hope they don't know you,

754
00:52:55,628 --> 00:52:57,414
'cause we're gonna go
meet Tommy in the morning.

755
00:52:57,414 --> 00:52:59,154
- Tomorrow?

756
00:52:59,154 --> 00:53:00,237
- When we do,

757
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:04,903
he's either gonna kill you, kill me

758
00:53:04,903 --> 00:53:07,778
or ask you to do something.

759
00:53:07,778 --> 00:53:09,016
- Something?

760
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:12,183
- Something you're not gonna like.

761
00:53:12,183 --> 00:53:13,191
What?

762
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,639
Somethin' not good.

763
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:17,285
Like kill somebody?

764
00:53:17,285 --> 00:53:20,125
No, beat up a whore,

765
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:22,373
some shit like that.

766
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:28,214
So my options
are die, die or fucked up.

767
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:47,915
I got you something.

768
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:59,134
- You wear it.

769
00:53:59,134 --> 00:54:00,019
- Come on.

770
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:01,912
- I look terrible.

771
00:54:01,912 --> 00:54:03,495
- I got it for you.

772
00:54:06,587 --> 00:54:08,041
- Okay.

773
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,787
But you wear it next time.

774
00:54:09,787 --> 00:54:10,620
- Okay.

775
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:21,512
Mm-mm.

776
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:29,386
- Thank you.

777
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:31,755
Come on.

778
00:54:31,755 --> 00:54:32,708
- Zeke.

779
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:34,342
- Yes?

780
00:54:34,342 --> 00:54:35,759
- After this one,

781
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:39,165
I promise this is the last.

782
00:54:39,165 --> 00:54:40,340
- Okay.

783
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,596
I know, baby.

784
00:54:41,596 --> 00:54:44,488
- Hey, don't call me that.

785
00:54:44,488 --> 00:54:47,655
- I don't like when you're doing this.

786
00:54:52,393 --> 00:54:53,810
I'll stay around.

787
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:03,031
Okay then.

788
00:55:04,618 --> 00:55:07,368
I'll come back, tomorrow morning.

789
00:55:19,206 --> 00:55:21,559
You're so good to me.

790
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:25,432
I try.

791
00:55:48,397 --> 00:55:52,263
- There's no elevator in this
piece of crap place of yours.

792
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:53,346
Crap stairs.

793
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:56,333
Where are you?

794
00:56:02,972 --> 00:56:04,120
Babe!

795
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:38,955
- Typical.

796
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,743
♫ Hope

797
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:51,076
♫ I've lost my way

798
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:57,433
♫ It's been so long

799
00:58:00,673 --> 00:58:04,256
♫ If you were there at all

800
00:58:07,726 --> 00:58:09,476
♫ Now

801
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:15,356
♫ Emptiness consumes

802
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:21,048
♫ My broken heart

803
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:26,489
♫ Finds solace there

804
00:58:31,336 --> 00:58:33,503
♫ Dull me

805
00:58:36,968 --> 00:58:40,452
♫ Take it all away

806
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:41,952
- It's a pink day.

807
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:49,806
♫ This pain that I'm feeling
Running through my veins

808
00:59:51,678 --> 00:59:54,261
- Where the hell have you been?

809
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:56,917
- Groceries.

810
01:00:02,347 --> 01:00:04,051
- Come over here.

811
01:00:04,051 --> 01:00:05,871
What for?

812
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:06,954
- You'll see.

813
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,690
- Come here.

814
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:16,663
I wanna smell you.

815
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:37,207
You got something to say?

816
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:41,352
- You have fun last night, Daddy?

817
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:42,449
- You gonna tell me?

818
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:43,282
- No.

819
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:47,507
- I can smell it on you.

820
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,578
- I don't know what you mean.

821
01:00:51,578 --> 01:00:52,820
- Tell me!

822
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,046
- What?

823
01:00:54,046 --> 01:00:56,296
- I smell sex all over you.

824
01:01:01,214 --> 01:01:03,131
You want me, don't you?

825
01:01:04,457 --> 01:01:06,572
No.

826
01:01:06,572 --> 01:01:08,292
- Yes, you do.

827
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:09,408
- No, Daddy.

828
01:01:09,408 --> 01:01:10,789
- Oh yes, you do.

829
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:14,956
You know , you
know you want.

830
01:01:16,394 --> 01:01:18,894
Oh hell, let's just go to the bed.

831
01:01:40,273 --> 01:01:42,523
- Oh Daddy, you're so good.

832
01:01:43,714 --> 01:01:47,881
You mmem.. , mem..phis. .

833
01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:50,393
- Oh yes.

834
01:02:02,924 --> 01:02:04,007
Are you done?

835
01:02:04,961 --> 01:02:07,063
I think so.

836
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:08,146
I don't know.

837
01:02:10,235 --> 01:02:12,282
Let's just call it a day.

838
01:02:12,282 --> 01:02:13,699
- You're so good.

839
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:32,462
What's the matter, baby?

840
01:02:35,297 --> 01:02:37,968
- The boss approved Malcolm.

841
01:02:37,968 --> 01:02:38,885
- Stealing?

842
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:41,382
- Yeah.

843
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:45,017
- Well, you had to, baby.

844
01:02:47,906 --> 01:02:49,823
- Zeke and Memory, too.

845
01:03:55,163 --> 01:03:56,246
- Hey, Tommy.

846
01:03:57,383 --> 01:03:59,863
Zeke here?

847
01:03:59,863 --> 01:04:02,378
Zeke?

848
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:19,296
Tommy?

849
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:22,946
I've been so fucked up.

850
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,032
But I want to get better.

851
01:04:31,861 --> 01:04:35,855
- Harry wanted me to give you something.

852
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:36,855
- Is that...

853
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:41,492
Tommy, did I do something wrong?

854
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:42,325
- No.

855
01:04:43,959 --> 01:04:46,542
No, he wants you to get better.

856
01:04:49,149 --> 01:04:50,732
This is gonna help.

857
01:04:51,837 --> 01:04:52,670
- Okay.

858
01:04:54,509 --> 01:04:56,426
Okay, I'm trying.

859
01:04:58,073 --> 01:04:59,593
I know.

860
01:04:59,593 --> 01:05:02,972
- I need to stop being such a bad girl.

861
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:04,972
- Not like that Memphis.

862
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:14,160
- Tommy, ever since...

863
01:05:17,259 --> 01:05:20,592
You've always been like a brother to me.

864
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,933
Thank you.

865
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:49,818
Sorry, Harry.

866
01:06:06,427 --> 01:06:07,260
- Tommy.

867
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:09,866
- God.

868
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,305
You used to be so strong.

869
01:06:21,814 --> 01:06:22,647
Memory?

870
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:27,110
What have you, what did you do?

871
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,260
my...

872
01:06:56,339 --> 01:06:58,406
- Try you something.

873
01:06:58,406 --> 01:07:00,878
Nobody knows who me is.

874
01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:01,711
Forever girl.

875
01:07:29,285 --> 01:07:31,844
- God, you put before me two paths,

876
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:33,427
the righteous path,

877
01:07:34,712 --> 01:07:36,295
the less righteous.

878
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:39,477
And if I tell the truth,

879
01:07:39,477 --> 01:07:42,310
it'll take me out of your service.

880
01:07:46,343 --> 01:07:49,532
I want to continue to
spread your word of peace

881
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,365
and spread your glory.

882
01:07:53,439 --> 01:07:55,272
I'm here for you, God.

883
01:07:56,737 --> 01:07:59,237
I'm here to spread your honor.

884
01:08:02,665 --> 01:08:06,165
But I only damn my self through the truth.

885
01:08:10,604 --> 01:08:12,307
I want to continue to save your souls.

886
01:08:12,307 --> 01:08:14,140
I want to continue to,

887
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:19,835
but I would drive more
people away from you.

888
01:08:19,835 --> 01:08:22,002
More people will hate you.

889
01:08:23,528 --> 01:08:25,278
I want to save souls.

890
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,386
But I must damn my own.

891
01:08:29,549 --> 01:08:30,716
I need a sign.

892
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,108
Dear God in Heaven, I need a sign.

893
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:07,601
Yo.

894
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:08,701
- Tommy.

895
01:09:08,701 --> 01:09:10,241
Yeah.

896
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:12,069
- We still on for this morning?

897
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:14,047
Uh, yeah.

898
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:14,880
Give me a half hour.

899
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,421
I got to take a shit.

900
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:18,687
- All right.

901
01:09:26,418 --> 01:09:27,585
Are you ready?

902
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:45,991
- What is...

903
01:09:48,756 --> 01:09:50,850
- My girlfriend.

904
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,683
Girlfriend?

905
01:09:56,176 --> 01:09:57,593
- She was killed.

906
01:09:58,689 --> 01:10:00,823
Killed?

907
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:02,158
- In a fire.

908
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:04,741
- Oh my child, oh I'm so sorry.

909
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,535
- What do I do?

910
01:10:08,775 --> 01:10:11,192
- The only thing to do, pray.

911
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,323
- I...

912
01:10:16,323 --> 01:10:17,654
How?

913
01:10:17,654 --> 01:10:21,487
- Oh my child, you don't
know the love of God.

914
01:10:24,643 --> 01:10:28,143
Please, dear Heavenly Father, watch over--

915
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,072
- Memphis, uh, Memory.

916
01:10:35,797 --> 01:10:38,880
- Watch over our, Memory, and please,

917
01:10:39,946 --> 01:10:42,079
dear Heavenly Father, forgive us our sins,

918
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:44,287
'cause we know they are many.

919
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:47,994
And watch over Memory and
keep her safe in our hearts

920
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,744
during this time of
great sadness and sorrow.

921
01:10:59,448 --> 01:11:00,698
- You saved me.

922
01:11:02,945 --> 01:11:03,778
- I saved?

923
01:11:07,855 --> 01:11:08,688
Shh.

924
01:11:20,994 --> 01:11:23,077
- Get your asses in here.

925
01:11:24,886 --> 01:11:26,386
Guns on the table.

926
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:32,749
Wallets, too.

927
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,342
Head on into the parlor.

928
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:44,357
Known him since I was 10.

929
01:11:44,357 --> 01:11:47,556
- Drop your pants, show me your junk.

930
01:11:47,556 --> 01:11:48,389
- What are you some--

931
01:11:48,389 --> 01:11:49,592
- Just do it!

932
01:11:49,592 --> 01:11:50,425
Peel now!

933
01:11:56,858 --> 01:11:58,946
It ain't even fucking cold in here.

934
01:11:58,946 --> 01:11:59,946
Get dressed.

935
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:04,267
Danny, we got a lot of
shit going on right now.

936
01:12:04,267 --> 01:12:05,329
Harry, you told me.

937
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:07,408
- What do you know about this guy?

938
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:09,446
- Known him since I was a kid.

939
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:10,684
We've done a few job together.

940
01:12:11,765 --> 01:12:12,598
Hit a bank once.

941
01:12:14,014 --> 01:12:16,089
- I don't have time for this shit.

942
01:12:18,629 --> 01:12:20,212
- This is not good.

943
01:12:21,141 --> 01:12:22,099
- What?

944
01:12:22,099 --> 01:12:22,932
Zeke.

945
01:12:22,932 --> 01:12:23,765
- I patted him down once.

946
01:12:23,765 --> 01:12:25,944
I think he knows me.

947
01:12:29,128 --> 01:12:29,961
- Sit down.

948
01:12:32,926 --> 01:12:34,519
What is it?

949
01:12:34,519 --> 01:12:37,040
- I talked to the priest.

950
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,908
- Look, Zeke, I got to tell you.

951
01:12:39,908 --> 01:12:42,844
It's--
- I can't do anything right.

952
01:12:42,844 --> 01:12:43,844
- I, I was--

953
01:12:44,924 --> 01:12:47,424
- The building, it burnt down.

954
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:50,560
- What do you mean?

955
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,727
What building?

956
01:12:53,254 --> 01:12:54,274
What do you mean--

957
01:12:54,274 --> 01:12:55,467
- She had to get out.

958
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:59,015
- What do you mean the
building burnt down?

959
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:02,473
- I was talking to Thornton, the homeless.

960
01:13:02,473 --> 01:13:04,056
- Yeah, I know him.

961
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,591
- I came back,

962
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:07,674
and the cops,

963
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:11,638
they said found her body burned up

964
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:16,085
in the stairwell.

965
01:13:16,918 --> 01:13:17,751
- Oh God.

966
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:19,703
I'm sorry.

967
01:13:25,704 --> 01:13:27,204
Wait here.

968
01:13:27,204 --> 01:13:28,168
- Tommy.

969
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:29,168
- Just stay.

970
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,313
- He's a cop.

971
01:13:43,221 --> 01:13:44,971
- Empty your pockets.

972
01:13:50,566 --> 01:13:51,901
What's this?

973
01:13:51,901 --> 01:13:52,747
- It's, um--

974
01:13:52,747 --> 01:13:53,768
- Where'd you get it?

975
01:13:53,768 --> 01:13:56,427
- Lockup, evidence locker.

976
01:13:56,427 --> 01:13:57,260
- Marked?

977
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:59,523
- No.
- Tommy--

978
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:02,856
- You brought a fuckin' cop to my house!

979
01:14:06,178 --> 01:14:08,095
You're Derrick Forrest.

980
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,549
Yeah.

981
01:14:10,549 --> 01:14:14,132
- What they did to your
wife and your kids,

982
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:16,856
we didn't do it.

983
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,490
- I don't care.

984
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,227
- What are you doing here?

985
01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:25,068
- I want in.

986
01:14:26,245 --> 01:14:28,316
Look, I know you run numbers.

987
01:14:28,316 --> 01:14:30,720
You run my numbers.

988
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,235
I also know some of your
guys are getting involved

989
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:33,735
in the drug trade.

990
01:14:35,006 --> 01:14:36,035
- Drug trade?

991
01:14:36,035 --> 01:14:39,589
- I could increase your turnout 300%.

992
01:14:39,589 --> 01:14:42,482
- And how are you gonna do that?

993
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:43,999
- Hell, if I know.

994
01:14:43,999 --> 01:14:47,396
I really thought you were
gonna kill me by now.

995
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:49,229
Listen, I know things.

996
01:14:51,261 --> 01:14:52,340
I know where the force is,

997
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,808
and I know how to get around them.

998
01:14:54,808 --> 01:14:56,739
I know who's dirty.

999
01:14:56,739 --> 01:14:58,994
And I know who wants to get dirty.

1000
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,925
And I know who's clean.

1001
01:15:00,925 --> 01:15:04,175
- You said some of my guys are dealin'.

1002
01:15:06,442 --> 01:15:07,275
Who?

1003
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,252
- The new kid.

1004
01:15:11,252 --> 01:15:13,279
Danny?

1005
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,639
- No, the one who wears
black all the time.

1006
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:19,618
Zeke

1007
01:15:19,618 --> 01:15:21,118
- Fucking Malcolm.

1008
01:15:24,692 --> 01:15:25,525
What now?

1009
01:15:27,788 --> 01:15:31,853
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, mother fuck!

1010
01:15:31,853 --> 01:15:32,996
Sit down.

1011
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:35,969
You bring a fucking cop to my house.

1012
01:15:35,969 --> 01:15:36,802
- I don't know, Tommy.

1013
01:15:36,802 --> 01:15:38,102
- No, no, you don't know.

1014
01:15:38,102 --> 01:15:39,435
You don't, fuck!

1015
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:45,004
Fine.

1016
01:15:45,004 --> 01:15:48,561
You go kill Malcolm,
bring me proof he's dead.

1017
01:15:48,561 --> 01:15:49,394
- What?

1018
01:15:50,506 --> 01:15:52,532
- Your first instinct was right.

1019
01:15:55,678 --> 01:15:57,326
- There's a problem.

1020
01:15:57,326 --> 01:16:00,638
- Oh no, there isn't a
problem, is there Forrest?

1021
01:16:00,638 --> 01:16:01,471
- No.

1022
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:04,369
No, there's a problem.

1023
01:16:04,369 --> 01:16:06,501
- No, there's no problem.

1024
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:10,042
There's no fucking problem, Shh.. Danny G.

1025
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:11,718
- They took his gun.

1026
01:16:11,718 --> 01:16:12,940
Derrick they took your gun.

1027
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:15,868
- That really doesn't
concern me right now.

1028
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:18,451
Tommy, I will do what you want.

1029
01:16:20,269 --> 01:16:21,936
I will kill Malcolm.

1030
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,590
- Get the fuck out of here.

1031
01:16:35,712 --> 01:16:38,828
- You know, you're screwed
if he uses your gun.

1032
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:41,324
That was your police issue, right?

1033
01:16:41,324 --> 01:16:42,765
- Relax.

1034
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,828
I'll phone it in.

1035
01:16:44,828 --> 01:16:45,828
I'm kidding.

1036
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:50,327
Who the hell is Malcolm?

1037
01:16:50,327 --> 01:16:53,077
- Malcolm, Malcolm's the new guy.

1038
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:56,314
What are the odds?

1039
01:16:56,314 --> 01:16:57,455
- You got to be kidding me.

1040
01:16:57,455 --> 01:16:58,955
You were bluffing?

1041
01:17:01,102 --> 01:17:04,208
How'd you know he wore black?

1042
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:07,808
- All the new guys try to impress.

1043
01:17:07,808 --> 01:17:08,975
You, too, kid.

1044
01:17:11,074 --> 01:17:12,741
- Don't call me kid.

1045
01:17:23,687 --> 01:17:25,700
Great, how am
I supposed to kill Malcolm.

1046
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,069
I don't even have a gun.

1047
01:17:27,069 --> 01:17:31,236
Here, take my gun,
just don't leave it behind.

1048
01:17:31,594 --> 01:17:34,981
If they find it, they'll think I did it.

1049
01:17:43,266 --> 01:17:45,266
- You shouldn't be here.

1050
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,443
Oh God.

1051
01:17:56,926 --> 01:17:58,759
Do you think it's her?

1052
01:18:02,685 --> 01:18:03,518
Her face?

1053
01:18:10,425 --> 01:18:11,508
I'm so sorry.

1054
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:00,906
- It ain't nobler.

1055
01:19:05,748 --> 01:19:07,331
Get me out of this.

1056
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:17,463
- That's fine.

1057
01:19:17,463 --> 01:19:19,118
You do what you got to do.

1058
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:19,951
- Please.

1059
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:30,963
- You put it in the
place by nine, or don't,

1060
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:35,452
your call.

1061
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,045
- It's you.

1062
01:20:03,388 --> 01:20:05,011
- What did he want?

1063
01:20:08,988 --> 01:20:11,071
I'm supposed to kill him.

1064
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,617
- You want to kill him?

1065
01:20:16,109 --> 01:20:16,942
- No.

1066
01:20:19,532 --> 01:20:21,199
But I'm supposed to.

1067
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:28,445
It's not a joke.

1068
01:20:28,445 --> 01:20:29,278
- I know.

1069
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:37,786
- So what am I supposed to do?

1070
01:20:37,786 --> 01:20:41,869
- You're askin' me, and
I'm supposed to tell you.

1071
01:20:46,503 --> 01:20:50,670
Sometimes we don't do
what we're supposed to do,

1072
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:52,880
even though we should.

1073
01:21:25,662 --> 01:21:26,495
- Zeke,

1074
01:21:27,986 --> 01:21:29,486
you need to leave.

1075
01:21:30,903 --> 01:21:33,070
Go, go far away from here.

1076
01:21:35,255 --> 01:21:36,625
- I can't.

1077
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,708
- Do you want to be dead?

1078
01:21:40,475 --> 01:21:41,392
- Go, I go.

1079
01:21:43,255 --> 01:21:44,422
For what, why?

1080
01:21:45,938 --> 01:21:47,663
- To stay alive.

1081
01:21:47,663 --> 01:21:49,080
- What do I care?

1082
01:21:50,826 --> 01:21:51,659
- I care.

1083
01:21:54,506 --> 01:21:57,364
- I don't know what to think anymore.

1084
01:21:57,364 --> 01:21:59,971
I don't know what to do.

1085
01:21:59,971 --> 01:22:01,888
I need to do it for me.

1086
01:22:03,072 --> 01:22:05,261
I don't want to do anything for you.

1087
01:22:05,261 --> 01:22:09,428
I don't want to do anything for
Harry or Memphis or anybody.

1088
01:22:10,436 --> 01:22:12,539
If I am leaving, I'm for me.

1089
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:13,372
Fuck you!

1090
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:27,238
- You know, I really--

1091
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:28,449
- Fuck you, Tommy!

1092
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:30,116
- You think this would hurt me?

1093
01:22:30,116 --> 01:22:31,622
I'd rather you put a
bullet through my head

1094
01:22:31,622 --> 01:22:34,105
than say what you just said to me.

1095
01:22:34,105 --> 01:22:37,605
♫ Raise a hair on my neck

1096
01:22:38,442 --> 01:22:42,359
♫ Into the lips we share, yeah

1097
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,260
- You have the nicest tits.

1098
01:22:49,409 --> 01:22:51,241
- You should be looking at the numbers.

1099
01:22:51,241 --> 01:22:55,408
- I know, but I'm distracted
by those massive bongos.

1100
01:22:55,913 --> 01:22:58,574
There are none that even come close.

1101
01:22:58,574 --> 01:22:59,407
- Well, you should know.

1102
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,574
You've sampled everyone's.

1103
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:04,338
- Don't be like that.

1104
01:23:04,338 --> 01:23:05,995
You're the best.

1105
01:23:05,995 --> 01:23:08,245
At least now I am.

1106
01:23:09,591 --> 01:23:11,693
- Don't do that.

1107
01:23:11,693 --> 01:23:12,526
- Sorry.

1108
01:23:14,627 --> 01:23:15,704
Sorry.

1109
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:17,204
- You know better.

1110
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:21,031
- Here are your numbers.

1111
01:23:21,031 --> 01:23:22,685
You're gonna be significantly short.

1112
01:23:22,685 --> 01:23:25,095
Malcolm cut you for 34 six,

1113
01:23:25,095 --> 01:23:29,262
and you're not gonna be getting
money from ... some others.

1114
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:31,158
I'm sorry about--

1115
01:23:31,158 --> 01:23:32,491
- Don't do that.

1116
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:38,751
Forget that.

1117
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:43,168
Malcolm shouldn't be
a problem after today.

1118
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:14,380
You're all set.

1119
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,213
- What the fly?

1120
01:25:15,213 --> 01:25:18,546
At least he didn't call me kid.

1121
01:25:20,523 --> 01:25:21,550
- You?

1122
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:22,383
- No.

1123
01:25:23,923 --> 01:25:24,756
You.

1124
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,354
- What did you do?

1125
01:25:29,354 --> 01:25:30,959
You killed him?

1126
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:31,792
No.

1127
01:25:33,515 --> 01:25:35,612
- There is no line.

1128
01:25:35,612 --> 01:25:38,233
You have to get that through your head.

1129
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:42,400
- You want me to trust you,
and then you do this, why?

1130
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:46,204
- You weren't gonna do it.

1131
01:25:46,204 --> 01:25:47,954
- No, I'm not insane.

1132
01:25:50,115 --> 01:25:50,948
My gun?

1133
01:25:52,236 --> 01:25:55,510
So now you've got this over my head.

1134
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:58,093
- I will kill you if I have to.

1135
01:25:59,374 --> 01:26:01,136
This is my operation.

1136
01:26:01,136 --> 01:26:02,680
- Your operation?

1137
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,275
This is supposed to be a police operation.

1138
01:26:05,275 --> 01:26:07,431
- This is my operation.

1139
01:26:07,431 --> 01:26:10,100
If you mess up, I get done,

1140
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,141
not the cops, me.

1141
01:26:12,141 --> 01:26:14,558
- You're one of the bad guys.

1142
01:26:15,475 --> 01:26:18,949
- I'm trying to get to the
middle of the hornets nest.

1143
01:26:18,949 --> 01:26:20,555
The only way I know how to do it is

1144
01:26:20,555 --> 01:26:22,722
to become a hornet myself.

1145
01:26:25,154 --> 01:26:28,128
- It's scum like you I
tried to get off the street.

1146
01:26:28,128 --> 01:26:30,116
- I'm trying to get the hornets' leader.

1147
01:26:30,116 --> 01:26:31,623
I'm trying to get the queen.

1148
01:26:31,623 --> 01:26:34,416
I get the queen, I get the entire nest.

1149
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:37,147
If not, I get a bunch of
little pissed off wasps.

1150
01:26:37,147 --> 01:26:38,229
- It's not wasp.

1151
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:39,062
It's bees.

1152
01:26:39,062 --> 01:26:41,517
Wasps don't have a queen.

1153
01:26:41,517 --> 01:26:43,141
- You know what I mean, forget the wasps.

1154
01:26:43,141 --> 01:26:44,756
- You want me to start killing people

1155
01:26:44,756 --> 01:26:45,908
to get into the middle of this.

1156
01:26:45,908 --> 01:26:46,741
- Maybe.

1157
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:48,388
You're already here.

1158
01:26:48,388 --> 01:26:50,483
- Yeah, no thanks to you.

1159
01:26:50,483 --> 01:26:51,998
- So what?

1160
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:53,871
Now let's go tell Tommy what you did,

1161
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:56,371
so he knows you can trust him.

1162
01:26:58,884 --> 01:27:00,801
- You are fucking nuts.

1163
01:27:03,581 --> 01:27:04,728
It's not funny.

1164
01:27:04,728 --> 01:27:05,901
- Yeah, it is.

1165
01:27:05,901 --> 01:27:08,908
Now let's go get the queen.

1166
01:27:08,908 --> 01:27:10,481
- The queen?

1167
01:27:10,481 --> 01:27:12,322
- The queen wasp.

1168
01:27:12,322 --> 01:27:14,239
- It's bees, you idiot.

1169
01:27:15,604 --> 01:27:16,521
- Whatever.

1170
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:19,062
Now where's my gun?

1171
01:27:27,412 --> 01:27:28,865
Where's Saul?

1172
01:27:28,865 --> 01:27:30,782
- He's not at the door?

1173
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,503
I don't know.

1174
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:39,829
- Where's Saul?

1175
01:27:40,899 --> 01:27:41,732
- Saul?

1176
01:27:43,486 --> 01:27:45,023
I sent him to check on you.

1177
01:27:45,856 --> 01:27:47,731
- Check on me?

1178
01:27:47,731 --> 01:27:50,243
- Just to see if everything's all right.

1179
01:27:50,243 --> 01:27:51,993
- You don't trust me?

1180
01:27:53,847 --> 01:27:55,347
- What's going on?

1181
01:27:56,808 --> 01:27:58,225
- Malcolm's dead.

1182
01:27:59,101 --> 01:28:01,454
Danny's guy took care of it.

1183
01:28:01,454 --> 01:28:03,923
He used his police gun.

1184
01:28:03,923 --> 01:28:05,649
- Police gun?

1185
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:08,099
- Yeah, he used to be a cop.

1186
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:09,969
I think it's gonna be all right.

1187
01:28:09,969 --> 01:28:12,802
Dirty.

1188
01:28:14,029 --> 01:28:15,112
I saw Memory.

1189
01:28:17,648 --> 01:28:18,481
- I heard.

1190
01:28:20,789 --> 01:28:22,986
- It had to be done.

1191
01:28:22,986 --> 01:28:24,653
You did good, Tommy.

1192
01:28:27,812 --> 01:28:30,127
- I know, it was--

1193
01:28:30,127 --> 01:28:32,547
- That piece of crap, Zeke.

1194
01:28:32,547 --> 01:28:34,699
Don't.

1195
01:28:34,699 --> 01:28:35,782
- Don't what?

1196
01:28:37,259 --> 01:28:38,092
- She's,

1197
01:28:40,947 --> 01:28:42,197
she's not dead.

1198
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:45,994
- The sooner, the better.

1199
01:28:47,927 --> 01:28:49,094
- Look, Harry,

1200
01:28:50,305 --> 01:28:51,638
Memphis is dead.

1201
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:56,827
The only reason why you wanted
Zeke dead was because of her.

1202
01:28:57,301 --> 01:28:58,698
- Wait a minute!

1203
01:28:58,698 --> 01:29:00,069
You telling me to think about it.

1204
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:01,979
Who the fuck are you?

1205
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:04,056
I need you to get Zeke done.

1206
01:29:04,056 --> 01:29:05,749
She's the reason Memory is dead.

1207
01:29:05,749 --> 01:29:07,245
You need to do it!

1208
01:29:07,245 --> 01:29:10,385
- Harry, I need you to reconsider this.

1209
01:29:10,385 --> 01:29:12,468
- What is wrong with you?

1210
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:14,823
What's in your brain?

1211
01:29:14,823 --> 01:29:17,947
- She didn't do anything wrong.

1212
01:29:17,947 --> 01:29:19,114
She goes free.

1213
01:29:23,177 --> 01:29:26,427
Harry, you've been like a father to me.

1214
01:29:31,964 --> 01:29:33,881
The son has to grow up.

1215
01:29:37,344 --> 01:29:38,594
- Oh, I'm done?

1216
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:43,962
Give me a break.

1217
01:29:46,007 --> 01:29:48,590
Tommy, Tommy, put the gun down.

1218
01:29:49,987 --> 01:29:52,398
Tommy, Tommy, put that gun down.

1219
01:29:52,398 --> 01:29:53,674
Tommy, you can't--

1220
01:29:53,674 --> 01:29:55,397
- The hell I can't!

1221
01:30:01,908 --> 01:30:02,951
- Memory?

1222
01:30:02,951 --> 01:30:04,701
- My name is Memphis.

1223
01:30:07,565 --> 01:30:10,482
You, you're, you're dead.

1224
01:30:11,428 --> 01:30:15,144
- Dead means you can't hurt anymore.

1225
01:30:15,144 --> 01:30:17,431
- I didn't know what to do.

1226
01:30:17,431 --> 01:30:18,823
I was confused.

1227
01:30:18,823 --> 01:30:20,330
You were on drugs.

1228
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:21,971
I had to do it.

1229
01:30:21,971 --> 01:30:23,388
I didn't do this.

1230
01:30:25,015 --> 01:30:26,909
Daddy, help me.

1231
01:30:26,909 --> 01:30:28,109
Help me get clean.

1232
01:30:28,109 --> 01:30:29,769
- I can help you.

1233
01:30:29,769 --> 01:30:32,055
- I need money, just enough to get by.

1234
01:30:32,055 --> 01:30:34,157
- No, no, I can help you my way.

1235
01:30:34,157 --> 01:30:35,444
- No, my way.

1236
01:30:35,444 --> 01:30:36,869
I need money,

1237
01:30:36,869 --> 01:30:38,326
just enough to get me by.
- I can't give you money.

1238
01:30:38,326 --> 01:30:40,573
I can't give you any money.
- Yes, yes, you can.

1239
01:30:40,573 --> 01:30:41,690
- No, I can't have any more money

1240
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:42,987
going to drugs.
- Yes, you can.

1241
01:30:42,987 --> 01:30:45,070
- No, no drugs, no money.

1242
01:30:45,934 --> 01:30:46,826
- No.
- Memory.

1243
01:30:46,826 --> 01:30:47,975
Memphis.
- We do this my way.

1244
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:50,649
- Memphis, you know I
know how to help you.

1245
01:30:50,649 --> 01:30:53,117
I can't be giving you
any more money for drugs.

1246
01:30:53,117 --> 01:30:53,950
It's over!

1247
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,934
- You sent Tommy to kill me.

1248
01:30:57,934 --> 01:30:58,767
I--

1249
01:30:58,767 --> 01:31:00,998
But you killed me long before that.

1250
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:03,410
- I, I, I didn't know.

1251
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:06,956
How could I know?
- How could you?

1252
01:31:06,956 --> 01:31:09,422
Daddy, I need the money.

1253
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:11,997
- I can't give you any more money.

1254
01:31:11,997 --> 01:31:15,164
- I need the money, I need the money.

1255
01:31:15,164 --> 01:31:16,077
- We got to do it my way.

1256
01:31:16,077 --> 01:31:16,910
- I need--

1257
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:17,876
- We have to do it my way.

1258
01:31:17,876 --> 01:31:19,356
We have to do it my way.

1259
01:31:19,356 --> 01:31:20,556
The money's no good.

1260
01:31:20,556 --> 01:31:22,890
The money's no good
without doing it right.

1261
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:25,370
You know I know what you need.

1262
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:26,929
I've done it before.

1263
01:31:26,929 --> 01:31:28,571
I will take care of you, baby.

1264
01:31:28,571 --> 01:31:30,694
I will take care of you.

1265
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:32,238
We'll get it done.

1266
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:33,771
We'll get it done.

1267
01:31:33,771 --> 01:31:35,252
Baby,

1268
01:31:35,252 --> 01:31:36,669
baby, I love you.

1269
01:31:38,419 --> 01:31:39,336
I love you.

1270
01:31:40,986 --> 01:31:43,069
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1271
01:32:15,102 --> 01:32:16,218
Daddy?

1272
01:32:16,218 --> 01:32:18,065
What have I done?

1273
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:19,344
- It's over.

1274
01:32:19,344 --> 01:32:20,436
It's fixed.

1275
01:32:20,436 --> 01:32:24,603
Nothing's fixed.

1276
01:32:27,355 --> 01:32:30,355
It's easy to hide the dead.

1277
01:32:37,123 --> 01:32:38,653
- What happened?

1278
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:40,033
- Harry and Tommy.

1279
01:32:40,033 --> 01:32:40,866
- You?

1280
01:32:40,866 --> 01:32:44,132
- No, no, no, come on, come on, come on.

1281
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:53,233
- Dear God.

1282
01:32:54,163 --> 01:32:55,109
- I know.

1283
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:56,032
- What'd you do?

1284
01:32:56,032 --> 01:32:57,636
- It wasn't me, goddammit.

1285
01:32:57,636 --> 01:32:58,767
- What do we do, Danny?

1286
01:32:58,767 --> 01:33:00,384
- What, what do we do?

1287
01:33:00,384 --> 01:33:01,864
- You're in charge.

1288
01:33:01,864 --> 01:33:04,090
- Look, what are you talkin' about?

1289
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:07,001
- You think Saul's gonna
take over for Harry?

1290
01:33:07,001 --> 01:33:09,480
You have to take control of this.

1291
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,033
- I'm in charge?

1292
01:33:11,033 --> 01:33:11,866
- That's great.

1293
01:33:11,866 --> 01:33:14,949
- I need you to take control of this.

1294
01:33:16,124 --> 01:33:18,444
- Gina, this, it's not the way this is,

1295
01:33:18,444 --> 01:33:19,665
Tommy, are they dead?

1296
01:33:19,665 --> 01:33:20,793
- It is what it is.

1297
01:33:20,793 --> 01:33:23,439
Right now, you're in shock,

1298
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:26,302
but you have to just call the boss

1299
01:33:26,302 --> 01:33:28,276
and have them send the cleaners.

1300
01:33:28,276 --> 01:33:29,985
Think about it.

1301
01:33:29,985 --> 01:33:33,068
- Gina, I have to tell you something.

1302
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:35,622
I'm a--

1303
01:33:35,622 --> 01:33:36,935
Fuck!

1304
01:33:36,935 --> 01:33:37,768
Oh!

1305
01:33:37,768 --> 01:33:38,601
Tommy!

1306
01:33:38,601 --> 01:33:40,189
Oh this hurts.

1307
01:33:40,189 --> 01:33:41,925
- I can't tell who's dead anymore.

1308
01:33:45,646 --> 01:33:47,092
- Who did this?

1309
01:33:47,092 --> 01:33:49,005
- Rizzo's crew.

1310
01:33:49,005 --> 01:33:50,255
Shit.

1311
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:52,333
Is he dead?

1312
01:33:53,293 --> 01:33:54,732
- Yeah.

1313
01:33:57,303 --> 01:33:58,720
- You call it in?

1314
01:34:01,976 --> 01:34:03,143
Call 'em back.

1315
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:06,589
Tell 'em I'm in charge.

1316
01:34:08,433 --> 01:34:10,683
I'm gonna need permissions.

1317
01:34:56,146 --> 01:34:57,729
- I didn't do this.

1318
01:35:06,537 --> 01:35:08,158
- Memphis is dead.

1319
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:10,575
She's, she's not coming back.

1320
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:16,073
- It's not about you or her.

1321
01:35:21,794 --> 01:35:25,794
- I'm really not sure I
can do this without you.

1322
01:35:31,929 --> 01:35:33,179
- Yes, you can.

1323
01:35:34,273 --> 01:35:38,273
It's what you were meant
to do, what you wanted.

1324
01:35:47,364 --> 01:35:49,697
I'll always love you, Tommy.

1325
01:36:02,633 --> 01:36:04,633
- You go be happy, Zeke.

1326
01:36:29,592 --> 01:36:31,266
- He is amazing.

1327
01:36:31,266 --> 01:36:32,099
- Oh.

1328
01:36:32,099 --> 01:36:35,219
He is amazing.

1329
01:36:35,219 --> 01:36:37,552
- Sasha.
- He has your smile.

1330
01:36:39,484 --> 01:36:40,734
And your heart.

1331
01:36:41,613 --> 01:36:43,555
- I love you, Sasha.

1332
01:37:23,225 --> 01:37:25,142
- I gave up everything.

1333
01:37:26,732 --> 01:37:27,838
I'm trying to get back in this thing.

1334
01:37:27,838 --> 01:37:32,005
I thought I was gonna do
it without you, but now,

1335
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:34,695
now I know you're with me.

1336
01:37:34,695 --> 01:37:35,862
Watch over me.

1337
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:43,071
Freeze!

1338
01:37:49,287 --> 01:37:53,454
♫ Caravans are stuck where
it shows your single course

1339
01:37:54,312 --> 01:37:56,279
♫ Yeah, take your frustrations along

1340
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:05,043
♫ And then you flex our excitations

1341
01:38:46,037 --> 01:38:49,260
♫ We all gather clockwise

1342
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,734
♫ Stop to turn to time

1343
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:05,508
♫ We expected something much more

1344
01:39:06,782 --> 01:39:08,897
♫ Yesterday

1345
01:39:08,897 --> 01:39:12,397
♫ I can't see you stop it

1346
01:39:46,134 --> 01:39:49,281
♫ Over, under

1347
01:39:49,281 --> 01:39:52,225
♫ They got you now

1348
01:39:52,225 --> 01:39:55,543
♫ Over, under

1349
01:39:55,543 --> 01:39:58,530
♫ They got us now

1350
01:39:58,530 --> 01:40:00,820
♫ Over, under

1351
01:40:05,012 --> 01:40:08,284
♫ Over, under

1352
01:40:08,284 --> 01:40:11,117
♫ They got us now

1353
01:40:12,338 --> 01:40:15,005
You think it's over?

1354
01:40:19,377 --> 01:40:20,710
- Now it's over.
