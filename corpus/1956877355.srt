27
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:11,479
Let's remember what aristotle

28
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,654
said.

29
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:14,743
The aim of art is to represent

30
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,832
not the outward appearance

31
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,095
of things but their inward

32
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,097
significance.

33
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,794
All right, does anybody have

34
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:27,016
any questions?

35
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,931
Dylan.

36
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,194
Where do babies come from?

37
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:32,195
What?

38
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:35,677
Well... I...

39
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,983
uh, right.

40
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,159
You know what?

41
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,247
If there aren't any questions

42
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,857
about art specifically,

43
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:44,599
then I think that's it

44
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:45,774
for today.

45
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:46,644
Yes, dylan, do you have to go

46
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:47,645
to the bathroom?

47
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:48,864
No, I want to know

48
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,126
where babies come from.

49
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,040
I know.

50
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,215
I heard you.

51
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,130
But we're almost out of time.

52
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,653
So maybe we'll tackle that

53
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,872
subject next week.

54
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,699
But we still have

55
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:58,874
two minutes.

56
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,832
Thank you for that, lucy.

57
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,964
But please raise your hand

58
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,139
if you want to contribute to

59
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,793
the class.

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,447
We still have two minutes.

61
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,144
Okay, dylan, um...

62
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,319
I think it's best if you ask

63
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:12,192
your mom and dad about that.

64
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,976
I'll tell you later, dylan.

65
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:14,803
I know.

66
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,457
Wait, no, no.

67
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:17,806
I don't think that's a good idea

68
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:18,763
either.

69
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,677
Well, where do babies

70
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:20,852
come from?

71
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:21,984
You'll never believe it when

72
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:22,854
I tell you.

73
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,160
It's weird.

74
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:25,988
Whoa, whoa, it's not weird.

75
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,163
It's not weird.

76
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,730
It's, uh... it's natural.

77
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,819
Please don't listen to reggie

78
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:31,907
about this.

79
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,169
Who should we listen to?

80
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,214
Me, you should listen to me.

81
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,302
I'm an adult.

82
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,433
I know about these things.

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,478
Where do babies come from?

84
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:38,435
I'll draw it for you.

85
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:39,741
No, reggie, reg...

86
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,743
Okay, dylan, you have a man

87
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,744
and a woman, and...

88
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,180
what if it's two men

89
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,137
or two women?

90
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,748
Thank you again, lucy.

91
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:49,054
But please, raise your hand.

92
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,665
Okay, so you have a man and

93
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:51,709
a woman...

94
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:52,710
here, it's like this.

95
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:53,494
No, no, no, no, no.

96
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:56,236
No, sorry.

97
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:57,498
It's like this.

98
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,021
Please sit down, reggie.

99
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,152
There's a man and a woman

100
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,243
who are husband and wife...

101
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,027
your mother and your father,

102
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,202
okay?

103
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,944
And they have a special bond.

104
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,207
They...

105
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,253
they hug deeply.

106
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,732
And then, nine months later...

107
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,387
they hug for nine months?

108
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,084
No, they're lucky if they

109
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,085
hug for nine minutes.

110
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,870
But the point is,

111
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:23,219
because of this bond,

112
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,222
much, much later,

113
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,963
a baby arrives.

114
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,965
From a stork?

115
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,358
Yes.

116
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,751
Yes, dylan, from a stork.

117
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,231
Is a stork another name

118
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,277
for a vagina?

119
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:12,007
I think babies come from...

120
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:14,575
um...

121
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:17,099
hmm...

122
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,927
I don't know that.

123
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:22,278
From...

124
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,106
I think that babies come from

125
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,281
the sky.

126
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,588
From a truck.

127
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,329
I think babies come from

128
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,808
their mother or father's

129
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:31,635
stomach.

130
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:32,984
A truck?

131
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,030
That's... that's the silliest

132
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,032
thing I ever heard.

133
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,426
I don't know, but one time,

134
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,949
I saw on the computer

135
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:43,995
a panda having a baby.

136
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,215
And it just, like, shoots out

137
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:47,303
like... buucch!

138
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,392
Around 5 feet.

139
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,785
And I think that's how

140
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,526
babies come from.

141
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:54,789
Yeah, a truck!

142
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,225
I think babies come from

143
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,531
a baby store.

144
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,359
If they want to buy the baby,

145
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,360
then they need to just

146
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,623
pick them up.

147
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,799
But... but do we have some...

148
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:05,626
But do we...

149
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:27,343
Did you know that we're out

150
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,170
of soap?

151
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,345
Yeah.

152
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,825
Yeah?

153
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,217
You knew and you didn't say

154
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:33,654
anything or god forbid, maybe

155
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,698
replace the soap?

156
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:35,656
I did replace it.

157
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:36,483
No, you didn't.

158
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,440
Yeah, I did.

159
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:38,615
Hey, I was just in the

160
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:39,660
shower, and there was no soap.

161
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:40,878
Oh, well, that's 'cause

162
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:43,098
I hid it under the loofah.

163
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,099
Mm-hmm.

164
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,230
You... you hide soap?

165
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,406
Mm-hmm.

166
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,145
You hide soap from me, why?

167
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,277
Payback.

168
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:49,191
Besides the fact that you never

169
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:50,018
replace the soap,

170
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,236
you never replace

171
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:53,413
the toilet paper.

172
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,849
Well, I never finish...

173
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:55,980
leaving one square

174
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,242
on the roll is finishing it.

175
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,418
No, no, you know what?

176
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,419
By definition, "finishing it"

177
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,420
is finishing it.

178
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,203
And if I finished it,

179
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,334
I'd replace it.

180
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,466
The only reason you never

181
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:04,598
finish it is because you use

182
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:05,773
kleenex instead of toilet paper

183
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,513
when it's down to one square.

184
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,470
How'd you know that?

185
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,428
Because I tested you.

186
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,559
The last time there was

187
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,517
one square left on the roll,

188
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:11,605
it lasted six days.

189
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,867
So that means you either wiped

190
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:13,911
your butt with kleenex

191
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:14,738
or you need more fiber

192
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:15,696
in your diet.

193
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:16,871
So what did you do for

194
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,394
six days with no toilet paper?

195
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:21,223
I hid it behind the plunger.

196
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,311
I love you.

197
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:23,443
You should.

198
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,531
Without me, you'd be walking

199
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:25,532
around with dingleberries

200
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:26,794
between your legs.

201
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:28,709
You're disgusting.

202
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:29,840
Well, you're lazy.

203
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,059
Well, thank god I'm lazy,

204
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:32,060
because lazy people are the

205
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:32,887
most important people

206
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:33,627
in the world.

207
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:34,802
Oh, yeah?

208
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,412
Yeah, yeah, laziness breeds

209
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,631
efficiency.

210
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,241
It's because of the lazy people

211
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,243
that we have remote control,

212
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,158
automatic transmission, go-gurt.

213
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,115
Go-gurt?

214
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:44,899
It's all the handiwork

215
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:47,336
of the lazies.

216
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:50,078
Hey.

217
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,253
I love you.

218
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,256
Yeah.

219
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,737
Yeah?

220
00:07:56,824 --> 00:08:00,262
I love you too maybe?

221
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,306
Every once in a while would be

222
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,395
nice to hear.

223
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,055
I should go.

224
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:11,839
Why, you don't want to

225
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:12,579
spend the night?

226
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,102
No, I want to,

227
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,799
but I don't trust you

228
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,367
to keep your hands to yourself.

229
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:19,934
I swear I won't touch you.

230
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,283
Yeah, last time

231
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,937
you said that, I got about

232
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,547
15 minutes of sleep.

233
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:25,809
Well, stay the night and

234
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,681
I can promise you at least 30.

235
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:33,121
No, oh, tiff, please.

236
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,209
I can't. I can't.

237
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:35,297
I got deadlines; I can't.

238
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:36,994
Oh, yuck, deadlines.

239
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:38,387
You sound like my ex.

240
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,171
I had a great time tonight.

241
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:41,521
Me too.

242
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,131
But I wish you wouldn't pay

243
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:43,958
for dinner.

244
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:44,785
I didn't.

245
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:45,873
Ned did.

246
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,178
That's the joy of alimony.

247
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,353
Still, if we want this to

248
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,485
work out, you're gonna have to

249
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,791
start treating me like an adult.

250
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:51,705
I agree.

251
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,402
I understand 100%.

252
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,317
You need help with your laces?

253
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,580
Ha-ha-ha.

254
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:58,973
So when does jenna get back from

255
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,627
spring break?

256
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:01,584
Did you just say that

257
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,151
to make me feel old?

258
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:04,500
No, no, I just want to know

259
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,719
how much longer I have you

260
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:06,981
to myself before your teenage

261
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,330
daughter comes home.

262
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,811
Mm-hmm.

263
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:11,942
I will sneak you in

264
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:12,813
through the bedroom window.

265
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,640
Oh, my god.

266
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,912
Mm-mm, no, no.

267
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,000
No, I got to...

268
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:26,957
I know what you're doing.

269
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:27,871
It's not gonna work.

270
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,046
What am I doing?

271
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:29,830
You're trying to seduce me,

272
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:30,700
mrs. Milton.

273
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,833
Oh, that's a cheap shot.

274
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,095
Run along, little boy.

275
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,010
Go home.

276
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,185
See you in a couple of days?

277
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,929
Will?

278
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,104
Could you do me a quick favor

279
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,366
before you go?

280
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,020
There's a box in the study.

281
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,151
Could you just close it up

282
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:47,935
and put it on the top shelf

283
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,110
of the closet?

284
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:50,633
Yeah, sure.

285
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,069
Thanks.

286
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:57,379
And don't look inside.

287
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:00,556
I love this neighborhood.

288
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:02,558
When did you move in?

289
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,038
Um, I don't know,

290
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,867
about a month ago.

291
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,092
I like what you've done

292
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,441
with the place.

293
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,226
Thanks.

294
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:21,577
I'm still unpacking obviously.

295
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,405
Can I, um, offer you something

296
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:24,362
to drink?

297
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,363
And please say beer.

298
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,148
If you don't say beer,

299
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,671
I can only offer you

300
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:29,977
some rubbing alcohol

301
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:30,804
in the bathroom.

302
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,067
I would love a beer.

303
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,330
Great.

304
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,901
So, um, I got to tell you,

305
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,076
I didn't know what to expect.

306
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:44,687
You know, most of my blind dates

307
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,429
end disastrously.

308
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,692
Well, we still have time.

309
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,758
So what did wendy tell you

310
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:12,846
about me?

311
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,369
Uh, that you had a great

312
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:15,500
personality.

313
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:16,632
Ugh, and you still wanted

314
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,851
to go out with me?

315
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,723
And that you were easy.

316
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,640
I am not easy.

317
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm just... i'm highly amenable.

318
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:45,748
Whatever you do, don't kiss me.

319
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:15,517
Should we do it now?

320
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:20,043
No, let's wait.

321
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:20,870
What's wrong?

322
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,959
Nothing.

323
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:31,707
Am I still waiting?

324
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,536
Mm-hmm.

325
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,538
Okay.

326
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,547
Okay, this is gonna hurt me

327
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:46,461
a lot more than it's gonna

328
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:47,462
hurt you.

329
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:48,115
Just... let's do this.

330
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,246
Okay.

331
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,247
I'm really afraid I'm not gonna

332
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,379
be very good at this.

333
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:52,380
I... i'm a little afraid of

334
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,207
that too, but I think

335
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:53,990
we can do it.

336
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:54,556
Whoo, oh, god.

337
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:55,383
Okay?

338
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,514
What do I do?

339
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:57,472
Do I jam the whole thing in?

340
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,212
Hold it like a pencil.

341
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,169
The tip?

342
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:00,301
Hold it like a pencil.

343
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,258
Hold it at a 90-degree angle

344
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,346
to my skin and then you just...

345
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,391
Just do it really quickly

346
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:04,566
like a dart, like a dart.

347
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:05,436
Okay, but I don't

348
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:06,611
throw it in.

349
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:07,699
I'm... should I just get betsy

350
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,657
to do this at the office?

351
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:09,614
Because...

352
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:10,572
no, no, I can do this.

353
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,486
And don't forget.

354
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:12,617
When you put the...

355
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:13,749
After you put the needle in,

356
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:14,271
just pull it out a tiny bit,

357
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:15,229
check for blood.

358
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,360
If there's no blood,

359
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:17,753
then put the medicine in, okay?

360
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,276
Okay, but if there's blood,

361
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,234
you know, like I might...

362
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,061
I might pass out.

363
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:21,975
I know.

364
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,150
Like, for real.

365
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,107
There's not gonna be blood.

366
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,239
Okay, but if there is,

367
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,414
you're gonna have a needle stuck

368
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,284
in your butt, and I'm gonna be

369
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,416
passed out on the ground.

370
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:29,330
Maybe I should put some pillows

371
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:30,287
down or something

372
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:31,071
like a stuntman has.

373
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:31,811
You know what?

374
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:32,986
Am I just gonna do this?

375
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:33,987
I don't want to hurt myself.

376
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:34,944
Give me the needle.

377
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:35,727
Give me the needle.

378
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,641
Oh, no-no, no.

379
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:37,120
I'm gonna do this.

380
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:37,860
Let's go.

381
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:38,948
I'm ready.

382
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:39,731
I know; You can do this.

383
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,471
On three.

384
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:41,124
Mm-hmm.

385
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:41,951
One.

386
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:42,822
Yeah.

387
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:43,648
Two.

388
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:44,562
Okay.

389
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:45,302
Two and a half.

390
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:46,129
Brian.

391
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:47,087
Ow, ow!

392
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:47,870
Sorry, I'm sorry.

393
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:48,697
Fucker!

394
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:49,654
That hurts.

395
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:50,786
You said like a dart.

396
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,700
Well, not like a frickin'

397
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:52,614
javelin.

398
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:53,528
Well, I'm sorry.

399
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:54,659
What do I do now?

400
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:55,747
Ugh, pull it out a little

401
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,444
bit, see if there's blood.

402
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:57,401
Okay.

403
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:58,838
Oh, that's hurting me.

404
00:13:58,925 --> 00:13:59,839
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

405
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:00,970
No... there's no blood.

406
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:01,928
Good, then would you push

407
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,103
the medicine in?

408
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,278
Okay, I'm go...

409
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:05,235
ugh.

410
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:05,932
Can you be nice to me?

411
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,107
Can...

412
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:08,630
I have got a needle in my ass

413
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:09,718
right now!

414
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:10,371
Okay, okay, here we go.

415
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,111
Ready?

416
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,287
Oh, ow!

417
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:14,244
Eww, gross.

418
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:15,289
Okay, it's so gross.

419
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,638
Okay, okay.

420
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:17,639
The medicine's in.

421
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:19,554
Okay, great, great.

422
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:20,381
What are you doing?

423
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,208
I don't know.

424
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:22,122
I'm waiting.

425
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,297
What do I do now?

426
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,080
Get yourself a ham sandwich.

427
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,168
Pull it out!

428
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,517
Ach.

429
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:27,475
Oh, there's blood, babe.

430
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,563
Oh, there's blood.

431
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,520
Of course there's blood,

432
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:30,478
you frickin' stabbed me.

433
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:31,392
Oh, I don't feel good.

434
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,175
For god's sake.

435
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:32,828
Are you okay?

436
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:33,394
Yes!

437
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:34,221
Are you okay?

438
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,048
I'm sorry.

439
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:35,918
I'm sorry, babe.

440
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:36,876
Ahh.

441
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:37,877
This is not gonna work.

442
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,052
So much blood, babe.

443
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:39,661
Next time, I'm just doing it

444
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:40,749
myself.

445
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:41,706
There was so much blood.

446
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:44,927
Ugh, you are a champ.

447
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:54,328
Shh, come on, come on.

448
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:57,679
Come on, come on.

449
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,724
Uh, honey?

450
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:00,856
In the bathroom.

451
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,684
Yeah, I think he's hungry.

452
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:03,554
Maybe you didn't hear me,

453
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:04,686
sweetie.

454
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:05,774
I said I'm in the bathroom.

455
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:06,906
Yeah.

456
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,081
You think you could deal with

457
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,517
our kid for, like, one second?

458
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,345
Yeah, I got him.

459
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,347
I'm just saying...

460
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:15,871
oh, shh.

461
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,612
Oh, shh.

462
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,440
Oh, shh.

463
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,268
Hey, hey, hey.

464
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,399
She's gonna be here any minute.

465
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:23,879
Sammy, come on.

466
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,011
Come on.

467
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,751
Baby?

468
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,710
Ah.

469
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,407
Shh, here she comes.

470
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:31,713
Come here.

471
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,555
Morning.

472
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:48,991
Hey, did you take a shower?

473
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,079
Why?

474
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,167
What do you mean, "why?"

475
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,255
You were just all sweaty.

476
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:53,343
I'm not sweaty anymore.

477
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,215
Well, you... still on you.

478
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:56,738
You know, we sweat in this

479
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,435
bed more than we sleep in it.

480
00:15:58,522 --> 00:15:59,436
That's sex sweat,

481
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:00,960
not basketball sweat.

482
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,135
There's a difference?

483
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,397
Yes, did you take a shower?

484
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:04,224
Did you hear me

485
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,355
take a shower?

486
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:06,574
Go take a fucking shower,

487
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,531
hon.

488
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,924
Babe, I'm not sweaty.

489
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,926
I'm not sweaty.

490
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,276
Mmm.

491
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,670
You taste sweaty.

492
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:16,932
What does sweat taste like?

493
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,934
Salt, you taste salty.

494
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:19,979
Maybe it is salt.

495
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,154
Mmm?

496
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,155
Maybe I salted my whole body

497
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:22,982
before I came in here.

498
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,810
Ah, did you?

499
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:26,811
No.

500
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,813
No, you didn't, no.

501
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,946
So why don't you...

502
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:31,947
mmm.

503
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,949
Go take a shower?

504
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:38,258
Okay.

505
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,781
Pain in my ass.

506
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:40,608
I love you.

507
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:41,435
Thank you.

508
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:43,611
Fuck you!

509
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:58,800
You dancing?

510
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,280
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

can I take your order?

515
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:09,245
Hi.

516
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:10,377
What do you want?

517
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,467
Um, coke, fries, a burger

518
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,208
with everything.

519
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,818
All right.

520
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,907
Will that be all?

521
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,518
Could you give us one second?

522
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:22,737
Before you order that,

523
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,130
I would like to point out

524
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,740
that when cows are slaughtered,

525
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,307
they are shocked with electric

526
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,569
prods and herded onto

527
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:29,526
the killing floor.

528
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:30,527
Then they are hoisted up

529
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:31,833
by one leg and hung on

530
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,964
a processing line.

531
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,531
Then their necks are slit open,

532
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,706
cutting the jugular vein

533
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,143
as they slowly bleed to death.

534
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,840
Hello, can I take your order?

535
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:41,016
If... if they happen to somehow

536
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,409
miraculously cheat death,

537
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,019
then the animals are fully

538
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,194
conscious as they reach

539
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,717
the scalding tank, as they moo

540
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:47,849
for mercy while they're being

541
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:52,027
boiled alive.

542
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,596
So tell me,

543
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:56,510
do you want to

544
00:17:56,597 --> 00:18:00,905
change your order?

545
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,952
Definitely changing my order.

546
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:09,914
Um, could you hold the mayo?

547
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:10,872
And you?

548
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,526
Sorry about that.

549
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,528
So we'll take a combination

550
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,965
number one, no mayo,

551
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,923
and a caesar salad,

552
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,881
dressing on the side with

553
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,535
a diet coke, thanks.

554
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,624
Chicken caesar?

555
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,328
Hey, baby.

556
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:42,991
What the fuck?

557
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,471
Get your shit out!

558
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:45,298
Put the fucking bat down.

559
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,386
Shut up!

560
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:47,561
Just shut up and get out!

561
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:48,562
I don't even want to

562
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:52,479
look at you right now.

563
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,568
That was a $900 tv.

564
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:55,786
Get out, eric.

565
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,005
Jesus christ, carla,

566
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:57,832
would you look what you did

567
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,442
to the tv?

568
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:00,617
That's my bat.

569
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:01,444
That's my signed yankees bat.

570
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:02,532
You know what?

571
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,620
I'm not even gonna mention

572
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:04,404
the fuckin' bat right now!

573
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:04,795
Get out, eric.

574
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,623
Get out!

575
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,755
Don't talk to me.

576
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,322
Don't look at me.

577
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,279
Just get out.

578
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,281

582
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,031
you didn't even ask me why?

583
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:23,945
Why did I fuck up

584
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:24,815
the television?

585
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:25,729
You just said,

586
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:26,687
that's a $900 tv.

587
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:27,992
That's all you can say.

588
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,429
Not, "carla, clearly something

589
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:30,386
is wrong.

590
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,474
Let's talk about this."

591
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:33,128
No, "that was a $900 tv."

592
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,348
Oh, "you ruined my bat"?

593
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:36,523
We...

594
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,307
eric, I am sick of it, eric.

595
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,004
I am sick of your selfish...

596
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:43,269
Me, me, me, me... all the time.

597
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,226
If just once

598
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,619
you thought of me first.

599
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,316
If just once you said

600
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:48,448
the right thing,

601
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,450
did the right thing for me.

602
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,407
Is that so much to ask?

603
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:52,234
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

604
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,279
wait a minute.

605
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,454
Of course, I am gonna make a big

606
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,629
deal about this.

607
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,152
You just deep to the outfield

608
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,155
with the fuckin' flat screen.

609
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,157
Now, what is wrong?

610
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:02,984
You.

611
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:03,811
You are wrong.

612
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:04,638
Why me?

613
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:05,552
The money.

614
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,901
You took my money.

615
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:07,989
No, no, no, no.

616
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,077
Our money... it is our bank

617
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,165
account.

618
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,079
Who put that money into

619
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,081
our bank account?

620
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:14,169
That's not the point.

621
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,302
Eric, I had been saving

622
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,522
that money for two years.

623
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:20,349
What was it?

624
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:21,307
Basketball?

625
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:22,525
Football?

626
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:23,657
Fucking ice skating?

627
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:25,180
Look, I will get it back.

628
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,660
Great.

629
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,009
You can mail me that money

630
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,837
from your new address.

631
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:30,664
I'll get it back.

632
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:31,752
I promise.

633
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,188
I am not betting on you

634
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,494

Uh, a video camera.

641
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,603
Vhs.

642
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,691
You know what vhs is?

643
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:58,822
Yes, I once heard

644
00:20:58,909 --> 00:20:59,780
my forefathers speak of such

645
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:00,911
a device.

646
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:01,956
Question is, what are you doing

647
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,044
with it?

648
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,045
I found it in the attic.

649
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,220
I was just, you know,

650
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,352
reminiscing, looking at some

651
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,092
old video.

652
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,529
Video?

653
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,313
What kind of video?

654
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,361
Personal video.

655
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,232
A sex tape?

656
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,059
I thought you had to get

657
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,060
to work.

658
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:21,236
Answer the question.

659
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,368
Yes, will, I was looking at

660
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:24,805
old sex tapes.

661
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,633
Tapes?

662
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,288
Well, how many have you... made?

663
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,811
A few...

664
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,726
dozen.

665
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:33,727
What?

666
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:34,554
Oh, come on, it's not

667
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:35,511
a competition.

668
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:36,338
Like, you've never made

669
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:37,426
a sex tape.

670
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:38,558
Yeah, you know, I sexted

671
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,473
a girl in high school once.

672
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,648
Sexted?

673
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:42,779
Yeah, I texted her a picture

674
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:43,650
of my dick, and she sent me

675
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,391
a picture of her boobs.

676
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:49,743
Wow, that sounds fun.

677
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,092
Oh, that's it.

678
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,180
It's on.

679
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,094
What?

680
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,095
What is on?

681
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:54,878
Oh, we're gonna make

682
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:55,836
a sex tape.

683
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:56,967
And it's gonna be so hot

684
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:58,142
that the next time somebody asks

685
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,013
you how many sex tapes you've

686
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,406
made, you're only gonna be able

687
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:03,191
to think of one.

688
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:06,803
Oh, making babies is hard.

689
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,414
How often do we have to do this?

690
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,329
Three times a week.

691
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,504
Ooh, no, no, actually

692
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:12,374
that's not good.

693
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,462
Oh, I know.

694
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:14,637
That's what I'm thinking.

695
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:15,812
I think you're gonna have to

696
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:16,552
find a different life partner.

697
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:17,684
I know.

698
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:18,162
I think you might be right.

699
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,294
Oh.

700
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,469
Well, you'll be happy to know

701
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:21,427
now we get to do the fun part.

702
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:22,341
You're gonna watch me

703
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,298
play video games?

704
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,300
No, I'm ovulating.

705
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,606
We're gonna have sex.

706
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,782
Oh, no.

707
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:29,652
What?

708
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,306
Oh, shit.

709
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,525
What?

710
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:33,961
I did it a little while ago

711
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:34,962
with myself in the bathroom.

712
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:35,832
Babe!

713
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,051
You masturbated?

714
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,226
I had to.

715
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:39,662
You cannot masturbate while

716
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:40,837
we are trying to get pregnant.

717
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:41,664
Why not?

718
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:42,491
I didn't know.

719
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:43,623
I'm ovulating!

720
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,624
I only have, like, 12 hours!

721
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:45,755
This is it.

722
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:46,539
Well, I forgot... 12 hours.

723
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:47,366
I don't care.

724
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:48,497
You know what?

725
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:49,324
Take your frickin' clothes off.

726
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,281
We're fucking.

727
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:50,891
I have to take a rain check.

728
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:52,066
Nope.

729
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:52,893
Respectfully, I have to take

730
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,024
a rain check.

731
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:55,025
You cannot take a rain check.

732
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:55,983
Take your clothes off.

733
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,810
You are fucking me right now.

734
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,170
Honey?

735
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,476
Ah, yeah?

736
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,173
You feel me wet inside you?

737
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,395
Yeah, yeah, oh, baby.

738
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,486
It's so wet on top of you.

739
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:21,443
Yeah.

740
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,401
So wet inside you.

741
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,054
God, yeah.

742
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,012
So what's the fuckin'

743
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,492
big deal?

744
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,058
Why do I got to take a shower?

745
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:29,146
Oh, my god.

746
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,452
You... you have ten seconds

747
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,584
to drop this shit and move on.

748
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:32,541
Or what?

749
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:33,673
Or you'll be finishing

750
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,500
yourself off with your hand

751
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,240
on the couch.

752
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:37,372
I'm just saying.

753
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,504
I just want to fuckin' know.

754
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:39,635
Look, you're sweatier than I

755
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:40,941
ever was at my sweatiest, baby,

756
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,203
and we're in bed.

757
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,378
So I just want to know:

758
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,597
Why do I got to take a shower?

759
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:47,034
Ten, nine, eight...

760
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,122
you know what?

761
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:48,688
You go count all you want.

762
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:49,819
Seven.

763
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:50,646
I'll go finish myself off

764
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:51,778
on the couch.

765
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:52,387
I have more fun without you.

766
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,040
Five?

767
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:53,867
Yeah.

768
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,738
Four.

769
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:56,826
Three.

770
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:57,566
Come on, gina, don't be

771
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:58,524
a bitch.

772
00:23:58,611 --> 00:23:59,481
One.

773
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:00,482
Forget it.

774
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,527
Oh, you fucking suck.

775
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:02,397
You know that?

776
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,398
I know.

777
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,059
What's the deal?

778
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,626
What deal?

779
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:15,541
The sticky note?

780
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:18,544
Sweetie, on the mirror.

781
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:19,545
I 'heart' you?

782
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:24,158
Seriously?

783
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,638
Mm-hmm, 'cause I do.

784
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:26,508
Hmm.

785
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:27,466
What?

786
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:28,728
I... it's a sweet nothing.

787
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,556
A sweet nothing?

788
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:32,427
Mark, come on.

789
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,559
What?

790
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,909
Honey, never once in 11 years

791
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:36,736
have you left me

792
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:37,693
a sweet nothing.

793
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,781
I can't believe this.

794
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:39,826
You're angry at me because

795
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:40,957
I left you a love note.

796
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,350
No, no, no, I'm not angry.

797
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:44,483
I'm suspicious.

798
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,441
Well, I'll think of that

799
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,138
the next time I feel like doing

800
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:48,965
something nice.

801
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:50,445
Oh, okay.

802
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:53,100
So what'd you do?

803
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:54,144
What do you want?

804
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,102
You're crazy.

805
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:56,756
No, I'm not crazy.

806
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:58,366
You... one of two things is going

807
00:24:58,453 --> 00:24:59,498
on here: Either you did

808
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:00,934
something, something stupid,

809
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,022
and that's a preemptive move

810
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:02,805
to make sure that I don't

811
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:03,806
get mad later;

812
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:04,720
Or you want something.

813
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:05,591
You're deranged.

814
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:07,114
Really, I am?

815
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,507
Okay, what'd you do?

816
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:09,464
What do you want?

817
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,465
I didn't do anything.

818
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,379
I don't want anything.

819
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,467
You're paranoid.

820
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,294
I better be.

821
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:14,121
You are.

822
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:14,948
Okay.

823
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:15,949
I'm concerned.

824
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:17,690
Uh-huh.

825
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:18,604
Okay.

826
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:19,474
Okay.

827
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:34,228
Honey?

828
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,664
Thank you for the nice...

829
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:39,320
sticky note.

830
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:40,147
You're welcome.

831
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:46,370
I just want to know that

832
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:48,634
you're okay with it being me.

833
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,810
Sweetie, we discussed this.

834
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,507
It's better if it's you.

835
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,639
I know, but I just feel like

836
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,250
I forced you into the decision.

837
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:57,512
Okay, so how is that

838
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,166
different from every other

839
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:00,167
decision we ever make

840
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,211
as a couple?

841
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:02,212
I just don't...

842
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,126
sweetie, it's good.

843
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,345
This feels right.

844
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:05,738
Besides, if I have a baby,

845
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:06,739
I'm gonna die.

846
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:07,914
Have you seen my hips?

847
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:08,828
What are you saying about

848
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:10,220
my hips?

849
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:11,395
I love your hips.

850
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,527
I know, but if you just want

851
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:13,484
to discuss it, then we can talk

852
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,573
about it right now.

853
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,661
I'm happy, nik, really.

854
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:16,662
I know, but I just don't

855
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:17,401
want you to resent me.

856
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:20,100
I like it this way.

857
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:22,102
Okay, uh,

858
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:23,712
let me just look at it:

859
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,019
Vomiting, bloating, nausea,

860
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:28,761
no alcohol, cankles,

861
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:31,024
flintstone feet, hemorrhoids,

862
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,287
insomnia, stretch marks,

863
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,550
memory loss, back aches,

864
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,204
pelvic pain, postpartum

865
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,423
bleeding, postpartum depression,

866
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,555
nipple blisters,

867
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,687
having to wear a support bra

868
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:42,862
for the next two years.

869
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:43,819
You know what?

870
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:44,951
I think I'm all set.

871
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:45,908
You're really not gonna get

872
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,083
any resentment from me.

873
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,084
Thank you, baby.

874
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,129
It's so sweet.

875
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,217
Thank you.

876
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:53,568
You're gonna be amazing.

877
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,265
What if that stuff happens

878
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,658
to me, though?

879
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:57,616
What are you worried about?

880
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:58,704
Half those things happen

881
00:26:58,791 --> 00:26:59,835
to you already.

882
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:02,055
I do not get nipple blisters.

883
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,404
Okay, so we'll bottle-feed.

884
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:04,535
Oh, no, no, no.

885
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,320
Health... health-wise, it's better

886
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,713
to just, you know, from

887
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,844
the breast.

888
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:09,889
Good for the immune system.

889
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:11,020
Good for bonding.

890
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:13,153
Baby, it's gonna be fine.

891
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,503
You're gonna be fine.

892
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,201
The baby's gonna be fine.

893
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,645
Should we?

894
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,954
No, no, no, I'm not ready.

895
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,129
Not yet.

896
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:35,915
Okay, okay.

897
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,097
It's amazing, huh?

898
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:44,967
What, that he's actually

899
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:46,142
quiet?

900
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,623
No, that he's six weeks old,

901
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,103
today, exactly six weeks

902
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,278
old today.

903
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:54,194
Fuck you, mark.

904
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,935
I am not having sex with you.

905
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:57,110
What?

906
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:58,372
That's what this was about?

907
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:59,199
The sticky note?

908
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,330
I 'heart' you.

909
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:01,288
Because you want to have sex

910
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,463
tonight?

911
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,290
I mean, I've been thinking.

912
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:04,421
Uh-huh.

913
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,510
But the two things aren't

914
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:07,816
anything to do with one another.

915
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:09,122
Sex and the note...

916
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,645
They're mutually exclusive.

917
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:11,777
You are so full of shit.

918
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:12,516
Could you not in front of

919
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:13,648
the baby?

920
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:14,388
What do you think he's thinking

921
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:15,519
right now?

922
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:16,390
I think he's thinking that

923
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:17,521
his dad's a selfish douche bag.

924
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,132
Okay, all... all I'm saying

925
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:21,047
is that the doctor said

926
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:21,874
wait four to six weeks

927
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:22,962
for clearance.

928
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:24,093
Did you see what went on

929
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,225
down there six weeks ago, mark?

930
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:26,356
Did I ask you at week four?

931
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:27,314
No.

932
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:28,358
It was like a grenade

933
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:29,533
went off.

934
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,709
Did I ask you at week five?

935
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:31,710
No.

936
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:32,754
I can't believe you.

937
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,497
God.

938
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:40,675
Babe, I miss you.

939
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:41,720
I want to make love to you

940
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:42,721
again.

941
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,723
Okay, save it, mark.

942
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,855
Seriously, it's not happening,

943
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:47,726
really.

944
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:48,683
Okay.

945
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,513
Okay.

946
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,644
I just want you to know

947
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,692
that I'm ready whenever you are.

948
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,042
Oh, okay.

949
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,000
Thank you.

950
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,697
I will... I will carefully

951
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:03,829
consider that the next time

952
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:04,960
that I am feeling

953
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:09,617
even remotely sexual, okay?

954
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:13,839
Babe, from now on, no more

955
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:14,753
jerking off.

956
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,884
All right.

957
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:16,537
What'd you have for lunch

958
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,364
today?

959
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:18,321
Hot dogs.

960
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:19,018
No, you can't do that

961
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:20,149
anymore.

962
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:20,933
You got to start eating really,

963
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,934
really well.

964
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,109
You got to have a diet

965
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:24,284
high in zinc and antioxidants.

966
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:25,285
We need to up your calcium

967
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,547
intake, your vitamin "d"

968
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:27,548
intake... all of that

969
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:28,375
increases testosterone

970
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:29,768
and sperm count.

971
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:30,856
Okay, good,

972
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:32,031
I can eat all that.

973
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:32,945
And no more drinking.

974
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:33,859
No more alcohol.

975
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:34,685
No more caffeine.

976
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,469
No more sodas.

977
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:36,296
What?

978
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:37,123
Yes.

979
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,037
Really?

980
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:38,864
Yeah, seriously.

981
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:39,995
Sugar is bad.

982
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:41,083
Herbs, flax seed, all that.

983
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,215
Babe, I love flax seed.

984
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:42,911
Babe, you don't even know

985
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,218
what flax seed is.

986
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:46,132
And you're gonna have to

987
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,394
switch to boxers.

988
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:48,874
What, no.

989
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,092
That's a no-go, babe.

990
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,050
I wear briefs.

991
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:51,877
I need support.

992
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,008
Nope.

993
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:53,922
Overheated testicles inhibit

994
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,097
sperm production.

995
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,272
I know you have to say that

996
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,208
at the hospital 'cause you're

997
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:58,492
a nurse, but at home,

998
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:00,450
could you call them balls?

999
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:01,451
No.

1000
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:02,626
Can't you say like,

1001
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:03,584
your hot balls aren't good for

1002
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:04,541
makin' babies?

1003
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:06,108
No, no hot balls.

1004
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:06,935
No hot saunas.

1005
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:07,806
No hot baths.

1006
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:08,981
No biking.

1007
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,634
What, babe, I bike to live.

1008
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,506
Babe, seriously, I have to wear

1009
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,116
briefs because otherwise,

1010
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,465
my balls will start sagging.

1011
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,423
Have you ever seen my dad's

1012
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,598
balls?

1013
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:18,686
Babe, don't talk to

1014
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:19,861
me about your dad's balls.

1015
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:20,775
I have to fuck you right now.

1016
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:21,732
It's only for

1017
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,864
a couple of months.

1018
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:23,822
Would you go without a bra

1019
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:24,779
for a couple of months?

1020
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:25,693
If it got me pregnant.

1021
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,563
All right, fine.

1022
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,651
You don't have to scream at me.

1023
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:28,609
You know, brian, you're

1024
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:29,828
really stressing me out.

1025
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,090
And I'm not supposed to be

1026
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,091
stressed.

1027
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:33,048
It can get in the way of

1028
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:34,354
the cycle of ovulation.

1029
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:35,485
Well, I'm sorry, I guess

1030
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:36,660
I didn't realize this whole

1031
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:37,487
ovulation thing was happening

1032
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:38,575
right now.

1033
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:39,446
Yeah, in the next couple

1034
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:40,577
days.

1035
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:41,752
Wait, if it's in the next

1036
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,841
couple days, what's the hurry?

1037
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:43,798
No, no, no, it's really

1038
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,017
good to have intercourse

1039
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:46,627
before you ovulate because it

1040
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:47,454
increases the chances

1041
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,542
for pregnancy.

1042
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:49,673
Those little guys can live

1043
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,413
up there for, like, four or

1044
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,240
five days.

1045
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:52,241
Eww, really?

1046
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:53,895
That's kind of creepy.

1047
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,288
What are you waiting for?

1048
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,463
Oh, I don't know.

1049
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,420
I thought you're gonna help me

1050
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:58,421
get this party started.

1051
00:30:58,508 --> 00:30:59,379
No, no, no, no, no.

1052
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:00,162
We got to do missionary

1053
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:00,946
position, babe.

1054
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,077
You got to be on top.

1055
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:03,209
It's better for penetration.

1056
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:04,819
Uh, that just sounds lazy

1057
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:05,820
on your part, to be honest.

1058
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,169
And, big guy, I got

1059
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,301
a news flash for you:

1060
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,389
I have to have an orgasm because

1061
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:10,651
the contraction helps get

1062
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:12,000
the sperm up into the cervix.

1063
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:13,219
I'd like to see proof of that

1064
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,568
in writing, please.

1065
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:19,486
Babe...

1066
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:20,530
what are you doing?

1067
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:21,967
Shh.

1068
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,185
Do not shush me.

1069
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,491
I am fantasizing.

1070
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:25,492
Try to pretend that you're not

1071
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:26,319
here.

1072
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:29,322
Babe, I can do that for you

1073
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:30,497
if you want.

1074
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:31,672
We have to be at the

1075
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,848
jacobsons in 35 minutes, okay?

1076
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:34,980
I'm gonna have to lie here with

1077
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,155
my hips elevated for 20 minutes.

1078
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:37,069
It takes nine minutes

1079
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:38,200
to get over there,

1080
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:39,375
which means we have exactly

1081
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,334
six minutes to get this done.

1082
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:42,161
Oh, babe.

1083
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:43,336
Mmm.

1084
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:44,337
All this sexy schedule talk

1085
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:45,164
has got me rock hard.

1086
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:48,558
Let's do this.

1087
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,560
Are you really not gonna help?

1088
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:51,648
All right, fine.

1089
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,999
Two can play at this game.

1090
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,461
Did you fart?

1091
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,810
This is really romantic,

1092
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,725
by the way.

1093
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:25,552
Super...

1094
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:26,379
shh.

1095
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,206
Sexy.

1096
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:29,904
Shh.

1097
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:38,434
♪ Ha-ha-ha-ha ♪

1098
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,523

1099
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,146
hey, you want to, uh...

1100
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:57,062
you want to do it?

1101
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,846
Do it?

1102
00:32:58,933 --> 00:32:59,934
Yeah, you want to?

1103
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,241
You want to do it?

1104
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:04,156
What are you, 12?

1105
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,854
What, I can't say, "do it"?

1106
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:07,855
No, not unless you just

1107
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:10,249
took me to the prom.

1108
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:11,990
Okay, you want to, uh...

1109
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,774
you want... you want to fuck?

1110
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:14,775
Could you just come up with

1111
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:15,645
a happy medium between

1112
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:19,780
do it and "fuck"?

1113
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:20,955
Well, congratulations.

1114
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,392
I'm no longer in the mood.

1115
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:33,968
Okay, let's do it.

1116
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:37,450
Sorry.

1117
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:38,799
Last chance, going once...

1118
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:39,887
you know, maybe when

1119
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:40,714
I learn how to properly...

1120
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:41,976
going twice,

1121
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:42,977
going three times,

1122
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,066
four, five, six, really?

1123
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:46,981
Come on, really?

1124
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,548
Okay.

1125
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,116
Let's do it.

1126
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:52,204
Wow, you really don't seem

1127
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,814
like you want to.

1128
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,076
I don't... I don't understand.

1129
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,122
I don't want to what?

1130
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:58,210
Oh, my god.

1131
00:33:58,297 --> 00:33:59,211
We're gonna do this again?

1132
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,342
No, I want to know.

1133
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:01,474
I just want to know how you

1134
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:02,301
are supposed to properly ask

1135
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:02,866
your spouse...

1136
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:03,824
have sex.

1137
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,652
Do you want to have sex?

1138
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:08,698
Yes.

1139
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:10,309
Can I just finish this chapter

1140
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:11,658
first?

1141
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:15,749
I'm, like, a page and a half.

1142
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:16,663
Sure.

1143
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,536
Thanks.

1144
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:22,016
J.t., it really bothers me

1145
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,148
that you eat meat.

1146
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,714
What do you want from me?

1147
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:25,628
All right, it's meat.

1148
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,108
It's a food group.

1149
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,327
No, it's not.

1150
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:29,676
Protein is a food group.

1151
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:32,157
Meat is murder.

1152
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:33,680
No, a food group:

1153
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,334
Beef, poultry, fish.

1154
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,510
Dried beans, eggs, tofu,

1155
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:38,641
nuts.

1156
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:39,686
All protein, all in the same

1157
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:41,383
food group.

1158
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,515
Look, all right, I've been

1159
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:43,646
eating meat since I was two.

1160
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:47,607
Okay, I can't just stop now.

1161
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:54,918
What if I gave you

1162
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:58,183
an incentive?

1163
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,795
What if I motivated you?

1164
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:04,885
How?

1165
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,756
What if I slept with you?

1166
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:12,197
You mean, we... we can have sex.

1167
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:14,373
If you stop eating meat,

1168
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,723
yeah.

1169
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,378
When?

1170
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:20,901
Tonight.

1171
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:21,815
Okay, are you messing

1172
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:23,904
with me?

1173
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,558
Okay, you're messing with me.

1174
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:29,605
No, I'm not messing with you.

1175
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:30,737
I wouldn't be messing about

1176
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:33,783
something like this.

1177
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,959
If you stop eating meat,

1178
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:38,397
I'll have sex with you...

1179
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:41,922
tonight after dinner.

1180
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,272
Yeah, hey, hey, can you...

1181
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:45,969
Can you change that combo

1182
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,929
number one to a caesar salad?

1183
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:50,104
No chicken.

1184
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,150
Thank you.

1185
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:02,247
So is that, like, the most

1186
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:03,422
incredible chapter in

1187
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,423
the history of the world,

1188
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,424
or am I just the most

1189
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:06,338
boring lay ever?

1190
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:07,469
No, no, no, no.

1191
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:08,601
It's just... i'm almost done.

1192
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:09,384
If I stop now, I got to pick it

1193
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:10,516
up all the way...

1194
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:11,212
oh, yeah, no, totally, honey.

1195
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:12,387
I totally get it.

1196
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:13,562
You know, if you'd just let

1197
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:14,476
me finish, I'd be done by now.

1198
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:15,564
If we'd had sex,

1199
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:16,130
you'd probably by now too.

1200
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,784
Wow, okay.

1201
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:19,177
Book's down.

1202
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:22,789
Top or bottom?

1203
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,444
What, you want to flip for it?

1204
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:26,358
Rock, paper, scissors?

1205
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,189
What happened to us?

1206
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,190
What, what do you mean,

1207
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:33,191
what happened?

1208
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,366
I mean, when did...

1209
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:37,630
having sex become such a chore?

1210
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,632
Ch... it's not a chore.

1211
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,850
I love having sex with you.

1212
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:42,069
Yeah, well, we're doing it,

1213
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:43,157
honey, but I mean, when did

1214
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,158
getting there become one?

1215
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,115
This is so sad.

1216
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,160
We should just put it on

1217
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,161
the chore wheel.

1218
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,162
Unload the dishwasher.

1219
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:48,902
Take out the garbage.

1220
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:49,859
Have sex.

1221
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:50,295
That's ridiculous.

1222
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:51,470
Is it?

1223
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:52,993
Yeah, there's nothing I like

1224
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,040
more than having sex with you.

1225
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:59,739
Masturbating.

1226
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,306
What about it?

1227
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:02,176
When was the last time

1228
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,917
we had sex?

1229
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:04,874
I don't know.

1230
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,049
Exactly, and when was

1231
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,487
the last time you masturbated?

1232
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:10,663
I don't know.

1233
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,186
Oh, yeah, you do know

1234
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:13,927
because it was this morning

1235
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,102
in the shower.

1236
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,409
Oh, no, don't deny it.

1237
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:18,366
No one goes through that much

1238
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:19,541
conditioner in one week.

1239
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:20,673
All right, fine, you got me.

1240
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,763
I... I like jerking off.

1241
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,330
I don't know what to say.

1242
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,461
Okay, well, I... look, honey,

1243
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:27,419
I have no problem with that.

1244
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:28,681
But you just said,

1245
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:29,769
there's nothing I like more

1246
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:30,857
than having sex with you.

1247
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,250
And I would argue that you

1248
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:33,729
actually enjoy masturbating more

1249
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:34,687
than having sex with me.

1250
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:35,862
I don't enjoy it more.

1251
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:36,689
It's just...

1252
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:37,864
It's quicker.

1253
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:38,691
It's easier.

1254
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:40,345
It's cleaner.

1255
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:41,520
It's cleaner.

1256
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:42,521
Because of all the hair products

1257
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:43,652
you use?

1258
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:44,784
Are you gonna start hiding

1259
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:45,524
the conditioner from me now?

1260
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:47,439
Oh, god.

1261
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,092
Honey, look, I get it.

1262
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,050
I'm not trying to make you

1263
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,399
feel bad for jerking off

1264
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:52,270
once in a while.

1265
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,707
Well, you are.

1266
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:55,838
I don't know.

1267
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:58,101
I... I think about how we used to

1268
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:02,062
be, you know?

1269
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,237
All right.

1270
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,586
Well, think about it this way,

1271
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,893
think of... think of all the times

1272
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,329
we fight and all the times

1273
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,374
we argue,

1274
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,592
when we were planning our

1275
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,680
wedding, when we try and figure

1276
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:14,553
out a trip to see your mom

1277
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,337
or who's gonna walk the dogs...

1278
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,296
I mean, all the times I'm not

1279
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:19,297
jerking off.

1280
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,341
I jerk off for peace.

1281
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:21,734
I jerk off for harmony.

1282
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:22,996
I don't just jerk off for me.

1283
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,171
I jerk off for us.

1284
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,956
So I'm asking you, please,

1285
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:28,480
I would love to have sex

1286
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,699
with my wife.

1287
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:34,529
Not now.

1288
00:38:34,616 --> 00:38:35,661
Oh, my god, why?

1289
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:36,662
Well, honey, I'm not

1290
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:37,402
a charity, you know...

1291
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:38,490
charity?

1292
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:39,621
That's just humiliating.

1293
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,753
I'm not... there's no char...

1294
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,623
There's nothing I like more

1295
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,842
than having sex with you.

1296
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,931
Except for finishing

1297
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,585
chapter nine of

1298
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:48,282
harriet tubman's biography.

1299
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:51,459
Screw her.

1300
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:54,114
Mmm, okay, wait, wait,

1301
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,071
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1302
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:56,421
Honey, let's just do it

1303
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:57,422
in the morning, okay?

1304
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:58,597
Tomorrow morning...

1305
00:38:58,684 --> 00:38:59,554
When was the last time we had

1306
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:00,512
sex in the morning?

1307
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,295
We never have sex

1308
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,470
in the morning.

1309
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:03,341
I think kennedy was president.

1310
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:04,298
Well, then there you go.

1311
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,081
Sex in the morning.

1312
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:06,126
It's a date.

1313
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:07,301
Okay, we got a date.

1314
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,304
Mm-hmm.

1315
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:18,312
Wait, you're not even gonna

1316
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,313
finish your chapter?

1317
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,793
No, the sooner we go

1318
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,708
to sleep, the sooner we wake up,

1319
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:23,622
and then the sooner

1320
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,754
we can do it.

1321
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:44,904
Carla, I'm not walking out

1322
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,079
that door till you look me

1323
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,254
in the eyes and tell me you...

1324
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:48,255
I really want you to leave.

1325
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,169
I don't believe you.

1326
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:50,170
Well, maybe you'll believe

1327
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:51,084
me if I call the cops.

1328
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:51,911
You're not gonna

1329
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:52,694
call the cops.

1330
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:53,478
Watch me.

1331
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,044
Well, I still don't

1332
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:56,176
believe you.

1333
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,351
Hi, this is carla watkins.

1334
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,005
I live at 4242 jefferson street,

1335
00:39:59,092 --> 00:39:59,962
apartment number "c,"

1336
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:00,963
and I have an intruder.

1337
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,051
I'm not an intruder.

1338
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:02,965
Carla, hang up the phone.

1339
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:04,053
He has a knife.

1340
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,011
A knife?

1341
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,360
Oh, great, a knife.

1342
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:07,317
You might want to leave now

1343
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,493
before you get shot.

1344
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,276
Well, that is really adult,

1345
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:10,495
carla, nice.

1346
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:12,105
Really, you're gonna teach me

1347
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:13,236
how to be an adult now?

1348
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:14,499
Okay, well, I will sit down

1349
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:16,022
and take notes while you explain

1350
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:17,153
to me how to be an adult.

1351
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:17,719
This isn't about the bank

1352
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:18,894
account.

1353
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,069
This is about something else.

1354
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:21,157
Because me being upset about

1355
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:21,897
getting robbed would be so

1356
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,072
immature?

1357
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:23,986
Are you seeing someone else?

1358
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:24,596
Is that what this is about?

1359
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:25,684
What?

1360
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:26,815
Seeing somebody else, me?

1361
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:27,990
Yes, that's the question.

1362
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:29,209
No, I'm not seeing somebody

1363
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,689
else, you fucking retard.

1364
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:31,646
Well, do you think

1365
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:32,778
I'm cheating on you?

1366
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:33,909
Is that what this is about?

1367
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:34,693
No, you're too unambitious

1368
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,781
to cheat.

1369
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:36,956
That would require having

1370
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:37,913
a conversation with somebody.

1371
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,045
Carla, I love you.

1372
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:39,741
I would do anything for you.

1373
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:41,134
Great, leave!

1374
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:42,091
Fine, you want me to leave?

1375
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:42,918
Yes.

1376
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:43,876
I'll leave.

1377
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,007
I'm fuckin' leaving.

1378
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:45,921
Okay, great, and don't forget

1379
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:46,705
your fucking bat!

1380
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:48,446
Sayonara, bitch.

1381
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,882
You know what, eric?

1382
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,884
I will get down on my knees and

1383
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:53,320
blow you right now if you can

1384
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:56,889
tell me what language that is.

1385
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:58,238
It's hong kong.

1386
00:40:58,325 --> 00:40:59,892
You are a retard.

1387
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,284
Fuckin' chinese.

1388
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:02,460
I thought you were leaving.

1389
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:03,548
You can't even do that right.

1390
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:04,549
Fine, okay, you want me

1391
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:05,680
to ask some questions?

1392
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:06,594
I would really like to know

1393
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:07,726
what's wrong.

1394
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:08,727
Besides you stealing

1395
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:09,815
from me.

1396
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:10,946
I didn't steal from you.

1397
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:11,599
What would you call that,

1398
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:12,731
eric?

1399
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:13,514
I had money, and you took it

1400
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:14,384
without asking.

1401
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,211
What would you call that?

1402
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:16,386
Relax, okay?

1403
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,518
Don't you tell me to relax.

1404
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:18,301
Don't ever tell me to relax.

1405
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:19,302
Do you hear me?

1406
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:20,478
Look, I am sorry.

1407
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:21,914
Don't you fucking touch me.

1408
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,742
Don't touch me.

1409
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:27,093
We're not kids anymore, eric.

1410
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,487
I was sitting at this stoplight

1411
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,576
yesterday.

1412
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:34,100
And I realized everybody was

1413
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:37,190
walking or driving or going

1414
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,758
somewhere but me.

1415
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,977
I was just sitting still.

1416
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:42,935
Well, that's what you do

1417
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:43,762
at a red light.

1418
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,590
We, eric.

1419
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:48,114
We are sitting still.

1420
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:49,289
You know, I don't know

1421
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:50,943
why you hate me so much.

1422
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,772
I don't hate you, eric.

1423
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:54,903
That's the problem.

1424
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,603
I wish I could fucking hate you.

1425
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:12,094
Oh, don't even.

1426
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:32,201
I am so exhausted.

1427
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:35,683
How could something so tiny

1428
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,033
make me so tired?

1429
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,860
Do you need me to get you

1430
00:42:38,947 --> 00:42:39,687
anything?

1431
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:40,862
Oh, my god.

1432
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,342
I am not having sex with you.

1433
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:43,517
I just asked you if you

1434
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:44,649
wanted me to get you anything.

1435
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,651
I could hear the subtext.

1436
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:47,608
There was no subtext.

1437
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:49,001
There was subtext.

1438
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,524
So anytime I say something

1439
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:51,612
nice, you're just going to

1440
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:52,657
automatically think I have

1441
00:42:52,744 --> 00:42:53,745
an ulterior motive?

1442
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:56,095
Honey, I love you, I do,

1443
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:57,226
okay?

1444
00:42:57,313 --> 00:43:01,883
But I got to get some sleep.

1445
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,842
That is so hot.

1446
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:06,540
What?

1447
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:08,629
The moon.

1448
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:10,544
Oh, my god, mark, come on.

1449
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,285
Just stop it, all right?

1450
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:13,416
Leave me alone.

1451
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:15,462
I have been leaving you alone

1452
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:19,118
for six weeks.

1453
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:20,554
Okay, you know what?

1454
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,556
I'll jerk you off, hmm?

1455
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:23,470
Let's do that.

1456
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:24,558
It'll be fun.

1457
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:25,603
That's not what this is

1458
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,865
about.

1459
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:28,301
It's gonna be fun, come on.

1460
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:30,042
No, no, no, no, no.

1461
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:31,739
You're missing the point.

1462
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,045
This is not... i'm not...

1463
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:34,002
This is not...

1464
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:35,177
what, you're not what?

1465
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:36,570
You're not turned on anymore?

1466
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:37,527
What happened?

1467
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,485
Is it... oh, it was this,

1468
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:39,094
was what you liked?

1469
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:40,052
No.

1470
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:41,140
That's the thing.

1471
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:42,054
That's what you need to...

1472
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:42,881
That's good?

1473
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:43,708
No.

1474
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:44,883
No?

1475
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,580
Wait, it's... yeah, actually,

1476
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:47,581
that's hot.

1477
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,583
Okay, good.

1478
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,497
So what do you think?

1479
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:51,498
A little journey?

1480
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:52,412
A little night ranger?

1481
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:53,543
Very weird.

1482
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,457
I put some charlie perfume

1483
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:55,633
on, get you going?

1484
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,419
Wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

1485
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:01,421
I want to make love.

1486
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:02,248
My god.

1487
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:03,597
Come on.

1488
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:07,601
Mark, I can't.

1489
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:08,428
Why?

1490
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:10,822
I can't.

1491
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:15,000
I feel... I feel disgusting, okay?

1492
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,915
I feel fat.

1493
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:20,309
And I just... I feel like there's

1494
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:23,182
like an apron of skin

1495
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,923
around my waist.

1496
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,361
It's... I don't feel sexy.

1497
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:31,581
I think you're sexy.

1498
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,713
Yeah, well, that's 'cause

1499
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,106
you haven't had sex with me yet.

1500
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:35,498
Trust me, once you have sex

1501
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:37,283
with me, you will see how

1502
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,327
disgusting I am.

1503
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:39,938
You're not disgusting.

1504
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:40,765
You're perfect.

1505
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:42,331
I am.

1506
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:44,725
I have stretch marks everywhere,

1507
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:47,119
on my legs, my butt, my boobs,

1508
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:48,773
my... have you seen my stomach?

1509
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,774
Yeah.

1510
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,298
It's like an atlas.

1511
00:44:52,385 --> 00:44:53,865
It's...

1512
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:55,170
I'm never gonna be the same.

1513
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:57,303
My body is never gonna look

1514
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,827
the same.

1515
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:00,959
No, don't...

1516
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:01,960
look, I love these marks.

1517
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:03,048
I do.

1518
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:04,397
I love the way they feel.

1519
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:05,398
They're like... they're like

1520
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:06,529
guides.

1521
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:10,838
It's like... like a blueprint

1522
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:12,187
showing me the way across

1523
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:14,712
your body.

1524
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:17,497
I love them. I do.

1525
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:20,805
Oh.

1526
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:21,762
Hmm?

1527
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:25,679
Thanks for the effort.

1528
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:29,727
Well, get some sleep, babe.

1529
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,863
If I tell you to stop,

1530
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,432
you have to stop right away.

1531
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:40,738
And also, if you wake up

1532
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:41,564
that baby...

1533
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:42,478
uh-huh.

1534
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:43,436
I will kill you.

1535
00:45:43,523 --> 00:45:44,089
I'm not gonna wake up

1536
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:44,916
the baby.

1537
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:45,873
Okay.

1538
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,048
I'm gonna go slow.

1539
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,223
And you can't touch my boobs

1540
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,007
at all 'cause they're really,

1541
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:49,964
really sore.

1542
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:50,530
I know, but it's okay.

1543
00:45:50,617 --> 00:45:52,706
No, no.

1544
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:55,013
And don't touch me there.

1545
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,014
Where can I touch you?

1546
00:45:57,276 --> 00:45:58,581
Come here.

1547
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:00,409
Mmm.

1548
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,718
Oh, my god.

1549
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:05,719
Oh, my god.

1550
00:46:36,315 --> 00:46:37,969
How's your dinner?

1551
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:42,800
It's incredible.

1552
00:46:42,887 --> 00:46:45,411
You'll get used to it.

1553
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:47,413
Can I eat fish?

1554
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,850
Sure, to-fish.

1555
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:51,678
To-fish?

1556
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:54,115
Mm-hmm, tofu fish.

1557
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:56,901
You can also have tofurky,

1558
00:46:56,988 --> 00:46:59,425
tofu burgers, and soysage.

1559
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:01,079
S-soysage?

1560
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:02,123
Is that... is that like

1561
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,343
soy sausage?

1562
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,433
Oh, sounds really good.

1563
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,608
The rule of thumb is that

1564
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:11,176
if it has a heartbeat or a face,

1565
00:47:11,263 --> 00:47:12,699
you can't eat it.

1566
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,353
I saw on ebay once

1567
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,658
there was this grilled cheese

1568
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:16,877
sandwich that had the virgin

1569
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:19,314
mary's face grilled into it.

1570
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:21,012
What about that?

1571
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:23,188
I'd allow it.

1572
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:26,104
Yeah, I hate salad,

1573
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:27,453
just so you know.

1574
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,847
You'll grow to like it.

1575
00:47:36,201 --> 00:47:38,159
That feels good.

1576
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,508
Whoo.

1577
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:42,903
Good.

1578
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:54,784
Further down.

1579
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:01,879
Right there.

1580
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:09,843
Oh, right there.

1581
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,858
Mmm.

1582
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:27,252
Further down.

1583
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:28,253
Babe, I think I'm at

1584
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,907
the right spot.

1585
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:32,561
Mmm, go further to my feet.

1586
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,172
Rub my feet.

1587
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:35,521
No, boring.

1588
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:39,046
Please rub my feet.

1589
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:40,439
Grr.

1590
00:48:59,066 --> 00:48:59,806
You're tickling.

1591
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,766
I swear you do that on purpose

1592
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:04,593
so you don't have to

1593
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,594
rub my feet.

1594
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:07,292
It's not true.

1595
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,033
If we have any chance of

1596
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,251
lasting, you are gonna have to

1597
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:11,078
learn to give me a proper

1598
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:12,427
foot massage.

1599
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:14,908
Oh, are we at risk of

1600
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:17,041
failing?

1601
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:18,956
Ten years and you still don't

1602
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:20,000
know how to rub my feet

1603
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:20,958
properly.

1604
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:21,915
I just... I don't know if

1605
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,047
11's gonna happen, babe.

1606
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:25,223
Oh.

1607
00:49:29,227 --> 00:49:32,230
12 years, be a stretch.

1608
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:34,362
Mm-hmm.

1609
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:42,805
13 if you're lucky.

1610
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:53,729
Okay, let's make a baby.

1611
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:05,089
So are you ready?

1612
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:07,526
Uh, ready... ready for what?

1613
00:50:07,613 --> 00:50:09,354
To go buy condoms.

1614
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:12,792
Oh, I have one.

1615
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:14,707
You have one?

1616
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:16,622
Yeah, I have one.

1617
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:18,711
Why do you have one?

1618
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:20,974
Just in case.

1619
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:22,062
Oh, just in case

1620
00:50:22,149 --> 00:50:23,237
susie rinkmeyers wants to

1621
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:24,978
take you behind the bleachers?

1622
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:28,851
No, you know, just in case

1623
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:33,465
you and I ever had sex.

1624
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:35,467
So you bought it for me?

1625
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:39,123
Yeah.

1626
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,473
Well, no, I've actually had it

1627
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,909
in my wallet since the sixth

1628
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:44,041
grade.

1629
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:45,042
So you've been carrying it

1630
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:45,825
around for four years

1631
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:47,522
in your wallet.

1632
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:49,133
Yeah, it's got

1633
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,396
an expiration date on it.

1634
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:55,661
Listen, babe, we don't have

1635
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:57,010
to do this.

1636
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,359
Okay, we can... we can go see

1637
00:50:58,446 --> 00:50:59,317
a movie.

1638
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:02,494
No, I want to.

1639
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:07,151
I do.

1640
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:09,327
Okay.

1641
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:17,074
Just give me a second here.

1642
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:26,344
Well, this goes slow.

1643
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:34,439
Are you gonna take off

1644
00:51:34,526 --> 00:51:36,049
your pants?

1645
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:38,399
Oh, right, that would help.

1646
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:41,707
Yeah, right.

1647
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:59,290
Wait, um, we should probably...

1648
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:00,552
we should probably put something

1649
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,468
down on the seat.

1650
00:52:07,863 --> 00:52:10,083
Yeah.

1651
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:18,744
This is so fucking weird.

1652
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:20,572
Right?

1653
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:21,442
Do you want me to take

1654
00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:22,313
my dress off?

1655
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,183
Yes.

1656
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,664
Okay.

1657
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:29,929
Okay, wait.

1658
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:32,105
Someone might walk by.

1659
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,760
Yeah, okay.

1660
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:40,418
Just waitin' on you, so...

1661
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:41,462
anytime.

1662
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:43,160
Right.

1663
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:44,117
Here we go.

1664
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:46,946
Here we go.

1665
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:54,780
What's your favorite color?

1666
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:57,348
I'm not picky.

1667
00:53:03,092 --> 00:53:04,877
Let's start with red.

1668
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:05,834
We can work our way

1669
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:07,793
through the rainbow.

1670
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,620
Why don't we move onto

1671
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:09,621
the bed?

1672
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:12,189
No, I like it here.

1673
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:41,827
You look good in red.

1674
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:45,657
Huh, thank you.

00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:53,839

tape over this?

1687
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:23,260
Yeah, of course, why not?

1688
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:24,435
It's your daughter's ballet

1689
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:25,566
recital.

1690
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:29,614
My daughter hates ballet.

1691
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:32,356
Oh.

1692
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:33,705
So...

1693
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:36,229
so...

1694
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:37,317
are we rolling?

1695
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:38,405
Yeah, we're rolling.

1696
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:41,103
Mm, I don't know if this

1697
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,236
is a good idea to have on tape.

1698
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:45,238
Really, and why's that?

1699
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:47,719
Well, it could be used

1700
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:49,155
against me in the trial.

1701
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:50,112
And what would you be

1702
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:50,939
on trial for?

1703
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:56,815
Fucking you to death.

1704
00:54:58,556 --> 00:55:01,254
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1705
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:02,603
I didn't call action.

1706
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,953
Oh, that's mean.

1707
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,954
What's our framing like?

1708
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:06,912
Are we in a wide shot

1709
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:08,348
or a close-up... what?

1710
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:09,306
Uh, it's a wide shot.

1711
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:10,437
Who's gonna watch

1712
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:12,004
a sex tape in a wide shot?

1713
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:12,831
Nobody.

1714
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:13,919
Nobody.

1715
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:15,921
No one's gonna watch it.

1716
00:55:16,008 --> 00:55:16,965
Right?

1717
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:18,140
Well, you never know.

1718
00:55:18,227 --> 00:55:19,272
These days with the internets

1719
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,795
and the kids and their sexting,

1720
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:22,144
it could get out there.

1721
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:23,755
You just fucking with me?

1722
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:26,410
I don't know; Am I?

1723
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:29,326
Am I?

1724
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:31,371
Let me get the camera.

1725
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:38,291
Baby, I think it's time.

1726
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:39,292
Okay.

1727
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:41,773
Okay.

1728
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,471
Oh, that's a lot of semen.

1729
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:45,646
Well, it's mixed with

1730
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,169
preservation fluid to promote

1731
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:49,128
motility.

1732
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:52,044
Mmm.

1733
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,791
Okay.

1734
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:05,884
Are you doing it right now?

1735
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:09,322
Now I am.

1736
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:12,673
Mmm, this is not how

1737
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,632
I imagined it as a girl.

1738
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,026
Not at all.

1739
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:20,812
How did you imagine it, baby?

1740
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:24,206
It was my wedding night

1741
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:27,819
after a electric courtship

1742
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:29,473
at a cliffside wedding.

1743
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,344
Wait, don't move.

1744
00:56:31,431 --> 00:56:32,476
You have to stay on your back

1745
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:36,044
for a few minutes.

1746
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,003
Okay.

1747
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,091
Good?

1748
00:56:39,178 --> 00:56:41,485
Yeah, okay, keep going.

1749
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:42,660
Your wedding?

1750
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:44,488
Uh, and it was a huge

1751
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:47,360
ceremony with these fountains

1752
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:49,231
of flowing champagne

1753
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:51,756
and flowing silk.

1754
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,018
And they were serving lobster

1755
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,889
bisque.

1756
00:56:54,976 --> 00:56:56,848
And oh, there were white little

1757
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:59,067
doves with my train in their

1758
00:56:59,154 --> 00:57:02,288
beaks flying like in snow white.

1759
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:06,074
And, uh, yeah, a long parade

1760
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,554
of naked bridesmaids.

1761
00:57:11,384 --> 00:57:12,951
Naked bridesmaids.

1762
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:13,908
Yeah, I didn't figure that

1763
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:14,822
one out until I was late

1764
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:16,041
into high school.

1765
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:18,130
They were there at my wedding.

1766
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:23,483
And, uh, after the wedding?

1767
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:24,528
Oh, well, of course

1768
00:57:24,615 --> 00:57:26,878
my gray-bearded husband

1769
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:28,401
whisked me off into this

1770
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,055
horse-drawn carriage, and we go

1771
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:31,883
to our castle.

1772
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,711
And the evening culminates

1773
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:36,278
into the ultimate act of love.

1774
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:37,323
Then nine months later...

1775
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:39,325
baby.

1776
00:57:53,992 --> 00:57:55,123
Please, please don't make me

1777
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,211
stop a second time.

1778
00:57:56,298 --> 00:57:56,995
What... what's the matter?

1779
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:57,996
The water.

1780
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,084
What is it too hot?

1781
00:57:59,171 --> 00:57:59,563
No, it just doesn't work

1782
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,478
in here.

1783
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:03,175
Sorry.

1784
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:08,572
Oh, baby, you should've said

1785
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:09,442
something.

1786
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,313
Yeah, okay.

1787
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,361
I'm ready.

1788
00:58:15,448 --> 00:58:16,493
Whoa.

1789
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,363
What the fuck are you doing?

1790
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,495
What?

1791
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:19,626
Baby, that's disgusting.

1792
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:22,020
You got to be kidding me.

1793
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:23,325
You spit on your dick every time

1794
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:24,152
we have sex.

1795
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,328
It's my spit.

1796
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:27,939
Okay, okay, no, go ahead.

1797
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:31,682
Go ahead.

1798
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:33,988
Oh, yeah.

1799
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:35,555
Oh, my god.

1800
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:39,037
God, I love you.

1801
00:58:39,951 --> 00:58:40,691
What?

1802
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:44,477
More spit.

1803
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:46,131
Why?

1804
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:47,480
'Cause it turned me on.

1805
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,003
I thought it disgusted you.

1806
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,483
That's why you turn me on.

1807
00:58:56,228 --> 00:58:57,838
Oh, yeah.

1808
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:05,324
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1809
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:06,804
Wait, what?

1810
00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:08,196
No, you said you had to orgasm.

1811
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:09,328
I know. I just did.

1812
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:10,503
No, I don't think so.

1813
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,678
Usually when you orgasm,

1814
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:12,418
it's really loud and you swear

1815
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:13,419
a lot.

1816
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:14,551
I know, but that's...

1817
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:15,726
That's just for show, you know.

1818
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:16,857
I just... I didn't want to make

1819
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:17,466
any noise and push all the semen

1820
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,119
out.

1821
00:59:18,206 --> 00:59:18,946
What do you mean

1822
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:20,121
it's for show?

1823
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,079
I mean, 'cause you like it.

1824
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,646
Well, yeah... uh...

1825
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:23,560
this just keeps getting

1826
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:24,561
better and better.

1827
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:25,387
Okay, get out of me.

1828
00:59:25,474 --> 00:59:26,475
Get out of me.

1829
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,085
Would you get me a pillow

1830
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:28,020
please?

1831
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,000
Put it under my hips.

1832
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:30,001
I need to keep my hips elevated.

1833
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:31,002
All right.

1834
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:32,003
At a 30-degree angle

1835
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,352
for 20 minutes.

1836
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:34,309
Why?

1837
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:36,268
To keep the semen in.

1838
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:37,225
Oh, of course.

1839
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:38,009
Got to keep that semen...

1840
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:51,675
what are you doing there?

1841
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:53,241
I'm trying to relax

1842
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:54,765
my vaginal muscles,

1843
00:59:54,852 --> 00:59:57,681
easing the cervical mucus flow

1844
00:59:57,768 --> 00:59:59,465
so that the sperm gets to

1845
00:59:59,552 --> 01:00:00,727
the egg more quickly

1846
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:02,773
and effectively.

1847
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,905
Cool.

1848
01:00:04,992 --> 01:00:07,212
Hey, could you do me a favor?

1849
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:09,562
Can you never use the phrase

1850
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:10,955
cervical mucus flow around me

1851
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:11,869
again?

1852
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:13,044
That'd be awesome.

1853
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:15,394
Don't... don't make me laugh.

1854
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:16,874
I don't want to spew out

1855
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:18,789
all your splooge.

1856
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:20,704
Wait, so you'll say splooge

1857
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,749
but you won't say balls?

1858
01:00:22,836 --> 01:00:24,577
That doesn't make any sense.

1859
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:27,580
Should I go get dressed

1860
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:28,712
or is that gonna ruin

1861
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,061
this incredibly romantic moment

1862
01:00:30,148 --> 01:00:35,066
we're having together?

1863
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,284
Babe, I'm sorry.

1864
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:38,504
I know this is all weird

1865
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:41,942
and crazy.

1866
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:42,769
I just really want to have

1867
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:45,119
a baby.

1868
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:45,946
I know.

1869
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:46,904
Me too.

1870
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:51,082
Me too.

1871
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:53,519
We're figuring it out.

1872
01:00:53,606 --> 01:00:54,738
I think this was the one.

1873
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:55,739
You do?

1874
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:56,914
I'm pretty sure I just

1875
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:58,611
dumped a baby inside you.

1876
01:00:58,698 --> 01:00:59,612
I hope so.

1877
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:02,006
Me too.

1878
01:01:02,093 --> 01:01:02,920
All right, I'm gonna go

1879
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:04,095
get dressed.

1880
01:01:04,182 --> 01:01:05,052
Okay...

1881
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:06,663
no, stay, stay, stay.

1882
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,273
Okay.

1883
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:23,114
I didn't gamble the money.

I fucking hate you.

1892
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:52,317
Why didn't you tell me?

1893
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:53,231
Well, after you beat down

1894
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:54,188
the television,

1895
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:56,277
I was reconsidering.

1896
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,806
So...

1897
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:05,373
will you marry me?

1898
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,811
No.

1899
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:09,377
Absolutely not.

1900
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:10,988
I would die for you.

1901
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:13,686
I know.

1902
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:16,341
That's morbid.

1903
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:17,690
It's sweet, though.

1904
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:19,039
I would. I would die for you.

1905
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:20,519
I'll keep that in mind

1906
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:21,346
if the opportunity ever

1907
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:23,827
presents itself.

1908
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:38,319
Come make love to me.

1909
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:45,065
Is it Korean?

1910
01:02:45,152 --> 01:02:46,110
Oh, shut up before I change

1911
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:48,199
my mind.

1912
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,119
Baby, this is so...

1913
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:56,033
oh!

1914
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:03,214
Oh, tell me you love me.

1915
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:04,128
I love you, baby.

1916
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:06,043
Oh, oh, louder!

1917
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:06,870
I love you, baby.

1918
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:16,227
Oh, baby.

1919
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:19,230
Oh, my god.

1920
01:03:21,232 --> 01:03:23,321
Oh, my god.

1921
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:29,414
Why else?

1922
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:31,068
What?

1923
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:34,245
Why else do you love me?

1924
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:38,466
I can't help it.

1925
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:42,862
You are the girl of my dreams.

1926
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:43,907
You're the girl I used to

1927
01:03:43,994 --> 01:03:47,345
fantasize about as a kid.

1928
01:03:47,432 --> 01:03:51,523
And now, I got you.

1929
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,090
I got you.

1930
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:56,658
I fucking love you.

1931
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:58,443
I love you.

1932
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:06,930
Let's go to bed.

1933
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:09,802
Yeah.

1934
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:14,024
Right after you take a shower.

1935
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:20,117
Okay, let's hear it.

1936
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:21,727
Hear what?

1937
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:23,642
Your sex talk.

1938
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:24,773
My what?

1939
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:25,644
Mmm, yeah, I want to hear you

1940
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:27,341
talk dirty to me.

1941
01:04:27,428 --> 01:04:28,516
Oh, okay.

1942
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:31,302
Um, okay, just give a second.

1943
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:34,653
Mm-hmm.

1944
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,567
All right, I'll jump-start

1945
01:04:35,654 --> 01:04:36,394
you, okay.

1946
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:39,919
Thank you.

1947
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:43,009
Mmm, oh, that feels good.

1948
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:46,360
Oh, okay, yeah, oh, yeah.

1949
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:47,971
Oh, your boobs...

1950
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:49,886
Yes, I love it when you bounce

1951
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,148
your boobs like that, like a...

1952
01:04:51,235 --> 01:04:54,238
Like a bouncy house, yeah!

1953
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:55,326
Okay, can I start again?

1954
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:57,328
Please.

1955
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,592
Okay.

1956
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:01,680
Yeah.

1957
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,377
Yeah, okay, that's good.

1958
01:05:03,464 --> 01:05:04,509
Fuck me.

1959
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:05,510
Fuck me hard.

1960
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:06,728
Fuck me hard!

1961
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,948
Fuck me harder than hard.

1962
01:05:09,035 --> 01:05:09,775
Yeah!

1963
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:10,863
Fuck me hard.

1964
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,169
Fuck me hard, hard, hard.

1965
01:05:12,256 --> 01:05:14,649
Fu... harder...

1966
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:16,608
that was good.

1967
01:05:16,695 --> 01:05:17,435
Maybe I should hold

1968
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:18,349
the camera.

1969
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:19,959
Yeah, good idea.

1970
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:21,874
Here, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1971
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:24,790
Okay.

1972
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:25,791
What's wrong?

1973
01:05:25,878 --> 01:05:26,879
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

1974
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:27,793
What?

1975
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,620
What do you hear?

1976
01:05:28,707 --> 01:05:29,577
Is it your ex?

1977
01:05:29,664 --> 01:05:30,535
Oh, don't be so jumpy.

1978
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:31,318
I'm going over my lines

1979
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:32,145
in my head.

1980
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:32,754
Your lines?

1981
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:33,581
You have lines?

1982
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:36,715
Okay, okay.

1983
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:38,978
Oh.

1984
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:41,546
Oh, god, that's right.

1985
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,461
That's the spot.

1986
01:05:43,548 --> 01:05:45,463
That's the spot.

1987
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:46,812
That feels so good.

1988
01:05:46,899 --> 01:05:48,379
That feels so good.

1989
01:05:48,466 --> 01:05:49,510
God, I like it

1990
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:50,685
when you fuck me like that.

1991
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:51,817
Do you know how much I like it

1992
01:05:51,904 --> 01:05:52,557
when you fuck me like that?

1993
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:55,038
Feels so good.

1994
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:57,910
Uh, is that real,

1995
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,564
or are those your lines?

1996
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:00,913
Pretty good, aren't I?

1997
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,914
Oh.

1998
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:03,046
Come on, gimme this.

1999
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:03,916
I thought I was holding

2000
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,048
the camera.

2001
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:05,918
No, no, I need you to hold

2002
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,398
the prop.

2003
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:08,834
Here.

2004
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:11,228
Okay, turn it on.

2005
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:14,274
Oh, my god, that is loud.

2006
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:16,755
Oh, yeah.

2007
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:18,496
Oh, oh, that feels good.

2008
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,323
That is, like,

2009
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,672
lawn mower loud.

2010
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:23,066
Oh, it's working.

2011
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:24,154
If it wasn't working,

2012
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:25,329
I would be very concerned.

2013
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,766
Oh, just move it slow, slow,

2014
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:28,767
slow, slow, slow, slow!

2015
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:29,898
Slow.

2016
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,074
When you've used this before,

2017
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:31,857
have the neighbors ever called

2018
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:32,858
to complain?

2019
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:33,685
Okay, you know what?

2020
01:06:33,772 --> 01:06:36,079
You hold this.

2021
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,995
Hang on.

2022
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:41,780
Whoa.

2023
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:43,173
Mm-hmm.

2024
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,610
That's right.

2025
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:55,228
Here, come on.

2026
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:55,968
Uh, you got lube on your

2027
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:56,925
hands.

2028
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,101
You might not want to...

2029
01:06:58,188 --> 01:06:59,189
okay, I want you to focus on

2030
01:06:59,276 --> 01:07:00,886
the sex, and I will focus

2031
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:02,061
on the tape.

2032
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:03,193
Okay, I'm just saying,

2033
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,020
you might want to use two hands.

2034
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:05,108
I know.

2035
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:05,891
You think I'm not capable

2036
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:06,718
of holding on...

2037
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:08,459
oh, fuck me!

2038
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:09,286
Oh, yeah, there it is.

2039
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:10,461
Fuck me!

2040
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:12,854
I knew you had it in you.

2041
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:13,812
Oh, god.

2042
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:14,552
Oh, god, I've got to get

2043
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:15,988
some ice.

2044
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:16,989
What?

2045
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:17,816
Sweetie, your nose

2046
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:19,122
is bleeding.

2047
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:20,297
Oh, shit.

2048
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:22,995
I'm okay.

2049
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:24,649
I'm okay.

2050
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,346
I'm... i'm sorry.

2051
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:28,000
I'm trying too hard.

2052
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:30,089
Just...

2053
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:37,531
I should get you some ice.

2054
01:07:37,618 --> 01:07:41,144
Wait.

2055
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:45,061
Not yet.

2056
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,888
Not yet.

2057
01:07:46,975 --> 01:07:48,020
That's the sexiest thing you've

2058
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:49,021
said all day.

2059
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:10,086
Mm, mm.

2060
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,306
Mm?

2061
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:32,891
Oh.

2062
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:33,718
Mm-hmm.

2063
01:08:33,805 --> 01:08:35,067
Mmm.

2064
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:37,069
Mmm.

2065
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:38,026
Morning.

2066
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,072
Mmm, good morning.

2067
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:41,204
You remembered.

2068
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:43,380
Yeah, mm-hmm.

2069
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:49,386
Baby?

2070
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:50,561
Mm-hmm?

2071
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:51,997
Did you eat a shit sandwich

2072
01:08:52,084 --> 01:08:52,998
last night?

2073
01:08:53,085 --> 01:08:54,086
Oh, my god, really?

2074
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:55,218
Is it really bad?

2075
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:56,306
Well, your breath tastes like

2076
01:08:56,393 --> 01:08:57,176
dog poo.

2077
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:58,308
Is that bad?

2078
01:08:58,395 --> 01:08:59,396
Well, then don't kiss me.

2079
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:00,484
Oh, no, no, I didn't say

2080
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:01,267
I didn't want to kiss you.

2081
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:02,007
I'm so gross.

2082
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:04,488
Okay, I don't want

2083
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:05,228
to kiss you.

2084
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:06,185
I'm gonna hurl.

2085
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:07,752
Way to kill the mood.

2086
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:08,927
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2087
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:10,058
Where are you going?

2088
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,234
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

2089
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:12,409
Oh, no, it'll take too long.

2090
01:09:12,496 --> 01:09:13,584
Honey, I got to pee.

2091
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:14,454
Well, you should've thought

2092
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:15,586
of that before.

2093
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:16,935
Do you want me to pee on you?

2094
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:18,241
Yeah, now you're talking.

2095
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:19,590
Seriously, I got to go.

2096
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:21,418
Sexy nose strips by the way.

2097
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:24,116
Hey, I wear these things

2098
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,204
for you.

2099
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,657
Hey, are you starting

2100
01:09:43,744 --> 01:09:44,832
without me?

2101
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:47,531
It's my toothbrush, asshole.

2102
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:51,012
Hey, come on, honey.

2103
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:52,100
I've been waiting all night.

2104
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:52,927
Well, you can wait a few

2105
01:09:53,014 --> 01:09:54,799
more minutes.

2106
01:09:54,886 --> 01:09:58,281
I have to go back to sleep.

2107
01:09:58,368 --> 01:10:00,326
God help you if I start reading

2108
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:02,285
this book again.

2109
01:10:02,372 --> 01:10:04,200
Iincoln just freed the slaves.

2110
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,157
It's starting to get good.

2111
01:10:06,071 --> 01:10:06,898
You ready?

2112
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:07,725
Yeah, I'm ready.

2113
01:10:07,812 --> 01:10:08,682
I'm ready.

2114
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:09,466
I'm about to send in

2115
01:10:09,553 --> 01:10:14,993
a search party.

2116
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,647
Wow.

2117
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:17,822
I stashed it in the bathroom

2118
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:19,650
last night.

2119
01:10:19,737 --> 01:10:20,651
I figured, you know, since

2120
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:23,001
it's been a while...

2121
01:10:23,088 --> 01:10:24,742
it's about to go a lot faster

2122
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:25,917
now.

2123
01:10:26,004 --> 01:10:27,005
Ooh, don't threaten me with

2124
01:10:27,092 --> 01:10:27,919
a good time.

2125
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:33,272
Oh, my god.

2126
01:10:37,624 --> 01:10:38,364
Honey?

2127
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:39,931
Yeah?

2128
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:42,281
I definitely want to add

2129
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:43,413
this to our chore wheel.

2130
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:09,047
We never made it to yellow.

2131
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:11,571
Hmm, next time.

2132
01:11:11,658 --> 01:11:12,703
I mean, if there's a next time.

2133
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:13,878
No pressure.

2134
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:16,359
No, no, I'd like that.

2135
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:19,362
Great, I look forward to it.

2136
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:23,931
Me too.

2137
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:26,804
I can't feel my feet.

2138
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:28,109
I'm sorry if I'm squishing

2139
01:11:28,196 --> 01:11:30,329
you or anything.

2140
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:35,421
What?

2141
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:36,292
What is it?

2142
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:38,294
What?

2143
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:39,599
The condom.

2144
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:41,906
Did it break?

2145
01:11:41,993 --> 01:11:42,907
I don't know.

2146
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:44,038
It's not here.

2147
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:45,301
What do you mean, "not here"?

2148
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:48,260
I... I mean, I think

2149
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:49,392
it fell off.

2150
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:50,915
No, no-no-no, don't say that.

2151
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:51,742
Don't say that.

2152
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:52,569
Don't tell me.

2153
01:11:52,656 --> 01:11:53,396
Don't say that.

2154
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:54,266
It's not here.

2155
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:55,963
Fuck.

2156
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:56,790
I'm sorry.

2157
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:57,922
I fell asleep.

2158
01:11:58,009 --> 01:11:59,184
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

2159
01:11:59,271 --> 01:12:00,751
Do you want me to, uh,

2160
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:01,969
help you look for it?

2161
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:02,970
Oh, the bathroom?

2162
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:03,928
Right there.

2163
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:04,972
Okay.

2164
01:12:05,059 --> 01:12:05,886
Uh...

2165
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:07,148
oh, fuck, fuck.

2166
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:09,760
Oh... um...

2167
01:12:09,847 --> 01:12:11,979
it...

2168
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:15,287
well, is it in there?

2169
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:16,854
Fuck.

2170
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:17,768
Is that a yes?

2171
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:18,856
It's slippery.

2172
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,813
I can't get a hold of it.

2173
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:20,597
Oh, that is not good.

2174
01:12:20,684 --> 01:12:22,947
Um... um...

2175
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:23,774
do you want me to get you

2176
01:12:23,861 --> 01:12:26,951
some... tweezers?

2177
01:12:27,038 --> 01:12:30,258
Or, uh...

2178
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:40,617
oh, this is bad, isn't it?

2179
01:12:40,704 --> 01:12:44,534
It's not good.

2180
01:12:44,621 --> 01:12:49,234
Are you on the pill?

2181
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:50,148
It's really hard to get

2182
01:12:50,235 --> 01:12:51,062
pregnant.

2183
01:12:51,149 --> 01:12:52,063
It is, isn't it?

2184
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,194
I mean, really hard.

2185
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:53,978
Some people, they try for years,

2186
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:54,935
and they can't.

2187
01:12:55,022 --> 01:12:55,762
Right, it's hard.

2188
01:12:55,849 --> 01:12:56,415
So what are the chances,

2189
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:57,198
right?

2190
01:12:57,285 --> 01:12:58,025
Close to none.

2191
01:12:58,112 --> 01:12:59,636
Probably none.

2192
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:02,073
Yeah.

2193
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:06,991
Yeah.

2194
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:07,818
All right, well, I think

2195
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:09,472
I better go.

2196
01:13:09,559 --> 01:13:10,560
No, no, you know, you don't

2197
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:11,517
have to.

2198
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:12,475
Yeah, I should go.

2199
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:13,998
It's late.

2200
01:13:14,085 --> 01:13:17,001
Well, okay.

2201
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:18,176
I had a really, really

2202
01:13:18,263 --> 01:13:19,482
good time.

2203
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:21,092
Yeah, so did i.

2204
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:22,093
I'm really sorry I scared

2205
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,268
you that way.

2206
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:24,400
No, no, you didn't scare me.

2207
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:24,922
I'm the one who should apologize

2208
01:13:25,009 --> 01:13:25,749
to you.

2209
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:26,750
I'm sorry.

2210
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:28,273
It's fine, honestly.

2211
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,100
But I mean...

2212
01:13:29,187 --> 01:13:30,057
no, it's fine.

2213
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:30,971
Not a doubt in my mind.

2214
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:32,756
Really, it's fine.

2215
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:34,714
I'm sure of it.

2216
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,587
Okay.

2217
01:13:37,674 --> 01:13:38,936
Okay.

2218
01:13:39,023 --> 01:13:41,199
Well...

2219
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:49,512
bye.

2220
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:54,299
Bye.

2221
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:07,704
Hmm, you still want to?

2222
01:14:09,357 --> 01:14:13,405
Shh, go back to sleep.

2223
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:14,232
Come on.

2224
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:15,494
We can.

2225
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:17,583
Let's try it.

2226
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:20,456
Gently, huh?

2227
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,413
Baby, I don't want to make

2228
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,240
you do this.

2229
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:25,286
No, I want to.

2230
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:28,246
If it hurts, we'll stop.

2231
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,203
Okay?

2232
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,466
I'll get a condom.

2233
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:32,250
No, you don't need one.

2234
01:14:32,337 --> 01:14:33,251
I'm breast-feeding.

2235
01:14:33,338 --> 01:14:35,122
I can't get pregnant.

2236
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:35,949
You can't?

2237
01:14:36,036 --> 01:14:37,429
Yeah.

2238
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:48,266
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

2239
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:49,746
We can't do that.

2240
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:50,703
Haven't you ever heard

2241
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,009
of an air embolism?

2242
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:52,923
What?

2243
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,446
An air embolism.

2244
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:55,578
If air gets trapped in the

2245
01:14:55,665 --> 01:14:56,970
blood vessels, I could die.

2246
01:14:57,057 --> 01:14:58,058
But that's, like, just for

2247
01:14:58,145 --> 01:15:00,452
the first few days, right?

2248
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:01,279
Do you really want

2249
01:15:01,366 --> 01:15:02,106
to test it?

2250
01:15:04,195 --> 01:15:05,762
Come on, get back up here.

2251
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:09,461
Well, I mean, that's...

2252
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:10,462
what... what are you doing?

2253
01:15:12,856 --> 01:15:14,814
Yeah.

2254
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:15,772
I really, really, really

2255
01:15:15,859 --> 01:15:16,599
want to wait.

2256
01:15:16,686 --> 01:15:17,600
Why?

2257
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,558
Until you're ready.

2258
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:20,516
Well, I'm never gonna be

2259
01:15:20,603 --> 01:15:21,821
ready.

2260
01:15:21,908 --> 01:15:23,954
Oh.

2261
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,304
Look, honey, this isn't

2262
01:15:26,391 --> 01:15:27,479
so much about me needing

2263
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:28,306
to heal, okay.

2264
01:15:28,393 --> 01:15:30,700
I... I just...

2265
01:15:31,918 --> 01:15:32,789
when I look at what this did

2266
01:15:32,876 --> 01:15:34,573
to my body and my mind

2267
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,707
and my sanity, I just kind of...

2268
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:38,795
I don't know.

2269
01:15:38,882 --> 01:15:39,970
I'm freaking out a little,

2270
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:42,886
you know?

2271
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:43,713
Well, you know what

2272
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,323
they say.

2273
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,630
What do they say?

2274
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:48,500
Got to get back up

2275
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:49,893
on that horse.

2276
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,852
Oh, really, horse?

2277
01:15:52,939 --> 01:15:55,159
That's what they say.

2278
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:56,377
You think you're maybe

2279
01:15:56,464 --> 01:15:58,336
flattering yourself a little?

2280
01:15:58,423 --> 01:15:59,511
It's what they say.

2281
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:02,079
I'm just... i'm just repeating.

2282
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:05,822
Okay.

2283
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:07,345
No, you're right, though.

2284
01:16:07,432 --> 01:16:08,476
If we don't do it now,

2285
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,652
it's just gonna be twice as hard

2286
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:10,522
tomorrow.

2287
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:11,610
Yeah.

2288
01:16:11,697 --> 01:16:12,916
Think about it in a week.

2289
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:15,179
It'll be brutal.

2290
01:16:17,181 --> 01:16:21,228
Okay, come here, come here.

2291
01:16:26,103 --> 01:16:26,843
Hey, baby?

2292
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,627
Yeah?

2293
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:29,759
Thanks for loving me

2294
01:16:29,846 --> 01:16:34,111
even though I'm falling apart.

2295
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:35,242
I don't think I've ever loved

2296
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:36,766
you more than right now...

2297
01:16:36,853 --> 01:16:37,680
ooh.

2298
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:40,117
In this moment.

2299
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:41,248
Really?

2300
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:43,076
Yeah.

2301
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:45,165

2306
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:16,980
No, not at all.

2307
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:26,729
Are you okay?

2308
01:17:26,816 --> 01:17:28,600
Baby, does it still hurt?

2309
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:31,429
It's not that.

2310
01:17:31,516 --> 01:17:34,911
That's not why I'm crying.

2311
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:38,915

01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:42,832
No, I'm just... i'm happy.

You don't look happy.

01:17:44,616 --> 01:17:47,445
I am.

2315
01:17:47,532 --> 01:17:50,709
J.t., I'm... i'm not delusional.

01:17:53,364 --> 01:17:54,626
We have our whole lives ahead

2319
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:55,758
of us.

2320
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:57,760
And life, college,

2321
01:17:57,847 --> 01:17:58,848
and everything that's gonna

2322
01:17:58,935 --> 01:17:59,979
pull us apart.

2323
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:00,850
Hey, you don't know that.

2324
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:03,330
No, I know that.

2325
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:04,288
I know that as much as

2326
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,202
I know you're gonna eat

2327
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:05,942
another hamburger.

2328
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:06,769
I'm not.

2329
01:18:06,856 --> 01:18:07,683
Okay, I swear.

2330
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:11,121
Baby, it's fine.

2331
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:14,777
All I'm saying is...

2332
01:18:14,864 --> 01:18:18,868
I'm glad this was with you.

2333
01:18:18,955 --> 01:18:19,782
Tracey, what are you talking

2334
01:18:19,869 --> 01:18:20,870
about?

2335
01:18:20,957 --> 01:18:21,653
All right, you're starting

2336
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,959
to scare me.

2337
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:26,963
Just promise me

01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,878
that when you're married to

2339
01:18:28,965 --> 01:18:32,751
some lucky woman who isn't me,

2340
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:36,320
and you have three kids,

2341
01:18:36,407 --> 01:18:42,195

Baby, I'm gonna be with you.

01:18:54,642 --> 01:18:55,992
What's my husband gonna think

2347
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:58,516

2348
01:18:58,603 --> 01:18:59,735
Shut up, okay?

2349
01:18:59,822 --> 01:19:02,389
You're just being stupid.

2357

No, this is better

Really, that's the face you make

when I say that?

2364
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:40,210
No, no, I'm leaking.

2365
01:19:40,297 --> 01:19:41,820
Oh, no, that's normal.

2366
01:19:41,907 --> 01:19:43,430
All we need is one

2367
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:46,259
motivated sperm.

2368
01:19:46,346 --> 01:19:47,565
It's good.

2369
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:48,740
Men are messy.

2370
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:51,569
I don't know how women do it.

2371
01:19:51,656 --> 01:19:54,441
15 more minutes, okay?

2372
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:56,530
Okay.

2373
01:19:58,532 --> 01:20:01,448
What do you think of sam?

2374
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,754
For a boy or a girl?

2375
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:06,236
Either, samantha or samuel.

2376
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:08,891
Mmm, I don't think so.

2377
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:10,849
My top three boy names are

2378
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:16,159
brandon, stuart, and gregory.

2379
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:18,857
Well, samuel's in my top

2380
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,815
three.

2381
01:20:19,902 --> 01:20:21,512
Nah, I don't think so.

2382
01:20:21,599 --> 01:20:22,861
What gives you a say in

2383
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:24,776
my top three?

2384
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:27,083
Taste.

2385
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,912
Okay, baby.

2386
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:33,872
What about girls?

2387
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:41,271
So, mom, dad...

2388
01:20:41,358 --> 01:20:45,928
I wanted you both to know that

2389
01:20:46,015 --> 01:20:48,800
I'm pregnant.

2390
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:49,801
Pregnant, how?

2391
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:50,628
I didn't know you had

2392
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:52,499
a boyfriend.

2393
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:54,110
Well, actually, I went to

2394
01:20:54,197 --> 01:20:57,809
a fertility clinic, and I got

2395
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:59,942
artificially inseminated.

2396
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:03,032
This cannot be happening.

2397
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:04,163
This cannot be happening.

2398
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,513
I am religious about that pill.

2399
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,820
I mean, I am a birth control

2400
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:09,647
junkie.

2401
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,391
That's a nice try.

2402
01:21:14,478 --> 01:21:16,219
Ah, that's funny.

2403
01:21:16,306 --> 01:21:17,829
Susan said that when she

2404
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,004
gave birth, the doctor told her

2405
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:20,527
to push so hard, she...

2406
01:21:20,614 --> 01:21:22,312
She just took a giant shit

2407
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:23,182
all over the delivery room

2408
01:21:23,269 --> 01:21:24,009
table.

2409
01:21:24,096 --> 01:21:24,880
Really?

2410
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:25,706
Yeah.

2411
01:21:25,793 --> 01:21:26,838
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

2412
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:27,708
Throughout my entire freshman

2413
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:28,840
year at college...

2414
01:21:28,927 --> 01:21:31,234
didn't mean I was pregnant.

2415
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:33,932
What is that?

2416
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:36,935
It's a tumor.

2417
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:37,849
No, it's not.

2418
01:21:37,936 --> 01:21:39,503
I know it's not.

2419
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,765
Is that blue?

2420
01:21:40,852 --> 01:21:41,940
No, it's not blue.

2421
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:43,028
It's not even a shade of blue.

2422
01:21:43,115 --> 01:21:45,030
It's more like a lavender.

2423
01:21:45,117 --> 01:21:46,336
But is it more blue than red?

2424
01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:48,164
Yes, it's more blue than red.

2425
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:50,688
Shit.

2426
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:52,342
I don't know your middle name

2427
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:53,778
or your favorite food

2428
01:21:53,865 --> 01:21:55,258
or your favorite book.

2429
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:56,346
I don't know what kind of

2430
01:21:56,433 --> 01:21:57,695
toothpaste you use.

2431
01:21:57,782 --> 01:21:58,914
Or do you surf?

2432
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:00,089
'Cause you... you're looking like

2433
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:01,786
a surfer, and I'm not.

2434
01:22:01,873 --> 01:22:03,396
Okay, you are clearly not

2435
01:22:03,483 --> 01:22:04,702
following me.

2436
01:22:04,789 --> 01:22:06,269
I am pregnant.

2437
01:22:06,356 --> 01:22:07,966
We are pregnant.

2438
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:11,535
Holy shit, how did this happen?

2439
01:22:11,622 --> 01:22:12,536
Maybe we should watch

2440
01:22:12,623 --> 01:22:14,538
the tape and find out.

2441
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:15,713
Gwen.

2442
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:16,670
Gwen, tell me

2443
01:22:16,757 --> 01:22:18,194
you're full of crap.

2444
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:19,369
That's right!

2445
01:22:19,456 --> 01:22:20,761
That's what I'm talking about!

2446
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:23,199
Yeah!

Uh, all right.

I think babies come from...

01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:23,824
I think babies come from

2471
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:25,609
the sky.

2472
01:23:25,696 --> 01:23:27,089
I know where babies come

2473
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:32,268
from, and it's mommy's vagina.

2474
01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:34,705
I think babies come from...

2475
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:39,971
vaginas.

2476
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:40,972
Why would you ask me

2477
01:23:41,059 --> 01:23:41,973
that question?

2478
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,105
Maybe they come from...

2479
01:23:43,192 --> 01:23:45,629
I don't know... like, an egg?

2480
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:47,283
I think babies come from

2481
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:48,980
mommy's stomach.

2482
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:51,548
I think they just appear.

2483
01:23:51,635 --> 01:23:53,158
They just grow.

2484
01:23:53,245 --> 01:23:54,812
They cut the belly,

2485
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:57,728
and then they take the baby out.

2486
01:23:57,815 --> 01:24:01,514
And then it starts to be

2487
01:24:01,601 --> 01:24:02,994
a brother.

2488
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:04,126
I think god puts them in

2489
01:24:04,213 --> 01:24:05,562
a mommy's tummy.

2490
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:07,303
And then they just swim around

2491
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,087
in the water that she's drunk.

2492
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:11,220
So first the baby is in

2493
01:24:11,307 --> 01:24:12,699
the mommy's belly.

2494
01:24:12,786 --> 01:24:13,744
Then she has to go to

2495
01:24:13,831 --> 01:24:14,832
the bathroom.

2496
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:17,008
She poops the baby out,

2497
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:20,403
and that's why we always stink.

2498
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:24,363
The doctor opens up

2499
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:27,192
the zipper, and then their baby

2500
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:28,280
comes out, and then

2501
01:24:28,367 --> 01:24:30,500
they sew it back together.

2502
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:31,414
And then when the baby's

2503
01:24:31,501 --> 01:24:32,589
tired of swimming,

2504
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:34,721
the doctor just tickles the

2505
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:37,028
mommy as much as he can until

2506
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:39,117
the baby just pops right out.

2507
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:40,858
I saw on the computer

2508
01:24:40,945 --> 01:24:42,686
a dog having a baby.

2509
01:24:42,773 --> 01:24:45,558
And... and it doesn't come out

2510
01:24:45,645 --> 01:24:46,864
the dookie hole.

2511
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:48,039
I think it comes out of

2512
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:49,171
another hole.

2513
01:24:49,258 --> 01:24:51,042
And... and it's like poo,

2514
01:24:51,129 --> 01:24:52,870
like, uh!

2515
01:24:52,957 --> 01:24:55,394
Arr!

2516
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:58,571
They have sex.

2517
01:24:58,658 --> 01:25:02,706
That means that they make out...

2518
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:04,273
nude.

2519
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:12,237
Out of the booby booby,

2520
01:25:12,324 --> 01:25:14,935
hee-yow!

2521
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:15,893
Why are you taking a...

2522
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:16,894
who's bigger than us?

2523
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:17,634
When are you taking

2524
01:25:17,721 --> 01:25:18,635
the picture?

2525
01:25:18,722 --> 01:25:19,897
And... and we're not,

2526
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:21,028
and we're not...

2527
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:21,812
when are gonna take the...

2528
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:22,943
a baby anymore

2529
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:26,382
because we're big, big boys.

2530
01:25:26,469 --> 01:25:27,557
See?

2531
01:25:27,644 --> 01:25:28,384
Mark.

2532
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:29,254
I'll hold this.

2533
01:25:29,341 --> 01:25:30,125
I'll hold this.

2534
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:31,256
I'll hold it.

2535
01:25:31,343 --> 01:25:32,039
I'm just gonna put it right here

2536
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:32,779
