couldn't for the life of
me read the autocue

It was all blurred.

necessary for life to you .

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,251
You're Camille Logan.
Aren't you?

73
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:50,174
You're even more
Perfect in the flesh.

74
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,060
I'm so jealous.

75
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,334
Your life is like.. perfect

76
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:54,329
I literally love you.

77
00:06:54,353 --> 00:06:55,418
Thank You.

78
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:56,460
It's very sweet.

79
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm.

80
00:06:58,323 --> 00:06:59,368
I'm going to pay for these

81
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:03,756
and say that I can bought Camille Logan a drink .
-No, you don't have to.

82
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,594
She said "A lively one".

83
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,738
Love the material!

84
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Fab, isn’t it?

85
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:15,118
-"I’m thinking clinched-in waist—”
-“Full skirt.”

86
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:16,236
Yes! Yes!

87
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,380
I'll get a drawing over to
you by the end of the week.

88
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:21,451
-It’s short.

89
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:24,450
'The Paps' will have a
field day with that.

90
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
He's gone.

91
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Now.

92
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,317
“Fancy a trip to Harvey Nic’s?”

93
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:40,830
I can't.

94
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,186
“I’ve been summoned by my father.”

95
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,231
How careless of me.

96
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:58,334
Are you all right?

97
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,130
Take your time.

98
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:26,840
I have a three o’clock
appointment with Mr. Logan.

99
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,630
Jake Sharp.

100
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,130
Afternoon.

101
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,670
Take a seat, Sharp.

102
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,040
Your reputation is impressive.

103
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
I never fail.

104
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,950
-You received the down payment?
-Yes.

105
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,860
Everything you need to know
about Camille is in that file.

106
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,670
My daughter is
very precious to me.

107
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,310
Your job is to protect her.

108
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,901
What does your daughter
need protecting from, Mr. Logan?.

109
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,130
Has there been a threat?

110
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:31,800
Threats are part of the job.

111
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,170
Grunt give him the flaming
fire for crying out loud.

112
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,140
Your services
are a precautionary measure.

113
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,600
You're going to have to
give me a bit more on that.

114
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:06,840
That arrived via courier yesterday,

115
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:08,030
The demand for money.

116
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:08,910
-Anything?
-No.

117
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:10,200
Nothing.

118
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,950
So they just
want to scare you.

119
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,078
Many people want
to scare me. Mr. Sharp.

120
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:17,768
I'd rather just take your money.

121
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,278
Everyone's motivation is....

122
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:23,548
...different.

123
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:24,988
I look into it.

124
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,978
I assume you want to know who
has been making these threats

125
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,218
against your daughter's life.

126
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:32,608
Of course.

127
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,658
Camille's do momentarily.

128
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:38,795
Perhaps, it's best
If you're not here.

129
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,224
When I tell her what's happening?

130
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:41,988
-You haven't told her?
-She can be fiery.

131
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,672
She’s out there unprotected?

132
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:45,468
I wanted everything in place first.

133
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,070
You have a half hour.

134
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:03,588
My little star !

135
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,178
Give me a hug!

136
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,098
What’s up?

137
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,712
Nothing, Sweetheart.

138
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:13,168
Take a seat.

139
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,998
You're looking
particularly beautiful today.

140
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:23,748
I'm so proud of
you sweetheart.

141
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:28,818
And I’d do anything
to ensure your safety.

142
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,275
Dad, I’m not—

143
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,958
I received a message yesterday.

144
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:35,968
A threatening one.

145
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:38,338
Threatening you.

146
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:41,088
It’s just idle threats,
I’m sure.

147
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:46,608
But I’ve taken precautionary
measures, nevertheless.

148
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:51,228
I can’t be too careful
with my little star, can I?

149
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:54,811
Okay.

150
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:56,587
Good girl.

151
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:58,498
Get him in.

152
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Jake Sharp,

153
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:28,384
Good to go?

154
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:30,988
Look after her.

155
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:32,398
She’s in safe hands.

156
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,749
What do you mean?

157
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:36,588
[Stumbling]

158
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:37,968
Look after her?

159
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:39,178
Careful now.

160
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,598
Sharp is your bodyguard.

161
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:46,253
What?

162
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:47,278
Bodyguard?

163
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,808
Yes.

164
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:51,058
No.

165
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:52,998
No offense.

166
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,023
None taken.

167
00:12:58,008 --> 00:12:59,268
I have a busy schedule.

168
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,428
Modeling contracts to fulfill,

169
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:02,457
Meetings to attend.

170
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,968
Do you mean looking
pretty in front of the camera?

171
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,488
And negotiating a deal
on my new fashion line.

172
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:13,141
I doubt Mr. Sharp will appreciate having to
endure the simplicities of my pointless career.

173
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,248
I endure what I need to.

174
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:21,348
I don't want or need a bodyguard
following me around randomly.

175
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:22,373
It won’t be random,

176
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:24,018
It'll be constant.

177
00:13:24,228 --> 00:13:25,248
Twenty-four/seven.

178
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:27,318
Camille Logan, this isn’t
up for debate.

179
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,228
Sharp will protect you.

180
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,168
And you will not
be difficult about it.

181
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:35,992
[phone vibrating]

182
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:39,282
Sebastian is back in town.

183
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,184
You don't know me at all.

184
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:52,258
Do You?

185
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:11,353
The little…

186
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:30,171
Ready or not, here I come.

187
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:42,438
I’m not agreeing to you tailing me.

188
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:44,188
I have a life,

189
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,041
and I want to get
on with it.

190
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,468
Agree or not,
You and I are going to be very close.

191
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:50,467
Don't worry.

192
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:51,521
I don’t bite.

193
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:55,044
Maybe I do.

194
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,264
I've been told I taste good.

195
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,708
There is no threat,
 is there?

196
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:08,126
My ex-boyfriend is back in town, and that’s
the reason my dear father hired you.

197
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,468
The threat is very real, Miss Logan.

198
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:13,188
I’ve not been employed to keep
you away from your ex-boyfriend.

199
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:20,695
Oh my...

200
00:15:22,378 --> 00:15:24,178
I thought you were
going to do a runner again.

201
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,117
Since it seems like
I'm going to be stuck with you,

202
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:33,659
let's get a
few things straight.

203
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:35,428
Don't talk to me.

204
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,468
Don't touch me.

205
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:39,768
I'm going to pass by you know.

206
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:58,078
This is ridiculous.

207
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:01,885
Thought you’d call pronto,

208
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,018
What happened with your dad?

209
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,448
He hired a bodyguard for me.

210
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,108
Apparently there’s
been some sort of threat.

211
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,078
Now Seb’s out of
rehab, I’m suspicious.

212
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:14,988
I'm at Picasso’s.

213
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:16,458
Fancy, a glass of fizz?

214
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:17,959
Yes.

215
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:18,917
What the...

216
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,448
This door
should be locked.

217
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:23,242
You’re not coming in my car.

218
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,101
Not Today.

219
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:26,608
No, but once we’ve sorted the logistics,
you’ll be travelling with me...

220
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:27,718
in my car.

221
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:30,418
I’ll follow you home.

222
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,049
I’m not…

223
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:35,073
Fine.

224
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:39,337
Bastard.

225
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:51,658
Maybe you...

226
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,124
You ever pull a
stunt like that again,

227
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:49,722
then I’ll…

228
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:52,407
You’ll what?

229
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:55,471
I’ll put you over my knee...

230
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,738
And spank your
fucking arse bright red.

231
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,833
You’ll...

232
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:01,858
 spank me?

233
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:04,114
It's just a...

234
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,139
Figure of speech.

235
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,510
A rather inappropriate
one, don’t you think?

236
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:13,306
Yes.

237
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:24,628
Is that him?

238
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,519
The bodyguard?

239
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:28,408
Yes.

240
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:30,843
He's...

241
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:31,552
Gorgeous.

242
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,748
He’s a twat.

243
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:34,548
A fit twat.

244
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:37,168
Don’t tell me you haven’t
thought about him in bed.

245
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,007
Change the subject.

246
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:41,128
Saffron saw Sebastian.

247
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:42,477
Is he clean?

248
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:45,794
Saffron said his eyes were clear and his
body not as strung as it always used to be.

249
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:46,504
But...

250
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:47,494
Who knows?

251
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:49,928
So...

252
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,838
Where’s he sleeping?

253
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:54,051
Good question.

254
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:00,842
I'm sleeping here...

255
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:01,948
in case you're wondering.

256
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:04,886
This is a violation
of my human rights.

257
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,497
Take it up with your
father. I have my orders.

258
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:08,928
I’m ordering you to leave me alone.

259
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,418
You’re not paying
me, Miss Logan.

260
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,488
You do everything
my father tells you to?

261
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:16,768
Within reason.

262
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,554
For fuck...

263
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:28,373
Hey, Camille...

264
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:30,198
this door is very pretty.

265
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,628
Would be a shame to damage it.

266
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:35,588
We can do this the
easy way or the hard way.

267
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,003
Sebastian Peters is back in town

268
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:53,246
He nearly broke her.

269
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,038
Keep your eye
out for him as well.

270
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,455
I don't want that shit anywhere
near my daughter again.

271
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:24,316
(recalling)
You're job is to protect her.

272
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,392
I don’t think Logan is
giving us all the information.

273
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,426
The threat came printed on
paper that came fresh out of a ream.

274
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,616
He said it arrived
yesterday by courier.

275
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:41,806
Check out the CCTV
at Logan Tower.

276
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:43,256
I’m on it.

277
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:45,045
I’ve checked Logan’s e-mails...

278
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,216
Nothing suspicious.

279
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:47,726
How's it going?

280
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:49,676
Don't ask.

281
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:51,236
You women are difficult.

282
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,716
Get me everything
on Sebastian Peters.

283
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:00,072
[Door Opening]

284
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:02,352
[Camille Laughing]

285
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:05,996
Why do you have a gun?

286
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,177
To shoot you when
you piss me off again.

287
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:09,616
You’re a charmer, aren’t you?”

288
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:23,006
You can sleep here.

289
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,616
I’ll clear it.

290
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
Fine.

291
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:35,442
Get a good look, did you?

292
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:40,346
Do you always sleep
half-naked on a client’s couch?

293
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:42,380
Judging me and have
been falling downstairs?

294
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:57,549
[Camille grunting]

295
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,572
Move.

296
00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:30,597
No.

297
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,101
I have an eleven o'clock
meeting with my agent.

298
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,669
 I don't have time for this.

299
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:35,846
Then I suggest...

300
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:37,620
You stop being difficult...

301
00:24:37,658 --> 00:24:38,696
and get in.

302
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,416
Hi Kerry.

303
00:25:00,522 --> 00:25:01,555
Oh, Hello darling.

304
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:04,006
Daddy’s been
upsetting people again.

305
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:08,276
Good old Daddy.

306
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:13,676
What have you got for us?

307
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:16,441
Ok. Look Camille...

308
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:18,688
This investor wants
to work with you.

309
00:25:18,712 --> 00:25:19,404
They really do.

310
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:20,471
They...

311
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:25,003
love the idea of you fronting the
campaign, and a business idea.

312
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:26,276
But...

313
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,546
you don’t get a
say in the designs.

314
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:30,716
Or the fabrics.

315
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:32,656
Or the accessories.

316
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:36,346
So basically they want
to use my face and body...

317
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,730
To sell the clothes.
With our names

318
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:41,306
But we have no input on...

319
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:42,596
Anything.

320
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:43,881
Well with...

321
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:44,966
your name.

322
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:46,316
Certainly.

323
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,224
I mean...

324
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:50,216
They are offering
great money, Camille.

325
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,736
Kerry, it'll be no different
from modeling.

326
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:58,726
And they want me to ditch
my best friend and partner?

327
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,470
No.

328
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:04,606
Yes, well.

329
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:06,436
Take a look at the offer.

330
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:10,131
They don't want me...

331
00:26:10,156 --> 00:26:11,312
We’re a package deal.

332
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:13,397
This isn't happening
unless we're both involved.

333
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:14,555
Do you really mean that?

334
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,579
Yes.

335
00:26:16,128 --> 00:26:16,741
Heather,

336
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:18,496
You’re a genius dressmaker.

337
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:21,500
I wouldn’t want to work
with anyone else but you.

338
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:33,511
Wait here.

339
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:45,568
White van, Didn’t catch the
plates or a face. Could be nothing.

340
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:49,282
It was just parked
on the street.

341
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:51,146
Made a speedy getaway.

342
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:53,511
So would I, if I saw
you prowling toward me.

343
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:57,259
What are you doing around here?

344
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,019
Hey!

345
00:27:01,472 --> 00:27:03,381
Just on my way to meet
Dad at his lawyer’s office.

346
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:04,974
Who’s suing him now?

347
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,263
The fucking world!

348
00:27:06,736 --> 00:27:07,426
How's tricks?

349
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:08,696
Fine.

350
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:11,324
I thought you got a killing
machine tailing you, too.

351
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:15,656
This is my brother, TJ.

352
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:17,647
So this is the famous
killing machine, eh?

353
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,676
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sharp.

354
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:20,644
And you.

355
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:23,241
I hear...

356
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,366
A certain someone
is out of rehab.

357
00:27:25,756 --> 00:27:27,431
Funny, the day
Sebastian's released...

358
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:29,392
Sharp is hired to protect me.

359
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,478
I saw the threat...

360
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,031
Can’t be too careful with
our little star?

361
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:34,858
What did it say?

362
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:36,347
Who sent it?

363
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:38,054
What it said doesn't matter.

364
00:27:38,501 --> 00:27:39,718
If we knew who sent it...

365
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,443
don’t you think something would be done
about it?

366
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,626
Look after our girl.

367
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:48,741
-Bye.
-Bye.

368
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:20,705
Any news on the courier.

369
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:22,666
There was no courier that day.

370
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:24,297
He's hiding something.

371
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:25,946
Let’s ask him.

372
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:27,776
No.

373
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:30,339
Don’t give him any reason
to believe we’re on his case.

374
00:28:30,616 --> 00:28:31,616
Keep digging.

375
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,516
I'm going to try these on.

376
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:58,376
Take your time.

377
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:00,836
Sweet.

378
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:11,936
Use the closest cubicle.

379
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:13,874
I prefer the one of the back

380
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:15,396
Don't think I will
go back there.

381
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:17,992
Don’t think I care.

382
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:18,721
Camille...

383
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:19,890
Just use this one.

384
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:36,216
These are a yes.

385
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:55,229
Another yes.

386
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,610
I’ll be outside.

387
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,885
They’re a yes!

388
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:13,346
Hi.

389
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:20,612
Perfume?

390
00:30:58,702 --> 00:30:59,702
Jake?

391
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:05,224
Beta-blockers...

392
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:06,249
They stop adrenaline.

393
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,923
They control anxiety.

394
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:15,757
Don't feel sorry for me.

395
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:22,105
Why?

396
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:26,035
I don’t deserve it.

397
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,485
What happened to you?

398
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:37,253
War.

399
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:54,884
Hi.

400
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:56,864
Thank you.

401
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:06,334
What’s up?

402
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:12,588
Who delivered this?

403
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:20,361
I'm sending something to by courier.

404
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:21,647
Have it checked for fingerprints.

405
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:26,717
How serious is this threat.

406
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:32,324
Threats are normally just that...

407
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:33,349
Threats.

408
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:36,293
Don't worry.

409
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:38,068
I'll keep you safe.

410
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:00,846
I see you found your way
to the guess room.

411
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:05,954
Going somewhere?

412
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:06,634
Yes.

413
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:07,937
Have been reassigned.

414
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:09,574
Someone else is on
their way to take over.

415
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:11,570
Fine.

416
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:14,922
Is Camille home?

417
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:20,367
Sebastian.

418
00:34:21,337 --> 00:34:22,375
What are you doing here?

419
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:23,858
How are you, Cam?

420
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,964
He works for my father.

421
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,584
Coffee?

422
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:33,283
I don't think so.

423
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:34,844
Come on.

424
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:36,344
Haven’t you missed me?

425
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:39,604
Your contact with
Miss Logan stops now.

426
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:44,551
I thought you were leaving.

427
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:45,944
Change of plan.

428
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,060
-What the fuck do you want?
-Jake!

429
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:18,658
Stay back!

430
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:19,568
He’s paparazzi!

431
00:35:19,594 --> 00:35:20,376
He wants a photograph.

432
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,390
He doesn't want to hurt me.

433
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:23,414
-Stan, Hi.
-Hi, Camille.

434
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:26,464
Mind asking this nice
gentleman if he’ll let me go?

435
00:35:26,642 --> 00:35:27,424
Yes, I do mind.

436
00:35:27,448 --> 00:35:28,602
I’ve known him for years.

437
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,914
He's one of the good guys.

438
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:32,322
Get outta here.

439
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:37,842
I'll replace the cameras, Stan.

440
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:38,867
No, you fucking won’t.

441
00:35:45,456 --> 00:35:47,609
I love how protective of her you are.

442
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:49,743
Of course I am.

443
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:50,734
I'm paid to protect her.

444
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:54,210
Open your eyes, big man.

445
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:16,699
No.

446
00:36:20,056 --> 00:36:21,056
Jake.

447
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:25,534
Jake, I'm meeting my mother and brother
for dinner before Saffron's birthday party.

448
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:28,904
Jake?

449
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:36,344
Jake.

450
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:57,975
What the fuck?

451
00:36:58,523 --> 00:36:59,523
I'm...

452
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,264
Sorry I thought...

453
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:02,289
and...

454
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:07,444
Who's she?

455
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:08,624
None of your business.

456
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:12,954
I'm sorry.

457
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:18,694
I shouldn’t have pried.

458
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:23,445
She's an ex.

459
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:25,544
She's...

460
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:28,304
She's nothing.

461
00:37:50,594 --> 00:37:51,594
You should get that.

462
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:54,903
Sharp.

463
00:38:55,474 --> 00:38:58,774
There's no sign of a courier to Logan Towers
the afternoon the threat arrived.

464
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:00,314
There must be.

465
00:39:00,814 --> 00:39:02,749
Have you check the CCTV?

466
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,773
-The records?
-Yes.

467
00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:08,014
Then maybe it was
delivered by someone else.

468
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:10,407
Maybe...

469
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,974
I could be wrong.

470
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:15,407
I understand.

471
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:18,004
I’ll call with an update
as soon as I have one.

472
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:26,564
You look beautiful darling.

473
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:29,618
Little star.

474
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:33,559
See you soon.

475
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:41,284
I'm meeting Heather
at the Picturedrome.

476
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:44,042
Let's go.

477
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:19,672
I need to wee.

478
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:22,686
Want to watch?

479
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:30,574
There won't be
any danger in there.

480
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:32,985
Then you won't
mind if I check then.

481
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,919
Will you?

482
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:41,571
Just go.

483
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:43,695
And be quick.

484
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:56,812
Camille.

485
00:40:57,238 --> 00:40:58,804
You stupid bitch!

486
00:41:01,654 --> 00:41:03,194
You think I'm not
good enough for you.

487
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:05,721
Your mine.

488
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:17,115
There’s a Heckler VP9
aimed at your pretty little head.

489
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:20,283
It’s going to make a mess when
I blow your fucking brains out.

490
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:22,924
and I’m probably gonna spend
the rest of my fucking life in prison.

491
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,104
But, I'll go there happily...

492
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:27,081
Knowing that you'll be dead.

493
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,985
Please.

494
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:34,016
Jake.

495
00:41:43,992 --> 00:41:44,992
Jake.

496
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:46,922
Jake.

497
00:42:19,174 --> 00:42:20,700
How did you get your bullet wound?.

498
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:25,386
I was shot in combat.

499
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:30,428
You were in the army.

500
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:32,793
SAS.

501
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:34,226
I was a sniper.

502
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:40,027
And that's why you’re not in the services
anymore, because you were wounded?

503
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:42,743
Something like that.

504
00:42:45,383 --> 00:42:46,823
How did it happen?

505
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:51,835
Bad judgment.

506
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:59,674
It only happened a few
times when we were together.

507
00:43:01,214 --> 00:43:04,924
I wouldn’t care if it happened once
and he sacrificed his life in apology.

508
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:08,464
I’d find a way to bring him back
to life just so I could kill him again.

509
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:10,334
Don’t try to defend him.

510
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,080
I’m not telling you
to defend him.

511
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:14,105
and...

512
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,916
Telling you so don't
think I'm pathetic.

513
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:21,242
I don't think that.

514
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,244
So what do you think of me?

515
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:27,394
How do you see me Jake?

516
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,786
A weak little woman who needs
looking after? A spoiled little brat?

517
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:36,785
A materialistic, self-centered female with no
appreciation of what it’s like to go without?

518
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:37,482
No!

519
00:43:38,614 --> 00:43:39,634
Exactly the opposite!

520
00:43:41,482 --> 00:43:43,354
What happened tonight?

521
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,485
I beat the shit out of a man
who was assaulting you!

522
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:47,453
What do you think
I’m going to do?

523
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:49,595
Hold you in place while
he gets his aim right?

524
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:51,225
That wasn't the only reason!

525
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,343
You were somewhere else!

526
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:53,956
What happened to you?

527
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:55,054
None of your damn business!

528
00:43:57,604 --> 00:43:58,604
You are my client!

529
00:43:58,894 --> 00:43:59,894
I am your bodyguard!

530
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:00,705
That’s it!

531
00:44:00,729 --> 00:44:02,044
Stop trying to figure me out!

532
00:44:21,255 --> 00:44:22,255
We can’t do this.

533
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:25,046
It’s wrong.

534
00:44:26,295 --> 00:44:27,582
I’m your bodyguard.

535
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:30,214
Your father will make
sure that I never work again.

536
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:34,334
I need a purpose, Camille.

537
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:37,177
I need to work.

538
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:44,869
I understand.

539
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:58,316
I don’t want you to understand.

540
00:45:12,696 --> 00:45:13,696
So beautiful.

541
00:45:23,842 --> 00:45:24,882
Are you okay?

542
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:48,631
Hell, Camille.

543
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:25,609
Lick, Please.

544
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:28,681
Please.

545
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:44,028
You hear me?

546
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,350
Perfect.

547
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:22,878
Jake.

548
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:30,269
Go to sleep, Cami.

549
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:25,289
Come back to bed.

550
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:37,088
I’m no good for you, Camille.

551
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,202
I'm not staying here forever.

552
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,423
Going out for a
shoot, Tomorrow.

553
00:49:58,163 --> 00:49:59,513
Then we’re staying
here until then.

554
00:50:37,305 --> 00:50:38,634
-Hi.
-Hi.

555
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:41,075
It’s not so bad

556
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:43,529
Let’s get you some makeup

But does she know?

923
01:16:28,941 --> 01:16:30,949
Camille’s still out
there in danger, Luce.

924
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,360
I need to find out
what's going on.

925
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,640
Then we will.

926
01:16:45,006 --> 01:16:46,921
You look like a homeless stray!

927
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:49,714
Oh.

928
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:55,230
Camille!

929
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:58,130
Now, now, sweetie pie.

930
01:17:01,187 --> 01:17:03,895
Has this got anything
to do with that...

931
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,100
strapping man who was photographed
carrying you out of The Picturedrome?

932
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:12,240
Dad hired him as a bodyguard.

933
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:15,500
Dad received a threat.

934
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:17,550
He receives those
weekly, darling.

935
01:17:17,575 --> 01:17:19,062
No, This was directed to me.

936
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:20,087
Jake and I...

937
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:22,873
We got close,

938
01:17:22,898 --> 01:17:25,430
And now, Dad is doing
everything to keep us apart.

939
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,850
Why?

940
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,200
Because he is a
narcissistic control freak.

941
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:32,370
Why did you marry him?

942
01:17:36,516 --> 01:17:37,516
I was young.

943
01:17:38,915 --> 01:17:40,880
Plus TJ was just a boy,

944
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:43,977
his mother was gone.

945
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,230
Your father...

946
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:47,150
forced the poor girl back to Russia.

947
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,440
Someone needed to instill
some humanity into him...

948
01:17:52,161 --> 01:17:54,200
before he turned into
his father completely.

949
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:00,510
What am I going to do?

950
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:04,700
Well, before you do anything...

951
01:18:05,357 --> 01:18:06,690
you’re gonna clean yourself up.

952
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,680
I'll have some
clothes bought for you.

953
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,974
I’ll always find you, angel.

954
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:43,228
Does your father
know you’re here?

955
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:43,613
No!

956
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:44,413
I ran away.

957
01:18:44,438 --> 01:18:45,878
I thought you gave me.

958
01:18:45,903 --> 01:18:46,903
Never.

959
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:27,570
Camille.

960
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,680
Sweetie pie!

961
01:19:34,653 --> 01:19:35,946
Mum.

962
01:19:37,928 --> 01:19:38,753
Hi.

963
01:19:38,866 --> 01:19:41,370
Mum, this is Jake,

964
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,190
So you’re the man who has
been causing all this trouble?

965
01:19:44,566 --> 01:19:45,315
I’m trying not to.

966
01:19:45,339 --> 01:19:46,606
But her father
doesn't seem to keen.

967
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:49,730
You could be Prince Harry
and he still wouldn’t approve.

968
01:19:52,233 --> 01:19:53,793
Why don’t you get yourself
dressed, sweetie pie?

969
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,970
I’ll take Jake into the lounge.

970
01:19:57,022 --> 01:19:58,206
We’ll have tea.

971
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:03,987
Jake?

972
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:04,630
You okay?

973
01:20:05,483 --> 01:20:06,350
Jake, What’s the matter?

974
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,800
I...

975
01:20:11,227 --> 01:20:12,325
I love you.

976
01:20:16,965 --> 01:20:19,340
I love you so fucking much
and I need you to know that.

977
01:20:23,441 --> 01:20:24,541
I love you, too.

978
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,580
How did you get into my house?

979
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,070
Did you know that your ex-husband paid off
Cami’s ex-boyfriend and funded his rehab?

980
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:53,910
Does Camille know?

981
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:55,340
I haven’t told her yet.

982
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:57,621
There’s a lot I
need to figure out.

983
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:00,660
Like what?

984
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,360
Like the true threat
to your daughter.

985
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,180
Something wasn’t sitting right
from the day Logan hired me.

986
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:09,080
He kept information from me
and when I questioned him...

987
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,360
He pulled me from the protection.

988
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,930
I don’t think his disapproval of my
relationship with Cami is the only reason

989
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:15,930
that he wants me gone.

990
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,652
He’s hiding something, and
I intend to find out what it is.

991
01:21:23,162 --> 01:21:25,112
She’ll be safe
with me until then.

992
01:21:27,692 --> 01:21:28,712
I have no doubt.

993
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:15,512
My nearest neighbor
is fifteen miles away.

994
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:18,312
Sociable.

995
01:22:19,232 --> 01:22:21,122
I didn't have you down
as the farmer type..

996
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,999
So what about the
stables and the fields?

997
01:22:24,024 --> 01:22:25,838
It was the most isolated
place I could find.

998
01:22:26,669 --> 01:22:28,052
Why would you
need to be isolated?

999
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:32,522
Because I knew that one day I
would meet a beautiful Princess...

1000
01:22:33,813 --> 01:22:35,702
We needed protecting
from a wicked father.

1001
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,832
For tonight we forget
everything and be together.

1002
01:23:22,009 --> 01:23:23,192
I’m taking you out for dinner.

1003
01:23:24,785 --> 01:23:25,785
Where?

1004
01:23:26,385 --> 01:23:27,385
Let me worry about that.

1005
01:23:44,175 --> 01:23:45,175
Make yourself at home.

1006
01:23:47,224 --> 01:23:48,224
I love you.

1007
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:53,930
Snap!

1008
01:24:22,756 --> 01:24:23,756
Jake.

1009
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:30,916
Jake.

1010
01:24:40,262 --> 01:24:41,972
"Take this paper and
for the instructions."

1011
01:24:42,872 --> 01:24:43,922
"Head across the driveway."

1012
01:24:44,462 --> 01:24:46,652
"There’s a gap
between two oak trees."

1013
01:24:47,644 --> 01:24:50,552
"Follow the trail until you reach
the huge trunk of a fallen tree."

1014
01:24:51,392 --> 01:24:53,468

instruction is there."

"One day"

1017
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:26,762
"I’m going to fuck you
on this ancient tree trunk."

1018
01:25:29,555 --> 01:25:30,980
"Look to your right."

1019
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,780
"There’s a silver birch."

1020
01:25:33,152 --> 01:25:36,331
"Pass it and follow the new path
until you reach a red rosebush."

1021
01:25:37,339 --> 01:25:39,067
"You’ll find your
next instruction there."

1022
01:25:40,459 --> 01:25:41,459
"Watch the thorns."

1023
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,070
"Jake."

1024
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:47,259
"This place is my safe haven."

1025
01:25:48,619 --> 01:25:49,712
"Now it’s yours, too."

1026
01:25:50,462 --> 01:25:52,088
"Everything I have is yours."

1027
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:54,649
"I love you."

1028
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:57,272
"More than I ever imagined
I could love someone."

1029
01:25:59,012 --> 01:26:02,672

"Your Clothes."

1032
01:26:09,542 --> 01:26:10,542
"Take them off."

1033
01:26:11,424 --> 01:26:13,277
"Take everything off."

1034
01:26:14,221 --> 01:26:17,021
"There’s an opening past this
Acer tree that will lead you to me."

1035
01:26:17,527 --> 01:26:18,527
"Hurry."

1036
01:26:18,992 --> 01:26:19,992

you never work again!

I couldn’t give a fuck
if I never work again.

I know there is an e-mail file
you've been keeping from me

know I wasn’t looking for, angel.

I'm kind of seeing him tomorrow.

he wouldn't have got that

01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:19,319

1285
01:43:29,308 --> 01:43:30,489
Please sit.

1286
01:43:32,218 --> 01:43:33,218
Tea?

1287
01:43:41,646 --> 01:43:42,646
How have you been?

1288
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,660
Alive.

1289
01:43:46,328 --> 01:43:47,341
I can see that.

1290
01:43:49,258 --> 01:43:50,458
Why are you here, Jake?

1291
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:52,138
After all these years?

1292
01:43:57,148 --> 01:43:58,148
I met someone.

1293
01:43:58,694 --> 01:44:00,448
i can't move on
in my life with all these...

1294
01:44:00,988 --> 01:44:02,548
regrets hanging around my neck.

1295
01:44:04,888 --> 01:44:05,888
I love this woman.

1296
01:44:07,678 --> 01:44:08,683
I need to tell her...

1297
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:10,598
Everything there is
to know about me.

1298
01:44:11,461 --> 01:44:12,352
I can’t have a life

1299
01:44:12,635 --> 01:44:13,611
with her without that.

1300
01:44:13,636 --> 01:44:14,878
It would be a lie.

1301
01:44:15,084 --> 01:44:16,104
as long as you're okay.

1302
01:44:17,278 --> 01:44:19,490
As long as you have peace and
you can get on with your life, Jake.

1303
01:44:19,514 --> 01:44:23,111
I haven't been able to move on
with my life for four years, Abbie!

1304
01:44:23,135 --> 01:44:25,648
You’re not the only one who
couldn't get on with their life.

1305
01:44:25,918 --> 01:44:27,777
I’ve been raising your
daughter on my own.

1306
01:44:29,522 --> 01:44:30,958
I’m going to make things right.

1307
01:44:34,405 --> 01:44:35,405
Daddy?

1308
01:44:38,165 --> 01:44:39,448
Charlotte, darling.

1309
01:44:39,898 --> 01:44:42,203
I told you to stay in
your room and play.

1310
01:44:42,808 --> 01:44:44,638
But, he looks like my daddy.

1311
01:44:50,621 --> 01:44:51,898
There’s a lady at the door.

1312
01:44:55,677 --> 01:44:56,677
Cami.

1313
01:44:59,061 --> 01:44:59,636
Cami.

1314
01:45:01,392 --> 01:45:02,524
Stay away from me.

1315
01:45:02,554 --> 01:45:03,554
Please.

1316
01:46:17,861 --> 01:46:18,861
Shit.

1317
01:46:23,183 --> 01:46:24,042
Cami!

1318
01:46:24,105 --> 01:46:25,866
Stay away from me, Jake!

1319
01:46:26,053 --> 01:46:27,014
Just, let me explain.

1320
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:27,910
You've lied to me.

1321
01:46:27,935 --> 01:46:29,771
You're married.
You have a daughter.

1322
01:46:30,088 --> 01:46:31,243
I was married.

1323
01:46:31,267 --> 01:46:32,098
Not anymore.

1324
01:46:32,698 --> 01:46:34,169
She's dead, Camille.

1325
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:35,855
My wife is fucking dead.

1326
01:46:36,795 --> 01:46:37,444
That woman...

1327
01:46:38,008 --> 01:46:39,028
is my wife's sister.

1328
01:46:39,498 --> 01:46:40,888
I came back early from tour,

1329
01:46:41,216 --> 01:46:43,288
and I found my wife in
bed with my best friend.

1330
01:46:44,368 --> 01:46:45,154
I walked out.

1331
01:46:45,178 --> 01:46:45,778
My wife...

1332
01:46:46,438 --> 01:46:47,188
Came after me

1333
01:46:47,212 --> 01:46:49,078
She chased after me in her car.

1334
01:46:51,961 --> 01:46:52,961
The Bus...

1335
01:46:54,096 --> 01:46:55,096
Hit her.

1336
01:46:55,768 --> 01:46:56,768
She died.

1337
01:46:57,832 --> 01:46:58,832
Oh My God.

1338
01:46:59,477 --> 01:47:00,477
She had a child.

1339
01:47:01,228 --> 01:47:02,228
While I was on tour.

1340
01:47:02,328 --> 01:47:03,328
I told myself...

1341
01:47:03,688 --> 01:47:05,282
Child wasn't mine.

1342
01:47:05,306 --> 01:47:06,418
I went back to war.

1343
01:47:07,883 --> 01:47:10,271
I felt that was the
only thing that I left.

1344
01:47:10,741 --> 01:47:11,741
I lost,

1345
01:47:11,848 --> 01:47:13,198
All sense of respect...

1346
01:47:13,574 --> 01:47:14,665
For my own safety.

1347
01:47:15,581 --> 01:47:16,838
For the safety of others.

1348
01:47:17,492 --> 01:47:19,407
I didn't want to be alive anymore.

1349
01:47:19,588 --> 01:47:21,591
Being alive felt like a form of...

1350
01:47:21,616 --> 01:47:23,738
Continuous Torture.

1351
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:29,198
And then met you.

1352
01:47:29,845 --> 01:47:31,318
Why didn't you tell me?

1353
01:47:31,558 --> 01:47:35,108
I turned into a hateful,
bitter bastard, Camille.

1354
01:47:35,491 --> 01:47:36,491
My daughter...

1355
01:47:37,197 --> 01:47:38,488
She's better off without me.

1356
01:47:39,088 --> 01:47:40,658
I didn’t want to poison her

1357
01:47:40,908 --> 01:47:42,728
with my darkness.

1358
01:47:43,138 --> 01:47:43,678
Nothing...

1359
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:45,958
about the time that
we spent together...

1360
01:47:46,258 --> 01:47:47,258
has been a lie.

1361
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:57,550
Camille!

1362
01:48:10,759 --> 01:48:12,162
You have ten seconds to tell
me what you've been hiding

1363
01:48:12,186 --> 01:48:13,742
before I blow your fucking brains out.

1364
01:48:13,766 --> 01:48:16,076
-Whare's Cami?
 What have you done with her?

1365
01:48:16,092 --> 01:48:17,614
-She's been fucking taken!

1366
01:48:17,638 --> 01:48:18,998
Fucking talk.
-Alright.

1367
01:48:21,418 --> 01:48:22,938
They've been
blackmailing me for weeks.

1368
01:48:24,257 --> 01:48:26,229
Said they’d expose me if I didn’t pay!

1369
01:48:26,253 --> 01:48:26,908
-Expose you how?

1370
01:48:29,081 --> 01:48:30,081
Leave us.

1371
01:48:33,739 --> 01:48:34,814
They have photos of me.

1372
01:48:36,963 --> 01:48:38,428
-Of me and a girl.
-How old?

1373
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:39,578
-15.

1374
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:41,660
I didn't know I thought
she was at least 20.

1375
01:48:42,542 --> 01:48:43,204
You bastard.

1376
01:48:43,229 --> 01:48:44,708
This can’t get out!

1377
01:48:44,848 --> 01:48:47,428
You pulled me from Camille's
protection knowing she wasn’t safe!

1378
01:48:47,548 --> 01:48:48,841
What the fuck were you thinking?

1379
01:48:48,892 --> 01:48:49,648
You were digging!

1380
01:48:49,856 --> 01:48:52,042
I couldn't let you see
the real threat I received

1381
01:48:52,066 --> 01:48:54,621
because it talks about the
pictures of me and the girl.

1382
01:48:54,646 --> 01:48:56,758
Who could've known what
you're up to in your spare time?

1383
01:48:56,963 --> 01:48:57,988
Don't push me Logan.

1384
01:48:58,248 --> 01:48:59,248
In the safe.

1385
01:49:00,067 --> 01:49:00,568
Get them out.

1386
01:49:01,471 --> 01:49:02,471
Move!

1387
01:49:22,708 --> 01:49:23,098
Speak.

1388
01:49:23,638 --> 01:49:25,198
I just found this
image on the site.

1389
01:49:26,128 --> 01:49:27,598
See the Van.
See the face.

1390
01:49:28,926 --> 01:49:30,543
Run a face check.

1391
01:49:30,568 --> 01:49:31,568
Already done.

1392
01:49:31,708 --> 01:49:32,995
His name is Michael Scott.

1393
01:49:33,718 --> 01:49:36,638
He's been inside for drug
running, armed robbery,

1394
01:49:37,228 --> 01:49:37,738
And then...

1395
01:49:37,888 --> 01:49:38,458
rape.

1396
01:49:38,728 --> 01:49:42,658
Served his last sentence in Borstal and
was granted probation eight weeks ago.

1397
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:45,295
One of his parole
conditions is to check in

1398
01:49:45,319 --> 01:49:47,997
weekly with his parole
officer in Shoreditch.

1399
01:49:48,028 --> 01:49:49,078
Today’s check-in day.

1400
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:52,438
If he’s following his parole
conditions, he should be there now.

1401
01:49:52,798 --> 01:49:53,998
I'm sending you the address.

1402
01:49:57,251 --> 01:49:58,251
Do you know this man?

1403
01:49:58,823 --> 01:49:59,539
No.

1404
01:50:00,606 --> 01:50:01,878
I’ve never seen
him before. Who is he?

1405
01:50:02,008 --> 01:50:03,906
Someone hired this man
to take your daughter.

1406
01:50:05,218 --> 01:50:06,369
Pray she’s unharmed, Logan.

1407
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:10,804
Pray real hard.

1408
01:54:52,118 --> 01:54:53,984
I’ll always find you, angel.

1409
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,655
Okay I'm just
going to see the doctor.

1410
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,370
Gets some rest.

1411
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:49,550
I'll call you later.

1412
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:55,660
I have something.

1413
01:56:56,830 --> 01:56:57,160
Go on.

1414
01:56:57,670 --> 01:57:01,773
It seems that Scott shared
a cell with a Vladimir Sochinsky.

1415
01:57:01,798 --> 01:57:02,530
Sochinsky?

1416
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:04,780
That was the maiden
name of my first wife.

1417
01:57:05,290 --> 01:57:06,290
TJ's mother.

1418
01:57:07,057 --> 01:57:08,560
Vladimir was her brother.

1419
01:57:09,988 --> 01:57:10,988
Oh, you’re safe!

1420
01:57:11,549 --> 01:57:12,792
Jesus, Cami, I’ve been so worried.

1421
01:57:12,817 --> 01:57:13,725
Where have you been?

1422
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:14,950
How did you know
Cami was missing?

1423
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:16,382
Dad called me.

1424
01:57:16,406 --> 01:57:17,677
-Jake, Stop.
-Don’t you dare...

1425
01:57:17,701 --> 01:57:19,386
-Start throwing accusations around!
-No.

1426
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:21,070
TJ is loyal through and through!

1427
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:23,979
Forgive me, but I have little
faith in the integrity of your family.

1428
01:57:24,183 --> 01:57:25,183
What?

1429
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:26,110
Wha...

1430
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:28,886
Is someone suggesting
I’d kidnap my own sister

1431
01:57:28,911 --> 01:57:31,120
for a ransom from my own father?
-Because, The man that took her,

1432
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:32,740
shared a cell with your uncle.

1433
01:57:33,226 --> 01:57:33,856
-My uncle?

1434
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,760
He’s also been blackmailing your father.

1435
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:38,638
My mom tried to connect with me.

1436
01:57:38,662 --> 01:57:39,670
I told her I was fine.

1437
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:40,390
When was that?

1438
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:41,720
Maybe three months.

1439
01:57:41,751 --> 01:57:42,751
The first threat.

1440
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:44,210
Three months ago.

1441
01:57:49,516 --> 01:57:50,516
Unknown number.

1442
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:53,440
Not for long.

1443
01:57:54,963 --> 01:57:59,148
- "Pictures surface today of
Billionaire 'Trevor Logan' with a minor.

1444
01:57:59,172 --> 01:58:00,976
in a most
compromising position."

1445
01:58:01,007 --> 01:58:04,420
- "Vladimir Sochinsky and his
sister, first wife of Trevor Logan

1446
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:07,013

of kidnapping Camille Logan."

1447
01:58:07,038 --> 01:58:08,980
-"And still, No comment
from Camille Logan.

to launch later this year."

1453
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,900
I never imagined I could do this.

1454
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,600
You can do anything.

1455
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:37,970
Only because you’re here.

1456
01:59:11,428 --> 01:59:12,428
Go.

1457
01:59:22,295 --> 01:59:23,907
One or two, Mr. Piggles?

1458
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:25,790
Two?

1459
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:27,079
Greedy!

1460
01:59:31,005 --> 01:59:31,659
Hello.

1461
01:59:33,013 --> 01:59:34,700
Hi I am Jake.

1462
01:59:37,024 --> 01:59:38,302
I know who you are.

1463
01:59:38,438 --> 01:59:39,542
You’re my daddy.

1464
01:59:40,426 --> 01:59:41,786
Nice to meet you.

1465
01:59:44,152 --> 01:59:45,152
I am Charlotte.

1466
01:59:45,336 --> 01:59:46,754
Your little girl.

1467
01:59:46,803 --> 01:59:48,373
It's really nice to meet
you too, Charlotte.

1468
01:59:49,566 --> 01:59:50,412
Sit down.

1469
01:59:52,769 --> 01:59:53,769
What've we got here?

1470
01:59:54,225 --> 01:59:54,647
Tea.

1471
01:59:55,778 --> 01:59:56,330
What?

1472
01:59:56,497 --> 01:59:56,921
Tea.

1473
01:59:57,654 --> 01:59:58,774
We're having a party.

1474
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:16,918
It's good.

1475
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:21,627
Charlotte.

1476
02:00:23,486 --> 02:00:25,210
I’d like to show you a
photograph of your mummy.

1477
02:00:31,794 --> 02:00:32,794
What was she like?

1478
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:43,790
She was wonderful.

1479
02:00:44,978 --> 02:00:45,978
And...

1480
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:47,750
Beautiful.

1481
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:49,460
Just like you.

1482
02:00:54,362 --> 02:00:55,237
Daddy.

1483
02:00:55,249 --> 02:00:57,782
Have you finished
fighting the bad men now?

1484
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:00,051
What?

1485
02:01:00,165 --> 02:01:01,258
Aunty Abbie said...

1486
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:04,505
Maybe one day you
could come home.

1487
02:01:04,813 --> 02:01:06,804
when you finish fighting the bad men.

1488
02:01:09,698 --> 02:01:10,698
Yes.

1489
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:12,830
All the bad men are gone.

1490
02:01:16,182 --> 02:01:18,128
Does that mean you
can be my daddy now?

1491
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:32,720
Why are you crying, Daddy?

1492
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:38,270
I'm crying because I’m happy.

1493
02:01:41,647 --> 02:01:42,363
I’m really happy...

1494
02:01:43,686 --> 02:01:44,845
that I get to be your daddy now.

1495
02:02:14,882 --> 02:02:17,461
[Charlotte Giggling and Smiling]

1496
02:02:21,042 --> 02:02:23,159
It's like a fairytale land.

1497
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,380
Welcome to your
happily ever after, angel.

1498
02:02:45,879 --> 02:02:46,650
I love you woman.

1499
02:02:52,251 --> 02:02:52,836
