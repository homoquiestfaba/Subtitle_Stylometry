1
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,503
All right, mama.

2
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:43,838
You look well.

3
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,339
-Okay.
-I do?

4
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,874
Yeah, you do. You look nice.

5
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,776
-It's a lot.
-It is a lot.

6
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,411
Your back is gonna
start to hurt.

7
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,618
You gon' get bigger.
This ain't nothing yet.

8
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:59,386
Let me tell you right now,
this ain't nothing, right.

9
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,221
Your feet gon' swell.

10
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,624
-You like isolation, huh?
-They always do

11
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:04,358
this shit every fucking day!
I'm tired of it!

12
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,860
-You gotta talk
to your baby. -Yeah.

13
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,260
What, you want
a special invitation?

14
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,696
Get your ass in the line.
Let's go!

15
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,131
Oh, shut the fuck up
before I come over there!

16
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,289
Ain't no damn way
you coming back up in here.

17
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,559
-Why not?
-Back up.

18
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,897
I was wondering
why the hell you disappeared.

19
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,233
Rap sheet as long as
the goddamn sidewalk.

20
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,202
I'm-a call the cops,
you keep standing there.

21
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,672
All right, well, then
give me my two weeks back.

22
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,741
-From a year and a half ago?
-Then give me my job back.

23
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,610
You know what?

24
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,713
Here. Here-here you go.

25
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,381
That good enough for you?

26
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,822
Is that Inez?

27
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,958
How you doing, mama?

28
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:14,428
I thought you moved
to another shelter.

29
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,730
No, you know, I was in Rikers.

30
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,832
They had me in there
for boosting and shit.

31
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,834
Can't wait for you
to get at this hair, though.

32
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,770
If I go get the dye, will you
please do it for me next week?

33
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:23,971
I really missed you, girl.

34
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,372
Yeah, and apparently
these roots, too.

35
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,708
What you been doing?

36
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:27,942
-What she been doing?
-Nothing, nothing.

37
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,242
Yes, the roots missed you, too.

38
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,277
Come on, Terry, hurry up!

39
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,579
Hey-hey-hey-hey.

40
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,847
You ain't getting
nothing from the store

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,448
if you keep acting like that.

42
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,983
Inez, whatever
happened to that scammer nigga

43
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,384
you was fucking with?
You ever hear from him?

44
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,753
We missed you, yo.

45
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:42,824
Terry.

46
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:48,730
You don't hear me calling you?

47
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,733
You don't remember me now?

48
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,971
Just let me see your eyes, T,
so I know you're not mad at me.

49
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,606
He not gonna answer.

50
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,608
I'm back across
the street at the shelter.

51
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,977
And, look, I'm staying
out of trouble this time.

52
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,879
I'm-a be around here
for good now.

53
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,515
You hear that, T?

54
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,250
Just want to make sure
you're doing okay.

55
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:14,722
Here. Get you another Icee.

56
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,625
Look, y'all keep this
between us, a'ight?

57
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,761
Don't let nobody know
I came by here.

58
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,763
Okay.

59
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,632
-You're pretty.
-See y'all around.

60
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,367
Man, stop flirting with people.

61
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:44,451
Hey! Hey-hey-hey! None of that!

62
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,788
Get up. Get up. Okay, let's go!

63
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,556
Everybody,
if you don't know how to act,

64
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,692
then we not coming to the park!

65
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,393
Turn around. Let's go!

66
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,606
I got the perms,
the hairs, the weaves!

67
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,742
-Fuck out the street!
-Wash and dry!

68
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,442
I know you want
that hair done.

69
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,411
Next time, I'm-a hit you!

70
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,713
Hey-hey-hey, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma!

71
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:13,915
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me.

72
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:15,516
Hold on. Slow down.

73
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,018
Hey, hey, you know
you want me to do your hair.

74
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,052
Bitch, move!

75
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,921
What the fuck is wrong with you?

76
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,924
Thank you, baby.

77
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,859
Hey, come here.

78
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,661
How are you?

79
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,130
I want to take this French roll
out and put me some length in.

80
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,464
Yeah, you know,
I do braids for 75.

81
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,767
-Call me.
-All right, I will.

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,101
My number's right there,
right there.

83
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:35,670
A'ight.

84
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,139
I'm about to ask y'all
a serious question.

85
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,908
Who is y'all best player
of all time?

86
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:42,710
Bro, what?

87
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,746
Michael Jordan!

88
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,849
-Shawn.
-Huh? Oh. Oh, hi.

89
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:49,550
How's your friend doing?
I need to know he's okay.

90
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,418
Terry not here no more.
Stop asking.

91
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,954
Well, figure out
a better answer.

92
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,891
Now, if I tell you,
what are you gonna give me?

93
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,460
-Here.
-Thank you.

94
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,762
Now, what's up?

95
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,564
He at the hospital.

96
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:06,100
The hospital?
Why? Wh-What happened?

97
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,535
Running from our foster mother.

98
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,605
Fell out the window,
hit his head.

99
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,447
Let me see.

100
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,987
It hurt?

101
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,591
You know you could've died
doing something like that?

102
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,499
What's wrong with
the one I gave you?

103
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,636
It's corny.

104
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,605
All right, well, then buy
your own fucking toy, then.

105
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,614
What you like?

106
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,884
Power Rangers.

107
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,924
Tell me more about
your foster mother.

108
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,825
You like her?

109
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,532
She probably gone anyway.

110
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,234
When I was in foster care,

111
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,803
stuff like this happened
all the time.

112
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,541
My sister
used to look out for me.

113
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,143
But she ran away.

114
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,912
Where's she at now?

115
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,814
I don't know.

116
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,051
I can't find her.

117
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,453
My family's gone, boo.

118
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:46,734
You left me
on the street corner?

119
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,908
Who would tell you
something like that?

120
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,511
Why the fuck would they
tell you some shit like that?

121
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,885
Get that out your head.

122
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,632
Hey, yo, what's up, ma?
What you doing?

123
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,768
Pushing my way. Where you going?

124
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,314
Wow, really?

125
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,984
Hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

126
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,852
Want to split this?

127
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,921
Yeah.

128
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,756
Okay.

129
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,605
Um, T...

130
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,210
...I just wanted
to come say bye.

131
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,112
Just-just for a little while.

132
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:41,082
Um, I think they gonna move you.

133
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,720
I don't know where yet,

134
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,956
but I'll see you soon.

135
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:01,368
Save my beeper number,

136
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:04,638
just in case,

137
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,874
till I find you, okay?

138
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,745
When?

139
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,017
I don't know yet.

140
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,824
Why you keep leaving me?

141
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,143
Well, that means
you have bad luck,

142
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:47,848
because I'm about to do
a karate kick!

143
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,684
Pow! Pow!

144
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,122
Would it make you feel better
if you came to stay with me?

145
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,225
Just for a couple days?

146
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,794

He's gone.

165
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,260
But you wouldn't have
liked him anyway.

166
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,228
I got somebody else in mind.

You miss your old friends?

They're not my friends.

169
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:52,339
Yeah.

170
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:55,809
Sometimes I feel like
I ain't got no friends either.

171
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,813
Except you.

172
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,587
Ugh.

173
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,210
How much longer?

174
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,348
How much longer?

175
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,250
We're sorry.

176
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,453
-How much... -Terry,
just give me a minute, please.

177
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,622
We gonna sleep out here?

178
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,256
-You want to?
-No.

179
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,325
All right, then shut
the fuck up and let me finish!

180
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,126
...and try your call again.

181
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,862
Sorry for cursing.

182
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,431
Damn, Terry!

183
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,333
Just go, go.
Go back to Brooklyn.

184
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,602
-Go back to Brooklyn!
-I don't want to go back!

185
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,236
I'll call your social workers
right now!

186
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,072
I want to stay with you!

187
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,541
Well, then stop crying
and look at me.

188
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:02,943
All you got is me. Okay?

189
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,547
I'll go to war for you,
you know that?

190
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,282
Do you understand that?
Against anybody.

191
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,951
Against this whole
fucked-up city.

192
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,354
They can try all they want.
They can try all they want,

193
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,356
but they not breaking us up
this time.

194
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,293
You want to find a new home?

195
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,361
Hmm?

196
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,363
Yes.

197
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:25,199
But I need to know
we in this thing together.

198
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,900
Tell me.

199
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,970
-We're in this together.
-Tell me!

200
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,573
We're in this together!

201
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,963
Hello?

202
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,098
Kim? Boo, it's Inez.

203
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:00,334
Oh, my God, thank God
you got the same number.

204
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,136
Listen, I'm uptown.

205
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,045
<i>A'ight, y'all go sit</i>
<i>in the living room</i>

206
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,014
<i>while I talk to her real quick.</i>

207
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,315
-Is that Ghetto Inez
in my living room? -Shh.

208
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,050
When did you start
hanging with her again?

209
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,721
She's with her son.
Please don't say anything.

210
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:23,157
She needs a place to stay.

211
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,226
Want to come say hi?

212
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,062
Girl, I'm tired.

213
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,033
For how long?

214
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,169
I don't know.

215
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:38,071
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

216
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:42,075
<i>Good morning, sunshine.</i>

217
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,111
If y'all are hungry,

218
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,580
I'm-a make breakfast downstairs.

219
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,981
Come on, dance with me.

220
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,686
Oh.

221
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,756
Look at you. Look at you.

222
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,561
You get your GED?

223
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:02,329
-Inside.
-Really?

224
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,465
Yo, that's fly.

225
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,702
Bruh, you get, like, excited
about the weirdest things.

226
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:10,572
I'm proud of you.

227
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:11,673
So what's your plan?

228
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:15,075
You up here for good or...?

229
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,276
I don't know.

230
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,614
I'm tired of
these catty-ass shops.

231
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:22,349
-Start your own.
-With what money?

232
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,451
What am I supposed to do
right now?

233
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,354
Me and my son need
something to eat right now.

234
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:30,357
Yeah.

235
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,028
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you about Terry.

236
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:40,602
So, you have him
with, uh, Lucky?

237
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,807
Me and Lucky were broken up
when I had T.

238
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,242
He still locked up?

239
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,109
Yeah.

240
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,278
I'll introduce them
when he gets out.

241
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,523
The city had him.

242
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:04,592
He's not supposed to be with me.

243
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:07,160
Yo, can't you get locked up
for some shit like that?

244
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,296
Not if you keep it to yourself.

245
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:23,210
It's safe with me.

246
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:33,453
Inez, we good.

247
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:38,458
Look at
the cute little dinosaurs.

248
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,162
-They look dumb.
-Okay, no, they don't.

249
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,431
Stop being mean.

250
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,433
She working?

251
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,571
I think she went
job hunting today.

252
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:52,574
You can't go to anybody's place
looking and talking like that.

253
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:53,875
And all that yakking.

254
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:56,476
Ma, she can borrow my stuff.

255
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:59,614
Terry, you like
the coloring books, baby?

256
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,717
Good.
You know, when I was your age,

257
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,217
my mother taught me how to read.

258
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,653
She spent a lot of time with me.

259
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:08,288
Well, let me get a, um,
a loosie, a Big Burst

260
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,091
and some sunflower seeds,
the nacho cheese ones.

261
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,227
...a six-year-old boy snatched.

262
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,196
Brookdale,
one of the city's most troubled

263
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,366
and underfunded hospitals,
reports the child was spending

264
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,368
one of his last mornings
in patient care.

265
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,505
Um, they talking about that kid
that got snatched in Brooklyn?

266
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,874
I don't know that story.

267
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:29,577
All right, um, matter of fact,
let me get a newspaper, too.

268
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,613
...information
to please call Crime Stoppers

269
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:36,216
at 800-577-1212.

270
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,698
-Jones residence.
-Yeah, Kim,

271
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:52,299
I need you to make sure
you keep Terry in your sight.

272
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,801
Don't let him out of your sight.

273
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:54,902
What?

274
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:58,238
Just keep him in the house.

275
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,307
-Inez, where are you?
-Just do it! Please, Kim!

276
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,377
I don't want nobody
asking questions.

277
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,213
-I got to handle some things.
-Of course.

278
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,886
-She say where she was at?
-Uh-uh.

279
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,320
Doesn't make no sense.

280
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,789
It doesn't take this long
to look for work.

281
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,256
You like to play games, Terry?

282
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,191
This is ridiculous.

283
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:22,329
So quiet.

284
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:26,299
Who's hiding in there?

285
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:30,938
Hmm?

286
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,310
I found work.

287
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:45,653
Come on, boo,
so you can try these on.

288
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:50,792
You like 'em?

289
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:53,728
They're too big.

290
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:55,730
You'll grow into them.

291
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,700

just spit it out!

You want to be taken serious,

00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:13,841
be from Harlem, not of Harlem.

320
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,979
So that's it?

321
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:20,548
You don't have

That I'm nothing?
A streetwalker?

326
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,999
You can't keep fighting
everyone you disagree with.

327
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:39,801
We got to grow up.

328
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,904

But, like, what?

330
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:49,476
When are you going to realize
that you are enough?

331
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,112
Who cares what she says?

332
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:54,849
Why even let
any of that shit get to you?

333
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:01,923
Sh...

334
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,760
She said I was a bad mother.

335
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:11,933
Come here. Come here.

336
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:23,343
She forgets you don't have one.

337
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,153
Hey, you.

338
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:36,057
You better get that chip
off your shoulder.

339
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,358
I know you hear me.

340
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:42,462
Come on.

341
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:48,936
All right, promise me
you're gonna be good for Mommy?

342
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,466
T, don't go up.

343
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,703
We don't really know
anybody here.

344
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,908
I lied.

345
00:23:33,214 --> 00:23:35,049
Don't look at me like that.

346
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,051
Get off me.

347
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:40,121
-Why you being mean to me?
-'Cause you keep fucking up!

348
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:41,789
Ow!

349
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:43,658
Who said you could
talk to me like that?

350
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:46,527
-I liked them! -Okay, well,
yeah, what about me?

351
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,995
What about me, Terry?!

352
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,965
Some shit is more important
than some coloring books.

353
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:01,474
I didn't mean to hurt you.

354
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:11,852
Wait right here.

355
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:23,698
Hey, this is Wanda.

356
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:27,702
Leave a message after the beep,
and I'll call you back.

357
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,525
-Hello?
-Hi. This Cynthia?

358
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,960
-Who this?
-Listen, I need a favor.

359
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:54,729
-What? -Yeah, the building
that I'm living in,

360
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,897
it got asbestos,
and they cleared everybody out.

361
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:58,799
Inez, I'm sorry.
You can't stay here.

362
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,601
The number

363
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,671
you are calling is no longer
in service.

364
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:04,905
-Hello. -It's
your old hairdresser, Inez.

365
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,607
-You said who?
-Just give me the address,

366
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,743
-and we'll come by later.
Terry! -I did not say...

367
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:15,149
Terry, are you crazy?!
Where were you going?!

368
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,051
-Get off me! Get off me!
-Are you crazy?!

369
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:19,687
Our stuff was in there!--

370
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:59,060
I can't go back to that shelter.

371
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,962
How long you been
on the street?

372
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,764
Long enough.

373
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,968
Where are your people?

374
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:13,674
Gone.

375
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,609
Gone where?

376
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,878
You from up here?

377
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:21,882
I lost them.

378
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,851
Lost them how?

379
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,663
Yeah.

380
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:37,998
You and the rest of us.

381
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:42,403
My baby girl's still struggling.

382
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:45,773
Her son's about the same age
as your little boy.

383
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,009
Pea?

384
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:52,012
Pea?

385
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:54,348
You can take the little room
on the second floor.

386
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:55,883
Yes?

387
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:58,352
Clear your things from
Sadie's old room. Hmm?

388
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:00,855
-Okay?
-Okay.

389
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:02,723
And like I tell all my tenants,

390
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,893
try anything,
I keep a .44 ready.

391
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,130
Go show him where to go, baby.

392
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:10,764
Is this your house?

393
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,036
<i>Ooh!</i>

394
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:19,140
Mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm.

395
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:21,942
Mm. Girl.

396
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:23,077
It's nothing.

397
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,080
Does that mean
I don't have to pay you?

398
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:29,750
Well...

399
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:33,020
Girl, I feel like something.

400
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:43,130
-Thank you, sweetie.
-Mm-hmm.

401
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,702
I can't even get it this time.

402
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,337
Where does the rent go?

403
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,139
That-- No.

404
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,242
Just leave it right there.

405
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,211
Got him.

406
00:27:57,244 --> 00:27:59,180
Yeah.

407
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,048
Oh, no, wait.

408
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:04,084
-You ever see her?
-Who? Oh, Crystal?

409
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:06,053
Yeah, your daughter.

410
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:07,888
She, um...

411
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:11,325
She's cleaned up a few times.

412
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,961
That's a battle I can't fight.

413
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:18,098
She'll come home for good
when she's ready.

414
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:23,837
By the way, if you're still
looking for better money,

415
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:28,776
uh, a friend of mine
might have a job for you.

416
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,244
Really? Where at?

417
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:33,013
Cleaning staff for a
nursing home on Jamaica Avenue.

418
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,481
-In Queens?
-Yes, Queens.

419
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,483
That's, like,
a two-hour train ride.

420
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:39,153
Well, do what you want.

421
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:42,223
Just don't waste any more time
feeling sorry for yourself.

422
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:51,098
Your generation don't know
just how good you have it.

423
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:02,309
<i>Jaywalking</i>
<i>is a fact of life here.</i>

424
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:03,978
<i>No more, says Mayor Giuliani.</i>

425
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:06,180
<i>He plans to crack down</i>
<i>on pedestrians who cross</i>

426
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,082
<i>where and when</i>
<i>they're not supposed to.</i>

427
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,883
<i>I'll walk where I want</i>
<i>to walk! Motherfucker...</i>

428
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,785
<i>Plan with me</i>

429
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,555
<i>to make the realistic changes</i>

430
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,890
<i>that will actually</i>
<i>make people's lives</i>

431
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,859
<i>better than they are right now,</i>

432
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,028
<i>and work hard with me</i>

433
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:24,898
<i>to apply these plans</i>
<i>to improve our city.</i>

434
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,367
<i>Improve these nuts!</i>

435
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,136
GIULIANI
<i>Dream, believe,</i>

436
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:31,071
<i>plan and work.</i>

437
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:35,009
<i>This is the foundation</i>
<i>for the process of change.</i>

438
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:51,191
Say, "Hi, Mommy."

439
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,994
-Hey.
-Hi.

440
00:29:54,028 --> 00:29:57,164
Tell Mommy
what books we read today.

441
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:58,465
Hey, girl.

442
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,314
The dash is missing.

443
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:15,115
Huh?

444
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:19,019
Never mind.

445
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:27,961
Yo, how much they charge you?

446
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,331
-350.
-Okay.

447
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:32,433
You did good, babe.

448
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:35,903
How you like the job?

449
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,975
I miss doing hair.

450
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,582
He back in school yet?

451
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:49,450
Hand me a screw.

452
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,860
Got to get a copy of his
birth certificate and all that.

453
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:04,865
I, um, started applying, too.

454
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,536
I'm going to Clark Atlanta
in the fall.

455
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,137
You leaving us?

456
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,406
I wouldn't say it like that.

457
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,682
I'm happy for you.

458
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:23,250
You could go back, too.

459
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:26,887
Even if it's, like, part-time
or something like that.

460
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:30,157
Yeah, someday.

461
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,029
All right, baby.

462
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:39,299
You got cereal and milk.
Leftovers is in the fridge.

463
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:42,069
And don't heat it up
for over 60 seconds,

464
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:43,705
'cause if you do,
your mouth will get burnt.

465
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:46,407
And do not answer the door
for anybody.

466
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,375
If the phone rings,

467
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:51,378
wait for the answering machine
to come on to see if it's me.

468
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:54,516
Okay?

469
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,052
I'll be back from work
around 6:00.

470
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:09,329
Okay?

471
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:11,265
Be good, boo.

472
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,022
Today, the streets are

473
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:36,990
even more dangerous
than you think.

474
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:38,459
You like flying?

475
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:41,328
I got something
that'll really make you fly.

476
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,263
So talk to your kids
about drugs, or...

477
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:06,253
Quincy Jones
has made his mark in music

478
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:09,256
as a composer,
conductor and arranger

479
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:11,425
during a time
when it was almost unheard of

480
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,529
for a Black composer
to do a Hollywood movie.

481
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:16,631
The imagination's always been

482
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:19,099
a comfort zone,
safety zone really,

483
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:22,202
because it's something
that you run to

484
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,238
and make it anything you want...

485
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:48,095
This house look...

486
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,201
Everything okay?

487
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:01,509
Why nobody looking for me?

488
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:07,147
Because we made it
too hard for them.

489
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:11,218
That was the whole point,
remember?

490
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:17,391
Come here.

491
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,367
Hey.

492
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,141
Look.

493
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:37,311
I don't know
what the fuck to tell you, T.

494
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:40,582
But there's more to life
than fucked-up beginnings.

495
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:46,286
You're not holding it right.

496
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,657
Hey, talk to me nice.
I got this.

497
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,893
You ready?

498
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:54,328
You ready-ready?

499
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,866
Yeah!

500
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,301
You did it! You did it!
You did it!

501
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,707
You gonna throw it
all the way over...

502
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,446
Throw that thing
better than that.

503
00:35:19,754 --> 00:35:21,488
Now you just being lazy.

504
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,792
You ready?

505
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:26,694
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

506
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,396
Mm.

507
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,737
Oh! Okay, yeah, you did it.

508
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,708
I never had my own room
growing up.

509
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:42,810
You want to try?

510
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:45,513
Who lived here before us?

511
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,515
I don't know.
A bunch of immigrants.

512
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:49,584
-And before them?
-I don't know, baby.

513
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:52,419
We can go to the library
and look it up.

514
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:56,356
Down and up. Down...

515
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,201
Who's that?

516
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,207
This is me.

517
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:17,745
When I was first coming out
of the group home.

518
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,379
Cute little thing.

519
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,953
My body was a playground
for a thousand niggas

520
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:27,320
-before you came along.
-That's nasty.

521
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:30,390
Hey, I got more of us,

522
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,259
but things get lost
when we moving around so much.

523
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,929
-Yo. Open up.
-Hold on, hold on.

524
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:37,197
It's Rudy.

525
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:40,333
-Hello.
-Hey.

526
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,306
Don't be mad I'm late.

527
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:47,608
Some of the papers
took longer to get.

528
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:49,644
What if he needs
to go to the doctor?

529
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:51,846
Just show up and say he's sick.

530
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:55,950
-And I got this from the city
so it looks legit. -Okay.

531
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:58,986
Hotbox, numbers.

532
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,556
-Whatever you need, hit me up.
-Okay.

533
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,490
-Okay?
-Okay.

534
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:11,866
Okay, I went with Daryl,
last name Raymond.

535
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,735
We just moved in from Jersey.

536
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:16,537
Your middle name is Terry.

537
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:18,371
I don't like it.

538
00:37:21,642 --> 00:37:24,244
Hey, Kim.

539
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:27,749
Daryl Raymond.

540
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:31,552
Three, two, one. Now!

541
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:48,401
That's him?

542
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:55,475
Why you standing there
looking scared?

543
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:02,817
Neighbor down the hall walks
him home for me after school.

544
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:06,788
Terry, I want you to meet Lucky.

545
00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:14,996
Hey, Lucky.

546
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:17,532
What's up, little man?

547
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:20,935
Lucky's gonna be
moving in with us.

548
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:23,738
For how long?

549
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,907
Damn.

550
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:31,344
Little nigga trying
to kick me out already.

551
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:33,848
Come here.

552
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,889
What's this cut on your face?

553
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:50,463
Let me get one
for good luck, babe.

554
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,432
Let me get one for good luck.

555
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:53,634
Mm, mm-mm-mm.

556
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:55,435
You can get a shot.
You want a shot?

557
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:57,872
Come on, you can get a shot.
Go ahead. Take a shot.

558
00:38:57,905 --> 00:38:59,841
Terry! Terry!

559
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,142
Yeah, get it, Pea!

560
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,677
-Pea, out! Pea, out!
-Not in my kitchen!

561
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,978
-Not in my kitchen!
-Look at the D.

562
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:05,012
Look at the D!

563
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:07,414
Good job, Pea.

564
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:11,586
-Shoot!
-I'll... I'll take it.

565
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:12,987
-Let me get another.
-No.

566
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,487
Pass it.

567
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:17,725
Want to go again?

568
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:21,696
What's wrong?

569
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:38,779
Where was he before?

570
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:41,782
How many times
you gonna ask me that?

571
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:43,383
Till I get an answer.

572
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:48,623
He belongs with his mother.

573
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:50,191
Nobody's even looking for him.

574
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:51,592
Course they're not
looking for him

575
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:53,094
because they're looking for me.

576
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:56,597
And every other nigga round here
with a target on they back.

577
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:59,033
Hey, how many times I been
locked up for you, Lucky?

578
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,835
I just got out, man!

579
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,771
Trying to move on
from all that shit.

580
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:05,206
Do you remember
what it felt like

581
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,407
to grow up without a father?

582
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:13,547
I just want us to be a family.
That's all.

583
00:40:14,682 --> 00:40:17,018
That's not my fucking kid.

584
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,689
I just wanted you.

585
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,795
But you fucked-up in the head.

586
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,463
Yeah, nuts for thinking
you would fucking understand.

587
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:33,067
I didn't sign up for this shit.

588
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:41,809
"You are not a cow.

589
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:45,880
You are not a boat
or a plane or a snore."

590
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:47,548
-"Snort."
-"Snort."

591
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:49,216
Stop.

592
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,519
<i>"You are not a boat."</i>

593
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:53,621
-"Or-or..."
-"Or a plane

594
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,957
-or a snort."
-"Snort."

595
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,263
"You are a... bird?

596
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:04,031
And you are my mother."

597
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,000
Yeah.

598
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:08,970
"And you are my mother.

599
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:11,806
And you are my mother.
And you are..."

600
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:54,081
I literally saw you
look at her with my own eyes.

601
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,719
Is it 'cause
she lighter than me?

602
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:00,921
-'Cause her hair's nicer?
-You're too sensitive.

603
00:42:00,955 --> 00:42:03,858
Well, then just be sensitive
to my sensitivity.

604
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:10,898
Where'd you stay
this whole time?

605
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,834
Was posted up with Mike.

606
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:17,038
-That bike not hot, is it?
-No.

607
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:21,542
One.

608
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:26,947
All right,
I need another can of broth.

609
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:30,651
Come on, let me do that
after the game.

610
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:32,887
No. Can you go now?

611
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,090
And why don't you take
Terry with you?

612
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:00,915
How you doing, Lucky?

613
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:03,284
I'm good, 'Licia.
How you doing, shorty?

614
00:43:03,317 --> 00:43:05,152
You should call me.

615
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:11,659
Do me a favor.

616
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:14,028
Walk on this side of me.

617
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:16,130
It's for your protection.

618
00:43:23,037 --> 00:43:25,072
You always this quiet?

619
00:43:28,142 --> 00:43:30,244
Sometimes.

620
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,680
And what you thinking about?

621
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:36,150
Well, it sounds like a lot.

622
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:40,287
How did you get that name Lucky?

623
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:45,259
Made a few mistakes, that's all.

624
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,962
That's a story for another time.

625
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,364
-And I'm a mistake, too?
-Who told you that?

626
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:53,367
It's why you don't
want me around.

627
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,169
That's not true.

628
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:58,038
You're a blessing.

629
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,241
For your mom especially.

630
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:03,144
Everything is just...

631
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:07,982
...just complicated.

632
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,051
A'ight? Come on.

633
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,166
How'd you get that one?

634
00:44:30,738 --> 00:44:32,840
Guy cut me with a knife.

635
00:44:32,873 --> 00:44:34,141
Why?

636
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:43,951
He wanted something I took.

637
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:02,937
You see this one right here?

638
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,238
See it?

639
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:07,474
On the East Side,

640
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:10,512
everybody hide
they box cutters right here.

641
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:12,112
It hurt?

642
00:45:14,448 --> 00:45:16,850
Yeah, a little bit.

643
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:36,837
Everything's changing.

644
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,272
A couple of years from now,

645
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:41,275
we're not gonna have to worry
about this at all.

646
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:00,160
What do two crooks know
about raising a family?

647
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,506
<i>Yeah!</i>

648
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:14,908
Let me get a picture.

649
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:16,844
Girl, he holding you
like he love you, okay?

650
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,546
Terry, now!

651
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,848
And we on the block
right now celebrating.

652
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,883
Shout-out to the newlyweds,

653
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:24,451
-Lucky and Inez.
-Yes, girl, show me the ring!

654
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:26,487
Okay! All right!

655
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:30,257
What the ring like?

656
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,594
That's exactly what
we bringing here to the block.

657
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:34,194
Right here, right now.

658
00:46:34,228 --> 00:46:36,130
Come get a plate.
Come get a cup.

659
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,831
Come get whatever you need,

660
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:39,099
and come rock out with your boy.

661
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:40,968
Come here.

662
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:44,938
You look good, ma.
You look good.

663
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:48,042
T...

664
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:52,813
...your mother's my wife now.

665
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:55,883
But I want you to know
from the bottom of my heart

666
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:58,118
that I'm here
for the both of you.

667
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:02,089
We blood now.

668
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:06,460
You scared I'm-a take her
away from you?

669
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,128
No.

670
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:12,099
Nobody's going anywhere
from this point on.

671
00:47:13,635 --> 00:47:16,538
I promise to protect you
and your mother.

672
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:19,006
You understand?

673
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,474
Yes.

674
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:24,311
We're gonna give you
the life that we never had.

675
00:47:24,345 --> 00:47:26,480
A'ight?

676
00:47:26,514 --> 00:47:28,982
You hear me? Hmm?

677
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:32,453
Come here.

678
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:40,094
Up-up-up.
There we go. There we go.

679
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:42,597
Girl, you got you
a family now.

680
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,502
King of the world!

681
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:49,103
We got to get this.

682
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:50,538
Hold on. Hold on.
Here we go. Here we go.

683
00:47:50,572 --> 00:47:52,039
-Oh, wait, wait, wait.
-Look at the camera, T.

684
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:53,575
-Look at the camera.
-Ready?

685
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,977
Say, "Family!"

686
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,879
Family.

687
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,253
I'm so happy for y'all.

688
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:23,671
Let me see.

689
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:43,257
What you want to hear?

690
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,258
That one.

691
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:48,228
<i>If federal court</i>

692
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,330
<i>lets new zoning laws</i>

693
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:53,000
<i>42nd Street will have to take</i>

694

<i>the crackdown</i>
<i>on low-level offenses</i>

<i>is a quality-of-life issue.</i>

<i>the true nature</i>
<i>of the establishment,</i>

00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:19,359
<i>firing 41 bullets...</i>

709
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:20,762
<i>The shockwaves</i>
<i>are still being felt</i>

710
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:22,463
<i>in New York City tonight</i>

711
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:25,299
<i>following the acquittals</i>
<i>in the controversial trial.</i>

712
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,602
<i>An officer is</i>
<i>allowed to stop, question you.</i>

713
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:30,505
<i>If he develops any more</i>
<i>suspicions, he can frisk you.</i>

714
00:49:30,538 --> 00:49:32,674
<i>So, really,</i>
<i>it should be described as</i>

715
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:36,143
<i>stop-question-frisk.</i>

716
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,750
Yer.

717
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:44,251
What up, T?

718
00:49:44,284 --> 00:49:45,587
Yer.

719
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:48,388
How you been?

720
00:49:48,422 --> 00:49:50,592
<i>I'm not starting freshman year</i>
<i>without no pussy, B.</i>

721
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,493
Light skin, fatty, exotic,

722
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:54,762
hair down to the ass,
no medium to hot breath...

723
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:56,230
Nigga, them shorties
don't want you.

724
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:58,065
No, nigga, that's standards.

725
00:49:58,098 --> 00:50:00,367
Don't fault me
for caring about my heart.

726
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:03,270
Go get that.

727
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:06,106
Nah, nah.

728
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:08,475
-I'm good.
-"Nah." Keep not listening.

729
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,077
I am listening!

730
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,445
See how they respond
to that nice shit, man?

731
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:14,314
-What's good with that?
-I just got my own style.

732
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:16,183
Since when is
"bum nigga" a style?

733
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:17,552
Hey, hey. You, you. Now.

734
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:19,253
Up against the wall, right now.

735
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:20,655
Yeah, just put
your hands where I can see 'em.

736
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:22,590
-Don't make any
sudden move. -Damn, bro.

737
00:50:22,624 --> 00:50:24,258
Thought you looked older.

738
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,528
<i>Daryl can be</i>
<i>a little aloof sometimes.</i>

739
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:28,295
He daydreams a lot.

740
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:31,498
But overall
he's a very bright kid.

741
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:33,501
I was surprised to see
that you were his mother.

742
00:50:33,535 --> 00:50:38,038
Most of our students here
aren't as articulate.

743
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:42,309
Oh, is that so?

744
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:45,513
To be honest,
Mrs. Raymond, um...

745
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:49,449
...I don't think
Daryl belongs here.

746
00:50:49,483 --> 00:50:50,852
Have you thought about

747
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:54,221
applying to
the specialized high schools?

748
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:56,591
No.

749
00:50:56,624 --> 00:50:58,593
I'd like you to meet Ms. Tucker.

750
00:50:58,626 --> 00:51:00,260
Hi.

751
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:02,530
She's a counselor at
Tech, Science and Leadership.

752
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:05,533
I also run an outreach program
on the side

753
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:09,436
to get more students like Daryl
to take the test.

754
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:12,205
Would you be open
to that, Daryl?

755
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:16,209
If they got girls.

756
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:21,348
A lot of the kids
go on to MIT, Harvard.

757
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:23,450
It might take
some getting used to.

758
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:26,186
There wouldn't be
as many minorities.

759
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,221
Ma, you know
the Laundromat shut down?

760
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:29,857
Yeah, they sold the building.

761
00:51:29,891 --> 00:51:32,192
So, where we supposed to go?

762
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:35,663
Go down to Ramirez.
What's a couple of blocks?

763
00:51:35,697 --> 00:51:38,398
I don't like going over there.

764
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:39,634
Well...

765
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:43,370
We got stopped
by the cops again.

766
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:47,474
Um, were they looking
for someone?

767
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:48,509
I don't know.

768
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:51,278
Did they take your name?

769
00:51:51,311 --> 00:51:52,312
No.

770
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:55,583
I'm just calling it out
so you know it ain't me.

771
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:59,887
Girl, and then he talk
about he want to move in.

772
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:01,689
I'm like, "Are you paying
half the rent?"

773
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:03,925
-Hey, girl. How you doing?
-Hey, girl, what's up?

774
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,560
Hello.

775
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:07,528
Girl, so, you know,
like, I'm a woman.

776
00:52:07,562 --> 00:52:09,664
I shouldn't be paying rent
if a man stay here.

777
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:12,199
-You know what I'm saying?
-What's going on over there?

778
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:14,167
Girl, you know
they bought the building.

779
00:52:15,503 --> 00:52:17,672
But anyway, girl, what you
think I should do, though?

780
00:52:17,705 --> 00:52:20,642
You think I should,
like, split the rent?

781
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:22,209
Girl, I don't know.

782
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:24,579
Right,
'cause I ain't doing that.

783
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:32,920
-Ah!
-Scared me half to death.

784
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:35,523
-Here, let me get that.
-Any-Anything else?

785
00:52:36,557 --> 00:52:38,926
Mom, I'm hungry.

786
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,828
Well, then go to the store.

787
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:42,262
With what money?

788
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:44,565
I gave you money
earlier this week, Terry.

789
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:46,433
Come on.

790
00:52:47,502 --> 00:52:49,671
Look, I only got
ten dollars to my name.

791
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:52,507
I'm giving you five.

792
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,608
Here.

793
00:52:58,378 --> 00:53:00,480
You thought any more
about what she said?

794
00:53:00,515 --> 00:53:02,850
-Who said?
-Your teacher.

795
00:53:02,884 --> 00:53:05,520
Why does everything good mean
I got to go somewhere else?

796
00:53:05,553 --> 00:53:07,588
Well...

797
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,693
You'll probably fit right in.

798
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:13,260
As soft as you are,

799
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:15,697
I'd rather that
than you chasing after Pea.

800
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,832
Speaking of him, I'm switching
to the night shift

801
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,300
so I can be here after school.

802
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,969
Make sure you're not
just running around.

803
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:23,738
What's up with you and Luck?

804
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:25,940
Excuse me?

805
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,475
Y'all not talking or something?

806
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:35,215
Stop trying
to change the subject.

807
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,253
Listen.

808
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:42,489
I'm not saying you got to go.

809
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:44,859
But at least think about it.

810
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:48,462
I'll buy you
a new pair of Jordans.

811
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,600
In each portion,

812
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,302
you will have approximately
ten minutes per section...

813
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:23,497
Ooh.

814
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:25,633
What, you want me to pull up
there with you or something?

815
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,769
'Cause you acting
mad pussy right now.

816
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:39,781
Anything else?

817
00:54:39,814 --> 00:54:40,982
Yeah, where can I call you?

818
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:43,017
Simone, quit playing.

819
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,719
A'ight, give me
your name on AOL.

820
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:47,420
"Unavailable222."

821
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:49,023
Wow, so I can't even
get to know you?

822
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:50,625
Yeah, get her, T.

823
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:52,794
Listen, there's nothing else
I need to know about you

824
00:54:52,827 --> 00:54:54,962
or your little dirty-ass,
smelly-ass friend.

825
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:59,000
Stop acting like we ain't
doing you a favor, Midnight.

826
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:01,636
-Nappy-head-ass.
-Next customer.

827
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,076
Knew you wasn't getting that.

828
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,078
I ain't trippin' on her.

829
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:12,780
'Cause I already tried
four times.

830
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:15,583
-Got to be a dyke!
-Shut the hell up, Pea.

831
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:17,852
That's why I want one
of them Indian-looking girls.

832
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:19,419
Shoot, they fire.

833
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:22,690
Let me see. Let me see it.

834
00:55:24,058 --> 00:55:25,927
Oh, my...

835
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,062
You got into Tech?

836
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:29,730
I don't see the big deal.

837
00:55:29,764 --> 00:55:32,432
Thought all I had to do
was prove that I can get in.

838
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:34,836
I changed my mind.

839
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:36,637
Well, I didn't! I ain't going!

840
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:39,406
Boy, you know how hard
I'm busting my ass

841
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,108
to get you chances I never had?

842
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:44,377
You make me feel like
a damn fool.

843
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:46,714
-Be a fool, then.
-Boy!

844
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:52,119
<i>I need you to talk some sense</i>
<i>into him.</i>

845
00:55:52,153 --> 00:55:53,754
Please.

846
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,427
Saying what, exactly?

847
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,830
That he should go
to a better school.

848
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:05,867
He doesn't want
to be controlled.

849
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,468
Who gives a fuck about
what he wants?

850
00:56:08,502 --> 00:56:11,005
What does he need?

851
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:12,907
I don't know.

852
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:23,150
Matter of fact, I do.

853
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,454
It's you.

854
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,724
Like how?

855
00:56:30,992 --> 00:56:32,760
You're too tough.

856
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:38,165
Okay. What else?

857
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:39,901
I'm listening.

858
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:45,873
Maybe if you quiet down some...

859
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:51,411
...he would actually hear
what you have to say.

860
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:55,516
Okay.

861
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:58,753
I don't even remember the
last time I raised my voice.

862
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:02,523
He'd do good at any school.

863
00:57:11,032 --> 00:57:13,968
You used to like
when I got spicy.

864
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:19,040
"Try and be quiet."

865
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:23,945
"You should try and be quiet."

866
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:25,646
Right?

867
00:57:26,714 --> 00:57:28,950
Quiet like when
you went missing for weeks

868
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:30,518
and I sat here and said nothing?

869
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:32,954
And never mind who you was with.

870
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:34,956
-See, there it go.
-If I get any more quieter,

871
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:36,824
I won't even have
a fucking voice at all.

872
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:38,626
You know, I'm not about
to sit here and argue with you.

873
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:39,894
That's real easy for you to say

874
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:41,796
'cause you get to be
the saint, right?!

875
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:43,798
You get to be the saint
while I'm stuck here

876
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:45,599
fighting these wars
all by myself!

877
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:47,702
-See how loud you're getting?
-What...

878
00:57:47,735 --> 00:57:50,838
-Well, then fucking show up
for me, Lucky. -Fuck this shit.

879
00:57:50,871 --> 00:57:52,673
Show up for me!

880
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:03,884
I wonder what'd happen
if I leave, too.

881
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:20,901
You scared.

882
00:58:23,637 --> 00:58:25,906
Something's gonna happen.

883
00:58:28,576 --> 00:58:30,911
I can feel it.

884
00:58:32,246 --> 00:58:33,848
I can feel it.

885
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:37,985
Did he tell you he got stopped
by the cops again?

886
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:40,154
A few times.

887
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:43,157
Then let him use his other name.

888
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,592
He doesn't have an I.D.

889
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:47,528
That's not
the fucking point, Lucky!

890
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:50,731
Shit. I don't know, a'ight?

891
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:53,634
Day's bound to come
any-fucking-way.

892
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:17,324
Take care of your moms, T!

893
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:18,993
Where Luck going?

894
00:59:19,026 --> 00:59:21,662
And you--
I'm-a say this one time.

895
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:24,298
You look at me when
I'm fucking talking to you.

896
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:26,233
It's either
you go to that school

897
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:28,936
or you find
somewhere else to live.

898
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,137
You hear me?

899
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,110
...where to push
and where not to push.

900
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:11,946
But I'm-a take but so much,
and she gon' take but so much,

901
01:00:11,979 --> 01:00:13,714
so we compromise.

902
01:00:13,747 --> 01:00:15,349
It works out for you guys.

903
01:00:15,382 --> 01:00:18,285
So, you gonna get married or...?

904
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,688
-Uh... -All
right, all right, all right.

905
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:21,956
--That-That's
a whole nother show.

906
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:23,858
I'm sorry.
You had a comment. Yes?

907
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,793
You say you do it
for the attention.

908
01:00:25,826 --> 01:00:27,194
There are other ways
of getting attention.

909
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:28,929
Don't-- doesn't it cost you
a lot of friendships

910
01:00:28,963 --> 01:00:30,731
and relationships,
being a bitch?

911
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:32,399
Well, it has cost me
a lot of friendships

912
01:00:32,433 --> 01:00:33,968
and a lot of relationships,

913
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:36,270
but I find in life
that sometimes

914
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:38,806
having a friend in yourself
is better than having--

915
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:40,774
worrying about
having people as your friends,

916
01:00:40,808 --> 01:00:42,776
'cause no one's gonna
look out for you but you,

917
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,812
and I've learned that in life.

918
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:47,815
I've looked out for people,
you know, but...

919
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:49,884
You seem to make some sense.

920
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:53,053
I mean, I'm saying,
I-I have friends now.

921
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:55,222
They're bitchy like me,
so we get along.

922
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,292
We-- I'm serious.
We understand each other.

923
01:00:58,325 --> 01:00:59,760
And, like, I'm-I'm generous...

924
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:01,128
-They got
a little dog pound. -Right.

925
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:03,464
And I help, I help out
some of my family members

926
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:05,466
as well as they help me.

927
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:08,035
But they also know
where to push my buttons

928
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:10,304
and where to go also,
as Paul said.

929
01:01:10,337 --> 01:01:11,839
Okay, yes?

930
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:13,440
I know
I like to get what I want,

931
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:15,276
but I think there are
other ways to do that.

932
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:17,144
That only makes people...

933
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,365
Come shoot some hoops with me.

934
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:40,067
I'm about to go to the store.

935
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,036
Come here.

936
01:01:48,242 --> 01:01:49,443
You need some money?

937
01:01:49,476 --> 01:01:51,845
-Ma gave me some.
-Here.

938
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:54,949
Take it anyway.

939
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:58,852
A man should always have
some money in his pocket.

940
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:03,958
So, um, where you been at?

941
01:02:14,835 --> 01:02:16,971
I needed some time
to clear my head.

942
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:27,781
Feels like it's been a lot
longer than that this time.

943
01:02:27,815 --> 01:02:30,017
Y'all breaking up or something?

944
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,822
Want to shoot?

945
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:50,037
Your mother ever tell you
how we met?

946
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,409
No.

947
01:02:55,442 --> 01:02:56,844
She used to work
at this coffee shop

948
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:59,280
that closed down
a few years ago.

949
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:01,815
I used to get my hair cut
right across the street.

950
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:03,984
I'd go in, I'd order me
a bagel or whatever,

951
01:03:04,018 --> 01:03:06,287
but I'm still not sure
how I'm-a kick it to her.

952
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:10,057
And ended up
telling her the truth.

953
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:15,029
That she was
the most beautiful woman...

954
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:19,867
...that I ever seen.

955
01:03:22,903 --> 01:03:25,072
Were you nervous?

956
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:30,844
I just felt like
she should know.

957
01:03:32,913 --> 01:03:35,049
But something told me
to go back, right?

958
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,352
This is when I had
my other bike.

959
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:43,891
A few days later, I said,
"Let me take you for a ride."

960
01:03:43,924 --> 01:03:46,260
We been rocking ever since.

961
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,138
T...

962
01:04:00,908 --> 01:04:02,876
...don't get caught up
in none of this shit

963
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,311
that you see around here.

964
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:06,146
Have I ever?

965
01:04:07,948 --> 01:04:10,217
Took me too long to learn that.

966
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,952
I don't want
to see you fall into

967
01:04:11,985 --> 01:04:14,355
the same traps
as me and your mother.

968
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:20,628
I want you to make
better choices than me.

969
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:22,996
When it comes to her.

970
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:25,366
When it comes to everything.

971
01:04:30,538 --> 01:04:32,406
I, uh...

972
01:04:34,408 --> 01:04:36,410
I got into
the specialized high school.

973
01:04:37,712 --> 01:04:39,947
Oh, yeah?

974
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,449
-So what you gon' do?
-I don't know.

975
01:04:42,483 --> 01:04:44,952
What you think?

976
01:04:44,985 --> 01:04:46,453
It's not up to me, T.

977
01:04:48,623 --> 01:04:50,991
You getting older now.

978
01:04:52,092 --> 01:04:55,095
Time for you to start
thinking for yourself.

979
01:05:21,288 --> 01:05:22,923
What?

980
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:30,130
I love you.

981
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,267
You hear me?

982
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,935
Yeah.

983
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:39,106
Check up.

984
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,414
Oh, got it.

985
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:52,286
Psst, psst.

986
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,954
Ayo, ma!

987
01:05:55,422 --> 01:05:57,191
What are you doing here?

988
01:05:57,224 --> 01:05:59,527
I can't walk with my lady?

989
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:16,009
How was work?

990
01:06:16,043 --> 01:06:17,311
Good.

991
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:19,614
Good morning.

992
01:06:19,647 --> 01:06:22,449
Yo, you remember what it's like
when we were coming up?

993
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:23,518
I remember.

994
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:27,054
You should be proud
of yourself, Inez.

995
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:29,490
We made it.

996
01:06:35,763 --> 01:06:38,131
You don't seem happy.

997
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:44,471
Think Terry resents me?

998
01:06:47,474 --> 01:06:49,109
Teenagers hate everybody.

999
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:52,145
But I do sense
a little void in him.

1000
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:55,315
First couple years of his life,
he ain't have nobody.

1001
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:58,318
Kid's still walking around here
with a broken heart.

1002
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:04,124
Maybe it's time for y'all
to have that conversation.

1003
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:07,261
Give him some of the answers
that he been looking for.

1004
01:07:09,129 --> 01:07:11,465
Yeah, I'll know
when the time's right.

1005
01:07:15,837 --> 01:07:17,605
Um...

1006
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:20,140
I was thinking,
when Terry goes off to school,

1007
01:07:20,173 --> 01:07:23,110
maybe I'll get
to doing hair again.

1008
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:25,312
Maybe open up a shop.

1009
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,518
Can't wait.

1010
01:07:40,862 --> 01:07:42,530
<i>Thank you.</i>

1011
01:07:43,598 --> 01:07:47,167
<i>Citizens, I am honored</i>
<i>and humbled to serve</i>

1012
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,304

1013
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:53,340

1014
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:55,577
<i>"New York is</i>

1015
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:58,880

1016
01:07:58,913 --> 01:08:00,848

<i>In the next four years,</i>

1018
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,587
<i>I will devote myself</i>

01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:14,161
<i>Thank you.</i>

1023
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:20,400
<i>I, Michael R. Bloomberg,</i>

1024
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:22,202

1025
01:08:22,235 --> 01:08:24,505
<i>-Do solemnly swear.</i>
<i>-That I will...</i>

1026
01:08:30,912 --> 01:08:34,882
So, um...
so, which one you, uh...

1027
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:37,619
which one you want to hear?

1028
01:08:40,655 --> 01:08:42,489
Let me hear that one.

1029
01:08:42,523 --> 01:08:44,892
It's mad old, though.

1030
01:08:46,326 --> 01:08:47,394
Old?

1031
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:49,162
The fuck is The Delfonics, B?

1032
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:50,898
Why don't you pass me
that one right there.

1033
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,266
-Yeah, who?
-Yeah.

1034
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,541
What does it say?

1035
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:05,312
The sample.

1036
01:09:05,345 --> 01:09:08,650
Wasn't too old for the Fugees.

1037
01:09:10,685 --> 01:09:12,285
Oh, come on.

1038
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,455
You don't even know
your own taste.

1039
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:18,392
Yo, these shits is, like,
mad random, though, like...

1040
01:09:18,425 --> 01:09:20,460
Yo, you deadass a old head.

1041
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:22,295
Like, what are you
talking about?

1042
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:23,865
Cassettes in here.

1043
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:25,499
What's going on?

1044
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:27,300
Come on.

1045
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:31,438
T.

1046
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:35,242
Hey, I want you
to hang on to that.

1047
01:09:36,878 --> 01:09:41,314
That way, you can take your time
flipping through everything.

1048
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,656
So, which college
you decided on?

1049
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:51,793
I don't know yet.

1050
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:54,261
You should be more excited.

1051
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,464
Nah.

1052
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:00,902
-I am.
-A'ight.

1053
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,235
Well, go somewhere far.

1054
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:04,605
You know, my era...

1055
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,843
...we ain't get
those kind of shots.

1056
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:10,812
Yeah.

1057
01:10:10,845 --> 01:10:12,714
Maybe.

1058
01:10:12,747 --> 01:10:16,383
Go on and show off
that legacy of Harlem.

1059
01:10:23,925 --> 01:10:26,994
Hi. I'm Jerry.

1060
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:29,997
Uh, I'm your new landlord.

1061
01:10:31,799 --> 01:10:34,936
The lady across the hall said
that your husband has cancer.

1062
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:37,004
Really sorry to hear that.

1063
01:10:37,038 --> 01:10:38,606
It's all right.

1064
01:10:38,639 --> 01:10:41,509
So you own those buildings
across the street, too?

1065
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:43,745
Yeah. Yeah.

1066
01:10:43,778 --> 01:10:46,013
Everything working okay?

1067
01:10:46,047 --> 01:10:47,849
Heat coming up?

1068
01:10:47,882 --> 01:10:49,382
Hot water? All that?

1069
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,552
I actually just realized
that, um,

1070
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:54,421
I got a few loose tiles
around my shower area.

1071
01:10:54,454 --> 01:10:57,525
Oh, yeah. Let's go look at it.

1072
01:10:57,558 --> 01:10:59,961
Uh-oh.

1073
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:02,797
Something happen here?

1074
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,498
Yeah.

1075
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:08,435
We tried to fix it a few times,
but it keeps falling off.

1076
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,906
-Oh, I can fix this for you.
-Really?

1077
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:14,509
Yeah. This is no problem at all.

1078
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:18,579
Um... wow.

1079
01:11:18,613 --> 01:11:20,380
Maybe some new cabinets, too,

1080
01:11:20,413 --> 01:11:23,918
because these have to be
at least 20 years old.

1081
01:11:23,951 --> 01:11:26,453
-Have you met Javier?
-Who?

1082
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:28,790
-Uh, the new super.
-No.

1083
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:32,093
Okay, let me see
when I can get my guys in here

1084
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:34,394
to take care of all of this,

1085
01:11:34,427 --> 01:11:37,532
and then also your...
also your tiles, okay?

1086
01:11:37,565 --> 01:11:40,835
-Thank you.
-Yeah. You got it. No problem.

1087
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:43,604
Hey.

1088
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:53,781

1089
01:11:57,018 --> 01:11:59,053

Yes?

01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:18,793
Oh, um... yeah, I just, um...

1124
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:21,996
Yeah, I-I just wanted
to let you know

1125
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:23,998
I think you're the most, uh...

1126
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:28,269
...well, you're the most,
uh, b-beautiful girl,

1127
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:29,770
you know, uh,
or whatever, you know.

1128
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:31,572
I was just trying
to see if you...

1129
01:14:31,605 --> 01:14:33,741
Would you please
stop fucking calling here?

1130
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:35,609
I'm working.

1131
01:14:38,746 --> 01:14:40,881
Well, call me tonight, then.

1132
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:45,820
Fine.

1133
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:53,661
To stay or to go?

1134
01:14:53,694 --> 01:14:55,863
Look. The whole sink is gone.

1135
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:57,631
Look at the hole by the shower.

1136
01:14:57,665 --> 01:15:00,634
It wasn't so big at first,

1137
01:15:00,668 --> 01:15:03,637
but more fell down this morning.

1138
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:05,272
All we got left is
the kitchen sink.

1139
01:15:05,306 --> 01:15:09,143
Yeah, I know. I know. I know.

1140
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:11,278
Let me show you the kitchen.

1141
01:15:11,312 --> 01:15:13,247
No, no, uh, I already,
I already saw it.

1142
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,949
Um...

1143
01:15:16,317 --> 01:15:19,887
Inez, this, this is my...
this is my mistake.

1144
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,157
The guys, they thought
this was a full flip,

1145
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,825
like some of the other units,

1146
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:27,294
so I'm happy to have them
come back in and finish up,

1147
01:15:27,328 --> 01:15:29,797
and I won't charge you
anything or...

1148
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,265
Okay, yeah,
just let me know the day.

1149
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:32,767
I can stay home from work

1150
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,568
or Terry could be here
if it's after school.

1151
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:36,270
Well, we'd actually need you to,

1152
01:15:36,303 --> 01:15:37,972
uh, to clear out
of the apartment.

1153
01:15:38,005 --> 01:15:39,807
'Cause there's-there's
just too much damage.

1154
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,009
I mean,
everything's got to get lifted.

1155
01:15:42,043 --> 01:15:43,644
Like how long?

1156
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:46,047
I-I mean, as long as it t--
you know, until it's done.

1157
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,348
A couple months.

1158
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:48,949
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

1159
01:15:48,983 --> 01:15:51,285
-Calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down.

1160
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:52,686
Like two adults, okay?

1161
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,089
There's no reason here
to get loud.

1162
01:15:57,758 --> 01:16:01,695
We have no bathroom,
no shower, Jerry.

1163
01:16:02,363 --> 01:16:04,965
We have no stove, Jerry.

1164
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:07,701
Is-- there's not, like,
a family member

1165
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:09,336
or a friend you could stay with?

1166
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:12,273
Well, this building is too old.

1167
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,008
I come in and fix something,

1168
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:16,944
I got to come back a couple
months later and do it again.

1169
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:19,980
You know, this way,
we come in here,

1170
01:16:20,014 --> 01:16:21,982
we replace everything
all at once.

1171
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:24,685
There's got to be
another option.

1172
01:16:24,718 --> 01:16:26,987
Or you-you could leave.

1173
01:16:31,759 --> 01:16:34,095
My hands are tied.
Give me a call.

1174
01:16:34,128 --> 01:16:36,030
Let me know what you decide.

1175
01:16:41,769 --> 01:16:44,205

1209
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:10,758
I'm sorry.
I know those are your friends.

1210
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:12,993
Is that how you are, too?

1211
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:19,934
You see me here, right?

1212
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:22,836
I'm not here for anybody
trying to make me hate myself.

1213
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:27,441
So how'd you miss
a year of school

1214
01:18:27,474 --> 01:18:29,109
and still end up at Tech?

1215
01:18:29,143 --> 01:18:30,978
You like it?

1216
01:18:32,313 --> 01:18:33,347
It's okay.

1217
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,949
Okay? And? What else?

1218
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:36,850
What don't you like about it?

1219
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:40,487
I don't know.

1220
01:18:40,522 --> 01:18:42,823
Just don't.

1221
01:18:42,856 --> 01:18:45,259
There's nothing wrong
with being smart, you know.

1222
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:47,962
We could use a few more
engineers around here.

1223
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:49,363
I just don't care about
none of that, though.

1224
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:52,066
Okay, so what you want to do?

1225
01:18:52,099 --> 01:18:56,270
Uh, I mean, I like
a lot of things, you know.

1226
01:18:56,303 --> 01:18:58,138
Uh...

1227
01:18:58,172 --> 01:19:01,108
Right now, I'm...
I'm into music.

1228
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:02,876
You want to rap?

1229
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:05,145
Nah. Like...

1230
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,048
Like, uh...

1231
01:19:09,383 --> 01:19:11,118
You-you ever seen <i>The Wiz?</i>

1232
01:19:11,151 --> 01:19:12,386
Yeah.

1233
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:14,822
Yeah, like, stuff like that.

1234
01:19:15,523 --> 01:19:18,259
Um, this Black dude,
uh, Quincy Jones,

1235
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:22,363
he, uh, did the whole score
for the movie, you know.

1236
01:19:22,396 --> 01:19:24,164
Did some other movies, too.

1237
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:27,502
Like a composer.

1238
01:19:27,535 --> 01:19:30,337
Yeah. Yeah.

1239
01:19:32,006 --> 01:19:33,974
PS, I know who Quincy Jones is.

1240
01:19:34,008 --> 01:19:37,011
You should be
in some art school.

1241
01:19:37,044 --> 01:19:39,046
You could go to Juilliard.

1242
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,148
I can help you figure out
what it takes.

1243
01:19:41,181 --> 01:19:43,150
No.

1244
01:19:43,183 --> 01:19:46,020
Kids trying to get in there
have been training for years.

1245
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:48,255
Well, where'd Quincy Jones go?

1246
01:19:51,358 --> 01:19:53,762
He didn't go to school.

1247
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,082
I want to see you again.

1248
01:20:17,451 --> 01:20:19,053
I should be honest with you.

1249
01:20:19,086 --> 01:20:22,990
Um... I'm moving
in a couple weeks.

1250
01:20:23,023 --> 01:20:25,492
To my uncle's in Florida.

1251
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:29,096
This white guy was trying
to help us save the house

1252
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:31,932
but took the deed or something.

1253
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,370
But we can
keep in touch, though.

1254
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:38,372
I'm gonna miss Harlem.

1255
01:20:41,442 --> 01:20:43,010
<i>What's her name?</i>

1256
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:45,279
I don't know
what you talking 'bout.

1257
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:48,616
So who's the girl
I saw you hanging out with?

1258
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,084
Just a girl, Ma.

1259
01:20:50,117 --> 01:20:51,653
Well, is she your girlfriend?

1260
01:20:51,686 --> 01:20:53,220
What...

1261
01:20:53,253 --> 01:20:57,124
Come on. You know I like
Spanish girls, Ma.

1262
01:20:57,157 --> 01:20:58,359
Pardon me?

1263
01:20:58,392 --> 01:21:02,196
What, she look too much like
you for you to take seriously?

1264
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:05,366
You know what, little boy?

1265
01:21:05,399 --> 01:21:07,368
I love you.

1266
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,069
I really do.

1267
01:21:09,103 --> 01:21:11,939
But I'm starting
not to like you anymore.

1268
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:30,558
Now, what's this all about?

1269
01:21:30,592 --> 01:21:33,394
Showing up late,
not handing in your work.

1270
01:21:33,427 --> 01:21:35,496
Something's on your mind.

1271
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:39,166
I said I'm fine.

1272
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:42,169
What's going on with college?
You make a decision yet?

1273
01:21:45,372 --> 01:21:47,241
Daryl?

1274
01:21:50,545 --> 01:21:52,680
-Not yet.
-And why's that?

1275
01:21:52,714 --> 01:21:55,182
You discuss it with your mother?

1276
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:58,252
Yeah.

1277
01:21:58,285 --> 01:21:59,953
A little.

1278
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:06,895
You know this is a safe place.

1279
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:15,469
How have things been at home
since your father got worse?

1280
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:23,343
They, uh... they don't think
he's gonna come home.

1281
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:28,516
I'm sorry to hear that.

1282
01:22:32,486 --> 01:22:37,424
I think the landlord's trying
to push us out or something.

1283
01:22:43,263 --> 01:22:46,300
Do you want to come work
with me at CCA?

1284
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:49,504
I run the after-school program.

1285
01:22:50,605 --> 01:22:53,373
Part-time, a few hours.

1286
01:22:54,676 --> 01:22:56,076
How much it pay?

1287
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:58,445
Enough to help.

1288
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:03,083
You do good, we'll work on
something better this summer.

1289
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:04,719
I don't need
working papers from you

1290
01:23:04,752 --> 01:23:06,086
since you're turning 18 soon.

1291
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:07,421
Just ask your mother

1292
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:09,389
for your birth certificate
and Social, okay?

1293
01:23:19,233 --> 01:23:21,068
Um...

1294
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:23,170
Thank you, Ms. Tucker.

1295
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:25,405
I'm happy to help.

1296
01:23:30,077 --> 01:23:31,613
Yo, Ma?

1297
01:24:26,601 --> 01:24:29,436
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

1298
01:24:29,469 --> 01:24:30,872
Okay, breathe.

1299
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:36,209
Okay, okay. Okay.

1300
01:24:37,879 --> 01:24:41,315
Maybe you should try
and eat some food.

1301
01:24:41,348 --> 01:24:42,717
Yeah?

1302
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,686
-I'm not hungry.
-Okay.

1303
01:24:56,631 --> 01:24:58,700
Why do you love me?

1304
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:02,436
The same reason everybody does.

1305
01:25:05,305 --> 01:25:07,441
That's not an answer.

1306
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:12,513
I want to know why.

1307
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:15,349
You should...

1308
01:25:16,316 --> 01:25:19,654
You should probably stop talking
and get some rest, okay?

1309
01:25:26,961 --> 01:25:30,130
I never really knew
where it came from.

1310
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:36,638
Or whether or not...

1311
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:44,512
...whether or not I deserved it.

1312
01:25:48,415 --> 01:25:50,718
Maybe that's why I never...

1313
01:25:53,387 --> 01:25:56,223
...I never fully gave it back.

1314
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,728
Now I wonder...

1315
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,699
...I wonder if it's too late.

1316
01:26:07,568 --> 01:26:11,539
Damaged people don't know
how to love each other.

1317
01:26:11,572 --> 01:26:13,440
That's all.

1318
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:56,383
T, sit down.

1319
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:59,352
I need to talk to you
about a few things.

1320
01:27:13,634 --> 01:27:14,736
Um...

1321
01:27:15,803 --> 01:27:17,638
Before Lucky got sick,

1322
01:27:17,672 --> 01:27:19,406
we wanted to have a
conversation with you about...

1323
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:21,341
I don't want to talk to you
about Lucky.

1324
01:27:21,374 --> 01:27:22,744
It's not about him.

1325
01:27:22,777 --> 01:27:24,879
Yo, I don't want to talk to you
about anything!

1326
01:27:24,912 --> 01:27:26,881
Yeah?

1327
01:27:27,815 --> 01:27:29,984
Only thing I ever wanted
more than a mother

1328
01:27:30,017 --> 01:27:32,419
was a fucking father!

1329
01:27:38,025 --> 01:27:39,493
Maybe...

1330
01:27:41,428 --> 01:27:43,765
Maybe if you,
if you weren't so hard on him,

1331
01:27:43,798 --> 01:27:45,800
walking around here
so miserable all the time,

1332
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:48,301
he'd still fucking be here.

1333
01:28:00,014 --> 01:28:02,315

This lady over there,

Who is that?

1345
01:29:00,473 --> 01:29:03,343
That's Lucky's daughter
and her mother.

1346
01:29:05,847 --> 01:29:07,615
Make 'em a plate.

1347

Terry!

Ma, what happened?

1354
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:58,032
Come move this stuff!

1355
01:29:58,065 --> 01:30:00,001
One of the pipes!

1356
01:30:00,034 --> 01:30:01,769
I g-- I got it.

1357
01:30:01,802 --> 01:30:03,905
Ma! Yo.

1358
01:30:03,938 --> 01:30:05,806
Come on, come on.

1359
01:30:21,555 --> 01:30:22,890
Sweetheart.

1360
01:30:25,492 --> 01:30:26,928
You seen Javier?

1361
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:28,930
-Who?
-The-the super.

1362
01:30:28,963 --> 01:30:31,899
Oh, um, not since yesterday.

1363
01:30:31,933 --> 01:30:33,067
Sorry.

1364
01:30:43,844 --> 01:30:45,913
Daryl, we need to talk.

1365
01:30:45,947 --> 01:30:48,082
Your paperwork was denied.

1366
01:30:48,115 --> 01:30:49,684
What?

1367
01:30:50,584 --> 01:30:52,853
The Social Security number
you gave me isn't valid.

1368
01:30:52,887 --> 01:30:55,156
I'm glad I caught it
before somebody else did.

1369
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:57,124
I-I forgot.

1370
01:30:57,158 --> 01:30:59,160
It-it expired.

1371
01:30:59,193 --> 01:31:01,595
That's not how it works.

1372
01:31:01,629 --> 01:31:05,766
So, then wh-- that mean, like,
I don't get the job or...

1373
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,069
Well, before I can even
look into any of that,

1374
01:31:08,102 --> 01:31:11,973
we need to sort out how
you ended up with phony papers.

1375
01:31:12,006 --> 01:31:13,874
Did you really ask your mom?

1376
01:31:16,811 --> 01:31:19,580
Sh-She don't,
she don't have 'em.

1377
01:31:20,214 --> 01:31:21,882
You're from here, right?

1378
01:31:22,783 --> 01:31:25,786
-Wh-What you mean?
-Born in the States.

1379
01:31:26,821 --> 01:31:28,522
Uh, y-yeah.

1380
01:31:28,556 --> 01:31:30,591
Nah, yeah, yeah.

1381
01:31:30,624 --> 01:31:33,995
Well... this could mean
a lot of hell for you.

1382
01:31:34,028 --> 01:31:35,997
To get a job, to-to do anything.

1383
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:40,267
I mean, it's still probably,
you know, like, with the city.

1384
01:31:40,301 --> 01:31:42,770
Fr-From when
I was in foster care.

1385
01:31:44,872 --> 01:31:46,040
Hmm.

1386
01:31:49,877 --> 01:31:52,713
Oh, I have a friend down in
Social Services who can help.

1387
01:31:52,747 --> 01:31:54,281
No, no, it's cool,
it's cool, it's cool.

1388
01:31:54,315 --> 01:31:55,649
It's-it's all good.
It's all good.

1389
01:31:55,683 --> 01:31:57,018
We just-- It's all good.

1390
01:31:57,051 --> 01:31:59,286
Hey, Janice.

1391
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,155
Listen, I need a favor.
I have a student here

1392
01:32:01,188 --> 01:32:02,289
-whose paperwork is...
-Hey, no, no.

1393
01:32:02,323 --> 01:32:04,992
Hey, yo-yo, Ms. Tucker, come on!

1394
01:32:07,261 --> 01:32:08,896
It's all, it's all good.

1395
01:32:11,799 --> 01:32:12,933
Um...

1396
01:32:15,036 --> 01:32:18,105
Uh, they don't, they don't know
I'm-I'm with my mother.

1397
01:32:18,139 --> 01:32:19,840
-You know?
-And why is that?

1398
01:32:19,874 --> 01:32:21,075
Who are you supposed to be with?

1399
01:32:21,108 --> 01:32:22,910
Um...

1400
01:32:22,943 --> 01:32:25,079
Have you told anyone else
about this?

1401
01:32:26,947 --> 01:32:29,950
-Nah.
-Is Daryl your real name?

1402
01:32:31,085 --> 01:32:35,056
If you lied on your college
applications, it's a felony.

1403
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:36,791
It's Terry!

1404
01:32:43,631 --> 01:32:45,966
It's-it's T--
it's Terry Wallace.

1405
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:52,706
How long ago did this happen?

1406
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:58,612
When-when I was little.

1407
01:32:59,747 --> 01:33:01,816
I was a social worker for years.

1408
01:33:01,849 --> 01:33:03,951
If the city
didn't want to give you back,

1409
01:33:03,984 --> 01:33:06,087
it's likely because
something happened.

1410
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:09,356
Regardless of what, you are
still a ward of the state.

1411
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:11,792
By law, I have to report this.

1412
01:33:11,826 --> 01:33:13,828
Oh, do-do... do any of that
even matter, though?

1413
01:33:13,861 --> 01:33:16,730
Um, you know, I'm finna be 18
in a few weeks, you know, so...

1414
01:33:16,764 --> 01:33:18,933
I can't keep this to myself.

1415
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:21,035
I have to speak with
your mother.

1416
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,348
Can-can I talk to you?

1417
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:36,984
It'd be nicer if you could help.

1418
01:33:37,017 --> 01:33:37,918
What happened?

1419
01:33:37,952 --> 01:33:39,787
What does it look like, Terry?

1420
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:43,124
Called the super ten times
since yesterday.

1421
01:33:44,024 --> 01:33:45,793
It's about the job
with Ms. Tucker.

1422
01:33:45,826 --> 01:33:48,662
Sh-She, um, sh-she want
my birth certificate

1423
01:33:48,696 --> 01:33:49,730
and my Social.

1424
01:33:49,763 --> 01:33:51,265
The real one.

1425
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:53,000
What do you mean, the real one?

1426
01:33:53,033 --> 01:33:55,035
Um, the papers I found in your
room, they-they didn't work.

1427
01:33:55,069 --> 01:33:56,770
What do you mean, the papers
you found in my room?

1428
01:33:56,804 --> 01:33:58,706
You went through my stuff?
Why wouldn't you ask me?

1429
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:00,774
I didn't know I had to!

1430
01:34:01,742 --> 01:34:05,079
She want to come by tomorrow
evening and talk to you.

1431
01:34:05,112 --> 01:34:06,780
For what?

1432
01:34:06,814 --> 01:34:09,049
Well, I-I mean, I don't know.
What was I supposed to say?

1433
01:34:15,789 --> 01:34:18,959
I don't know how the hell
we gonna get ahold of those.

1434
01:34:24,165 --> 01:34:26,066
Come with me outside. I...

1435
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:28,769
I need to smoke.

1436
01:34:29,403 --> 01:34:31,338
Starting to smell in here.

1437
01:34:44,418 --> 01:34:46,820
You wanted to leave me.

1438
01:34:48,989 --> 01:34:50,224
No.

1439
01:34:51,492 --> 01:34:53,127
No, Ma.

1440
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,729
Why would you say
something like that?

1441
01:34:57,765 --> 01:34:59,800
Forget it.

1442
01:35:03,505 --> 01:35:05,773
What time
your teacher coming tomorrow?

1443
01:35:05,806 --> 01:35:07,441
Around 6:00 or something.

1444
01:35:07,474 --> 01:35:09,076
I think.

1445
01:35:16,884 --> 01:35:19,220
T, you should probably see
if you can, um,

1446
01:35:19,253 --> 01:35:21,523
stay with Pea and Miss Annie
a little while,

1447
01:35:21,556 --> 01:35:24,792
till they finish
working on the apartment.

1448
01:35:29,263 --> 01:35:31,332
Where you gonna go?

1449
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:35,002
I'll figure it out.

1450
01:35:36,971 --> 01:35:39,273
I'll go to your school tomorrow

1451
01:35:39,306 --> 01:35:41,809
and get everything
straightened out with, um,

1452
01:35:41,842 --> 01:35:43,911
Ms. What's-Her-Face.

1453
01:36:02,296 --> 01:36:03,831
Yo, Ma?

1454
01:36:14,441 --> 01:36:17,545
Yo, hey, Titi. What's up?

1455
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:19,280
Um...

1456
01:36:19,313 --> 01:36:22,082
Yeah, you, um, you heard
from my mother yet?

1457
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:29,524
Nah, y-- I been, um, I-I been
trying to call her all morning.

1458
01:36:29,557 --> 01:36:31,925
No, she, um...

1459
01:36:31,959 --> 01:36:34,161
Yeah, just, um...

1460
01:36:35,229 --> 01:36:38,799
Yeah, just give me
a-a call back when-when you do.

1461
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:47,609
H-Hey, y-yeah.

1462
01:36:47,642 --> 01:36:49,143
Yeah, Aunt Kim. H-Hold on.

1463
01:36:49,176 --> 01:36:51,613
Let me, uh...
hey, no, let me, uh,

1464
01:36:51,646 --> 01:36:54,081
let me give you a call back.

1465
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,186
Hi, Terrance.

1466
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:01,288
Is your mother home?

1467
01:37:01,322 --> 01:37:02,590
Um...

1468
01:37:02,624 --> 01:37:05,326
Uh, n-no.

1469
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:07,995
She left for work already?

1470
01:37:08,028 --> 01:37:10,898
Yeah, uh... I think so.

1471
01:37:14,068 --> 01:37:18,138
Do you mind if we come in
and talk for a bit?

1472
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:19,873
Uh...

1473
01:37:19,907 --> 01:37:21,643
Y-Yeah.
I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1474
01:37:21,676 --> 01:37:24,646
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1475
01:37:24,679 --> 01:37:27,348
-Uh, this is Anne.
-Hey.

1476
01:37:27,381 --> 01:37:31,619
And this is Officer Philips,
Officer Russo.

1477
01:37:31,653 --> 01:37:33,887
May we have a seat?

1478
01:37:34,488 --> 01:37:36,924
How long ago did she leave?

1479
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:40,127
Yesterday evening.

1480
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,930
What was
the last thing she said to you?

1481
01:37:42,963 --> 01:37:45,232
Did she say anything
out of the ordinary?

1482
01:37:45,265 --> 01:37:47,401
Anything unusual?

1483
01:37:47,434 --> 01:37:49,637
W-Well...

1484
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,004
not that I remember.

1485
01:37:51,038 --> 01:37:53,941
Uh, everything seemed fine.

1486
01:37:53,974 --> 01:37:55,376
Excuse me, sir,
could you, could you,

1487
01:37:55,409 --> 01:37:58,078
could y'all, you know,
not go through all our stuff?

1488
01:37:58,112 --> 01:38:00,981
Terrance, we really need
your cooperation on this.

1489
01:38:01,014 --> 01:38:02,650
Uh, she-she, like, gonna
get in trouble or something?

1490
01:38:02,684 --> 01:38:06,086
You know, 'cause, I mean, you
know, why does it even matter?

1491
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,056
I mean, you know,
I'm almost 18, you know, so...

1492
01:38:10,457 --> 01:38:12,259
Um...

1493
01:38:12,292 --> 01:38:14,094
Well, about that.

1494
01:38:15,295 --> 01:38:19,199
It's difficult for me to say
what I have to say right now.

1495
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:24,171
Inez...

1496
01:38:24,204 --> 01:38:27,074
is not your biological mother.

1497
01:38:30,477 --> 01:38:32,246
Uh...

1498
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:34,415
Like some joke or something?

1499
01:38:34,448 --> 01:38:36,950
No, it's not.

1500
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:45,325
This is the woman
who abducted you.

1501
01:38:47,562 --> 01:38:51,498
Whatever story she told you was
just a lie that she cooked up.

1502
01:38:52,466 --> 01:38:56,203
I am so sorry
you have to find out like this.

1503
01:38:56,236 --> 01:38:58,338
Are you sure
you don't know where she is?

1504
01:38:58,372 --> 01:39:00,140
Any ideas at all?

1505
01:39:01,108 --> 01:39:03,410
Give him some room, please.

1506
01:39:04,579 --> 01:39:06,146
For now, we need to focus on

1507
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:09,016
what's best for Terry
moving forward.

1508
01:39:09,049 --> 01:39:10,451
What's best for me?

1509
01:39:10,484 --> 01:39:13,187
He doesn't have any known
relatives that we can trust.

1510
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:14,622
That's all right.

1511
01:39:14,656 --> 01:39:18,292
We can place him at Sheltering
Arms for the time being.

1512
01:39:18,325 --> 01:39:20,628
It's a family services program.
It's...

1513
01:39:20,662 --> 01:39:22,062
I know what it is.

1514
01:39:22,095 --> 01:39:23,263
Just for a couple of weeks,

1515
01:39:23,297 --> 01:39:26,133
until we can navigate
next steps.

1516
01:39:29,504 --> 01:39:31,472
If that's all right with you.

1517
01:39:32,774 --> 01:39:34,341
I don't know if your parents

1518
01:39:34,374 --> 01:39:37,978
are still on the street,
but we can work on that.

1519
01:39:39,346 --> 01:39:42,149
Everything was
such a mess back then.

1520
01:39:43,383 --> 01:39:47,120
In my office, the only record
you had on some kids was...

1521
01:39:48,088 --> 01:39:50,290
...just an index card.

1522
01:39:57,364 --> 01:39:59,501
Hello?

1523
01:39:59,534 --> 01:40:01,068
Terry, is that you?

1524
01:40:01,101 --> 01:40:03,605
Yeah. Y-- Titi.

1525
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,406
I stopped by the group home,

1526
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,208
but nobody seems to know
where you are.

1527
01:40:08,242 --> 01:40:10,512
I'm-I'm at, I'm at a pay phone.

1528
01:40:10,545 --> 01:40:12,514
I-I can't stay there.

1529
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:14,749
You want to meet me back here?

1530
01:40:14,782 --> 01:40:17,384
I want you to come stay with me.

1531
01:40:17,417 --> 01:40:19,386
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1532
01:40:19,419 --> 01:40:21,723
I think you should
stop by the house first,

1533
01:40:21,756 --> 01:40:26,126
pick up any last things you
might want to take with you.

1534
01:40:27,394 --> 01:40:28,630
Yeah.

1535
01:40:28,663 --> 01:40:30,397
I'll see you soon, baby.

1536
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:32,165
Okay.

1537
01:40:33,501 --> 01:40:35,335
Okay.

1538
01:41:09,369 --> 01:41:10,772
Ma?

1539
01:41:10,805 --> 01:41:12,406
Hey, Terry.

1540
01:41:16,911 --> 01:41:19,781
What you, what you,
what you doing?

1541
01:41:19,814 --> 01:41:21,616
I left some things.

1542
01:41:21,649 --> 01:41:23,685
Look, don't stand over there
looking over me.

1543
01:41:23,718 --> 01:41:27,522
I'm sure they already got to
you, so feel free to run along.

1544
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:33,460
Can we, can we talk, though?

1545
01:41:33,493 --> 01:41:35,630
Talk about what?

1546
01:41:35,663 --> 01:41:38,398
You serious right now?

1547
01:41:39,867 --> 01:41:41,168
Fine.

1548
01:41:41,201 --> 01:41:43,605
You want to talk, let's talk.

1549
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:53,881
Fetch me my Newports.

1550
01:41:54,782 --> 01:41:58,352
-You was just over there...
-Over on the stand.

1551
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:13,701
What you want me to say?

1552
01:42:13,735 --> 01:42:15,637
That I fucked up?

1553
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:17,170
Yeah, T, I fucked up.

1554
01:42:17,204 --> 01:42:18,438
But life goes on. So what?

1555
01:42:18,472 --> 01:42:20,440
Well, as long as
it's your call, right?

1556
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:21,909
Who was the one
who made the choice,

1557
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:23,276
standing in that hospital?
Was it you or me?

1558
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:24,512
Thinking you was
my fucking mother!

1559
01:42:24,545 --> 01:42:26,246
Lower your fucking tone!

1560
01:42:26,279 --> 01:42:29,282
You better watch
how the fuck you talking to me.

1561
01:42:30,885 --> 01:42:32,553
Did Lucky know?

1562
01:42:37,759 --> 01:42:40,160
Yes, he knew.

1563
01:42:41,261 --> 01:42:43,665
He didn't agree with it,
but he knew.

1564
01:42:44,799 --> 01:42:47,467
Why? Why you do it?

1565
01:42:52,372 --> 01:42:54,341
I don't know why I did it, T.

1566
01:42:54,374 --> 01:42:57,277
It was something small that
turned into something else.

1567
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:58,880
And that's supposed to make it
right or something?

1568
01:42:58,913 --> 01:43:01,949
Who made you the chief
of right or wrong?

1569
01:43:01,983 --> 01:43:03,985
You don't think
I have feelings, too?!

1570
01:43:04,018 --> 01:43:05,586
After all those years
I took care of you,

1571
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:07,555
who the fuck was there
to take care of me?!

1572
01:43:07,588 --> 01:43:11,358
I stood up for everybody else!
What the fuck was it for?!

1573
01:43:11,391 --> 01:43:12,827
Every chance you had,

1574
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:15,830
every chance you had,
you turned your back on me!

1575
01:43:15,863 --> 01:43:17,699
-That's not true.
-Oh, please.

1576
01:43:17,732 --> 01:43:19,567
Nobody else give a shit
about Black women

1577
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,737
except for other Black women,
and even that shit get messy.

1578
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:31,779
Who heard me when I was hurt?

1579
01:43:33,346 --> 01:43:35,717
It wasn't you.

1580
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:38,019
And it damn sure wasn't Lucky.

1581
01:43:38,052 --> 01:43:40,722
But you were my mother!

1582
01:43:40,755 --> 01:43:42,255
Hmm?

1583
01:43:42,289 --> 01:43:44,592
Now, how am I supposed to feel?

1584
01:44:03,511 --> 01:44:06,246
I need to know what was real.

1585
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,830
I never left you on that corner.

1586
01:44:25,933 --> 01:44:28,703
I was the one that found you.

1587
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:36,644
Little two-year-old running
around outside the shelter.

1588
01:44:39,781 --> 01:44:44,351
I waited outside on that block
for hours with you.

1589
01:44:45,586 --> 01:44:48,856
Waiting for anybody to show up.

1590
01:44:49,824 --> 01:44:52,827
I saw so much of myself.

1591
01:44:55,897 --> 01:45:00,300
I just... I just wanted
to look out for you.

1592
01:45:01,636 --> 01:45:04,839
I didn't want you
getting chewed up like I was.

1593
01:45:05,873 --> 01:45:09,076
I seen somebody who needed me.

1594
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:11,078
But...

1595
01:45:11,112 --> 01:45:14,582
But maybe I'm the one
who needed you.

1596
01:45:14,615 --> 01:45:17,585
And, T, for that, I'm sorry.

1597
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:20,755
I'm-I'm sorry.

1598
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:27,662
I tried to change.

1599
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:31,899
But I don't, I don't want it.

1600
01:45:31,933 --> 01:45:33,768
I don't want this.

1601
01:45:34,702 --> 01:45:38,739
Not if...
not if it's built on a lie.

1602
01:45:39,707 --> 01:45:42,442
Not if being loved by you
or anybody else

1603
01:45:42,475 --> 01:45:45,345
means not loving myself.

1604
01:45:46,714 --> 01:45:49,083
They not gonna let you
get away with it.

1605
01:45:49,116 --> 01:45:50,685
I ain't going to jail.

1606
01:45:50,718 --> 01:45:53,721
I already know what the fuck
they gonna say anyway.

1607
01:45:53,754 --> 01:45:54,589
Already know.

1608
01:45:54,622 --> 01:45:57,490
And guess what.
I don't give a fuck.

1609
01:45:57,525 --> 01:45:59,527
Because I still won.

1610
01:46:00,695 --> 01:46:01,963
I won.

1611
01:46:02,897 --> 01:46:05,900
Because I know you gonna
grow up to be somebody.

1612
01:46:11,505 --> 01:46:13,708
I wish I didn't know.

1613
01:46:15,176 --> 01:46:17,612
I wish, I wish
you could've did a better job

1614
01:46:17,645 --> 01:46:20,413
of keeping that lie to yourself.

1615
01:46:20,447 --> 01:46:21,716
I wish it could've continued

1616
01:46:21,749 --> 01:46:24,652
so that we could've continued,
and I...

1617
01:46:26,921 --> 01:46:29,489
...I wish I knew
how to be better to you

1618
01:46:29,523 --> 01:46:32,560
so you didn't feel like
you had to leave me alone.

1619
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:37,865
'Cause I'm scared.

1620
01:46:40,201 --> 01:46:44,005
I'm scared that
I won't have no home no more.

1621
01:46:44,972 --> 01:46:46,507
And one day I'm gonna show up

1622
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:49,644
and it's gonna feel like
we ain't never happened.

1623
01:46:50,878 --> 01:46:52,479
Ma!

1624
01:46:52,513 --> 01:46:55,549
Like this wasn't
our living room?

1625
01:46:56,951 --> 01:46:58,753
Our home?

1626
01:47:02,489 --> 01:47:04,692
I miss my bed, Ma.

1627
01:47:09,496 --> 01:47:11,832
The one that you made for me.

1628
01:47:21,108 --> 01:47:23,811
Where's home for me now?

1629
01:49:38,112 --> 01:49:39,947
This isn't goodbye.

1630
01:49:41,982 --> 01:49:43,350
I promise.

1631
01:49:43,384 --> 01:49:45,119
This isn't goodbye, T.

1632
01:49:46,987 --> 01:49:48,756
I promise.

1633
01:49:54,261 --> 01:49:56,664
I love you, Ma.

1634
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:01,702
I love you.

1635
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:08,075
I think you should go.

1636
01:51:07,468 --> 01:51:10,738
Okay, miss. Where to?
