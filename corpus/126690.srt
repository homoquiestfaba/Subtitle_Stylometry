1
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,891
"It was the late seventies,"

2
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,587
and Everybody was in the middle of it

3
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,358
"The recession, the mile-Iong lines
to the station"

4
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,423
The hostage crisis in Iran

5
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,996
"When I look back at it now,"

6
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,003
it is amazing I can remeber any of it

7
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,031
It feels like snap-shots from
someone else's life

8
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,734
All connected by one man...

9
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,341
"A guy named Steve Rubell,"

10
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,748
...had a dream...

11
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,413
to throw the best damn party
the world had ever seen

12
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,847
And to make it last forever

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,882
He built a world that was offered up
as reality

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,295
Where an eighty year old Disco Queen
could play until dawn

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,923
"Where models mingled with mechanics,"

16
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,796
...plumbers danced with princes

17
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,399
It was a place where all labels
were left behind

18
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,399
A place where there were no rules

19
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,950
In 1979 I was nineteen years old

20
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,088
And I had nothing

21
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,554
"Now my Dad would say I had more
than he did at my age,"

22
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,563
but you know what?

23
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,689
"To me,"

24
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,131
filling gas tanks at a
Jersey City station...

25
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,159
"going to the same dingy bar,
with the same guys"

26
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,933
"trying to pick-up on the same chicks,"

27
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,302
...was not tons of fun

28
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,350
I can't believe you came already!

29
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,316
Sorry

30
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,446
I'm sorry

31
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,921
It was just an...

32
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,824
Look at you! You're so...

33
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,295
Oh yeah...you want to go out tomorrow?

34
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,197
"Look, I know this place where the
pizza is dynamite"

35
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,464
What?

36
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,561
"I'm from Montana, right?"

37
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,366
And you are from Jersey city?

38
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,736
Yeah

39
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,343
So...I don't go out with guys
from Jersey city

40
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,444
I knew the real escape was right across
the river

41
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,885
But I didn't even have a car

42
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,012
"Even though New York was
three miles away,"

43
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,750
...it seemed like another world

44
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,116
I had been there before with my Mom

45
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,288
"She did makeup for this television show,"

46
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,762
...and took me to work a few times

47
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,398
It was incredible

48
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,525
Everyone wanted to be around the stars

49
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,093
"My mother always told me I could be
anything I wanted to be,"

50
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,696
and I believed her

51
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,610
Mom died when I was twelve

52
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,245
This was dad...

53
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,980
"...his idea of the good life was,"

54
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,985
"a can of "Schlitz" and a
"Jack Benny Special" on the tube"

55
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,048
I had to break out

56
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,387
I knew I had to make a change

57
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,288
"Alright, alright, alright"

58
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,334
What!

59
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,630
What you laughing at?

60
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,499
What is with the hair?

61
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,435
Look at this guy!

62
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,301
Where is my hair?

63
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,805
Look at this guy!

64
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,069
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,770
You look like Vidal Sassoon

66
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,571
"If YOU don't look good,
we don't look good!"

67
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:54,594
"Shit, I should have borrowed
my brother's platforms"

68
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,660
Do I look short?

69
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:04,006
"Hey you guys, you guys"

70
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,279
Before we go in. Check it out

71
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,348
Oh take me home baby!

72
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,248
"That is Julie Black from
"All of my Children""

73
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,479
She is my fucking dream girl

74
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,146
"Julie Black, she is from Alpine"

75
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,246
My aunt does her ma's hair

76
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,483
"Saw her once too,"

77
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,512
...hanging out at the Alpine Inn

78
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,183
Alpine Inn?

79
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,351
Yeah

80
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,655
We should stake her out

81
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,420
Where was this taken anyway

82
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,624
54

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,497
You know Studio 54

84
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,796
Have you never heard of it?

85
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,393
That place is full of freaks

86
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,438
And girls

87
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,404
And fags

88
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,804
Come on you guys

89
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,069
"Listen, you know who was there
last night?"

90
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,843
Jacqueline Bissette

91
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,038
You know who she is?

92
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,512
Yeah I fucked her

93
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,007
"Alright, you turkeys can stay here,"

94
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,177
and rot for all I care

95
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,584
But I'm going to go see if I can
get a look at Olivia

96
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,122
Olivia Newton-John?

97
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,650
We aren't there yet?

98
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,662
Fuck you Jersey!

99
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,608
We will save you a place in line!

100
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,340
You mothers!

101
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,208
You are going to leave me
with these freaks!

102
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,560
Hey! Hey!

103
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,422
A lot of people thought the door was
a better show than inside

104
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,995
People would try anything to get in

105
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,529
"Mark was the doorman,"

106
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,366
but it was Steve Rubell's club

107
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,406
And his door

108
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,770
I can't let you in here

109
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,241
You are wearing an ascot

110
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,743
You look like an asshole

111
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,606
"He was out in front, every night,
making sure only the right people got in"

112
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:49,778
Go home

113
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,680
No. No...

114
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,912
Hey come on!

115
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,615
Over there. Yeah

116
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,859
Excuse me! He just pointed at me!

117
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,021
Just you

118
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,361
Say what?

119
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,729
"Just you, not him"

120
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,859
"Hey man, these are my friends,"

121
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:10,300
you can't...

122
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,774
"Girls...Stand back, please"

123
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,208
Oh my God...

124
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,712
"Don't be a spaz man, go for it"

125
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,679
"Alright, don't wait for me"

126
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,737
I will find my own way home

127
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,044
"Okay you guys, come on"

128
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,858
"Get your fucking hands off me,
you jive-ass turkey!"

129
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:36,894
Sorry guy...

130
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,365
What?

131
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,730
Not with that shirt

132
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,563
Hey!

133
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,164
I said...not with that shirt

134
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,225
"Welcome to my party, handsome"

135
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,027
He choose me

136
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,231
I had never been chosen for
anything before

137
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,575
"You want to check that body, sugar?"

138
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,998
"Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all?"

139
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,473
"Truman? Truman Capote, Where are you?"

140
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,676
Here sugar!

141
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,303
There you are

142
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,610
In honor of your fantastic new
face lift...

143
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,311
I thought I would get you
a couple of things

144
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,262
"And to make sure, the lift sticks"

145
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,708
"I thought we should all...
"Knock on Wood""

146
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:33,531
Oh Yeah!

147
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:40,199
"I don't want to lose, this good thing
...that I have got"

148
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:47,144
Because if I do...I would surely...
surely lose a lot

149
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:54,108
Because your love...is better...
than anything I know!

150
00:10:54,153 --> 00:11:00,888
It's like thunder! Lightning!
The way you love me is frightening

151
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:19,608
ck...on wood! I said I better knock, knock on...oh baby...yes

152
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:25,747
Like thunder! Lightning!

153
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,219
The way you love me is frightening!

154
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:49,871
knock, knock on wood! Yeah baby! I better knock on wood

155
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,809
"The thing about stars is, they are short"

156
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,185
Did you talk to any of them?

157
00:11:59,186 --> 00:11:59,776
Kind of...

158
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,751
Who?

159
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,614
"Well, like...I don't know"

160
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,589
But you should have seen
the photographers

161
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,319
I will bet you I even got in
one of their pictures

162
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,849
Do you think Farrah ever goes there?

163
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,758
Maybe

164
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,727
And Lee Majors?

165
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,889
Probably

166
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,364
What about Princess Grace?

167
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,860
"Sure, I bet she goes all the time"

168
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,265
Really?

169
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,735
Maybe we can touch her when she goes by

170
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,304
I told her mom named us after her

171
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,065
Hey kids

172
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:20,969
Hey dad

173
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,134
Hey squirt

174
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,576
"Hey dad, can I borrow the keys tonight?"

175
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,544
What for?

176
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,774
Shane was in city last night

177
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,213
And he wants to go back

178
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,148
The City?

179
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,347
Yeah Shane was just telling us how he
went to studio 54 last night

180
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,912
Studio 54

181
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,424
That is that big disco everybody is
talking about

182
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,618
Where all the stars go

183
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,887
"Yeah Dad, you should have seen it"

184
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,861
"Hey I saw a star once, Bob Hope!"

185
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,227
You see him there?

186
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,930
"Thanks for the memories Dad,
but it wasn't a Korean war show"

187
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,346
"What else, Shane?"

188
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,008
Well I went up into the balcony

189
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,516
It was pretty...

190
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,452
It was pretty dark

191
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,354
"The girl who cut my hair,"

192
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,366
"had this boyfriend, whose sister did
the books for Steve Rubell"

193
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,890
...and got me an interview

194
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,303
Steve Rubell...a regular Booklyn kid

195
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,772
"who got his start by running
a few steak houses,"

196
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,632
...and now on top of the world

197
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,977
He's gorgeous

198
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,980
"Gorgeous, see for yourself"

199
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,546
I was warned that Steve didn't hire
any dummies

200
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,881
And I should be on my toes

201
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,818
because he could ask some really
tricky questions

202
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,711
What is two plus two?

203
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:17,619
Huh?

204
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,918
You will be fine

205
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,318
"You are right, he is gorgeous"

206
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,323
Come on in!

207
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,831
"Where do bad little bartenders go,
if they don't go to Hell first?"

208
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,163
Xenon

209
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,997
Right. A fate worse than death

210
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,505
"So, as of tonight"

211
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,233
The new bartender will be...

212
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,372
Rhett

213
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,340
Choice

214
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,472
Oh and we got a new busboy

215
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,378
His name is Shane

216
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,179
"Shane! Shane, come here. Come here"

217
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,054
I couldn't find the right size

218
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,883
And remember

219
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:00,331
It is you boys who are truly
New York's finest

220
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,402
One Chablis! Hey kid!

221
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,472
Chablis

222
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,242
So what will it be?

223
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,607
What will it be?!

224
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,915
"Where did they get you "Rocky?"
Philadelphia?"

225
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,679
"No talking to the animals, busboy"

226
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,249
Hang in there baby

227
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,983
"Greg man, will you help me please"

228
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,190
This is how it works

229
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,594
Keep the bottles and the glasses
off the dance floor

230
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,121
Keep the champagne cold and
keep it flowing

231
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,526
You got to pay attention
to the V.I.P. area

232
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,002
Steve doesn't want them to ever pour
champagne for themselves

233
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,466
"Now, listen up..."

234
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,066
"After everybody is all gone,
check the banquettes"

235
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,112
We usually find some pretty good stuff

236
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,437
Is that Julie Black?

237
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,749
I think so. Are you ready?

238
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,679
There she was. Julie Black

239
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,684
"Man, she looked even better in person
than on TV"

240
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,593
She was from Jersey too
and she had made it

241
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,330
I really got to get out of here
and get some sleep

242
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,907
Stevie knew that we had no royalty
in this country

243
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,272
"We had celebrity and,"

244
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,767
"if he could provide opportunity for
regular people to dance with the famous,"

245
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,336
...The Studio would be one of a kind

246
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,979
And I was such a dumb kid

247
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,506
"All these famous people,"

248
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,677
and I didn't know who any of them were

249
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,879
"And they would all go,"

250
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,353
"Truman, Oh Truman"

251
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,050
"And I would be thinking,
who the fuck is Truman?"

252
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,422
Hey Fiorucci! How are you?

253
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,951
I'm such a big fan of yours

254
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,486
The windows are great. Fabulous!

255
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,660
"You are so Italian, and adorable,"

256
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,933
"I want to eat you with a spoon, come"

257
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,401
Come with me

258
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,003
I would say it was this big. At least

259
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,093
Did you get his number?

260
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,403
It ain't the size of the ship
It is the motion of the ocean

261
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,706
Did your mother teach you that?

262
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,937
His father

263
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,269
It sounds kind of defensive to me

264
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,304
I think we are freaking the new kid out

265
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,142
Hey how did you do tonight?

266
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,078
Good. I made quite a bit

267
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,610
He doesn't mean your tips

268
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,646
You went up to the balcony with Patty?

269
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,286
The word gets around fast I guess

270
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,687
So did she do the accent?

271
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,328
So how was she?

272
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,960
Really great

273
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,560
She is a model

274
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,898
Really?

275
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,560
Have we seen her in anything?

276
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,571
Yeah Vogue. French Vogue

277
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,805
She is moving on up

278
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,139
"She told me "Cosmo""

279
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,643
She told me Women's Wear Daily

280
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,612
Hey I don't care if it was
Sears & Roebucks. It was hot

281
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,638
She told you Women's Wear Daily?

282
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,945
Stop

283
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,911
"Oh, I feel a fight coming on"

284
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,819
No way sister

285
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,788
And the extra plate

286
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,462
Hey don't take anything until everybody
puts their stuff down

287
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,991
Didn't you get anything?

288
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,761
Oh wait

289
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,807
Hello friend

290
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,280
Sometimes you meet people and right away
they feel like family

291
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,057
That is how it was with Greg and Anita

292
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,917
She wanted to be the next Donna Summer

293
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,859
"Greg wanted to get ahead,"

294
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,193
...just wasn't sure how

295
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,495
Looks like your wedding was dynamite!

296
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,429
Oh put these away

297
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,064
Anita's studio

298
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,075
Far out. What is this?

299
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,971
"Oh these are just for motivation,"

300
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,914
like when you put a picture of
a fat person on the fridge

301
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,143
So play me something

302
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,378
"Yeah, she is unbelievable"

303
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,077
Play him something

304
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,021
"No, no I'm really tired. I'm really,
really tired"

305
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,684
I have been screaming all night

306
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,585
Okay I will play something simple

307
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,572
I can't do this

308
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,600
That was excellent

309
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,342
"No, it wasn't"

310
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,237
"Shane, follow me"

311
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,847
This place is bad man

312
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,621
You can stay as long as you want

313
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,581
Really?

314
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,485
Mi casa e su casa

315
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,393
In mi casa there are three basic
food groups

316
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,925
"Solids, liquids and hot smoke"

317
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:25,875
What will it be? What will it be?

318
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,612
Can I help you? Yeah. Can I help you?

319
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:36,089
I am looking for American foxes
with big American breasts!

320
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,761
I couldn't believe all the shit Greg
told me what was going on at the club

321
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,726
Bartenders. They had it made

322
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,259
"Drugs, Sex, Connections, Money"

323
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,601
There was an endless supply coming
across the bar

324
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,240
"Greg told me, half way through the night"

325
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,072
Steve had the bartenders...dump the cash

326
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,407
"Send it downstairs and,"

327
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,707
change the tape in the registers

328
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,681
It was a skim job straight out of
the Vegas Casinos

329
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,581
And Steve Rubell was making
a fortune off of it

330
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,516
Greg was on garbage detail

331
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,522
Anthony?

332
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,921
He would take it out the back door

333
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,925
and give it to this guy Anthony
he called the garbage man

334
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,449
Hey pisanno!

335
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,854
How you doing?

336
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,125
"I really scored, didn't I?"

337
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,257
Greg told me everything

338
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:19,862
"Alright cowgirl, put that on there
Easy, easy..."

339
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:22,905
Is it all there?

340
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,306
"Yeah, count it"

341
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,111
"How much they pay you to wait around
for me, huh kid?"

342
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,572
Enough

343
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:29,710
"Yeah, you are Italian right?"

344
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,976
Right on

345
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,485
"You ever need to increase your paycheck,
you come to me"

346
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,783
I got the best party favors in the place

347
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,524
Oh yeah!

348
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,927
Greg...Take it

349
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:52,594
But I have to...

350
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,072
Give it to him. Come on!

351
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:01,711
You have never seen my palace...

352
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,061
Empty it

353
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,159
Go ahead...

354
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:58,033
"Rhett the brand new bartender, quit"

355
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,095
He thinks he is going to model

356
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,033
Really?

357
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:07,545
"Yeah, he met Scavullo"

358
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,876
And thinks he has got it made

359
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,183
You are a handsome guy

360
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,187
I bet you could model...

361
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,985
if you were a little taller

362
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,797
It is a new world out there

363
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:40,870
Old labels and prejudice
don't apply anymore

364
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,075
Right

365
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,307
Right

366
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,879
You do a special job for us

367
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,112
Important

368
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,920
Before you...

369
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,719
I only let bartenders deal with Anthony

370
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,590
But Viv trusts you

371
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,596
"It is a good job, I take it seriously"

372
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,926
She also says you are married to Anita

373
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,099
And that you never go with
the other boys

374
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,336
Yeah. I mean no

375
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,434
I'm not gay

376
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,605
Labels

377
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,239
"I'm sorry I forgot, Mister Rubell"

378
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:24,711
"Mister! Oh, that's good"

379
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,660
Well you know what? I'm not gay either

380
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,962
I want to suck your cock

381
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,106
I'm married

382
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,576
"No one gets married at your age,"

383
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,842
unless you are trying to prove something

384
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,747
"I have to go, sorry..."

385
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,220
Bartenders make a lot of this

386
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,025
I know

387
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,421
Come here

388
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,996
Come here

389
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,092
I can't

390
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,426
I'm married and she is waiting

391
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,625
You really are that straight

392
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,291
Sorry

393
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,234
"No, no, no"

394
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:53,601
I respect that. Let me apologize

395
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,602
Bye dad

396
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,308
Bye

397
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,462
Listen Gracy

398
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,661
"You know I'm sorry about leaving you,"

399
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,828
"and Kelly like this,"

400
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,734
but I should have been out of the house
two years ago

401
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,773
"No shit, Shaney"

402
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,255
Yes we want variety

403
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,691
Yes you got to toss the salad...

404
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,560
"...but no, that doesn't mean
letting in whores,"

405
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,188
"and yid's, like last night"

406
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,493
"They were your cousins, Stevie"

407
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,093
I don't care if it was my
Mother and my Father

408
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,069
They look like shit

409
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,196
"Okay, Stevie"

410
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,105
"No, no, no, no okay Stevie,
no it is cool"

411
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,972
"Family my ass, lets go"

412
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,671
"These fuckers are hot,"

413
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,205
what do you think?

414
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,980
Fabulous love. Now get out of here

415
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,474
Get out of here! Lets go!

416
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,045
Hey can I talk to you about maybe
putting somebody on the list

417
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,421
"You have to talk to Steve,"

418
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,023
and he has been working
seventy-two hours straight

419
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,857
So you tread lightly

420
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,658
"The IRS, oh please"

421
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,790
"Even though you pay me like a cashier,"

422
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,300
I'm the accountant in the place...

423
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,063
...and it is me who is going down
with you

424
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,229
You get caught by blabbing your
big mouth all over the place

425
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,138
"Do me a favor, throw away that
nasty weed of yours"

426
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,642
Because paranoia is setting in

427
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,145
Hi

428
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,911
Hi. How is the new kid?

429
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,343
You need a little something
for the night?

430
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:23,518
"Buck tells me, you have been doing
a good job"

431
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:25,991
What sign are you?

432
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,028
"Umm, Cancer"

433
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,263
"Cancer, good people Cancer"

434
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:34,964
What do you think Viv?

435
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,840
Crabs

436
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,773
"Steve umm, I wanted to
talk to you about..."

437
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,983
I got some friends I wanted to
find about putting them on the list

438
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,915
Do they look like you?

439
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,617
One is my cousin

440
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:57,084
"Let me explain something kid, okay..."

441
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,254
Once a month...

442
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,560
"the nephew of the King of Saudi Arabia,"

443
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,089
flies...7000 miles

444
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,432
"to dance here for one night, all night"

445
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,165
Then gets back on his plane at sunrise

446
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,969
He tells me it is the only place
on Earth...

447
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,874
...that he feels totally free

448
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,238
"So naturally, I,"

449
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,772
"...we, have a responsibility"

450
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:23,516
So I repeat. Do they look like you?

451
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,990
They are my friends

452
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,822
Fine. I'll put them on the list

453
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,402
But they better look like you

454
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,907
Thanks

455
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,570
Julie

456
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,608
"You are a mess, come here"

457
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,741
Hey did you sleep with somebody
to get your job?

458
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,447
"My job, please"

459
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:41,625
"Listen Shane, you better watch how much
you party, or you will get fired"

460
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,156
Here

461
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,965
I don't do that crud

462
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,198
"Come on, you need an equalizer"

463
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,371
Come on. You look like Stevie

464
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,313
There you go

465
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,853
"Steve could be a rat-bastard,"

466
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,052
there is no question about it

467
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,293
"He took my friends off the list,"

468
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,126
as soon as I left his office

469
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,558
"Look again man. Shane invited us,
Shane O'Shea"

470
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,693
He works here

471
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,494
"I told them later that,"

472
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,401
Steve was always playing
little games like that...

473
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,831
"...just cruel,"

474
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,499
never figured out why

475
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,710
With the kind of power he had
Why play games?

476
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,945
He was weird that way

477
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,678
Like some nights he would keep
the club almost empty

478
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,583
"There would be a thousand people out
on the streets,"

479
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,315
...and only a hundred inside dancing

480
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,518
"Shane look, it is Billie Austin"

481
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,329
"Billie, what is her deal?"

482
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,029
She knows everybody

483
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,966
Especially everybody in
the music industry

484
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,337
"Help me out, she is into coke"

485
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,138
You want to meet her?

486
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,590
Oh thanks

487
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,594
"Diana, help herself to the
last of my snow"

488
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,864
Recording artist...

489
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,126
You know Anita is a recording artist too

490
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,360
"Oh? Wonderful, what label?"

491
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,700
Well I don't really have one yet

492
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,411
"Oh so send me a tape, I would
love to hear it"

493
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,985
Thank you! Thank you!

494
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,548
"As a matter of fact, I think I have
a tape here with me"

495
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,787
The recording is not that great

496
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,701
Home equipment...

497
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,162
Bye

498
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,305
They are cute

499
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:18,715
I just love discovering new talent

500
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,956
You have the body of David and the
face of a Bottchelli

501
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,460
Bottle of what?

502
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,770
"Just say thanks, darling"

503
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,603
It is really funky but

504
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,010
I don't think it is me

505
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,978
"Darling, I don't think you realize
what is you"

506
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,344
"I just want to look cool when I'm out,"

507
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,749
...like a New Yorker

508
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:54,190
"What you are, is part of
Billie's Big Bang theory"

509
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,016
Billie taught me how the world worked

510
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,962
How I had the power to get
whatever it was I wanted

511
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,465
Oh yes!

512
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,463
Rhett...When did he quit?

513
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,030
Tonight

514
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,707
Oh I was crushed

515
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,404
He was incredible

516
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,284
Whoa! Can't Wait

517
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,117
"Easy, easy"

518
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,420
Yeah! Now try this

519
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,535
"Ooh, you learn fast!"

520
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,470
I bet I could do that job

521
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,442
Should I talk to Stevie for you?

522
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,307
I don't know

523
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,515
My friend has been waiting for that job

524
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,809
But do you want it?

525
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,417
"Yeah, I want it"

526
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,187
What would you do to get it?

527
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,668
Who is it?

528
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,331
That ought to be illegal

529
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,802
May I help you?

530
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:39,753
Rhett quit. Job...you know...

531
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,286
Let me get this straight

532
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,123
You want a job?

533
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,322
Shouldn't I be taking my pants off?

534
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,851
Of course everyone knows
Rhett is history

535
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,382
And Shane will take his place

536
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,853
"Later on I learned that,"

537
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,452
Billie had spoken to Stevie
about my promotion

538
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,424
"I have to admit, I felt bad for Greg"

539
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,693
I name you Shane 54!

540
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,383
"We were both right,"

541
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,615
too short and I do not suck cock

542
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,126
Well there is nothing you can do
about being short

543
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,539
I'm going to make us some real money

544
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,972
I got other ideas

545
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,617
How about the best fuck of your lifetime

546
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,451
So I made it

547
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,760
Bartending was the best job in the world

548
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,060
"But for me the big thing was,"

549
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,965
"when you are a bartender at "54""

550
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,229
Everybody knew your name

551
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,466
You were famous

552
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,903
"Come on, I want to introduce you to him"

553
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:44,807
He doesn't want to be
photographed tonight

554
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,109
Steve didn't draw a line between
customers and employees

555
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,853
"Before "54","

556
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,946
most clubs would hide their help

557
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,787
"Not Steve, he flaunted his"

558
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,959
"People made such a big deal about
getting into "54""

559
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,397
"But they didn't know,"

560
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,957
because once you got into the door...

561
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,026
...you wanted to get into
the D.J.'s booth

562
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,162
Or the office where the best coke was

563
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,034
"Or the balcony where the people were
getting laid,"

564
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,701
or the basement where the
biggest names hung out

565
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,380
Steve was so fucking smart

566
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,444
I mean you would have to be
some kind of genius

567
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,315
"to take a dirty wet basement...
and turn it into a VIP room,"

568
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,377
which celebrities would kill
to get into

569
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,816
There was always another door

570
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,024
"Shane darling, I guess you
finally arrived"

571
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,493
Hi Andy

572
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,264
"Shane, Shane, this is Andy"

573
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,596
"Oh yeah, wow!"

574
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,595
"Andy loves it down here,"

575
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,261
"...don't you, Andy?"

576
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,498
"Oh yeah, it is really brown"

577
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,994
Even outside the club

578
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,333
I was always working it

579
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,334
"Getting an article placed in "Interview""

580
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,700
Mingling with the right people

581
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:54,801
I got it

582
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,312
Raising my profile

583
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,850
It was all coming together

584
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,744
"Billie got me and Anita an invitation,"

585
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,144
...to Liz Vangelder's

586
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,375
because she knew there would be
some great contacts for us

587
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,581
Her dinner parties were really
a big deal

588
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,143
Hi I'm Shane. This is Anita

589
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,552
We are Billie's friends

590
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,881
"Yes, of course. I'm Liz Vangelder"

591
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,861
"Well, the night life here is
amusing enough I suppose"

592
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:51,226
"Believe me, nothing compares to London
in the swinging sixties"

593
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,063
"Come on, where did you find them?"

594
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,769
L'universite de cinquante-quatre

595
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:03,312
""54?" The bartender at 54?"

596
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,974
You sly puss

597
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,584
Bringing a bartender to the table

598
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,479
Steve is holding auditions
for a New Years act

599
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,054
He says he wants something fresh

600
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,761
Nobody is as fresh as me

601
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,499
"I might even have a tape with, you know,
in my purse"

602
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,829
"Really, I have a tape deck in my..."

603
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,200
"So here I was,"

604
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,966
putting my Jersey moves on Park Avenue

605
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,366
I really believed I had come out of
there with some good connections

606
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:37,645
You have the essence of Errol Flynn

607
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,842
"Instead, I saw how far I have to go"

608
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,852
Who?

609
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,751
"Darling, you know who Errol Flynn is"

610
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,756
"Oh yeah, Arrow Flynn. Right"

611
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:57,893
You know you are the most gorgeous
troglodyte I have ever seen

612
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,092
Thanks

613
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,742
"Shane, I don't know who the fuck
Arrow Flint is either"

614
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,579
But don't you know what a troglodyte is?

615
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,517
"Yeah, it's like a diamond"

616
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:21,055
A troglodyte is like a caveman

617
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,219
He called you a caveman

618
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,956
And that makes me a cave woman

619
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,097
"Anita, are you ready?"

620
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:35,962
"Yeah, in a minute"

621
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:38,700
What are you doing?

622
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,706
He is giving me a break

623
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,044
"And Shane, lay off"

624
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,828
Where is the article?

625
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,607
""Shane 54, I can do anybody""

626
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,618
"See if you had let me be involved
in the photo-shoot,"

627
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,321
this wouldn't have happened

628
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,130
You should have known with a
magazine like this!

629
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,257
"Anita, lay off. Please"

630
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,404
"Come on, I know how to cheer you up"

631
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,540
So we are going to start with the hips

632
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,742
"One, two, three, four..."

633
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,214
For extra dough Anita taught
suburbanites how to disco dance

634
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,346
"Well, she tried anyway"

635
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,424
"Second thing, we are going to do
is attitude"

636
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,829
If you want to make it to Studio 54...

637
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,835
...the most important thing is
you've to have the right attitude

638
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,870
And the attitude is in face

639
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,666
"So we are going to go, watch me now,"

640
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,570
because this is a very
special step for attitude

641
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,634
"One, two, three, four. One, two, three,"

642
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,473
...attitude

643
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,879
"One, two, three, attitude"

644
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,550
Give me some attitude!

645
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:33,881
"Give me some attitude, show me! Show me!
Show me your stuff!"

646
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,433
"Think Travolta, come on!"

647
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,604
"Keep going, keep going"

648
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,439
I'm going to go for some inspiration

649
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,706
"Oh please, Shane just give me
some inspiration"

650
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,095
Hey!

651
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:16,797
Hey!

652
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,892
Keep your hands off my wife

653
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,459
"Don't smother me, Grego"

654
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,038
"Oh thank you, I was so hungry"

655
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,904
Are you going to stay for the busto'?

656
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:31,641
Sounds great but I got some
business of my own

657
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,008
"Shane, why don't you show us
how you do your splits"

658
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,843
"I'm not going to do that Mario,
you do that"

659
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:37,882
Alright

660
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,284
Shane!

661
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,052
"I leave you alone for one second,"

662
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,116
and look what happens!

663
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,058
"Are you alright, does it hurt?"

664
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,452
Just a little

665
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:47,258
Don't move. I'm going to go get some ice

666
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,196
I'm sorry

667
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:23,422
"'Ludes, Angel Dust...And this,
this is MDA"

668
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,634
"This is why the "Studio" is
such a great party"

669
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,025
This month anyhow

670
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:44,712
Thanks

671
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:50,920
"You can do it too, man"

672
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,623
Hey midget! I hear you got some
choice MDA

673
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,027
"Twenty each, for you...twenty-five"

674
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,230
"Oh eat me raw, Tom Thumb"

675
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,570
I never pay for my drugs

676
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,239
And I don't take medicare

677
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,338
"So tell me, how much money does
the club pull in?"

678
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:19,179
"I'd say, we...I make..."

679
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:22,316
"$750,000.00...Every night"

680
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,026
And that would be before Uncle Sam
gets his teeth into it?

681
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,262
"Let me put it this way,"

682
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,927
what the I.R.S. doesn't know
won't hurt them

683
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:34,867
"Let me put it this way,"

684
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,634
what the I.R.S. doesn't know
won't hurt them

685
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,944
"The secret is that I'm, I'm kind of
a philosopher..."

686
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,003
Can you believe the nerve of this man?

687
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,674
"He did Merv last week, Dick Cavet,"

688
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:46,978
...and now this!

689
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,817
I understand the path of excess
leads to the palace of wisdom

690
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,014
Do you ever read Blake?

691
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,215
I have

692
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,656
"Yeah, I love Blake. That is
my favorite poet"

693
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,626
You got to get to somebody in that place

694
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:02,020
"That is right, I love that
May I kiss your hand?"

695
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,528
"You know, I've been good
for the whole week now"

696
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,827
Yeah? Yeah

697
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,772
"Well, keep being good and quit
looking at me like that"

698
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,778
I'm not looking at you

699
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,142
Who would want to look at you!

700
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:34,924
"Hey, give me that"

701
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,259
Stop it

702
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,824
"C'mon, I want to help
Guys do everything"

703
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,496
"No...it's not because you don't, but..."

704
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:42,904
Are you trying to turn me on?

705
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,429
No. I'm trying to cook

706
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,566
Say that again

707
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:46,734
What?

708
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,775
"You're insulting me, babe,
because you know..."

709
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,174
"C'mon, let me go"

710
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,750
Oh right! I was just after the spoon

711
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,022
Spoon?!

712
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:21,467
You bastard. You jealous bastard

713
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:24,275
You won't just get away... Lay off

714
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,441
I didn't even do anything

715
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:27,711
Right! Right!

716
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,275
I told you nothing's going on

717
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,616
Bullshit

718
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:36,358
"Greg, baby, you're talking about Shane"

719
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,388
"If you like, doing..."

720
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,360
How can I?

721
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,795
I caught you

722
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,061
"You are a jealous maniac and you better
get over it,"

723
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,794
because I'm not sticking around for more

724
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,060
You're threatening me?

725
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:51,767
I told you before we got married
that I'm not your slave

726
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:52,934
""No smothering, Grego", right?"

727
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:53,839
Right!

728
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,310
Right? Right

729
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:58,337
"And you agreed, remember?"

730
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:16,828
You are the only one I love
You're my baby

731
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,467
My baby!

732
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,378
Hi

733
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,914
Hi. Do I...

734
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,358
Shane

735
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,661
"Nice to meet you, Shane"

736
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:20,989
"Lets go, Julie"

737
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,397
"No ticket, no coat"

738
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,601
Just look for it

739
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,669
"Do you know how many black
leather jackets,"

740
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,906
with poppers and a cock-ring in the
left pocket we got back here?

741
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,232
You are killing me!

742
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,625
Hey

743
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,569
What's wrong?

744
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,545
I started to take a leak and it felt
like razor blades

745
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,841
Oh oh

746
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,076
What?

747
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,975
Don't tell me it is your first

748
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,877
My first what?

749
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,490
"You got "the clap" man"

750
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,016
Shit

751
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:24,754
Wake up

752
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,165
"Penicillin, huh?"

753
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,375
We must be neighbors. I live just...

754
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:45,673
"Don't worry, your secret is safe with me"

755
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,375
Thanks

756
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,850
Shit

757
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,321
"Thanks, Dottie"

758
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,656
"It is Mona,"

759
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,294
"but that is just between you and
me too, okay?"

760
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,167
Okay

761
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,005
"Grandma, look it"

762
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,169
"Oh, that is beautiful"

763
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,574
Now can you say hi to Shane

764
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:19,206
Hi

765
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,341
Hi

766
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:27,588
"Sweetmeat, sweetmeat, give Disco Dottie
her funky little treat"

767
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,225
"Hey Atlanta, we need more champagne
on the banquettes"

768
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,824
Anthony is having a cow

769
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,631
He said we were short a thousand
the other night

770
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:36,524
Yeah?

771
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:36,895
Yeah

772
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,128
"I have a friend at Xenon who will
put you to work,"

773
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:40,760
and not bitch about it

774
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,806
Why don't you go dance
It is slowing down out there

775
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,308
What?

776
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,743
"I'm letting you go, you are fired"

777
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,543
"You can't fire me,"

778
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,449
why would you want to?

779
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:57,578
"Your sticky little fingers,"

780
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,917
didn't you think Anthony would notice?

781
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:00,553
Notice what?

782
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:05,492
"Oh, you're embarrassing yourself
Here is your severance"

783
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,966
"Stevie, I have worked for you,
for ten years"

784
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,232
I helped you get your first steak house

785
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,264
You have been here too long

786
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:23,343
Your paranoia is getting to me

787
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,747
"If there is money missing,
look someplace else"

788
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,711
"Anthony is having a cow, okay!"

789
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,777
And somebody's head has to roll!

790
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:45,717
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Christmas present
from me to you"

791
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:55,536
Every night I think about staying home

792
00:57:55,572 --> 00:58:00,771
But then I come to my senses and
give myself a good kick in the ass

793
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,829
"Man, look at this pit!"

794
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,664
Nicotine break

795
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:28,761
Right on

796
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:34,871
I thought this night would never end

797
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,174
"Thank God, it is Christmas"

798
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,345
Can't wait to get out of here

799
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,850
Are you going home tommorow?

800
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,148
No

801
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,252
I haven't talked to my Dad in
four months

802
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,024
"Why don't you come with me and Anita
to her Mother's,"

803
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,456
...It will be fun

804
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:56,630
Thanks

805
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,367
Yeah

806
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,537
Lets clean this place up
Lets get out of this hole

807
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,369
"Hey you hear, Romeo is quitting
New Year's Eve"

808
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:05,704
"If you think I'm ever
going to get that job,"

809
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:06,800
...you are dreaming

810
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,841
He is never going to promote me

811
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:12,336
"Listen, I'll talk to him"

812
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:14,884
Alright

813
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,385
"Anyway when we have our own place,"

814
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,080
"we will get to do all the hiring, right?"

815
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,315
Yeah right

816
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,855
"Alright, I'll meet you downstairs when
you are finished with this stuff"

817
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,327
Say what?

818
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,993
Steve doesn't want me to do anymore
of the bussing or anything

819
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:32,794
Are you for real?

820
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,696
What?

821
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:39,905
You're getting so conceited. It's like
don't know who I'm talking to anymore

822
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,071
"What is your problem, man?"

823
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:43,607
"You pour drinks,"

824
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,273
you hang out with some high-class
stuck up assholes...

825
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,441
"...and suddenly you are some big star,"

826
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,676
you can't get your hands dirty

827
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,018
"Look at you, dealing more drugs than
"Johnson & Johnson""

828
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:53,346
Hey that money is for Anita's studio

829
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,481
You know that

830
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:55,821
"Oh, I see"

831
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,689
"You know what, Shane, your head is
filled up with so much shit,"

832
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,024
you don't even know what you are
talking about

833
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,360
"Hey, Greg, cool it man. I'm your friend"

834
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:05,122
"Yeah, friend, who is trying to
scope my wife"

835
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,465
What the hell are you talking about?

836
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,697
She is the only girl this side of
Fifth Avenue you haven't balled

837
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,863
You don't know what you're talking about

838
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,375
"Fuck you, Shane 54"

839
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,600
Come on

840
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,301
Lay off!

841
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:46,709
Lets get out of here

842
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,004
Sit on it!

843
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,312
Fuck off!

844
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,677
I'm not your slave!

845
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,439
"You know, I told him before
we got married"

846
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,678
I told him what the deal was

847
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,180
"I said, I love you but need to be free,"

848
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:33,654
I need to have fun

849
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,022
"You know maybe not forever, but for now!"

850
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:40,425
"And he said, okay, okay. You know,
whatever you need"

851
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,090
I want you to be free

852
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,462
My ass!

853
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:51,900
"I could fucking kill him, when he
gets like that!"

854
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,145
What's wrong?

855
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,484
"Shane, Shane stop!"

856
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,355
"Shane, he is there"

857
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:44,552
Let him watch

858
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,328
This is bad for him

859
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,986
"The Dow Jones Industrial continued
its slide today,"

860
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:18,391
bringing the two day drop to forty
points. The news from Washington today

861
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,939
"Where you been, turkey!"

862
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,464
"Great to see you, Gracie!"

863
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:34,743
Are those for us?

864
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,237
Whoa! Tinsel teeth

865
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,441
"Thanks to you, I shouldn't have
taken your money"

866
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,480
"Lets go in, I'm freezing"

867
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:44,416
"Whoa, nice car. Is it yours?"

868
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,415
"I'm famous, you know"

869
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,480
"Yeah I know, we saw you,"

870
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:49,957
"in the paper, dancing with some old lady"

871
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,858
And I read that Princess Grace
showed up there too

872
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,021
Did you tell her about us?

873
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,498
I was off that night

874
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,030
"Come on, I'm starved"

875
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,160
"Why don't we go for a ride,"

876
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,204
I mean no one is home anyway

877
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:03,969
What?

878
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,270
They went to Aunt Mary's

879
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,480
Ricko's aunt got into the studio
one night

880
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,644
And she told us...

881
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,812
she saw you putting something
up your nose

882
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,485
She is such a liar

883
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,815
"Hey, maybe you can come in
I'll try to talk him into it"

884
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,986
No thanks!

885
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,872
"Don't make them right about you, Shane"

886
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,712
"There is nothing wrong with this stuff,
Gracie"

887
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,717
"He drinks,"

888
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:49,979
it is the same thing

889
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,881
Good. I want to try one of these

890
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,883
"In the morning, I went to breakfast
at the Alpine Inn,"

891
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,359
"like we used to, the day after Christmas
when mom was alive"

892
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,327
"Could I get a cappuccino, please?"

893
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:38,060
Excuse me?

894
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,729
Wrong side of the river!

895
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:46,973
Hey...

896
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,672
Hi

897
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,511
"I'm Shane, we met at the..."

898
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:53,845
"Yeah, I know who you are"

899
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:59,054
Would you mind? Could I...

900
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,822
Sure

901
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,333
What are you doing out here?

902
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,398
Spending the week with my parents

903
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:25,274
You look like you crawled out
from under a rock

904
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:29,781
Well it hasn't been the
greatest homecoming

905
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,047
I see

906
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,519
"Hey waitress, two cups of coffee, please"

907
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,386
When in Rome...

908
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:44,999
"It is a whole other world, huh!"

909
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:47,400
"You will learn. Two languages,"

910
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,961
"two sets of clothes, two sets of friends"

911
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:51,704
You kept your friends out here

912
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:55,006
"Well no, actually the clothes were
a lot easier"

913
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,380
"It is insane, isn't it?"

914
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,350
"I mean, Manhattan is a whole
other problem,"

915
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,876
"it is up one minute, down the next"

916
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,888
"Story of my life, one thousand percent"

917
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,083
Two thousand percent

918
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,900
"You know, I have had so much coffee,
I'm realy to take flight"

919
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,469
Bird of Paradise

920
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:38,981
Hold on...

921
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,149
So you remember today

922
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:50,525
Thank you

923
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:07,412
Whoa

924
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,944
Who would have thought!

925
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:10,281
What?

926
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,585
That you were so sweet

927
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,855
"You got to tell us what we want to
hear about him,"

928
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:19,190
or we are going to nail you

929
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,828
We are talking a audit that goes
all the way back

930
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:24,929
"And my friend, we find something
we don't like,"

931
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:26,628
"and believe me, we will"

932
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:31,201
"Guess what, your house, is gone
Your car, is gone"

933
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:34,106
You...are seriously gone

934
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,974
I'm talking 10 to 20 years

935
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,405
"You want to investigate, go ahead"

936
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:43,649
"My car, not in my name. My house,
not in my name"

937
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:46,416
"My back account, don't have one"

938
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,821
"You know what I got, Agates"

939
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,157
What about the drugs?

940
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,155
Were they in your name?

941
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:55,623
The were in the glove compartment

942
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,495
Yes!

943
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:05,096
"Wow, you are good"

944
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:07,165
"Four brothers, and I never lost a game"

945
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,941
Oh really. I have been meaning to
tell you something

946
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,910
It is sort of embarrassing

947
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:17,674
"You can tell me,"

948
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,210
...what are you talking about?

949
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:25,586
After I saw that picture of you
in that gossip column

950
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,558
"It was, you know, inspiring"

951
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,859
What?

952
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:32,393
"I mean it, just to see someone else,"

953
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:33,628
...from Jersey who made it

954
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,503
Made it? You are kidding right

955
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:37,539
I'm on Soap

956
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:38,767
Right

957
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,638
Wrong. Soap work is the pits

958
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,234
"Why do you think I'm at "54"
every night?"

959
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:45,070
I don't know

960
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,741
Maybe to meet somebody interesting?

961
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,482
Exactly

962
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,711
"In this business it is all about
who you know. And since,"

963
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,086
"I'm going to get a movie or die trying,"

964
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,250
"...there is no place better than "54""

965
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,190
"One big bender, with business cards"

966
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:09,734
"See the thing is, if you meet the right
producer like Ron Sax for instance,"

967
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,295
You got it made

968
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:12,567
"I mean, he has his hands in everything"

969
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,474
"Music, movies, clubs"

970
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:18,412
Right. But you don't need that

971
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:21,007
"Shane, come on,"

972
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,278
"you are a "54" bartender"

973
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,785
You know how things work

974
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,313
You know what this is all about

975
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,083
You have had to maneuver

976
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,350
"Sometimes you use your charms,"

977
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,982
...sometimes other things

978
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,119
Okay you got me

979
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,468
This place is really great

980
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,407
You can actually see people here

981
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,013
You are so cute

982
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,486
Starting the decade with
the perfect kiss

983
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,892
What could be better than that?

984
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,857
Picking up that 7-10 split

985
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,023
"Oh yeah, I'm going to do it first"

986
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,995
"No, you are not! It is mine"

987
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:15,270
"Forget it, come on, give me that ball"

988
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,407
Opps

989
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,414
"Yeah of course, you are on the list"

990
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,445
Okay

991
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,553
What is this?

992
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:43,524
It is the missing money. I took it

993
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:46,700
What money?

994
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,670
You know...Anthony's money

995
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:51,839
Oh that is adorable!

996
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:53,572
"Now Greg is very lucky,"

997
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,337
to have a friend like you to
cover for him

998
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,144
You knew?

999
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:02,910
Yeah. You know I see everything
that goes on here

1000
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,543
"You don't think that I'm watching,"

1001
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:05,780
...but I am

1002
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:07,382
He would have never touched that money

1003
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,721
if he had been made a bartender
in the first place

1004
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:12,150
He is really a great guy Steve

1005
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:13,991
He thought he would be a busboy for
the rest of his life

1006
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,259
Yeah I'm sure

1007
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:17,890
Can't you give him a break?

1008
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:27,735
"So you want me, to make him
a bartender now?"

1009
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,872
"You know, I am too nice for my own good"

1010
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,713
People take advantage

1011
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:37,880
"Thanks, Steve"

1012
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,654
But don't you say anything to him. Okay?

1013
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,923
I'll tell him myself

1014
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,122
Why is everyone so sentimental
this time of year!

1015
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,728
I hate the holidays

1016
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:09,645
"Greg, hey man. It is great to see you"

1017
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:11,647
I wasn't sure if you were coming back

1018
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:13,318
"No way,"

1019
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:14,788
I couldn't miss Anita tonight. Plus...

1020
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:17,155
I should meet up with my
very possibly girlfriend?

1021
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:19,851
Girlfriend? Is that where you have been?

1022
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,697
"Yeah...Julie Black, man"

1023
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:23,959
Bull shit!

1024
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:24,693
"I'm not jiving you, I swear"

1025
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,631
"Great, man"

1026
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,428
I got to go find Anthony

1027
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,666
You need any party materials?

1028
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,002
"No thanks, not tonight"

1029
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:41,110
Steve!

1030
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:43,778
"Come on, I have been here every holiday"

1031
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,309
It is New Year's eve

1032
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,116
"Please, I'm so Ionely"

1033
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:48,088
"Go home, honey"

1034
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,616
This is my home

1035
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,438
Remember what happens tomorrow?

1036
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:09,705
"The new decade, Turkey"

1037
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:11,879
The new bartender gets announced

1038
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:15,740
"Oh right. It is looking good for you
for sure, man"

1039
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,478
Really?

1040
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:17,485
Hey! Hey!

1041
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,687
Your fairy tale wish just came true

1042
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,215
I got a very special job for you tonight

1043
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,191
"Grace Kelly is coming,"

1044
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,256
and I want you to take care of her

1045
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,763
No shit!

1046
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:29,991
Yes

1047
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:30,930
"but try not to say "shit" around her,
okay..."

1048
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,263
"She is from Philly,"

1049
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,496
but I don't think she does that anymore

1050
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,371
"No, not tonight. Not tonight"

1051
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,737
"Never, never, never come to me like that"

1052
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,543
Kelly? Are you sleeping?

1053
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,472
Is Gracie there?

1054
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,049
"Well tell her, I'm going to meet
Princess Grace tonight"

1055
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,922
Ahh! No kidding! No way!

1056
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,331
I just wanted to wish you
good luck tonight

1057
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:08,869
You are going to be great

1058
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:16,074
Happy New Year!

1059
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,872
"Hey, it is Errol Flynn"

1060
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:24,875
"It is great to see you man,
I have been trying to reach you..."

1061
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,046
Hold on

1062
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,248
My date is getting crushed

1063
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,555
Hi

1064
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:32,921
Hi

1065
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:35,928
I got a great idea

1066
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:45,807
"Oh come on, it will be wild"

1067
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:48,439
Some of us are going back to
Roland's house later

1068
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:49,910
"He wants to know, you want to come?"

1069
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,981
Actually it will be just us three

1070
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,082
"There goes Donna, excuse me"

1071
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:06,492
"I don't understand,"

1072
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:10,328
"I thought we, you know, connected"

1073
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:11,923
"Shane, I already explained this to you,"

1074
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:15,164
my career is really important to me
right now

1075
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,700
"Listen Shane, I like you, I really do..."

1076
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,206
"...but drop the fantasy, okay"

1077
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,469
"I'm building something here,
and I thought,"

1078
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,066
...you wanted to get ahead too

1079
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,604
Now Roland's the kind of guy that can
make that happen for you

1080
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,011
Don't you want that?

1081
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,477
Not that way

1082
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:45,062
Happy New Year!

1083
01:16:54,543 --> 01:17:00,482
"Okay, first I wanted to tell you all
something"

1084
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,881
That most of you already know

1085
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,647
I love you

1086
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,186
"We love you too, Steve!"

1087
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:22,828
Secondly. There have been a few little
rumors floating around...

1088
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,532
...about me and a certain
government agency

1089
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:28,872
"But rest assured, that is all
taken care of"

1090
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,674
Just try and tangle with me!

1091
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:40,047
"And now, I want to introduce you
to a brand new talent"

1092
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,350
A talent for the 80's

1093
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,618
"That I discovered in the coat room,"

1094
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,852
...believe it or not!

1095
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:48,596
Please welcome...Anita!

1096
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:11,385
Tonight is the night I fly. Spread my
wings and touch the sky!

1097
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:29,363
Tonight is the night I see...everything
that's waiting for me

1098
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:45,147
I'm loving this new world I'm in
You know it fits like second skin

1099
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:54,218
Then they say it comes and goes so fast
But we got something built to last

1100
01:18:54,262 --> 01:19:00,724
"Oh baby, it's your love
that sets me free!"

1101
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:07,571
Tonight is the night I fly
Spread my wings and touch the sky!

1102
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:15,414
Tonight is the night I see everything
that's waiting for me

1103
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:29,558
"Ohh, yeah, oohh right, tonight I fly!
Tonight is the night!"

1104
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:41,772
I've got to be free!
Everybody gets down!

1105
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,185
Turn on the lights!

1106
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:36,955
Dottie? Dottie?

1107
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,504
Mona?

1108
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,596
"Hey, hey. Princess Grace is here
and she is thirsty"

1109
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:52,640
What?

1110
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:53,663
"This way, you are on. Come on"

1111
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:54,766
No

1112
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:59,337
Shaney...It has been a mean night. Okay?

1113
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,747
And I'll cry about it tomorrow. I will

1114
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,744
"But tonight, the show must go on"

1115
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:05,116
Lets go

1116
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,178
I can't. I can't talk to anybody

1117
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:10,017
"We did it to her, this place did"

1118
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,887
"Come on, come on. You can't
blame yourself,"

1119
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,829
...if she couldn't handle her drugs

1120
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:17,126
"Come on, lets go"

1121
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,499
"It will calm you down. Come on, take it"

1122
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,402
This isn't right

1123
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:26,133
Princess Grace is here. Okay?

1124
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:28,038
Princess Grace

1125
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,134
We lost a friend tonight

1126
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,303
"No, no, no. I lost a friend tonight"

1127
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:32,608
"Alright, no offense,"

1128
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:33,841
but you were just another
pretty face to her

1129
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:34,906
She was my friend

1130
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,178
"Oh, she was completely nearsighted"

1131
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:37,741
She couldn't tell one of you
from the next

1132
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,117
Now get it together and get downstairs

1133
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:45,758
Hey! Don't forget how replaceable
you are. Little Lord Fauntleroy

1134
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,228
"Try telling them that, Stevie! Remember?"

1135
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,890
I'm one of New York's finest

1136
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:51,228
I'm Shane 54!

1137
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:56,666
Like there wasn't a Gabriel 54
and a Rhett 54

1138
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:58,103
Bullshit!

1139
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:04,810
"Don't tell me that is the first time
you ever read an "Interview" Magazine"

1140
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:06,272
"Oh no, it is!"

1141
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:13,151
"Fuck you, you troglodyte"

1142
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,819
"Hey, where you going!
The door is that way!"

1143
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:18,048
He is out!

1144
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,679
I love you

1145
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:57,558
I.R.S.

1146
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:05,200
They are here

1147
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:12,040
"Shane, I knew you would come to your
senses. Meine klein Shane"

1148
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,637
"I went downstairs to get my keys,"

1149
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:15,171
...and they are raiding the office

1150
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:25,150
"Even from here, those suits look cheap"

1151
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,731
"Steve, are you going to get out of here?"

1152
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:37,832
Where would I go?

1153
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:49,615
"Lets go, Shane"

1154
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:50,618
What are you guys doing!

1155
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:51,778
Steve wants you out!

1156
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:57,582
"Get off me! Yo' Billy, come on, man!"

1157
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,852
Get out of here!

1158
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,120
I got to get my wallet

1159
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,476
"Hey, these handcuffs are too tight!"

1160
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,507
They will leave marks

1161
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:21,339
What am I?

1162
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,441
Public Enemy Number One
for Christ's sake

1163
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:32,258
This is so tacky

1164
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,107
Shane!

1165
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,009
You want a ride?

1166
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:04,382
"Look Shane, I'm sorry. I know I
acted like a fool,"

1167
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:06,586
but you know how it is in there

1168
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:09,960
Where is Roland?

1169
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:12,259
I lost him in the balcony

1170
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:16,928
I'm sorry. Come on

1171
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,296
What about your career?

1172
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:19,499
I thought that was your big priority

1173
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:24,175
Yeah well...I'm not so sure anymore

1174
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:30,441
Me neither

1175
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:35,081
So now what?

1176
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:38,116
"I like you, Shane"

1177
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:40,387
"Lets face it,"

1178
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:41,486
...we are Jersey

1179
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:44,026
"Yeah, we are"

1180
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:51,238
So...friends?

1181
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,972
Friends

1182
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:07,912
"Agents of the I.R.S. and the F.B.I.,"

1183
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:10,390
"...raided the highly popular Studio 54,"

1184
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,188
So that is how my decade ended

1185
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:14,688
"In the year and a half that
Steve was in jail,"

1186
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,060
...things changed a lot

1187
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:18,622
Big corporations had taken over
the New York Club World

1188
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,258
...doing what corporations do

1189
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:22,727
Making everything safe and boring

1190
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,099
The freedom was gone

1191
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,801
I kept in touch with Julie

1192
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:29,110
"She was doing alright,"

1193
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:30,270
"she moved to Hollywood,"

1194
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:31,801
and got a small part in a good film

1195
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:35,138
I hadn't seen Greg and Anita in a while

1196
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:36,850
Brought back too many memories

1197
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:39,119
"They were still together, doing fine"

1198
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:42,122
Anita recorded a great album
with Casablanca

1199
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:44,590
but some people thought it was too disco

1200
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,186
I had been taking business classes
at NY during the day

1201
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:51,426
and managing a restaurant
in the Village at night

1202
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:54,958
"As far as my dad went,
it was better there too"

1203
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:58,169
I got to Jersey to see him and
my sisters about once a week

1204
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:02,070
"When I heard about Steve's
welcome back party,"

1205
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:03,537
...I couldn't resist

1206
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:18,750
"After getting off with just
six months probation,"

1207
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:20,420
...Greg gave up dealing

1208
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:22,491
He got a good job in construction

1209
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:10,377
It is so good to see you again

1210
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,104
It is great to be back

1211
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,248
"I was in the Bahamas, you know"

1212
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:27,392
On a year and a half forced vacation

1213
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:32,499
"Don't you love my Club "Fed" tan?"

1214
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,870
"I want you to know,"

1215
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:48,706
only my friends are here tonight

1216
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:53,415
But I did put my parole officer
on the list

1217
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:07,631
"You know, prison can be so
fucking dull at night"

1218
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:22,743
"I guess, I just wanted to welcome
you all back to say..."

1219
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:27,153
...this time I hope it does last forever

1220
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:35,351
Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back

1221
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:52,976
If you could read my mind love...
what a tale my thoughts would tell

1222
01:30:53,014 --> 01:31:00,511
"Just like an old time movie,
about a ghost from a wishing well"

1223
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:08,462
"In a castle dark, or a fortress strong
with chains upon my feet"

1224
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:16,493
You know that ghost is me. I don't know
where we went wrong

1225
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:21,508
But that feeling's gone and
I just can't get it back

1226
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:36,512
"If you could read my mind, yeah! Oh love
what a tale my thoughts would tell!"

1227
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:43,986
"Just like in a novel, when you reach
the part where the heartache comes,"

1228
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:56,569
the hero will be you!
But heros often fail

1229
01:31:56,611 --> 01:32:04,211
Never thought I'd feel this way. And I
got to say that I just don't get it...

1230
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,686
"See, Steve Rubell had a dream,"

1231
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:09,155
"but like all dreams, you wake up
to reality"

1232
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:11,724
"Even though Steve was just
a consultant now,"

1233
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:13,522
the new owners gave him this night

1234
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:14,755
This one night!

1235
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,454
...To bring all his friends back

1236
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:18,590
To do it his way

1237
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,795
"For one night, we pretended
nothing had changed"

1238
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,099
But in reality...

1239
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:25,638
The party was over
