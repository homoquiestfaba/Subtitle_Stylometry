1
00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:03,158
(bright music)

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:05,991
(birds chirping)

3
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:15,615
(pecans clattering)

4
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:11,813
(birds chirping)

5
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:16,780
- Enable us today, O' Lord,

6
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,123
to reflect on the life of
our beloved Emma Barnsdow.

7
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,310
May her tradition of
love and charity live on

8
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,220
in the hearts of her
two beautiful daughters,

9
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,410
Sarah, who has joined
us from Atlanta today,

10
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,660
and our own dear Wanda.

11
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,960
Bless and keep them both.

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,793
Amen.

13
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:36,626
- [People] Amen.

14
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:40,750
- Thank you, Reverend.

15
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,231
- Reverend.

16
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,503
(people conversing softly)

17
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,590
- Darling, if there's anything I can do.

18
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,507
- Thank you, Reverend.
(Ruby cooing)

19
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,341
(people conversing in distance)

20
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,650
(Sarah sighs)

21
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,400
Thank you for coming.

22
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,877
- It was very nice, Wanda.

23
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,863
- What?

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,643
- The ceremony.

25
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,893
Mother would've been very proud.

26
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,948
- Hi, Gina.
- Hi, Aunt Wanda.

27
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:11,157
- Edmond.

28
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:12,373
- You're not staying?

29
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,300
Everybody's coming over to the house.

30
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,003
- Well, I'd love to,

31
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,680
but I need to get back to Atlanta.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,020
- Jerry's very busy.

33
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,640
Gina and I are gonna
take him to the airport,

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,670
and then we'll be back.

35
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,040
I hope we don't miss too much.

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,970
- No, anytime is fine.

37
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
- [Sarah] Bye, dear.

38
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:37,095
(somber music)

39
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:40,012
(insects chirping)

40
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:43,939
(mellow music)

41
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,773
- Hey, there, baby, did you know

42
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:47,897
that when I was a little girl,

43
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:51,040
your grandma had a magic
yellow rain bucket,

44
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,050
and she used to use it whenever

45
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,250
she wanted to make it stop raining.

46
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,650
All she had to do was just set it outside,

47
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,960
and before you knew it,

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,783
we could go back out and play again.

49
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:00,616
Yes.

50
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,010
Just like this one.

51
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,324
- Almost as pretty as her mama.

52
00:03:05,324 --> 00:03:06,157
You okay, honey?

53
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,290
- Yes.
- You need anything?

54
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,920
- No, but thanks.
(Rudy cooing)

55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,550
- I'll put Ruby to bed.

56
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,714
Come on.

57
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,047
- Come on, baby.

58
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:26,433
(crickets chirping)

59
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,080
- Gina, take off the headset.

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,620
It won't hurt you to be sociable.

61
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,486
Gina!

62
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:44,760
(heavy metal music plays in headphone)

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,593
Thank you.

64
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,598
(soft knocking on door)

65
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:54,431
Wanda!

66
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:57,682
You up?

67
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,805
Hi, sorry we're late.

68
00:04:02,797 --> 00:04:04,830
Jerry's flight was delayed.

69
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,970
Gina.

70
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,790
- Gina, sweetheart, I
didn't see you out there.

71
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,640
How you doing, sweetheart?

72
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,473
Come on in.

73
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:12,681
Why don't you go on inside.

74
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,510
- Wanda, I wanted you to
know how much I appreciate

75
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,133
everything you did for mama,

76
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,719
and I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,280
- I'm surprised you came at all.

78
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,223
- That was quite a turn out you had.

79
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:32,940
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:37,240
Business has been so hectic
these past few years.

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,033
I hope you know it wasn't personal.

82
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:41,813
I hardly see Jerry anymore.

83
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,174
How you holding up, Wanda?

84
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,100
(Wanda sighs in frustration)

85
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,403
- Save it Sarah.

86
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,940
- I was thinking of asking
you to visit up in Atlanta,

87
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,260
but I guess that's out of the question.

88
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,360
- You can stay in the back room.

89
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,670
Eddie had it fixed for mama

90
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,960
when we moved her from the nursing home.

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,920
- Oh, that's real nice,

92
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,310
but I think we'll get a hotel room.

93
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,060
- Well, there's no point in
that because Mr. Hampton's

94
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,960
coming at eight o'clock tomorrow
morning to read the will.

95
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,833
- Hi, Eddie I hope we didn't wake you.

96
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,960
- No. (coughs)

97
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,490
No, we're glad you're here.

98
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,351
Can I help you with your bags?

99
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,023
- They're in the car.

100
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:20,856
- We're gonna be having breakfast

101
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,903
before Mr. Hampton gets
here in the morning.

102
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,573
Gina can sleep on the pull out sofa.

103
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:35,170
You'll wanna keep the fan on,

104
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,690
so the room doesn't get too hot.

105
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,740
When you use the bathroom,

106
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,490
just jiggle the handle on
the back of the toilet, okay?

107
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:46,960
(birds chirping)

108
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,660
- I'd also like Wanda to
have my China tableware,

109
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,660
my 19-inch Magnavox television
set, shoes, clothing,

110
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,980
and all remaining
belongings not so designated

111
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,514
in above mentioned exhibits
one and two respectively.

112
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:03,810
(attorney coughs)

113
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,643
Moving on.

114
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,573
Finally, to my daughter Sarah,

115
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,563
I bequeath my leather reclining chair.

116
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:18,500
- What that's it?

117
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,186
I get the strata lounger lounger,

118
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:23,780
and she gets everything else?

119
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,430
- Maybe mama didn't think
you needed anything, Sarah.

120
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,573
- What that's it?

121
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,860
- I'm afraid so.

122
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,200
- Well, what about the property?

123
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,660
- That's right the pecan grove.

124
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,023
Mama didn't say anything?

125
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,950
- I wasn't aware of any pecan groves.

126
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,310
You see it's unfortunate,

127
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,040
but my partner Mr. Lattimore,

128
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,230
who prepared this for your mother,

129
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,727
he died several years ago.

130
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:57,180
- It's about a hundred
acres up off Highway Seven.

131
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,824
Surely, that's worth something.

132
00:06:58,824 --> 00:07:01,230
- Well, Benjamin he was real thorough.

133
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,000
I just can't imagine
how it slipped through.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,833
- Have you been out there?

135
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,870
I mean do you know what
kind of condition it's in?

136
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,220
- The only time I saw it
was when I was driving by.

137
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,980
Mama used to go out there
once in a while though

138
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,600
until she got six.

139
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,210
- (sighs) So what happens now?

140
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,880
I mean how long can this take in probate?

141
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,713
- Oh, well,

142
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,443
I know Judge McNamara.

143
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,350
I suppose I could speed it through.

144
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,280
Of course, you know by default,

145
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,863
you both would be named as beneficiaries.

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,980
- So we split it equally 50/50?

147
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,063
(gentle music)

148
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:40,896
(birds chirping)

149
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,860
- Mom, when are we going home?

150
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,053
This place sucks.

151
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,611
- Well, it is certainly not
the way mother described it.

152
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,444
- [Wanda] Well, of course not.

153
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:13,658
Nobody took care of it after daddy died.

154
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:16,325
(gentle music)

155
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,220
- To make things really exciting,

156
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,840
here's an old paint can.

157
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,963
Perhaps left behind by
some ancient civilization.

158
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,620
Maybe there's a slug we
can put on mom's head.

159
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,213
- Oh, look.

160
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,760
Look that must be the
old tractor daddy had.

161
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,860
Oh, he used to talk
about this all the time.

162
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,693
- Uh-huh.

163
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,363
- Mom.

164
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,329
Mom.

165
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:01,250
Mom.

166
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,305
- Gina.
- There's a pathway.

167
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:04,138
- Yeah.

168
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:08,190
(Sarah sighs)

169
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,300
Oh, don't go.

170
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,560
Gina, you'll wreck your outfit.

171
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,830
- The grove suddenly came alive.

172
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,201
A secret passage leading
deep into the nether regions.

173
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:21,385
- [Sarah] Gina wait up.

174
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,776
Gina.

175
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:24,477
(cat mews)
- Oh, look.

176
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:25,883
It's a baby panther.

177
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,923
Did you lose your mother?

178
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,580
- [Sarah] Gina, don't touch that cat.

179
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,683
What the?

180
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:35,438
- Oh, it's daddy's old pecan shack.

181
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:37,583
- I think someone's living in there.

182
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,080
(door creaks)

183
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,913
- Jasper.

184
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:44,630
William, come on babies it's super time.

185
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,480
Mama done made some okra and corn bread.

186
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,313
Skeeter.

187
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,710
Edda Mae, y'all come on now.

188
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,543
- Oh, my gosh.

189
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,513
(leaves rustling)

190
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,883
(birds chirping)

191
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:00,035
- Who in there?

192
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:01,070
(gun firing)
(women gasping)

193
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,477
Y'all get off this land, you hear?

194
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,930
This here is private property!

195
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,817
No trespassing!

196
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:08,010
(birds chirping)

197
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,380
(insects chittering)

198
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,980
I'm warning you.

199
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,380
- Gina don't.
- Who's that?

200
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,223
Who is that?

201
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:17,780
- (stammering) I'm.

202
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,563
- Field Pea is that you?

203
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,230
Praise the Lord that is you.

204
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,450
You done come all the way
from Clearwater to see me.

205
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,657
- [Sarah] Gina.

206
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:31,110
- I ain't seen you since the cotton farm.

207
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,363
- Excuse me?
- Back in Alabama.

208
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:35,090
(Gina stammers)

209
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,583
You do remember, don't you?

210
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,523
Oh, Field Pea,

211
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,203
did they hit you too?

212
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,600
- Ma'am, I think you
have the wrong person.

213
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,730
- You're confusing my
daughter with someone else?

214
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,120
- Don't be silly.

215
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,490
I's knowed Field Pea since
she was knee high to a dog.

216
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,360
- I'm sorry, I didn't quite get your name.

217
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,970
- My name's Lilly, Lilly Cooper.

218
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,583
Any friend of Field Pea's
is a friend of mine.

219
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,910
- Sarah Weatherby this is my sister Wanda.

220
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,230
- Howdy do.
- Hi.

221
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,463
- This is our property.

222
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:08,630
- I beg your pardon.

223
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,120
- Well, our mother's.

224
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,420
- Mrs. Cooper, by any chance,

225
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,914
did you know our mama Mrs. Barnsdow?

226
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,360
- Emma?
- Yes.

227
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,203
- Emma Barnsdow?

228
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:18,540
Sure I know her.

229
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,160
She about road up to Orangeburg.

230
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,410
Stock up on some dry goods for the winter.

231
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,300
Gone be a cold one, you know.

232
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,480
- She let you live here?

233
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,857
- Of course she do.

234
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:30,370
If she ain't back in a few weeks,

235
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,870
I'm gone be mess in a of hot water

236
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,700
trying to get this crop
in before the freeze.

237
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,870
But why?

238
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,067
Who's asking?

239
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,260
- We was just wondering.

240
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,210
- Well, wonder on your own time.

241
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,076
I got a family to feed.

242
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,640
William.

243
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,527
Jenny.

244
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:45,530
(cats mewing)

245
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,349
Lulu Bell, y'all come on now
because it's supper time.

246
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:51,429
(birds chirping)

247
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:54,179
(camera rolling)

248
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:03,270
- I can't believe she's
been living out there.

249
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,790
- That's not right.

250
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,740
It's our place now.

251
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,030
- But mama let her live there.

252
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,560
You know she was always
helping people like that.

253
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,647
- That doesn't mean we have
to be responsible for her.

254
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,920
A woman like that living by
herself she could get hurt.

255
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,170
She's a liability, Wanda.

256
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,670
Besides there'd been property
taxes and maintenance costs.

257
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,290
We can't keep that place up.

258
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,640
- So what are you gonna do?

259
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:28,808
- I don't know.

260
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,698
We can decide tomorrow.

261
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,313
- [Jimmy] I can remember when
you and your little sister

262
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:45,710
were playing in the mud out
behind Watson's Hog Farm.

263
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,800
You used to pull her down there--

264
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,190
- [Sarah] Jimmy, I'm sorry to say,

265
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,290
I have not been doing much of that lately.

266
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:53,813
Based on the price of some of
the other tracks out there,

267
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:57,690
I'm guessing the place
will go for about 150,000,

268
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,830
if we don't parcel, is that correct?

269
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,240
- Yes, well, but I can't guarantee

270
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,330
the prices will hold up now. (laughs)

271
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,987
- Well, then we'll have
to move quickly, won't we?

272
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:08,670
I'd like to put it on the
market as soon as possible.

273
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,720
- Yes, but you understand,

274
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,060
I have to have Wanda's consent.

275
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,110
I can't--
- You'll have Wanda's consent.

276
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,890
I just didn't wanna go
sticking any legal documents

277
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,370
in her face right now.

278
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,840
It's a very bad time, you understand.

279
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,970
- Okay, yeah, sure.

280
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,013
- All right, well, let me know

281
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,270
the minute you have any interests.

282
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,500
I'd like to have this wrapped
up by the end of the week.

283
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,710
- This week yes.

284
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,919
This week.

285
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,919
Yes, thanks.

286
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:34,474
This week.

287
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:37,057
(gentle music)

288
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,910
(birds chirping)

289
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,203
(insects chittering)

290
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,203
- Hello.

291
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,721
Hello anybody home?

292
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,623
Hello anyone?

293
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,737
It's Field Pea.

294
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,237
(cats mewing)

295
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:11,110
- Field Pea, you done missed your train.

296
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,283
- Huh?
- It left about a hour ago.

297
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,440
- So you really live out here?

298
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,253
- Course, I do, me and my family.

299
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,270
- You know that was really cool

300
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,130
how you shot that gun yesterday.

301
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,983
You scared my mom to death.

302
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,150
Oh, not that I wanted you to scare her.

303
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,153
It's just cool how you got
her attention that's all.

304
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,084
- Mm.

305
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:34,584
(cats mewing)

306
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:37,730
What you got there, Field Pea?

307
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,610
You taking pictures?

308
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,670
- Making a movie.

309
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,050
- You always was interested in pictures.

310
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,883
- I was.

311
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,886
You wanna be a movie star, Ms. Copper?

312
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:48,295
- Oh, shh, what I need that for?

313
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,596
- Well, you'll be famous.

314
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:51,179
Get rich and stuff.

315
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,250
- I had a lot of money once.

316
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,701
More than I knew what to do with.

317
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:58,865
- Really?

318
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:00,190
How'd you get it?

319
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,513
- You remember, silly.

320
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,160
It all started that
night that Skinny Babcock

321
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,941
turned that old barn over by
Stony Creek into a dance hall.

322
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:13,780
(Lilly chuckles)

323
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,870
You came all the way
over to Ms. Handleman's

324
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,530
just to help make me up pretty.

325
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,560
Course, everybody was saying

326
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,930
how funny it was that you was my friend.

327
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,200
But you didn't pay them no mind.

328
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,687
You said, "Best friends don't look

329
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,587
"at each other for what's on the outside.

330
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,440
"It's what's on the inside that counts."

331
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,770
So when I decided to get me a husband,

332
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,360
you wanted to help me.

333
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,140
- Now remember act like you
wanna have lots of babies.

334
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,080
Farmers like that.

335
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,853
- I don't want a farmer, Field Pea.

336
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,577
Farmers smell funny.

337
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:46,633
- (laughs) Don't be silly,

338
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,740
and don't be too pushy neither.

339
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,027
Men don't like a woman
with a mind of her own.

340
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:54,273
You just let them do all the talking,

341
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,263
for a while anyway. (giggles)

342
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,647
(lively music plays in hall)

343
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:05,134
(people chattering loudly)

344
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:07,634
(engine revs)

345
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,648
- All right, y'all.

346
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,648
(people chattering)

347
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,980
- [Lilly] You told me don't be shy.

348
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,387
You said, "Find me a good
one and just go and get him.

349
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,047
"Because if I didn't,
somebody else would."

350
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:40,630
(lively dance music plays)

351
00:17:58,694 --> 00:17:59,901
- Excuse me, Miss.

352
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:01,068
Care to dance?

353
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:14,314
- Hey, hey, now.

354
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:15,652
Stay on over here, Henry.

355
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:18,340
(soft jazzy music)

356
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,669
Now, yeah.

357
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,002
You coming over?

358
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,363
- Well, young lady
either you came over here

359
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:40,000
to ask me for a cigarette,

360
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,253
or you'd like to dance.

361
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,402
Which is it?

362
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:49,319
(soft jazzy music)

363
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:31,780
- And my mama she worked
on her daddy's farm.

364
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,680
That's how Field Pea and
me came to be friends.

365
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,059
She did my hair for me, see?

366
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,380
(horn honks on street)

367
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,649
- Darling, be careful this
is the only truck I got.

368
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,560
But that still doesn't
explain how a nice young lady

369
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,810
like yourself learned
to drive an automobile.

370
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,320
- After mama died, I got a job driving

371
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,680
cotton trucks to support myself.

372
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,210
- Mm, you a truck driver, huh?

373
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,163
Well, a skill like that could
come in handy I suppose.

374
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,070
I tell you what, pull on
up to the house yonder,

375
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,520
we'll stretch our legs a
little bit what you say?

376
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,333
Well, now, how do you like my house?

377
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,623
- Oh, Mr. Cooper, it's beautiful.

378
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,420
Where'd you get all your money?

379
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,433
- Well, I'm a businessman, young lady.

380
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,933
So how about a toast?

381
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,294
To the most beautiful lady at the dance.

382
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:25,440
(insects chirping)

383
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,190
(frogs croaking)

384
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,340
- So did you marry him?

385
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,040
Was that how you got the cotton farm?

386
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,163
- Well, Mr. Cooper was a little
older than I had hoped for,

387
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,490
but he had his charm.

388
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,930
- Wow, what a way to meet a guy.

389
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,570
I met Ray at the mall.

390
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,490
He works at a juice bar.

391
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,540
But don't tell mom that.

392
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,260
She doesn't know about him yet.

393
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,680
- No, no, no.

394
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,410
You know, I almost forget.

395
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,600
I been saving something for you.

396
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,850
- [Gina] You have?

397
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,683
- Yep.

398
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:03,071
(birds chirping outside)

399
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,499
(gentle music)

400
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:12,219
- Oh, god.

401
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:13,833
(dramatic music)

402
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,666
Jerry.

403
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,590
(engine revs)

404
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:36,020
(birds chirping)

405
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,319
- Hey, Aunt Wanda.
- Hey, Gina.

406
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:39,080
- Look what she gave me.

407
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,020
I saw that lady again,

408
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,230
and she said that this is the necklace

409
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,710
that we bought together at Woolworths

410
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,350
before she went to this big dance.

411
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,270
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

412
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,990
You went all the way
out there by yourself.

413
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,270
- Yeah, don't tell mom.

414
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,550
- Gina.

415
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,200
- She kept on calling me Field Pea,

416
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,830
and telling me about this guy that she met

417
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,920
and used to live with on this cotton farm

418
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,600
like a jillion years ago.

419
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,590
- Now, Gina, wait a minute.

420
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,010
You think that's a good
idea to go out there again?

421
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,740
- Oh, yeah, she's cool.

422
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,290
She gave me some money to buy her

423
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,670
some stuff like soup and stamps.

424
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,900
- Postage stamps?

425
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,020
- Yeah, it's like I'm some
long-lost friend or something.

426
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,560
It's really weird.

427
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,170
- Wanda, I'm glad to see you.

428
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,460
I got to talk to you about the property.

429
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,990
Hi, darling.

430
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,130
I talked to Jimmy White.

431
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,560
He said if we move quickly,

432
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,262
we could maybe get about a 150 for it.

433
00:22:23,262 --> 00:22:24,095
We'll split that of course.

434
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:26,080
So that's 75 a piece.

435
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,897
So I gave him the go
ahead to find a buyer.

436
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:31,290
- $75,000.

437
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,430
- Pretty nice, huh?

438
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,473
- Well, yeah, if I decide to sell.

439
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,920
- What do you mean?

440
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,770
Why wouldn't you?

441
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,210
- I don't know.

442
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,907
What if I like it?

443
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,920
- [Sarah] Wanda, this is not a joke.

444
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,973
We stand to make a lot of money here.

445
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:48,660
- What about Mrs. Cooper?

446
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,350
- She shouldn't be out there anyway.

447
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,460
I was hoping to get this
wrapped up by end of the week.

448
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,140
- So you can get back
to Atlanta is that it.

449
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,660
You can't stand being here one more day.

450
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,880
You know it's a big decision.

451
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,240
An extra day or two to think about it

452
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,540
isn't gonna hurt anything.

453
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,060
So how long you been
living here, Mrs. Cooper?

454
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,650
- Well, since that old pecan tree fell.

455
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,600
- Oh, I see.

456
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,680
Have you ever thought about

457
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,630
moving someplace a little bigger?

458
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,640
You know, I'm sure the church
could help you find something.

459
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,490
- [Lilly] Oh, no I got a family here.

460
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,973
Ain't that right, Jasper?

461
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,560
(cats mewing)

462
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,270
- [Wanda] How often did you see my mama?

463
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,103
- Who?

464
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,470
- Mrs. Barnsdow from the church.

465
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,840
- Emma?
- Mm-mm.

466
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,800
- All the time.

467
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,200
Matter of fact, she's
supposed to be here tomorrow.

468
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,093
We'll be hiring for the fall soon.

469
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,890
- Mrs. Cooper.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,990
- My mama, Mrs. Barnsdow.

471
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,550
- Mm-hmm.

472
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,430
- You know, she died last week.

473
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,680
Oh, she was real sick.

474
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,513
- No.

475
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,693
Emma's in Orangeburg.

476
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,360
That's just a rumor.

477
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,210
Too much work to be done around here.

478
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,410
- Why don't you tell her
about the cotton farm,

479
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,130
you know, like you were telling me.

480
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,770
- It was the most wonderful
place in the world.

481
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,370
- Did you really have a cotton farm?

482
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,150
- Yes, I did, first home I ever had.

483
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,190
Being an orphan and all,

484
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,580
I never had no proper
place till I met Henry.

485
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,290
- Henry was her husband.

486
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,470
- I was planning on having lots of babies.

487
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,910
That's why when I moved in,

488
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,772
I tried to make sure they'd
have a good home to grow up in.

489
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:21,605
(dramatic music)

490
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,760
But Mr. Cooper had other plans.

491
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,285
With him, it was always work, work, work.

492
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:34,355
- [Henry] Lily.

493
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:37,105
(dramatic music)

494
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:55,913
(engine revs)

495
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,120
- [Wanda] So you were driving that truck

496
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,163
for your husband's business, huh?

497
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:12,142
- [Lilly] Mm-mm, and
sometimes for days on end.

498
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:15,700
Why he'd have me trucking cotton
seed clear into Mississippi

499
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,220
and sometimes to folks that
didn't even look like farmers.

500
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,490
I didn't know who my husband
was doing business with,

501
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,603
but we was doing okay, I suppose.

502
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,050
- [Wanda] Mrs. Cooper it's
been a pleasure talking to you.

503
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,620
- And it's been a pleasure
talking to you too.

504
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,050
- Well, thank you.

505
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,480
- Field Pea, don't forget to
tell Emma about the hiring.

506
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,205
We gone need 12 good workers this year.

507
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,133
- Okay.
- Okay.

508
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:45,190
Oh, oh, oh, Field Pea.

509
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,870
Field Pea, sit this bucket out there

510
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,970
because we sure don't need no more rain

511
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,313
come harvesting time.

512
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,960
- But don't you see?

513
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,590
It's the same thing.

514
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,410
That's who mama got the
story of the bucket from.

515
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,930
Mrs. Cooper told her.

516
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,010
- Yeah.

517
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,843
So.

518
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:04,967
- So, it's just neat that's all.

519
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,223
- Darling,

520
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,153
$75,000 would be neat.

521
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:16,775
(birds chirping)

522
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,525
(engine revving)

523
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:23,350
- And then every year at Christmas,

524
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,073
daddy would give hayrides
to all the children in town.

525
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,883
There're lots of memories out here.

526
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,300
Oh, my goodness that must
be my daddy's old tractor.

527
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,900
- I think there's real
investment potential here.

528
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,100
Something special.

529
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,550
Now if I was to buy this place,

530
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,880
I'd think about clearing
out some of those trees

531
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,570
and putting a house right there.

532
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,750
That way you'd have a view

533
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,790
all the way to Shepherdton County.

534
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,730
- [Boy] Hey, dad.

535
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,140
- [Jimmy] Let me show you.

536
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,000
- Oh, no dear not that way.

537
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,266
Here let me show you this over here.

538
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:57,266
(people chattering in distance)

539
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,540
Hey.

540
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,923
- Oh, you still here, huh?

541
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,320
- Well, I have some good news.

542
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,010
Found a buyer for the land.

543
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,863
- You have?

544
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,780
- The offer's not quite what we asked.

545
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,513
But Jimmy thinks it's fair.

546
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,345
So you wanna hear how much?

547
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:25,630
- (coughs) Sarah, I'm
not selling the land.

548
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,640
You go head sell your half.

549
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,460
- No one's gonna buy half
a pecan grove, Wanda.

550
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,344
- Look it's just not right.

551
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:33,177
- What do you mean?

552
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:35,512
- Well, Mrs. Cooper lives there.

553
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:37,523
We can't just go and kick her off.

554
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,313
She was mama's friend.

555
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:44,780
- Look it is too bad that know one knew

556
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,440
to look after her when mama got sick.

557
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,190
But the truth is that woman should've been

558
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,180
in a nursing home a long time ago.

559
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,850
- We are not putting her
in any nursing home, Sarah.

560
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,120
- She could die out there, Wanda.

561
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,306
Is that what you want?

562
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,420
For crying out loud,

563
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,270
she could waste away by
herself in that shack!

564
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,520
- And what would you care?

565
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,060
You want me to believe
you care more about her

566
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,560
than you did about our own mother!

567
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,040
- I cared about other mother.

568
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,627
- You show up here after
three years acting like,

569
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:08,570
"Oh everything's just fine."

570
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,147
- I had obligations you know that!

571
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,093
- Mother needed you!

572
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:13,370
- What happened was between mother and me!

573
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,530
It had nothing to do with you!

574
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,277
- Oh, like hell it didn't!

575
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,353
You abandoned her, our own mother.

576
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,353
I am not selling that land, Sarah.

577
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,010
- Well, yeah, but just because you own it,

578
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,750
doesn't mean that I can go
out there and throw her off.

579
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,629
She's got squatter's rights.

580
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:38,240
- What are those exactly?

581
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,330
- Well, if she's been out there

582
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,420
as long as you think she has,

583
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,520
she's got a right to stay.

584
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,717
- That's ridiculous I own the property.

585
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:45,880
- Well, now you may have the title,

586
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,520
but that lady's got a homestead.

587
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,240
Nothing either one of you
can do about the other,

588
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,010
unless she dies or just moves on.

589
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,421
- But she's not well.

590
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:54,890
She needs help.

591
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,720
- Well, that may be.

592
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,080
She got any family?

593
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,290
- I don't know.

594
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,800
- Well, unless she
decides to go on her own,

595
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,230
there's really nothing
you can do about it,

596
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,620
because by law it requires a family member

597
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,190
to admit her to a nursing home.

598
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:15,003
- Jerry she can stay out
there as long as she wants.

599
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,743
I'm telling you it is useless.

600
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:24,913
(stammering) No, it's not possible.

601
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,633
All right.

602
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:31,583
I'll be home tomorrow.

603
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,543
- Is daddy coming?

604
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,443
- [Sarah] No, Gina.

605
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:47,610
- Can we go out and see Mrs. Cooper?

606
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,070
- Why would we go out and see her?

607
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,370
- Because she's my friend.

608
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,130
- How can she be your friend?

609
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,393
You've only seen her once.

610
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,520
Wait have you been going out there?

611
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,823
With Wanda.

612
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,493
Oh, terrific.

613
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:10,850
(suitcase unzipping)

614
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,070
- Well, what's wrong with that?

615
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,700
Mrs. Cooper's neat.

616
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,890
- That woman has made things

617
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,790
very difficult for your father and me.

618
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,210
We're going home tomorrow.

619
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,690
- We can't.

620
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,190
She needs me.

621
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,970
I'm her only friend.

622
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,430
- [Sarah] Gina.

623
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,720
- Just one more visit, please mother,

624
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,740
so I can say goodbye.

625
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,603
We could take her some groceries,

626
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:39,863
at least we could do that.

627
00:30:42,335 --> 00:30:45,600
(Sarah scoffs)

628
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,010
Her whole family has a name

629
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,410
every one of them right Mrs. Cooper.

630
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,957
- Yeah.

631
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:52,900
(door thuds)
- Well, that's fine.

632
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,050
- Thank you so much, honey.

633
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,302
That's awful sweet of
you, appreciate that.

634
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:58,690
(birds chirping)

635
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,110
- Say goodbye, Gina,
we got to hit the road.

636
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,303
- Mother.
- Gina.

637
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:06,964
- Bye, Mrs. Cooper.
- Goodbye, darling.

638
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,033
Good bless you.

639
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:12,253
- Well, looks like I'm too late.

640
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,968
What's going on here, hmm?

641
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,370
- Gina and I were just about to leave.

642
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,520
- Oh, you were?
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,990
- Well, why does Gina have to go?

644
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,040
She could just stay with me and Eddie,

645
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,583
you know, till school starts.

646
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,070
- I don't think so.

647
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,490
Besides, I don't appreciate
your bringing her out here

648
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,960
without my knowing it.

649
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,501
Come on, Gina.

650
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:34,501
- Goodbye, Aunt Wanda.
- Bye, Gina.

651
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:36,781
- (gasping) Oh, look at that.

652
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:38,655
Look at that it's a baby.

653
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:40,172
It's a baby.

654
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:43,630
Oh, my it's a baby.

655
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,862
- Are you okay, Mrs. Cooper?

656
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,212
- Yes, darling.
- You wanna hold her?

657
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:48,418
- Can I hold her?
- Sure.

658
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:49,865
This is Ruby.

659
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:53,321
Yeah, Ruby's my pride and
joy, aren't you, darling?

660
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:54,498
- I had a baby once.

661
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:55,573
- You did?

662
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:56,523
- A little boy.

663
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,473
Upset his daddy though.

664
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:02,790
I found out after we got married

665
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,853
that me and Mr. Cooper
had different ideas.

666
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,697
Raising a family wasn't one of his.

667
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:15,366
My baby, little baby. (sobs)

668
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,531
I loved the babies.

669
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:20,270
(somber music)

670
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,501
(thunder rumbling)

671
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:25,084
(wind blowing)

672
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:34,428
(thunder rumbling)

673
00:32:34,428 --> 00:32:37,261
(dramatic music)

674
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:56,798
- Lily.

675
00:32:57,757 --> 00:32:58,590
Lily.

676
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:07,939
(thunder crashing)

677
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:16,984
(heavy gasping)

678
00:33:26,581 --> 00:33:29,596
(heavy gasping)

679
00:33:29,596 --> 00:33:32,513
(car horn blaring)

680
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,180
(tense music)
(Lilly gasps)

681
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:45,195
(suspenseful music)

682
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:51,326
(Lilly gasping deeply)

683
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:02,656
- Miss.

684
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,760
Miss, you all right?

685
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,630
Let me help you come here.

686
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,123
Let's get around here.

687
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:14,026
All right, ma'am, get up here.

688
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:15,570
Lean on this.

689
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,196
There you go.

690
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:19,995
(Lilly gasping deeply)

691
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:22,315
You running moonshine?

692
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:23,710
Lucile, she needs help.

693
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,537
Come on help me here.

694
00:34:25,537 --> 00:34:26,968
Get her.

695
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,627
Get her to the car.

696
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:30,710
Come on ma'am we got you.

697
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,366
(baby crying)

698
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:43,624
(dramatic music)

699
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,056
- It's okay, ma'am.

700
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:47,394
It's okay.

701
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:49,894
(baby crying)

702
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:55,141
- Here's you little boy, Miss.

703
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,580
He's okay.

704
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,420
(tender music)

705
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,443
- My baby.

706
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,123
God bless you.

707
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,170
God bless you both.

708
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,167
- So what happened?

709
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:16,003
What did you do?

710
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,770
- Yeah, Mrs. Cooper, about
your son where is he?

711
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,350
- Wherever he is I know he's all right.

712
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,183
- Well, where is he?

713
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:28,399
Is he still alive?

714
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:29,649
- I don't know.

715
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:32,864
- What do you mean you don't know?

716
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,764
- It's okay you don't have to tell us.

717
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,725
- [Wanda] We'll, see you
tomorrow is that okay?

718
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:41,930
(dramatic music)

719
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,763
- Let's go.

720
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:45,610
- Goodbye, Mrs. Cooper.

721
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,823
I'll be back I promise.

722
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:50,686
(Lilly sobs)

723
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,222
- That woman is absolutely nuts.

724
00:36:03,222 --> 00:36:04,700
But thank heavens she has a son.

725
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,853
- Why do you care?

726
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,117
Oh, I gotta say goodbye to Aunt Wanda.

727
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:10,490
- You don't have to.

728
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,323
We're staying.

729
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,180
You have a phone number
for anyone named Cooper.

730
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,873
Mm-mm, Cypress, Alabama.

731
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,690
Yep, whatever you got.

732
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,940
(door closing)
Just one.

733
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,433
Thanks.

734
00:36:29,294 --> 00:36:31,070
All right you keep calling these,

735
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,500
and if you find anything, call me.

736
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,440
- Wait, where are you going?

737
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,273
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.

738
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:39,660
There must be something.

739
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,840
- No, the only Henry Cooper I can find

740
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,210
from Alabama that matches your information

741
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,890
he died in 1972.

742
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,963
But he was born back in 1890,

743
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:50,920
so that makes him a
little old to be her son.

744
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,530
- That must be her husband.

745
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,900
From what she was saying,

746
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,990
I'm guessing her son to be about 50.

747
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,050
- No, there's no record Mr. or Mrs.

748
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,610
ever had a child together.

749
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,760
- There isn't?
- No ma'am.

750
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,110
Believe me, I looked at every database

751
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,280
and every county down there.

752
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,170
If a person had ever
set foot in that state

753
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,983
dead or alive, I'd find him for you.

754
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:12,070
I am a tax assessor.

755
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,890
Are you sure that woman
ever really had a son?

756
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,463
What else has she been telling you?

757
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,903
- Now did you know I'm
a nurse, Mrs. Cooper?

758
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,913
I'm over at Fairview Hospital,

759
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,520
and from what I can tell,

760
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,150
you better watch this because
it's getting infected.

761
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,100
Now.

762
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,160
- Nothing but a little scratch.

763
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,363
- Yeah, well, you gotta be careful now.

764
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,550
When is the last time you saw a doctor?

765
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,023
- I don't need no doctor
because I ain't sick.

766
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:44,390
(cat mewing)
(birds chirping)

767
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,923
Everything gone look so
pretty when he gets here.

768
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,653
He'll have a good home to grow up in.

769
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,100
- Your son?

770
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,522
Well, I thought you said that--

771
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,422
- He'll be here any day now I know it.

772
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:00,732
(door creaks)

773
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:03,232
(cats mewing)

774
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,066
- Mrs. Cooper, where is he?

775
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,580
(thunder rumbling)

776
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,473
Is he coming?

777
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,303
- Did you really have a son, Mrs. Cooper?

778
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,723
- He was the sweetest thing.

779
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,493
He never caused me one bit of trouble,

780
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,093
and that smile,

781
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,240
that smile on his face,

782
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,180
and it was brightest on Sunday morning

783
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,990
when I was taking him to church.

784
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,190
- [Wanda] What happened
to him, Mrs. Cooper?

785
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:51,394
(dramatic music)

786
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:56,557
(Lilly hums softly)

787
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:01,040
- Lily.

788
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,070
(dog barking in distance)

789
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,770
You got time to lounge
around the house all day.

790
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,730
You can make them deliveries
over in Mississippi.

791
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,334
Now the neighbor's gonna watch
the baby while you're gone

792
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:12,980
because I ain't got time to mess with him.

793
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,813
- The neighbor?

794
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,215
He can't take my baby.

795
00:39:18,215 --> 00:39:19,750
- Oh, come on now, woman,
it's gone be all right.

796
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,663
- No, I ain't gone leave him I won't.

797
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,720
I know what you doing.

798
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,130
I seen what you got in them bags,

799
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,083
and it ain't legal.

800
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,687
- Let me tell you something.

801
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,347
How you think we got his house
that you love so much, huh?

802
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:41,800
Now you go do something stupid,

803
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,923
we could lose everything we got.

804
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:47,517
You wouldn't want that for
little Henry now would you?

805
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:50,386
So come on.

806
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:53,219
(dramatic music)

807
00:40:04,427 --> 00:40:08,344
Come on you it's gone be
all right now come on.

808
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:13,518
I'll talk to you next week.

809
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:29,028
(bird squawks in distance)

810
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:31,861
(dramatic music)

811
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:44,195
- Hi.

812
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:45,028
Hi, baby.

813
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:47,244
Hi.

814
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:50,953
It's okay, honey.

815
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:52,470
It's okay.

816
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,103
Mama ain't gone leave you again.

817
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:56,920
I promise.

818
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,806
(dramatic music)

819
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:00,453
(people chattering in distance)

820
00:41:00,453 --> 00:41:05,453
(typewriter keys clacking in office)

821
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,413
Excuse me.

822
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:07,610
Excuse me, sir.

823
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,443
- Yes, ma'am.

824
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,742
Mrs. Lily, what can I do for you?

825
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:13,100
(ominous music)

826
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,380
- Sir, my husband is a moonshiner.

827
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,460
I know because he makes me
deliver his liquor for him.

828
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,895
He hides it in bags of cotton seed.

829
00:41:22,895 --> 00:41:24,655
- In cotton seed.

830
00:41:24,655 --> 00:41:26,072
Hm-mm, come here.

831
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:32,175
(telephones ringing in station)

832
00:41:32,175 --> 00:41:34,782
(dramatic music)

833
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:38,277
- He makes it in his barn at night time.

834
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:40,897
I don't want my boy
being raised around him.

835
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,740
I'm ready to talk to whoever you want.

836
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,090
I can tell them everything.

837
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,140
- Now that won't be necessary, ma'am.

838
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,590
I'll tell you what.

839
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,020
You go on home and you act
like nothing ever happened.

840
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,853
I'll get my men together,

841
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:52,804
and we'll come over there tonight.

842
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:55,235
But don't you let on a
word to nobody, you hear?

843
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:56,668
- Yes, sir.

844
00:41:56,668 --> 00:41:58,368
- Don't wanna scare him now do we?

845
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:00,837
Yeah, go on.

846
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:05,021
(suspenseful music)

847
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,594
(insects chittering)
(dramatic music)

848
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:12,344
(doors thudding)

849
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:27,870
- It's gone be fine.

850
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,620
(dramatic music)

851
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:50,348
- Well, lookie here.
(ominous music)

852
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:51,490
Where you going so fast?

853
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,010
Hold on now.

854
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,474
Nobody gonna hurt you, Mrs. Cooper.

855
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:55,560
Look at little Henry.
(baby crying)

856
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,477
Look how scared he is let
me see that little baby.

857
00:42:56,477 --> 00:42:58,900
- What are you doing?

858
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,930
No, my baby give me my son!

859
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,864
- You ain't got no son.
- Give me my son.

860
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:03,975
Don't want him growing up with his daddy.

861
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:05,760
I'll take care of that right now.

862
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,761
- Henry!
- Get that baby out of here.

863
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:08,800
(Henry screaming)

864
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,804
Hey.
- Henry!

865
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:10,854
- Get her.

866
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,854
- Henry, give me my son!

867
00:43:13,783 --> 00:43:15,800
Give me my son!
(Henry screaming)

868
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,283
- Since you ain't got enough
sense to keep her quiet

869
00:43:17,283 --> 00:43:18,560
then I sure will.

870
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
You're damn lucky I got here when I did!

871
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,263
Get her in the car.
- Henry, Henry!

872
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,429
- [Gina] What happened
where did they take him?

873
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:27,262
- I don't know.

874
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,510
- [Wanda] Does your husband have him,

875
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,032
or did they put him in a home?

876
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:33,865
- (sobs) I don't know.

877
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:35,365
- Oh, Mrs. Cooper.

878
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:39,230
(dramatic music)

879
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,052
- Do you think you could find him?

880
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,469
Can you find him?

881
00:43:45,762 --> 00:43:46,595
- Yes.

882
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:49,800
Field Pea will find him.

883
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,300
- (sobs) Thank you, baby.

884
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,150
- I'm telling you, sheriff,
the woman is crazy.

885
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,430
She said she had a son,

886
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,550
but there's no birth certificate,

887
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,333
no death certificate, nothing.

888
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,750
You should see the place she's living.

889
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,990
There's no running water.

890
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,570
No electricity.
- Mrs. Weatherby.

891
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,433
- She could also be dangerous!

892
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,860
She has a gun.

893
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,803
I've seen it.

894
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,050
- Now there's no law against that.

895
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,330
- Unless she's used it on
somebody or threatened someone.

896
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,600
- She has, Sheriff.

897
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,973
She has threatened my daughter and me.

898
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:27,748
(telephone ringing)

899
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:29,763
- Hello.

900
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,653
Gina.

901
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,813
She did.

902
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,790
Oh, my gosh, I'll be right there.

903
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,430
Okay, bye.

904
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,263
- [Eddie] Baby, what's wrong.

905
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:42,393
- I gotta go down to the grove.

906
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:43,780
It's Mrs. Cooper.

907
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,437
- She all right, do you me to do anything?

908
00:44:45,437 --> 00:44:46,980
- It's between me and Sarah.

909
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,083
You just watch Ruby I'll be back shortly.

910
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,643
- Now please ma'am we just
want a few words with you.

911
00:44:56,787 --> 00:44:57,620
This is ridiculous.

912
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,130
That thing probably won't even shoot.

913
00:44:59,130 --> 00:44:59,963
- Yes, it will.

914
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:03,407
(car engine revving)

915
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:04,240
- Mrs. Cooper.

916
00:45:05,515 --> 00:45:07,577
Don't make it any worse
now put the gun down.

917
00:45:07,577 --> 00:45:10,050
Now Mrs. Cooper all we
wanna do is talk to you.

918
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:10,963
Mrs. Cooper.

919
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,460
I gotta a social worker out there with me,

920
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,370
and she just wants to
make sure you're okay.

921
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,693
- What's going on here?

922
00:45:20,293 --> 00:45:22,600
There is nothing wrong with her.

923
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,240
- [Sheriff] She just wants
to make sure you're okay.

924
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,901
Now maybe she can help you
with your living arrangement.

925
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:28,050
- No, she wasn't need any help.

926
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,907
- Put your your stuff down.

927
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:30,300
Now you shouldn't be doing this.

928
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,829
- [Sarah] Wanda.

929
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,040
- It's okay.

930
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,120
It's just me.

931
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,953
I'm here.

932
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,953
All right.

933
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,510
Come on.

934
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,350
Now listen nothing's
gonna happen all right.

935
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,172
I'm not gonna let it.

936
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:45,890
Here just give me that.

937
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,337
You're not gonna need that.

938
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,035
That's it.

939
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:53,118
There you go.

940
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,300
- Now, ma'am I understand you have a son

941
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,880
that might could help us out here.

942
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,117
Now all we want--
- You ain't got no son!

943
00:45:59,117 --> 00:46:00,766
- Give me my son!
- Stay with me, ma'am.

944
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:03,683
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

945
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,728
- Come with us.
- Let go of her.

946
00:46:06,728 --> 00:46:07,719
- Easy.
- No!

947
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:09,110
- Let go of her.
- Easy now.

948
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,501
(suspenseful music)

949
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,875
- No, no let me go!
- Stop that!

950
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:12,875
- Let me go!

951
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:14,664
No!

952
00:46:14,664 --> 00:46:16,211
Henry.

953
00:46:16,211 --> 00:46:17,647
No, let me go!

954
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:19,540
- [Wanda] You're hurting her!

955
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,585
- She's not well!

956
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:21,433
- How dare you.

957
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:22,700
- I am trying to help.

958
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,567
- You have never helped
anyone but yourself.

959
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:25,910
(dramatic music)

960
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,785
- No!

961
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,993
- Where are you talking her?
- No!

962
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:30,847
Leave me alone!

963
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:32,503
Leave me alone!
- It's okay, it's okay.

964
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:33,991
- Leave me alone!
- Watch your head.

965
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,624
(Henry screaming)
- Get in there!

966
00:46:35,624 --> 00:46:38,902
- Oh, my baby!

967
00:46:38,902 --> 00:46:40,435
Give me my baby.

968
00:46:40,435 --> 00:46:41,821
Give me my baby.

969
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:42,949
Give me my baby.

970
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:44,282
Give me my baby!

971
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:50,327
(police siren blaring)

972
00:46:57,538 --> 00:46:58,680
(birds chirping)

973
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,513
- Gina.

974
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,023
G, are you okay?

975
00:47:07,563 --> 00:47:08,930
- I hate her, I just hate her.

976
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,303
- Oh, honey.

977
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:14,373
- Why is she doing this?

978
00:47:15,675 --> 00:47:16,933
We used to be friends.

979
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,353
Now it's like I don't exist.

980
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:24,603
- I know she used to be my friend too, G.

981
00:47:24,603 --> 00:47:28,423
Oh, gosh I hope I didn't put
you two at odds over this.

982
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,127
But she still is your mother.

983
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:32,410
You gotta respect that.

984
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,633
- It's hard.
- I know.

985
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:36,160
- She acting so strange lately.

986
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,070
She didn't tell me that she
was leaving till this morning.

987
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,610
- She went back to Atlanta?

988
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,310
- She said she had to be with dad.

989
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,550
How's Mrs. Cooper?

990
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,640
She okay?

991
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,920
- Oh, well, she just keeps

992
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,767
talking about her friend Field Pea.

993
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:51,640
"Where's Field Pea", she says.

994
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,860
Yeah, she's at the hospital.

995
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,610
They're doing some
psychological tests on her.

996
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,710
But so far they haven't found
anything wrong with her.

997
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,790
Of course, everybody thinks
she's a little crazy.

998
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,303
But there's no law against that, right?

999
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:07,920
You know why don't we find
something to take to her

1000
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,260
after supper tonight, huh,

1001
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,850
make her feel more at home?

1002
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:11,950
Come on let's do that.

1003
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,786
- How long will I have with him?

1004
00:48:18,786 --> 00:48:20,040
- A few minutes.

1005
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,920
I've been with him all morning.

1006
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,120
He's not doing so great.

1007
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,270
- He's cooperated with the
investigation in every way.

1008
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,290
There's no reason for this.

1009
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,433
- I'm sorry, Sarah.

1010
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,843
- Jail.

1011
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,120
Isn't it your job to keep him out?

1012
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,960
- We're doing what we can.

1013
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,350
Now if you come up with the bail,

1014
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,400
we'll arrange for him to go home tonight.

1015
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,893
Sarah, are you okay?

1016
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:19,370
- Don, you mind?

1017
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,203
- Sure.

1018
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:24,373
- Oh, Jerry.

1019
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,760
(door creaks)

1020
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,903
- Well, I guess we knew this was coming.

1021
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,260
- This is so...

1022
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,037
How did he let this happen?

1023
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,290
- He stalled as long as he could, Sarah.

1024
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:53,463
I had to turn myself in or
risk being arrested somewhere.

1025
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,740
So how's it going?

1026
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,810
Have you talked to Wanda?

1027
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,393
Have you come up with anything?

1028
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,168
- No.

1029
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:08,513
- Nothing at all?

1030
00:50:09,562 --> 00:50:11,111
- No.

1031
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:14,150
- Well, there has to be
something that you can do.

1032
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,963
How long do you think I can sit in here?

1033
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,963
- Jerry, I'm doing everything I can.

1034
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,450
My sister will probably
never speak to me again.

1035
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:32,290
And Gina god knows how I
wanna tell her about this.

1036
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,133
She has no idea.

1037
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,463
I don't know what to do anymore.

1038
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,553
Tell me what's right.

1039
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,041
I wanna do what's right.

1040
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:57,041
(locks disengaging)

1041
00:50:58,890 --> 00:50:59,723
- Jerry.

1042
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:03,164
(Sarah sighs)

1043
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,270
- You have to get me out of here.

1044
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,353
- How?

1045
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:13,250
How?

1046
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:17,343
(sobbing gently)

1047
00:51:19,314 --> 00:51:22,785
- [Operator] Dr. Collins
call urology lab B.

1048
00:51:22,785 --> 00:51:25,368
Dr. Collins call urology lab B.

1049
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:27,880
- [Wanda] Hi.

1050
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,303
- Mrs. Cooper, looks
like you have company.

1051
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,610
Just had her dinner.

1052
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:36,860
- [Wanda] How's she doing?

1053
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,030
- She still has periods of confusion.

1054
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,833
They gonna do some more blood
work before they let her go.

1055
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,150
- Mrs. Cooper, we're here.

1056
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,673
We bought you some things.

1057
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,553
It's Field Pea, Mrs. Cooper.

1058
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:57,001
- Field Pea.

1059
00:51:58,234 --> 00:52:00,291
Field Pea, you come to save me.

1060
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:02,296
- Save you from what?

1061
00:52:02,296 --> 00:52:05,217
(Lilly gasps deeply)

1062
00:52:05,217 --> 00:52:07,800
(somber music)

1063
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,639
(machines whirring)

1064
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:14,132
- Lily, Lily.

1065
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,734
We're going to try and relax you a bit.

1066
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:18,734
Everything will be okay.

1067
00:52:30,421 --> 00:52:33,171
(Lilly mumbling)

1068
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,830
- Did you find him?

1069
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:36,893
Did you find my son?

1070
00:52:38,709 --> 00:52:40,790
- Your son is with the neighbors, ma'am.

1071
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,180
He's okay.

1072
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,290
They're going to take care of him

1073
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,070
until you're well enough to go home.

1074
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,380
- But I'm better already.

1075
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,685
- No, sheriff says you've
gotta say here a while.

1076
00:52:49,685 --> 00:52:52,518
(dramatic music)

1077
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,083
Why don't you write your son a letter.

1078
00:52:59,412 --> 00:53:02,167
(Lilly gasps)

1079
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:03,917
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1080
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,893
Mr. Cooper.

1081
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:09,230
(Lilly groans)

1082
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,640
You said they gave your son to a neighbor.

1083
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,501
Do you remember his name?

1084
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:14,886
(Lilly groans)

1085
00:53:14,886 --> 00:53:16,263
- No.

1086
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:17,210
- All right.

1087
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,363
No, it's okay, shh.

1088
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:22,168
(dramatic music)

1089
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,700
There's gotta be a way we can find out

1090
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,010
who that neighbor was.

1091
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,200
- Maybe if she can
remember where she lived.

1092
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,573
What street she was on.

1093
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,593
- Hi, Gina.

1094
00:53:38,407 --> 00:53:39,814
Wanda, could I talk to you a minute?

1095
00:53:39,814 --> 00:53:41,564
- No, I have nothing to say to you.

1096
00:53:44,306 --> 00:53:46,670
You have no idea who
you're dealing with here.

1097
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,980
She has made this whole thing up.

1098
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,623
- What are you talking about?

1099
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,620
- I didn't know how to
break this to you earlier,

1100
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,560
but I talked to a guy at
the tax assessor's office.

1101
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,740
He said there is no record that
Mrs. Cooper ever had a son.

1102
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,840
I am so sorry.

1103
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,700
- Well, that's a lie.

1104
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,010
- She doesn't have a son.

1105
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,403
- Yes, she does.

1106
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,850
- Mrs. Cooper you don't have a son do you?

1107
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,510
- Sarah.
- Mom.

1108
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,440
- Please tell the truth.

1109
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,550
You don't have a son.

1110
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,200
- [Sheriff] You ain't got no son.

1111
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,814
- Give me my little Henry!

1112
00:54:17,814 --> 00:54:18,647
Henry!

1113
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:20,096
(suspenseful music)
No, give me my baby.

1114
00:54:20,096 --> 00:54:22,513
No, my baby, give me my baby!

1115
00:54:24,436 --> 00:54:26,072
- It's all right little fella.

1116
00:54:26,072 --> 00:54:27,244
(Henry crying)

1117
00:54:27,244 --> 00:54:29,489
Mr. Boyd will take care of you.

1118
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:30,499
(Henry crying)

1119
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:32,500
The sheriff want you to stay
with Mr. Boyd for a while.

1120
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,353
- Mr. Boyd.

1121
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:41,770
They gave my baby to Mr. D.W. Boyd.

1122
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,350
- She remembered.

1123
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:47,750
- What is she talking about?

1124
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,160
- Boyd you said?

1125
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,493
(Lilly panting)

1126
00:54:54,493 --> 00:54:58,850
(Lilly sobbing)
(gentle music)

1127
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:01,522
- How many Boyd's can there be in Alabama?

1128
00:55:01,522 --> 00:55:02,510
- It's all right sweetheart.

1129
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,760
We'll try again tomorrow.

1130
00:55:05,163 --> 00:55:07,680
- You know what if he
doesn't live there anymore?

1131
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,310
What if he's somewhere else.

1132
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,290
- Hello.
- Hi, my name is Gina.

1133
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,840
I got your number from information.

1134
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,740
I'm looking for someone named D.W. Boyd

1135
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,270
and I was wondering if by any chance

1136
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:17,300
you're related to him.

1137
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,950
- [Man] You got the wrong number.

1138
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,603
- Come on, I'll fix us a snack, huh?

1139
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,780
Let's see.

1140
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,090
What looks good?

1141
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,210
- [Man] Hello.

1142
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,830
- Hi, I'm looking for D.W. Boyd.

1143
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,510
You're not related to him are you?

1144
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,860
- Yeah.
- You are?

1145
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,930
- [Man] Uh, yes, I am.

1146
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,280
He's my great uncle.

1147
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,760
- He is!

1148
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,069
- [Man] Why are you with the IRS?

1149
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:43,480
- No, no don't hang up please!

1150
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,680
I'm looking for somebody
that he knew a long time ago.

1151
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,109
A little boy named Henry Cooper.

1152
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:49,240
- I know a Henry.

1153
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,211
My great uncle raised him.

1154
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:53,030
- Is he alive is he okay?

1155
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,187
- Well, I suppose, I
hadn't seen him in a while.

1156
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:57,550
- Well, do you know where he is?

1157
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,730
- [Man] Last I heard he was
working on a river barge

1158
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,070
here in Alabama somewhere.

1159
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,060
- He's in Alabama!

1160
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,280
We can find him y'all.

1161
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,369
Thank you so much!

1162
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:06,790
- See she has a son.
- Do you know how

1163
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:08,240
I can reach him?
- Good.

1164
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,736
Mrs. Cooper's gone need a place to live,

1165
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:11,768
because I sold the land.

1166
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,518
(ominous music)

1167
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,160
- Look, Sarah, I don't
care who this buyer is

1168
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,993
or where you found him.

1169
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:24,270
Until you have my signature,

1170
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,110
there is no sale, you understand that?

1171
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,870
We gotta find Mrs. Cooper's son.

1172
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,280
She's been waiting for
this her whole life.

1173
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,080
Can't you see how important this is?

1174
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,630
- So Mr. Boyd said that
he would leave a message

1175
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,970
for your son at church.

1176
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:39,960
- Praise the Lord.

1177
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,217

1178
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:45,630
Is he coming?

1179
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:46,880
- Well, we hope so.

1180
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,530
We won't know for sure
till he calls us back.

1181
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:50,363
- Well, why wouldn't he?

1182
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:51,780
I'm his mama.

1183
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,630
- Oh, he will.

1184
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,321
I know he will.

1185
00:56:54,321 --> 00:56:55,154
- Field Pea.

1186
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:57,710
- How did you meet our mama?

1187
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,010
I mean how did you end
up on that pecan grove?

1188
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,367
- Field Pea remember, don't you baby?

1189
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,264
(dramatic music)

1190
00:57:07,264 --> 00:57:08,514
- Lilly Cooper.

1191
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:13,447
(bright music)

1192
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,000
- You've been here so long.

1193
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,263
How did you manage?

1194
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:20,733
I'm so sorry.

1195
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,260
We've been out of the country.

1196
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,270
I had no idea until I got your letter.

1197
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,995
I'm so sorry.

1198
00:57:27,995 --> 00:57:28,995
- Field Pea.

1199
00:57:33,276 --> 00:57:35,660
- So would you like to come
and stay with Bob and me

1200
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,153
for a little while till you
get your feet on the ground?

1201
00:57:39,145 --> 00:57:39,978
- Huh?

1202
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,580
- My husband and I would like you to come

1203
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,330
and live with us in South Carolina.

1204
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:48,124
Hey, sweetie.

1205
00:57:48,124 --> 00:57:50,874
You'd like that wanna you, Lilly?

1206
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:53,923
- I can't.

1207
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:56,483
I gotta go home.

1208
00:57:56,483 --> 00:57:57,823
I gotta find my baby.

1209
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:05,091
(engines revving)

1210
00:58:05,091 --> 00:58:08,008
(bus horn honking)

1211
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,970
- Now, bus 493 goes straight
to Clearwater Alabama.

1212
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:14,040
But it doesn't leave till midnight.

1213
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,030
Are you sure you still wanna wait?

1214
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,817
I just hate that you
won't let me drive you.

1215
00:58:17,817 --> 00:58:18,650
- No, I'll be fine.

1216
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,253
You go on now.

1217
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,567
I got me a sandwich

1218
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:26,343
and I'm gone sit over here and wait.

1219
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:31,446
- Well, you don't have to be
so darn stubborn about it.

1220
00:58:31,446 --> 00:58:32,279
Here.

1221
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,130
If it doesn't work out down
there, this is my address,

1222
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,313
and I want you to come
and see me right away.

1223
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:42,767
I've missed you.

1224
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,473
Promise you'll write.

1225
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,894
Kiss Miss Lilly goodbye.

1226
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:53,646

1227
00:58:53,646 --> 00:58:54,979

1232
00:59:29,257 --> 00:59:32,803
- [Operator] Bus leaving for
Savannah and all points north.

1233
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:39,187

1234
00:59:39,187 --> 00:59:40,020

1235
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:43,966
Henry.

1236
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:47,753

1245
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:05,953
Hi, kitty.

Thank you.

1255
01:02:17,293 --> 01:02:19,110
I've been thinking.

1256
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,763
Thank you, but I can't stay here.

1257
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,570
That sheriff might find me

1258
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:28,464
and my husband.

1259
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:30,880
- Well, you can't just wander,

1260
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,410
from place to place all the time.

1261
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,630
It's not safe.

1262
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,630
- I'll be all right.

1263
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:36,770
- Well, I won't have it.

1264
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,860
If you're worried about that sheriff,

1265
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,433
you can stay in the pecan grove.

1266
01:02:42,433 --> 01:02:45,410
There's a caretaker shack out
there that you could have.

1267
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:47,289
No one could find you.

1268
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:49,956
(bright music)

1269
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,616
(workers chattering)

1270
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:55,020
Well, I'm afraid it's not much,

1271
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,343
but you stay here as long as you like.

1272
01:02:57,343 --> 01:02:59,867
- (gasps) I'll take good care of it too.

1273
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,280
I can send for my son once I saved up.

1274
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:11,031
(bright music)

1275
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:16,847
- I wish I knew how to help you, Lilly.

1276
01:03:16,847 --> 01:03:19,068
I'm so sorry I can't do more.

1277
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:20,670
- I'm fine.

1278
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,963
You done plenty already.

1279
01:03:23,116 --> 01:03:25,150
- I promise not to tell
a soul you're here.

1280
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:25,983
Right Emma.

1281
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:31,303
- A while back,

1282
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:33,893
Emma she come to me,

1283
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,647
and she say her mama can't come here

1284
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:40,203
because she got the cancer.

1285
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:46,000
But I know Field Pea never leave us.

1286
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,420
She always come back.

1287
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,110
So I told Emma we have to
take care of this grove

1288
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:54,423
till you mama come home.

1289
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,437
And sure enough,

1290
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,743
here she is.

1291
01:04:01,353 --> 01:04:03,784
A good friend never leaves you.

1292
01:04:03,784 --> 01:04:05,450
- All right, wait.

1293
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,380
Emma.
- Hmm?

1294
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,343
- Our Emma.

1295
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,190
Our mother Emma Barnsdow.

1296
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,023
- Mm-mm.

1297
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:17,650
- And Emma's mother was Field Pea.

1298
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:20,710
- Of course, that's only a nickname.

1299
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:23,870
Field Pea proper name Edith.

1300
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:26,010
- Edith. (laughs)

1301
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,530
Oh my gosh.

1302
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,040
That's Edith Simpkins.

1303
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,783
That's your great grandmother.

1304
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:32,840
- You saying our mother

1305
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,910
let you live out there
without telling anyone.

1306
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,809
- Oh, I made her promise.

1307
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:40,923
I couldn't have that sheriff
and my husband finding me.

1308
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:45,203
Then, a couple of years back,

1309
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,700
Emma she come to me and she say

1310
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,782
she tired of fooling with the place,

1311
01:04:51,782 --> 01:04:53,890
and she want me to have it,

1312
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,623
while I'm waiting on Field Pea and my boy.

1313
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,675
That's when she give it to me.

1314
01:05:00,675 --> 01:05:01,508
- What?

1315
01:05:01,508 --> 01:05:02,834
- [Wanda] She gave it to you.

1316
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,000
- Sure did.

1317
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,900
She gave me the papers and everything.

1318
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,353
She's a sweet little thing.

1319
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,320
She still comes out every season

1320
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,903
help me with the harvesting.

1321
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:18,310
We're gonna have a good one
this year, huh, Field Pea.

1322
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,837
- We sure are.

1323
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:24,790
- It's all gone be Henry's someday.

1324
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:28,390
This money I done saved
from selling these pecans,

1325
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:29,393
and the land,

1326
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:32,883
I'm gone give it all to
him when he get here.

1327
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,223
- So that's why it wasn't in the will.

1328
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,560
Mother had already given it away.

1329
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,463
- I still got them papers.

1330
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,863
We can go get them if you want me to.

1331
01:05:44,863 --> 01:05:46,303
- It's okay just lay down.

1332
01:05:59,906 --> 01:06:00,739
- Wanda.

1333
01:06:04,362 --> 01:06:06,810
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1334
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:08,851
Gina and I will be leaving in the morning.

1335
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:09,684
- Oh.

1336
01:06:13,584 --> 01:06:17,260
- I'm sorry I put you through all this.

1337
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,870
Jimmy White and that buyer
aren't too happy with me either.

1338
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:25,120
I guess, I just wasted everybody's time.

1339
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,620
- Well, I wouldn't call
it a waste of time, Sarah.

1340
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,410
I mean maybe you didn't notice

1341
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:35,050
but, for the first time your daughter

1342
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:36,600
has opened up to someone.

1343
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,913
Gina just loves Mrs. Cooper.

1344
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,143
Do you know why?

1345
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,110
Because Mrs. Cooper is the only person

1346
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,500
that will take the time to talk with her

1347
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,473
and share with her.

1348
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:57,612
You daughter needs you, Sarah.

1349
01:06:57,612 --> 01:06:59,400
- Yeah, I know.

1350
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,700
I have missed out on a lot
these last few years, haven't I?

1351
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,360
I meant to come home for mother.

1352
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:12,520
I really did.

1353
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,720
- Well, you should have.

1354
01:07:16,584 --> 01:07:17,434
Goodnight, Sarah.

1355
01:07:18,336 --> 01:07:20,113
- I couldn't.

1356
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:25,400
I couldn't because mother was right.

1357
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,850
- What are you talking about?

1358
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,180
She hated everything about my life

1359
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:33,607
when I left here, my career, my husband.

1360
01:07:33,607 --> 01:07:37,480
- She was afraid that Jerry
would take you away from her.

1361
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,963
She didn't hate him.

1362
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,510
- He's in terrible trouble.

1363
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,730
When mother was dying,

1364
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,393
Jerry was indicted on fraud charges.

1365
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,770
- Indicted.

1366
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:54,013
- Now he's in jail.

1367
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,690
One of his investors found evidence

1368
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,750
that he may have embezzled some money

1369
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,300
from one of his real estate
deals a few years back.

1370
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,450
I have spent every last nickel

1371
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,591
trying to keep him out of jail.

1372
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:12,773
Now I can't even raise
money for bail. (sobbing)

1373
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,050
That's why I wanted to
sell the pecan grove.

1374
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:20,724
- Sarah, I had no idea.

1375
01:08:20,724 --> 01:08:22,220
- I wanted to help mother.

1376
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,823
I wanted to send money.

1377
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:29,203
But everything we own is in
the process of being repossess.

1378
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,240
I'm so scared, Wanda.

1379
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,140
I don't know what to do.

1380
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,789
- Why didn't you say something?

1381
01:08:35,789 --> 01:08:37,860
(Sarah sighs)

1382
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,360
- I was too proud.

1383
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:45,420
I know that sounds stupid.

1384
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:49,409
It sounds so silly now.

1385
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,090
The worse part is how

1386
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:57,323
I let you down.

1387
01:09:00,755 --> 01:09:03,422
(gentle music)

1388
01:09:17,851 --> 01:09:20,268
(door thuds)

1389
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:39,892
(birds chirping)

1390
01:09:39,892 --> 01:09:42,876
(rooster crowing in distance)

1391
01:09:42,876 --> 01:09:43,709
Gina.

1392
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,213
I told you, you can stay.

1393
01:09:49,963 --> 01:09:51,650
Your father's hearing
doesn't start for two weeks,

1394
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,443
and Wanda said you could stay
with her till school starts.

1395
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:57,470
You can be with Mrs. Cooper.

1396
01:09:59,639 --> 01:10:01,240
- You could've told me.

1397
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,953
Did you think I couldn't handle it?

1398
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:23,920
(telephone ringing)

1399
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,837
- [Wanda] We're not home right now.

1400
01:10:24,837 --> 01:10:26,403
But please leave a message.

1401
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,860
- [Henry] This is Henry Cooper Junior.

1402
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:33,370
I got a message that
you were looking for me

1403
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:34,770
regarding my mother.

1404
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:37,667
I apologize for not
getting back to you sooner.

1405
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:38,500
- Gina.
- But, I've been

1406
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,300
working out on the river.

1407
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,200
So I'm home now.

1408
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,267
I should be home the next few days.

1409
01:10:44,267 --> 01:10:45,710
- Don't hang up!

1410
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:46,543
- Hello.

1411
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:47,376
Hello.

1412
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,810
- [Sarah] Yeah, hello
this is Sarah Weatherby.

1413
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,330
- Who?

1414
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,163
- I'm Wanda's sister.

1415
01:10:53,163 --> 01:10:55,430
Oh, god, this is gonna sound crazy,

1416
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:58,530
but my sister and my daughter
have been looking for you.

1417
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:00,230
They think they found your mother.

1418
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:02,953
- They did.

1419
01:11:02,953 --> 01:11:05,170
- [Sarah] Lily Cooper from
Alabama, is that right?

1420
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,950
- Yeah.
- And, she started

1421
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:09,280
telling us all about you

1422
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,610
and how she's been looking for you.

1423
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,350
But she didn't know where to find you.

1424
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:15,515
- Well, I figured she was insane

1425
01:11:15,515 --> 01:11:16,585
(dramatic music)

1426
01:11:16,585 --> 01:11:19,560
or dead I didn't know which.

1427
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,910
- Oh, no, no, no, she's not crazy.

1428
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,250
She's just a very sweet woman,

1429
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,865
and you're all she talks about.

1430
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:29,310
She desperately would like to see you.

1431
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:31,750
You just mean everything to her really.

1432
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,370
- You kidding me, right?

1433
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:35,256
- No, she needs you.

1434
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:40,256
- Then she should have
stuck around for me.

1435
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:42,800
- She couldn't find you.

1436
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,940
The sheriff took you away from her.

1437
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:46,773
She just--

1438
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:47,606
- Ma'am.

1439
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:52,170
Ma'am, I appreciate the call.

1440
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,003
But...

1441
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,310
Thanks.

1442
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,143
Thanks anyway.

1443
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:02,276
(somber music)

1444
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,060
(sighs sharply)

1445
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:06,980
- Who was that?

1446
01:12:09,418 --> 01:12:13,873
- Some woman from South Carolina.

1447
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,640
She says they found my mother.

1448
01:12:22,882 --> 01:12:25,835
(people chattering)

1449
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:29,100
(telephone rings in distance)

1450
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,810
- Irma, where's Mrs.
Cooper did they move her?

1451
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:35,253
- Yeah, they took her
upstairs to CCU last night.

1452
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:38,990
- To coronary.
- Yeah.

1453
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:41,080
- Any idea how long her blood pressure's

1454
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,100
gone untreated like this?

1455
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,740
- Oh, well, forever I guess.

1456
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,343
What's wrong?

1457
01:12:45,343 --> 01:12:47,140
- Well, her confusions caused by

1458
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:49,530
hardening of the arteries in the brain.

1459
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:50,363
Her heart's so weak,

1460
01:12:50,363 --> 01:12:53,320
we'll be lucky if she
responds to medication.

1461
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,927
- If she responds?

1462
01:12:55,824 --> 01:12:57,997
- Well, do the best we
can, Wanda, all right?

1463
01:12:57,997 --> 01:12:59,080
- Yeah, okay.

1464
01:13:03,114 --> 01:13:04,200
(Wanda sighs)

1465
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,990
- (sighs) If only her son would come.

1466
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:07,233
Maybe he could help her.

1467
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,530
- Yeah, but we knew he
might not sweetheart

1468
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:12,330
and we have to respect his decision.

1469
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:16,623
- Can we at least tell Mrs.
Cooper that he's still alive?

1470
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,783
Maybe that'll help her just to know.

1471
01:13:19,783 --> 01:13:21,540
- I think it would just break her heart

1472
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,830
if she couldn't see him.

1473
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,223
She's sad enough not
being in the pecan grove.

1474
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,233
- She's right honey.

1475
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,993
Look maybe we should stop and
see her on the way to Atlanta.

1476
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,340
Could you give us a call
if anything happens?

1477
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:39,200
You know we could always
drive back if we have to.

1478
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,033
- All right.

1479
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,507
- Bye, Aunt Wanda.
- Bye, Gina.

1480
01:13:45,507 --> 01:13:46,602
(people chattering)

1481
01:13:46,602 --> 01:13:49,435
(elevator chimes)

1482
01:13:50,683 --> 01:13:52,500
(telephone rings in distance)

1483
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,170
- Gina, would you mind if I,

1484
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:57,110
had a moment with Mrs. Cooper by myself?

1485
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:58,010
- No, go ahead.

1486
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,187
Go ahead.

1487
01:13:59,187 --> 01:14:00,020
- Thanks.

1488
01:14:05,726 --> 01:14:08,559
(machine beeping)

1489
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:14,918
(dramatic music)

1490
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:21,573
Mrs. Cooper.

1491
01:14:37,023 --> 01:14:39,660
I just wanna say I'm sorry

1492
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:40,723
for the way I acted.

1493
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,543
I didn't mean anything against you.

1494
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,064
- I know sweetheart.

1495
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,440
You was fighting yourself not me.

1496
01:14:54,047 --> 01:14:56,215
Did they find him?

1497
01:14:56,215 --> 01:14:58,132
Did they find my Henry?

1498
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,887
- No, not yet.

1499
01:15:04,387 --> 01:15:06,100
But he's okay.

1500
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:06,933
I know he is.

1501
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:14,377
- I was just too scared
to go back and get him.

1502
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:16,910
- Well, you couldn't.

1503
01:15:18,007 --> 01:15:19,157
That wasn't your fault.

1504
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:25,943
But I'm sure he would love you

1505
01:15:27,654 --> 01:15:29,821
if he could only know you.

1506
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:34,580
- It wasn't meant to be I guess.

1507
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:37,893
- You have loved him so much for so long.

1508
01:15:42,696 --> 01:15:44,363
You think he'd know.

1509
01:15:49,023 --> 01:15:50,370
It's too bad we can't

1510
01:15:51,509 --> 01:15:54,092
always feel the love around us.

1511
01:16:01,104 --> 01:16:03,351
- You're a good girl.

1512
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:05,101
You a real good girl.

1513
01:16:12,008 --> 01:16:14,758
(dramatic music)

1514
01:16:26,825 --> 01:16:27,860
- Gina.

1515
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,459
Gina, come on, let's go.

1516
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:30,400
- What happened?

1517
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,801
- We got some business to take care of.

1518
01:16:31,801 --> 01:16:32,634
Come on.

1519
01:16:36,308 --> 01:16:39,141
(birds chirping)

1520
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:42,579
(dog barking)

1521
01:16:52,864 --> 01:16:54,440
- Hi.

1522
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,273
- How you doing?

1523
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,608
Can we help you?

1524
01:17:03,608 --> 01:17:05,070
- I hope so.

1525
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:07,090
We're the ones who
called about your mother.

1526
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,190
My name's Sarah Weatherby,

1527
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,693
and this is my daughter Gina.

1528
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,150
- I mean I knew my dad,

1529
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:17,290
and the sheriff had some
shady stuff going on.

1530
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:22,290
But, I never know what
had become of my mama.

1531
01:17:22,313 --> 01:17:24,993
- You got the same eyes
and the same smile.

1532
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:29,383
All these cats there's so
much you have in common.

1533
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:34,085
- I'm sorry.

1534
01:17:34,085 --> 01:17:36,380
I just can't.

1535
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:38,963
- (sighs) She adores you Henry.

1536
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,350
Why don't you come up and see her?

1537
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:46,460
- I'm glad to know she's doing all right.

1538
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:51,460
But I spent so many years
trying to forget about her.

1539
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:54,690
I don't know if I could
make room for her now.

1540
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,033
- But she needs you,
Henry, really she does.

1541
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,221
You could ride up with us.

1542
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:03,320
- Do you know what it's like

1543
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:06,660
growing up feeling like
your mama doesn't love you?

1544
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,560
That she's abandoned you.

1545
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,870
I can remember as a little
boy just hoping every day

1546
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:13,483
that my mama would come and find me.

1547
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,447
Then after a while you start to think,

1548
01:18:16,447 --> 01:18:18,107
"Well, what is wrong with me?

1549
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:20,717
"I mean what did I do so terrible?

1550
01:18:20,717 --> 01:18:23,750
"My own mama won't try and find me."

1551
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,100
- She did.

1552
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,750
She wrote you a letter every day

1553
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,950
after that sheriff put
her in that hospital.

1554
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:32,660
She saved everything she had
so she could send for you.

1555
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,380
She was afraid to go back.

1556
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,030
That's why she couldn't find you.

1557
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,010
Please come, Mr. Copper.

1558
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,823
- She really loves you, Henry.

1559
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,350
Don't miss a chance to let her know

1560
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:45,893
how much you love her too.

1561
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:52,650
- No, kidding.

1562
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:54,650
- Yeah, you should've seen her.

1563
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,040
She talked him into it.

1564
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,520
Mother talked him into it.

1565
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,413
Aunt Wanda he's got
cats all over the place.

1566
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:05,070
Tell, Mrs. Cooper we're
gonna be there okay.

1567
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,203
- Gina, wait.

1568
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,053
Listen.

1569
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:11,340
(Wanda sighs)

1570
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,470
I've been trying to call you.

1571
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:14,780
You know, she's not doing too well.

1572
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,190
- [Sarah] It's really too hot for coffee.

1573
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:17,840
Don't you think?
- What?

1574
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,400
- Mrs. Cooper she just might
not make it till tomorrow.

1575
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,700
- No.

1576
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,390
Wanda, you gotta tell her.

1577
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:25,590
You gotta make her wait.

1578
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,250
Tell her that Field Pea asked her too.

1579
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,780
- I'm gonna try, sweetheart.

1580
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:33,300
But listen you better just
get here as fast as you can.

1581
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,468
All right we'll see you soon.

1582
01:19:35,468 --> 01:19:38,635
(fax machine buzzing)

1583
01:19:49,277 --> 01:19:52,277
(people chattering)

1584
01:19:55,781 --> 01:19:58,448
(machine beeps)

1585
01:19:59,926 --> 01:20:00,759
Hey, Irma.

1586
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,780
Mrs. Cooper.

1587
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:05,620
- Hmm?

1588
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:06,487
- Mrs. Cooper.

1589
01:20:06,487 --> 01:20:07,404
- Mm.
- Hey.

1590
01:20:08,733 --> 01:20:10,247
I have some good news for you.

1591
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:12,500
- Hmm?

1592
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:16,560
(gentle music)

1593
01:20:22,267 --> 01:20:23,600
- That is Henry?

1594
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:25,693
- Uh-huh.

1595
01:20:26,684 --> 01:20:29,111
- You found my Henry.

1596
01:20:29,111 --> 01:20:31,778
(gentle music)

1597
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:34,930
- He's coming to see you.

1598
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,407
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

1599
01:20:39,644 --> 01:20:41,577
- Look at my baby.

1600
01:20:41,577 --> 01:20:43,547
- (laughs) Yes.

1601
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,714
- All my life.

1602
01:20:47,382 --> 01:20:49,486
My baby's all right.

1603
01:20:49,486 --> 01:20:50,486
Look at him.

1604
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:56,742
Thank you.

1605
01:20:57,985 --> 01:20:58,818
Thank you.

1606
01:21:10,682 --> 01:21:13,349
(gentle music)

1607
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,723
To my darling Henry,

1608
01:21:41,524 --> 01:21:44,337
I don't know if I'll still be here

1609
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,103
when you come to see me.

1610
01:21:52,684 --> 01:21:55,517
(birds chirping)

1611
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,760
- Wanda.

1612
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:03,980
Sorry.

1613
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,130
- What's, what's happening.

1614
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:06,920
- She started having chest
pains during the night,

1615
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,610
so we're taking her for an angiogram.

1616
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:11,180
It's possible she may
need an emergency bypass.

1617
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:13,200
- And what are her chances?

1618
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,030
- We could lose her.
- No, Bill you can't.

1619
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,038
- The heart teams ready,
Wanda, we gotta move.

1620
01:22:17,038 --> 01:22:18,553
- Can I just go see her?

1621
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:21,027
- For a minute.
- Thank you.

1622
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:28,170
- Move your hand for me, dear.

1623
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,830
Let me take that okay.

1624
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:30,663
- Irma.

1625
01:22:30,663 --> 01:22:31,725
Irma, let her keep it.

1626
01:22:31,725 --> 01:22:33,360
It's all right.

1627
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,210
Hey, Mrs. Cooper.

1628
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,370
Now listen Henry's coming.

1629
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:37,965
You wanna see him don't you?

1630
01:22:37,965 --> 01:22:39,632
- Mm-mm.
- All right.

1631
01:22:42,228 --> 01:22:44,594
- That little bitty baby

1632
01:22:44,594 --> 01:22:46,594
made this great big man.

1633
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:51,433
I ain't going nowhere, baby.

1634
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:53,327
- Listen we gotta get her ready.

1635
01:22:53,327 --> 01:22:54,160
- Okay.

1636
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,327
See you later.

1637
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,611
Billy, can't you wait a little longer?

1638
01:23:01,611 --> 01:23:04,306
- We need to get her started, Wanda.

1639
01:23:04,306 --> 01:23:08,306
(people chattering in distance)

1640
01:23:16,082 --> 01:23:16,915
- Wanda.

1641
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:19,285
Wanda.

1642
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:24,235
He's here.

1643
01:23:24,235 --> 01:23:25,970
(dramatic music)

1644
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:28,887
- Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1645
01:23:31,255 --> 01:23:32,118
He's here.

1646
01:23:32,118 --> 01:23:33,908
Mrs. Cooper, your son is here.

1647
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:34,868
- Henry.
- Mm-hmm.

1648
01:23:34,868 --> 01:23:36,148
Henry.

1649
01:23:36,148 --> 01:23:36,981
Henry.

1650
01:23:38,009 --> 01:23:40,433
Oh, praise the Lord.

1651
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:41,312
Henry.

1652
01:23:41,312 --> 01:23:42,368
Henry.
- Hey, mama.

1653
01:23:42,368 --> 01:23:44,180
- Henry.
- Hey, mama.

1654
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:45,632
- Henry.
- Hey mama.

1655
01:23:45,632 --> 01:23:48,299
(heavy sobbing)

1656
01:23:50,787 --> 01:23:52,548
- Did he take care of you?

1657
01:23:52,548 --> 01:23:54,364
- Yes, ma'am he sure did?

1658
01:23:54,364 --> 01:23:56,132
- Did he feed you right?

1659
01:23:56,132 --> 01:23:57,620
(heavy sobbing)

1660
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,252
(bright music)

1661
01:23:59,252 --> 01:24:02,335
They got you working on the boat now.

1662
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:06,046
You know how to swim, don't you?

1663
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,542
- Yeah, mama, I can swim I can swim.

1664
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:09,494
- That's good.

1665
01:24:09,494 --> 01:24:10,780
That's good.

1666
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:11,780
That's good.

1667
01:24:14,198 --> 01:24:15,660
That's good.

1668
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,872
That's good.

1669
01:24:16,872 --> 01:24:17,872
That's good.

1670
01:24:19,423 --> 01:24:20,970
- We gotta take her now, sir.

1671
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:23,303
- I better let you go, mama.

1672
01:24:25,081 --> 01:24:29,074
I'll talk you in a little while you hear.

1673
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:30,875
I missed you, mama.

1674
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:32,635
(tender music)

1675
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:34,131
I missed you.

1676
01:24:34,131 --> 01:24:36,798
(heavy sobbing)

1677
01:24:43,937 --> 01:24:45,281
- [Lilly] That's my baby.

1678
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,218
That's my baby.

1679
01:24:47,218 --> 01:24:48,468
That's my baby.

1680
01:24:51,344 --> 01:24:52,743
That's my baby.

1681
01:24:52,743 --> 01:24:54,096
That's my baby.

1682
01:24:54,096 --> 01:24:55,346
That's my baby.

1683
01:24:58,121 --> 01:24:59,986
(door creaks)

1684
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:03,986
(people chattering in distance)

1685
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:11,022
(door creaks)

1686
01:25:19,727 --> 01:25:21,665
- Wanda, I'm sorry.

1687
01:25:21,665 --> 01:25:23,415
She couldn't hang on.

1688
01:25:24,272 --> 01:25:25,855
- No, no she can't.

1689
01:25:27,134 --> 01:25:29,967
(dramatic music)

1690
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:37,934
- I'm very sorry.

1691
01:25:37,934 --> 01:25:40,684
(dramatic music)

1692
01:25:42,725 --> 01:25:45,392
(heavy sobbing)

1693
01:25:59,872 --> 01:26:01,271
(insects chittering)

1694
01:26:01,271 --> 01:26:03,462
(birds chirping)

1695
01:26:03,462 --> 01:26:06,045
(somber music)

1696
01:26:12,047 --> 01:26:15,454
- Should've known y'all would be with her.

1697
01:26:15,454 --> 01:26:18,037
(gentle music)

1698
01:26:22,673 --> 01:26:25,173
(cats mewing)

1699
01:26:31,954 --> 01:26:32,787
- Gina.

1700
01:26:37,785 --> 01:26:40,035
- Why couldn't she wait
just a little longer?

1701
01:26:41,569 --> 01:26:42,569
- Oh, honey.

1702
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,943
She waited almost 50 years.

1703
01:26:52,793 --> 01:26:57,626
I wish I could've been a good
friend to her like you were.

1704
01:27:00,417 --> 01:27:03,130
You cared about her
when no one else would.

1705
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:07,123
You believed in her.

1706
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,540
You know, wherever she is,

1707
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,743
she's never gonna forget that ever.

1708
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,563
We thought we were
hearing about her story.

1709
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,163
She was really talking
about all of us too.

1710
01:27:29,235 --> 01:27:31,902
(gentle music)

1711
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:37,373
Things will be pretty
tough for a while, honey.

1712
01:27:40,323 --> 01:27:42,323
I'm gone need your help.

1713
01:27:43,537 --> 01:27:45,287
- We can do it, mama.

1714
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:48,425
(tender music)

1715
01:27:48,425 --> 01:27:51,008
(bird squawks)

1716
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:52,934
- Oh, baby.

1717
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:03,060
- While I couldn't hold you or touch you

1718
01:28:03,959 --> 01:28:06,163
or lift your spirits with a smile,

1719
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,450
I can only hope that you will someday

1720
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,273
know how much I have loved you.

1721
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:17,483
With all my love your mother,

1722
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:19,893
Lilly Cooper.

1723
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:24,890
So, they were all for me, huh?

1724
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:26,140
- Every last one of them.

1725
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:28,650
- I can't thank you all enough

1726
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,050
for what you've done for me.

1727
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,800
You've given me something that,

1728
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,300
I never thought that I'd have.

1729
01:28:37,149 --> 01:28:39,490
(Henry sighs)

1730
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:42,340
I wouldn't dream of taking
this place away from you all.

1731
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:43,590
It's part of your family,

1732
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,840
and I want the both of you to have it.

1733
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,090
- Henry, are you sure?

1734
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,450
- Yes.

1735
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,563
- Thank you.

1736
01:28:51,563 --> 01:28:52,563
- Thank you.

1737
01:28:53,714 --> 01:28:56,214
(Wanda sighs)

1738
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,900
- We gone go for the last shot, huh?

1739
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,850
- Actually, I want you to have this.

1740
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:04,370
- [Henry] I couldn't do that.

1741
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:06,179
- [Gina] Maybe you'll get to know her now.

1742
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:07,760
(gentle music)

1743
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,593
- Thank you.

1744
01:29:09,818 --> 01:29:11,151
I appreciate it.

1745
01:29:12,587 --> 01:29:15,594
- Henry, don't wanna miss that plane.

1746
01:29:15,594 --> 01:29:16,427
- Okay.

1747
01:29:17,513 --> 01:29:20,040
- Henry, I hope we see you
and Evelyn again sometime.

1748
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,630
Maybe Thanksgiving.

1749
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:22,727
- We'd like that.
- All right.

1750
01:29:22,727 --> 01:29:24,278
- [Henry] We'd like that very much.

1751
01:29:24,278 --> 01:29:25,257
- Fly safely now, okay?

1752
01:29:25,257 --> 01:29:26,712
- Okay.

1753
01:29:26,712 --> 01:29:27,695
Thanks.

1754
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:30,528
(dramatic music)

1755
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,802
(pensive music)

1756
01:29:52,881 --> 01:29:54,298
- I have an idea.

1757
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,860
Now that it's ours again,

1758
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:59,333
why don't we get the place running.

1759
01:30:01,514 --> 01:30:03,001
- What are you kidding me?

1760
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:04,837
- No, really.

1761
01:30:04,837 --> 01:30:06,360
Clean out this part over here

1762
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,103
and put in some storage sheds.

1763
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,100
Use this area over here
for shelling of the pecans,

1764
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:16,835
and we'll use the money we
make to fix up the place.

1765
01:30:16,835 --> 01:30:18,568
(Wanda laughs)

1766
01:30:18,568 --> 01:30:19,990
What do you think?

1767
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:21,510
- Would mother would be surprised at you.

1768
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:22,726
- Oh, I know.

1769
01:30:22,726 --> 01:30:24,024
Papa too.

1770
01:30:24,024 --> 01:30:26,607
(bright music)

1771
01:30:52,796 --> 01:30:55,546
(birds chirping)

1772
01:31:02,346 --> 01:31:04,929
(gentle music)

1773
01:31:49,415 --> 01:31:52,082
(bright music)
