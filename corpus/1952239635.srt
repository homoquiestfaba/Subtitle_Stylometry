1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,232
Rock music

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,391
103-11 Mash.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,596
Oh, I don't drink alcohol.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,151
Neither do I. It's not alcohol.
It's H2-O mixed with soil from deep in the Earth.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,550
It's a health drink.
It fortifies you and cleans you out

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,675
all at the same time.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,515
Here's your Mash.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,196
- Mmmm!
- Ah!

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,315
Whooo!

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,868
Whoo. Really mild, huh?

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,117
Here's mud in your eye.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,193
Urgh!

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,279
- What's wrong?
- Check out the guy at the bar.

14
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,316
- What about him?
- He's a Betrayer.

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,391
How do you know?

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,789
Bailies took him from my village

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,270
when I was six. He should be 50 by now.
He hasn't changed a bit.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,920
Hel, don't let her do anything rash.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,869
I don't want her terminating somebody
because they aged well.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,679
Hey, ladies, can I buy you some drinks?

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,035
Maybe we can have some fun.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,348
Yeah.

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,396
- We can have some fun.

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,475
Sarge, no!

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,279
- Is he human or robotic?
- I don't know, Sarge. Do robots bleed?

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,989
Stay down!

27
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,471
Get out of there!

28
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,114
Go! I'm right behind you!

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,156
Hey. wait for me!
- Shields up!

30
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,555
Hel!

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,868
Watch out!

32
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,310
Let's finish him!

33
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,036
Hel, are you all right?

34
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,348
Yeah.

35
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,910
But there's a new generation of Betrayers
that's harder to destroy.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,595
You have to learn how the Betrayers are made
if we're going to beat them.

37
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,638
What do we do?
Walk into the local Betrayer factory?

38
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,757
That's exactly what we'll do.
It means hitting the surface.

39
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,796
Were you not just here?

40
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,360
500 years into the future, she will enter a world
where machines rule the Earth.

41
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,718
Mankind has been driven underground.

42
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,240
And Cleopatra is about to discover
there's no place like home.

43
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,632
ln the year 2525

44
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,837
There are women with the will to survive

45
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,037
Fighting for a brand-new day

46
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,830
Nothing's gonna get in their way

47
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,992
And in the year 2525

48
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,197
Three women keep hope alive

49
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,397
Joining forces to reclaim the Earth

50
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,794
Looking ahead to humankind's rebirth

51
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,035
Wow!

52
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,992
Mmm, fresh air!

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,116
Oh, God, it's awesome!

54
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,236
Get over here!

55
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,951
Sorry. Living in a hole in the ground
makes a girl appreciate a little sunshine.

56
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,396
- It's over here, guys.
- Awesome? What kind of word is that?

57
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,597
But I thought the Bailies
drove everyone underground.

58
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,069
No, the Bailies allow these Dworks to live here.

59
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,151
Sarge thinks they're models for Betrayers.

60
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,358
The Dworks think the Bailies are
friendly aliens that take select folk

61
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,193
- to their planet.
- She'll mark the next one to be taken.

62
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,477
Then we're going to track the Bailey
to the Betrayer factory.

63
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,028
She's a fast learner.
- She can be.

64
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,031
What was that? Was that The Voice?

65
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,111
Did she say something about me? What?

66
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,156
See that one in the purple get-up?

67
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,709
- She's the next one to be taken.
- Hmm.

68
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,149
Nice work.

69
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,754
She's coming in nice and clear.

70
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,796
We'll be able to track her easy.

71
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,836
I'm gonna get you!

72
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,394
- What's wrong, Sarge?
- That's my sister.

73
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,438
Your sister?

74
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,318
- You were a Dwork?
- Sh!

75
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,675
Listen.

76
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,513
- There.

77
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,038
Wow.

78
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,076
What are they?

79
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,718
We gotta go get her.

80
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,393
- You won't let them take her?
- So we just scrap our mission?

81
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,436
She's your family.

82
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,996
Go. I'll cover you.

83
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,400
What are you doing?

84
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,991
Shields up!

85
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,109
Come on! Run!

86
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,189
Run where?

87
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,598
Aaargh!

88
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,669
Sarge. Wait.

89
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,716
Hold up here.

90
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,837
Our cloaking devices should confuse it.

91
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,956
Hopefully, it'll move on.

92
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,075
Rose?

93
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,550
Rose?

94
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,518
Yeah, and she's Lily.
They named us all after flowers.

95
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,156
That's cute.

96
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,958
Voice, we have a complication.

97
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,918
Sisters reuniting.

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,958
Isn't this beautiful?

99
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,916
Aren't you two going to hug?

100
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,396
Come on.

101
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,596
How about a handshake?

102
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,638
If Cleopatra can pull off her part, this will work.

103
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,676
All right. Tryit.

104
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,309
Butifsomething goes wrong,
I want you to abort immediately.

105
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,876
Clear.

106
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,273
You erm...understand the plan, right?

107
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,511
Oh, sure, I was totally into that stuff in the 21 st...

108
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,676
You still haven't explained anything.

109
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
Where have you been?
Why did you attack the emissary?

110
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,950
Beam us up, Scotty. Then get it fixed.

111
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,156
The transporter's still down.

112
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,357
- We can't return to the starship.
- What do you mean, starship?

113
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,874
Your sister isn't real sharp, is she?

114
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,909
Travelling between Earth and the mother planet
is hard without a starship. Even for your sister.

115
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,197
LILY: You've been to the mother planet, Rose?
- Where do you think

116
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,875
Rose has been for ten years?
Crawling around underground like a worm?

117
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,188
She is on a mission.

118
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,589
That's why
she was trying to signal the emissary.

119
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,237
You were trying to get their attention?

120
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,879
Yeah.

121
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,714
Yes. This is why she must be
the next one that the Bailies take.

122
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,951
It is of the utmost importance, Lily,
for Rose to return

123
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,679
to the mother planet as soon as possible.

124
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,118
Lily, your sister has had
a close encounter of the fourth kind,

125
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,431
and must continue her quest to solve the X-Files.

126
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,080
- Oh, yes.
- The X-Files?

127
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,756
The truth is out there, Lily.

128
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,193
Scary how she comes up with that stuff, huh?

129
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,236
Yeah, she lies real well.

130
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,598
Of course, that surface scum will believe
just about anything they're told.

131
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,196
Sarge, what have you got?

132
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,077
Look out!

133
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,912
Shields up!

134
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,589
Help! My shield's gone.

135
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,159
I know.

136
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,556
Hel! Behind you!

137
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,155
Hel!

138
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,835
Sarge!

139
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,669
Look out!

140
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,748
Nice shot.

141
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,958
- Mauser's gonna love those.
- What were those things?

142
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,598
Some new Bailey probe.

143
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,797
- Stay alert.
- OK.

144
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,713
Come on.

145
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,314
Hel's going for the factory.
You know the plan, Cleo?

146
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,473
No problem. I just have to convince these guys
that the emissaries have to take you next.

147
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,316
Live long and prosper.

148
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,632
May the Force be with you.

149
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,669
Commander Cleopatra's
explaining your mission to the elders.

150
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,398
-You're welcome home, Rose.
- Will I be the next one taken?

151
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,472
They haven't decided yet
but I'm sure the answer will be yes.

152
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,516
The Commander's so convincing.

153
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,436
Hey, I missed you.

154
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,954
Hel, are you sleeping?

155
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,996
Oh, no.

156
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,469
I'm more awake now than I've ever been.

157
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,516
The night sky...

158
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,672
- I've never seen it before.
- Beautiful, isn't it?

159
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,036
- Awesome.
- Awesome? Sounds like Cleopatra

160
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,634
has been rubbing off on you.

161
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,676
So this is what we're fighting for?

162
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,716
This is where we belong, Hel.

163
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,518
- So, tell me about Mother and Father
- What?

164
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,433
Mother and Father. You must have seen them
on the mother planet.

165
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,911
- The Bailies took them years ago.
- Yes, and they're doing very well.

166
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,754
Your mother is the head
of the Space Odyssey Research Team

167
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,798
and your father is an instructor

168
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,155
- at the Battlestar Galactica.
- Oh, wow!

169
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,595
Rose, you must be so proud.

170
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,319
Listen to me, Lily. Nothing here is what it seems.

171
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,356
I haven't been to the mother planet,

172
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,431
Cleo is no Commander

173
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,431
and Mom and Dad are not waiting anywhere.

174
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,115
How do you know
if you haven't even been there?

175
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,636
Come on, Lily, don't buy into this crap
they've been feeding you.

176
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,076
It's all lies. Come on,
you have to try to think for yourself.

177
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,749
Are you listening to me?
Don't you let those emissaries take you!

178
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,717
Rose

179
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,236
Stop teasing her.

180
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,436
Yeah.

181
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,476
That's right.

182
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,313
Just teasing.

183
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,036
It's OK, it's OK.

184
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,919
Attagirl, Sarge.

185
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,594
Oh, yeah.

186
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,636
She's gonna lead us to Betrayer Central.

187
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,676
Oh, that's original!

188
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,595
Stop!

189
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,189
She's not from the mother planet.
She's from the underground.

190
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,395
Lily!

191
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,471
Please!

192
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,755
Take me! I'm the one that's supposed to go.

193
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,910
- Look!
- What are you doing?

194
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,513
She's the one that attacked you this morning.

195
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,515
- What are you doing?
- Damn!

196
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,192
What is it?
- It ain't good.

197
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,039
I'm the one that's supposed to go.
I'm the chosen one.

198
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,235
Please. Please, take me.

199
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,675
Plea...

200
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,835
Aaaargh! Lily!

201
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,112
Lily!

202
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,594
- Are you OK?
- Uh-huh.

203
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,760
- Take me! Please!
- No!

204
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,755
Cleo! Just leave her!

205
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,274
I'm the one that's supposed to go!

206
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,316
Damn.

207
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,035
What's your plan, Hel?
- Sarge gave Lily a dose of tracking fluid.

208
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,759
I'm getting a slight reading. We can track her.

209
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,308
Sarge, I know you blame Lily for losing Cleo.

210
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,439
- Any reason why I shouldn't?
- No. You're angry with your sister. Fine.

211
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,069
I'm not pleased with her either.
But we're walking into bad guys' territory

212
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,789
and I cannot afford to have you distracted
by some family squabble.

213
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,996
You don't have to worry about me.

214
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,036
Good.

215
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,076
We'll take out Lily first thing.

216
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,630
When she's down, we'll grab Cleo
and bug out. No problem.

217
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,996
Problem.

218
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,477
Aaaargh!

219
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,678
Aaaaaargh!

220
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,149
This must be Roswell.

221
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,118
Where they prepare to take us
to the mother planet.

222
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,431
I've anointed myself in the prescribed manner!

223
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,149
Lily! Lily! Sh! Listen up, space cadet.

224
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,993
There is no mother planet. That was just a line.

225
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,752
Oh, really?

226
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,752
Like your close encounter with Mr Spock?

227
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,118
Was that a line too? A joke you delivered
to your friends to mock our beliefs?

228
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,194
OK, I do believe in aliens. All right?
But they're not all cute and cuddly.

229
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,432
Some come bursting out of your tummy
or give you the Vulcan death grip.

230
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,476
There is no Vulcan death grip.

231
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,630
And you don't belong here.

232
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,196
Duh!

233
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,315
Damn! I lost the signal.
The tracking fluid must have worn off.

234
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,233
- There's only one alternative.
Not the Drones.

235
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,232
- I can't allow that.
- Come on.

236
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,950
I could use a little help here.

237
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,238
Why would I want to escape? I was chosen
to make the journey to the mother planet.

238
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,959
If I don't get this door open,
nobody's going anywhere.

239
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,677
Damn!

240
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,038
Your sister could probably open that
with a paperclip and a piece of string.

241
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,396
Well, why don't you wait for her?
She'll probably turn up.

242
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,756
She seems to enjoy disrupting
the rites of the ascension.

243
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,796
They have a war to fight.

244
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,758
I don't think they have time
to come looking for me.

245
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,155
Hel. you can't let Sarge
fire that up there.

246
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,676
- It's that or we come home without Cleopatra.
- Not an option.

247
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,116
The last team that used that thing was wiped out.
No survivors.

248
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,591
So we just do nothing while they turn our friend
into a Betrayer? There's a plan! Ready?

249
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,717
- Locked and loaded.
- I'll launch the Drone. Go back to the lab.

250
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,076
- No sense in both of us getting killed.
- I know what you're doing.

251
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,628
- What?
- You think if you keep me from seeing Lily,

252
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,438
I'll cool off, right?

253
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,229
Well, it wouldn't be the first time
I've had to sit on you

254
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,314
- to keep you from doing something crazy
- Unless you can take this off me, I've work to do.

255
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,789
All right.

256
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,475
It is time.

257
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,994
- I'm ready.
- No! Lily!

258
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,469
Remember Rose said never let them take you.

259
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,348
- Rose is an unbeliever. She hides from the light.
- It is time.

260
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,556
We got it. What if your sister was right?

261
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,074
She's not my sister any more.

262
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,916
Scanning.

263
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,719
- And we've got company.

264
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,751
- Sarge!
- Yeah, I know.

265
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,317
- Come on!
- Just a minute.

266
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,798
Now.

267
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,438
- Got it!
- Cut the link.

268
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,115
It lost our signal.
It can't see through our shields.

269
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,918
It knows we're here.

270
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,271
COMPUTER: Your journey

271
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,316
is about to begin.

272
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,036
You will not be harmed.

273
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,628
Joy and enlightenment await you.

274
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,750
Do not be afraid.

275
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,389
I'm not afraid. I await joy and enlightenment
on the mother planet.

276
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,277
It's OK, guys.

277
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,351
It's cool, man. Oh, man, look...

278
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,637
I'm really not into needles... Argh!

279
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,633
I have been chosen by the elders
to complete the journey of truth...

280
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,631
Ow!

281
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,193
Cleopatra?

282
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,236
What are they doing?

283
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,834
It ain't joy and enlightenment, space cadet.

284
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,996
COMPUTER: Relax

285
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,279
Don't move. As long as Mauser's shields hold,

286
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,157
it can't find us.

287
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,316
OK, that's new.

288
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,712
Voice, we're in trouble.

289
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,275
Hel. I'll launch a Drone
to lure away the Bailey.

290
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,795
Looks like we just lost
our tactical edge on the ground.

291
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,711
We've still got a fix on the factory.

292
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,116
It's this way. 1,200 metres.

293
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,075
- What are they?
- Some kind of pod people.

294
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,879
What's going on?

295
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,559
This isn't the way it's supposed to be.

296
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,915
Why are they doing this?

297
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,231
They're draining our life forces
to power those things.

298
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,756
My sister was right.

299
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,637
Lily, we have to fight it.

300
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,756
- I can't.
- Lily!

301
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,070
Fight!

302
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,118
The voices...

303
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,315
- It's going to be fine...
This is a dream.

304
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,949
- Yes, Voice, I hear you.
- The Voice has saved us so many times.

305
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,110
The Voice.

306
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,159
- She knows about The Voice.
- She may be of even greater use to us.

307
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,596
There's the factory.

308
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,153
- I'll take point.
- I hope you know what you're doing.

309
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,629
- You mean about Lily?
- She's your sister.

310
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,393
She's my sister. She's also weak and stupid.

311
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,632
So our mission gets blown and Cleopatra
will maybe come back with guns on her arms.

312
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,711
All because of my stupid sister.

313
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,316
Do what you want to do. But I wouldn't
be able to live with myself afterwards.

314
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,118
You don't have to.

315
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,356
We could do serious damage
with these cloaking generators.

316
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,750
- Sure. When they're not in the shop. Voice?
- Yes Hel?

317
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,992
Tell Mauser to download Cleopatra's
biochem profile into the Drone launcher.

318
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,036
- Got a plan, Hel?
- Oh, yeah.

319
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,596
Lily...

320
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,836
Are you still with me, girl?

321
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,916
Lily. Lily!

322
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,550
This is not good.

323
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,553
The data's been uploaded, Hel.
- Launcher.

324
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,758
I've adjusted the Drone so it keys off
Cleopatra's pheromone signature.

325
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,515
- You're going to sniff her out?
- Go get her, boy.

326
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,913
- Talk to me, Sarge.
- Got her. Let's go.

327
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,070
I've had enough of you guys.

328
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,672
Uh... Hel!

329
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,119
Lily.

330
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,918
Aaaargh!

331
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,429
Help!

332
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,629
- Are you all right?
- I feel like

333
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,030
my brain's been sucked
into an unstoppable killing machine,

334
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,111
- and a little dry-mouthed.
- Come on.

335
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,754
Wake up!

336
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,635
- You came to save me?
- Shut up!

337
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,029
Sarge!

338
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,599
LILY: I'm sorry.

339
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,910
Everything you said was true.

340
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,594
I know I was wrong.

341
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,036
Please, Rose, I just wanted to be
with Mother and Father.

342
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,429
I didn't want to be alone. Please forgive me.

343
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,034
-
- I'm sorry.

344
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,476
Let's blow this place.

345
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,274
Get down! Go!

346
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,269
Go!

347
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,950
Damn! All these tunnels look the same. Oh, no.

348
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,871
- Come on!
- Get over here, now!

349
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,916
Voice, we're trapped.

350
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,833
And our delay grenades
are set to go off any second.

351
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,672
Shoot the floor!
- What?

352
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,797
- Shoot the floor!
- Voice says shoot the floor.

353
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,359
Can't hurt.

354
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,789
Come on.

355
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,636
Thanks.

356
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,995
I wasn't sure you'd be coming back for me.

357
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,116
We never leave a team member behind.

358
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,156
- I'm a team member?
- Sh!

359
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,800
What about Lily?

360
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,036
She can't go back to the surface.

361
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,076
The Bailies will come after her.

362
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,436
Well...

363
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,476
I guess you could come with us.

364
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,516
Er...

365
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,795
I don't know. It's kind of dark down here.

366
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,792
Oh, your eyes adjust after a while.

367
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,678
Look, Lily, it's not the surface.

368
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,228
But you've got a lot to learn down here and...

369
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,236
..well, I could teach you.

370
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,876
OK, show me.

371
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,036
Ready?

372
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,071
Whoo!

373
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,071
Next week: 107 Run Cleo Run
