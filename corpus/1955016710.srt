00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,255
Thank you. How you doing today, Jack?

4
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:06,559
What time is it?

5
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,994
It'll soon be 2:00. Yeah.

6
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,830
How about the day?

7
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,198
Excuse me?

8
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,332
What day is it?

9
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,701
It's the fourth!

10
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,603
Friday?

11
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:19,270
No, it's Tuesday.

12
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,137
All right.

13
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,341

23
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,418
How long have I been asleep?

24
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,952
I don't know how I would know that?

25
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:17,823
Makes sense.

26
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:20,092
So, how've you been?

27
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:22,928
Yeah.

28
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:35,239
That look good to you?

29
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:36,674
Yeah.

30
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:41,012
Hey, I heard through the grapevine
that, um, you used to work for Miller?

31
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,880
Okay.

32
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:44,315
Well, is that true?

33
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,918
No.

34
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,755
Well, um, I just wanted to tell you...

36
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:55,159
that my internship is gonna
be over in two weeks and...

37
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:56,462
I'll find another intern.

38
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,864
Where are you gonna find another intern?

39
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:02,835
Money... people like money.

40
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,137
Alrighty then, worked on me.

41
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:10,743
Oh yeah, I actually won't
be able to do Thursday.

42
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:15,113
So, maybe we can connect
tomorrow? You know, same time?

43
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:18,117
- Okay.
- Thanks.

44
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,887
You know, discreet's the way to go.

45
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,855
The whole reason why I can't do Friday...

46
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:27,859
is my sister has this big orientation
thing and you know, I gotta be...

47
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:34,065
Tomorrow!

48
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,170

Hi.

51
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,204
How was your meeting with Jeremy?

52
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:46,571
Fine.

53
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,807
Wow... great.

54
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:54,512
Oh, okay... okay.

55
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,124
So...

56
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:07,526
you and Jeremy meet often?

57
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:08,392
Sometimes.

58
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,996
Oh, yeah, well, we're looking for him...

59
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,497
so maybe you should join us for a ride.

60
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:13,565
I'm okay.

61
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:17,035
Oh, yeah, you know what?
That's not really an option.

62
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:24,275
- Don't.
- What?

63
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,081

Oh, my god, what happened to your hand?

75
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,330
And your eyes?

Why?

81
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,573
It was an accident.

82
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:06,278
My landlord thought I was
robbing my own apartment.

83
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,114
Really? Isn't your
landlord, like, 90 years old?

84
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:12,418
Yeah, but she's spry.

85
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:17,389
And then, uh, I fell on a glass.

86
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:21,426
Hm, can I get you some ice for that?

87
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,994
No, I'm fine.

88
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,364

89
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:26,630
Oatmeal.

90
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,199
- That's it?
- Yeah.

91
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:36,975
Do you have anything on the
agenda for later tonight?

92
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:45,317
Nothing... sleeping, so, no.

93
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:51,789
Um, something to drink?

94
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:53,025
Hot tea.

95
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:55,394

your place earlier today.</i>

108
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:29,693
I'm hanging up.

109
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:32,329

Gillian, I don't know
what you're talking about.

<i>Andrea.</i>

114
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,573
Repeating the name doesn't help.

115
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:48,313
<i>Andrea, you dumb fuck, she said
she saw you this afternoon.</i>

116
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,082
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

117
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:51,683
She was here.

118
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,319
<i>I know. But she's out drinking
now, because you said or did...</i>

119
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:57,289
<i>something that sent her
up the fucking wall.</i>

120
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,859
I opened the door and
she ran off. That's it.

121
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:02,326
<i>You fucked it up, Jack.</i>

122
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,829
I don't even know what I did.

123
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:05,262
<i>She just wanted to meet you.</i>

124
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:06,330
Why?

125
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,566

130
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:20,178

132
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:23,981

133
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:26,750

134
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:29,788

137
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,795

139
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:12,264

140
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:13,832
What does she look like?

141
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,366
A young lady with a lip ring.

142
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,235
You her dad?

143
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,403
She was here?

144
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:19,904
Yeah... you her dad?

145
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,405
Do you know where she is?

146
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:24,476
Are you her dad?

147
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:26,544
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?

148
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,914
Yes, I'm her father.

149
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:31,517
- She left with Tim.
- Who's Tim?

150
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,419
Hey!

151
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:37,588
Who's Tim?

152
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:38,957
He's a mailman.

153
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,859
Where is he now?

154
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:41,859
No idea.

155
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:43,261
Where does he live?

156
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,462
No... no idea.

157
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,598
What's his last name?

158
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:49,967
- Dell.
- Dell?

159
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,569
Dell.

160
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,851
You're about 35.

161
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:07,952
What do you want?

162
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:09,287
Is Andrea there?

163
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,522
Ugh, fuck off!

164
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:23,334
Hold on.

165
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,244
Hi!

166
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:33,911
- Your mother called.
- Oh.

167
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:35,347
You're intimidating.

168
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,847
Okay.

169
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:41,952
Nervous, it's a big thing for me. I
have this thing with alcohol, actually.

170
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:44,521
I feel bad, because you
probably were just worried...

171
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:46,991
Please stop. So you're fine?

172
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,459
- Yeah.
- Then I'm leaving.

173
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,462
Don't die before you get to your mother's.

174
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:51,363
So, that's it?

175
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,396
Sure... I'm done.

176
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,399
Well, I feel like we should
just... you know, um...

177
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,403
What?

178
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:00,271
Talk.

179
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:01,539
What do you want to do?

180
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:03,475
I could eat.

181
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:08,679
Oh, um... do you mind if I stay over?

182
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:14,653
So, what happened to your hand anyway?

183
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,587
Uh...

184
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:22,026
Someone shot me earlier today.

185
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:31,035
Seriously? Someone shot you? With a gun?

186
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:33,471
That's how you get shot.

187
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:34,740
Why?

188
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,609
I actually don't know.

189
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:42,347
Hey, I keep coming back here to.

190
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,381
Somebody' here with you. Hi, there.

191
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:45,415
Hello.

192
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:49,320
I just never seen you here
with anyone else, so...

193
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:50,454
I'm Andrea.

194
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,289
Cara.

195
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,658
I think I want the eggplant parmesan.

196
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,728
- Does he come here a lot?
- Oh, yeah, about everyday.

197
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,530
Wow... I guess that's...

198
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:06,404
Just visiting Dad.

199
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:09,073
Your dad?

200
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:14,411
Okay, so, you never mentioned a daughter.

201
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:19,050
Um, yeah, I don't know why.

202
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,356
Um, do you know what you want to order?

203
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,360
I want the eggplant parmesan.

204
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:31,363
I will have, chicken Caesar salad.

205
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:34,064
All right, I will be right back.

206
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:37,101
I, uh, don't have money, so...

207
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,770
Then how did you end up inebriated?

208
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:43,507
Vaginas are like coupon books for alcohol.

209
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:53,550
So, eggplant? Not chicken or veal?

210
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,051
I don't eat meat.

211
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:59,657
Really? You look like the kind of guy
who'd eat meat every chance you'd get.

212
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:02,059
If it had blood, I don't eat it.

213
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:03,160
So, you're a vegetarian?

214
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,562
I guess.

215
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:07,499
Why? Bacon exists.

216
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,533
No reason.

217
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,003
That's noble.

218
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:16,407
So, are you married now
or a like, girlfriend?

219
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:17,809
We were talking about bacon.

220
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,443
No significant other?

221
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:26,451
We just met a few hours
ago, knock it down a peg.

222
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,652
- Sorry.
- It's a little intense.

223
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:32,055
Sorry, I was just curious.

224
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:34,491
Are you still staying over tonight?

225
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,694
Uh, is that all right with you if I did?

226
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,430
How long?

227
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:40,866
Two days?

228
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,150
Ah, hot tea.

229
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:09,154
Okay, hot tea.

230
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:42,286
Oh, god. What? What, is everything okay?

231
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,188
It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

232
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,292
Yeah, okay, I just forgot
where I was for a minute.

233
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:01,773
What was that?

234
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:05,276
Nothing, go back to sleep.

235
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:08,845
Yeah, he picked me up last night.

236
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:11,315
No, he found me at the diner.

237
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:18,022
Yeah, yeah, well, I was
planning on finding a motel...

238
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:20,658
and then just coming home in the morning.

239
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,995
No. Yeah, I'm fine.

240
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:25,963
He's fine, so far.

241
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:27,798
What time is it?

242
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:31,636
Hold on. I don't know,
I don't wear a watch.

243
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:32,736
Who's on the phone?

244
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,739
Mom, eh, Gillian.

245
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:40,344
Sorry, anyway, I'm with
him now and we're fine...

246
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,950
Good afternoon.

247
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,018
Afternoon.

248
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:48,886
Where'd you end up going this morning?

249
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,287
I took a walk.

250
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,756
What, to clear your head?

251
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,326
Must be something finding out I exist.

252
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,630
I'm late. I'll be back in a minute.

253
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:01,999
Bye.

254
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,865
Let's go.

255
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,981
Talk to me.

256
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:52,850
We're here to help you, okay?

257
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:54,318
Okay?

258
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,988
I think maybe you went too far.

259
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:16,873
That's all? Huh? Is he okay?

260
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,376
Don't cry, buddy.

261
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:24,849
Oh, wow, you.

262
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:28,852
Hey, guy, how about you turn around
and get the fuck out of here, all right?

263
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:31,422
Get out of here, asshole, get out!

264
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:33,890
I need the man you're killing.

265
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:37,094
Oh, we're not kidding around.
Would you get this guy gone?

266
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:55,880
Oh... shit, my eye! Oh, fuck, man.

267
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,463
Where are your keys?

268
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:17,502
Oh, fuck, my leg. Just get
me to a hospital, please.

269
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:18,468
Where are your car keys?

270
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:21,539
I... I don't know. Jack, please.

271
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:25,510
Please, Jack, just get me to a hospital.

272
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:26,843
Are these them?

273
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:28,111
- Um...
- Are these your keys!

274
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:29,179
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,063
Hey!

276
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:48,965
Okay, who are you?

277
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:51,067
What's up? Someone just dropped him off.

278
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:55,972
Hey, where'd you go?

279
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:56,974
Nowhere.

280
00:22:57,006 --> 00:23:00,544
You left the room and
showed up two hours later.

281
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:03,214
You went somewhere.

282
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:05,882
I had to get medication.

283
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:10,554
Oh... I won't ask, because I
know most people don't like...

284
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,924
to talk about their
personal medicine stuff.

285
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:16,526
Like, I used to have this
tiny addiction to Adderall...

286
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,063
and I know I wouldn't
want to talk about it.

287
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:23,601
So, what do you want to do today?

288
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:26,570
I'm doing it.

289
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:34,946
So, are we gonna do anything today?

290
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,581
I'm still doing it.

291
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:40,584
Ooh, do you want to get
drunk and complain about Mom?

292
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:41,953
I don't drink.

293
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:46,122
Oh... no, that's good.

294
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:51,562
It's a good decision. No meat, no alcohol,
what about smoke? Do you smoke anything?

295
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:52,563
Nope.

296
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:59,904
Wow, Jesus Christ, you're boring.
I mean, what do you do all day?

297
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:02,005
Nothing much.

298
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:06,910
Nothing's... good.

299
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:08,579
Sure.

300
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:10,881
Is there a way to walk back to that bar...

301
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:13,618
because I left my car there and...

302
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,018
What time is it?

303
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:16,987
Almost 6:00.

304
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:18,155
Bingo!

305
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,264
How often do you come here?

306
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:29,066
At least three days a week.

307
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,070
Well, how many times do you win?

308
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:36,974
Eh, once a month.

309
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:41,312
Four. Here... take this.

310
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:43,046
$20, please?

311
00:24:44,581 --> 00:24:46,650
And how much money do
you get in that month?

312
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:54,659
First game is regular bingo
or four corners... $50, $50.

313
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:55,959
$100.

314
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:57,995
How much did this cost?

315
00:24:58,027 --> 00:24:59,596
$20.

316
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,564
That doesn't pay off, then.

317
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:05,970
No, no, it doesn't.

318
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:07,639
Then why do you play bingo?

319
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:13,343
Because these people don't distract me.

320
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:14,646
What?

321
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:21,619
For something to do. I
play for something to do.

322
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:23,086
Keeps me occupied.

323
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:28,326
Caller's announcing.

324
00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:32,228
N-34.

325
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:34,732
Just a line anywhere?

326
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:35,999
And the four corners.

327
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,968
B-2.

328
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:46,744
And B-1, B-1...
anybody got B-1.

329
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:49,080
So, I've noticed that we
only have two bingo cards...

330
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:52,048
but all the other senior
citizens have like ten.

331
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:53,985
I-20.

332
00:25:54,017 --> 00:25:56,319
I never play with more than two.

333
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:58,421
I don't want to keep
track of more than that.

334
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:01,258
- Oh.
- I-17.

335
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:05,396
O! O-64.
O-64.

336
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:07,230
Oh, ah, thanks.

337
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:10,301
N-41.

338
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:14,972
And the rotation continues.

339
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:20,077
Well, that was something.

340
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,312
It passes the time.

341
00:26:21,344 --> 00:26:23,213
So does drug use.

342
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:46,303
You don't even think when you're
playing bingo. Your mind's on autopilot.

343
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:49,073
No, you're definitely a
professional bingo player.

344
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:50,440
Here they are.

345
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,209
Do you like bingo?

346
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:55,146
The room full of seniors bingo?

347
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,715
- Yeah.
- I can't say I ever played.

348
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:02,119
Well, would you consider it?

349
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,219
Sure.

350
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:05,156
You should come with us sometime?

351
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,159
You play bingo?

352
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,660
You don't look like the type.

353
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:11,629
I'm less than a hundred.

354
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,668
Um, yeah, I'll go. I work
tomorrow, but I'm off the day after.

355
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,505
Nice, well, we don't do
anything, so we're also open.

356
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:25,375
All right, um, are you ready to order?

357
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:27,277
Um, I'm gonna need a minute.

358
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:31,314
Okay, I gotta work on this table
and then I will be right back.

359
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,517
- I was ready to order.
- There you go.

360
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,219
- Where I go?
- You got a date.

361
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:36,687
It's bingo.

362
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:40,091
Yes, even bingo counts, when's the
last time you were with someone anyway?

363
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:41,391
How old are you?

364
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:44,428
- 19.
- So, 19 years.

365
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:48,499
- Oh.
- Yeah.

366
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:51,468
You'll be fine. No, she's
nice... and you'll have fun.

367
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:58,442
Do you know him?

368
00:27:58,475 --> 00:27:59,776
Don't look at him.

369
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,412
- What?
- You can see him?

370
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:04,881
Yeah, why wouldn't I see him? He's solid.

371
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:08,552
Just ignore his existence,
even if he speaks to you.

372
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:10,386
Should I ask who that is?

373
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:11,522
Not at all.

374
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:13,556
- Bad guy?
- Yeah.

375
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,260
All right, fuck.

376
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:27,271
You all right?

377
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:28,104
Yeah.

378
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:30,207
You're kind of out there, aren't you?

379
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:31,842
- Probably.
- Yeah, that's okay.

380
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:34,244
Me, too.

381
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,746
Can I talk about Mom for a sec?

382
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,516
What happened between you two?

383
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:40,483
Do you know how long your
mother and I were together?

384
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:41,818
I can't say I do.

385
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:45,255
A month, no, less.

386
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:46,156
Really?

387
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:47,291
Yeah.

388
00:28:47,323 --> 00:28:48,926
Were you married before Mom?

389
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,561
- Yes.
- Really?

390
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:51,861
More than twice.

391
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:52,829
Are you guys ready?

392
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:54,430
I am, are you?

393
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:55,799
I've been ready.

394
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:57,267
- Cara!
- Yeah?

395
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:58,502
Phone.

396
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:00,838
Ugh, yeah, I'll be right there.

397
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:04,341
Sorry, so did you guys play bingo today?

398
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:05,342
Sure did.

399
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:06,776
Anybody win?

400
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,412
Nobody wins in bingo.

401
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,552
I could go for being buzzed.

402
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:17,487
Okay.

403
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,590
Can I borrow your car?

404
00:29:19,622 --> 00:29:24,361
Yeah, you should ask that
after the buzzed comment.

405
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:25,595
I can?

406
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:28,632
I don't have a car.

407
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:34,470
Right, what do you need a car
for when you only go three places.

408
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:36,674
That's the idea.

409
00:29:39,008 --> 00:29:40,443
You all right?

410
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,580
Yeah. Yeah.

411
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:09,339
- I don't see anything.
- Let's go.

412
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,282
Where are you going?

413
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:19,416
Be back in a minute.

414
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:21,552
Okay.

415
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:35,665
Jesus fucking Christ, that's
gotta be a fucking record.

416
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:37,034
I saw him drink it.

417
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:39,603
I'm just glad he didn't
kick it at the diner.

418
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:42,473
All right, let's go.

419
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,518
Aw, man, he's heavy.

420
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:57,621
The metal we fucking
wrapped him in doesn't help.

421
00:30:57,653 --> 00:31:00,423
Fucking tired, been up too long.

422
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:05,528
Agh!

423
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:08,732
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
did that just fucking happen?

424
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:11,068
Whoa, no, no, he's gonna
come back up, all right?

425
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:15,973
Come on, Larry, asshole. Swim back up.

426
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:17,507
Swim on up, asshole!

427
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,610
Fuck, what do we dive in after him?

428
00:31:19,642 --> 00:31:20,678
You fucking dive in.

429
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,512
It's fucking freezing, man!

430
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:24,380
They're gonna be askin'
us what happened to Larry.

431
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:25,715
What are we supposed to say then, Steve?

432
00:31:25,748 --> 00:31:27,450
What are we supposed to say
fucking happened to Larry?

433
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:28,485
You gotta dive in!

434
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,754
No. No, I'm not doing it.

435
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:33,590
You're right, I'm sorry.
I've been cruel to...

436
00:31:33,622 --> 00:31:35,525
Get the fuck in the water, Steve!

437
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:36,726
Agh! My eye!

438
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,699
Whoa, whoa, is that him?

439
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,101
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

440
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,669
Oh, come on, it's not him.

441
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:47,570
Who the hell else is it
gonna be, you dickhead.

442
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:48,971
It doesn't even fucking look like him!

443
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,741
Why are you even questioning
this? Of course, it's him.

444
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:53,077
Shit...

445
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:56,947
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

446
00:31:56,979 --> 00:32:00,016
He's gotta be on uppers
or bath salts or something.

447
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,019
- All right, go shoot him.
- I'm not going out there.

448
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,121
- There's no way I'm stepping out of this vehicle.
- My eye...

449
00:32:05,054 --> 00:32:07,091
We should go, we should go, we should go.

450
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:09,492
Oh, god, why is he looking at me like that?

451
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:11,628
Oh, god, oh, god, chill
out, chill out, man!

452
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,667
No, no, no! Oh god, oh god, oh god.

453
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:09,520
What happened?

454
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:10,821
Rain.

455
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:12,188
It's not raining.

456
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:15,091
It was about three miles west of here.

457
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:19,496
Where were you? I mean, The Weather
Channel said nothing about water?

458
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:21,664
I took a walk.

459
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:24,768
When you left, you didn't say where
you were going and I mean now...

460
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:37,448
You have to go now.

461
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,614
What?

462
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:43,187
Leave.

463
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:44,520
Now?

464
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:48,158
Yes, now... in the next 60 seconds.

465
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,692
Wait, what's going on?

466
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:51,527
Get out of my house.

467
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,728
Seriously?

468
00:33:52,762 --> 00:33:53,831
Yes.

469
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:55,665
I don't understand, why? What's going...

470
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:57,801
Get out, you un-aborted brat.

471
00:33:57,833 --> 00:34:01,505
I don't want you here. No one wants you.

472
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,911
Go on... fuck off.

473
00:34:12,182 --> 00:34:13,651
Fuck you.

474
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:18,655
Agh!

475
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:54,725
Hey.

476
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,780
It's extrememly rude.

477
00:35:17,814 --> 00:35:20,751
Shut the fuck up, bitch! You're
at my door every goddamn day!

478
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:21,617
Leave me the fuck alone! I turned it down!

479
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:27,590
I turned it down! Leave! Goddamn it! Jeez.

480
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:30,593
I pay my rent over here! What
else do you want from me, huh?

481
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:36,567
See you later!

482
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,202
Adios! Get the fuck out!

483
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:42,639
Fucking suck a dick, bitch!

484
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:47,010
For god sake! Hey, Lou-boy!

485
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:53,916
Fuck off, douche!

486
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:16,940
Mornin'.

487
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:17,907
Morning.

488
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:20,010
You know, you're an hour early?

489
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:21,644
Yeah.

490
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:25,948
How long you been here?

491
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:28,651
What time is it?

492
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:29,885
About 9:00.

493
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,654
I've been here since 6:00.

494
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,858
All right.

495
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:45,668
I-17...
I-17

496
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:52,042
O-75... and B-1!
Does anyone have B-1?

497
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:09,026
Hey, if you're an alcoholic or
something, I can get you something else?

498
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,130
Hey!

499
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:18,401
Oh, man...

500
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:34,017

You. How old are you?

525
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:10,472
He's old enough to fuck you up.

526
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:11,508

531

Okay.

539
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:06,155
Um.

540
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:07,357
Loser Syndrome?

541
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:09,158
Loser Syndrome.

542
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:14,231
Yeah?

543
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,035
Hey.

544
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:20,035
Hey.

545
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:21,704
What's going on?

546
00:42:21,738 --> 00:42:24,140
I don't know. Nothing.

547
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:27,410
It kind of looks like something.

548
00:42:27,443 --> 00:42:31,348
It's nothing. I'm fine.

549
00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:36,186
What was that this morning?

550
00:42:36,218 --> 00:42:37,253
Today?

551
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:40,023
You just kinda ran out.

552
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:44,994
That's right. Sorry.

553
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:50,166
I just... my head was in a bad place.

554
00:42:50,198 --> 00:42:52,401
Oh... how are you now?

555
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:55,637
Steady.

556
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:57,439
That's good.

557
00:42:57,472 --> 00:42:59,308
- Cara!
- Yeah.

558
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:00,642
You've got a call.

559
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:03,212
- Who is it?
- Who do you think?

560
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:05,081
Just let him know to stop calling?

561
00:43:05,113 --> 00:43:07,416
I do, but he's a lunatic.

562
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,454
I don't care... take care of it.

563
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,025
I, uh, I gotta take care of this, so...

564
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:16,059
Real quick, what are you havin'?

565
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:18,294
Steak, rare.

566
00:43:18,327 --> 00:43:20,130
Okay.

567
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:26,302
What about Ted? I mean,
I know he's skinny...

568
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:28,037
- but you know what they say about skinny guys, right?
- Cara...

569
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,304
your boyfriend is outside.

570
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:30,807
He's not my boyfriend.

571
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,742
I still don't care. He's
causing a disturbance.

572
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:36,813
Oh, shit, shit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

573
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:39,148
Don't be a nob.

574
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:43,486
Don't!

575
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:45,421
Oh, they're really going at it.

576
00:43:45,454 --> 00:43:46,590
Is there anyone else?

577
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:48,657
No, it's just the two of them,
but I'm calling the police.

578
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,093
Oh, come on!

579
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:53,662
Look, they're gonna start
throwing at each other, Norm! Fuck.

580
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:56,198
Cara... what the hell's wrong with her?

581
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:57,733
The guy seems borderline retarded.

582
00:43:57,767 --> 00:43:59,102
Yeah, you would know. Hello?

583
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:03,106
Yeah, I'm at Times
Square Diner, I've got...

584
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:07,811
I got it.

585
00:44:07,843 --> 00:44:10,746
Oh... um... cool.

586
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,215
Give it to me!

587
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:18,720
My own goddamn car back! God!

588
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:21,123
Give me my goddamn purse!

589
00:44:21,157 --> 00:44:25,727
Uh-huh, here you go. Take it!

590
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,532
You? What the fuck, dude?

591
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,370
I'm talking to...

592
00:44:34,403 --> 00:44:38,741
You better cut that shit out, or
I will fucking floor you! I swear!

593
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:40,709
Jack! Get the fuck out of here, just leave!

594
00:44:40,742 --> 00:44:43,479
Now, Jack! Please.

595
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:49,117
Don't!

596
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:54,257
I just get...

597
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:58,160
Ugh...

598
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:02,765
I'm taking the car!

599
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:04,167
Well, I am gettin' it back!

600
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,370
Well, whatever, bitch! Go be a whore!

601
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:09,472
Oh! How am I a whore, huh?

602
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:11,307
Tim, you do not take that car!

603
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,175
Do not take the car!

604
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:16,412
Goddamn it! Fuck!

605
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:19,314
What? Why did you do that?

606
00:45:19,347 --> 00:45:20,416
You're dating Tim?

607
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:22,751
No... I mean, well, I was...

608
00:45:22,785 --> 00:45:24,287
but we were miserably hating each other...

609
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,889
because we co-own a
car which we both need.

610
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:28,525
Oh, my god, you know Tim?

611
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:29,358
A little.

612
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:32,896
Oh, Jesus Christ, why did you do that?

613
00:45:32,928 --> 00:45:34,264
It seemed appropriate.

614
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:36,398
No, it wasn't...

615
00:45:36,432 --> 00:45:39,836
but... thanks... I guess.

616
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:44,340
Look, I know, you walk all the time.

617
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:46,342
Yup. How far are you going?

618
00:45:46,374 --> 00:45:47,843
It's about 12 blocks.

619
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:49,244
You'll be all right.

620
00:45:49,278 --> 00:45:52,415
Yeah. I'll be fine. Well, see ya.

621
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:54,883
- Take care.
- Shit.

622
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,629
So we live like six blocks from each other.

623
00:46:07,662 --> 00:46:09,331
Looks like it.

624
00:46:09,365 --> 00:46:10,633
Do you have the time, by the way?

625
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:14,403
Oh... it's 12:48.

626
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:18,407
Do you have a
middle-of-the-night appointment?

627
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:22,445
I had something, but... it's over now.

628
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:27,282
Oh, right, too busy
getting punched in the head?

629
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:32,589
Well actually, it was probably better
than the alternative I had planned.

630
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:36,326
That was amazing, by the way.

631
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:38,894
You won a fight by not doing anything.

632
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:41,296
Did you used to box or something?

633
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:42,497
A little actually.

634
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:45,367
Neat.

635
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:49,439
So, what do you do anyway?

636
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:52,941
I mean, I see you almost everyday and
then other than your name being Jack...

637
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:55,544
I don't really know anything about you.

638
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:58,614
I didn't know you had a
daughter until recently.

639
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:00,650
Where is she, by the way?

640
00:47:00,682 --> 00:47:03,552
She's probably with her
mother at this point.

641
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:05,921
Oh.

642
00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:08,023
Well, I grew up with split parents.

643
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:10,793
She'll be all right, she seems resilient.

644
00:47:10,825 --> 00:47:12,293
I like to think so.

645
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:17,300
And honestly, if I had to pick what
your daughter would sound and act like...

646
00:47:17,332 --> 00:47:19,601
...it's pretty much Andrea.

647
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:20,903
That's a shame.

648
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:24,039
No, no, that's a good thing.

649
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:28,010
You guys have like this... bantery report.

650
00:47:29,477 --> 00:47:31,481
I don't know, that stuff's important.

651
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:35,450
I didn't have that with my mom or my dad...

652
00:47:35,483 --> 00:47:39,288
and I wish I did.

653
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:42,291
Did you have it with your parents?

654
00:47:49,965 --> 00:47:53,035
Jeez. You're kind of out there, aren't you?

655
00:47:53,068 --> 00:47:54,970
Someone just told me that.

656
00:47:55,003 --> 00:47:58,473
Well, you are.

657
00:47:58,506 --> 00:48:01,010
It's the normal ones you
have to be careful about.

658
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:04,046
That's the truth and a half.

659
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,482
So, what do you do?

660
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:09,485
You never talk about yourself.

661
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:12,021
I don't do much of anything
anymore, but when I did...

662
00:48:12,053 --> 00:48:15,025
I did a little bit of everything.

663
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,463
Like what?

664
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:24,700
I was kind of a bodyguard for
a while. Then I sold antiques...

665
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:26,468
which probably made me the most.

666
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,770
I owned a few businesses.

667
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:33,409
Uh, construction for a while. Truck driver.

668
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:36,945
Teacher for a while,
history most of the time.

669
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:42,051
Military took up a good part of my life.

670
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:44,520
Manager for a whole slew of businesses.

671
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:53,028
Landscaper. Fisherman.
I bootlegged for a while.

672
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:56,465
Wreck diver. Minor...

673
00:48:56,499 --> 00:49:00,803
for coal, silver, gold.

674
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:06,609
Stunt man for movies for a while. Nurse.

675
00:49:06,642 --> 00:49:08,578
I was a medic for a while.

676
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,813
That's when I was in the military. Cook.

677
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:16,151
Prison. There's a good
amount of prison in there.

678
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:20,090
Professional gambler... horse breeder.

679
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:26,062
Potter. I made pots for a while.

680
00:49:26,095 --> 00:49:30,733
Tinsmith, then a blacksmith.

681
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:33,535
Retail for almost everything.

682
00:49:33,568 --> 00:49:34,771
Mechanic...

683
00:49:36,771 --> 00:49:38,807
- Wow.
- Yeah.

684
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,610
That's just a lot.

685
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:43,111
Yeah.

686
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:46,416
You're like a
Jack-of-all-trades.

687
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:53,555
Oh, god... um...

688
00:49:53,588 --> 00:49:58,527
Well, I went to business school
for four years to be a waitress.

689
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:01,430
What did you want to do?

690
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:05,601
I wanted to own a coffee
shop and I did for a while.

691
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:11,106
And it failed, and
then, um, I got divorced.

692
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:15,510
And I became a waitress
to get back on my feet.

693
00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:16,711
And I guess I still am,

694
00:50:16,744 --> 00:50:20,849
because I'm still at
the diner, which I hate.

695
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:25,555
But I do enjoy the lack of responsibility.

696
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:27,089
I was never a waiter.

697
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:29,459
You'd be terrible at it.

698
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:31,428
You're right, I would.

699
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:36,799
That is the most I've
heard you say, by the way.

700
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,637
That's the most I've said in years.

701
00:50:42,671 --> 00:50:45,508
Well, I'm glad I was here for it.

702
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,177
This is me, by the way.

703
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:52,215
God, I am such a wimp. You
walk to the diner everyday?

704
00:50:52,247 --> 00:50:53,816
I like walking.

705
00:50:53,849 --> 00:51:00,622
Walking, bingo, and getting punched in
the head. I know three things you like now.

706
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:03,625
That sums me up.

707
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:08,198
Well, thanks again.

708
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:39,996
Okay.

709
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,043
This could be bad.

710
00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:32,074
Nope.

711
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,385
If you're not expected to be here...

712
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:18,787
then you're not coming in.

713
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,756
Let me in, Gary.

714
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,693
- Jack?
- Yeah.

715
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:26,696
- Haven't see you in a while.
- Yeah.

716
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:28,464
If you're not expected to be
here, you're not coming in.

717
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:29,865
- Open the door!
- Hey, take a walk!

718
00:54:29,898 --> 00:54:32,068
You're not coming in,
especially this early.

719
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:33,869
Go ask Tom if I can come in.

720
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:36,005
- Tom's dead!
- Tom's dead?

721
00:54:36,037 --> 00:54:37,740
Yeah, he sure as hell is.

722
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:40,443
Yeah, he is dead.

723
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:41,843
Who's in charge then?

724
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:43,044
Alex.

725
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:44,146
Go ask Alex.

726
00:54:44,178 --> 00:54:45,414
He's getting ready for bed.

727
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:47,749
Then he can talk.

728
00:54:49,918 --> 00:54:51,753
All right.

729
00:55:03,765 --> 00:55:06,401
Hey, man! Outside!

730
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:07,769
We need to talk.

731
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:13,875
Hey, Jack. Wow.

732
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:15,811
I see you found your way in.

733
00:55:15,843 --> 00:55:17,880
Come on, man... we're going back outside.

734
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:19,514
No, it's all right. Get some sleep.

735
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:20,616
You don't need me around?

736
00:55:20,648 --> 00:55:23,418
That's all right. We're
fine. Jack, you need anything?

737
00:55:23,452 --> 00:55:24,887
- Smoothie?
- No.

738
00:55:24,919 --> 00:55:27,523
See? Look, we're good, all
right? Good job tonight.

739
00:55:27,555 --> 00:55:29,124
Okay. See you tonight.

740
00:55:29,157 --> 00:55:31,092
Hey, you, ah, leave that door open?

741
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:33,796
I didn't close it.

742
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:35,832
Fucking Jack.

743
00:55:37,965 --> 00:55:41,836
Hm. So, Jack

744
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:44,105
what'd you think of that new door?

745
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:47,409
It's the best we could do
to replace your security.

746
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:50,813
I think if someone wants
to get in, they can get in.

747
00:55:50,845 --> 00:55:56,017
Oh, heh, so where've you been?

748
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:59,053
I mean, you seemed to fall off the map...

749
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:01,791
after you "retired" is that the word?

750
00:56:01,823 --> 00:56:04,959
I really haven't done much of anything
since I stopped working for Tom.

751
00:56:04,992 --> 00:56:09,465
Yeah, Dad was devastated
when you went and did that.

752
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:11,432
I don't care.

753
00:56:11,465 --> 00:56:14,402
Did you order a kidnapping
on an Andrea Huntsman?

754
00:56:14,436 --> 00:56:17,072
Excuse me. Who's that?

755
00:56:17,104 --> 00:56:18,573
Friend of the family.

756
00:56:18,606 --> 00:56:23,445
Ooh, family. Never
heard you mention family.

757
00:56:23,477 --> 00:56:27,849
Was beginning to think that you
just crawled out of the ground.

758
00:56:27,883 --> 00:56:30,119
Answer my question.

759
00:56:30,151 --> 00:56:32,521
I don't know her, all right?

760
00:56:32,553 --> 00:56:35,490
And besides, that stuff
was my dad's racket.

761
00:56:35,523 --> 00:56:37,458
I just own this club now.

762
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:39,961
Is that a no?

763
00:56:39,994 --> 00:56:43,565
Yes, that's a no, Jesus, Jack!

764
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,568
Do you have anything besides
being ambiguous and hostile?

765
00:56:46,602 --> 00:56:49,071
Have you heard about
the kidnapping? Anything?

766
00:56:49,104 --> 00:56:53,108
No, no, I've never even heard of...

767
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,175
Andrea Huntsman.

768
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:56,579
"Andrea Huntsman!"

769
00:56:56,611 --> 00:57:01,150
All right! Until you brought
her up. Same thing with you.

770
00:57:01,182 --> 00:57:03,552
You weren't even on my radar...

771
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:07,622
until Gary mentioned your name like
30 seconds before you walked in.

772
00:57:10,224 --> 00:57:12,961
...drugs, or push anything!

773
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:15,163
I just run the place.

774
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:18,568
- Seriously.
- All right.

775
00:57:20,235 --> 00:57:21,938
Aren't you gonna ask about Dad?

776
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:26,876
I heard he was dead.

777
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:29,311
Nice to hear that your
finger's on the pulse. Hm?

778
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,246
His cardiac pump fail?

779
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,383
Yeah, must have died out a short
time after the car ran him over.

780
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:35,551
Hm.

781
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:40,489
Hey, if you need work again,
I can get you a bouncer's gig.

782
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:43,992
All right? If not here, somewhere else.

783
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:45,527
You'll never see me again.

784
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:47,329
All right...

785
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:52,001
Good luck! With... everything.

786
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:20,262
I-17.

787
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:31,673
Hey, he's coming.

788
00:59:16,684 --> 00:59:18,152
Hey.

789
00:59:18,186 --> 00:59:19,421
What's happening?

790
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:20,756
Um, coffee?

791
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:23,258
No. What? No.

792
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:25,026
- No, no, no.
- Oops, sorry.

793
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:27,996
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

794
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,064
Help.

795
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:38,239
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

796
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:39,675
Okay.

797
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:14,476
Are you ready to order?

798
01:00:14,508 --> 01:00:16,411
- Sit down.
- No.

799
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:17,479
Sit down.

800
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:19,081
What is going on?

801
01:00:19,113 --> 01:00:21,383
Please sit down.

802
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:25,254
Oh, god, holy shit!

803
01:00:25,287 --> 01:00:27,189
- Huh?
- Your back...

804
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:37,466
Oh, my god, Jack, you're
bleeding. Are you okay?

805
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:40,235
Yeah... ice pick.

806
01:00:40,267 --> 01:00:42,170
- Sit down.
- No, no...

807
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:45,441
No, I... I am gonna go get you some towels.

808
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:48,443
Cara... sit down.

809
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:49,512
Sit down.

810
01:00:57,485 --> 01:00:59,353
You were supposed to be off today.

811
01:00:59,387 --> 01:01:01,789
Uh, yeah, um, Georgia called in sick.

812
01:01:01,822 --> 01:01:03,691
Oh, my god, what is going on?

813
01:01:03,724 --> 01:01:05,360
Don't worry about it.

814
01:01:08,863 --> 01:01:10,432
Are they here because of you?

815
01:01:10,465 --> 01:01:12,267
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

816
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,102
Okay, who are they, Jack?

817
01:01:14,135 --> 01:01:16,505
I don't know. some kind
of low-class mafia, maybe.

818
01:01:16,537 --> 01:01:19,440
And what do they want with you?

819
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:21,142
I don't know.

820
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:23,511
They showed up a few days
ago, and we had interactions.

821
01:01:23,544 --> 01:01:24,780
Oh, my god.

822
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:26,347
Did you get your car back?

823
01:01:30,385 --> 01:01:31,887
Um, yeah.

824
01:01:31,919 --> 01:01:32,787
Can I get a ride?

825
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:34,322
- Now?
- Yeah.

826
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:36,358
- Okay.
- Good.

827
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:39,360
Now you should go sit
over with your co-workers.

828
01:01:39,394 --> 01:01:41,464
- Why?
- You'll understand in a minute.

829
01:01:48,202 --> 01:01:49,771
Fuck.

830
01:01:56,378 --> 01:01:58,546
See, I told you! What did I tell you?

831
01:02:17,264 --> 01:02:19,167
- Get off me!
- Let's go!

832
01:02:20,468 --> 01:02:21,803
Not the time for that.

833
01:02:21,836 --> 01:02:25,474
What the fuck is going on?

834
01:02:25,506 --> 01:02:28,510
Oh, holy shit, you need an ambulance.

835
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:30,278
- Come on!
- No, I...

836
01:02:33,447 --> 01:02:35,383
Hang tight for a minute.

837
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:39,554
What? Jack... Jack!

838
01:03:00,941 --> 01:03:03,678
What in god's name are you doing?

839
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:07,415
Will he fit in your trunk?

840
01:03:07,448 --> 01:03:08,550
Put him down.

841
01:03:08,582 --> 01:03:09,818
Can he fit in your trunk?

842
01:03:09,851 --> 01:03:12,287
No, you are not putting him in my trunk!

843
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,588
Why not? He's not dead.

844
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:15,824
No!

845
01:03:15,856 --> 01:03:17,592
They have Andrea.

846
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:22,264
- Your daughter?
- Yeah, my daughter.

847
01:03:22,296 --> 01:03:26,399
They have her, and she maybe
already dead, but I have to try.

848
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:28,437
No, no, I don't believe that.

849
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,305
- Why not?
- God, I don't know.

850
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:31,473
- I don't know.
- We need to go.

851
01:03:31,506 --> 01:03:34,009
No, no, no, fuck you, Jack!

852
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:36,410
Cara, you said you'd give me a ride.

853
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:41,550
Uh, well, Jesus Christ, I
was confused and terrified.

854
01:03:41,582 --> 01:03:44,220
I'll give you one million dollars, cash.

855
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:50,324
Where do you have a million dollars?

856
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:52,394
I have one millions dollars. Honest.

857
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:53,629
One million dollars?

858
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:56,298
Life-changing money.

859
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:14,582
- Is that my tool box?
- Yeah.

860
01:04:14,615 --> 01:04:18,253
- Can I use your too...
- Could you just not look at me?

861
01:04:20,088 --> 01:04:24,993
It's just the... you know, the
blood and the holes in your head.

862
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:28,697
Oh, god, just don't look at me!

863
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:30,666
Okay.

864
01:04:50,418 --> 01:04:51,753
Can we go now?

865
01:04:51,785 --> 01:04:54,689
What the fuck are you doing?

866
01:04:54,722 --> 01:04:59,327
If I leave the bullets
in, it'll heal over...

867
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,996
and I'll get migraines.

868
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:09,705
But you... god, you have
no problem doing that?

869
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:13,409
I have pliers in my head. It hurts.

870
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:16,411
I don't... I don't know how that works.

871
01:05:16,443 --> 01:05:18,746
How come you're not
brain dead or something?

872
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,615
I should be.

873
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:31,660
But I'm not.

874
01:05:31,693 --> 01:05:34,129
Oh, god.

875
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:35,664
Can we go?

876
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:40,035
Jack? What are you gonna do with him?

877
01:05:40,068 --> 01:05:41,069
Talk to him.

878
01:05:41,102 --> 01:05:43,004
Well, he's unconscious.

879
01:05:43,037 --> 01:05:44,773
Not right away.

880
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:45,807
What are you gonna do when you do...

881
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,108
Jack?

882
01:05:49,677 --> 01:05:51,613
Ruth.

883
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:54,416
You wouldn't know where
Ben has been, would you?

884
01:05:54,448 --> 01:05:55,816
Ben?

885
01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:58,552
The young man who lives across from you.

886
01:05:58,586 --> 01:06:00,822
Uh, no, no.

887
01:06:00,854 --> 01:06:05,726
Well, I haven't seen him for a few
days and well, I was wondering...

888
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,397
if he'd gone to sleep
at a friend's home or...

889
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:12,734
maybe gone away on vacation,
but if he did, he should tell me.

890
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:15,504
If I see him, I'll let you know.

891
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:18,540
Thank you, take care then.

892
01:06:18,572 --> 01:06:19,673
Hello.

893
01:06:19,706 --> 01:06:21,109
Hi.

894
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:36,892
- Ugh, take it easy, man.
- Ah, fuck.

895
01:08:10,151 --> 01:08:13,755
Remigny, 1914.

896
01:08:15,689 --> 01:08:17,858
That was France.

897
01:08:17,892 --> 01:08:21,196
I had a hard time
readjusting to the language.

898
01:08:21,228 --> 01:08:23,631
It changed quite a bit since
the last time I needed it.

899
01:08:23,665 --> 01:08:24,799
This is you?

900
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:25,967
Yeah.

901
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,638
It's not your dad or your granddad?

902
01:08:31,572 --> 01:08:33,275
I'm not even sure if I had a father.

903
01:08:33,308 --> 01:08:37,778
This person, in this picture, is you?

904
01:08:37,812 --> 01:08:39,581
Yeah.

905
01:08:39,613 --> 01:08:41,182
From 1914?

906
01:08:41,214 --> 01:08:42,182
Yeah.

907
01:08:42,215 --> 01:08:44,285
I don't believe that.

908
01:08:44,318 --> 01:08:45,286
Okay.

909
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:53,628
How?

910
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:55,263
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

911
01:08:55,295 --> 01:08:56,564
I mean, I don't know.

912
01:08:56,598 --> 01:08:58,300
That doesn't make any sense.

913
01:08:58,332 --> 01:08:59,968
I didn't say it would.

914
01:09:04,272 --> 01:09:07,309
Wine is supposed to mature with age...

915
01:09:07,342 --> 01:09:10,010
but I think 450 years may make it bitter.

916
01:09:10,044 --> 01:09:11,613
What?

917
01:09:11,646 --> 01:09:12,981
It's British.

918
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:20,889
And that wasn't wine.

919
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:23,791
Okay.

920
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:25,693
No.

921
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:27,963
Nope... it is not possible.

922
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:32,968
You just saw me put pliers in
my head to pull out a bullet.

923
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,302
Old age was never a concern of mine.

924
01:09:35,335 --> 01:09:37,638
That means you're over...

925
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,710
150 years old.

926
01:09:42,744 --> 01:09:45,045
Not even close.

927
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:46,814
How old are you?

928
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:48,683
I have no idea.

929
01:09:48,715 --> 01:09:50,718
But I'm in the Bible,
if that means anything.

930
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:52,321
What?

931
01:09:53,353 --> 01:09:54,755
No.

932
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:57,258
It is pronounced "Cayenne"...

933
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,628
but I'm known as Cain.

934
01:10:04,331 --> 01:10:06,000
I think I'm gonna throw up.

935
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:08,870
I'm going to go interrogate
the man in my bathroom.

936
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:12,707
Your money's there.

937
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:15,809
I can just leave?

938
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:18,813
I don't see why not?

939
01:10:18,845 --> 01:10:21,383
You'll never see me again.

940
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:52,781
Oh, man, what are you doin'?

941
01:10:55,782 --> 01:10:58,419
I'm not a fan of nine millimeters.

942
01:10:58,452 --> 01:11:00,722
I prefer something that can go through me.

943
01:11:00,754 --> 01:11:02,356
Yeah, okay.

944
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:17,839
Is Derrick someone worth speaking to?

945
01:11:17,871 --> 01:11:20,909
I... I don't... I don't know.

946
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:22,944
Do you do illegal activities with Derrick?

947
01:11:22,977 --> 01:11:28,049
Uh... ah, yeah, yeah. What are you gonna...

948
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:30,751
Hello.

949
01:11:30,785 --> 01:11:31,753
<i>Stevie!</i>

950
01:11:31,786 --> 01:11:33,221
No.

951
01:11:33,254 --> 01:11:35,090
<i>Then why in the holy fuck
are you handling a phone...</i>

952
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:37,125
<i>that's not yours, where's Steve?</i>

953
01:11:44,464 --> 01:11:46,333
He's tied up in my bathroom right now.

954
01:11:46,366 --> 01:11:48,135
<i>Tied up in... who are you?</i>

955
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:49,403
Where's Andrea?

956
01:11:49,437 --> 01:11:50,205
<i>Who are you?</i>

957
01:11:50,237 --> 01:11:51,639
Where's Andrea?

958
01:11:51,673 --> 01:11:54,275
<i>Are you that Jack scumbag
that's giving me trouble?</i>

959
01:11:54,308 --> 01:11:55,476
I'm Jack.

960
01:11:55,509 --> 01:11:57,812
<i>- Motherfucker!
- Put Steve on the phone.</i>

961
01:11:57,844 --> 01:11:59,179
Where's Andrea?

962
01:11:59,213 --> 01:12:01,782
<i>Put him on the fucking
phone, you fucking fuck!</i>

963
01:12:09,022 --> 01:12:10,991
Do you know what I'm talking about?

964
01:12:11,025 --> 01:12:13,061
Yeah, yeah, the girl...
the girl with the lip thing?

965
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:14,162
That's her.

966
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:16,865
Yeah... that was us.

967
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:18,365
- Why?
- I don't know.

968
01:12:18,398 --> 01:12:21,001
We were hired, I think.
I mean, I'm kind of new.

969
01:12:21,035 --> 01:12:25,039
I'm not really the guy
to talk to about that.

970
01:12:25,071 --> 01:12:26,840
Where is she?

971
01:12:26,874 --> 01:12:27,974
I don't know that, either.

972
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:30,178
We just dropped her off to
the guy that hired us... so...

973
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,012
You weren't at the docks last night?

974
01:12:32,045 --> 01:12:33,781
I don't even know what that means.

975
01:12:33,814 --> 01:12:35,517
I got a call, that if I
didn't show up at the docks...

976
01:12:35,549 --> 01:12:36,918
at midnight, they'd kill her.

977
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:39,420
Oh, yeah, last night, right?

978
01:12:39,452 --> 01:12:40,521
Midnight.

979
01:12:40,554 --> 01:12:44,025
Yeah, no, we... they dropped
her off earlier than that.

980
01:12:44,058 --> 01:12:47,095
Maybe around 5:00?

981
01:12:47,128 --> 01:12:50,865
- To who?
- I don't know, man, please?

982
01:12:50,897 --> 01:12:54,535
I'm sorry. Please don't kill me.

983
01:12:54,568 --> 01:12:56,804
- Yeah. <i>
- Never hold me on the phone.</i>

984
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:58,139
<i>What's wrong with your fucking head?</i>

985
01:12:58,171 --> 01:13:00,508
<i>This isn't a fucking
game. I'm not playing.</i>

986
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,577
Who did you drop Andrea
Huntsman off to yesterday?

987
01:13:03,611 --> 01:13:09,217
<i>Stop fucking interrupting me, you fucking
fuck! What the fuck is wrong with you? I...</i>

988
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,251
Derrick again.

989
01:13:10,284 --> 01:13:10,884
Can I talk to him?

990
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:12,821
What are you going to say?

991
01:13:12,853 --> 01:13:16,423
I'm gonna tell him that I am fine
and he should leave you alone.

992
01:13:16,456 --> 01:13:17,023
You'll do that?

993
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:18,393
Yeah, I don't want to die.

994
01:13:18,425 --> 01:13:21,963
<i>Put him on the fucking
phone, you fucking fuck!</i>

995
01:13:21,995 --> 01:13:26,834
Hey, it's me, Derrick. No, no, it's Steve.

996
01:13:26,867 --> 01:13:30,071
No, just talk slower, okay?

997
01:13:30,103 --> 01:13:36,143
No, he hasn't hurt me...
again, not since the diner.

998
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:40,180
Could be worse. No, no, I
don't think that's a good idea.

999
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:46,054
No, that's a bad idea. That
was bad, no, no, don't do that.

1000
01:13:46,086 --> 01:13:47,955
He... he hung up.

1001
01:13:50,057 --> 01:13:52,059
What's happening?

1002
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:53,561
They're sending someone over.

1003
01:13:53,594 --> 01:13:55,964
- Here?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1004
01:13:55,996 --> 01:13:57,030
They're right outside?

1005
01:13:57,063 --> 01:13:58,900
- Yeah.
- Do you know who they're sending?

1006
01:13:58,933 --> 01:14:01,002
- Personally?
- Yeah.

1007
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:05,039
Yeah, I mean, a little bit. I mean, it's
Vinny, he plays pinball, right, so...

1008
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:07,207
Would you be broken up if I murdered him?

1009
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:08,576
Are you gonna kill me?

1010
01:14:08,608 --> 01:14:10,879
- Probably not.
- Then I got no problem with it.

1011
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,648
Ugh... he's here.

1012
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,915
Oh, fuck, man, I'm sorry.

1013
01:14:14,948 --> 01:14:16,617
How did you find me anyway?

1014
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:20,220
The guy we dropped the girl off to, he gave
us your hang contact info and hang out areas.

1015
01:14:20,254 --> 01:14:25,994
You know, we were... they were,
uh, mad about the dock thing.

1016
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:29,063
Good to know.

1017
01:14:29,095 --> 01:14:33,200
Yeah... yeah, thanks. Holy, fuck.

1018
01:14:38,638 --> 01:14:41,074
Here he is!

1019
01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:42,309
You were supposed to leave.

1020
01:14:42,343 --> 01:14:44,178
I needed a minute.

1021
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:46,313
Shut up.

1022
01:14:46,347 --> 01:14:47,348
Let's go, Jack.

1023
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,082
All right, leave her behind.

1024
01:14:49,116 --> 01:14:52,053
Fine, whatever... come on!

1025
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:07,168
Again?

1026
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:09,570
- I know.
- Oh, my god.

1027
01:15:09,603 --> 01:15:11,706
Are you good to go now,
because I'm leaving?

1028
01:15:11,738 --> 01:15:15,343
Yeah, are you sure I can have this?

1029
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:18,312
Go nuts. I'll sell something
if I need the money.

1030
01:15:31,092 --> 01:15:32,727
See you around.

1031
01:15:32,759 --> 01:15:35,095
What, are we done? You're not gonna...

1032
01:15:35,129 --> 01:15:36,997
Looks like it.

1033
01:17:08,789 --> 01:17:13,760
Leginum... Convictio...

1034
01:17:13,794 --> 01:17:20,233
Scientia... V er titia.

1035
01:18:33,907 --> 01:18:35,509
Hey, up.

1036
01:18:38,812 --> 01:18:44,418
Oh, wow, Jack. What's shakin'?

1037
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:47,855
Those mobsters you owe money
to, do you know who they are?

1038
01:18:47,888 --> 01:18:49,890
I don't know what you're talking about.

1039
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:52,293
The mobsters who split your leg?

1040
01:18:52,326 --> 01:18:54,362
Oh, yeah, hard to forget.

1041
01:18:54,394 --> 01:18:55,763
Do you have any idea who they were?

1042
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:59,799
No, I've never seen them before. I
think they're more like hired goons.

1043
01:18:59,832 --> 01:19:01,936
Are you supposed to be in here?

1044
01:19:01,969 --> 01:19:05,607
Sure. Where'd you take the loan out from?

1045
01:19:08,342 --> 01:19:11,845
I met up with some guy to give me a loan...

1046
01:19:11,879 --> 01:19:15,249
to pay off my student loans.

1047
01:19:15,281 --> 01:19:17,317
It was at some bar-like thing.

1048
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:18,818
What's it called?

1049
01:19:18,852 --> 01:19:21,555
Um, Arcudi's.

1050
01:19:21,589 --> 01:19:25,193
The head honcho there, last
name happen to be Miller?

1051
01:19:25,226 --> 01:19:27,361
No, no, no, no, Arcudi.

1052
01:19:27,393 --> 01:19:30,430
Yeah, I think his name
was the same as the bar.

1053
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:32,500
Does a first name come to mind?

1054
01:19:32,532 --> 01:19:35,902
Alex. Alex Arcudi.

1055
01:19:35,936 --> 01:19:39,874
I didn't think he'd ever
do something like that.

1056
01:19:39,906 --> 01:19:46,546
But, uh, Jack... I never got
a chance to say thank you.

1057
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,483
You know, I...

1058
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:54,655
No! No! You said I would
never see you again...

1059
01:19:54,687 --> 01:19:56,556
and here you are, an hour later.

1060
01:19:56,589 --> 01:19:58,425
I need a car and a driver this time.

1061
01:19:58,459 --> 01:20:01,229
You're a murdering lunatic. Go steal a car.

1062
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:03,264
I need someone to take Andrea.

1063
01:20:06,599 --> 01:20:08,369
You know where Andrea is?

1064
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:10,905
- I think so.
- Fuck! Fuck.

1065
01:20:10,937 --> 01:20:13,873
If that's the case, I need someone
on standby when things come together.

1066
01:20:13,906 --> 01:20:17,344
No, I am so fucking screwed
up from tonight, Jack.

1067
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:20,548
If you do it, I'll give
you this duffel bag...

1068
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:25,252
and your family, and your family's
family will never have to work again.

1069
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:29,690
I don't know what you don't
understand about this. I refuse.

1070
01:20:29,723 --> 01:20:31,392
Okay?

1071
01:20:31,424 --> 01:20:34,494
You're probably just gonna go
kill another room full of people.

1072
01:20:34,527 --> 01:20:35,996
- You are?
- Probably.

1073
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:38,499
Come on! Fuck!

1074
01:20:44,037 --> 01:20:45,438
So, you're like a vam...

1075
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:48,009
Can we not speak of it.

1076
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:50,510
Are you telling me that you guys exist?

1077
01:20:50,544 --> 01:20:54,616
Yes, but I'm it.

1078
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:04,491
How come you don't have the... teeth?

1079
01:21:07,361 --> 01:21:08,696
Why would I need them?

1080
01:21:10,563 --> 01:21:12,967
Um, that means that you...

1081
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,673
No, don't, don't. Stop... please.

1082
01:21:19,772 --> 01:21:21,675
Okay.

1083
01:21:26,379 --> 01:21:31,551
So, the... the Civil
War... what was that like?

1084
01:21:35,555 --> 01:21:39,360
I don't know. I was in China.

1085
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,469
Here we are.

1086
01:21:50,737 --> 01:21:53,374
- You can stay here.
- Yeah, I was going to.

1087
01:21:53,406 --> 01:21:55,742
Give me your telephone number, so I can
call and let you know what's going on.

1088
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:58,546
609-555-4382.

1089
01:21:58,579 --> 01:21:59,546
- Okay.
- 609...

1090
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,715
I got it.

1091
01:22:02,816 --> 01:22:04,518
Right, of course you do.

1092
01:22:08,388 --> 01:22:09,622
Is that a finger?

1093
01:22:09,656 --> 01:22:10,524
Let me in, Gary.

1094
01:22:10,557 --> 01:22:12,693
Not tonight, Jack. Fuck off somewhere else.

1095
01:22:12,726 --> 01:22:13,994
Open the door.

1096
01:22:14,027 --> 01:22:15,330
Not happening, Jack.

1097
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:37,650
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, where
do you think you're going?

1098
01:22:37,683 --> 01:22:39,652
Hey, buddy, where you going?

1099
01:22:39,686 --> 01:22:42,590
Hey, asshole, I'm talking to you!

1100
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,728
What the fuck was that?

1101
01:22:48,762 --> 01:22:50,398
Did you fucking shoot somebody?

1102
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,098
Man, didn't you hear that shit?

1103
01:22:52,131 --> 01:22:54,101
He just fucking murdered Gary!

1104
01:22:54,134 --> 01:22:55,703
- Who?
- That dude!

1105
01:22:55,736 --> 01:22:57,171
Who the fuck did you shoot?

1106
01:22:57,204 --> 01:22:58,706
Also, that dude!

1107
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:00,174
I don't get it.

1108
01:23:00,206 --> 01:23:01,842
You might want to clear out.

1109
01:23:07,714 --> 01:23:09,117
Okay.

1110
01:23:15,488 --> 01:23:17,759
Agh!

1111
01:23:45,219 --> 01:23:46,454
Are you Derrick?

1112
01:23:46,487 --> 01:23:47,822
Yeah, motherfucker!

1113
01:24:20,286 --> 01:24:23,557
I'm gonna have to call you in a bit.

1114
01:24:23,589 --> 01:24:24,624
Where's Andrea?

1115
01:24:24,657 --> 01:24:25,558
Where's Gary?

1116
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:27,661
Do you really want to
slow this process down?

1117
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:31,531
Fuck! Agh! No!

1118
01:24:31,564 --> 01:24:33,500
It wasn't supposed to play like this!

1119
01:24:33,534 --> 01:24:35,603
What does that mean?

1120
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:44,844
Oh, god, that's right. You're strong.

1121
01:24:44,878 --> 01:24:46,514
Yup.

1122
01:24:51,183 --> 01:24:53,553
Don't go anywhere.

1123
01:24:53,586 --> 01:24:56,756
Those are called books, Jack!

1124
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:58,125
Shut the fuck up.

1125
01:25:12,673 --> 01:25:14,909
Get away from me. No, don't.

1126
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:27,621
Andrea... it's me, Jack.

1127
01:25:27,653 --> 01:25:30,223
I'm getting you out of here.

1128
01:25:45,304 --> 01:25:46,773
Can you walk?

1129
01:25:46,807 --> 01:25:48,776
I...

1130
01:25:48,808 --> 01:25:51,644
Okay, okay. Stay here.

1131
01:25:51,678 --> 01:25:53,247
I'll be right back.

1132
01:25:57,851 --> 01:26:01,321
Shit, I didn't get anywhere!

1133
01:26:01,354 --> 01:26:05,692
Ow, agh.

1134
01:26:12,299 --> 01:26:13,867
I have Andrea.

1135
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,972
Meet me outside the front
door. I'll be right there.

1136
01:26:18,004 --> 01:26:22,308
I have to say, I'm shocked...

1137
01:26:22,342 --> 01:26:24,612
shocked that you came back for her.

1138
01:26:24,644 --> 01:26:28,816
I didn't... you're not the
reason I'm here, either.

1139
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:30,617
All this is for me.

1140
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:35,022
What the hell you doing?

1141
01:26:35,054 --> 01:26:36,255
I want you to stay put.

1142
01:26:36,289 --> 01:26:37,992
No, no, no!

1143
01:26:38,025 --> 01:26:40,393
No, no, no!

1144
01:26:40,427 --> 01:26:42,662
Agh!

1145
01:26:46,433 --> 01:26:47,835
I'll be back.

1146
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:52,005
Whatever!

1147
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:58,379
Oh, my god... she needs an ambulance.

1148
01:26:58,411 --> 01:27:01,714
No... she'd be the last
priority if they came here.

1149
01:27:01,747 --> 01:27:03,317
Now, hold on, what do you want me to do?

1150
01:27:03,349 --> 01:27:06,419
Take her to the hospital,
forget you ever knew me.

1151
01:27:06,452 --> 01:27:08,856
No, no, Jack, she's really hurt.

1152
01:27:08,888 --> 01:27:10,323
Oh, my god, no. I need help.

1153
01:27:10,357 --> 01:27:11,959
- You'll make it.
- Okay, what are you going?

1154
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:13,059
I'm staying.

1155
01:27:13,093 --> 01:27:14,361
Jack, what the hell does that mean?

1156
01:27:14,393 --> 01:27:16,664
It means I'm staying,
now get her out of here!

1157
01:27:16,696 --> 01:27:21,067
No, Jack! Jack! Jack! Fuck.

1158
01:27:22,436 --> 01:27:22,836
Okay.

1159
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:27,840
Oh...
ha-ha-ha.

1160
01:27:27,874 --> 01:27:32,112
Is there anything I can
say to make you leave.

1161
01:27:35,115 --> 01:27:38,818
I've killed nine-year-olds
for no reason at all.

1162
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,690
What makes you think you have a chance?

1163
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:51,098
Heh-heh... oh, fuck!

1164
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:53,467
What was the camera for in the bathroom?

1165
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,336
Oh...

1166
01:27:56,369 --> 01:28:01,909
we were gonna beat the shit out
of Andrea and mail it to you.

1167
01:28:03,744 --> 01:28:06,345
Why would you do that?

1168
01:28:06,379 --> 01:28:08,849
Piss you off.

1169
01:28:08,881 --> 01:28:10,451
Why?

1170
01:28:10,483 --> 01:28:13,821
Because, Jack!

1171
01:28:13,853 --> 01:28:20,827
You're special, and shooting you
just doesn't have the same impact...

1172
01:28:20,861 --> 01:28:24,064
as it does on a normal person!

1173
01:28:24,097 --> 01:28:29,737
You kidnapped and tortured
Andrea to get to me?

1174
01:28:29,769 --> 01:28:33,941
You put it together, Jack. Yay.

1175
01:28:37,777 --> 01:28:40,146
Oh, come on!

1176
01:28:40,179 --> 01:28:45,018
Agh, my fucking ankle!

1177
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:55,995
Fuck!

1178
01:28:58,932 --> 01:29:01,367
So you hired outside contractors...

1179
01:29:01,401 --> 01:29:03,336
so you could claim anonymity.

1180
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:04,338
Yeah.

1181
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:06,205
And then I guess you
found out I was involved...

1182
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:08,207
when I helped Jeremy
out with his loan thing.

1183
01:29:08,241 --> 01:29:10,511
Oh, fucking Jeremy.

1184
01:29:10,544 --> 01:29:12,446
And then you told them where to find me...

1185
01:29:12,478 --> 01:29:15,448
and they found out about Andrea?

1186
01:29:15,482 --> 01:29:21,822
I thought she was some weekend
prostitute or something along those lines.

1187
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:25,992
I was shocked to find out
you actually had a kid.

1188
01:29:26,026 --> 01:29:27,427
Didn't really work out.

1189
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:30,997
No. No, it didn't.

1190
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:35,435
This grudge we have, I'm assuming
it's from me murdering your father.

1191
01:29:35,468 --> 01:29:38,104
Fucking aye, cockhead!

1192
01:29:38,138 --> 01:29:40,207
How'd you find out?

1193
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:46,546
Really? Day you left, Dad
died, everyone had an alibi.

1194
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:51,018
Ruled you in. Was it really
that much of a stretch?

1195
01:29:57,924 --> 01:30:01,961
Well, I like to stay under the radar...

1196
01:30:01,995 --> 01:30:04,965
but your dad had other ideas.

1197
01:30:04,997 --> 01:30:08,201
So, that's that.

1198
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:12,139
Were you gonna kill Andrea?

1199
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:16,576
And refrain from lying.

1200
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,277
How would you know if I'm lying?

1201
01:30:18,311 --> 01:30:20,013
You'll say no.

1202
01:30:20,045 --> 01:30:23,916
- Then there's your answer.
- Hmph.

1203
01:30:43,036 --> 01:30:45,906
Jack!

1204
01:30:47,674 --> 01:30:51,578
Jack, do you know my blood type?

1205
01:30:51,611 --> 01:30:55,983
Jack! Huh? What's my blood type?

1206
01:30:56,015 --> 01:30:58,518
You know my blood type?

1207
01:31:01,153 --> 01:31:05,025
- Nope. Not yet.
- Agh!

1208
01:31:08,961 --> 01:31:15,268
Jack, Jack, I hate you. I hate you!

1209
01:31:27,613 --> 01:31:30,918
I was doing pretty well for a while.

1210
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:34,321
I was walking the tight rope of sobriety.

1211
01:31:36,156 --> 01:31:41,195
Then your revenge stunt made
me fall right off the wagon.

1212
01:31:49,001 --> 01:31:52,972
I'm going to kill you.
I want you to know that.

1213
01:31:55,642 --> 01:31:59,679
But I want you to know,
I'm going to eat you.

1214
01:31:59,713 --> 01:32:05,018
I am literally going to
tear you apart and eat you.

1215
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:09,389
Keep in mind, it's not because I want to.

1216
01:32:11,256 --> 01:32:14,327
I don't know why...

1217
01:32:14,361 --> 01:32:16,729
but I have to.

1218
01:32:16,763 --> 01:32:19,633
It's the way it's always been... always.

1219
01:32:21,768 --> 01:32:24,939
It keeps my mind straight.

1220
01:32:27,374 --> 01:32:30,677
But how sane can you be in the first
place, if you have to fucking eat people?

1221
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:33,447
I don't know.

1222
01:32:42,054 --> 01:32:44,991
What? Why?

1223
01:32:45,025 --> 01:32:48,995
Why now? For him?

1224
01:32:49,028 --> 01:32:51,697
That man's a murderer and he's aware of it!

1225
01:32:51,731 --> 01:32:55,001
The world would be a better
place if I killed him, right now.

1226
01:32:55,035 --> 01:32:57,204
I've tortured thousands of
innocent people to death...

1227
01:32:57,237 --> 01:32:59,106
and you weren't around for them!

1228
01:32:59,138 --> 01:33:01,775
You weren't even around
for Egypt. Or Walachilla!

1229
01:33:01,808 --> 01:33:05,679
I impaled thousands of people
in Walachilla just see them die.

1230
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:10,217
Look at me. Look at me!

1231
01:33:13,053 --> 01:33:15,287
Fuck you! I hate you!

1232
01:33:15,321 --> 01:33:18,725
I hate this fucking place, all of it!

1233
01:33:18,758 --> 01:33:20,394
Who are you talking to?

1234
01:33:20,427 --> 01:33:22,262
You can't see him?

1235
01:33:24,097 --> 01:33:26,032
Now I have your attention?

1236
01:33:26,066 --> 01:33:28,068
What the hell's the matter with you?

1237
01:33:28,101 --> 01:33:30,036
Why are you doing this to me?

1238
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:32,773
Is it because of that
prick Habal? Fuck you!

1239
01:33:32,805 --> 01:33:35,375
Why is that murder so fucking significant?

1240
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:37,343
We were barely men back then?

1241
01:33:37,376 --> 01:33:38,812
Did I really start it?

1242
01:33:38,844 --> 01:33:41,680
Would murder not exist, if I
didn't kill that little shit?

1243
01:33:41,714 --> 01:33:43,483
No one else goes through this.

1244
01:33:43,515 --> 01:33:46,385
I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this!

1245
01:33:46,419 --> 01:33:48,455
Fuck god, because there isn't one!

1246
01:33:48,487 --> 01:33:52,325
If there was, she wouldn't let this happen!

1247
01:33:52,357 --> 01:33:54,360
All I see is you walking around.

1248
01:33:54,393 --> 01:33:57,798
Let me fucking die. Let me die!

1249
01:33:57,830 --> 01:33:59,198
Jack!

1250
01:33:59,232 --> 01:34:01,368
- Jack, we need help.
- What?

1251
01:34:01,401 --> 01:34:03,702
Please, God, help me.

1252
01:34:03,736 --> 01:34:09,108
Uh... um, I can't... I can't
get Andrea to the car...

1253
01:34:09,142 --> 01:34:12,845
and I am doing more damage trying
to get her there so, I need help.

1254
01:34:12,879 --> 01:34:14,848
- But...
- But what?

1255
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,150
What could you possibly be
doing that is more important?

1256
01:34:17,183 --> 01:34:18,818
Uh...

1257
01:34:18,852 --> 01:34:22,488
Stop fooling around with that asshole, Jack,
and get out there and help your daughter.

1258
01:34:22,522 --> 01:34:24,457
She's your family, for God sake.

1259
01:34:24,491 --> 01:34:26,860
I don't even know what
there is to think about.

1260
01:34:29,829 --> 01:34:32,198
Please go.

1261
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,168
Nothing, I guess.

1262
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:36,336
So get out there.

1263
01:34:36,369 --> 01:34:37,838
All right.

1264
01:34:45,311 --> 01:34:49,883
Agh... Jack...

1265
01:34:49,915 --> 01:34:53,253
One day, you'll see who I was talking to.

1266
01:35:16,843 --> 01:35:19,546
Hi.
