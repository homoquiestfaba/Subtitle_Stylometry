1
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,800
We are all Cinderella.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,100
No matter what our size.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,300
Within each one of us
there is a unique beauty and grace.

4
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,900
Finding that beauty, however, isn't easy.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,100
See, Cinderella had to first recognize
that her problem wasn't her evil stepmother.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,900
Her problem was that it was easier
to hide out, cleaning the house

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,100
than it was to go out
and find happiness.

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,400
She needed a fairy godmother

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,200
to empower her with the kind
of self confidence it takes

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,600
to reject the insecurity brought
on by unrealistic, overachieving,

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,400
airbrushed, anorexic
princess images in the media.

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,300
It took some very large
ovaries for Cinderella

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,600
to make a change to trade in her scrub brush
for a fabulous pair of dancing shoes.

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,500
But boy, was it worth it.

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm gonna be so late.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,000
No! I'm so late! Not today!

17
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,600
You okay?

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah. It's Pumpkin, my car...
Broke down. Thank you.

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,700
You named you car "Pumpkin"?

20
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,500
Yeah, she's a 65 Mustang restored.
You know kind of a...

21
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,500
pumpkin-into-a-coach...
kind of thing.

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,900
I'm at Shine. Do you work here?

23
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,400
It's just parttime. You?

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,500
Yeah. Until I get fired
for being late to a meeting!

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Thank you!

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,600
Joy, I'm late.

27
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,900
The meeting's already started.
Lori's having a stroke.

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,900
Oh, my God.

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,200
Nice of you to join us this morning.

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,700
Lory, my car died and...

31
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,100
So, Nancy, tell me. Can they sue us?

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
People can sue for anything.
It's my job to stop them.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,400
But let's be careful. The
names we throw around when we write an
article about "celebrity cougars".

34
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,500
She should be flattered.

35
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,450
Okay, people, other ideas.

36
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Fourty is the new twenty.

37
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,500
Foisty foreplay tips.

38
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,500
Feel great naked workout.

39
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,000
Nola. We were talking
about ideas for November.

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,800
Yeah.

41
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,100
Come up with something that ties Belinda
Apple's book and her November column?

42
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,800
What book?

43
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,600
For those among you who couldn't
bother to get here on time,
Nola Devlin, I'll repeat myself.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,700
Stan's and Publishing which
owns Shine and therefore me,

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,400
wants to publish a book
on Belinda Apple's columns.

46
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,200
"Apple gets to the core" sort of...
a best-of self help book.

47
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
Belinda never mentioned
a book to me.

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,600
You edit her column.
You're not her best friend.

49
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,800
I will be writing
the foreword to the book.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,700
You?

51
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,400
You have a problem with that?

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,100
No. I just thought
since I edit her column I...

53
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,600
And this matters to me
because...

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Precisely.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,700
I'll need the next column myself.

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,900
And for God sakes, clean yourself up.

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
You should totaly be writing
that intro. You know.

58
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,900
You know Belinda better than
anyone and you're an amazing writer.

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,200
Thanks.

60
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,300
It's okay. It's really
exciting about the book

61
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,200
Yeah, for Belinda.

62
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,700
Devlin!

63
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,100
Lunch? Saturday? You, me and Deb?

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
I need everything you have
on Belinda Apple.

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,800
Her life growing up in England,
education, childhood photos,

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,200
articles she wrote for
"Go Fab" magazine before.

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,800
Well, I don't have any of that.

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,700
Idea. Wait! Call her!

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Right. Or I could do a sort of
rough draft of the foreword for you and then...

70
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sure your knickers are in a knot
about this but look at you.

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,600
No offense but you're
sugar-encrusted nobody.

72
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,100
Do you really think Stanson

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,400
wants you to write the foreword
to a book by its biggest star?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No.

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,700
No. "No" is right.

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,100
Then get me what I need.

76
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,200
Go!

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,600
Sorry to hear about your car.

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,500
That's okay.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,400
But uh, Chip, the new computer guy
is working today and he lives

80
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
near you so he could give you
a ride home if you want.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,700
Chip, like "computer chip"?

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Anyway, shall I get him to meet you
in the parking lot at six?

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,600
Sure. Yes. Thank you.
That would be great.

84
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,800
- Okay
- Okay

85
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,100
Oh, yeah. It's all limo
rides for you, isn't it?

86
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,800
Me, I get to take a ride home
with the geek squad.

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,500
He is computer chip? Oh!

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,700
Hey, Hi!

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,400
You probably don't recognize me
standing upright but this
really is my better side.

90
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm Nola Devlin. You are computer chip, right?

91
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,400
Is that a joke?

92
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,100
Apparently not a very good one.
Thank you for waiting for me.

93
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,000
Joy told me you live
near me on the north-end

94
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,000
so I really appreciate...
the ride.

95
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,800
You did offer to give a ride, didn't you?

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,700
Well, I'd be happy to give you a ride.

97
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,100
Okay

98
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,000
You edit Belinda Apple's column.

99
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,800
So. Did you end up getting fired?

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
No, not yet. But I am sure
that that's in the works.

102
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Bad day?

103
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,000
When I was in the 6th grade a boy
asked me to a Halloween party.

104
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I went as a cheeseburger because
that's the only contume that fit.

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,700
Well. When I got there I found out
that you were supposed to be

106
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
dressed as what you want
to be when you grew up.

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,800
Yeah. Today was worse.
I don't wanna talk about it.

108
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,800
And my car, the one that died...

109
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
My dad bought me that car
for my 16th birthday.

110
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,600
You know, I mean...
That cat took me to college.

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,000
I was to the Jersey Shore in that car.
That cat took me to
Boston to see Cold Play.

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,400
I made out with Ronnie Spilman in that car.
That car defines me.

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Defined you. Past tense.

114
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Hey, look. You know, change is good.

115
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,800
Old car dies.
New car could be better.

116
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,600
What about a... Porsche.

117
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
That is my back-up fantasy car.

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
Back-up fantasy?

119
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, my fantasy-fantasy car is a
powder-blue 55 thunderbird.

120
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,100
I mean, if I had to break the bank,
that would be my sledgehammer.

121
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,100
Now you're talking.

122
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,400
Now I'm dellucinating.
Can't afford that car on my salary.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,400
Don't let work get in the way of your dream.
I speak from my experience.

124
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,000
I am all about the dream and
so not about the job.

125
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,900
Girls like me don't drive cars like that.

126
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,900
Says who?

127
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,000
My low self-esteem.

128
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,100
Well, maybe it's time for you to grow
up, take charge of your life and be all
that you can be.

129
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,200
Oh, okay.

130
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,700
It's the advice my father gives me.

131
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
But hey, listen, if the
whole dream doesn't work for you,

132
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,600
you can always do as he tells me
and demand change.

133
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,600
This one. Right here.

134
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,200
Right there?

135
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,100
Yeah.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,100
Thank you for the ride.
It was very nice of you.

137
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,900
Can I offer you anything for gas?

138
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,300
No. I'm cool.

139
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,200
All right.

140
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,000
It's probably none of my business but...

141
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,300
I think your father is wrong. I don't
think you can demand change from people.

142
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,800
I think you have to... inspire it.
You know?

143
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,500
Yeah.

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
All right. Let's see what we got. You ready?

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,500
Dear Belinda.
This is my life. Or non-life.

146
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,800
I am a plus-size woman
in her thirties

147
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,300
with a cat in a pastel
colored apartment.

148
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,400
Could I be any more the stereotype?

149
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm under-appreciated at work.

150
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,800
And the only physical contact I
get is from my cat.

151
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,400
Am I hopeless? Can I get out of this rut?
Or should I just buy another cat?

152
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,700
Signed "Lifeless in Los Angeles".

153
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,200
All right, Belinda. What do you got?

154
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,500
Dear Lifeless,

155
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Your cat must be tired of the pity-party
you've been throwing yourself everyday.

156
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,800
Maybe if you didn't put yourself down
so much you wouldn't be so pathetic.

157
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,300
You want a life? Get one.

158
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:21,200
Grant yourself a wish to change. Then
stop complaining and do something.

159
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,300
Yeah, I did something.

160
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,800
What?

161
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,400
Hi, Lory.

162
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,200
Lory,

163
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,100
you know how you said Shine
needs to distinguish itself

164
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
by adding an advice columnist
to address issues facing women today?

165
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,400
I said I wanted a columnist
to answer all the dimwits

166
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,400
who ask embarasing questions
about their sex lifes.

167
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,300
Well, I answered your sample questions

168
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,100
for the advice columnist in what
I believe is a biting and edgy way.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, you're serious.

170
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,100
I wanna write...

171
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,100
So, write.

172
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,000
...here. Lory, I wanna write here.

173
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,100
Listen, I've been an assistant editor for
over a year. And before I came to Shine I wrote

174
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,100
articles for my college paper.
Good stuff. I can do this.

175
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,800
It's good to dream big.

176
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,400
Thank you.

177
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,900
Being a columnist is a very important,
very public position.

178
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,200
It's the face of
the magazine.

179
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,300
Right.

180
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,500
You're not a face.

181
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,300
You are just a big girl
with a big dream.

182
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,600
Nice try, though.

183
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,900
She wants a face.
I'll give her a face.

184
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,300
Bing!

185
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm hot.

186
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,300
Hi, Lory.

187
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,500
What's wrong with Belinda?

188
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
What do you mean?

189
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,600
I can't get her on the phone
to discuss the book.

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,300
If she doesn't call me back I'm
going to have to fly to London tomorrow.

191
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,000
Is that really necessary?

192
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,000
This book is a huge deal. It will launch
a new division for the company.

193
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,100
They're dumping a load of
money into promoting it.

194
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,000
Book tour, TV, Oprah...
Belinda will be everywhere.

195
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,100
In person?

196
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,500
That's why they call them
"personal appearences".

197
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,700
I'm gonna try to conference her in.
Hold on.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No! Wait!

199
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,300
What's that?

200
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,200
Nothing.

201
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,100
Hello!

202
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,000
Belinda... Belinda, finally.
Hi. It's Lory and Nola.

203
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Hello, Lory. Hello Nola.
I'm actually just headed...

204
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,060
At two in the morning?

205
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
Yes... in. Just headed in.

206
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,900
- Nola?
- Yeah!

207
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,400
Do you wanna tell her
about our promotional plans?

208
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,800
Is this about the book?

209
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,200
Yes, it is, actually, Belinda.
They want you to come out here.

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,900
Well, that's impossible.
I'm in London.

211
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
So, it'a a good thing we have planes.

212
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Yes, isn't it?
You know... I don't think I can make it.

213
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,700
You don't even know when it is.

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
Oh, when is it?

215
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,200
End of October.

216
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,800
Definitely can't.

217
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, she's going to... Africa.

218
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,900
How do you know?

219
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:52,400
Yes! Africa! Nola and I have been planning
this trip for ages. It's for a charity...

220
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,100
for children.

221
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,600
Did I mention this is launching
a whole new book division?

222
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,500
Goodness! Gracious me! It's two o'clock
in the morning here. I've got to go to bed.

223
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,800
You two work it out.
I'll talk to you later. Bye!

224
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,200
Nola, are you still there?

225
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,300
Yeah, hey.

226
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,800
Do you think I give a rat's ass about
her vacation plans?

227
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,100
You better make sure
she's here by oktober 30th.

228
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,400
Or?

229
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,500
Or you're fired. You recommended her.
I don't care if she's boosted circulation 50%.

230
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,100
If she blows this for me I will
destroy her... and you.

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,700
Have a good night!

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm screwed.

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,600
Could we get that table by the window?
That's our favourite spot.

234
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,300
Oh, I'm really sorry.
That table's reserved.

235
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,400
Oh, really! I didn't know that
you could reserve tables.

236
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,900
Well, you can now.
We're under new management.

237
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,700
Chester... is it?

238
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,500
Well, this is Nola Devlin.
She edits Belinda Apple's column

239
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,500
which I'm sure everyone
in America has read.

240
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,600
It's just that, you know, the first saturday
of every month we sit at that table.

241
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,500
And this saturday it's reserved.

242
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,200
Oh, God, here we go.

243
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,000
You wouldn't, by any chance,
not be giving us that table

244
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,700
because we are
on the zaftig side. Would you?

245
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,200
I don't know what you mean.

246
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,400
Because we're fat.

247
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
Would you like to order?

248
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes. We'd like the table by the window.

249
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,300
Ladies, if you're not happy with the
service here there are a number
of other restaurants is Princeton.

250
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Zaftig? What are we? Russian peasant women?

251
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,600
This is fat discrimination.

252
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,200
Sorry!

253
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,100
I wish I had a magic wand so
I could instantly make us thin.

254
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,300
Like Cinderella. Except instead of a
ball gown we've got hip bones and a waist.

255
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,900
Sorry, my magic wand
is in the repair shop.

256
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,200
Maybe it's time
for a fairy godmother.

257
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,800
Don't do it. Don't pull her out.

258
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,800
Belinda Apple represents the woman
I would be if I could...

259
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,000
reclaim my power and
get out of my own way.

260
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
We all need to do that.

261
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,100
If Belinda is so great
at giving advice

262
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,700
then how come Nola works
for her and she's still such a mess?

263
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,000
Hey!

264
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,600
Honey, you're a fantastic writer
but you're editing someone else's work.

265
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,900
You're a wonderful woman but
there are no men in your life.

266
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,200
And that pizza delivery guy...
not Prince Charming.

267
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,900
Come on now, listen.

268
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,500
Dear fabulous Belinda,

269
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,400
I'm tired of being overweight,
bla bla bla,

270
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,000
I've dieted my whole life,
and now I'm almost 250 pounds.

271
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,400
What should I do?

272
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,400
Two fifty! Wow! She should
stop weighting herself.

273
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,700
Dear sexy underneath it all.

274
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,600
I will let you in on my deepest,
darkest secret.

275
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,000
I used to be desperately overweight.
Finally I couldn't stand it any more.

276
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,300
I had to take control of my life.
Was it hard? Yes. How did I do it?

277
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,600
By reclaiming my power,
getting out of my own way,

278
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,200
by finding a symbol to remind myself
of the person I knew I was inside

279
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,600
and by being honest
with myself.

280
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
There's no way that woman was ever fat.

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,100
Let's say we follow
Belindas's example and just do it.

282
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,200
No, I can't, you guys. I have
way too much on my plate right now.

283
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,100
You're just scared of change.

284
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,200
I like my life. I have a good job,
a husband who loves me

285
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
with whom I have sex once a month.
Why should I change?

286
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,300
But, are you happy?

287
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,599
I mean, completely, utterly,
every moment happy.

288
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm not. I mean... Paul loves me
but I don't love me.

289
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Every spring we take the kids
to Paul's parents in Seattle.

290
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,100
Kids want to go some place warm
but we don't because they know

291
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,900
I would never step foot
on a beach on a bathing suit.

292
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,300
I just wanna be with my family
doing normal family things.

293
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,700
Oh, come on. Don't cry.

294
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,700
Let's do it. Let's do
what Belinda said

295
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,500
and let's become the women
we know we are inside.

296
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,100
You really believe in her, don't you?

297
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,900
Don't you?

298
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,700
Don't you want the person inside
of you to finally emerge?

299
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,700
That's a complicated question.

300
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,800
We've all been on diet.

301
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,100
But this time we'll do it together.

302
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,100
We're there for one another.
Totally honest and no one's off the hook.

303
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,800
On one condition.

304
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,400
In four months we go back
to the Willoughbe Cafe,

305
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,500
we get that table
by the window and

306
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,800
we shame Chester until
he is groveling at our feet.

307
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,700
Done.

308
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,200
One, we meet September 5th
to humilliate Chester.

309
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,200
Supporting each other no matter
where and no matter what.

310
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,800
We can work out together
every other day.

311
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,200
To start.

312
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,000
Workout and diet. No secret stashes.
Nola, you know what I'm talking about.

313
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,800
And we need our symbols to remind us
of who we're gonna be.

314
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,700
Mine is red. When I was thin,
I wore color. Now I just...

315
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,700
well, I wear Eileen Fischer versions of a burka.

316
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:51,200
Nancy wants bold proud red and I...
wanna wear bikini on the beach.

317
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,200
Nola?

318
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,400
I don't know. Can I think about it?

319
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:00,800
All right. Nola's goal TBD.
We have weekly weigh-ins with our weight-loss pact.

320
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,300
Can we call it something else?

321
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:09,700
Well, since Belinda is our fairy godmother
how about "the Cinderella pact"?

322
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,900
A toast! To change.

323
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,900
To friendship.

324
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,400
To the Cinderella pact.

325
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,600
Belinda would be so proud of it.

326
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,700
I hope so. I really do.

327
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
I can't go in there.

328
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,900
"Can't" is not part
of our vocabulary, okay?

329
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,000
Together we have strength.

330
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,000
We give each other confidence.

331
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,100
Honey, listen, nobody said
this was gonna be easy, right? We can...

332
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
We should hire a personal trainer.
Work out on our own terms.

333
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,200
Great idea! What do you think of that?

334
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,200
Okay.

335
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,600
Nola? Hey, you work out here too?

336
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,300
No.

337
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,100
No, because we already
worked out actually.

338
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,800
It was really intense.
We had a good one, right?

339
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,100
This is my friend Nancy and
this is my friend Deb.

340
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,600
This is Chip. He gave a ride
when Punpkin died.

341
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Really!

342
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,900
I'm gonna go in. It was nice
meeting you, guys. Good to see you.

343
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah!

344
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Oh, my God. I'm such a looser.

345
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,900
He is adorable!

346
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,900
Deb, don't get any ideas.
He is too adorable for me.

347
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,100
Oh, come on. He would be lucky
to have you, wouldn't he?

348
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,000
Absolutely.

349
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,100
Cinderella pact.

350
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,800
Well, that was exhausting.
I felt the burn.

351
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,400
Me too. I think I pulled
something back there.

352
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,500
Oh, great first day, ladies.

353
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,700
Keep it coming.
Let's go. Punch.

354
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,500
Final stretch, Deb.
How you doing?

355
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,100
Hangin' in.

356
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,400
All right.

357
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
Push it. Let's go.

358
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,900
Keep it tight,
keep it tight.

359
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Okay, 45 seconds.

360
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Come on, Deb.
Let's go!

361
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,500
Oh, my God!
What do you guys eat for breakfast?

362
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,300
Oh, Deb, they're waiting!
Let's go Deb!

363
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,100
Go, Deb!

364
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,900
Yeah!

365
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,800
That's it.
That's my goal.

366
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,100
Oh, Nola, it's...

367
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,200
Perfect.

368
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,100
Cincerella would be proud.

369
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,500
Hello!

370
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,300
Belinda, it's Charlotte,
your agent,

371
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,400
who you never call back.

372
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,800
Hi, Charlotte.
How are you, darling?

373
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm sorry to call you
so late. But we really need

374
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,300
to talk about this book.

375
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,700
I've been getting calls from
a Lory Digrigio at Stanson.

376
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,900
Over twenty, to be exact.

377
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,400
She really needs to
schedule personal appearences

378
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,500
and a promotional tour
to launch this book.

379
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,600
It's part of your contract.
They really need some dates.

380
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,000
Do you know what?
I will check my calendar

381
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,500
and I will get back to you
with many options, okay?

382
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,700
No, no, Belinda.
It would be really helpful

383
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,600
if we could do this right now
while I got you on the phone...

384
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,900
This is... Charlotte, I have to call
you back. It's a terrible line! Bye! Bad line!

385
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,800
Oh! No!

386
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,600
Mr. Tuchman, everything's under
control. I just burned my dinner again.

387
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,100
Hi!

388
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,400
What happened?

389
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,600
I'm sorry. I set off the smoke alarm
again. It happens all the time.

390
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,200
Don't worry about a thing. There.

391
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,500
What's up?

392
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
I brought over something
I want you to watch.

393
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,400
Okay.

394
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,800
Gastric bypass.
Miracle answer or helpful tool.

395
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,500
Once you get past the black stools
and the possible death thing

396
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,600
it's actually pretty okay.

397
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,100
Deb, you can't be serious
about having this surgery.

398
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,000
Mr. Tuchman, everything's
under control. See? It stopped.

399
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,600
Don't hang up. It's Chip.

400
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,600
Chip? How did you get this number?

401
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,700
The company directory.

402
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,600
Oh, did I leave something
in your track?

403
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,800
No, I was actually
in your neighbourhood

404
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,100
and was wandering if
you wanna meet for a drink.

405
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,600
Meet for a drink?
Meet tonight?

406
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,800
Yes! Yes!

407
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,900
Could you hold on
for a second, please?

408
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,000
I wanna talk to you
about this surgery.

409
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm not having it tomorrow.
Are you nuts?

410
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,100
Stomach surgery DVD or
amazingly hunky guy?

411
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,300
All right. I got it.

412
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,200
Yeah, I think I could
probably make it.

413
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,400
Where are you?

414
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,100
Brown's? In half hour?

415
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,300
Tell him you'll be there.

416
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,500
Half hour. I'll be there.

417
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,800
All right. Bye.

418
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,600
Oh, my God.

419
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,500
Don't just stand there. Let's get you dressed.
Come on.

420
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,900
Half an hour! What am I?
Wonder Woman? Look at me!

421
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,800
But you've got four hands!
Come on!

422
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,200
Nola...

423
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,200
Hi!

424
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,500
I kind of feel really overdressed

425
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,300
Excuse me. The lady will have...

426
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,500
A white wine spritzer.

427
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,100
Thank you.
Right over here.

428
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,600
Whoa. It is a good thing I changed.
I was gonna wear the exact same outfit.

429
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,900
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

430
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,400
So, did you buy a new car yet?

431
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,500
I rented one. A Volvo.

432
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,400
- Very safe choice.
- Yeah.

433
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,200
But safe is not all it's cracked up to be.
Sometimes you need to step

434
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,700
outside your confort zone
and take risks to be successful.

435
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,500
Okay.

436
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Another one-sided conversation I've been
having with my father for years.

437
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,500
So, what's his definition of success?

438
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,100
Someone who is hard-working,
responsible and focused.

439
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,200
So, you're lazy, reckless and unfocused?

440
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,500
That's the old me.
Apparently I was avoiding success.

441
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,400
It sounds to me like you might've
been avoiding failure.

442
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,000
Not a bad life strategy, you know.
You never try, you never fail.

443
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,700
Probably. It's a very
astute observation.

444
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,700
Yes, well...

445
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,500
I'm very insightful and intuitive.
It's a gift and a curse.

446
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,200
Really?

447
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,100
Yeah.

448
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,600
What am I thinking right now?

449
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,600
You're thinking that you
don't wanna tell me

450
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,800
all your secrets 'cause it'll
make you seem vulnerable.

451
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
You're right.

452
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Never talk about my personal life.

453
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,100
All right. I'm gonna do
something for you here, okay?

454
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm gonna tell you one
embarasing thing about me

455
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,700
so that we can be equally
vulnerable.

456
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,400
That's only fair.

457
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,200
I'm a criminal. I downloaded a movie
ilegally off the Internet

458
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,500
before it came out on DVD.

459
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,600
So, you're in the run
from the law.

460
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,200
Yes, you're aiding
and abetting a criminal.

461
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,800
Damn.

462
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,600
What?

463
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,600
That woman's just walked out
of the ladies' room.

464
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,900
She's sort of an old girlfriend.
Things ended badly.

465
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:54,700
Ended badly like
"she went to yoga and never came back" badly
or "she boiled your pet rabbit" badly.

466
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
Go with me on this.

467
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,400
Well, hello.
I thought you died.

468
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,600
Not dead. Just travelling,
busy with work and...

469
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,200
This is my girlfriend, Nola.

470
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,900
Nola?

471
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,600
Nola... Devlin. Hi!
I'm his girlfriend.

472
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,800
You are beyond pathetic.

473
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,600
You stopped calling me
because you're dating this fat lady?

474
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,100
No, I stopped calling you
because we broke up six months ago.

475
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,300
We're over.

476
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,000
We're not over... until she sings.

477
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,200
You know what?

478
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,200
Hey!

479
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,500
Classy, Ange. Thanks.

480
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,500
Nola, wait up!

481
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,400
No, no, no!

482
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,500
I'm so sorry.
Angie is a total psyco. I...

483
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,000
Please, can I at least walk you home?

484
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,800
No, obviously I can take care of myself.

485
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,300
What if I just walk six steps behind you?
Then if I get mugged you can step in and save me.

486
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm an idiot, okay? I got caught off-guard.
I had no idea that she'd be there.

487
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,200
I never should've used you
like that. I'm sorry.

488
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
You know, you should be sorry.

489
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
Don't you get it?

490
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,300
Girls like me are easy targets for
girls like that, you know?

491
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,900
You should never have put me
in that position.

492
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,000
It was humiliating for me. And
believe me, my life is humiliating enough.

493
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,000
You have every right to be angry.
But I would never want to humiliate you.

494
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,200
I just wanna know one thing!
One thing! Why did you call me tonight?

495
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,700
To meet for a drink.

496
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,700
No. You could have called
a hundred girls just like that.

497
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,000
Why did you called ME?

498
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,300
I don't know. I...
I feel confortable with you.

499
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,300
I thought we could be friends.

500
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,500
Wow. You have a really interesting way
of making new friends, you know?

501
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,400
I screwed up. Come on.
You've never done something stupid you regret?

502
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,300
Never.

503
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,400
Do I really need to remind you of the
cheeseburger costume debacle?

504
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,200
I'm really truly sorry about tonight.

505
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,400
No, it's okay.

506
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,400
Friends?

507
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Sure. Friends.

508
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,800
Okay.

509
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,200
So, what are your saturdays like?

510
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,200
Oh, well. Saturdays I... uh...
I train with Oscar de la Hoya. Why?

511
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Well, I wanted the chance to thank you
for protecting me against Angie.

512
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm working in a new project
in L.A. for six weeks.

513
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
June 13th. Pick you up at noon?

514
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,600
Sure. Yeah. Noon.

515
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,800
- Six weeks?
- Six weeks.

516
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,500
- Bye
- Bye

517
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:53,200
Who am I kidding?
Hot, sexy guy does not want ordinary zaftig me.

518
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,800
He wants someone like you.

519
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,500
Hey, girls, check this out.

520
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,000
These jeans that you see me
wearing today?

521
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,400
Found them in the back of my closet.

522
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,500
Last time I wore them I was 18.
I tried them out and they fit!

523
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,700
When's your date with chip?

524
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,500
We... we're friends. It's not a date.

525
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,900
Oh, but it could be.

526
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,800
Yeah. He's way out of my league.

527
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,200
Why? Because you're smart and
you're funny, and...

528
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
Hello! You gonna help me out here?

529
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,960
The lap-band is an inflatable
device placed around the stomach

530
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,200
creating a small pouch.
They don't remove any

531
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,900
of the digestive system
and it's easy to reverse.

532
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,800
This is way better for me
than a gastric...

533
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,800
Thank you.

534
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,600
than a gastric bypass.

535
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,800
Well, at least they're not going
to reroute your intestines.

536
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,000
However the procedure is not
without risks. One in 2500 patients die?

537
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:52,800
I already have high blood pressure.
I'm at risk for diabetes and heart desease.

538
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,300
It's been almost a month since we
started the pact.

539
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,700
And you and Nola have lost weight.

540
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,600
I gained.

541
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,000
I want... need this.

542
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,400
Of course, you do.
And we're your best friends.

543
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,800
We're here for you no matter what.

544
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Good.

545
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,500
Cause I already have it scheduled
and you guys better be there.

546
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,800
I got your message. What's going on?

547
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,200
Richard Stanson called.

548
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,200
He wants to launch
the book at September.

549
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,400
September?
What happened to late October?

550
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,700
They want the book out before fall.

551
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,200
And it gets better.

552
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,200
Shine is hosting a launch party
for Belinda September 5th

553
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,600
and she's not even
returning my e-mails

554
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,900
I talked to the editor at "Go Fab" magazine
and she never ever worked there.

555
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,000
This could be like Jayson Blair and
the New Times all over again.

556
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,600
You're overreading. I doubt that...

557
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,900
What the hell is going on?

558
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,800
It's like she doesn't even exist.

559
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,800
She exists!

560
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,200
You talked to her on the telephone.
She is very shy and the book tour...

561
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,600
I mean, she hates
doing personal appearences.

562
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,500
I don't care.

563
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,800
Belinda's contract specifically
includes promotional tie-ins.

564
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,800
If she doesn't understand that
then she'll have plenty of time

565
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,600
to reread the contract
she's violated

566
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,400
in a little retreat called
the Beacon Correctional Facility.

567
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,900
Now find her.

568
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,700
Go.

569
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
I'm thinking of using

570
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,400
Don't do it. Whatever happened
that'll be okay, eventually.

571
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,500
I'm not so sure about that.

572
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,500
What's wrong?

573
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,600
Can I ask you a legal hypothetical?

574
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,300
All right. Let's say there is
a person. A singer.

575
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,200
What kind of singer?

576
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,400
I don't know. A country singer.

577
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,300
I like country.

578
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,300
Oh, okay, good. So...
Let's say this country singer

579
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,300
she's supposed to do a concert
but she doesn't show up.

580
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,200
I'm assuming that concert people
would probably sue her but

581
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,400
what if she doesn't have any money?
Does she go to jail?

582
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,400
What, like debtor's prison?

583
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,500
Yeah.

584
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,100
Yeah. If Dickens were still alive.

585
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,100
These days they'd figure out
something else. She'd do
another concert for free.

586
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,300
Wow. What's going on?

587
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:06,200
Nothing. I just...
I'm doing research for Belinda.

588
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,000
Right. No wonder you're eating.

589
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,199
What does that suppose to mean?

590
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,900
You do all the work,
she takes the credit.

591
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,000
Not true.

592
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,800
Oh, come on. You've always been
the one to take the broken cookie.

593
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,400
Because you don't think you deserve
the good one. It's like you well...

594
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,800
you stand in the shadows
while other people shine.

595
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I get it. It's easier to sabotage
yourself stuffing your face

596
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,199
than it is to just put yourself
out there and risk failure.

597
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,000
You know, broken or whole
a cookie never rejects you.

598
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,400
When you're ready you'll stand up.
You'll take centre stage.

599
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,000
But until then you need to
find confort without food.

600
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,600
Dear desperate in Duluth,
do not give up on yourself.

601
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,000
You are worth a million times more
than that cheating husband of yours.

602
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,500
Your life isn't over because he is gone.

603
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,900
It is just beginning
because you are free.

604
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,500
Free from the lying,
the deceit, the pain.

605
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,700
You, my friend,
can be anything you want now.

606
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:23,800
On my honour I will try to do my best
to love my country and God

607
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,800
and obbey all the rules
set out in the handbook.

608
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,200
I always feel better after I pray.

609
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,600
That was the "Brownie Promise".

610
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,900
It's still sacred and I have
the badges to prove it.

611
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,300
I think the valium is working.

612
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Honey they're going to
come get you soon.

613
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,600
Thanks for being here, guys.
It means a lot.

614
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,100
Where else would we be?

615
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,800
Paul should be here.

616
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,400
You know what?
You're changing. You know?

617
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,300
And some people
are afraid of change.

618
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,600
What's Paul think?
I'll lose a few pounds and

619
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,500
George Clooney'll want to take me
and the kids to Italy to ride Vespas?

620
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,600
Seriously no, right?

621
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:20,400
Listen you can't let Paul dictate what you want.
You have to stand for yourself.

622
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,500
I am so going to do that,

623
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,900
once my stomach has been reduced
to the size of a dill pickle.

624
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,700
I can't believe Paul's not here. Honestly,
I mean, he's just... He's clueless.

625
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,100
So are a lot of men.

626
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,200
Ron's a man. He's not.

627
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah. But Ron's different.

628
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,900
Mm-mm. You're different.
You stand up for yourself.

629
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,300
Not always.

630
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,800
Yeah. Right.

631
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,400
Okay. I'm gonna admit something here.

632
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,900
I think that...
Belinda Apple may be right.

633
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,600
I kinda feel like our Cinderella pact is working.

634
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,200
You know that I wasn't always like this.
I mean. I used to have a waist and...

635
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,800
Then I started working at Stanson and
there wasn't a day that Ted Fines

636
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,500
wouldn't stare at my chest or...

637
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,600
accidentaly grab my ass.

638
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,500
I was like the ultimate doormat

639
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,000
You never told me that.

640
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,500
That's embarrassing.

641
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,800
Here I am representing employees
against sexual harassment

642
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,900
while I'm taking it myself.

643
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,300
So you put on weight.

644
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,500
Well, the bigger I got
the less Ted hassled me.

645
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,600
You know, I've lost 21 pounds
and I should be happy.

646
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,100
But what if I keep loosing weight
and the harassment starts again?

647
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,300
It won't. You won't let it.

648
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,400
Am I thinner?

649
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,100
Definitely!

650
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,100
Excellent.

651
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,400
I snagged this from
the fashion closet upstairs.

652
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,200
Very nice.
It'll look great with you eyes.

653
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
It's not for me.
It's for you date... with Chip.

654
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,700
Again, not a date.
A friend thing.

655
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,200
Whatever. You can still look nice.
Your clothes are swimming on you now

656
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,100
but you boobs, they still look great.
And this tent look is getting old.

657
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,000
My boobs look great?

658
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,800
Totally. Chip will be very impressed.
You know, in a friendly way.

659
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Hi!

660
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,000
Hey, you ready?
I have a surprise.

661
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,400
My purse, my keys...

662
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,500
What?

663
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,400
You look different.

664
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,600
Good different
or bad different.

665
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,100
Definitely...
definitely good different.

666
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,800
Okay, let's see this surprise.

667
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,700
Yeah, come on.

668
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,100
Right over here.

669
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Oh, my god!

670
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,600
Yeah, well I do a lot of work
for the dealersship

671
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,400
so they said we could
take it for a test drive.

672
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,700
You brought this for me to ride?

673
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,800
Yeah. I wanted to apologize...
again.

674
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,000
You could've bought me a houseplant.

675
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,400
Come on. Let's take
this baby for a ride.

676
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,400
I can't

677
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,800
Why not?

678
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,400
She's so beautiful... I...
I can't drive this car.

679
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,200
Well, there is some element of risk
in living your dreams.

680
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,200
Hold on.

681
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,500
You're no longer Volvo-safe.
You are sports car fearless.

682
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,100
Thank you

683
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,000
Yes! There's something just
so wrong about ketchup on a hot dog.

684
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,500
You sure you don't want anything?

685
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,800
No, I'm good. It's...

686
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,800
I'm kind of doing this Cinderella
pact with my friends.

687
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,100
We're trying to eat healthy,
lose a little weight.

688
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,100
Well, you look great.

689
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,700
Oh, thank you.

690
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,200
Okay. That makes it official.
This is the most fun I've ever had

691
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,500
without trans-fats being involved.

692
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,900
Fast cars, compliments,
what could be better?

693
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah, you can't beat fast cars for fun

694
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,800
and I've definitely had my fill in
my danger-seeking irresponsible youth.

695
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Oh!

696
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,000
What?

697
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,200
No, nothing.

698
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,500
All right. It's just...
You have a relationship

699
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,300
with a Porsche dealership, right?
You've had a lot of fast cars.

700
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,800
And not that it's not a
wonderful profession but

701
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,500
I didn't realize you could make
so much money fixing people's computers.

702
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,800
My... uh... family has money, not me,

703
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,200
You know, and I've been slacking
for a few years but I'm trying to change.

704
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,200
Oh, yeah. How's that working out for you?

705
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,400
Well, you know, one step forward,
two steps back.

706
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,000
Croquet!

707
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,800
You play?

708
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh, no, not anymore. That was part of
my danger-seeking irresponsible youth.

709
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,100
I don't just play. I uh... I dominate.

710
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Really?

711
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,400
Mm-mm

712
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,200
Mm

713
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,900
Well, I guess we're uh...
going to have to see about that.

714
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,800
It's the last point in the
match and Nola appears to be
crumbling under the pressure.

715
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,700
Stop stalling!

716
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,800
Losing to a girl would be
humiliating for the cool guy.

717
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,200
She should remember that he
found her her back-up fantasy car.

718
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,600
True. He should know

719
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,000
that if she let's him win it's only
cause she took pity on him.

720
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,800
What is that?

721
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,600
What?

722
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,200
No!

723
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,400
Yes! He wins!

724
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,100
- No!
- Yes! I did!

725
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,100
- You cheated!
- No, I did not.

726
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,500
- He cheated!
- No.

727
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,500
- You guys saw that!
- I did not.

728
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,700
Cheat!

729
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,600
- Thank you, guys.
- Thanks, guys.

730
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,200
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

731
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,600
- So...
- So...

732
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,000
What's it like working for Belinda Apple?

733
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,700
Uh... exciting, frustrating.

734
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,100
Sometimes I feel like
she's taken over my life.

735
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,600
Mmm, sounds demanding.

736
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,000
More like all-consuming.

737
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,100
Do you ever feel like you're uh...
living in Belinda's shadow?

738
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,600
You know, like no one
would ever take you seriously

739
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,600
if she weren't
the name ahead of yours.

740
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,500
Yeah, all the time.

741
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
How'd you know?

742
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,100
Well, you have Belinda.
I have my father.

743
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
We're both treading water
at the same end of the pool.

744
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,000
Except I don't know how to swim.

745
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah, I found people will
generally tell who they are

746
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,800
the first three minutes you know them.
You just have to listen.

747
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,900
Well, I don't think Angie told me
she was a complete nutjob
when we first met.

748
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,800
Sometimes you have to close you eyes
and listen between the lines.

749
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,700
Um, here.

750
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,700
Oh, thank you.

751
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,000
Thanks. So, thank you for
a wonderful, wonderful day.

752
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,900
No, thank you.

753
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,500
Hey, so, listen. I'm going
out of town againg for work

754
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,600
but maybe when I get back
we can get together. Dinner?

755
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,200
Oh, god. No need. You know,
you're totally forgiven

756
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,400
for Angie's behaviour.
You're off the hook.

757
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,500
Oh, this next date will have
nothing to do with Angie.

758
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,400
Date?

759
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,100
August 31st?

760
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,800
Oh, wow. You really like to plan
in advance, don't you?

761
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,300
What are you doing Thanksgiving
two years from now?

762
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
All right. Well...

763
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,600
Hey, you bowl?

764
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,600
No.

765
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,400
Good. We'll go bowling.

766
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,300
That way I can reclaim
my manhood. You in?

767
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,800
Sure.

768
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,700
All right.

769
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,800
Now Corporate has decided they want
elinda to write the intro to the book.

770
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,800
Call her in Botswana
or wherever the hell she is.

771
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,800
I need it next week.

772
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,500
I don't think Belinda wants
to be part of the book's publication

773
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,100
Excuse me?

774
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,000
No, it's just she's only been writing
for the magazine seven months.

775
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,400
Maybe she thinks it's too early.

776
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,000
The publishing world is in serious trouble.
Magazines are folding every day.

777
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,600
Shine was on line-support before
Belinda started her column.

778
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,200
Ad-revs are up and Mr. Stanson likes her.

779
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,900
If she doesn't show up to support the book
at the launch party he will be furious.

780
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,000
He could kill the magazine. You got it?

781
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,900
Go.

782
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,400
Hi. You're obviously the food lady.
Can I leave these with you?

783
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,400
Why am I obviously the food lady?
Is it because I'm not size two? Hm?

784
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,400
All right, let me tell you something, Sherlock.
Real women, they don't look like the women

785
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,200
you see on TV or magazine covers, okay?
So ho ahead. You tell me.

786
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,100
Why must I obviously be the food lady?

787
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,400
Because your... uh...
your desk says you are.

788
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,800
Right. Sorry.

789
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,800
All right. I'm going to head home
a little early tonight, everybody.
I kind of...

790
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, 'cause, you know, the last ride
to Crazytown leaves, and I got shotgun.

791
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,100
Oh! Oh, my god!

792
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,300
What?

793
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,900
The size 18 is too big!

794
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,300
Oh! Okay, wait. Here, I'm going to...

795
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,700
bring you some other sizes.
Maybe these will fit.

796
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,200
Thanks.

797
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,100
Okay.

798
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,200
Why can't Paul be excited about this?

799
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,700
The more weight I lose,
the angrier he gets.

800
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,700
I begged him to go to counselling,
but he refused.

801
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,200
That's no right, Deb.

802
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,200
What do you think Belinda would
tell me to do?

803
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,400
Well, I think she'd say that you
deserve to be loved unconditionaly,

804
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,800
and if you're not
you should consider your options.

805
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,600
I know, right? It's a 14.

806
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,600
You know the last time I was a size 14?
High school.

807
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,200
Oh, my god. Deb, you're so thin.

808
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,200
Oh, I'm not that thin.

809
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
Oh, I've lost 37 pounds.

810
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,800
37 pounds? Oh, my god. I'm just...
I'm so proud of you.

811
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,600
Oh, I couldn't have done it without you
and Nancy and Belinda.

812
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,800
The Cinderella Pact rocks.

813
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,000
Now we need to find you something
fantastic to wear on your date.

814
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,800
No, no, no. I'm good.

815
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,460
I've got something in the back
of my closet. I can pull it out...

816
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,700
Okay, your brain needs
to catch up with your body.

817
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah, you need some
clothes that actually fit you.

818
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,300
All right. We are not
back-of-closet girls anymore.

819
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,500
Deb, I...

820
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,800
You need a new dress.
Good. Here, try.

821
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Go.

822
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,700
You know what? Why...

823
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,700
Eh, eh, eh.
Do it for me. Go.

824
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,900
I don't need...

825
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,900
I don't want to hear it,
I want to see it.

826
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:54,200
Dear stuck in a rut. A date is
nothing to freak out over.

827
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:01,000
Wear something that says
"I am confident and
prepared for anything"

828
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,400
Makeup should enhance, not camouflage
your own unique qualities.

829
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,700
And most importantly, be yourself.

830
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,300
You don't want to be with anyone
who doesn't see the real you.

831
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
- Hey.
- Hi.

832
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,800
Hi. Come on in.

833
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,000
Hey, you look great.
I mean, you know, not that, you know,

834
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,200
you didn't look great before,
but you were... more...

835
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,100
more...

836
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,500
No, I...

837
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,800
There's not really a graceful way
out of this, is there?

838
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,500
This is uncharted territory.
Come on. Um, can I...

839
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,800
offer you something to drink?

840
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,400
I have, uh, diet root beer,
diet cola, diet ice tea, wine...

841
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,300
- I'll take the wine.
- Okay, great.

842
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,600
But only if it is diet.

843
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,000
Uh, make... make yourself at home.

844
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:11,500
So, uh, wow... how long since
I've seen you, anyway?

845
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,100
So, that was either totally
inappropriate and awkward, or...

846
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,200
Or it was really spontaneous and
and nice. I mean, it was nice for me.

847
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,900
- It was nice, wasn't it?
- Very.

848
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,300
- And not at all awkward.
- No. Not at all.

849
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,000
- Not like this conversation.
- Right.

850
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,000
- Drink?
- Oh, yeah. I'd love one.

851
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,600
Great.

852
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,500
I can't seem to...

853
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,800
- May I?
- Yes. Please.

854
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,800
- Can you excuse me...
- Oh, yeah.

855
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,600
Okay.

856
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,300
I'll be right back.

857
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,800
Nola Devlin, girl gone wild.

858
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,500
Okay, don't freak out.

859
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,300
Nance, what's wrong?

860
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,200
I'm working and my computer crashed.

861
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,600
Oh, well, nancy, I know that's a real
bummer, and I'm sorry, but I gotta...

862
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,600
Yeah, but they sent Chip over to fix it.
He's standing in front of me right now,

863
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,300
and believe me, he is so not
the hot guy from the gym.

864
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,100
No, Chip is standing in my living room
right now. He just kissed me.

865
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,900
Whoever kissed you
isn't Chip, the computer guy.

866
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,200
Well, then, who the hell
is standing in my living room?

867
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,000
Who are you?

868
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,000
I know you're not Chip.

869
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,200
Oh, god. Listen...

870
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,000
No, no, no. Are you even in tech support?

871
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
No.

872
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,300
Oh, god, please tell me you're not a serial killer.

873
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,000
I'm not a serial killer.

874
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,800
Look, you can put down the candlestick.

875
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,700
Who are you?

876
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,700
Alex Stanson.

877
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,400
As in Stanson Publishing "Alex Stanson"?

878
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,800
That would be my father, Alex senior.

879
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,900
So... Why did you get me
think you were computer Chip?

880
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,000
That day that you got
in my truck thinking I was Chip,

881
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,300
I... I had just come
from a meeting with my father.

882
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:17,600
My relationship with him is...
strained at best.

883
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,600
And you totally turned
that day around for me.

884
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,500
You were unguarded, gutsy,
funny, and you were interested in me.

885
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,000
I didn't want to ruin it by telling you
who I was. I tell people who I am

886
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,100
and they just start acting differently.

887
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,900
Plus, I'm kind of in this
new phase of my life.

888
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,000
Your "fat girl" phase?

889
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,000
My "trying to be a better person" phase.

890
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,800
I have one last shot to prove
my worth in the family business.

891
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,400
You see, I quit five years ago,
and, uh, now that I've come back,

892
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,600
my father put me in charge
of a new book division.

893
00:51:59,100 --> 00:51:59,700
My idea.

894
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,200
Our first book...

895
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,400
Is a collection of Belinda Apple's columns.

896
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,800
I am so... achingly aware of that,
and this has just become a nightmare.

897
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,600
You knew I edited her columns.

898
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,400
Yeah.

899
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,600
Please go.

900
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,400
Look, nola...

901
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,800
You used me.

902
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,400
That... that is not true.

903
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,800
I mean, yes, okay, in the beginning, I,
yeah, maybe I saw an opportunity

904
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,400
to learn more about Belinda,
but then that-- that changed,

905
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,000
and I wanted to learn more about you.

906
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Belinda works for you.

907
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,500
I work for you.
Your family...

908
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,900
This doesn't work. Okay?
It doesn't work.

909
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,200
You have... please don't say anything else.

910
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,200
Just... just go.

911
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,700
Alex Stanson Jr., the only heir
to the Stanson empire,

912
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:18,600
which includes magazines, newspapers,
extensive real estate holdings,

913
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,900
has turned being a trust fund
playboy into an art.

914
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,500
He goes through women
like other men go through socks.

915
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,400
Devlin?

916
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,800
Yeah.

917
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,600
Do you know what this is?

918
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,600
Belinda Apple's contract for her book.

919
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,800
Do you know what should be right there?

920
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,900
Her signature.

921
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,200
The book launch party is in less than a week.
Legal is going crazy.

922
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,600
I sent someone from our london office
to the address Belinda gave us,

923
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,300
but all she found was a post office box
with some fan mail addressed to Belinda.

924
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,800
I need proof of life.

925
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,400
What, like Belinda's severed ear
wrapped in today's newspaper?

926
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,600
No. Like a personal
appearance on September 5th.

927
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,200
If she doesn't show,
that will be my proof.

928
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,800
I will go talk to Legal
after lunch, okay?

929
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,400
Hey, nancy, are we still meeting
at the track after work? I...

930
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,400
I really need to talk.

931
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,300
Nance!

932
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,200
Oh! thank god!

933
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,600
I get that you didn't want
to talk about it last night,

934
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,100
and I'm glad that
you're still alive, but

935
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,600
who the hell was
the guy in your apartment?

936
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,400
All right, it turns out that
the most perfect guy I've ever met

937
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,500
is the guy publishing
Belinda Apple's new book

938
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,800
Alex Stanson junior.

939
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,000
Your "chip" is Alex Stanson?
No way.

940
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,300
Yes. yes, yes. yes way.

941
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,600
Wow.

942
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,100
Oh, god. there's more.

943
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,300
I really liked him, a lot.
And the awful part is

944
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,400
I think he really liked me.

945
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,500
Well, why are you talking
about this in the past-tense?

946
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:58,000
Because there can be no future-tense.
There can't be any... tense.

947
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,600
Listen, I...

948
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,400
I need...
I need to tell you something, okay?

949
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,600
What?

950
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,900
I'm Belinda Apple.

951
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,600
What?

952
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,500
That's impossible.

953
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,100
You know, nine months ago,
Lori wanted an advice columnist,

954
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,000
and she wouldn't give me a shot
because I didn't look the part?

955
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,600
All right, well,
I came up with a plan, and...

956
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,800
I created "Belinda Apple".

957
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,400
That's not a plan, that's insanity.

958
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,300
Yeah.

959
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,800
Who's the woman on the billboards?

960
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,300
Me, with a little Photoshop.

961
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,100
Does anyone else know about this?

962
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,400
No! It wasn't supposed to go this far.

963
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,400
I mean, she wasn't supposed
to become famous.

964
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,000
I just... I was going to write as Belinda
for a little while to prove that I

965
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,700
could do it, and then I was going
to go into Lori's office and

966
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,800
tell her that she shouldn't judge
people on their jean size,

967
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,800
she should be judging them on
their qualifications.

968
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,600
Yeah, I really wish that you had.
I mean...

969
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,900
You deserve that job, fat or thin.
You just... you need to believe that you deserve it.

970
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,800
Yeah.

971
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,800
Nancy, listen...

972
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,600
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

973
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,400
Look, putting aside the fact that
one of my best friends couldn't...

974
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,400
wouldn't tell me about something
this important,

975
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,800
putting thataside,
do you have any idea what kind of

976
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,000
a professional crap-storm
you've just rained down on me?

977
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,000
I'm so sorry.

978
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,100
Look, if I don't say something,
and this comes out,

979
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,500
I could be fired for knowing about
it and doing nothing.

980
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,500
So what are you going to do?

981
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,800
Nothing.

982
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,400
I know you.

983
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,000
I love you.

984
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,800
And you will do the right thing.

985
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,600
Yeah.

986
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,000
You know, one good thing
has come out of all of this.

987
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,100
What?

988
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,400
The Cinderella pact.
You look amazing.

989
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,500
Yeah, I've lost another five pounds.

990
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,900
Oh, god. Nancy,

991
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,200
how am I going to get out
of this in one piece?

992
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,800
Lori's coming apart at the seams.

993
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,700
I mean, she's got this contract she wants
Belinda to sign. You know? she's crazy!

994
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,800
And I can't keep
stalling her for very much longer.

995
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,400
Come on. we're going to figure this out.

996
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,500
It's Deb.

997
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,700
- Where?
- Shh.

998
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Hey, Deb.

999
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,500
Hey. Deb, where are you?

1000
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,600
If anything, scotch makes you happy.

1001
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,000
Hey, guys! this is josh.

1002
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,400
Josh, these ar the friends
I was telling you about.

1003
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,500
Do you want a drink?

1004
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,600
No. No, I think we're good.

1005
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,800
I thought you weren't supposed
to drink after your surgery?

1006
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,000
Who're you, her mother?

1007
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,700
No, josh. Her best friend.

1008
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,700
Come on.

1009
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,000
Do you mind telling us
what you think you're doing?

1010
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,200
I was just having some fun.
Is that a crime?

1011
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,600
Okay, "fun" is a pedicure.
"Fun" is... is a great day at the beach.

1012
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,900
A fast car is "fun"...

1013
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,700
not knocking back manhattans
with some random businessman.

1014
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,900
You're married!

1015
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:00,400
I know. I've been settling my whole life.
I don't want to settle anymore.

1016
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:05,700
You know, it's terrifying,
but for the first time ever,

1017
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,400
I feel like I have choices.
And ain't that why I went through the surgery?

1018
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:11,900
Do you know what I did today?

1019
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,200
I went to an assembly at my son's
school. I was so happy being there,

1020
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,700
just a mom sitting in the audience,
not some fat woman everyone was staring at.

1021
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,900
Paul never showed.

1022
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,600
Do you know why I married him?

1023
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,500
Because I was scared
no one else would have me.

1024
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,700
You know what's worse?
He knew that!

1025
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,700
I mean, he doesn't love me,
he just wants to control me.

1026
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,500
Are you going to leave him?

1027
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,500
I don't know.

1028
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,900
What would Belinda say?

1029
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,500
Yeah. what would Belinda say?

1030
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,700
I think she'd tell you that you deserve
better than trolling in bars for
attention from strange men.

1031
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,700
You are better.
And you know what?

1032
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,000
You should create the life you deserve.

1033
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,500
That's exactly what she'd say.

1034
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,700
Yeah, no joke.

1035
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,900
Tell her.

1036
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,100
What?

1037
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,100
She is Belinda.

1038
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,200
That's impossible.

1039
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,100
You're Belinda?

1040
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,400
I'm Belinda.

1041
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,800
But how?

1042
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,600
It's really complicated.
I mean...

1043
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,600
well, I started by submitting
my columns electronically to Lori.

1044
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,900
Do you mean all the advice
I got from Belinda,

1045
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,700
the advice that I changed my life for,
the Cinderella pact, that was all a lie?

1046
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,500
No. no! I-I believed every word.

1047
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,000
It just... it seemed like you
would listen to it more

1048
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,800
when it came from someone like Belinda.

1049
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,800
I just want what's best for you.

1050
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,600
And to regain my power
and be the person I am inside.

1051
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,500
Yes! yes! yes!

1052
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,500
That was part of the pact,
and we were supposed to be honest

1053
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,500
We would always be honest
with one another,

1054
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,200
and you were lying from the start.

1055
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,000
You never believed any of this could be real.

1056
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,100
That's not true.
I hoped it would be. I did.

1057
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,600
Losing weight has given me
the confidence to stand up

1058
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,000
for myself and be honest about my feelings.

1059
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,400
You have no idea how much you hurt me.

1060
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,000
Well, I don't want to deal with this right now.

1061
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,700
I can't.

1062
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,800
I'll go.

1063
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,800
Nola, hi. Sorry about
leaving a message. Again.

1064
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,900
Since I haven't heard from you,

1065
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,800
you are either, "a" on a road trip with
Otis and too busy to check your messages,

1066
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,000
or "b" in the finals of an
international croquet tournament,

1067
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,100
and unaware you have messages, or...
"c" avoiding me and hoping I stop calling.

1068
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,700
I vote for "a" or "b",
because "c" makes me sad.

1069
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,400
Yes, hello, is charlotte there?

1070
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,600
This is her client, Belinda Apple.

1071
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,200
Could you let her know that I need her
to call me as soon as possible, please?

1072
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,200
Thank you.

1073
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,100
Charlotte?

1074
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,300
Yes?

1075
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,200
I'm Nola Devlin, Belinda Apple's editor.

1076
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,300
Where is she?

1077
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,300
Actually, you're looking right at her.

1078
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,600
I'm Belinda Apple.

1079
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,400
Of course you are, darling.
There's a little bit of "Belinda" in all of us.

1080
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,600
No, charlotte.

1081
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,400
I'm your client.
I'm Belinda Apple.

1082
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:23,100
But you're so not-british, or stylish.
No-- no offense.

1083
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,700
I thought you'd be younger, but then,

1084
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:31,200
maturity is just experience
wrapped in wrinkles, isn't it?

1085
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh, my god. You really are Belinda.

1086
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,700
Correction-- I've been pretending to be her,
and I've hurt the people I love the most.

1087
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:42,600
My whole life is a monumental trainwreck.

1088
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,300
I'm probably going to get fired, go to jail,

1089
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:47,100
and never work as a journalist again,
and I was just wondering if you could help me.

1090
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,900
Oh, lord, let's get you a drink.

1091
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,400
Wow, you have got yourself into quite the quandary.

1092
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,900
I know, and I can't fake it anymore.
I can't.

1093
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:03,600
You can fake a lot of things,
but you cannot fake talent,
whether you call yourself Belinda or Nina...

1094
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,400
Nola.

1095
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,200
Whatever. You are a writer.
Believe in that. Women love your column.

1096
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,400
I have the fan mail to prove it.

1097
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,600
Fan mail is not going
to keep me out of jail.

1098
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,000
Okay, then. okay, then.

1099
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,100
You do have some options.
One: do nothing.

1100
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,800
Let the chips fall where they may.

1101
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:27,900
Two: write a letter of resignation,
quit before the whole thing falls apart.

1102
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,000
But your legal problems won't go away.

1103
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,800
Or three: show up, tell the truth,
and watch the whole thing implode in person.

1104
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,900
It's perfect.

1105
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,600
Well, not the imploding part, of course, but

1106
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,000
why shouldn't you go to that party?

1107
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,500
Um, here's a clue: I'm not Belinda Apple.

1108
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,700
Not yet. But with a litte work...

1109
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,400
I think you could bring her to life.

1110
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,700
You're crazy.

1111
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,000
Yeah, "crazy" is sometimes the basis of genius.

1112
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,200
Go as Belinda.

1113
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,100
You keep your secret, I keep my commission.
It's a win-win situation.

1114
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,100
Nobody is ever going to believe
that I'm Belinda Apple.

1115
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,200
Think about it.

1116
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,800
Nola?

1117
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:28,400
Hmm? Chip! Alex...
whoever you are.

1118
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,900
What are you doing here?

1119
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,400
Um, I was supposed to meet
Belinda Apple's literary agent

1120
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,000
but I just got a message
saying she had to cancel.

1121
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,000
Have you eaten dinner?

1122
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,400
Haven't eaten lunch and...
this is dinner. Mm!

1123
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,900
Wow. It looks like your Cinderella
diet's a little extreme.

1124
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:50,400
"Cinderella pact"

1125
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,400
Right.

1126
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,000
And you have no idea how extreme.

1127
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,500
It kinda messes with your head, you know?

1128
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,000
I don't, but I know
you need some food, real food,

1129
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,300
and since it looks like
you've lost even more weight,

1130
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,000
I think you could afford
to eat something.

1131
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:05,600
Thank you.

1132
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,500
Sorry I lied.

1133
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,200
Okay, listen. you lie, I lie,
everybody lies.

1134
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,000
We all tell little lies,
and big lies, and middle-of-the-road lies.

1135
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,000
We're not to be trusted.

1136
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,600
Cheaters never prosper. Or is it liars?
Gosh, I can never remember.

1137
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,700
Go home... Alex Stanson.

1138
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,400
I don't want to go home.

1139
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,900
You're a nice guy.

1140
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,100
You're a really, really nice guy.
You're too nice for me.

1141
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,400
That's not true.

1142
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,900
You don't know the real Nola Devlin,
the inner-workings, the heart and soul.

1143
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:55,700
Here's what I do know. Nola Devlin
is funny, smart, pretty.

1144
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,500
See?
Too nice.

1145
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:02,200
I like who I am with you.

1146
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,400
I'm not who you think I am.
I mean, I am, I am, but I'm not.

1147
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,900
Don't we all feel that way?

1148
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,100
Oh, listen, I'm serious.
There is no...

1149
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,300
Very nice.

1150
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,000
Did I just say that out loud?

1151
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:25,800
No.

1152
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,300
Oh, sorry.

1153
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,100
Wait.

1154
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:48,100
I-I'm not like other girls you've been with,
so I just wanted you to...

1155
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:48,800
Thank god.

1156
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,800
No, it's just that...
See. My body is...

1157
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,400
Beautiful.

1158
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,600
You have a beautiful body.

1159
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,900
Let's never leave here, ever.

1160
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,700
Oh, god. Let me guess.
Taiwan for six weeks.

1161
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:25,100
No. Actually L.A. for a shareholder's
meeting, and then back here friday for
the book launch.

1162
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,600
Alex, about the book launch...

1163
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:36,000
What if Belinda doesn't show?
I mean, she can be really unreliable.

1164
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:43,600
Well, if she doesn't show
she'll be letting down a lot of people.

1165
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,400
I'm sure it would be
disappointing for you,

1166
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,700
since you're as much a part
of the book as Belinda is.

1167
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,800
- Look, Alex, I...
- Nola,

1168
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,900
I think I'm falling in love with you.

1169
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,200
Chip? A-Alex?

1170
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,100
- Hey.
- Hi.

1171
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,200
Good morning.

1172
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,800
I have to catch my flight. Go back to sleep.

1173
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,700
I'll see you at the book launch.

1174
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,500
All right.

1175
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:28,399
Get some rest.

1176
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:29,200
Okay.

1177
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,300
Bye.

1178
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,600
Wait.

1179
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:45,500
There is no Belinda Apple,
and I'm a big fat liar.

1180
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,200
Hey, Nola! whatcha doing?

1181
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,600
Hey, joy, have you seen Lori?

1182
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,399
She's getting her dress
fitted for the party.

1183
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,130
Oh, but, hey, if you see her,

1184
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,000
can you tell her that Belinda's agent
sent over a ton of fan mail
from her office last night?

1185
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,399
Fan mail?

1186
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,100
Well, it is in the mailroom.

1187
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,000
Thanks, joy.

1188
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,800
Dear Belinda,
you saved my life! I was 216...

1189
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,900
Dear Belinda, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1190
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,500
Belinda, you are my guardian angel.
You inspired me to follow my dreams.

1191
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,200
Dear Miss Apple, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here writing this letter.

1192
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Hey, Nance.

1193
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,200
Hey. You ready for tomorrow?

1194
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,800
What's tomorrow?

1195
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,200
Oh, it's end-game.

1196
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,000
The day we go back to the Willoughby cafe
and witness some serious grovelling?

1197
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,500
Right. Right. God.

1198
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,500
My dress is gone.

1199
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,400
Your goal dress?

1200
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,400
Have you heard from Deb?

1201
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,900
No.

1202
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,700
Alex Stanson said he loves me.

1203
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,900
I don't know what to do.

1204
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:54,600
I have this invitation here for Nola
to Belinda Apple's book launch.

1205
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,200
This is a letter from a woman in Duluth

1206
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,000
telling Belinda that she saved her life.

1207
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,400
Alex wants me, Nola,
to go to the book launch with him.

1208
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,600
This woman needs Belinda to show up.

1209
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,700
I can't be both people at the same time.

1210
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,700
Rewind.
He said he loves you?

1211
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,400
Yeah!

1212
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,200
Wow.

1213
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,500
And it's killing me.

1214
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,800
I just... should have listened!
You were right.

1215
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,800
You know, why did I make all this stuff up?

1216
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:32,600
I should have just believed in myself
enough to tell Lori the truth from the beginning, and...

1217
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,700
That is disgusting.

1218
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,100
Well, a little simplistic, maybe, but...

1219
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,900
For years, I have been hiding myself
under a homemade fat suit

1220
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,700
so you wouldn't treat me
like a sex object,

1221
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:47,600
and then I started shrinking
my body and building my self-esteem.

1222
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,500
I even started to think
"maybe Ted's not so bad".

1223
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,400
Maybe I was just imagining things

1224
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,900
but there is no way that I imagined
your hand on her ass

1225
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:00,800
a kid so fresh out of law school
that she still has the bar tapes memorized.

1226
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:02,900
You're fired.

1227
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,300
I don't think so.

1228
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,200
When I put together the
sexual harassment suit I have planned,

1229
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,700
you'll be the one holding the pink slip.

1230
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,000
- Did that feel as good as it looked?
- Oh, so much better.

1231
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,800
This doesn't feel right without Deb.

1232
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,200
She's... she'll come around.
She's just... she's got a lot going on right now.

1233
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,300
Ladies. table for two?

1234
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,300
Remember us?

1235
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,300
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

1236
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,600
We were here four months ago.

1237
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,200
You wouldn't seat us
at the table by the window.

1238
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,000
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

1239
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,600
We were a little bit... larger then.

1240
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,000
Yeah, we were fat.

1241
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,500
You said it was reserved.

1242
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,150
You were paranoid
about people walking by,

1243
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:00,200
thinking this is restaurant
where fat, pathetic women eat.

1244
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:08,000
So, you got all that from me telling you
that that table was reserved,
and I'm the one who's paranoid?

1245
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,900
We'll take the table by the window.

1246
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:14,400
I'm sorry. It's occupied.

1247
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,900
You mean we've been holding
a grudge for four months for nothing?

1248
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,900
No, but don't we look fabulous?

1249
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,500
I mean, the Cinderella pact worked.

1250
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,100
Yeah? then why are you still wearing black?
Where's your red?

1251
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:37,800
Deb, Deb, Deb. It's about
discovering the women we are inside.

1252
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,200
Let me tell ya, Ron is loving
the woman I am on the inside.

1253
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,200
Well, girls, I'm afraid
my bikini dream is over.

1254
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,200
- It was a tad too ambitious for me.
- No!

1255
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,700
No, but I'm looking forward to
dealing with reality in a tankini.

1256
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:59,700
You guys, I-I'm so happy that the
Cinderella pact worked for both of you,

1257
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,200
but I don't think it worked for me. See...

1258
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,500
I have no idea who I am or
what I'm supposed to do here.

1259
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,800
You know, like, the book launch is-- is
tomorrow night, and if I don't go,

1260
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,900
I'm going to betray all of those women who
poured their hearts out to me,

1261
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,500
and I don't want to hurt them

1262
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,400
the way you were hurt when you
found out Belinda Apple didn't exist.

1263
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:21,300
And Alex? I'm in love with him,
and he's gonna hate me.

1264
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,400
I should have told him!

1265
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,200
I should be telling him right now,
and I don't know how to.

1266
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,800
Belinda has to go to that party.

1267
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,700
Belinda doesn't exist.

1268
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,200
It's your wisdom, your wit, your insight.
You're the one everyone's listening to.

1269
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,100
You're the one who gave me
the courage to start a new life.

1270
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:47,000
As hard as it is, I have to leave Paul, .. it's okay.
It's good, even!

1271
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,900
And do you think that I could have
stood up to Ted without you or Belinda?

1272
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:55,900
She's been there all along.
You've just been looking on the outside
when you should've been looking in.

1273
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:01,500
So, no more broken cookies.
No more standing in the shadows.

1274
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,900
It's time you took centre stage. Okay?

1275
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,900
Okay.

1276
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,100
Nola? Before we get started...

1277
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:13,200
It wasn't gone!
We bought it for you a couple of days ago.

1278
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,300
Somehow we knew that you'd need it.

1279
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,600
And these.

1280
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,600
Oh, m--!

1281
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,000
And this. your fantasy car.

1282
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,700
You are Cinderella!

1283
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,100
Here it is.

1284
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,400
Oh, my goodness. I'm so nervous, you guys.

1285
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,700
Let's cover you up a little.

1286
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,500
Oh, that's perfect

1287
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,200
Beautiful.

1288
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,800
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

1289
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,300
Okay. - here we go.
Up.

1290
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,900
Belinda! Belinda!

1291
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,900
Belinda?

1292
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,900
She's really looking forward to meeting you.

1293
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,000
Is she ready?
I'd really like to see her.

1294
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,600
I will-- I will do that. thank you.

1295
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,700
- Alex, right? hi! I'm Deb.
- Hi. Yeah. The...

1296
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:47,400
- friend of Nola's. Gym.
- Right, the gym.

1297
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
ladies and gentlemen, tonight
we are here to introduce to you

1298
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,400
Stanson publishing's new book
"Apple gets to the core"

1299
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:01,400
a compilation of columns by Shine magazine's
renowned advice columnist, Belinda Apple.

1300
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:06,900
It is now my great honour to
introduce to you Belinda Apple!

1301
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,000
it's so nice to finally meet..

1302
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,400
oh, my god!

1303
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:33,900
Oh, thank you all for
the very warm welcome.

1304
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:41,600
I'm so happy I'm-- I'm so happy that
Stanson books is publishing my book.

1305
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,500
My book...

1306
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,000
It is my book.

1307
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,100
I can't do this.

1308
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:59,700
I thought I could but I...
I can't.

1309
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,200
A year ago

1310
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,000
I was an overweight copy editor

1311
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,800
who couldn't get a break.

1312
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:19,500
There were people who told me that
I was just a big girl with a big dream,

1313
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:24,400
and, um...
Somehow, I let myself believe that.

1314
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:32,200
So I created Belinda Apple, someone
I thought I could never be.

1315
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:37,200
Pretty, beautiful, confident, thin...

1316
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,100
Someone with all the answers.

1317
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:45,800
I used Belinda to protect myself
from rejection and failure.

1318
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,400
I'm so sorry that I lied

1319
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:57,000
to all of the women who have been
o honest with me, with Belinda.

1320
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,100
I have to be honest with you.

1321
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:11,300
There is no Belinda Apple,
there's just me, Nola Devlin.

1322
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,700
But here's the thing-- inside,
me and Belinda, we're the same person.

1323
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:21,000
It just took me till tonight to figure it out.

1324
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,400
To all the beautiful women
that brought me here tonight,

1325
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,300
just know that you're your own
fairy godmothers, so,

1326
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:36,300
keep dreaming your dreams
and creating your magic

1327
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,200
and writing your own happy endings.

1328
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,700
That's all.

1329
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,100
Great party!

1330
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,200
Oh, they loved you!

1331
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:03,000
They love Nola Devlin as much as they love Belinda Apple!

1332
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:03,700
Yeah!

1333
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,500
Have you guys seen Alex?

1334
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:09,700
Sorry, honey.
You know, I thought for sure he was going to forgive you.

1335
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,200
Oh, maybe he'll change his mind.

1336
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,100
Maybe.

1337
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,600
All right, i-- I think I'm going to head home.

1338
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,100
Oh.

1339
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,400
You guys, have fun.

1340
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,700
Well, you know what happens to Cinderella at midnight.

1341
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,500
No!

1342
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,100
W-wait!

1343
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,100
Wait, wait! please!

1344
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,100
Wait!

1345
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,000
Wait!

1346
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,900
Wait, stop, sir! please, stop!

1347
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,600
Just perfect.

1348
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,600
You lose something?

1349
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,400
Yeah.

1350
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,800
Yeah. My... shoe.

1351
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,600
May I?

1352
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,800
Midnight.

1353
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,500
Isn't that some kind of
defining moment for Cinderella?

1354
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:33,100
Well, it's the moment where she
turns back into her true self and...

1355
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,360
hopes that Prince Charming will see
through the disguise and forgive her and...

1356
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,000
But just...
one last question for Belinda.

1357
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:40,900
Yeah?

1358
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,800
Well, there's this girl...

1359
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,100
Ah, well, see? there's always a girl.

1360
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,000
What's the problem?

1361
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,200
A few days ago, I poured my
heart out to her

1362
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,000
and told her I thought
I was falling in love with her.

1363
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,800
Have you changed your mind?

1364
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,900
No.

1365
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,700
I told her how I feel.

1366
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,800
But she hasn't told me how she feels.

1367
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,900
Well, that's not a problem

1368
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,200
cause I happen to know
she loves you right back.

1369
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,600
Whoo-hoo!
