1
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,267
Happy Birthday to you!

2
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,571
You live in a shoe!

3
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,907
But that's not so bad...

4
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,542
'cause it's a Jimmy

5
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:48,776
Choo.

6
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,411
Show me your coin.

7
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,680
Ta-da.

8
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,215
"We rarely see someone fail..."

9
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,484
"...who has thoroughly
followed our path."

10
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,854
That'd look good next to yours.

11
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,324
You keep it. You've earned it.

12
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,127
And, happy second
birthday to you.

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,196
Sounds like something out
of Alice in Wonderland.

14
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,366
The day you were born, and
the day you got clean.

15
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,968
Here's to the newborn.

16
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,038
Cheers! It's gonna be
a hell of a year.

17
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:18,840
Fuck, yeah.

18
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,675
I love you, baby.

19
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:25,113
Aww. Okay...

20
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,582
Make a wish.

21
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:02,550
So it's just this head?

22
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,453
Of a woman, yeah.

23
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,556
And the guts hang out?

24
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,925
While it's floating in the air.

25
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,294
That's gross. That's gross.

26
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,764
Uh, what about your fairy tales?

27
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:21,536
The dude-bros,
forcing themselves
on princesses while they sleep.

28
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,236
No, I mean...

29
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,272
I've never heard of
it... the, uh...

30
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,842
Penanggalan. Is
that how you say it?

31
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,546
Or Arp. That's... what
my Ba used to call it.

32
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,345
Your grandma?

33
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,615
Yeah, my grandma.

34
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,920
That woman was obsessed
with my virginity

35
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,755
for some reason, you know?

36
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:41,689
Sure.

37
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,558
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know.

38
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:47,427
Yeah, she wanted me to be a
doctor. Or someone who builds
shit.

39
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,663
I dunno. Something like that.

40
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:52,033
So she told you about
this vampire thing?

41
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:57,672
Yeah, I mean it was it was
like a vampire. See,
I was supposed to be pure
so she told me all

42
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:04,145
these disgusting stories
to scare me. I was
only 10 years old. So, basically,
they're abstinence PSAs.

43
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,747
Gotcha.

44
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,916
Just because I wanted
to be an actor.

45
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,518
So, she thought you were, uh...

46
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:14,287
A slut. Bad girl. "Don't
be a slut..."

47
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,324
"...Or the floating head will
come eat your baby."

48
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,627
"Suck your fetus
right outta ya!"

49
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,364
So, so gross.

50
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:30,104
Oh, my grandma. She
loved talking about

51
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:32,073
fetus cannibalism.

52
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,975
You still had sex, though?

53
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:40,681
Of course. All the time.
Yeah, but that's
not the point. Tell
me about your mom.

54
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:43,718
She fuck you up with
fairy tales too?

55
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,219
Nah...

56
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,955
My mom never told me
stuff like that.

57
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:49,356
Oh... so...

58
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,926
She went for the good-old
warm and fuzzies.

59
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,762
The Old Man Who Sees You
When You're Sleeping.

60
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:55,763
Yeah, right.

61
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:58,099
Oh, no. Or the capitalist
propaganda...

62
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,200
THROW-UP A BODY PART!

63
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,400
PUT IT UNDER YOUR PILLOW!

64
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,435
GET SOME MONEY!

65
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,339
Or, the, umm... the
Giant Mutant Bunny,
Who Profiteers Off Of
Eggs. The classics!

66
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,109
Mm-hmm.

67
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,144
Oh, my god!

68
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:12,280
We're talking about my mom!

69
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,117
Well, that's when you
know you've made it.

70
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,085
Where? To Freud's couch?

71
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,788
Ah! Freud's full of shit.

72
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:26,093
So what did you mean?
"I made it"...?

73
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,161
A real...

74
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:33,100
Relationship.

75
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:41,209
I dunno. My mom was just... Mom.

76
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:43,177
That was scary enough.

77
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,179
You make her sound
like a Succubus.

78
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:47,715
She was.

79
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,519
Couldn't be all that bad.

80
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,087
Oh, just wait till
you meet her...

81
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,896
Chocolate is
Massimo's favorite.

82
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,599
Oh, I know. He's quite
the Chocoholic.

83
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,973
I bet she was a badass.

84
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,675
Things were better
before Dad left.

85
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,944
Did she ever call the cops?

86
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,848
They didn't do much. Figured
he went down to Mexico.

87
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:26,687
Mom said he was into a lot of
nasty shit with a lot of nasty
people.

88
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,922
Drugs?

89
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:34,528
Drugs. Money. I dunno. He just
fell off the face of the Earth.

90
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,999
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,002
Yeah, but... Crate's
been good to her.

92
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:41,769
Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:42,703
Your Stepdad.

94
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:44,505
Zeb Crate.

95
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:47,975
Vino?

96
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,043
Oh, no. Thanks.

97
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,945
Uh, she doesn't drink.

98
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,224
Crate knew my Dad.

99
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,961
Helped set me up.
Odd jobs, here and there.

100
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,797
You live around here?

101
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,200
Uh, no. She's got a place
in the Valley.

102
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,802
So... you two aren't, uh...?

103
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,904
No! No, we're not
living together.

104
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:18,906
Well... not yet.

105
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:26,080
Um...

106
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,481
Zeb's a real Chocoholic too.

107
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:33,287
Mm-hmm. Goddamn right. Love
me some Chocolate.

108
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:34,989
And you're an... Alcoholic...

109
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,057
Right?

110
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,227
Zeb...

111
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:48,703
Oh, that's okay. That was
a long, long... really
long time ago. That's
why I have this.

112
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:01,916
Oh, well...

113
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,150
Good for you, honey.

114
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,485
What do you do?

115
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,056
I'm a bartender.

116
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,890
Really?

117
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,226
Uh, over
in Beverly Hills.

118
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:15,796
Sounds risky.

119
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,498
- Are you fucking kidding
me...? - Shh...

120
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,034
Massimo...

121
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,104
Did I say... Anything?
- He meant that as a compliment.

122
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:32,046
So you know a little bit
about this? - Oh, yes.
That's Chorazos. Uh, that's a
pretty swanky...

123
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,214
...pinot noir you have.

124
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,682
Goddamn right, it is.

125
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,450
Well, we love it.

126
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:38,052
It's from the Carpathians.

127
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,220
Where?

128
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:43,491
Transylvania. - Oh,
where the vampires live.

129
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,892
Something like that.

130
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,129
I never
drink... alone.

131
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:51,032
Okay, Dad jokes.

132
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,931
I'm sorry. I've
got to split.

133
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,301
Thanks for coming by, babe.

134
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,803
Nice to meet you both.

135
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,274
Call you tomorrow?

136
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,275
Sounds good.

137
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,086
So...? What
did you think?

138
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:46,887
Um... she's...

139
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,756
Nice, right?

140
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,959
She's very... - What'd
you say she does again?

141
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,296
I don't think I did say.

142
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,364
So what does she do?

143
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,166
Yes, honey. What was it again?

144
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,935
She's a bartender, mom.
- Oh, that's right.

145
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,937
So, she ever consider doing
anything else? Like a...

146
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,206
That's very
brave.
- ...career... Or a...?

147
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,842
Real job?

148
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:15,850
Well, the pay's pretty good.
She's an actress, and...
she's amazing. She's gonna be a
big star

149
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,385
Is that so?
- Yeah, that's so.

150
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,287
That's nice.

151
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:24,225
It's not like she
works in a dive
bar downtown. She works
in Beverly Hills.

152
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,427
Well, what about?

153
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,361
What about me?

154
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,163
Maybe she can get you a job.

155
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:29,730
A job?

156
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:30,764
He's got a job!

157
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:31,665
I just thought he could...

158
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,200
Could what?!

159
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:34,835
Don't talk to her like that!

160
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,971
It's okay honey, um...

161
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:38,973
So you want me to hear him out?

162
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,708
Yes. You need
to hear me out.

163
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,076
Just listen to your father.

164
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,345
Jesus Christ, he's
not my father.

165
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,479
Aw, honey... I just...

166
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,149
I've already heard it,
mom. All of it.

167
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,484
That's not what this is about.
Course not.
No one is saying...

168
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,719
I'm not with Tien for a job.

169
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,320
Did we say that?!
- No, we didn't.

170
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:56,157
Did we say anything even
remotely close to that?

171
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,359
Honey, we just want
what's best for you.

172
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:06,767
"Tien"... "Tien"...
That's, uh, Chinese?

173
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,102
Vietnamese.

174
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,138
So she's got like a... work
visa, or something?

175
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,439
She was born here.

176
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:14,375
That's nice. Her parents
live here?

177
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:15,843
Yes, mom. They were born here.

178
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,779
I meant, do they live
in California.

179
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:22,349
You know, your
uncle was in Vietnam.

180
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:25,252
What? What uncle?

181
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:26,253
His brother, honey.

182
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:30,724
They tortured the shit
out of him in a camp.

183
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,930
What is this? Jesus Christ,
what is this shit?!

184
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,532
Hey, watch your language.

185
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,200
Just... get out of here.

186
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:39,833
Honey, we just...!

187
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,102
GET THE FUCK OUT!

188
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,408
Honey...

189
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,743
- Wait in the car.
- Please!

190
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:52,346
Wait for me in the car.
It'll be fine.

191
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,047
Please don't do anything...

192
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,248
CAR!!

193
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:13,834
What've you told her?

194
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,041
Nothing.

195
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,776
Did you tell her what you do?

196
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:32,253
Tien doesn't know shit.

197
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,456
Break it off.

198
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,660
What?

199
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,427
You heard me.

200
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:47,101
You can't be serious.
This
is not open to discussion.

201
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,035
FUCK YOU!!

202
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:58,879
Who do you think you're talking
to? I'm not some
fucking politician. I
am king and country.

203
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,182
She's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

204
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,852
I am the best thing
that's ever going
to happen to you. Alright?

205
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:08,255
Don't you see it?
She's playing you
for the money. For MY money!

206
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:12,192
It's not like that!
- She's a drunk.

207
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:19,668
All right? Can't you see
what's gonna happen?
You're fire, she's gas. You are
heading for one big boom!

208
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:22,036
Look what she did for me.

209
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,774
That is the badge of a weak man.

210
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,578
You're not weak.

211
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:36,417
Fine.

212
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,054
Don't forget who pays the bills.

213
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,693
You made your point.

214
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:48,095
And that stuff about
a job. She's
just blowing smoke up your ass.

215
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:53,467
All right? You got one purpose
in this life and
that's whatever the
fuck I say it is.

216
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:56,370
Get out.

217
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:57,438
Break it off.

218
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,498
Fuck.

219
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,539
Go away!

220
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,681
Said go away.

221
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,949
Massimo?

222
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,319
Tien?

223
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,992
Who are you?

224
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,662
Well, hello to you too.

225
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,142
Can I come in?

226
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,951
Ah, Chorazos.

227
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,694
No, no wine.

228
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:34,736
Something I gotta tell
you, and you should
listen, cause it's gonna
change your life.

229
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,832
Massimo!

230
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,300
"Messy Massimo."

231
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:08,603
Are you okay?

232
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:13,407
What do you mean?
- I've been trying
to get a hold of you for a week!

233
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:14,975
A week?

234
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,478
Babe, what's going on?

235
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,917
Tien, I...
- You know, I was gonna try
to get a hold of your parents,
but you never gave me their...

236
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:31,091
I can't see you anymore...
It's not gonna work.

237
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:37,665
Why? I... I don't understand.

238
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:42,704
I'm sorry. I didn't want
this to happen, not
like this... Jesus, fuck!

239
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:44,204
Talk to me. What's going on?

240
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:47,241
What's wrong?
- You won't understand!

241
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,211
What's going on?

242
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:56,718
I fucked up... Babe, I
fucked up real bad.

243
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,859
Please don't do this!

244
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,728
Honey.

245
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:09,162
NO...! Get the fuck out!

246
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,666
We just love you.

247
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,869
You're not my mom.

248
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:24,812
Baby, I'm
not going anywhere.

249
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:27,080
Stop it!

250
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,483
Is it the job?

251
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,553
What?

252
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,922
For Crate?

253
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:39,794
No, it's not that...
Don't call him.
Don't call Crate. I'm telling
you, don't call him.

254
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,729
I don't know what else to do!

255
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:45,700
Okay... All right... okay, we
can... we can handle this...

256
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:51,039
How deep are you in?

257
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,439
What do you mean?

258
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,809
Crate. I know what's
going on. I can help you.

259
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,511
No, no. It's not Crate.

260
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:57,244
I'm coming over.

261
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,412
No, don't do that!

262
00:17:58,445 --> 00:17:59,346
WHY?!

263
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,481
YOU CAN'T! Just...
look, I'm sorry...

264
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:02,249
WHAT IS GOING ON?!

265
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,058
What the hell was that?

266
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,459
Honey?

267
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,162
Who's that?

268
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:17,732
Who're you talking to?

269
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:23,805
I'm Tien. Who are you?

270
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:25,807
Thought you told her.

271
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,154
Who are you?

272
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,924
Who do you want me to be?

273
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:46,326
I'm Sofia. He didn't tell you?

274
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,130
Tien... there's... something
I need to tell you...

275
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,399
You don't need to tell her shit.

276
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,382
Take a hint.

277
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:27,167
Good boy.

278
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:29,236
A week?

279
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:35,242
The transformation takes
time. We've got plenty of it.

280
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,911
I can't remember anything.

281
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:41,149
Look on the bright side.
All those habits of your's...

282
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,283
...those appetites...

283
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,285
...can't hurt you now...

284
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,489
Indulge them.

285
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:50,158
You're cute.

286
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,628
No, I can't!

287
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:58,933
Oh, baby. I could
just eat you up.

288
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:17,044
Baby...

289
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,583
I'm not going anywhere.

290
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,724
Why are we here?
- You wanted to be discreet.

291
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:34,394
Yeah, but I
choose the place.
And not at fucking night.

292
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:39,033
It was a hot day.
You ever think the
sun is having a midlife crisis?

293
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,935
You look like shit.

294
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,907
- It's been hard for
me. - How so?

295
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,976
Going outside.

296
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,180
Oh, yeah? Well, excuse
the fuck out of
me. All right. Sorry
I cut into your

297
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:58,418
nightlife you millennial
soyboy piece of shit.
Did you count it?

298
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,621
You wouldn't want that.

299
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:02,690
Good boy.

300
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:05,392
Just took my cut.

301
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,029
Well, that would be counting it.

302
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:14,702
Here. Your mother wants you
to have that. Consider
it a bonus.

303
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:22,409
Like a raise?
- Something like that.

304
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:24,779
There any more?

305
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:25,646
How's that?

306
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,849
I mean, that's not
much of a raise.

307
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:30,184
So we're gonna talk about money?

308
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:31,185
Look, if you want to
talk about money...

309
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:32,053
I've more than earned it.

310
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,120
We're not gonna talk.

311
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:34,121
I don't wanna talk
about the money.

312
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:36,356
You should know,
it's about Tien.

313
00:22:38,326 --> 00:22:39,794
We're not going to talk
about her either.

314
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:40,661
Maybe we should.

315
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:45,566
You are
a cock-sucking
little cockroach.

316
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:51,438
Be a pro. Do it right,
or don't do it at all.

317
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,142
Go ahead... Please.

318
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:07,021
You are one dumb son of a bitch.

319
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:11,993
Contact said for me to take
the car and the bag...

320
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:14,929
So get the fuck out.

321
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,950
Why're you
still going out
there? - I miss the sun.

322
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,187
So did my ex...

323
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:42,023
Till about... Lincoln.

324
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:42,890
Ex?

325
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,226
Believe it or not, vampires
like monogamy.

326
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:47,995
What happened to him?

327
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,864
SHE didn't care for

328
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:59,340
LA, the people, the 21st
Century. She just
ripped your own guts out.
Nickel's worth of

329
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,475
free advice, stay away from
people you care about.

330
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,146
So that's why you don't
want me calling Tien?

331
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:07,214
Just looking out for you.

332
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,618
That the only reason?

333
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:18,192
You've got her eyes

334
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:45,252
So how was the job?

335
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,088
There was no job. - Oh, no?

336
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,122
THERE WAS NO JOB!

337
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,557
- Was there ever a job?
- Course not.

338
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,192
- Those even taste good?
- Course not.

339
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,930
There was a job.

340
00:24:56,664 --> 00:24:58,799
I knew it. - Knew what?

341
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,235
- Knew you'd do this.
- WHAT?

342
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:05,306
Lie to me. Then double
back. Then double back
on the double back.

343
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,540
I just told you the truth!

344
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:07,875
You said there was no job!

345
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:10,611
And there wasn't, until
there was...

346
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:12,213
He's my father... I owe him.

347
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,949
Oh, my god. I'm your father now!

348
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:16,751
Stop babying me.

349
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:19,653
I'm not here to baby you.

350
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:27,528
Look, I get it. You don't want
me doing mortal things.

351
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,897
Don't you do that. Don't
you fucking do that!

352
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,233
Guess what? - I know
what you're thinking.

353
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:33,067
GUESS WHAT?!

354
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,968
THERE'S NO CURE!

355
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,569
I'M NOT GIVING UP!

356
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:36,837
I'm out of here.

357
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:38,272
If only.

358
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:41,342
I'm not gonna play
a rousing game
of "bounce around the point".

359
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,277
Bounce out the door. Forever.

360
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:54,955
It's not my job to carry
your ass. You're not
even a good lay.

361
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:59,060
OW!!

362
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:06,300
What the fuck was that?
Did you bite me...?
You're gonna fucking bite
me?! For fuck sake!

363
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:09,870
That hurt, you little shit!
Think I'm fucking meat?

364
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,542
You think it's fucking feeding
time? Fuck you!

365
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,510
You can go FUCK YOURSELF!

366
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:34,428
Baby...

367
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,964
I'm not going anywhere.

368
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,705
Sounds like something out
of Alice in Wonderland.

369
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:22,209
Happy second birthday to you!

370
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:24,979
Sounds like something
out of Alice and Wonderland.

371
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,161
Here's to the newborn.

372
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:11,792
Let's call this what it
is. Next time you go
out, you're going
with a handler.

373
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:15,729
A fucking handler. You
should be ashamed of
yourself.

374
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,667
This is kindergarten bullshit
we're talking here.

375
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:27,341
Hi, it's Tien. I'm
out right now,
making the dream come true.

376
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,743
Crate? - Yeah?

377
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:34,114
What day is it?

378
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,985
So, you
know what to do.

379
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:43,490
You cunt.

380
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:47,394
Hi, honey.

381
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:49,463
Get out.

382
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,865
You don't get it.
- Oh, what's that?

383
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,569
This isn't something you can
wiggle your way out of.

384
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:56,538
I'll tell Tien.

385
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:58,640
Bad idea. - I will.

386
00:28:58,673 --> 00:28:59,873
I told you to burn her number.

387
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:00,841
I'll tell her everything!

388
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:03,811
And tell her what... exactly?

389
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:09,149
You bitch.

390
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,153
She wouldn't believe you anyway.

391
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,990
I can at least tell her
to get a crucifix.
Those don't work.

392
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:19,927
- She can pick up garlic pills!
- You're an idiot.

393
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,730
Why me?

394
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,397
Honey, you're tired. You're
still transitioning.

395
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,866
No, I want to know! I think
you owe me that.

396
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,134
I don't owe you shit.

397
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:31,872
You ruined my life!
- Not much to ruin.

398
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:36,877
Answer me, goddammit!

399
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,079
DON'T PUSH IT!

400
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:50,592
Could give you the long story.
That we've always
been here. That we're legion.
That we suck the

401
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:56,698
blood of all thy race. But you
know that. You've got Twitter.

402
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:58,767
So that's it?

403
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:09,744
That's all, Messy. And all there
ever will be. So, long story
short, your blood

404
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:14,649
smelled like cherry syrup,
and I was famished.

405
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:33,601
Gets easier, once your
tear ducts fall off.

406
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:55,289
So is there like
a rule book or something?

407
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:57,358
We're not Shriners.

408
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,261
Come on.

409
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,501
Nine times out of ten, the
sun doesn't mean shit.

410
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:09,269
But it hurts.

411
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:11,138
Yeah, I figured that
out for myself.

412
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,508
Then why go out?
- I have to work.

413
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:17,010
For what? For food? That's done.

414
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,514
But I'm hungry all the time.

415
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:21,583
You know why.

416
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:36,397
Okay, what is this?

417
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,666
That's O-Ayer,
or the O.A.E.

418
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,403
Supposedly,
it's the first
word of the first name...

419
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:45,906
...of the first being
born in the universe.

420
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,675
- So bullshit.
- Maybe.

421
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:48,676
Gobbledegook!

422
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,678
Okay, you know what? Lay off!

423
00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:01,623
Okay, so... it's... it's
like your religion?

424
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:04,091
It's a big part of our history.

425
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:12,232
O-Ayer isn't male or female. It's
not really consciousness as we
think of it. It's more like
this thing that...

426
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,101
- ...permeates existence.
- Creepy.

427
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:17,572
It's a metaphysical
concept. It's not
like there's something
actually...

428
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:20,307
...out there.
- Tell that to the Pope.

429
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,046
A lot of people did. In the 12th
Century. They were burned.

430
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,517
Friends of yours...? What else?

431
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:31,719
Like Holy Water?
- Something like that.

432
00:32:31,753 --> 00:32:33,987
There's nothing like
that. No stakes.

433
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:39,026
No crosses. Everything
is just marking time.

434
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,227
What do you mean?

435
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,666
Nothing can stop you... but you.

436
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:46,935
Sounds like an infomercial.

437
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,670
Fine! Then fuck off!

438
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:52,306
No! I... I want to hear it.

439
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:59,814
You got to know all the
tricks. It's a game.
Mind-over-matter,
like an athlete.

440
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:01,381
Mind-over-matter.

441
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:04,552
Here... Let me show you.

442
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,555
Hold your hand over that.

443
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,660
Bet I can get it first.

444
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:18,365
You're like a mile away.

445
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,704
Then it should be easy.
One... two... three!

446
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:28,342
Jesus!

447
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,844
Soon you'll be able to do that.

448
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:31,178
Shit.

449
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:34,314
Whatever you think you
had, it's gone.

450
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:38,987
You pissed it all away. Now
you gotta stay active.

451
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,588
What d'you mean?

452
00:33:40,622 --> 00:33:42,757
Hunting.

453
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:49,631
You gotta stay on the prowl. Otherwise
you start to lose track of time.
Faces, places. Even
your own name.

454
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:50,598
I can't.

455
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:59,373
Most blood-born, shall we say,
contagions... they affect
the body. This affects
everything else.

456
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,041
What about animal blood?

457
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:02,610
That's anemia. That's
a slow death.

458
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:03,477
That's not gonna cut it.

459
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:05,847
When the time comes, you'll
know what to do.

460
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:13,821
Besides, Job did his whole
submissive, dominatrix
dance with his Creator,
and didn't get shit.

461
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,823
At least you'll get laid.

462
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:24,933
Oh... Oh, Jesus...
Fucking Chirst!

463
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:37,344
Can you feel her?

464
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:37,946
No.

465
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:40,447
Concentrate.

466
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:45,753
Her perfume.

467
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:46,854
What about it?

468
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:48,322
It's bad.

469
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:52,259
She's at the...
Coming!

470
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:57,865
Hello?

471
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:00,334
Hey there.

472
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:01,536
Hi.

473
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:03,738
Open
it... Open it...

474
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:05,540
Are you gonna let me in?

475
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,809
Open
it... you've gotta!

476
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:10,612
Yeah, I mean. Yeah,
of course, I'll let
you in. Course I'll
let you in...

477
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:11,613
DO IT!

478
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:12,547
Okay!

479
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,954
What's the matter?

480
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:21,956
Nothing... nothing.

481
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,660
Aww... uh huh, No need
to be nervous.

482
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:27,996
You're right. I'm,
I'm, I'm sorry...

483
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,764
Uh, don't be sorry.

484
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:34,869
Um... Do you have a toilet?

485
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:39,239
Uh, yeah... it's... uh...

486
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:40,908
Are you okay?

487
00:35:40,942 --> 00:35:42,242
Uh huh.

488
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:44,512
What's wrong with your lip?

489
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:48,650
Oh, no. Uh... nothing,
nothing... nothing.

490
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,150
Okay.

491
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:52,352
I'm... I'm gonna make
a quick call.

492
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:53,655
Yeah.

493
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:02,997
She's
not calling anyone.

494
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:04,498
I know.

495
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:07,802
You can feel it,
can't you? You can feel her.

496
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,871
She's got no one to call.

497
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,707
What
else do you feel?

498
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:16,443
She's got a kid.

499
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:17,612
SOFIA Ignore that.

500
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:18,311
A boy.

501
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:19,279
Ignore it!

502
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:20,313
She doesn't know where he is.

503
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,583
So
she's got no one.

504
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,216
No.

505
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,952
Perfect. Hah.

506
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:27,755
She's AB Negative.

507
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,289
Good.

508
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:33,594
Smells thick... Like
Maraschino cherries.

509
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:35,797
What
does that tell you?

510
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,764
I don't know.

511
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:37,264
You got this.

512
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,099
I don't know!

513
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:40,267
Concentrate.

514
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:45,372
High glucose.

515
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:48,943
She's hyperglycemic.
Never given blood.

516
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:51,145
Very good.

517
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,113
She's had gonorrhea.

518
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:53,114
Doesn't matter.

519
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:53,948
I don't like it.

520
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:56,150
You will.

521
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:59,921
Her perfume is terrible...
Candy?

522
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:04,391
Oh! Heh. Hi there.
Are you peeking?

523
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:07,161
Sorry... sorry... sorry.

524
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:09,630
No problem. We all
have our kinks.

525
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:11,431
I'm sorry.

526
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:15,002
Mister Shy-Guy, Mister Shy-Guy,
Mister Shy-Guy.

527
00:37:15,036 --> 00:37:16,336
Um...

528
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:19,574
How about a drink?

529
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:21,809
No, that's cool.

530
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:23,243
Wine?

531
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:25,513
No, no. Its okay.

532
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,281
C'mon.

533
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,685
No, it's okay. Really.

534
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,821
Soda. I got soda.

535
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:35,957
Oh...

536
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,425
Uh, in a can?

537
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:39,961
Of course.

538
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:43,430
And it's in there...? Okay.

539
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:52,372
Uh, sorry I don't
have any... Diet.

540
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,642
Oh, that's all right.

541
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:57,111
Regular is fine.

542
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,247
Just, you know, that's
a lot of sugar.

543
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:03,050
Yeah.

544
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:09,924
Wow. Thirsty girl.

545
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,895
Uh huh.

546
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,496
Do you have a trash?

547
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:19,934
I, uh... I recycle.

548
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:22,937
Oh...! Oh, which one is it?

549
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,138
It's the, uh, the...

550
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:27,275
It's the small one?

551
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:32,747
Yeah? Hahahaha. Oh, my
god, you're so cute!

552
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:42,523
Mmm... You know, I used to have
a bae, and he had three
big bins, but they were like
all sorts of colors

553
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:49,964
for all his shit.
But they were big
though, like they were
big, I mean BIG big.

554
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,266
Yeah, it's pretty common.

555
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,569
Oh, I don't think so.

556
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:57,972
Yeah, no... it, it is...
it's standard.

557
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:01,809
Standard?

558
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:08,583
Uh, pretty standard.
Look, I, um...Look,
I gotta tell you something.

559
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:09,750
Hey!

560
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:17,725
Hey, who's that? Is that your
sister...? Cause she's hot.

561
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,795
She's, uh... she's out of town.

562
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:31,471
Yeah? Relax. Let's get this
shirt off. You know, you've
got me for an hour, but
you could have me for

563
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:40,081
the whole night for $200.

564
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:42,250
Yeah...? Cool.

565
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:44,886
Yeah? You got the cash?

566
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:46,486
Yeah, I got it.

567
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:48,455
Do you want the $200?

568
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:50,423
Yeah, I got all that.

569
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:57,698
Okay, baby... Let's
do some shots.

570
00:39:57,732 --> 00:39:58,465
Shots?

571
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:02,904
Yeah, let's do some shots.

572
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,876
Hey...!

573
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,578
Everything okay?

574
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:52,380
Hey, I put a record
on the player.
Got something
better here.

575
00:41:53,314 --> 00:42:03,424
Oh, shit. Is that the
shit?
- Let's, um, let's party.

576
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:08,162
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's party.

577
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:13,901
Ah, I like it.

578
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,636
Hahaha.

579
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:22,143
Mmm... this is gonna be juicy.

580
00:42:25,514 --> 00:42:27,516
- Tell me something.
- What up?

581
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:33,120
Candy is not your real name.

582
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:34,555
Sure, it is.

583
00:42:34,588 --> 00:42:41,429
No, it's not. I know it's not.
Okay, how do you
know that?

584
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:43,431
I can smell it.

585
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:45,399
Okay, that's really weird.

586
00:42:45,433 --> 00:42:51,472
Why is that weird? - Well,
it's just really weird.
I mean, but I like weird, so...

587
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:52,406
Hah.

588
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,975
So what's your real name?

589
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,945
What do you want it to be?

590
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:14,529
Why do you...? Why do you...?

591
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:18,933
C'mon, just lay back.

592
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,274
You shouldn't have left him.

593
00:43:27,842 --> 00:43:31,513
What...? What're you
talking about?

594
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:33,981
He's your son.

595
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:38,219
Who the fuck are you?

596
00:43:38,252 --> 00:43:39,753
You gotta call him.

597
00:43:39,787 --> 00:43:42,690
What...? What the
fuck is going on?

598
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:43,924
I'm sorry. You should go.

599
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:47,761
Shit! - What? What's
going on? What is it?

600
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:50,064
Um... where's my shirt?

601
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:51,465
Fuck your shirt!

602
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:53,100
Hold on!

603
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:54,335
Where's my money?

604
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:56,403
It's gonna be okay.

605
00:43:58,472 --> 00:43:59,541
Mom?!

606
00:43:59,574 --> 00:44:02,009
What're you doing?

607
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:07,014
I have to tell you something...
Who are you?

608
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:08,382
I... I... I'm...

609
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:10,384
Uh, this is Candy, mom. She's...

610
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,286
Your father is dead.

611
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,288
- Oh, shit.
- Crate?!

612
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:15,489
I didn't know where else to go.

613
00:44:15,524 --> 00:44:17,358
- Hang on, hang on...
- I'm sorry.

614
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:18,627
WHO'RE YOU?!

615
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:21,061
Hang on. Crate wasn't even
sick. Mom, Mom...

616
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:23,565
What happened? Just
tell me. Mom?!

617
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:27,768
Hey, hey. Give her a
second. Sit down.

618
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:39,046
There was an accident.
I was in the car...
He was driving. They said
he didn't suffer.

619
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:45,786
My dad died in a car accident.

620
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,258
I know.

621
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:57,364
Mmm, that was fun.

622
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,534
You crazy cunt.

623
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:02,937
Oh... don't act so precious.

624
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:08,577
C'mon... it's supper
time.
supper time... supper time...

625
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,401
Good morning, honey.

626
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:04,124
What's wrong, honey?

627
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:10,699
Fuck you.

628
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:13,802
Man, you need to lighten up.

629
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:14,803
Lighten up?

630
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:17,304
Okay, I get it. Ground rules.

631
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,207
I'm gonna kill you.

632
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:23,277
How?

633
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:26,681
Saved by the dinner bell.

634
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:28,949
That's not gonna happen.
Not gonna be anymore

635
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:30,851
goddamn dinner bells.

636
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:36,591
Oh, yeah? Wait till
you throw up that
breakfast I made you. Believe
me, it's not because

637
00:47:36,624 --> 00:47:39,259
of my cooking.

638
00:47:41,462 --> 00:47:50,404
Hello...? Yeah, Sparks
and Third...
In an hour. Yeah, got it.

639
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:52,807
Why do you keep doing that?

640
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:55,577
You don't owe anyone
anything, anymore.

641
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:57,945
Told you. Feel free to leave.

642
00:47:57,978 --> 00:48:00,214
I'm not gonna do that.

643
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:03,618
I love you.

644
00:48:05,018 --> 00:48:07,454
Are you fucking kidding me?

645
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:11,693
Wow. You know, you're
an asshole!

646
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:12,827
Oh, I'm the asshole?

647
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:14,895
That guy is not worth your time.

648
00:48:14,928 --> 00:48:20,835
No shit. But I'm not giving
up on my mom or
my life or any of it,
just to please you.

649
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:24,773
That's what I thought, until
my dad tried to burn
me at the stake.
- Oh, yeah? What'd you do?

650
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:26,875
Take a wild guess.

651
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:29,076
You don't even know me.

652
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:32,847
Universal donor...
Inflamed veins.

653
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:35,082
That's nothing.
It's nothing.

654
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:43,525
Came from The Scots. Clan
Ronald Mc-fucking-
Donald. You're a clown! Yeah,
right. I don't know you.

655
00:48:43,558 --> 00:48:45,593
What?

656
00:48:46,393 --> 00:48:47,896
Got an idea.

657
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:08,248
Okay, now you're just
fucking with me.

658
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:29,470
What the fuck are you
supposed to be? Some
sort of fucking weird mime?

659
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:32,574
Yeah, Massimo the
Mime. Who're you?

660
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:35,008
I'm Gage. As far as
you're concerned...

661
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:38,445
I'm your guardian fucking angel.
Drive, mother fucker.

662
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:39,581
Whatever.

663
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:52,760
There's a virus out there.
The world... has gone
bug-house.

664
00:49:53,862 --> 00:49:55,663
Tell me about it.

665
00:49:55,697 --> 00:50:03,303
Chinks, fucking eating monkey
brains. They found an elephant
with syphilis.

666
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:07,040
Who in their right mind
would fuck an elephant?

667
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:09,042
There goes my Friday night.

668
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:11,746
I got it, I got it. Listen...

669
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:15,115
If somebody was to fuck
an elephant...
You know, I
could put on some music...

670
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,852
The right person for
that job is Crate!

671
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:19,353
Yeah, Crate is right-as-rain.

672
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:22,055
Yeah, you're lucky.
- Oh, yeah? How's that?

673
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:28,663
Crate... Takes care of his
own... Took care of me
when I was in prison.

674
00:50:28,696 --> 00:50:30,732
You were in prison?

675
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:33,100
Never thought twice.

676
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,102
What were you in for?

677
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:40,107
Doesn't fucking matter.
Telling you,
your dad's a fucking saint, kid.

678
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:42,911
He's not my dad.

679
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:48,683
He's not your fucking dad?
That's fucking cold,
kid. Ice cold. Fuck.

680
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:51,118
You should probably work on
that fucking attitude.

681
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:53,153
Yeah! You're probably right!

682
00:50:54,789 --> 00:51:01,295
You know, it's all right.
I'd do anything
for fucking Crate. Fuck you.

683
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:36,731
So, Massimo. How's this go?

684
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:38,533
Grab the stuff.

685
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:39,534
Yeah.

686
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,603
Go to the unit.

687
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:46,373
And then? - That's it.

688
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:48,208
Is it?

689
00:51:52,245 --> 00:51:54,214
What's the supposed to mean?

690
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:57,018
- I mean, you're out here
all day. - So?

691
00:51:57,051 --> 00:52:01,689
So, four to six hours is a long
time. It costs us money, kid.

692
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:04,592
It's a full tank out
here. I gotta eat.

693
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,260
And that's it?

694
00:52:08,362 --> 00:52:14,902
You want a fucking inventory, or
something? Like a manifest? Like
I'm some fucking trucker,
or something?!

695
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:18,106
You need to calm down,
sweetheart.

696
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,974
Fuck!

697
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:24,846
Fucking cunt.

698
00:52:30,018 --> 00:52:30,985
Cigarette?

699
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:32,654
Nah, man.

700
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,425
...Fuck.

701
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:51,806
Yeah, I remember this place.
16-years-old, doing
runs through here.

702
00:52:52,640 --> 00:53:00,347
Young, dumb, and full of
cum. Right over there.
Used to be a whorehouse.
Everything legal.

703
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,215
You could do anything.

704
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:04,152
You think that's
what's going on?

705
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,953
You tell me I'm wrong.

706
00:53:09,157 --> 00:53:12,627
Haha! Ha...! You got me!

707
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,163
Yeah, boy.

708
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:17,364
Guilty as charged.

709
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:19,901
You like that freaky-deaky
shit, huh?

710
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:22,637
Freaky-deaky.

711
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:25,573
That explains the get-up.

712
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,846
They got a pill for that
these days, young man.

713
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:42,322
So who's your favorite?

714
00:53:45,093 --> 00:53:46,928
Favorite?

715
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:50,665
Everybody's got a
favorite bitch.

716
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:51,866
Candy.

717
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:55,737
Candy... Sounds sweet.

718
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:58,472
She was.

719
00:53:58,506 --> 00:54:00,541
Was?

720
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:05,445
Not gonna see her anymore.

721
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:15,556
Well... She sounds like one
stacked pancake. She
look anything like this?

722
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:21,095
How did you get those?

723
00:54:21,129 --> 00:54:24,098
Cuz, cocksucker. That's
my fucking job.

724
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:26,100
Listen...

725
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:28,268
We know you've been
tasting, kid.

726
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:29,871
No, I don't.

727
00:54:30,538 --> 00:54:33,040
No... you don't? - Nope.

728
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:35,510
No, you don't
take a taste?

729
00:54:35,543 --> 00:54:36,309
No.

730
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:38,946
You stupid fucking cocksucker!

731
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:43,184
Are you fucking telling
me you don't
fucking taste?!
- No, sir!

732
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:44,986
Look at me, you fucking
little junkie!

733
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:49,624
You think I'm a clown like you?!
Huh? You think I'm a fucking
clown? I see the

734
00:54:49,657 --> 00:54:54,294
track marks on your fucking
arm...! Huh?!

735
00:54:57,999 --> 00:55:04,272
You think I can't smell
the cancer? - The
fuck did you just say, weirdo?

736
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:06,541
You got a year... tops.

737
00:55:06,574 --> 00:55:09,110
Fuck you, you little cocksucker!

738
00:55:09,143 --> 00:55:11,646
The fuck you think you
are, you fucking

739
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,714
piece of shit!

740
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:22,957
Hahaha! Look at you , motherfucker.
Your dad was too much
of a pussy to do what
needed to be done.

741
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,027
Not me, motherfucker.
Good night.

742
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:29,197
Christ!

743
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,330
You fucking bit me,
you cocksucker!

744
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,368
Goddamn. Fucking homo.
You fucking bit me?!

745
00:55:35,703 --> 00:55:37,038
What the fuck?

746
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,007
Queer fucking bit me.

747
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:50,051
Fucking cocksucker.

748
00:56:18,145 --> 00:56:22,817
Shhh... shhh, it's okay.

749
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:26,453
Tien? Are you here?

750
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,364
All right.
- Are you here?

751
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,633
For now.

752
00:56:41,135 --> 00:56:45,172
I can't see. - I know.
It's gonna be okay.

753
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:49,944
What is that smell...? Oh, god.

754
00:56:49,977 --> 00:57:00,621
What did I do? What is that smell? Oh,
my god. What did I do? Oh, shit.
Oh, god. Someone, please,
someone help me.

755
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:07,662
Well, it is about time for you
to lay in your native soil.

756
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,365
Shhh. I'm right here.

757
00:57:11,399 --> 00:57:13,134
Stop it!

758
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:14,101
What?

759
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:15,937
You're not her.

760
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:38,352
- What the fuck is this?
- It's calming.

761
00:58:38,386 --> 00:58:40,955
Well, aren't you hot
shit? I can't see

762
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:43,624
fuck all in here.

763
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:52,299
I gotta use the can.
Where's it at?

764
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:55,669
Yo! Earth to fuck-head.

765
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:58,406
I heard you. - Then
you know what to do.

766
00:58:58,439 --> 00:59:01,008
What's that? - Answer me.

767
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:03,010
I did.

768
00:59:03,044 --> 00:59:04,445
You didn't say shit.

769
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:06,714
And that was my answer.

770
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:09,550
Fuck you.

771
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:10,785
You got eyes.

772
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:14,088
No, you answer me when
I talk to you.

773
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:15,489
Piss yourself.

774
00:59:15,524 --> 00:59:16,490
How's that?

775
00:59:16,525 --> 00:59:18,259
You do it all the time anyway.

776
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:20,061
Say that again. Say it again!

777
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:22,630
Kidney's aren't what
they used to be.

778
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,935
You son of a bitch.

779
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:30,438
Lot of blood in that piss.

780
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:31,605
How'd you know that?

781
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:33,908
You oughta
get that checked.

782
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:38,312
I oughta kill you.

783
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,048
I'd like to see you try.

784
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:54,028
Look at this place.
Fucking pigsty.

785
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:04,939
So who's this tough fuck?
You know, when you
were a kid, you had
some respect.

786
01:00:04,972 --> 01:00:06,841
Kids are stupid.

787
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:13,180
No. Kids listen. They understand.
Jesus, Mary,
and Joseph. I mean, have
you learned nothing?

788
01:00:13,214 --> 01:00:14,448
Not a goddamn thing.

789
01:00:14,482 --> 01:00:16,117
That just makes me
tired all over.

790
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:19,220
- Guess you wasted your
time. - Did I?

791
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:22,156
- Besides that was a lifetime
ago. - Not to me.

792
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:23,424
Cause you're old.

793
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:25,259
- See, what is that?
- What?

794
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:28,530
This smart-ass, piss-poor
mouth of yours.

795
01:00:28,563 --> 01:00:29,897
New me, I guess.

796
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,166
How can you be so arrogant?
I gave you everything.

797
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:34,702
- You didn't give me shit.
- Your whole life.

798
01:00:34,735 --> 01:00:36,871
Get in line. - I made you.

799
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:39,340
Didn't do a very good job.

800
01:00:39,373 --> 01:00:40,708
That breaks my heart.

801
01:00:40,741 --> 01:00:43,144
Nah, I think the cholesterol
will take care of that.

802
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:46,780
Shut up! What I do is
between me and God!

803
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:49,450
And the DNA of the 53
women you fucked...

804
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,452
54, if this new blonde
works out.

805
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:55,256
What is this psychic shit, man?
Where are you getting this?

806
01:00:55,289 --> 01:01:00,694
Look, how would you like it
if I told you something
that you don't want to hear.
Thrill me.

807
01:01:00,728 --> 01:01:02,997
About your mom. - My mom?

808
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:06,734
She sleeps next to me
every night. Okay?

809
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:09,470
And I got all the numbers,
all the addresses.

810
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,671
Good for you.

811
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:12,673
Including that little
piece. Tien.

812
01:01:12,706 --> 01:01:14,208
You think
that's leverage?

813
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:15,577
I got more.

814
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,077
I'm shaking.

815
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:21,215
Yeah, you should be... Tien
know about your moonlighting?

816
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:23,284
Oh, you mean the whore.

817
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,286
I bet she doesn't.

818
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,787
So tell her.

819
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,558
Just like that?
Doesn't mean shit to me.

820
01:01:30,124 --> 01:01:33,327
I'm not buying it. No, that's
not gonna cut it.

821
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,797
Not trying to cut it.
- You can't protect her.

822
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,099
I don't care.

823
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:42,369
Don't try to poker face me.
You don't have the face.

824
01:01:43,304 --> 01:01:44,471
One call. One text.

825
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:47,107
I press one button, and those
two are best friends.

826
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:49,009
You act like you're talking
to Messy Massimo

827
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:52,514
right now... Everything's
changed.

828
01:01:53,347 --> 01:01:55,883
Just like that?
- All bets are off.

829
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:59,386
I don't believe that.
In fact, if I was you

830
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,222
I'd be pissing myself.

831
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:02,890
I'd be fucking shaking.

832
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:13,934
You got nothing.

833
01:02:13,968 --> 01:02:21,108
And what do you got? What's
with this attitude? You got
an ace up your sleeve?

834
01:02:23,377 --> 01:02:25,112
sleeve

835
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:30,851
Is she here? That's it, isn't
it? Son-of-a-bitch.

836
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:33,053
Tien...? Tien?!

837
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:37,458
Hold it!

838
01:02:38,225 --> 01:02:39,326
Cute.

839
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,395
Get over there.

840
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:48,737
So now what?

841
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:54,141
What was that?

842
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,210
Just marking my territory.

843
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:58,546
This was meant to be a social
call. All right?

844
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,881
Nice and civil.
- With a gun.

845
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,520
Is that how you took care
of my associate?

846
01:03:05,553 --> 01:03:06,854
The hit man?

847
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:09,423
It was a friendly conversation.

848
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:11,492
Also with a gun.

849
01:03:25,906 --> 01:03:27,908
So what happened to him?

850
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:29,778
Like you said. All friendly.

851
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:30,878
What happened to Gage?

852
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:33,147
Gage had it coming.

853
01:03:34,749 --> 01:03:38,520
Look, I put my ass on the line
for you for 20 fucking years.

854
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:39,554
That's just the blink of an eye.

855
01:03:39,587 --> 01:03:41,088
I went into the arena

856
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:44,191
over and over. I was
your gladiator.
Gladiators die.

857
01:03:44,224 --> 01:03:46,460
You could've been a Made Man.

858
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,899
But now...

859
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:55,469
You're just an asshole.

860
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:58,540
You're the one who sent Gage.

861
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:01,208
Believe me... I didn't
want that.

862
01:04:01,975 --> 01:04:08,215
But you got sloppy. Now, I'm
gonna make a deal with
you. Same deal I made
with your Dad.

863
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:16,725
You're gonna walk out that
door. You're gonna go down
to Mexico, and you're gonna
never come back.

864
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:27,201
No calls. No contact. Just
gone forever, all
right? Otherwise, you're
gone forever.

865
01:04:32,272 --> 01:04:33,474
Just like that?

866
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:41,348
You disappear. -In a puff of
smoke, poof. What's your
answer? -Fly away on
leathery wings.

867
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:43,350
Don't be an idiot.

868
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:49,524
What deal did my Dad take?

869
01:04:54,863 --> 01:05:01,368
Bet I can grab that gun
faster than you... No.
Here. Put your hand out.

870
01:05:01,402 --> 01:05:03,671
You're a dumb shit.

871
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:15,182
One... - Don't
make me do this.

872
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:16,885
Oh, I'm gonna
get the gun.

873
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:17,786
Oh, you think so?

874
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:19,953
It's what it is... Two...

875
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,756
I never liked you.

876
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,557
THREE!

877
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:28,763
Chewy.

878
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:33,601
No, no, no, no! No!

879
01:05:33,635 --> 01:05:34,669
Relax.

880
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:36,538
What did you do? - A favor.

881
01:05:36,571 --> 01:05:39,674
Oh, my god! - He
was going to kill you.

882
01:05:39,707 --> 01:05:40,775
He killed your father.

883
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:41,910
You're lying!

884
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:44,546
You know, it's true...
You can hear it.

885
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:47,582
No, no, no.

886
01:05:47,615 --> 01:05:49,183
The voices.

887
01:05:49,216 --> 01:05:51,586
Stop it!

888
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:56,791
The transformation is complete.

889
01:05:56,825 --> 01:05:59,861
Get out of my head!

890
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:09,036
What're you doing?

891
01:06:09,069 --> 01:06:11,338
It's over.

892
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:14,876
No! We're the last ones!

893
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,583
You need me.

894
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:28,121
You need me.

895
01:06:38,265 --> 01:06:41,435
I'll take my chances.

896
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:08,328
You know...

897
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:14,936
Your blood is as good
as gold to me.

898
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:17,471
Maybe the most precious
thing in the world.

899
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:24,846
But I think I'm just gonna
let it run out.

900
01:07:31,586 --> 01:07:34,556
Because I'm done taking
anything from you.

901
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:44,566
You're nothing but a waste.

902
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:47,869
Massimo?

903
01:07:47,902 --> 01:07:49,102
Hey, babe.

904
01:07:49,136 --> 01:07:49,871
Where are you?

905
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:51,071
Home, sweet home.

906
01:07:51,104 --> 01:07:52,372
Are you alone?

907
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:53,307
For now.

908
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,976
Okay, great. Stay there.
I'm coming over.

909
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:57,712
I'm not going anywhere.
There's
something I gotta tell you.

910
01:08:00,515 --> 01:08:01,849
It's your funeral.

911
01:08:20,233 --> 01:08:23,203
Where are you?

912
01:08:24,072 --> 01:08:25,439
What's the matter?

913
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:28,442
Nothing, I... - You
waiting for an invitation?

914
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:35,984
You did that all by yourself.
That's good, I think.

915
01:08:36,017 --> 01:08:41,856
Massy... You okay?
- Never better.

916
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:48,428
You want, um, You want something
to drink? I mean, everything's
kind of laying around here, so... I
mean, I tell ya... It's been hell.

917
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:49,931
No! Nothing! I'm... I'm fine!

918
01:08:49,998 --> 01:08:52,800
And the bottle of Chorazos is
already gone. It's just gone.

919
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,435
I have been so worried
about you.

920
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:58,773
- So you don't want some wine?
- Forget the wine!

921
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:03,578
What's going on...?
Have you been sick?

922
01:09:03,611 --> 01:09:05,880
More or less.

923
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:08,516
Oh, yeah. You feel cold.

924
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:10,417
Do you have any other symptoms?

925
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,486
What're you a doctor now?

926
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,789
Well, ever since you
broke up with me...

927
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:17,725
It's hard for me to focus
on anything else.

928
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,794
Let it go.

929
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:24,866
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said.

930
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:27,334
The text I sent you.

931
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:29,336
Yeah, about the tests.

932
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:31,405
And?

933
01:09:31,438 --> 01:09:37,712
It's gonna be hard for you
to hear, but I went and
I took them. All of them.
There were about ten.

934
01:09:37,745 --> 01:09:40,548
I even took the AIDS test.

935
01:09:40,782 --> 01:09:43,051
And they found... nothing.

936
01:09:54,227 --> 01:09:56,196
That's something.

937
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:58,566
Wait, there's more.

938
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:01,002
You should go.

939
01:10:01,035 --> 01:10:03,270
Just listen to me.

940
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,648
Please, just go.

941
01:10:13,681 --> 01:10:14,481
I'm not leaving.

942
01:10:14,515 --> 01:10:15,449
You're lucky it didn't get you.

943
01:10:15,482 --> 01:10:16,818
You're not listening to me.

944
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:20,154
Stay here and something bad
is gonna happen to you.

945
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:23,858
The hospital... They
ran a DNA test.

946
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:26,127
DNA test?

947
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,664
I gave them some
of your clothes.
They found something
really rare.

948
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:31,666
Holy shit!

949
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:32,700
You can't stay here!

950
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:34,168
Wait! - She's coming.
She's coming...

951
01:10:34,202 --> 01:10:36,369
She's coming... She's
coming... Sofia is...

952
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:38,072
There is no Sofia!

953
01:10:38,106 --> 01:10:39,073
What?!

954
01:10:39,107 --> 01:10:40,074
No, no, you...

955
01:10:40,108 --> 01:10:40,942
Just listen to me.

956
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:42,543
You saw her!

957
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:43,343
When?

958
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:44,812
When she said I couldn't
see you.

959
01:10:44,846 --> 01:10:46,647
There is no Sofia.

960
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:47,481
You talked to her.

961
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:49,851
I was talking to you.

962
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:52,887
What's going on?

963
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:10,805
Get... Get away! Just get away!

964
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:15,977
Honey? Who is that? Who're
you talking to?

965
01:11:18,146 --> 01:11:21,916
Get away, get away, get away.

966
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:25,753
Sofia.

967
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,657
Who are you talking to?

968
01:11:36,097 --> 01:11:38,032
Who are you?

969
01:11:38,065 --> 01:11:43,938
Um... I'm Tien... Who are you?

970
01:11:44,437 --> 01:11:50,812
Who are you...? Who are you...?
There's... she's, um...

971
01:11:52,814 --> 01:11:54,849
She's...

972
01:11:56,851 --> 01:12:01,421
Tien, there's something...
There's
something I need to tell you.

973
01:12:01,454 --> 01:12:05,827
I was talking to you,
Massy. We were on the
phone. You were talking
to no one. There was

974
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,563
no one there. You were
talking to no one.

975
01:12:08,596 --> 01:12:10,397
But that's not what happened.

976
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,866
You don't remember?

977
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:13,201
I saw... I saw...

978
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:14,268
What did you see?

979
01:12:14,302 --> 01:12:16,771
There... there was
this creature.

980
01:12:18,606 --> 01:12:20,107
What?

981
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:28,649
I won't let it take you.

982
01:12:28,683 --> 01:12:30,585
Massy...

983
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:31,752
Where did you see this creature?

984
01:12:31,786 --> 01:12:33,955
I can't remember.
I can't remember.

985
01:12:33,988 --> 01:12:35,756
I can't remember.

986
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:38,726
I can't remember,
I can't remember,
I can't remember.

987
01:12:38,759 --> 01:12:40,862
I can't... I can't remember.
I can't remember.

988
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:42,930
It happened that night.

989
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:55,142
When we made love.

990
01:12:55,309 --> 01:13:04,819
Yes, yes. That's it...
We were in bed. We
started talking about
the Penanggalan.

991
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:08,689
Crate knew my Dad.

992
01:13:08,856 --> 01:13:12,627
Helped set me up. Odd
jobs, here and there.

993
01:13:16,664 --> 01:13:19,300
Hey... what's... what's wrong?

994
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:22,103
Hey... what's going on...?
What's the matter?

995
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:23,436
Baby?!

996
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,306
Are you okay?!

997
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:29,277
What's going on? Babe!
Are you okay?!

998
01:13:44,025 --> 01:13:47,061
Baby, what's going on?

999
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:48,763
What's wrong?!

1000
01:14:28,602 --> 01:14:33,741
You disassociated for an hour.

1001
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:35,609
I did?

1002
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:41,015
You didn't remember anything,
like nothing
had ever happened.

1003
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:45,186
But then... we were
good for a while.

1004
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:07,508
And then that Sofia thing
started happening.

1005
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,084
Break it off.

1006
01:15:17,118 --> 01:15:17,985
What?

1007
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:18,486
You heard me.

1008
01:15:20,221 --> 01:15:21,255
You can't be serious.

1009
01:15:21,288 --> 01:15:23,257
This is not open to discussion.

1010
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:26,394
Fuck you!

1011
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:30,097
I'm so sorry, Tien.
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:15:30,131 --> 01:15:31,632
Shhh, it's not your fault.

1013
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:33,534
Don't you see it?
She is playing you.

1014
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,403
For the money.
For my money!

1015
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:38,439
I had to protect you.

1016
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,142
Oh, god...

1017
01:15:50,151 --> 01:15:52,319
You know, I found out
about your father.

1018
01:15:52,353 --> 01:15:57,625
He went to Mexico... he's dead.

1019
01:15:57,658 --> 01:16:00,094
I know. I'm sorry.

1020
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,297
You're gonna walk out that door.
You're gonna go down to Mexico.

1021
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:06,100
You're gone forever.

1022
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:07,536
Crate killed him.

1023
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:10,271
No, no, no...

1024
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:12,273
He died in a hospital.

1025
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,341
What...? What?

1026
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:18,946
He must've found out he had
the same thing you did.

1027
01:16:20,781 --> 01:16:22,883
What're you talking about?

1028
01:16:22,917 --> 01:16:26,487
It's a rare genetic disease.

1029
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:28,422
No... no...

1030
01:16:28,456 --> 01:16:34,428
It affects the nervous system.
Causes hallucinations.
Blackouts. It's hereditary.

1031
01:16:34,462 --> 01:16:36,764
Hereditary?!

1032
01:16:36,797 --> 01:16:41,602
He must've been trying to find
a cure. That's why he left.
They didn't know what it
was about back then.

1033
01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:49,777
All the things I've seen, they
were just... Oh, my god!

1034
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:53,848
Don't you see? None of
this is your fault.

1035
01:16:53,881 --> 01:16:55,584
You were born with it!

1036
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:56,984
Everything I've done!

1037
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:59,153
But you haven't done anything.

1038
01:16:59,186 --> 01:17:01,155
Oh, my god...

1039
01:17:03,824 --> 01:17:09,897
You take these pills. You
take them twice a day.
They stop the hallucinations.
You don't have to

1040
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:12,066
live this way. There's a cure.

1041
01:17:14,502 --> 01:17:16,737
There's no cure!

1042
01:17:17,905 --> 01:17:21,742
Baby... I'm not going anywhere.

1043
01:17:26,515 --> 01:17:28,849
Nice try... you cunt!

1044
01:17:28,883 --> 01:17:30,284
Ahh!

1045
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:33,522
I'm gonna kill you.

1046
01:17:33,555 --> 01:17:36,390
It's... not... real.

1047
01:17:36,423 --> 01:17:37,626
Stop it!

1048
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:40,261
You're not Tien! You're
not Tien!

1049
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:42,329
Please...

1050
01:17:42,997 --> 01:17:43,898
...stop...

1051
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:47,334
I'm gonna rip your
fucking face off!

1052
01:17:54,576 --> 01:17:57,178
Oh, my god.

1053
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:12,793
I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

1054
01:18:15,896 --> 01:18:25,406
I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

1055
01:18:29,343 --> 01:18:35,517
I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

1056
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:39,554
It's okay. It's okay.

1057
01:18:39,588 --> 01:18:41,822
You're just sick.

1058
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:46,827
You're just sick.
