1
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

2
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:17,001
Almost unprepared, make up by the afternoon of life.

3
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,000
Worse than that. We step with false assumptions

4
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,500
the truths and ideals

5
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:29,004
How should we serve.

6
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,005
But we could live life afternoon

7
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,006
according to the schedule of morning life.

8
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,007
Because what was great in the morning will become tiny evening.

9
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:47,008
And what was true in the morning, the evening will become a lie.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hay House presents:

11
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:56,629
Dr. Wayne W. Dyer in

12
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,010
From ambition to meaning - Discovering your life purpose

13
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:08,011
Hey. -Hey. Thank you, dear.

14
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,500
Wait, can you give me some milk?

15
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:13,013
Sure

16
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:20,014
Sorry, I have not seen. Thank you

17
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:31,005
OK, I packed everything, to get some snacks, do not forget Jason's recipe, dog,

18
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,016
machine rate, I called neighbors

19
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, Jack!

20
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,018
Jack

21
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:45,009
Jack, I need to turn off the game and came down to eat. We will leave shortly.

22
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,020
Mommy, let me just finish this level.

23
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,500
Okay, very good. But then we will disconnect all the weekend, right?

24
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:55,022
I do not know what "off".

25
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,023
It's a very strange life forms |

26
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Hey, sweetie.

27
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,004
It's time to wake up, baby.

28
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:11,005
Already it tomorrow?

29
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes, it's already tomorrow! And we go on vacation, and we enjoy the most,

30
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,027
But we should avoid traffic, so let! It's time to wake up, monkey.dance!

31
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,028
Ok, up!

32
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:39,029
Exaggerate, Larry, do not know what they can do.

33
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,030
-Can do more harm your image, Chad. Listen,

34
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,500
of a brand to protect, Dead Development can not afford to have processes

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,032
with a group of environmentalists. Ä, lies not simply the right climate for such things.

36
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,723
And what do you propose?

37
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:57,034
-I suggest you think of a type of compromise or it will lead to court

38
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,005
and you can not start this project at all.

39
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,036
Why did not this happen when I made impact report? In the name of God, it's a tree!

40
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,037
No, it's more than a tree.

41
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:10,500
Chad, your sales drop and now you feel that you are insensitive.

42
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:12,508
Are insensitive, it's a tree!

43
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,026
Me esta costando ¡³ n Dinero a mount ..

44
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:16,375
-You know what, Larry, talk about it after-

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,001
Wait a minute ..

46
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:19,662
Minute charge me, I now close .-

47
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:20,137
Not yet ...

48
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,900
About what was all this?

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,975
Are falling by 80% to commission approval.

50
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:27,630
Why can not you simply do not build near the tree?

51
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,123
Because I lose money and you do not receive your bonus.

52
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,440
I will not reconfigure a whole section because of a tree.

53
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,059
No matter, then.

54
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Have you taken any decision in relation to the board meeting at the weekend that the Monterrey?

55
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:40,001
Wait, what it is?

56
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,212
"House of Hope and Promise"

57
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,401
Ah, next time someone asks me to be in one of these boards, shoot me!

58
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,189
Jhonson Hugh will be there, remember?

59
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,191
I turned on one relationship that you may ask to participate.

60
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:53,249
Yes, yes, if Hugh Jhonson is on the board would do well to be myself.

61
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,059
In case you forgot, in rehabilitation centers of the House of Hope

62
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
families are homeless.

63
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:59,200
I have put all the information in this file.

64
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,062
You can put yourself up to date about their mission in the car on the road.

65
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:06,063
I already know what is their mission: to give them a helping hand to those who can not help themselves.

66
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,255
You know what? I am not one no hand stretched out and I did well.

67
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:13,219
I'll call and I will suggest your journalists to say something about your charity work.

68
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,749
Yes, this really is a good idea.

69
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,749
I'll deviate from the whole problem with this tree.

70
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,067
That's what I thought too.

71
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,068
...

72
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,600
- Wait!

73
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:23,417
Good! Yes? What happened?

74
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,017
You hear a little hard.

75
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,070
The reception is not good up here.

76
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,905
What do you mean by "reconsider her"?

77
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:33,450
Are you kidding, is not it?

78
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:37,072
Though my agent ...

79
00:07:38,073 --> 00:07:41,073
-Too violent? And that means even you?

80
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,274
No, I do not make movies odious,

81
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,800
I make horror movies, you must convince them that.

82
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:50,075
They know even as we invested in that talent?

83
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:56,076
Ah, you have to find a way to make ...

84
00:07:57,507 --> 00:08:00,077
Look, he appeared directly in the eyes looked at me,

85
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,078
and said: "This is a project of gold, I want to make your film"

86
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,571
Yes! Because if money does not come we will have

87
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,080
many problems trying to find another investor.

88
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,081
I thought it was something safe - I beg your pardon, you see that pass.

89
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:15,082
Want to make me happy? Do get money for my film,

90
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,300
That would make me happy.

91
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:20,083
I have to go, are in this thing with Wayne Dyer. Pa.

92
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:23,084
Wow, damn!

93
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,946
It's something we can do?

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,075
You, more or less, 5 million?

95
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,807
If I had it I would be here?

96
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:27,600
Then I do not think you can help me.

97
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,089
Cheer up David, it's a good job, it's fast! It's fast and fun.

98
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
It's 6.30 am, Sarah, will not be fun.

99
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,900
It's just a job.

100
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:39,007
One or two questions, we draw some pictures and then get out of here ..

101
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,092
Wayne!

102
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,943
Good morning, David! - What are you doing? - Great!

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,954
I hope it's not too early for you.

104
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,195
Oh no! I'm awake for hours.

105
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,096
Okay, okay! He is Rob, our cameraman, we very lucky to have.

106
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:49,497
Ron, sound technician.

107
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:50,417
Hi, Ron! Pleased to meet you.

108
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:54,017
And it is Sarah, my coordinator production, full of resources.

109
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:55,908
If you need anything, just ask for them!

110
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:56,500
-Very well.

111
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,709
So if you do not mind, I thought we could turn

112
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,100
area by more social and we set there.

113
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,600
Sure, I'm ready. I am ready for a few hours.

114
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,102
Ok, take your coat and go.

115
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:06,900
- Super! -

116
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:11,104
After you, Doc. Well, how did you sleep?

117
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,905
-I slept very well, we are very excited that this is

118
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,600
Oh, you have no expectation that I should know?

119
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:21,007
I have no hold. Are entirely in your hands, whatever you want to do ...

120
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:22,608
Oh, I'm sorry for you, Dr. Dyer.

121
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm sorry you said it ..

122
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,510
I just want to cover a little here, otherwise your head will shine.

123
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,901
You can not go wrong with this place, it's not nice?

124
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,452
It is beautiful here.

125
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,603
I'm kind of allergic to nature.

126
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:36,514
Oh, I love her. I am so excited to be here.

127
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:40,115
It seems well .- Several trees, fewer trees, how do you find?

128
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Sure, it's good.

129
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,717
Do you know anything about the history of this place? You searched some information somewhere?

130
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:47,318
Not really, just go where we send, you know?

131
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,019
Leading this place is a fascinating guy,

132
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,120
History of the place told me ...

133
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,121
-I can not hear-

134
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,022
... Is truly a magical place and ..

135
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:55,523
-Can you say that again? Excuse

136
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:57,800
I said it was magical, a magical place

137
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:58,500
- I hear, I hear-.

138
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:02,026
In 1913, Julia Morgan, an architect,

139
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,600
-AHA-

140
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
She thought the whole complex design.

141
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:05,529
He was conceived as a conference center for the Division

142
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,130
Western YWCA and they held their meetings here all.

143
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,031
And the name of the place is "Asilomar"

144
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,400
Who knows what Asilomar? And I asked and said to me:

145
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,003
"Asilio Asilo or refuge means" apple "means the sea"

146
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,004
Look, if we can start.

147
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,900
That's interesting, you heard, David?

148
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:24,300
I heard, yes.

149
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:28,300
Ä, be it a refuge by the sea, is, is simply stunning, so beautiful,

150
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,950
-Great-

151
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:29,400
are so excited to be here.

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,959
Wayne, just to know, tomorrow and tomorrow you will have to ask ..

153
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,630
and you will answer,

154
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:37,156
and then we will change locations and do the same thing again.

155
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,232
And also, we will shoot something for Part B, in the following days.

156
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,433
Would you like a bee? (Pun)

157
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:43,034
Yes, part B, the film ..

158
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:45,335
Bees .. shoot bees?

159
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:49,737
Listen, it's your vision, I am open to anything.

160
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:52,538
Whatever what you see, I am happy to go on your idea.

161
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,339
Well, rather I am a technician in the present.

162
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,040
Seriously? Well, you know what? Maybe you learned something.

163
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,441
Maybe .. Well, I'm open to that.

164
00:10:59,642 --> 00:10:59,842
Great!

165
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,543
Ahh .. You can start and to start the camera.

166
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:04,144
We are ready.

167
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:05,645
The sound is good.

168
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,546
Very well, Sarah, you can be nice and let us cut?

169
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:09,347
I would like more

170
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:10,102
I will crop?

171
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:11,449
I'll cut in Regulation

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Dr. Dyer, an interview.

173
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:18,300
Okay, Wayne, you came up here to write your last book.

174
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:20,900
Can you tell us something about the subject of this book?

175
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:24,943
Yes, I would like. One of the things that
I was intrigued over the years

176
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,554
is that so many people say when I talk about the purpose

177
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:31,620
and about finding meaning in their life is ..

178
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,106
"What is my purpose? How can I find?

179
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,870
I always seem to escape, it seems that I'll never find .. "

180
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:40,208
I always felt that the true purpose of life

181
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:43,194
just to be happy, to enjoy your life.

182
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,500
To arrive in a place where ...

183
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,392
... Do not always try to go elsewhere.

184
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,502
So many people spend their lives struggling, trying to be

185
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:53,903
in a place where there are. It seems that they never get there.

186
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,664
One of the forms to understand how to find your

187
00:11:56,865 --> 00:12:00,000
Your purpose in life is to go back to nature.

188
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,800
To find your own nature.

189
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,400
I wrote a book several years ago called:

190
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,100
Change your thoughts, change your life!

191
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,700
based on the teachings of Lao Tzu's ancient,

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,500
from a book called the Tao Te Ching.

193
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,743
Lao Tzu reminds us that all the being of existence has its origin

194
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:18,000
Jesus said such in the New Testament:

195
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,800
It is the spirit that gives life

196
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,000
you did not really come from your parents,

197
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:26,500
that we all came from this place called Spirit.

198
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,000
That when you came into this world,

199
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:33,637
have emerged from a tiny drop of human protoplasm.

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,400
A grain, if you want. And everything in that little grain

201
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,600
You became. Everything you needed was in that little grain.

202
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,185
One of the most important metaphors
you've ever used is

203
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,239
that the first nine months of your life, from conception of your

204
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:53,000
your birth until everything was arranged for you.

205
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,000
There was nothing to do for you. You should not concern
thinking about what color your eyes will be,

206
00:12:56,354 --> 00:13:00,500
or how you show your body. They take care of everything.

207
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,772
You just quit. I call it the pillar of the future.

208
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:07,300
And you shoot, you pull in the direction

209
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:09,500
it is supposed to be.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,180
And I did not seem exaggerated to say that everything you needed for your physical journey

211
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,109
was already set in there.

212
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,939
And then why not the rest of the journey, too?

213
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,850
Your goal is in there.

214
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,619
Everything you your personality is in there.

215
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,191
All that is to be, not only physical self, but everything.

216
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:29,864
If you just leave and permits.

217
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,395
And so we are born.
And look at this beautiful little creature, as parents,

218
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,936
I have eight children, I saw this many times-

219
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:41,250
and look at this beautiful little boy, you look and say:

220
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,895
Great job, O Lord, great job. He could not be better

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,540
We take care from now on

222
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,400
And then we are surrounded by all these people,
Our family, our culture wherever we go.

223
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,801
And begins to be told

224
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,321
that we can not really trust what we are.

225
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:05,003
We must trust in something outside ourselves

226
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:08,504
and travel to this ambition. And once you start to say:

227
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:11,550
We take care from now on, enter something ..

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,266
simply take this .. perfection

229
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:18,622
and out of the way the Creator, (Edge God Out).

230
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:22,208
E G A ego

231
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,853
The ego is part of us that told us he

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,150
Is not that who you are created perfect, divine,
piece of God that you came.

233
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:35,704
Do not say that. We say: you are what you have.

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,726
Start with things like our toys and our bank accounts and then

235
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:43,000
and then in our possession possessions. Before we realize

236
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,920
begin to identify ourselves
based on our possessions.

237
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,725
We begin to have a set of beliefs such as:

238
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:53,306
The more I have, the more valuable are the person

239
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:57,120
And so we waste the lives of these young children taking

240
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,654
and throwing them in a culture
which focuses on .. MORE.

241
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,809
Becomes almost a mantra of ego:

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,200
You must have more. And the more you have,

243
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:12,614
are much more aware of how others
want to take what you have.

244
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,662
The more you eat of: How to protect what we have?

245
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:18,360
and How to do more of what I?

246
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:21,454
The dilemma here is that if you are what you

247
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,549
and things disappear,

248
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,426
then what you are disappearing at the same time.

249
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,927
Going somewhere?

250
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:33,640
Yes, I thought I could come with you.

251
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Why?

252
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,500
Why not?

253
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:40,201
Because that's the job of service.
I'll be in meetings all day tomorrow

254
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:42,600
not gonna have nothing to do.

255
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,193
No matter if you're busy, we will go
shopping or something. I'll handle it.

256
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:50,917
Good! Sorry, you will not need you after all.
Thank you leave.

257
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,755
What are you doing?

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,202
Come on! It will be beautiful walk away.
The machine to take?

259
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,100
Not living and do not want to drive. I want someone to lead
because I have work to do.

260
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Ok, I'll lead me.

261
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,650
Take the Porsche!

262
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,687
Denise, where work is not the kind of
place which are ordinary rustic.

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,352
I think I can handle this, Chad. I know to cope with difficult situations.

264
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,602
You know, just do not understand the sudden desire
to spend time together.

265
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:22,323
I just want to escape.

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
Would you rather I take a separate room?

267
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:26,500
Ok, what's not okay with you?

268
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,800
Or interrupt something ..

269
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,700
Oh, come on!

270
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,758
You meet someone there?

271
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,364
Of course not! Look, I do not want to go to this thing.

272
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,100
Well, then .. yet another reason why you should go with you.

273
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,100
No bags to lump all those in Porsche.

274
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,562
Why not help me to try?

275
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,200
The second aspect of the ego that is the idea that
not only what we have, but what they are

276
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,000
We ..

277
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,137
An answer?

278
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:01,400
No, no. Please continue!

279
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,200
It's okay, no problem.

280
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,610
Dr. Dyer, want some water or something?

281
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,500
No, no, well ..

282
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,300
One more movie friends. Stop, or what?

283
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,741
Continue to shoot, still shooting.

284
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,100
Please.

285
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,003
So that .. the second component of the ego is not only the idea that

286
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,954
I am what I am, but that is what they do.

287
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,620
And what is this thing called making do.

288
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:32,420
And in all this world that I think are
what do we consume the whole idea that this

289
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,543
my success, my worth, my merit as human beings
is based on how many are.

290
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,300
So you have to make more money, you need to get a promotion, have to compete with everyone

291
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,400
trying to get what I am.
It teaches us that continually;

292
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:50,800
teach our young people learn that when I go to athletics,

293
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,100
The most important thing you can do
is to be number one

294
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,700
And you see we are number one, we are better than any other.

295
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,500
And we consistently found in this notion
competitive again, to believe

296
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,400
that our world is a place where they must compete.
That is what the ego says.

297
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,651
Now, the third aspect is the idea that
are what others think about me.

298
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,600
This is .. is my reputation.

299
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is particularly relevant for
young people were taught that must

300
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,864
to dress as I think others.
And if others do not like you

301
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,750
then something is wrong with you. And if you eat
with all these things, then you have something different every time

302
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,500
when you return. Now, this is particularly
relevant to women.

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,200
And especially their relationship with the family.
Women are often taught in our culture

304
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,635
in our society that the only way you can
to self-realize you is by how you relate to your family,

305
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,510
to you as a daughter, mother to you, to you as a grandmother.

306
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:51,000
And while they are very important and creative aspects of life of every woman, if this is the choice you make,

307
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,900
represents not necessarily the only solution.

308
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,100
And many women feel their depth
that have a calling to do something great,

309
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,500
to contribute. And often leaves aside.
So what I encourage them to think women are:

310
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,200
Do not ignore that call within you!

311
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,100
Do not ignore that part of you that says:
"You come here to create something important."

312
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,300
And you just so much influence in this, so much as a right to do so, like everyone else has.

313
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,551
Sure, I saw myself on that.

314
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,300
Do you think I could get the entire collection on DVD?

315
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:26,500
I think it could be a possibility.

316
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:28,465
Do you know which is my favorite episode?

317
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:29,500
No, I do not know.

318
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,500
Hit the box!

319
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Ä, be it a good one.

320
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,200
You know, when all the elders become young again.

321
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,939
Yes, yes, it is touching, is not it?

322
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,681
You know? Another episode that I like is when ..

323
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,565
Lord, I would like .. I login,

324
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,315
Oh, oh, I'm sorry!

325
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:45,386
Welcome to the wedding?

326
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:46,104
Ahh .. not

327
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,705
It's a wedding? World even married here?

328
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:50,300
Yes, all the time.

329
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:52,145
Do not criticize, I think it's

330
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,580
delightful.

331
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
Chad Mort.

332
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,800
Development Dead?

333
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:58,100
Yes?

334
00:19:58,912 --> 00:19:59,646
Ethan Lipton

335
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:02,000
I worked for your company.

336
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:03,435
Oh, sure, yes.

337
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:04,763
Accounting.

338
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,703
Yes, sure.

339
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,470
Honey, talk later, ok?

340
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:08,000
Ok.

341
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,960
Oh, make sure you tell the boys to appear
on time tomorrow night at the rehearsal dinner.

342
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,560
Also this weekend will be a continuous celebration of love.

343
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,231
Oh, I love love

344
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:22,500
Well .. of this are in this business .. Goodbye!

345
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:23,823
Next to marry?

346
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:25,953
Oh, no. I'm with the band.

347
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,905
Oh, well. Have a fun weekend .. of love.

348
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:30,725
And you, too!

349
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,327
Remember that guy?

350
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:34,297
Not at all.

351
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,000
Hello

352
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:40,090
Hey, look, I login, the House .. something ..

353
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,601
-Promise and hope-

354
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:41,802
Promise ..

355
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,180
Chad Mort, are driving.

356
00:20:43,304 --> 00:20:44,524
Welcome to Asilomar, Mr. Mort.

357
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,256
We have rooms with views to the north,
out the door and turn left ..

358
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:52,106
Yes, my wife accompanied me suddenly, so that ..
I could have one of the larger rooms?

359
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:53,200
Do not have to say that ..

360
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,000
Well, do not expect, you came unexpectedly ..

361
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,944
-Only one of the nicest rooms would be great. Thank-.

362
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,168
Not used the tent.

363
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:01,169
Haha, camping ..

364
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:02,500
That was funny.

365
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,000
Let me see what I can do for you

366
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,750
There are so many things you can do.

367
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:07,463
Oh, that would be super.

368
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,600
-Chris, where are the children? -

369
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:11,654
Ethan!

370
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,876
Jack, Ethan, come here!

371
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,743
Come.

372
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,200
Come!

373
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:22,456
Go here!

374
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,490
Be careful, soldiers

375
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,515
Come, go to the mother.

376
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:30,005
And .. also something away from all the noise would be good ..

377
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:34,402
We have a 1st floor room in the main building.

378
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:36,100
Something above.

379
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:38,500
Of course, Mr. Mort. You have a room on the 2nd floor.

380
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:39,770
Higher than that, please? ..

381
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,820
I'm afraid this is the highest of what we have here.

382
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Are you kidding. What a waste of space property.

383
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,600
I think you will like this room has balcony.

384
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,600
Sure, if you say ..

385
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:49,600
One moment please ..

386
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,022
Give it your mother, give it your mother, one hurt.

387
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,233
I said that we will disconnect all the weekend.

388
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Want to go home?

389
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,345
No, go home, not fun at all.
Come here, stay with me!

390
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,700
Come, jump on my feet. Jump on your feet .. Ok-

391
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,226
It is impossible to have all meetings
with all these children running and screaming.

392
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,578
Have a pleasant stay!

393
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,708
Look, I do not want to wear this conversation now
Do not have time for this.

394
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,676
I can not worry about that.

395
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,700
We then went to the later parts of the ego,
we talk about something called separation.

396
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,922
The ego has a very strong belief system,
they who are separated from everyone else.

397
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:35,127
And then another component of the ego teaches us
you are also separated from all that I miss

398
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:38,333
in my life and everything I would love to have.

399
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,810
And then, finally, ego teaches us
error most scandalous of all.

400
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,337
It teaches us that .

401
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,847
are separated from God.

402
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,860
And one of the simple concepts that you learn
afternoon of your life when you move

403
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:55,500
the end stage of your life is to realize

404
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,500
you came from a source. We can call God,
can we call it Tao, call no matter how.

405
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:04,200
And that this source is everywhere. There is a place not to be.

406
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:08,051
Must be, because it creates. Everything comes from this source

407
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:10,500
And then you have to be me
If there is any place that is not.

408
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,703
It must be me.

409
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,076
And if they are to me, must also be in any
I think missing from my life.

410
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,100
If you know it, then, somehow, with all that's missing from your life and you would like to have

411
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:29,300
are already connected in spirit. And all you have to do is
to figure out a way where you align yourself

412
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:34,786
with this and have held understanding that you are already connected,
that only need to bring everything on its path.

413
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,000
-This is intense! -

414
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,518
Wow, I said it out loud?

415
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,201
Yes, you just say it loud.

416
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,635
Sorry.

417
00:23:45,203 --> 00:23:46,265
It's all right, is intense.

418
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,000
Nor doubt.

419
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:50,340
Please continue!

420
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:53,292
Ok, I said that as we move
afternoon to life

421
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:57,314
we take the same structures of the ego
I learned that on the morning of our lives.

422
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,158
What are all about competition,
gain, to be better than everyone else.

423
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,089
And try to apply these same structures
afternoon of our lives.

424
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,987
And what happens is that .. ends living a lie.

425
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,643
Because that was really morning
evening became a lie.

426
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,197
The problem is that not really know how
Moving in the end stage of our lives.

427
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,293
Here is where we must learn to ..
we returned to those first nine months

428
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,516
from our conception until birth.

429
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,965
Lao Tzu talks about it in the Tao Te Ching.

430
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,240
Let you lived it!

431
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:38,641
He says that Tao does nothing, yet leaves nothing undone.

432
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:41,391
Here is where to go,
at a point where we can give,

433
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,202
And we know that we are not alone, that we will be guided,

434
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,920
We have a nature and that we can trust in this kind.
It is not something that we must fight all the time.

435
00:24:51,958 --> 00:25:00,120
There is something to turn up in our care. Literally, think about it!
That leaves you lived rather than to take you over.

436
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,333
But as we move towards the end stage of our life,

437
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,543
What happens is that we begin to think of
to meet a dharma,

438
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,044
to fulfill a destiny to fulfill
something within us a call,

439
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,700
that we can only feel within ourselves.
Nobody else can tell you is that,

440
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,500
but if you feel and know, to win or to be above the others go on a background

441
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,400
face to feel old and live your life with a purpose.

442
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,300
Coming to get you!

443
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,100
No! Ethan, do not throw sand!

444
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,080
Hey!

445
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,450
Do you drink?

446
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:58,742
A juice box?

447
00:25:58,903 --> 00:25:59,113
Sure.

448
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:03,834
I'll be back to get some protective lotion.

449
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,700
Are you sure? It's cloudy ..

450
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,336
No, but he can burn.

451
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:10,450
Ok, are you doing?

452
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,892
Let me, I'll be quick.

453
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,280
Are you sure?
We may collect.

454
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,053
No, no, look at them, plays the most.
I do not want to interrupt them.

455
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:19,299
Be right back.

456
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,905
Ok

457
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,500
We have a great material.

458
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,004
Well, I think it was a good start, even was

459
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,775
I think .. I think you see all the work that
tying into some unexpected forms.

460
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:34,696
You'll be surprised really gonna be.

461
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,200
Directors do not like surprises.

462
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,300
A well .. you'll get a few.

463
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,355
Great.

464
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,200
See you in the morning.

465
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I can not wait Thanks for everything, it was great.

466
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:42,100
Thank-thee-

467
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:42,650
Thanks, guys

468
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Hey, Doc, thank you. The pleasure-

469
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,525
See you later

470
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:46,299
Ok, thanks.

471
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,007
See you tomorrow!

472
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:17,218
Amazing, is not it?

473
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,420
Yes, it is.

474
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,369
It seems that stretch each other.

475
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,911
Sorry?

476
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,800
Well .. trees,
seems to lie at each other to achieve.

477
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,981
Yes, you're right. So it seems.

478
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,988
Also this place .. looks like a different painting each day.

479
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,685
You know, you are very lucky to work here.

480
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,974
Hey ..
You want a lollipop?

481
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,480
Pardon?

482
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,199
It's rootbeer, rootbeer you like? (A drink)

483
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,434
Actually, yes.

484
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,000
It's rootbeer with a little liquid.

485
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,991
Thank you!

486
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,002
I love it!
I like everything in this place

487
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,664
About what? What do you like here?

488
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,200
I do not know, is
just

489
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:24,900
is so beautiful that I
.. I can not describe it ..

490
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,506
in words, yes ..

491
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,050
I believe so

492
00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:28,944
I mean ..

493
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,500
words compared to pictures.

494
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Images?

495
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:34,131
Pictures.

496
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,710
No .. do not make it.

497
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,409
I did it once

498
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:51,402
When I was in college, I used to get off the beach
and draw for hours.

499
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,000
Oh, well. It does not matter anyway.

500
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,100
Oh, well.

501
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,010
Hey, Mom!

502
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:08,900
Where were you?

503
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,250
What?

504
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
We have made the cold.

505
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,330
Eat a lollipop?

506
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:15,541
Yes.

507
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,854
Do you have any children?

508
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:19,760
No, I'm sorry.

509
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,322
Oh, it's all right.

510
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,700
Let's go back!

511
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,636
Let's go. Yes.

512
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,365
All right.

513
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,903
Want of the mother?

514
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,645
Do not catch me, to be honest with you.

515
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,900
This really does not surprise any of us, David.

516
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:40,764
Seriously. If I had ambition, what would be done?.

517
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,326
Oh, it is assumed that this was a comment about us?

518
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,400
Give me a napkin, please.

519
00:29:43,453 --> 00:29:44,779
You know what I mean ..

520
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,700
We should simply sit
And wait for things to happen to us? Miraculously?

521
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:50,929
There is nothing wrong in having a bit of magic in life.

522
00:29:50,961 --> 00:29:51,500
You can not trust magic.

523
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,517
In what can I trust is my own will
to make things work.

524
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:58,218
That is my main problem According to Dr. Dyer.

525
00:29:58,351 --> 00:29:59,961
Ok, it's right there. Want to speak more slowly?

526
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,800
I can not hear.

527
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:01,550
Dr. Dyer,

528
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:02,544
Oh, good! -

529
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:03,999
Want to join us? -Sure! With pleasure! -

530
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,709
What are you doing?

531
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:05,130
Great!

532
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,440
-Well-

533
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,600
Chicken is great.

534
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,164
Hmm .. good, good.

535
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,793
So
Dr. Dyer ..

536
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Yes?

537
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,581
Just talking

538
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:14,470
-Yes-

539
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:16,154
about our first interview
and all the things you said.

540
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,989
And .. In fact, David believes that everything is a mess

541
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,000
What?

542
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,470
David! Really?

543
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:26,000
I .. I do not think everything is so .. I mean ..
I am entitled to my own opinion, right?

544
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:28,650
Absolutely! You have the right to own opinion and I respect.

545
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:31,800
And you know what, David? You should not take everything at once, you know?

546
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:34,400
Just get better with time, that's all it takes, you know?

547
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:35,594
As the practice.

548
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:39,870
Eventually, it becomes a form of life.
Start living from a different perspective.

549
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,410
There are .. really a very spiritual person.
I'm too busy!

550
00:30:42,412 --> 00:30:44,294
Yes, spirituality is like a luxury.

551
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,474
That's true, I find it hard to find time to meditate.

552
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,049
Let me ask you this:
you're a person inspired you?

553
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,416
Live an inspired life? Do you feel inspired?

554
00:30:57,264 --> 00:30:59,551
Hmm .. I have no clue.

555
00:30:59,560 --> 00:30:59,835
Really?

556
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,990
Well, let's let's take an example.

557
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,829
Suppose we had here an apple pie
apple I just did.

558
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,929
And this we take a slice apple pie.

559
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:13,840
Take this, take the rest of the pie and put it here
and take this piece and give it to someone, say you give it to you, Ron

560
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,850
And you say, Ron, what is this?

561
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:17,800
Hmm

562
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,400
It is a p..
apple pie?

563
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,432
How do you know that? How do you know that is an apple pie?

564
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,190
Because I came from an apple pie.

565
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,240
So ..

566
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Well, you laugh, but the truth is that
You've made a very profound statement.

567
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:38,800
That everything in the universe must be like that where it came from.
You can never undo an acorn and
not one to bear a rose bush from it.

568
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:44,300
You look at yourself and ask yourself:
where I came from? Who am I? How am I?

569
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:47,300
You know, the place to make decisions
the place where we really are,

570
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,760
our authentic self, we take the ego.

571
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,200
And every time we take our decisions in the ego,
Begin to happen to all sorts of things

572
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:56,600
removes us from finding meaning

573
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:57,319
- So ..- in life.

574
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,308
how do you know if you take
a decision of the higher self?

575
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,800
Measure everything according to how you feel.

576
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:06,400
Are you stressed? Are you anxious? Scared? Angry?

577
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:09,072
I feel good about yourself?
Do you feel that you have a purpose?

578
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,454
Do you feel that your life has any meaning?
When the act

579
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:16,900
the only part of you that is authentic,
Your answer is blessing.

580
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,120
But on the bright side of ambition?

581
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:22,634
That is, are .. I am a filmmaker and if I had ..

582
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:27,140
Ego can not serve me?
That is, if only I would let go with the flow .. no ..

583
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,800
I would never finish a movie!

584
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,704
That's the conclusion you reached
to think that through ego.

585
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,400
In fact, it can even make movies better
If you look at a higher level point.

586
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,185
Imagine yourself as being able to live and work and do everything you do
in this place .. Let's call it dharma.

587
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,200
What is dharma?

588
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,684
Dharma is a spiritual principle involving
there is a purpose for our lives

589
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,642
How a rodent has a dharma,
A bird has a dharma, everything has a purpose.

590
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,180
And when you find yourself living in agreement with that purpose,

591
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,200
you have found your dharma. Dharma is something that you know ...

592
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,030
something that you live by.

593
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,900
And, rather than ..

594
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:09,730
.. constantly to use ego, will begin
I'm here to tell,

595
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:12,000
I call it a calling, a call is internal.

596
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,950
And you know who is your dharma?
And if you can not even find your dharma?

597
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, if I can not even have a meeting
I do not think I can find the dharma.

598
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:26,760
Well, you .. Your dharma is not something you ever find
Your Dharma is something that you are always connected, is ..

599
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:28,699
It is your divine purpose, is something that ..

600
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,047
-Hey! -

601
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,000
you line up along your whole life. Hello! -

602
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,399
Ego kept us away from this ..

603
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,714
-Sorry, you must respond.
That's what talking-

604
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,768
Sorry to interrupt you, how can it to me
help to find a partner?

605
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:43,300
You do not need to find a partner. If you live what they say,

606
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:48,862
you understand that everything will be perfect and that everyone will come into your life will come at the right time perfectly.

607
00:33:49,603 --> 00:33:54,965
You are a divine creation of God, you are a spiritual being,
you do not need anyone else to confirm it to you.

608
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:57,034
I loved it.

609
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,705
True, Dr. Dyer said so!

610
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,606
That's the case.

611
00:34:29,007 --> 00:34:32,910
You know? I do not want to believe that
not appreciate what you say, because I appreciate ..

612
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:37,450
It's not necessarily interest you
As I say,

613
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:40,000
because it is ego who tells you what to think, right?

614
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,500
So
you heard!

615
00:34:41,551 --> 00:34:43,835
Yes, we listened! Just because I think it's good to have a plan.

616
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:45,625
Well, what's your plan?

617
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,500
To be a successful filmmaker, to win me a name, to make money
.. To have a good relationship.

618
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,700
So I speak here of prosperity, talk
about abundance, talk about happiness ..

619
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:58,000
 I have a problem with that!

620
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:02,100
I drew the abundance and
prosperity in my life forever, I think

621
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,950
.. Something really simple to do;
really believe that!

622
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:05,731
For you!

623
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Well you know? Problem reporting is your ego,
Ego and .. and .. your attachments. You know?

624
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:18,237
You attach the .. how much money you earn,
you realize how well the movie ..

625
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,997
Everything is in the form in which ..
He told me I should go?

626
00:35:22,502 --> 00:35:27,326
When you attach to things and they disappear, then ..
lose who you are.

627
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:30,411
I feel .. Pushing so much to survive.

628
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,046
We are not talking here of survival,
talk about a change,

629
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:37,885
a shift away from the morning of your life
they had to do everything ..

630
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:42,493
.. External reasons, and move ..
an elevated place in your life.

631
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,907
Why not start with this tomorrow?

632
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,265
How do I change?

633
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:50,333
It's a good idea. You know, they always say
those in the audience who listens to me,

634
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,522
If this is something new for you, about
you have not heard,

635
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:56,071
perhaps there is a change that is going to you.

636
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,100
That's all I missing

637
00:35:58,113 --> 00:35:59,500
It can happen ..

638
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,500
When great thinkers speak
about union with God,

639
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:41,539
is always the issue:
it is to be in silence.

640
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,873
When everyone is sleeping
and no distractions,

641
00:36:47,217 --> 00:36:54,061
When you feel one with the source ..
This is where you are closest to the source.

642
00:36:54,718 --> 00:36:57,960
Being a single source
not only makes you feel good,

643
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,820
make you aware of your own divinity,

644
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,255
and what is able to do.

645
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,600
It refers to a return to the place where you came.
T.S Elliot has a famous quote:

646
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,985
You should not stop seeking,
and finally all our searches ..

647
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:23,209
.. You have to go back to where we started
and know the place .. for the first time

648
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,234
You have to stop.

649
00:37:25,355 --> 00:37:28,960
Wayne! Stop there a minute.
Wait a second.

650
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,906
What is happening?

651
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,207
It's a bad angle, you must descend a little.

652
00:37:31,258 --> 00:37:31,758
How long?

653
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,359
Five minutes.

654
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,800
Wayne, take your five minutes.
Wait there until the rearrange.

655
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,230
Sure, no problem.

656
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,632
You want some water, Dr. Dyer?

657
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,529
No Thanks! We have an ocean here!

658
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,734
Hey, you called the office of Alex Chase, of the ACM.
Please leave a message for Alex after the tone. Thank you.

659
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,650
Alex, David is. Call me when you hear the message,
are .. I am a little worried.

660
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,660
I think something would have to hear before.
What they said exactly?

661
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:05,416
You know what? And .. and .. why we had no meeting yet?

662
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,900
-See the difference? --Yes-

663
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:08,759
Call me, I would be grateful.

664
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,138
Interviews by Wayne Dyer, the second day.

665
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:17,801
Go!

666
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:21,642
Ok, we start with the transition
from ambition to meaning.

667
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:25,289
Wonderful, is a good idea. I could give you
an example from my life

668
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,815
that might help.
When I started writing,

669
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,845
I was blessed, is considered successful in quotation marks.

670
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:36,433
My motivation, very often was ..
How much money will I do with this book?

671
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:42,807
How to show the next contract? A, ..
How many weeks to appear in the list of best-sellers
of The New York Times?

672
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,920
What took place?
Ä, AA .. will appear on The Tonight Show?

673
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,300
Will appear at the Donahue show?

674
00:38:47,301 --> 00:38:48,261
Wait, are confused.

675
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:49,371
Yes?

676
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:53,871
Yes, if successful,
Who cares what motivate you?

677
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:57,084
Well, I think you start to change the definition

678
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:58,935
about what constitutes success.

679
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:04,581
That is, success can be identified
those terms and there are also other forms of the watch.

680
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:10,000
-There are people who listen to you, that is,
where would you be if not .. you had started? -

681
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:11,450
Ie, who were then, right?

682
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:14,241
Sorry for interrupting, but .. change
one question and answer format?

683
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,715
Only I was just curious. Sorry.

684
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,235
No, it's all right. It is a very normal question.
It is a very common concern that the world has.

685
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:27,000
For me, talking about my writing, David
and yes, it was really successful

686
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:32,290
but .. was a part of me, me, who said ..
that there is something more for me.

687
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:37,752
He writes books about psychology.
Your erroneous zones, how to overcome your own limits,
The sky is the limit ..

688
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:40,850
All went well. All were best-sellers.

689
00:39:40,905 --> 00:39:44,963
But inside me changed me.
It was a call to something else,

690
00:39:44,964 --> 00:39:48,562
and I could see changes can be done in my life.
And the change was ..

691
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:54,150
was more towards spirituality.
It was more towards a more elevated consciousness.

692
00:39:54,151 --> 00:40:02,816
I started to become .. excited and .. passionate
I read in the Krishnamurti or Muktananda.

693
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,300
I remember I went to my agent and I said:

694
00:40:05,301 --> 00:40:08,600
I want to write a book about how to
interpret these great spiritual ideas

695
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:11,765
And I said no no no no no,
Her to write a book about sex!

696
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:15,600
He said that .. it will sell, it's like ..
Dr. Ruth already has one ..

697
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:19,100
but you are much better than Dr. Ruth!
You know .. and then still continue and I said:

698
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:22,440
And then a second book for you.
We will do a deal for a set of two books

699
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:24,500
And you write about how to make money, you know?

700
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:26,343
Wayne Dyer's vision on how to make money!

701
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:31,400
And I said Artie, that's it. I said
I can not do it, you need to write about ..

702
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:36,063
But he said: No, no one will buy it!
That's it. These are stories ..

703
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:39,919
away from us, new-age nonsense. You do not want

704
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,300
And I said: But you have to write it!
That's what I live,

705
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:47,401
That's what I feel is so intense ..
I remember I sent my proposal and said:

706
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:52,111
Very well, I will send my not paid
advances seriously because she did not believe.

707
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:59,547
But I still continued. I was kind of feeling
I had strong internal something more to give.

708
00:40:59,548 --> 00:41:04,500
I had something I had to do that was
beyond to let me go with the flow,

709
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:07,534
to do only what we already learned to do.

710
00:41:09,456 --> 00:41:14,815
I remember when I made changes
Although I was a little afraid, I remember that I was ..

711
00:41:14,816 --> 00:41:22,400
perhaps more freely than ever had been in my life.
I was not motivated by .. If people will buy it,

712
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:26,483
How much money will I do if I want
put in the list of best-sellers.

713
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,050
Those have become types of external factors
Becoming things that I watched it on me

714
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:36,061
I rather than on them.
Actually, David, what you trying to say is that

715
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,861
reach a point in your life
where you begin to be guided by something that is bigger than you.

716
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,500
Just line up with the thing you're here
and stay in harmony with Spirit

717
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:50,440
God, the source, stand there!

718
00:41:49,904 --> 00:41:55,246
And while you stay there one-way stage of your life
will take over the bar.

719
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,012
And once you get to the afternoon of your life
is impossible to go back.

720
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:08,141
-Wait, wait .. Months? You can not continue to tell me that
will be months!
If passed as you had told me it five months ago.

721
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,518
-We pause for a second-

722
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:13,548
-No! We do not!
Do not tell me that! What do you mean?

723
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,990
I replace?
I do not know what to say?

724
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,128
The film that meant everything to me!
That .. I ..

725
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:34,558
I gave them this movie! It's my movie!
The film that meant everything to me!

726
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,002
Damn!

727
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:40,784
Ok, that would be a good time for a break.

728
00:42:41,204 --> 00:42:42,523
Do you think is better? Or ..?

729
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:45,075
I think it will be better, to call food.

730
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,970
Eat something and then ..

731
00:42:56,457 --> 00:43:01,690
Lunch break lasts an hour and a half. Those who will not
must remain to eat nearby.

732
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,958
Hey, you might like a little golf?

733
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:05,750
Oh, sure!

734
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,604
Ok, you make a reservation.

735
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:08,231
Thank you.

736
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:11,095
You know how this one would last meeting after lunch?

737
00:43:11,096 --> 00:43:14,956
I do not know. I think that keeps some
the most important topics for the final.

738
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,814
What?

739
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:22,298
A million things are a San Francisco project.
Contractor has provided less than worth now .. budget is insufficient

740
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,072
-Oh, you know what? Listen, you put me in touch with
Still later, while playing golf

741
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,400
Do not go back?

742
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:30,902
Yes, I'm back .. a try. Just ..
I have much work to do.

743
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,200
See you later.

744
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:32,940
Ok.

745
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,376
It's a good book?

746
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,432
It's not bad. I am a lecturer as slowly
but have patience with me.

747
00:43:50,603 --> 00:43:52,474
You said you worked for my husband?

748
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,000
A long time ago. I do not think that remembers me.

749
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:56,300
Oh, I think I remember.

750
00:43:57,826 --> 00:43:59,990
Wow .. We were fired on several at a time, because ..

751
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:02,629
you know, need to reduce staff.

752
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,035
I'm sorry for that.

753
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,450
Hey, it's ok. With true. It is one of
the best things that happened to me.

754
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:11,062
I need to try different things,
to follow other paths.

755
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,060
Like your music!

756
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,603
Like my music, yes.

757
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,448
Well, it seems that your story has a happy ending.

758
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:18,410
Not yet, I hope!

759
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,644
Not

760
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:21,543
Do not rush me now!

761
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,041
No, not what I meant,
but as you seem happy.

762
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,040
Well .. Come on, you know what? You and Chad should come
to this party tonight at singing.

763
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,259
Oh .. Thanks, anyway.

764
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,110
Come on! It should be a celebration
continues to love. Not so named it?

765
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:40,000
Yes, I think so.

766
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:42,600
Then you should be and will there
to help us celebrate.

767
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:43,938
Oh, I can not slip at a party.

768
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,064
I just asked.

769
00:44:45,945 --> 00:44:47,547
You can not invite us!

770
00:44:47,606 --> 00:44:50,241
Too late! Already .. has happened.

771
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:54,863
Ee .. not. Thank you, anyway.

772
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:55,959
See you around here.

773
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:57,000
Ok.

774
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,000
To wear something comfortable!

775
00:45:10,901 --> 00:45:13,773
Denise! Denise!

776
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,123
Hey, slow down! Stop it!

777
00:45:18,603 --> 00:45:19,500
Oh, good!

778
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:21,100
Why did not you stop?

779
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:22,226
I have not seen.

780
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,000
Where are you going?

781
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:28,150
I went to town.
I thought you were in meetings all day.

782
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:32,320
I was .. but .. I was bored.

783
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,469
Well, if Hugh Johnson can do it, you can too.

784
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Are not made for non-profit stuff.

785
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:40,300
Oh, Chad, just to pretend.

786
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:41,302
No, come with you.

787
00:45:41,903 --> 00:45:42,223
What?

788
00:45:44,604 --> 00:45:46,175
I said they come to you in the city.

789
00:45:47,605 --> 00:45:50,819
Dear .. I love you
but I like to go shopping with you.

790
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,200
I need some time with me.

791
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:57,450
I thought it was time to spend together. Right?
Look, Denise, no joke,

792
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,550
not yet support a meeting. Go with you!

793
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,560
How do

794
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,967
Hey! Kids! Stop!

795
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,645
Take it from here or you will remain without water guns.

796
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:24,202
Oh, you have watered everywhere!

797
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:29,270
Oh, no big deal. It's just water! The water is soft.
Do not worry, it's great.

798
00:46:29,271 --> 00:46:30,450
I'm so sorry!

799
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:38,524
Do not you seem! I have eight children, have grandchildren,
these things happen, it's chaos at times.
It's fun!

800
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,344
Thank you. That makes me feel a little better.

801
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,919
I always saw it as an opportunity to practice ..
what I call non-interference.

802
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,100
Oh, I wish I could do that.

803
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:50,130
Well, you can! Sure you can!

804
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,761
Really?
That is, are their mother, not a kind of irresponsibility?

805
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:59,750
Do not see it all as an irresponsibility.
I think that being parents is .. do your children
to be prop up in you.

806
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:04,124
It's just to make unnecessary dependence.
They have a compass. Let them follow their own compass!

807
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,300
Hmm .. and what would I do with myself if I interfere?

808
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,308
I do not know. Have you ever thought about music, or art,
or something like that?

809
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:15,752
How did you know? ..

810
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,826
Know what?

811
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:23,165
Nothing.
Thank you. It was .. very very pleasant to talk to you.

812
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,074
And for me. God bless you!
Namaste! (Peace be with you!)

813
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,473
Namaste!

814
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,175
Well, kids. Come on! It's lunchtime!

815
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,440
I do not want to eat!
Me neither!

816
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,911
Just come to eat when you're hungry!

817
00:48:04,022 --> 00:48:07,153
-.. Eleven touch-down sites and interception ..-

818
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,033
Tuesday. Pa.

819
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:47,860
I think I'll return that dress.

820
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,739
The one you just bought?

821
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,627
The red.

822
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:57,872
I waited 45 minutes after you
as to decide if you want to buy.

823
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,300
I do not think that I like.

824
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,953
And then you bought it?

825
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,434
In fact, I already believe.

826
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:10,300
You took an hour to buy a dress that was already!

827
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:13,200
Ä, stand exactly why that should not come
shopping with me.

828
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:15,895
I have an idea ..
Why do not you stop talking to each other at all?

829
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,551
Jesus, Chad.
Really ought to come alone.

830
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:26,306
Was troubling me a lot.

831
00:49:26,307 --> 00:49:27,520
You have several things in mind!

832
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,714
What can you have in mind?

833
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,752
All right.
I did not want to tell you this until tonight, but ..

834
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,070
What?

835
00:49:42,507 --> 00:49:48,100
This weekend is an adventure for you, right?
Since you are in leadership that meeting ..

836
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:48,700
Right.

837
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,800
You are about to have another adventure ..

838
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:53,873
And what does that mean?

839
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,090
Ahh, God, try to express this in a way familiar to you.

840
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,576
Yeah, well .. I did not close well.

841
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,300
I am pregnant.

842
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,387
What!
Are you kidding!?

843
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,900
No, no kidding.

844
00:50:09,901 --> 00:50:10,750
I do not want children.

845
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:14,505
I know, I do not want. But that just happened
and I thought

846
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,470
Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe should experience
this thing which tells everyone that is so wonderful.

847
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,600
You know, maybe, maybe it's time to stop being so selfish
and begin to think of anyone but ..

848
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,820
I want to be selfish! I like being selfish!

849
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,858
I like our lives. We come and go when we want.
We are happy!

850
00:50:32,156 --> 00:50:34,204
Oh .. You think we're happy, Chad?

851
00:50:35,486 --> 00:50:42,300
I do not know if we are happy. I mean, Lord,
you are always at work and .. and .. we do not see us!

852
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:45,172
I'm always at work because they have
Buy your things that you, Denise!

853
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,605
Cars, clothes, houses, whatever you want.
But still not enough to make you happy!

854
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,860
Please speak slowly!

855
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,700
I want this baby! I think the thing can be
well we can do with our lives.

856
00:50:58,701 --> 00:50:59,989
Come on! I understand what it is.

857
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:05,420
It's about the fact that you feel that you have not done anything in your life, so that you feel that you need a child to be validated.

858
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:06,571
Well, you know what? I do not!

859
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,432
I worked to get out of anything and I will not sacrifice
our lifestyle so that you

860
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:13,809
to treat yourself and have a different concern.

861
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,780
Wow!

862
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,150
A child is a pair of shoes, Denise.

863
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:20,769
I know it, Chad!

864
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:30,600
You're so cruel and so evil.
God, once you were funny. What happened?

865
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:31,636
You planned this, right?

866
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:32,803
It was an accident!

867
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:34,100
Sir, you have to ask you to leave ..

868
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:34,650
Please!

869
00:51:34,651 --> 00:51:35,325
It can happen!

870
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,760
How could you do that? How could you do that?

871
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,875
Thank you so much!

872
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:43,150
Thank you for this tender and precious moment made that all women dream ..

873
00:51:43,151 --> 00:51:45,180
Tender and precious time? Well we do not tender and precious moments.

874
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:45,750
No, we do not.

875
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:48,939
You know what we? We have a prenuptial agreement, an agreement.
You've signed, no children!

876
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,618
I know I changed my mind, ok?
People can change, Chad.

877
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:53,980
You know what? I changed my mind I do not!

878
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:56,154
Oh, and what to do for that?
To divorce because I am pregnant?

879
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,200
I could do. In fact, you certainly divorce!

880
00:51:58,201 --> 00:51:59,270
Can you please shut up?

881
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,626
Ok, fine. I do not care. Do it!
Will be better to raise this child without you.

882
00:52:03,627 --> 00:52:07,040
Good luck! You signed that contract.
I'll get more, you make sure ..

883
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,334
I hate you!

884
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,050
Mr. .. I'm fine! -

885
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,668
Will still be .. I'm fine! -

886
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,760
Sir, you'll have to ask you to leave.

887
00:52:20,761 --> 00:52:21,455
Oh, go.

888
00:52:21,456 --> 00:52:22,415
Do not worry about payment.

889
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:24,472
I will surely pay the lunch.

890
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,093
Please, do not need.

891
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,404
Oh, she has my wallet!

892
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,731
Hey!
You took the wallet, manic!

893
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,551
Have you left the room, you idiot!

894
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:36,885
Call my lawyer call him right now!

895
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:40,278
Oh, how to do this without your precious phone?

896
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,945
Hey, come back!
Go back!

897
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,286
Say something ..

898
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,920
Sample, the sample .. 1, 2, 3, I hear?

899
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,007
All right.

900
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,420
It's better than to sit in the cold, is not it?

901
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:20,856
That's

902
00:53:20,857 --> 00:53:22,932
Hey, want to keep the same size frame, right?

903
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,988
Yes, sure.

904
00:53:26,462 --> 00:53:27,910
Very well. We are ready!

905
00:53:27,911 --> 00:53:29,990
Ok, go ..

906
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,450
Wayne, you could just ..
to move your chair a little ..?

907
00:53:35,451 --> 00:53:36,600
Sure. How is it?

908
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:37,930
Ok, perfect. Perfect, brilliant.

909
00:53:38,457 --> 00:53:39,475
Ok, so that .. are you?

910
00:53:39,476 --> 00:53:40,635
We are well.

911
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:42,548
In regulãDavid

912
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,730
Film ...

913
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,020
David?

914
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,215
David, let's start from where
Wayne talked about change!?

915
00:53:53,403 --> 00:53:55,300
I could only Contiu there ..

916
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,698
For me it's good.

917
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,287
Ok, this .. change, this movement from
ambition to meaning,

918
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:06,436
from morning to afternoon of your life
generally preceded by

919
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,583
what is called a time quantum.

920
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,550
May sound strange for you to use a term like this,
but in reality time quantum refers to ..

921
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,870
featured as when you ..
what Maslow called a peak experience.

922
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,677
The first of these qualities .. are four in total,
The first is that .. is very intense.

923
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,877
The second quality, a characteristic of this
quantum moments, is that it is a surprise.

924
00:54:31,452 --> 00:54:36,870
The third characteristic of these moments of quantum
is that they are favorable, always give a good feeling.

925
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,380
The fourth and last quality is that endure.
That wants to say that there is

926
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:47,656
something that simply comes and go and is outside you.
Stay with you forever.

927
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,741
For example, I recently stopped drinking, 21 years ago.

928
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,220
Nor could I imagine that I could let myself
because he always drank two or three beers a day

929
00:54:58,221 --> 00:55:02,700
along the 10, 15 or 20 years before.
I could not even remember a day not to drink.

930
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:13,000
And I knew I had to make that change, and ..
was 4:05 am in the morning, I remember when ticking clock.

931
00:55:13,459 --> 00:55:15,635
I woke up and was like ..

932
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:20,065
was like a breeze in the room,
something that never experienced before.

933
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:26,611
Aroma of roses that was 21 years ago
and I can tell you that hanging from the closet

934
00:55:26,612 --> 00:55:31,285
of the tab that was there on a mirror
I had a little cartoon, I can see

935
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:35,029
thing as if
as if it happened this morning.

936
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,839
The intensity of this experience is something I could never forget.

937
00:55:39,288 --> 00:55:43,295
I remember how surprised I was
what happens then.

938
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:50,603
It was almost like .. kind of force
took control and I was simply amazed by this.

939
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,855
So if you are lucky that you are reachable happen?

940
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:58,827
No, David, has nothing to do with luck. It's like ..
when the time is right, you're in a different state,

941
00:55:58,828 --> 00:56:03,269
in a different place in your life, what
you should happen, will happen for you.

942
00:56:03,503 --> 00:56:09,037
Points down in your own life, these moments
when you think nothing can go wrong ..

943
00:56:09,504 --> 00:56:14,069
Often the things we need to
to propel us to a higher place.

944
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,300
Let me give you an example.

945
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:24,213
Night before this moment and I just described ..
I took all the family, five children and my wife,

946
00:56:24,604 --> 00:56:26,007
and I went together to a restaurant.

947
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:32,511
And as I always do every time you go to a restaurant
not only ordering a beer, but two, and that was ..

948
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,515
if the wait staff will not be there when I ordered
the second beer, you can still have it.

949
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:44,675
And the waiter said: Oh, excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry but .. I can not serve alcohol

950
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,401
And I said why?

951
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:52,793
And he said: Well, last night one of the waiters
served on someone who was a minor and we have suspended the authorization

952
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,938
I said: Let us get out of here!

953
00:56:55,156 --> 00:57:00,595
And I got up on each child,
I went to Massini, I put belts and so on ..

954
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,463
My wife, God knows how many have to do
and it was so difficult for her to leave the house ..

955
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,205
But nothing seemed to matter to me in that moment,
because I wanted to have my beer,

956
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:16,059
and I think more important than all others,
and went and we went to another restaurant.

957
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,895
And I remember thinking that night,
When preparing for bed, but ..

958
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
how ashamed I was. My wife tried to talk
least to me about this, but .. I did not want to hear anything ..
I was right!

959
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:27,905
And that's what makes your ego always
makes you you're right.

960
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,710
And that night ..
that experience I had at 4:05 am the following day

961
00:57:36,404 --> 00:57:39,400
made me not only to give up alcohol, probably saved my life.

962
00:57:39,401 --> 00:57:45,851
He transformed lives in so many different ways, and ..
everything has happened because .. I was open to it.

963
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,500
Do not believe it!

964
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,071
Sounds as if you sit and you wait for
a kind of revelation to come to you.

965
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,015
Hmm ..

966
00:57:57,929 --> 00:58:01,600
It is not waiting,
You know, the Tao, one of the biggest lessons we learned is

967
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:06,145
that teaches us how to be gentle,
how to be flexible,

968
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,495
how to not always hold control.
One of the great teachings of the Tao says:

969
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,200
Let life you lived!

970
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:14,950
But you did not do anything!

971
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:17,990
That's the key. Ä, sit is where you want to go
they simply give permission.

972
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,473
The recovery movement is told:
leaving to come out (giving up) let you enter God

973
00:58:22,756 --> 00:58:27,590
To allow this source, which always runs
by all and each of us

974
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:29,893
to do and to perform magic.

975
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:35,242
And this magic will always work to our benefit most,
only if we surrender in front of her.

976
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,100
If only you could
to stop to interfere with your life,

977
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:44,113
and just to stop for everything to be done.
If you get in this place, nothing will remain undone.

978
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,530
Everything you need will be there for you.

979
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,281
It is mysterious to most of us, because ..
believe that we who must do everything.

980
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,219
Is not it interesting?

981
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:06,757
That you had everything you needed was your first nine months
Why not stay this true for the next 90 years?

982
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,856
For that interfere

983
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,553
When I was 19 I was in the U.S. Navy,
I was a soldier.

984
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:26,706
And I was given the mission to climb
the carrier, the USS Ranger.

985
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:31,637
And .. was located in Yokuska, Japan.

986
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,970
So I've embarked on a refrigerated ship, USS Vega
in Alameda, California.

987
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:44,900
And even when I was about to climb the ship on
a voyage of 29 days that would cross the Pacific Ocean,

988
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:52,668
My uncle Bill, Bill Volig, who was a school teacher
in Hayworth, California, gave me a hand copy of a book.

989
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,651
The book was a collection of short stories
by Leo Tolstoy.

990
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,249
He wrote novels and short stories not only great, but
and valuable spiritual literature as well.

991
01:00:02,624 --> 01:00:04,798
Was considered to be the soul of Russia.

992
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:09,835
And the first nuvelaã of this collection was called:
Death of Ivan Ilyich.

993
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,402
Ivan Ilyich was a judge who lived in Moscow.

994
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:19,873
One of the most important shaping of this story
is his relationship with his wife.

995
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:26,100
Which, in fact, a hatred for that ..
He despised work. And it felt like she was pressured

996
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:29,525
and pushed him to do so,
because it was a prestigious job.

997
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:36,030
And it was full of rage and anger for internal herself.
Title story already expose to come:

998
01:00:36,031 --> 01:00:38,251
Death of Ivan Illich .. know that he will die.

999
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,280
All right. Ivan Illich was lying on his deathbed,
and his wife were holding his hand. This woman, in fact,

1000
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:49,713
a despised life.
And looks directly into his eyes and his last words are:

1001
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,948
And if all my life
 was a mistake?

1002
01:00:53,855 --> 01:00:54,772
And died.

1003
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:00,343
I was very shaken, I moved a lot,
and I took a NotePad,

1004
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:05,840
and I wrote myself a note. And I said:
Dear Wayne

1005
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,368
not die ..

1006
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,264
with your music still in you!

1007
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,052
And I lived it in my life.

1008
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:21,967
When you die, you return to that source,
and to be in that place of love.

1009
01:01:23,002 --> 01:01:28,505
But Tao says you should not die to get there.
You can die for ego

1010
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,423
and live in perfect love that space while you're here.

1011
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:40,725
This intense, surprising, favorable,
eternal .. features that define

1012
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,482
time quantum, which leads to change
is really an indicator that go back to the Source

1013
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:53,357
that start living the Tao,
reconnect with the intention that field.

1014
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:00,155
In Greek, the word enthusiasm is divided into entheos IASB,
which means: God within.

1015
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:07,473
When you feel passion for something you have inside your enthusiasm,
that God is really speaking to you

1016
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:14,020
and telling you: you can not get at the end of your life
being able to say what Ivan Illich said ..

1017
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:20,447
(And if my life was a mistake?)
I can not think of a greater tragedy than that.

1018
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,532
Hey, Mom!

1019
01:04:07,825 --> 01:04:08,800
What? What?

1020
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:10,404
Earth to Mom, where did you go?

1021
01:04:10,405 --> 01:04:14,382
Sorry, but it
so beautiful!

1022
01:04:15,255 --> 01:04:17,215
I imagined how I paint these trees.

1023
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,879
You can not paint the trees!

1024
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,845
I know honey,
it's like making a painting.

1025
01:04:23,846 --> 01:04:25,595
You know, like when you do a drawing at school?

1026
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,388
Mother, you are not a painter.
I did not paint something never seen.

1027
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,513
Well .. next to the stone out there. Let's go!

1028
01:05:18,861 --> 01:05:19,461
Hey!

1029
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,585
You have some money?

1030
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,917
God bless you!

1031
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:30,987
What?

1032
01:05:32,165 --> 01:05:33,981
I said God bless you!

1033
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:36,793
Why say that? I have not even given any money.

1034
01:05:38,007 --> 01:05:39,273
Have you any money?

1035
01:05:39,768 --> 01:05:41,155
Not right now.

1036
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,801
But you? I need to call a taxi.

1037
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:57,301
Yes. Here we.
That should help you.

1038
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,529
Thank you.

1039
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:05,529
Not happen to have any cell on there, right?

1040
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,424
I do not need.

1041
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,063
Make money with this?

1042
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,262
Make good money!

1043
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:17,859
Where do you live?

1044
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,138
There.

1045
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,029
There.

1046
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,831
But my favorite place there.
Under that tree, it's my favorite.

1047
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,065
I know that tree,
we are friends.

1048
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,788
That's good right?

1049
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:41,636
You know what to do?
Take a few bottles of-this,

1050
01:06:43,002 --> 01:06:48,745
and you can make some money.
There is a device,

1051
01:06:49,203 --> 01:06:52,291
baby bottles inside and
make some money.

1052
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,858
Thank you!

1053
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,170
Maybe I can gather for a cell phone.

1054
01:07:18,086 --> 01:07:18,620
Hey!

1055
01:07:21,857 --> 01:07:23,138
You have some money?

1056
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:33,763
Yes, I have.
We have six pence.

1057
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,671
God bless you!

1058
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,370
Synchronicities
It's a collaboration with destiny

1059
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,640
it becomes the norm
and the ego is no longer the driving force in your life.

1060
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:12,020
You start to recognize that there is intelligence
strong organization that is in all things.

1061
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:17,645
And working with you and for you.
Almost as if you do those things to happen

1062
01:08:17,646 --> 01:08:19,882
only being connected with your Source.

1063
01:08:24,095 --> 01:08:27,945
Destiny, which seemed something imposed on you
of something outside your

1064
01:08:27,946 --> 01:08:30,587
no longer relevant driving force in your life.

1065
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:38,390
You are connected to Source. And it's like this
divine intelligence and organizing, God, Tao,

1066
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:45,655
how you want to call it as you would say:
Music you can not you come here and I will be there

1067
01:08:45,656 --> 01:08:49,435
to help to overcome any conflict or obstacle that appears.

1068
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:53,050
But there is a conflict as a source for your support.

1069
01:08:54,101 --> 01:08:59,091
Yes, good.
Could you send me a cab, please, at Monterey Motors?

1070
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,837
Yes.
Thank you, thank you very much. Goodbye.

1071
01:09:15,453 --> 01:09:20,343
I keep thinking about what you said about
destiny that we required.

1072
01:09:21,204 --> 01:09:25,365
Well, you know? I think all and
Each of us has inside knowledge,

1073
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:30,809
so they say that when you trust in yourself,
just trust in the intelligence that created you.

1074
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,257
It's there to tell us who we are and who we are meant.

1075
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:35,450
I know, but it's like ..

1076
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:35,884
-Hey! -

1077
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,159
Want to drink?

1078
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,643
No, I'm fine.
Dr. Dyer, I can ask a question?

1079
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:41,647
Sure!

1080
01:09:41,812 --> 01:09:45,100
Men and women are different? When it comes to
this change is different?

1081
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:49,021
It is very different indeed. There are some recent studies
I just published about it.

1082
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:50,608
I would like to share with you, if you will.

1083
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:51,515
That would be great.

1084
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:52,562
Okay, great!

1085
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:55,867
Well, go too.

1086
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,265
Ok, I'll be after you.

1087
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,826
So that .. This study was done incredible
I have right here. It's called:

1088
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:10,800
Moments that you turn upside down values.
And has four components:

1089
01:10:10,801 --> 01:10:13,650
Men and women before and after.

1090
01:10:13,902 --> 01:10:18,011
Now, before a time quantum
they were asked to list

1091
01:10:18,012 --> 01:10:22,329
most important priorities in their lives,
the most important up to the least important.

1092
01:10:22,624 --> 01:10:28,546
Now, for men, the first and most important value
they had learned was being,

1093
01:10:28,547 --> 01:10:31,807
accumulation of money.
It's not a huge surprise,

1094
01:10:32,126 --> 01:10:38,219
because we are taught, as men, they grow,
that your job is your family argue that we must stand out.

1095
01:10:38,527 --> 01:10:42,769
The second most important value for all these men was
a sense of adventure.

1096
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,497
To come out .. and want to conquer the world

1097
01:10:45,498 --> 01:10:46,409
Yes, to be slick-

1098
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,657
Yes, sure. To be

1099
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:49,350
Being a macho man.

1100
01:10:49,351 --> 01:10:54,878
The third was what you do.
You know, that men are raised to think that you

1101
01:10:55,303 --> 01:10:58,481
What you realize what you are doing, what you are able to create.

1102
01:10:58,904 --> 01:11:04,315
The fourth is the idea of ??pleasure.
You know, to go out with friends, to have as many meetings,

1103
01:11:04,316 --> 01:11:06,083
how to have some more fun.

1104
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:12,738
The fifth one is to be respected.
And we all know, as men, what this means, right?

1105
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,874
"Do not treat me with respect, man .."

1106
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:19,111
And out in the world, you're an adult or you're a kid,
and if you are not respected .. of party strife.

1107
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,537
Here are the most important priorities in our lives.
You can make money, have a sense of adventure,

1108
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:31,441
to accomplish things, to feel pleasure,
to be respected, this is actually the morning of our lives.

1109
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,387
That sounds like my list.

1110
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,193
What you talking about? When was the last time you had fun?

1111
01:11:36,194 --> 01:11:39,420
Oh .. not listened to it, I know how to have fun.

1112
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:42,484
Excuse me, I try to listen to Wayne.
Continue!

1113
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,330
Thanks, I appreciate it.

1114
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:48,141
Very good, now the second part of the study,
which is the stage after.

1115
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:52,579
A quantum change occurred.
Are the same questions, only many years later,

1116
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:58,413
and followed them throughout life.
And number one is spiritual value.

1117
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,200
Spirituality, the number one changed
from making money to spirituality, not even

1118
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:09,745
Lisa was not before, not even you can not find it,
I list here the top 15 of and does not even appear.

1119
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,722
The second is personal peace.
Less anxiety, less stress, if you want.

1120
01:12:15,052 --> 01:12:20,400
The third is the family. Now, the family was on
other list, but was much lower before.

1121
01:12:20,653 --> 01:12:23,970
Now, what happens after one of these moments,
You start to look around and say:

1122
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,963
Why is it important for me in my life?

1123
01:12:28,273 --> 01:12:34,175
And then the next is the will of God,
this is the one that says: I felt purpose.

1124
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,269
And then honesty is the fifth quality.
Not just because he honestly does not steal, but ..

1125
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,350
how honest are, as a man, you know?
With my feelings with ..

1126
01:12:45,351 --> 01:12:45,998
-Inside-

1127
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,664
Yes, exactly!
Those were the main qualities of men.

1128
01:12:50,665 --> 01:12:55,400
So we have a before and after,
You can see the significant change took place,

1129
01:12:55,401 --> 01:12:57,675
What change has occurred.

1130
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,539
Good evening all!

1131
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,901
Hello!

1132
01:13:09,154 --> 01:13:13,775
Thank you. We are very happy to be here tonight,
Steve and Lisa are some dear old friends of mine.

1133
01:13:14,565 --> 01:13:17,865
So when I asked about the possibility that
Our wedding band to play their

1134
01:13:17,866 --> 01:13:19,926
I felt that I had no option other than to say ..

1135
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,687
Are you sure?

1136
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:29,155
You are convinced that this is what you want to divert the
your friends and family in celebration of your wedding day?

1137
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:34,945
And Steve and Lisa assured me that
This was exactly what he wanted to depart on

1138
01:13:34,946 --> 01:13:40,243
friends and family in celebration of their wedding day.
So that .. here we are.

1139
01:13:41,771 --> 01:13:43,899
-You need a boss that loves you-

1140
01:13:45,452 --> 01:13:47,957
A boss who to hug-

1141
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,217
A boss who to dress up and to take care of yourself-

1142
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,854
A boss to own control-

1143
01:13:55,675 --> 01:13:58,086
You need a man with all the answers-

1144
01:13:59,121 --> 01:14:01,224
A boss to make the show

1145
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,591
A boss to pay the all-

1146
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:08,930
-Never say I do not know-

1147
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,428
Ok ..
-I know that is to ask!

1148
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,841
I can already tell you. -Yes-.

1149
01:14:49,237 --> 01:14:51,130
How it works with women?

1150
01:14:52,783 --> 01:14:56,831
For women it is even more surprising.
Before one of these moments of quantum

1151
01:14:57,350 --> 01:15:02,745
value is the number one family.
And it is not surprising that women

1152
01:15:02,746 --> 01:15:07,715
are, somehow, raised in our society, our culture,
to be a good mother to be a good daughter

1153
01:15:07,786 --> 01:15:10,751
take care of your family, your children and so on.

1154
01:15:11,187 --> 01:15:17,773
The second, which might surprise you, was a feeling ..
independence, to feel like ..

1155
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,831
I would like to feel independent

1156
01:15:20,832 --> 01:15:22,110
Women are paradoxical.

1157
01:15:22,111 --> 01:15:23,244
Yes, binds.

1158
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,700
The third was his career.
Very often, women are not even felt

1159
01:15:28,701 --> 01:15:33,721
that had the right to try to have a career,
because they were obliged to take care of their family,

1160
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:38,677
And it's not that minimize this, but what
what we say here is just something more.

1161
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:43,645
The fourth quality for women was
employment (the template).

1162
01:15:44,495 --> 01:15:46,623
Need to be like others and so on.

1163
01:15:47,235 --> 01:15:53,063
Yes, and then, finally, to be attractive. And this has become ..
not only good to look good, but:

1164
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:57,340
all my values ??depend on the look
Where is that?

1165
01:15:57,341 --> 01:16:02,239
You know what? This is so scary when you analyze it,
because of where we learn that women should

1166
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,294
to thank the other all the time?

1167
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,990
Well, go to a newsstand.
All you see are magazines with pictures of

1168
01:16:09,991 --> 01:16:15,446
Here the size of both girls, and ..
implants, more emphasis on makeup

1169
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:19,323
of brands to be,
appropriate bags to wear, and so

1170
01:16:19,853 --> 01:16:24,237
So that became this top quality, or
characteristics, or values, for women,

1171
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:25,922
before one of these changes.

1172
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:28,634
I hope that after the list is better.

1173
01:16:28,406 --> 01:16:30,052
Values ??were changed completely.

1174
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:35,287
Number one value for women after
Why had this experience, says right here, is:

1175
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,088
My own personal development.

1176
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,242
Now remember that before he was to take care of all
others to do the right thing,

1177
01:16:42,243 --> 01:16:46,406
to fit, and now suddenly is
As I develop as human beings?

1178
01:16:46,407 --> 01:16:48,422
What I feel about myself?

1179
01:16:48,552 --> 01:16:55,150
The second is a feeling of self-esteem.
Worth something? How I feel about myself?

1180
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:56,766
I am a human being valuable?

1181
01:16:56,914 --> 01:17:04,266
The third is spirituality.
My sense of my connection with something bigger and more awesome than me.

1182
01:17:04,415 --> 01:17:08,625
And then, happiness.
Again, this was not on the list,

1183
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,368
was near the end of the first list.

1184
01:17:11,369 --> 01:17:17,150
How often were raised to believe women
that their happiness is important?

1185
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:22,526
that do the right thing to do,
instead .. feel:

1186
01:17:22,759 --> 01:17:24,342
I have the right to be happy!

1187
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:29,602
And then a very interesting, called forgiveness.
That became very important in their lives.

1188
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,200
Forgiveness ..

1189
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:35,812
That's good! Because then I can forgive all those who
you were given wrong information about what

1190
01:17:35,813 --> 01:17:36,800
supposed to do.

1191
01:17:36,801 --> 01:17:41,565
Yes, it is a great deal of resentment, which starts to
II comprises people

1192
01:17:41,566 --> 01:17:41,892
is ..

1193
01:17:41,896 --> 01:17:42,723
e..

1194
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,407
is something that many people simply live.

1195
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,266
Oh, Joe! is great-

1196
01:17:47,267 --> 01:17:48,704
You're the best, thanks!

1197
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:51,036
Yes, that's better, that's what you should do-

1198
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,283
Thank you very much.

1199
01:17:54,233 --> 01:17:57,532
Good night, kids.
You had a busy day.

1200
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,354
Can you bring a glass of water?

1201
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,044
Sure!

1202
01:18:16,306 --> 01:18:17,560
Jason, what is this?

1203
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:18,750
Hmm?

1204
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:22,952
Paper and pencils were here before this.

1205
01:18:23,509 --> 01:18:25,744
I do not know. I have no idea.

1206
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,852
Jason?

1207
01:18:42,001 --> 01:18:42,751
Hmm?

1208
01:18:42,902 --> 01:18:44,788
I think I'll take a shower.

1209
01:18:44,943 --> 01:18:45,668
Ok.

1210
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:30,300
Want to hear something?

1211
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:33,639
Perhaps the only miracle that happened in my life.

1212
01:20:33,856 --> 01:20:34,800
A miracle?

1213
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:37,336
Yes, it was a real miracle for me.

1214
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,118
It was a healing that took place
you still can not explain.

1215
01:20:42,052 --> 01:20:48,083
So that .. was in 2000 and went to
a group of 25 people in a spiritual circuit

1216
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:52,902
Assisi. I made several visits there.
In fact, I wrote an entire book,

1217
01:20:53,388 --> 01:20:57,806
There is a spiritual solution called for each problem,
based on the prayer of St. Francis.

1218
01:20:58,102 --> 01:21:04,382
And I lectured a few hours on it
and visited all the places where St. Francis

1219
01:21:04,383 --> 01:21:06,643
lived and made many of his miracles.

1220
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:11,177
The next day we had to do a trip
in a place called San Damiano,

1221
01:21:11,455 --> 01:21:18,917
where Saint Clara, which was the first woman to become
member of the Franciscan order, lived.

1222
01:21:19,156 --> 01:21:24,430
And on the third floor was the bedroom, just as
was in the thirteenth century.

1223
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:28,928
He was a young man on that trip, was 21 years
his name was John and he was from Pennsylvania.

1224
01:21:29,558 --> 01:21:35,324
Suffered from a terrible paralysis
and had two very heavy brackets for each leg.

1225
01:21:36,094 --> 01:21:41,769
I was going to climb on the third floor and spiral staircase was
to reach the third level,

1226
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:46,729
St. Clara's bedroom where he was.
John, to be able to climb stairs,

1227
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,643
had to move his foot to the outside so
you can imagine, and then make up

1228
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:57,043
and brought it down and then make up the next level
and lifted his other leg, his limbs were rigid because.

1229
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:04,893
But when I started to get into the tight a..
ladder could not

1230
01:22:05,114 --> 01:22:10,100
His legs could not climb, he could only raise them both,
so that he could not climb and you can imagine could not descend,

1231
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:12,853
was impossible for him to descend.
So it was stuck there.

1232
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,506
I was in front of
and I stopped and said to me:

1233
01:22:15,507 --> 01:22:20,697
Wayne, I have problems. I can not climb any ladder
because they can not lift my leg. I did not place.

1234
01:22:20,698 --> 01:22:22,447
And I can not get off. What do we do?

1235
01:22:22,986 --> 01:22:28,140
And it was a whole row of people behind, waiting to climb
On this scale very narrow, you can imagine?

1236
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,946
-Elders not whisper-

1237
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,879
I hear that old-for-

1238
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,544
-We just talk more hard-

1239
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,934
, Year after year-

1240
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,885
-Stop looking at me amused-

1241
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:58,024
-Come here-

1242
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,153
-And I will whisper-

1243
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,574
You have some wonderful cheek-

1244
01:23:03,575 --> 01:23:04,800
Want to dance? -Oh no! -.

1245
01:23:05,601 --> 01:23:06,716
Oh, yes!

1246
01:23:06,717 --> 01:23:09,808
-Will grow more and more an old-
Honey, come on! Do not be shy!

1247
01:23:11,174 --> 01:23:13,363
Old-backs become stiff-

1248
01:23:15,322 --> 01:23:18,798
-All the legs are wider and longer-

1249
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,942
Dreamers dream-all-

1250
01:23:25,954 --> 01:23:28,845
-Are carried away by you-

1251
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,283
Denise?

1252
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,253
Denise?

1253
01:24:26,707 --> 01:24:28,831
So I told him that without even thinking about:

1254
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:37,287
John, what I do is just
to catch up over my back and put your arms

1255
01:24:37,409 --> 01:24:42,545
around my neck, and .. just bend
and I will go up on the stairs.

1256
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:47,413
Now, what I said is not that before you go
in this journey, I seriously hurt

1257
01:24:47,414 --> 01:24:53,773
right knee to a point where
I was examined by several orthopedists,

1258
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:01,182
and I was told that soon will come a time when
I had to replace the knee, because it is rubbing bone on bone.

1259
01:25:01,183 --> 01:25:07,272
So, while up behind me, talking about
about 110 pounds, he came ..

1260
01:25:08,691 --> 01:25:13,546
I got about three steps and I realized that my knee
ago to give and would fall.

1261
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:19,126
And I had a glimpse of what the newspaper, news of Assisi
will report the next morning:

1262
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:23,806
Spiritual director falls on stairs.
40 people dead.

1263
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:30,801
So while my knee began to give way,
At that time, I had a vision of St. Francis.

1264
01:25:31,837 --> 01:25:36,400
I had a vision of how it looks.
And no word said, was very very quickly.

1265
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:40,869
He was just so, with his hands,
In other words, get up!

1266
01:25:41,574 --> 01:25:46,427
And suddenly I felt the fragrance of roses that was in the air,
same flavor that ..

1267
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,760
Remember that story I said it? -The quantum of time! -

1268
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:52,928
The quantum of time, when I went ..
through something similar. And

1269
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:57,820
I got up and started to climb stairs with him
and my knee suddenly recovered,

1270
01:25:57,821 --> 01:25:58,696
was good.

1271
01:25:58,806 --> 01:26:04,342
Not only recovered, but suddenly I had something like ..
a burst of energy, as we never had before

1272
01:26:04,907 --> 01:26:12,607
and started to go faster, with him in the back.
Then I started to run. And I ran the whole scale.

1273
01:26:12,608 --> 01:26:17,021
My wife and I expect the above said
What happened was you? What are you doing? Everyone pulls

1274
01:26:17,022 --> 01:26:18,757
breath, and you ..
And I said:

1275
01:26:20,019 --> 01:26:23,022
I just experienced a miracle. I do not know what happened

1276
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:28,725
And I realized that my knee hurt me not at all
and not limp and not feel any pain.

1277
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:35,810
By the way, I never do any surgery on this knee.
It was .. healing was held at that time.

1278
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,654
Hey!
Living in bed?

1279
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,237
Yes, come in a minute.

1280
01:27:46,424 --> 01:27:47,369
What did you do?

1281
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,200
Nothing.

1282
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,707
I thought he was going to make your shower.

1283
01:27:53,718 --> 01:27:54,581
I did.

1284
01:27:54,998 --> 01:27:56,264
And your clothes?

1285
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:01,240
Aaa .. I wanted to do, but then .. I took nothing.

1286
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:04,298
What are you doing?

1287
01:28:05,552 --> 01:28:06,504
Nothing.

1288
01:28:08,323 --> 01:28:09,758
Are you okay?

1289
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,176
What do you mean?

1290
01:28:12,686 --> 01:28:18,284
Well, you seemed a little stranger today
just wondering if something was wrong.

1291
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,026
No, I'm fine. Do not worry!

1292
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:23,059
I am a little worried.

1293
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,512
No!

1294
01:28:29,629 --> 01:28:30,697
Can I look?

1295
01:28:30,698 --> 01:28:31,842
Jason, no!

1296
01:28:31,843 --> 01:28:33,090
Come on, I just have a look ..

1297
01:28:33,091 --> 01:28:34,106
-Jason .. not! -

1298
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,777
I love what you do, I just want to watch ..

1299
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,610
Can you please leave?

1300
01:28:42,611 --> 01:28:43,600
Come on, I just want to ..

1301
01:28:43,601 --> 01:28:44,426
Just get out!

1302
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,257
Please?

1303
01:28:46,258 --> 01:28:49,392
No!
You know?

1304
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:53,135
However not too good
Do not trouble

1305
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,166
Later I began to vorbec about this miracle, but
what I did was

1306
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,546
when people asked me why do you think happened to you?

1307
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,772
Always say, well
why not? Ie they are ..

1308
01:29:23,773 --> 01:29:24,758
Wayne Dyer, in the end!

1309
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:28,222
And I wrote a whole book about it and e..

1310
01:29:28,223 --> 01:29:29,410
And I deserved a miracle -

1311
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:34,630
Yes! It was like .. I thought that was really
special kind of thing came to me.

1312
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:40,850
This was, you know, when you let your ego get involved.
And what happened then is that I ..

1313
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:43,209
I completely forgot my ego.

1314
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:51,240
It was not because they are so high and spiritual, or that are so special, I instant reaction to what John needed

1315
01:29:51,241 --> 01:30:00,104
was just out to meet them .. and then the miracle happened.
In a moment, without thinking, I went to meet a

1316
01:30:00,105 --> 01:30:08,178
signs, if necessary, and .. I forgot myself,
and was almost as if .. door was opened,

1317
01:30:08,179 --> 01:30:13,930
Masters found me and told me: Here it is!
The best way to open those doors is

1318
01:30:13,931 --> 01:30:18,083
you forget yourself and go out to meet and serve.
Always serve it.

1319
01:30:18,589 --> 01:30:23,885
You know, one of the mistakes that so many people make is that I say:
Well, I'll draw what I want in my life

1320
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:28,694
And one of the things that deeply believe in is that
not attract what you want,

1321
01:30:29,516 --> 01:30:31,496
attract what you are.

1322
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,409
WHAT YOU

1323
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:13,529
Hey, hey!

1324
01:31:14,859 --> 01:31:15,389
Denise!

1325
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,620
Denise, come here!

1326
01:31:18,621 --> 01:31:19,483
Sorry! I'm sorry! -No! -

1327
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,596
I'm so sorry! Should not have to ..

1328
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:21,891
Hey, hey!

1329
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:22,693
Look at me!

1330
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:23,231
Look at me!

1331
01:31:24,871 --> 01:31:25,814
It's all right.

1332
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,109
No, not good.
It is not good!

1333
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:29,585
Everything will be fine.

1334
01:31:29,586 --> 01:31:30,157
No, I did this

1335
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:32,123
Everything will be fine. No, you did nothing.

1336
01:31:32,673 --> 01:31:35,230
I felt I really ..

1337
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,414
I did that.
I made it more like you.

1338
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,107
Listen to me .. I'm sorry!

1339
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:45,285
I love you.

1340
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,646
I love you so much!

1341
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,809
You'll be fine.

1342
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,669
Do not stop! It was great!

1343
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:14,013
Thank you.

1344
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:18,015
What keeps you awake so late?
Or would have had to say so earlier?

1345
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,039
I could not sleep.

1346
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:21,617
Problems with the filming?

1347
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:24,593
No, that's good.
The film is easy.

1348
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,694
My business is one that can not handle.

1349
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:30,834
Hey, have you heard of chopsticks?

1350
01:34:31,407 --> 01:34:32,231
The past.

1351
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,462
It reminds me of when I was a kid.

1352
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:44,175
When I was idealistic when I thought I'll make a name.

1353
01:34:44,176 --> 01:34:45,820
Oh, hey, do not say that!

1354
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:46,980
You have a name.

1355
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:50,691
Yes, but something like Hanson, Scorsese or Tarantino

1356
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:53,566
Hang in there, anything can happen ..

1357
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:59,034
Why be so hard?
Today we have the funds to make my movie

1358
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:02,570
and tomorrow ..
I can not get the money to do without a name ..

1359
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:07,034
.. And I do not get a name out of money.
And then I simply take the project.

1360
01:35:07,495 --> 01:35:11,027
Not even belong to me.
I am thinking seriously ..

1361
01:35:11,548 --> 01:35:12,658
job change.

1362
01:35:13,809 --> 01:35:14,732
Ä, be it a good sign.

1363
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:17,120
What?

1364
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:18,162
Give up.

1365
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:20,013
That's good.

1366
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,526
How do you know?

1367
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:23,206
You can not push things.

1368
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:26,206
Well ..
The magic thing again

1369
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,288
What magic thing?

1370
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,801
I do not know why I say this ..
seviciu man .. or what have you sheep ..

1371
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,420
They do many things here.
Believe me!

1372
01:35:40,421 --> 01:35:44,099
You play the piano very well, though.
You should think to do this as a job.

1373
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,500
Well .. for a while I thought that I will.

1374
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:48,037
And? What happened?

1375
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:53,957
I started singing when I was very young.
I was a talent.

1376
01:35:55,413 --> 01:35:59,637
And then I grew and I became more aware
the people watching me sing.

1377
01:36:00,358 --> 01:36:01,305
And then ..

1378
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,496
I started playing more for themselves
than for me.

1379
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:10,739
And then I became very scared
because I would be disappointed.

1380
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,225
And so I did.

1381
01:36:15,418 --> 01:36:16,329
What did you do?

1382
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:17,773
I have disappointed everyone.

1383
01:36:18,157 --> 01:36:24,066
I was very smart, I went to a concert ..
and I played a few ..

1384
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:28,108
intentionally wrong notes ..
As evidence

1385
01:36:29,422 --> 01:36:33,205
to see if I would just love
and

1386
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,728
in fact they did not.

1387
01:36:37,879 --> 01:36:40,890
It's been a long time and then up again to reach the piano.

1388
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:47,086
It's just .. crazy,
when I think how much I like to sing.

1389
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,451
Yes, I just thought about it.

1390
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,617
Ä, is sitting here for years
but I grabbed him

1391
01:36:52,628 --> 01:36:54,025
I have not even noticed.

1392
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,068
You pianist? I do not understand.

1393
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:58,900
Do not you understand?

1394
01:36:58,901 --> 01:37:00,705
How could you ignore what was right in front of you?

1395
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,461
For that you get with other things.
You should understand that.

1396
01:37:07,653 --> 01:37:08,200
What?

1397
01:37:08,201 --> 01:37:11,877
Wait. Keep your idea.
Hear that?

1398
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,471
I can not hear anything ..

1399
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,351
Listen

1400
01:37:21,258 --> 01:37:22,043
Listen

1401
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,773
This is beautiful. I love it.

1402
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:35,195
That I liked.

1403
01:37:38,841 --> 01:37:39,961
Improvise?

1404
01:37:40,456 --> 01:37:43,203
Yes well, no ..
In a way ..

1405
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,090
In a way, yes, but generally do not ..

1406
01:37:45,644 --> 01:37:46,401
What?

1407
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:49,222
It's just something you can do.

1408
01:37:49,846 --> 01:37:50,956
That is to write?

1409
01:37:50,957 --> 01:37:52,604
No! I can not ..

1410
01:37:54,109 --> 01:37:55,512
Then pretend well.

1411
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,843
I just .. I listen.

1412
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:00,300
Are you listening?

1413
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:05,480
I listen to ..
And then just sing what I hear.

1414
01:38:07,752 --> 01:38:12,081
I do not invent at all.
It invents single

1415
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,033
Only?

1416
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,429
Exactly.
I just sing.

1417
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:29,462
Sometimes all you need to do ..
is to show and be careful ..

1418
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:37,314
and music is.
Your music is.

1419
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,629
Whatever you're looking for in your life
is there for you.

1420
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,821
He will make an appearance where and when needed.
It is always in your mind.

1421
01:39:13,297 --> 01:39:17,170
Whatever you need to complete this project,
or whatever you need to create,

1422
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:21,538
everything is there.
Can you prepare and then to stop.

1423
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:25,231
It is a basic trust that everything
will happen perfectly.

1424
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,879
Lean forward, then towards the bottom of the column-

1425
01:39:35,941 --> 01:39:39,940
Bend knees, place hands on floor,
move your hips up and down,

1426
01:39:39,941 --> 01:39:41,743
Left, Right, Left, Right ..

1427
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:44,333
-You know what? -
I can not shoot here.

1428
01:39:45,064 --> 01:39:45,600
No?

1429
01:39:45,601 --> 01:39:47,019
No, it's too much reflex.

1430
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:49,802
Well, we really need something for the second.
We have nothing.

1431
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:52,538
Let not
No director! I do not know what does David!

1432
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:53,937
Why not here, anyway?

1433
01:39:53,938 --> 01:39:55,666
Probably sleeping a hangover be.

1434
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:59,042
Well, you must go, I can not shoot from here, out.

1435
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,716
Oh, well. Brilliant. Enter and filming.

1436
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:03,395
Not living with me

1437
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,539
I? Do not go.
Must be 200 degrees there!

1438
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:07,976
Ok.

1439
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:08,879
But you?

1440
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,610
The wind is like it here ..

1441
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,815
You should receive a bonus for that.

1442
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:16,337
You are my hero!

1443
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,108
You are nasal.

1444
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:27,167
Hey, good morning!

1445
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:30,130
Good .. morning?

1446
01:40:30,131 --> 01:40:31,885
I woke up early. We search for locations.

1447
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:32,499
What?

1448
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,596
We found the greatest place
overlooking the ocean.

1449
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,640
Why? For that?

1450
01:40:36,641 --> 01:40:37,435
Yes, yes, that!

1451
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:38,386
Seriously?

1452
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,663
It's a bit far.

1453
01:40:41,913 --> 01:40:44,903
This is good
You'll benefit from your creativity ..

1454
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:46,460
You seem inspired, David!

1455
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,257
I'm inspired!
Make music, do you have ..

1456
01:40:49,504 --> 01:40:50,917
What are you talking about?

1457
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:52,611
What is Rob there one?

1458
01:40:53,411 --> 01:40:55,137
That's a little crazy torture with hot yoga.

1459
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:55,944
Yes ..

1460
01:40:56,229 --> 01:41:01,201
I can not leave him there alone.
Cover me, I'll go.

1461
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:02,427
You'll get?

1462
01:41:04,417 --> 01:41:06,263
Come in, I can not believe it!

1463
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:14,626
We live in a world where all things are possible.
There are no accidents.

1464
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,696
It is this divine intelligence, organizing
supporting it.

1465
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:41,816
I think we should get to
Stop focusing only on you.

1466
01:41:42,134 --> 01:41:45,612
And about the things you really want for you ..
to begin to say:

1467
01:41:46,336 --> 01:41:49,627
as I might want more for others,
than they want for me?

1468
01:41:52,954 --> 01:41:54,924
And this is the work of God.

1469
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:05,512
One of the things that happen when you
remove the ego is that you change the

1470
01:42:05,513 --> 01:42:12,430
to feel that everything you ought to feel the humble.
Do you realize that you ought not nothing,

1471
01:42:12,431 --> 01:42:13,578
only ego that thinks.

1472
01:42:15,890 --> 01:42:18,710
So the fundamental truth is
you have to be that what you created.

1473
01:42:18,711 --> 01:42:23,206
If you created divinity, must be divine.
If you raise your hands and say:

1474
01:42:23,463 --> 01:42:27,141
These are God's hands ..
So what does God's hands?

1475
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,389
God only gives, that is what God knows to do.

1476
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,671
Good!

1477
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:37,811
How are you this morning?

1478
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,867
Better than yesterday.

1479
01:42:40,872 --> 01:42:41,993
This is a good shape to be!

1480
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:47,090
Not better than anyone else, only
better than you were.

1481
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,140
Hey ..
I was wondering ..

1482
01:42:52,141 --> 01:42:57,279
Is there a place here where I could buy some flowers?
I would like to take some of my wife.

1483
01:42:58,648 --> 01:43:00,137
Can I let you get some of this, if you want.

1484
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:00,989
Seriously?

1485
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:02,980
Yes.
That is, not luxury flowers, such as

1486
01:43:02,981 --> 01:43:07,049
those that take the flower, wild roses are just ..
more rustic.

1487
01:43:07,877 --> 01:43:09,592
I think my wife would be able to even likes it.

1488
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:15,790
Hey, wait, let me help you!
Cut .. just cut the leaves that ..

1489
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,362
leaves over there ..
and tries to do a little oblique.

1490
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:23,164
That's it!
Welcome!

1491
01:43:23,735 --> 01:43:25,330
You know that I never done this?

1492
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:26,775
Do not get too good at gardening?

1493
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,840
No, usually they pay others to
take care of my garden.

1494
01:43:29,841 --> 01:43:31,985
People who know what they do, like you.

1495
01:43:32,407 --> 01:43:35,626
Yes, well, I like a lot to do this.

1496
01:43:36,298 --> 01:43:38,909
I never saw the value of flowers, I suppose.

1497
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:41,016
I've never sent flowers to your wife?

1498
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:41,828
No.

1499
01:43:43,023 --> 01:43:44,098
Oh, that sounds bad.

1500
01:43:46,021 --> 01:43:46,965
Well, today is a new day.

1501
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,609
Yes it is!

1502
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:54,671
You know, there are over 200 species of roses.

1503
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:03,510
And there is a database of roses
which has over 6,000 variations of roses.

1504
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:07,795
It seems almost excessive.
You!

1505
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:11,314
Thank you very much. I can give you a tip?

1506
01:44:12,507 --> 01:44:13,392
No, no, thank you.

1507
01:44:13,395 --> 01:44:14,014
Are you sure?

1508
01:44:14,015 --> 01:44:14,545
It's okay.

1509
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:17,624
I will certainly tell the owner of this
place that has good staff.

1510
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:19,414
You just did.

1511
01:44:21,597 --> 01:44:24,064
You?
Are you the owner?

1512
01:44:24,725 --> 01:44:26,111
Well .. Yes, they are.

1513
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:32,273
I apologize, I
I thought you were .. just a gardener.

1514
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,823
This is an easy mistake to make.

1515
01:44:34,166 --> 01:44:35,563
So the wet flowers? ..

1516
01:44:36,717 --> 01:44:37,855
Well

1517
01:44:38,824 --> 01:44:40,435
Plants need to be watered.

1518
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:42,377
Yes, they need.

1519
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:47,000
Thank you once again.

1520
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,456
Can I ask you something?

1521
01:44:51,457 --> 01:44:52,052
Yes, sure.

1522
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:55,526
I'm here for a meeting of a committee.

1523
01:44:55,527 --> 01:44:57,441
Yes, the Promise House, right?

1524
01:44:57,442 --> 01:45:01,240
Yes, we need to give it executive director,
but do not know the camera stands.

1525
01:45:01,241 --> 01:45:02,800
Oh, I can find.

1526
01:45:02,801 --> 01:45:04,478
Well, actually
Could you give it to him for me?

1527
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,543
Yes, sure, it's important?

1528
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:08,902
There are only
Only some papers.

1529
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,360
Ok, fine.

1530
01:45:10,361 --> 01:45:13,927
And if you could give him this afternoon,
After I have left.

1531
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,546
Yes, I could do that.

1532
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:17,075
I am grateful.

1533
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,940
So that you change your thoughts to:
What will I get? to:

1534
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:27,849
What can I offer? How can I help?

1535
01:45:28,343 --> 01:45:32,915
If your attention is outside you and
in connection with giving, the universe will respond

1536
01:45:32,916 --> 01:45:34,157
giving you and you back.

1537
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:39,789
The universe will say, what can I help you?
But you must be as a servant,

1538
01:45:40,201 --> 01:45:44,645
then when the transition is complete.
When you move there, which is without ego.

1539
01:44:56,522 --> 01:45:50,424
Hey, good!

1540
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:51,249
Good!

1541
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:53,319
I missed you yesterday. We had a great game.

1542
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:55,435
Yes, I was stuck in the city.

1543
01:45:55,436 --> 01:45:57,005
Yes, I understand. The problems arise.

1544
01:45:57,215 --> 01:45:58,072
Yeah, that's

1545
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,143
A, as the meeting went?

1546
01:46:00,455 --> 01:46:04,570
Nothing has changed. Still need money.
Once they have money, we'll see who

1547
01:46:04,571 --> 01:46:08,327
will get the contract.
See you in town.

1548
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,000
Well, see you.

1549
01:46:13,182 --> 01:46:17,205
Not so fast!
Do not ring, do not want to destroy the flowers!

1550
01:46:17,437 --> 01:46:22,660
That's very good.
Oh, you say, do not want to know how the flowers have cost this.

1551
01:46:22,661 --> 01:46:27,784
You know, are the same flowers that the mayor uses.
Oh, be careful, please!

1552
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:29,679
Thank you!

1553
01:46:36,005 --> 01:46:38,033
How about if the name Rose will be a girl?

1554
01:46:50,710 --> 01:46:54,627
As we move to phase in the meaning of our lives,
is not as if we have not be ambitious,

1555
01:46:55,064 --> 01:46:59,265
difference is that the way of ambition.
You are ambitious in relation to other things.

1556
01:47:02,425 --> 01:47:07,697
So now your ambition is transformed in order.
And you must learn to become observer

1557
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:13,125
and give a step back.
Start living moment

1558
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:17,681
trusting in where you will take your source.
Results begin to detach.

1559
01:47:18,035 --> 01:47:22,328
And this separation allows you to not fight always
and only allows things to come to you.

1560
01:47:22,825 --> 01:47:27,247
You are not the person who makes things happen,
allow them to appear.

1561
01:47:27,944 --> 01:47:29,394
The fight is gone.

1562
01:47:31,515 --> 01:47:34,766
And I asked again and again:
there is any purpose for ego?

1563
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:42,430
And my reaction to this is simply not worth guarding him.
Ego is the false self.

1564
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:45,060
And when you defend,
defend an illusion.

1565
01:47:45,061 --> 01:47:50,285
Defend something that is not really who you are.
Your authentic self is beyond the ego.

1566
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:56,467
Each of us knows that we came here
with music from singing.

1567
01:47:57,670 --> 01:48:02,575
Yet we tend to think that we enitãti
separate, and .. that we must qualify

1568
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:05,356
and that this is the role of our lives.
And anything that's not true.

1569
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:09,190
Change can take place in many ways.
It may be just a comment

1570
01:48:09,191 --> 01:48:14,023
may be a coincidence occurs,
a particular event that is not expected

1571
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:17,309
can be anything.
But the result is always the same.

1572
01:48:18,190 --> 01:48:22,195
Began to realize that you are not here to
forcing life to make a fight of it always,

1573
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,117
you are here to enjoy and to live in peace.

1574
01:48:25,587 --> 01:48:27,862
This is what happens when you are in the afternoon of your life.

1575
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,423
I think of all the things you need to do
as to pack for departure.

1576
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:36,362
Oh, yeah?

1577
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:39,267
I'm like a list of things to do ambulance.

1578
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:45,107
90% of my days I care for lives
all around and all their problems.

1579
01:48:47,530 --> 01:48:49,805
You are very appreciated!

1580
01:48:51,363 --> 01:48:58,940
That's not what I meant.
I like to take care of you and the boys really.

1581
01:48:58,941 --> 01:49:00,319
I love my family, but

1582
01:49:02,155 --> 01:49:02,675
But?

1583
01:49:06,206 --> 01:49:11,825
the paint
go somewhere else

1584
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:19,065
I feel connected,
I feel blessed.

1585
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:20,325
And you're good at it.

1586
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:25,434
I miss you so much!
When I went yesterday ..

1587
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:30,290
when Jack told me that I do not paint,

1588
01:49:34,032 --> 01:49:36,608
I realized that my own children
have no idea who I am.

1589
01:49:36,609 --> 01:49:38,387
They do not know what I do.

1590
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,046
Then do it!

1591
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:46,782
Seriously?

1592
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,814
Yes, of course!

1593
01:49:49,744 --> 01:49:54,526
Thank you.
I want to stay here.

1594
01:49:55,812 --> 01:49:56,756
What?

1595
01:49:56,758 --> 01:50:00,078
Only for a week.
Right now, only next week.

1596
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:01,724
Do you think I will leave here alone?

1597
01:50:01,725 ??--> 01:50:02,607
Jason!

1598
01:50:03,105 --> 01:50:06,748
Every cell of my body wants
him to stay here just a little more

1599
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:11,405
I hear you, but I
I have no idea what you're saying.

1600
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:15,345
I need to refocus,
I need to find my way back

1601
01:50:15,346 --> 01:50:17,283
solitude and I need to do that.

1602
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,978
But .. you are the mother of two young children,
can not you part of loneliness ..

1603
01:50:20,979 --> 01:50:22,809
Jason! You should know that I love you!

1604
01:50:24,812 --> 01:50:30,693
And I love the children ..
and are still in us, but more than that.

1605
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:42,063
Ok. There is only one problem.
You see, I do not know how to do what you do.

1606
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,789
Oh, I'll handle it.
It's just for a week.

1607
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:47,620
You'll survive!

1608
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:48,674
And then back to normal?

1609
01:50:49,524 --> 01:50:50,625
I do not know what to say ..

1610
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:52,421
O.. a

1611
01:50:52,422 --> 01:50:54,437
You're good at it ..
Oh it's not fair!

1612
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,871
You know what you'll become good?

1613
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:56,972
What?

1614
01:50:57,357 --> 01:51:00,600
Laundry.
I see many clothes in your future.

1615
01:51:01,273 --> 01:51:03,312
That's that's great!
This is great.

1616
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:18,470
If you want to see doors opening into your life
Break away from what your ego says

1617
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:22,444
and allows you to yourself to live in this
divine place called Spirit.

1618
01:51:22,891 --> 01:51:26,294
And what Lao Tzu called virtues,
said that there are four in total:

1619
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,958
The first one is reverence before
life, which refers to respect.

1620
01:51:32,385 --> 01:51:36,598
The second is honesty, what really
there is nothing more than honesty.

1621
01:51:37,327 --> 01:51:42,859
The third is the kindness, which manifests
as goodwill in our lives.

1622
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:49,456
And the fourth is to provide aid, which manifests
as serving to provide services to others.

1623
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:54,870
These were the four virtues.
And Lao Tzu asks us to live according to them.

1624
01:51:56,197 --> 01:52:00,377
It's a great quote the poet Hafiz, he said:

1625
01:52:00,378 --> 01:52:05,389
even after all this time,
The sun never says to the Earth: You owe me.

1626
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:12,753
Just think what it can do a love like this.
Illuminates the whole world.

1627
01:52:46,773 --> 01:52:47,957
-When you come back? -

1628
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:50,643
-In a week ... I will return in a week-

1629
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:52,520
-Pa, kids -

1630
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,922
Oh, David!

1631
01:53:19,923 --> 01:53:20,304
Hey

1632
01:53:20,305 --> 01:53:22,216
Good! What are you doing?

1633
01:53:23,847 --> 01:53:25,041
So that .. You get everything you needed?

1634
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:27,803
I think I got even more than that.

1635
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:28,329
Seriously?

1636
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:31,133
I am very inspired.
I looked at some frames

1637
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:34,511
and I would like to do something with this interview,
something creative.

1638
01:53:34,723 --> 01:53:35,540
What?

1639
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:38,581
Well .. this place!
Something is happening here,

1640
01:53:38,582 --> 01:53:41,000
things about which you speak,
human subjects.

1641
01:53:41,001 --> 01:53:42,490
I think I can do something with it.

1642
01:53:42,491 --> 01:53:46,541
Wait a minute. I thought you were just a technician.
That's not what you said before?

1643
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:51,235
I think not.
I think I'm starting to catch.

1644
01:53:52,127 --> 01:53:54,313
Well, you know, David? The thing is that
we will all catch.

1645
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,300
After all, all one to understand.

1646
01:53:56,301 --> 01:54:00,157
It is a replica of a great chapter of Acts,
where Jesus says:

1647
01:54:00,553 --> 01:54:04,590
If you want to be me, knowing that
You and I are similar, I will help.

1648
01:54:05,317 --> 01:54:10,174
If you want to be different from me, I expect
until you change your mind.

1649
01:54:11,015 --> 01:54:12,805
And you'll change your mind!

1650
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,360
And, really, is not it?
Ultimately,

1651
01:54:15,361 --> 01:54:17,691
Why must we die to understand?

1652
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:19,823
We must be able to understand while we're here.

1653
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:23,210
It was a pleasure.

1654
01:54:23,211 --> 01:54:24,505
Thank you, friend.
God bless you!

1655
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,591
Nobody needs to ask themselves:
What is my purpose?

1656
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:52,430
He can always find help.
If you even for a day

1657
01:54:52,431 --> 01:54:56,133
to be careful to make life better
for someone else, if you can focus

1658
01:54:56,134 --> 01:54:58,720
to think so,
God thinks so.

1659
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:02,931
There is a classical concept, but
is still relevant:

1660
01:55:03,355 --> 01:55:06,421
to touch someone's life is more valorors
than any amount of money.

1661
01:55:07,551 --> 01:55:09,036
My friend, Byron Katie says:

1662
01:55:09,247 --> 01:55:13,622
to believe that you need what you have
is the definition of insanity.

1663
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:17,729
That you can not feel fulfilled until
not get all these things, this is an illusion.

1664
01:55:18,107 --> 01:55:24,610
The really, you do not need anything more.
No matter what you do, you can

1665
01:55:24,611 --> 01:55:27,487
to be a taxi driver, a teacher, a
factory worker, a manager.

1666
01:55:28,197 --> 01:55:31,741
What matters is that you focus your attention on:
How can I serve?

1667
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:35,885
Think of people that go,
anyone would be in your way.

1668
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:40,235
You can run a whole business like that.
Without being attached to the result, but the

1669
01:55:40,236 --> 01:55:45,623
attentive servers.
Your life turns living according to those virtues:

1670
01:55:46,298 --> 01:55:48,389
How can I serve?
How can I be helpful?

1671
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,755
How can you give respect?

1672
01:55:50,049 --> 01:55:52,304
Thinking it means that
live with meaning.

1673
01:55:54,299 --> 01:55:57,495
Morning messages are about what you
and what you can not do.

1674
01:55:58,693 --> 01:56:04,120
About how society defines you.
But the afternoon, after the change, are about

1675
01:56:04,121 --> 01:56:08,434
connection with an energy that charges for everything,
and we're all just made.

1676
01:56:09,468 --> 01:56:12,765
Try to stop breathing,
stop your nails to grow

1677
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:15,769
Virtue is to live everything we need to do.

1678
01:56:17,056 --> 01:56:22,317
The truth is that I feel that all else charges,
so it's really about his surrender.

1679
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:28,155
Do you teach someone who is bigger than you, which
are connected and who has control of everything really.

1680
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:39,652
There is something very deep within us,
who wants to feel fulfilled, who wants to know:

1681
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:41,453
My life made a difference,

1682
01:56:42,306 --> 01:56:47,001
So I left this .. Instead, this planet that
I lived better than when I arrived.

1683
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:53,167
That's life was deeply touched
because of my existence.

1684
01:56:53,668 --> 01:56:58,830
We all want that.
It is not age, or you discover about yourself.

1685
01:56:59,518 --> 01:57:03,790
Wherever you are and of any age,
you just thought distance

1686
01:57:04,877 --> 01:57:06,179
to change your life.
