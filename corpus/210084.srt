1
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:43,570
- Hi, Sister.
- Hi, Billie Jean. How you doing?

2
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,611
It's the late Sister Helen.

3
00:01:57,854 --> 00:02:01,449
I've got a note from my mama, ldella.
Do you need a new notebook?

4
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:03,283
- Thanks.
- How about you, Melvin?

5
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:06,324
The resident council wants us
at their meeting tomorrow.

6
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:09,225
- Can you be there at 7:00?
- Yes.

7
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:12,662
- New poetry books.
- Your poem got all smudged.

8
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:13,834
Smudged?

9
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,800
Sister Helen, I got
another letter from that guy.

10
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,441
- Which guy is that, Luis?
- Angola inmate, death row.

11
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:23,107
- Oh, yeah.
- Could you write to him?

12
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:26,213
Sounds like he could use
some friendly words.

13
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:28,679
- I'll come up after the class.
- Okay.

14
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:31,580
- It got smudged.
- You can still read it.

15
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:40,790
"There's a woman standing there
in the dark.

16
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,430
And she's got big arms to hold you.

17
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,134
But you won't feel
those arms that hug...

18
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,730
... till you can see her face.

19
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:53,602
So you stand there waiting for
the light at the end of the road. "

20
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:56,937
Idella, that is so fine.

21
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,511
Thank you.

22
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:09,114
"My lawyer seems to have disappeared,
so I need help on the legal end.

23
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,726
But if you can't do that,
I'd take a kind word or a visit.

24
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:14,725
Gets real quiet here sometimes. "

25
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:18,456
None of these guys on the row
can afford an attorney for appeals.

26
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:21,795
You can imagine the calls
we get from death row inmates...

27
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:24,905
- ...begging us to find attorneys.
- Who'll work for free.

28
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:27,837
Right. These petitions
take hours to prepare.

29
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:30,910
Attorneys aren't exactly
lining up for the job.

30
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:55,399
"Dear Sister Helen,
thank you for writing to me.

31
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:59,904
I'm writing from my home.:
my 6- by-8-foot cell.

32
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,578
I'm in here 23 hours a day.

33
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,476
We don't work on death row.

34
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:10,310
We're special here. They keep us
away from the general population.

35
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,351
We're the elite because we gonna fry.

36
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,251
It's hard not to get soft here.

37
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,983
I press my footlocker, lift it,
to try to get my muscles in shape.

38
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,829
It's hard not to get fat.

39
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:25,830
Rice, potatoes, pancakes, beans.

40
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,060
Sometimes I feel like
a sow on a farm...

41
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:31,102
... that's being fattened up
for a Christmas slaughter.

42
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:34,543
I dreamt once that I was
about to be fried in the chair...

43
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:37,974
...and then God come into my cell
with a chef's hat on.

44
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:41,615
He rolled me around in bread crumbs,
licking His chops and all.

45
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:45,316
Maybe I'm a weirdo
to have dreams like that...

46
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:48,490
...but your mind does funny things
when you're surrounded...

47
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:50,659
...by people that want to kill you.

48
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:53,462
Anyway, thanks for writing.

49
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:56,028
I don't get many letters
or visitors either.

50
00:04:56,266 --> 00:05:00,327
No one in my family seems able to make
the trip out here. I understand.

51
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:03,628
It's a long drive from Slidell. "

52
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,444
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Father.

53
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,807
- Sister...
- Helen Prejean. Nice to meet you.

54
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,983
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

55
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:28,187
- Have you been in a prison before?
- No, Father.

56
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:32,390
Sister Clement and I sang at the
New Orleans Juvenile Detention Center.

57
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:35,433
We sang "Kumbaya,"
and the boys really liked it.

58
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:38,163
They made up
their own verses, singing:

59
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:41,400
Someone's escaping, my Lord

60
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:44,078
The guards made us sing
a different song.

61
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,173
Where is your habit?

62
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:50,481
Our Sisters haven't worn
the habit for 20 years.

63
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,986
You are aware of the papal request
regarding nuns' garments, aren't you?

64
00:05:56,893 --> 00:06:00,590
I believe the pope said
"distinctive clothing," not habits.

65
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,529
Well, I'm sure you'll interpret it in
your own way. Whatever's convenient.

66
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:08,165
Matthew Poncelet.

67
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:11,168
I remember him from the news.

68
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:12,874
Him and another fella...

69
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:16,710
...shot two children in the back
of the head on Lover's Lane.

70
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:18,470
Raped the girl.

71
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:21,650
Stabbed her several times.

72
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,914
Do you know what you're getting into?

73
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:29,356
So, what is it, Sister?

74
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,184
Morbid fascination?

75
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,259
Bleeding-heart sympathy?

76
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,296
He wrote me and asked me to come.

77
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:40,331
There is no romance here, Sister.

78
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,235
No Jimmy Cagney
"I've been wrongly accused.

79
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:47,910
If I only had someone
who believed in me" nonsense.

80
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,975
They are all con men.

81
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:53,546
And they will take advantage
of you every way they can.

82
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,183
You must be very, very careful.

83
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,115
Do you understand?

84
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:00,578
Yes, Father.

85
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,453
These men don't see many females.

86
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:08,323
For you to wear the habit
might help instill respect.

87
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:13,627
For you to flout authority will only
encourage them to do the same.

88
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,514
Woman on the tier!

89
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:55,376
You can wait there.
We'll bring your man out for you.

90
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:38,413
Well, Matthew, I made it.

91
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:42,885
Thanks for coming, ma'am.

92
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:47,257
Never thought I'd be visiting
with no nun.

93
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,767
So you're a nun.

94
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:58,996
Yep.

95
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:10,018
I'm here to listen. Whatever you
want to talk about is fine.

96
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,817
You're very sincere.

97
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:14,547
What do you mean?

98
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:17,116
You never done this before.

99
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,852
- Never been this close to a murderer?
- Not that I know of.

100
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:23,322
Lots of niggers down where you live.

101
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:26,558
They knock each other off
like beer cans off a fence.

102
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,036
When I got your letter,
I seen Helen on it.

103
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:34,243
I thought it was my ex-old lady.
Almost ripped it up.

104
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:36,945
She turned me in.
She called the cops.

105
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,813
- Orphaned our kid, the stupid bitch.
- You've got a kid?

106
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,984
- Yeah, a con with a kid.
- Girl or boy?

107
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:44,982
- Girl.
- What's her name?

108
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,155
- You ask a lot of questions.
- I don't know you.

109
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:50,086
Yeah, well, never mind.

110
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:57,522
Your letter said
you work with the poor.

111
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:01,566
Your daddy was a lawyer?
You come from money, don't you?

112
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:03,431
Some.

113
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:07,973
And you live in St. Thomas Projects?
I don't know who's crazier, you or me.

114
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:10,679
- I live where I work.
- Yeah, in the slum.

115
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,847
What about you?

116
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,105
I live here.

117
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,408
You were brought up poor?

118
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,879
Ain't nobody with money on death row.

119
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:22,316
You and I have something in common.

120
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:26,157
- What's that?
- We both live with the poor.

121
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:40,803
Ain't you gonna ask me what I done?

122
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:45,379
- The chaplain filled me in.
- Oh, Farley?

123
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:49,179
Yeah, well, he's a very religious man.

124
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,490
I didn't kill nobody.

125
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,619
- Carl went crazy on me.
- Carl?

126
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:05,391
Vitello. He ought to be sitting here.
He went nuts on me.

127
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:10,071
I was scared. Did what he said,
held that boy back. He killed them.

128
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:13,975
You watched him kill these kids?

129
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:16,041
I'll tell you the truth, ma'am.

130
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:20,845
Me and Carl were loaded on downs,
acid, booze when this happened.

131
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,478
I hadn't slept in two nights.
I was out of my head.

132
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:26,944
But I didn't kill them.

133
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:31,324
I didn't kill nobody.
I swear to God I didn't.

134
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:35,322
Ali.

135
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,795
- Ali?
- Her name.

136
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:42,932
She's cute.

137
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:45,163
Yeah, she's 11 or 12, I don't know.

138
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:48,639
She was born first time
I was in prison. I seen her once.

139
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:50,072
When was that?

140
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,507
When she was 3.

141
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:54,816
- Do you write her?
- I don't know where she is.

142
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:58,053
She's in Texas somewhere.
Foster parents.

143
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,380
Go on and finish up now, Sister.

144
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:05,482
Look.

145
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:08,426
They're about to go
on a killing spree here.

146
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:10,825
They're zapping
this guy Tobias tonight.

147
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,262
Guards are taking bets on who's next.

148
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:15,561
I'm at even odds. It's not good.

149
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:19,172
I got two chances: a pardon board
or a federal appeals court.

150
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:22,900
I wrote the motion on the appeal,
but I need someone to file it.

151
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:24,806
Can you help me with that?

152
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:28,516
You know how to write a motion?

153
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:31,379
You got no choice,
you learn the law real fast.

154
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,078
Call it special motivation.
I've been on death row six years.

155
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:38,020
I studied every law book
I could get my hands on.

156
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,752
I got this stuff about my case:
trial transcripts, legal papers.

157
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:44,659
They might help you get
ahold of my case faster.

158
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,358
You drop a dime and get a lawyer,
we can file a motion for appeal.

159
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,011
- You ain't coming back.
- Are these your only copies?

160
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,043
No, but they're hard to come by.
I don't want to waste them.

161
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:04,218
I'll do my best.
And I appreciate your trust.

162
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:08,451
I'll tell you,
I don't trust nobody in here.

163
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:12,754
But you don't kiss my ass or preach
that hellfire brimstone crap.

164
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:14,360
I respect that.

165
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:15,564
You got guts.

166
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:19,966
You live in a neighborhood
with every nigger carrying a gun.

167
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,267
Come on, Helen, hit it!

168
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:42,085
Playing possum, huh?

169
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:44,519
Think you can trick us,
you dumb animal?

170
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,557
Think you can fool us?

171
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,533
How fast was I going?

172
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:05,508
- Seventy-five miles an hour, ma'am.
- Wow.

173
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:08,976
- You a nun?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,954
Never gave a ticket to no nun before.

175
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:15,988
Gave a ticket to a guy
from the IrS one time.

176
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:18,216
Got audited the next year.

177
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,730
Tell you what, Sister,
I'll let this slide.

178
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:26,935
- But keep your speed down.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:46,883
On Friday night, Walter Delacroix,
age 17, and Hope Percy, 18...

180
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:50,853
...had been two happy people
celebrating a life-turning point.

181
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,558
They were shot twice at close range in
the back of the head with a .22 rifle.

182
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,961
In addition to murder, Poncelet
and Vitello face six counts...

183
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:02,364
...of aggravated kidnapping
and one charge of aggravated rape.

184
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:04,232
-- handcuff the man and molest--

185
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:07,840
-- four weeks before the murder
the two men allegedly cut...

186
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,477
...a wide path of terror
across the area.

187
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:13,876
A police spokesman said today,
in the wake of the murders--

188
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:16,346
Poncelet addressed
the judge as "Cap"...

189
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:20,180
...and smirked when they found him
guilty of murder today.

190
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:23,124
Poncelet claims Vitello
killed both of them.

191
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,758
- Y'all think he's lying.
- Vitello accuses Poncelet.

192
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:31,763
Both say the other did the killing.
Somebody's lying to somebody.

193
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,969
They were both there. We know that.

194
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:37,400
Then how is it possible one guy
gets life, the other death?

195
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:40,498
Probably a stronger case
against Poncelet.

196
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,506
Vitello had a better lawyer.

197
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:45,270
Created a reasonable doubt
in the jury's mind.

198
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:48,210
And Vitello gets life, Poncelet death.

199
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,576
Bad luck.

200
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:52,617
He needs help, Sister.

201
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,220
There's a lawyer, Hilton Barber.

202
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:59,587
He's aware of the case, told me no.
Maybe you can change his mind.

203
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,759
With the aim of a new trial
and getting him out?

204
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:06,024
I'm not sure I want to run
into this guy on the street.

205
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:10,068
He's not getting off.
He was an accomplice. That's life.

206
00:16:10,806 --> 00:16:13,775
Life sentences in a
Louisiana prison is for real.

207
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,569
I'm trying to stop the State
from killing him.

208
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:20,879
You want out?

209
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:22,811
It's cool with me.

210
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:24,948
You don't have to go back there.

211
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:29,949
Get tough on sentencing.
Get tough on lenient parole boards.

212
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:33,620
Get tough on judges
who pass light sentences.

213
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:38,824
- Hello.
- Sister Helen?

214
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:41,536
- Who's this?
- Matt Poncelet.

215
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:46,169
I know I'm on death row, but there's
guys been here years and years.

216
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:49,002
I didn't know this was coming.
They set a date.

217
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:51,405
- For what?
- They're gonna kill me.

218
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:53,547
It's gonna go down on the 13th.

219
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:56,080
You need a lawyer
to get a pardon hearing.

220
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:01,415
I'd do it myself if they'd let me.
But they say, "No lawyer, no hearing. "

221
00:17:01,657 --> 00:17:05,559
I think I know of a lawyer
that may be able to help you.

222
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,557
And I'll do my best, all right?

223
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:10,356
Sister, come through for me.
You're all I got.

224
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,261
They got me on a greased rail
to the death house.

225
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:16,801
I ain't heard from you.
You ain't fading out on me, are you?

226
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,537
I'll get you the lawyer.
Just try not to worry.

227
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:24,412
- I'll call you soon.
- All right. Bye.

228
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:28,174
As far as I'm concerned, it's time
the State got with the program.

229
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:31,511
Call me sentimental,
but I'd rather see him fry.

230
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,915
Barring any last-minute
appeals or stays...

231
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:39,059
...he'll die under the State's new
execution procedure.: lethal injection.

232
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:42,661
- Hello.
- Luis, this is Helen.

233
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:46,230
I need the name of that lawyer
you wanted me to talk to.

234
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:49,137
- How long you been doing this?
- Doing this?

235
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:52,238
- Counseling death row inmates.
- I'm not counseling him.

236
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:55,966
- I hardly know him, just met him once.
- What's your impression?

237
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:58,310
I don't know if I like him.

238
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:01,915
He needs help.
Best thing was to bring him to you.

239
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:03,749
Well, I'll do my best.

240
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:10,358
Courts don't want to hear appeals
on death penalty cases.

241
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:13,083
You can even have
new evidence of innocence...

242
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:17,059
...and the court won't hear the case.
We're the pariahs. We're--

243
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,766
"Have many rabbit."

244
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:22,061
Think that's a "for sale" sign
or a cry for help?

245
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:24,669
Or is it bragging?

246
00:18:25,874 --> 00:18:27,273
lmagine that poor guy.

247
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:30,672
Bought two rabbits a year ago
and now he's overrun.

248
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:33,239
Coming like popcorn.

249
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,349
Day before the governor
runs for reelection...

250
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:41,988
...they set a date for my execution.
Show how tough he is on crime.

251
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:46,024
I agree with you. Politics did
play a big part in this decision.

252
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,957
But the pardon board
isn't a place to bring it up.

253
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:51,598
- Why not?
- It's full of political appointees.

254
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,096
Governor's appointees.

255
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:57,772
They don't want to hear some convicted
killer telling them they is bunk.

256
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:02,500
We have to present you as a person
and convince them to spare your life.

257
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:04,804
We have to prove I'm innocent.

258
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:08,082
We'll file appeals with
the federal and supreme courts...

259
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:09,784
...but this is a pardon board.

260
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:14,079
They won't care if you shot the gun.
They'll be thinking of the crime.

261
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,416
And of you as a monster.

262
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:20,391
It's easy to kill a monster
but hard to kill a human being.

263
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,620
We need people like your mama...

264
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:25,390
...to speak on your behalf.
She should be there.

265
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:29,070
She'll just cry till she can't
say nothing, she gonna be so torn up.

266
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,772
Be that as it may,
your mama should be there.

267
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:35,602
- She'll hear the Delacroixs, the--
- If she's not there--

268
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:37,835
Excuse me for butting in.

269
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:41,541
You're right, it's gonna
be upsetting for her.

270
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:44,344
But she's your mama, Matthew.
Your mama.

271
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:47,521
She should have the opportunity
to speak for her child.

272
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,327
- She'll just blubber her head off.
- Well, she has the right to do that.

273
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:59,094
What if you die and she hasn't
had a chance to speak for you?

274
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:04,202
Don't you think it'll eat at her,
wondering if she could've saved you?

275
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:14,113
I'll think about it,
but I got my pride.

276
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:18,217
I won't kiss ass in front of these
people. I won't kiss nobody's ass.

277
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:32,329
- What are you making, Kenitra?
- An Easter card for Mama.

278
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:36,698
- What's that?
- Easter Bunny going down a chimney.

279
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,408
Happy Easter.

280
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,057
Yes?

281
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:32,954
Mrs. Poncelet?

282
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:34,355
No.

283
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:37,927
Mrs. Poncelet, please.

284
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,364
Don't live here.

285
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:42,298
Who is it?

286
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:47,007
My name is Sister Helen Prejean.
I know your son Matthew.

287
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:52,511
Happy Easter.

288
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,381
- You sure you're a Sister?
- Yes.

289
00:21:57,753 --> 00:22:00,221
- You're not from the TV?
- No.

290
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,855
You sure?

291
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,724
How do you know Mattie?

292
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:11,127
I met him on death row.

293
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:15,703
Well, you never know
who's at your front door.

294
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:21,098
So, what do you want? Mattie send
you for money, for cigarettes?

295
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:22,503
No.

296
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:27,948
So, what do you want?

297
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:34,179
You know they set the date
for Matthew's execution.

298
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:35,390
Yeah.

299
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:39,890
Prison called, said if it goes down,
do I got death insurance?

300
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,063
Ha! What a laugh.

301
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:45,266
I ain't even got food money.

302
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,900
His pardon board hearing
is this Wednesday...

303
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:51,503
...and his lawyer thinks it'd be
a good idea if you were there.

304
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,568
What does Mattie think?

305
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:56,444
He's worried.

306
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:57,942
He wants to protect you.

307
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:00,745
Well, it's a little late for that.

308
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:04,314
That show Inside Crime
did a thing on Mattie...

309
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:07,147
...and told how I tried
to help him and everything.

310
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:09,584
A regular Ma Barker or something.

311
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:11,622
Now I'm famous.

312
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:14,488
Yesterday, I was in the store...

313
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,096
...and I see these
two ladies eyeing me.

314
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:19,698
When I get closer,
I hear one of them say:

315
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:23,831
"I just can't wait to hear that
they have executed that monster...

316
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:25,903
...Matthew Poncelet."

317
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:29,000
That's cruel.

318
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:33,470
My boys are having
a real hard time at school.

319
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:36,280
Kids picking on them.

320
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:38,686
Beating them up, calling them names.

321
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:43,253
Someone put a dead squirrel
inside my little Troy's locker.

322
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:45,858
Poor boy came home crying.

323
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:48,863
What did he ever do to anyone?

324
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:58,468
Just keep trying to figure out
what I done wrong.

325
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:04,869
Life's plowed them over. He started
getting in trouble when he was 15.

326
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:08,048
- Every kid does when he's 15.
- His dad was never around.

327
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:11,548
Most of your kids in the projects
are raised by single parents.

328
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:14,722
They're not raping and killing.
You're being suckered.

329
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:16,423
There you go again, Louie.

330
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,889
What about the parents
of these victims?

331
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:22,688
- Are you seeing and counseling them?
- You think they'd talk to me?

332
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:26,025
Aren't there people in your
neighborhood that need help?

333
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:28,202
Yes, Mom.
I'm still working with them.

334
00:24:28,437 --> 00:24:31,270
Why visit murderers?
They're at the end of the line.

335
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:34,600
For all the energy and resources
you're putting into them...

336
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:37,835
...you could be keeping
other kids from going to prison.

337
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,412
Mama's friends, the Pierres,
read an article...

338
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:43,209
...which mentioned your name
with Poncelet.

339
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:45,181
My name was in the paper?

340
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,116
It has nothing to do with that.
I am just curious.

341
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:50,483
Helen, what has drawn you to this?

342
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,991
Mama, I don't know.

343
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:57,490
I feel caught more than drawn.

344
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:02,533
The man's in trouble and, for some
reason, I'm the only one he trusts.

345
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:04,500
Your heart's in the right place...

346
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,333
...but a full heart
shouldn't follow an empty head.

347
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:09,305
Or an empty stomach.

348
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,810
As a child you always
brought home strays.

349
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:19,146
If we'd taken in all those dogs and
cats, we couldn't have fed the family.

350
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:22,590
Your heart is large.

351
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,287
Just take care that others
don't take advantage of it.

352
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:28,928
I'd hate to see that.

353
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:31,295
All right, Mama.

354
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:34,465
My daddy took me to a bar
when I was 12...

355
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:36,364
...and told me to pick my whiskey.

356
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:39,836
There was all these bottles
behind the bar and I said:

357
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:42,805
"I'll take that one
with the pretty turkey on it."

358
00:25:43,345 --> 00:25:45,711
The guys in the bar
laughed their butts off.

359
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:47,972
We got drunk as coots that night.

360
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,011
My daddy was a good man.
Sharecropper, hard worker.

361
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:55,246
That's the one thing I got from him:
working hands.

362
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,288
- How old were you when he died?
- 14.

363
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:02,521
Why's you a nun?

364
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:04,891
I was drawn to it, I guess.

365
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:09,467
That's a hard question to answer.
It's like asking why you're a convict.

366
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,331
- Bad luck.
- Good luck, then.

367
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:13,767
I had a loving family,
a lot of support.

368
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,570
I guess I felt obliged
to give some of it back.

369
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:19,336
Don't you miss having a man?

370
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:22,516
Don't you want to get married,
fall in love, have sex?

371
00:26:26,288 --> 00:26:28,153
You don't want to talk about it?

372
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:31,282
Well, I have close friends,
men and women.

373
00:26:31,526 --> 00:26:36,225
I haven't experienced sexual intimacy,
but there's other ways of being close.

374
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:39,729
You sharing your dreams,
your thoughts, your feelings.

375
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:42,198
That's being intimate too.

376
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:44,905
We got intimacy right now,
don't we, Sister?

377
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,110
I went to see your mother.

378
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:53,546
She said she'd appear
at the pardon board hearing...

379
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:56,250
...if you want her to.

380
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:01,088
I like being alone with you.

381
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:03,385
You're looking real good to me.

382
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,650
Look at you.

383
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:10,159
Death is breathing down your neck...

384
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:13,662
...and you're playing your
little-man-on-the-make games.

385
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:18,672
I'm not here for your amusement,
Matthew. Show some respect.

386
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:21,933
Why? Because you're a nun
and you wear a little cross?

387
00:27:22,177 --> 00:27:25,943
Because I'm a person.
Every person deserves respect.

388
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:35,715
What's the answer?
What'll it be with your mama?

389
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,188
Mattie had a hard life...

390
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:42,152
...but he was a good boy.

391
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:47,030
When he was 6, he--

392
00:27:49,137 --> 00:27:50,229
He--

393
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:07,679
Ladies and gentlemen, let's be honest.

394
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:10,891
You're not gonna find
many rich people on death row.

395
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:13,959
Matthew Poncelet's here today
because he's poor.

396
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:17,625
Didn't have money so he had
to take what the State gave him.

397
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,495
He got a tax lawyer who'd never
tried a capital case before.

398
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,203
An amateur.

399
00:28:23,438 --> 00:28:27,670
The jury selection took four hours.
The trial lasted five days.

400
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:33,006
The lawyer raised one objection
the entire trial.

401
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:37,415
Now, if Matthew
had himself some money...

402
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:42,486
...well, he could've hired
a team of crackerjack lawyers...

403
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:47,388
...and they would have hired top-notch
investigators, a ballistics expert...

404
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:51,565
...a psychologist to compile
profiles of desirable jurors.

405
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,825
And you can be sure...

406
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,763
...Matthew Poncelet wouldn't be
sitting here today before you...

407
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,804
...asking for his life.

408
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:05,646
The death penalty.

409
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,348
It's nothing new,
been with us for centuries.

410
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:11,677
We've buried people alive,
lopped off their heads...

411
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,753
...burned them alive in public,
gruesome spectacles.

412
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:17,480
I wanted them to see these pictures.

413
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:22,561
In this century, we kept searching
for more and more humane ways...

414
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:24,594
...of killing people we didn't like.

415
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:28,667
We've shot them with firing squads,
suffocated them in gas chambers.

416
00:29:29,204 --> 00:29:30,398
But now...

417
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:34,133
Now we have developed a device...

418
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:37,174
...that is the most humane of all:

419
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,004
Lethal injection.

420
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:43,650
We strap the guy up. We anesthetize
him with shot number one.

421
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:47,082
Then we give him shot number two
which implodes his lungs.

422
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:50,758
And shot number three stops his heart.

423
00:29:51,393 --> 00:29:54,226
We put him to death
just like an old horse.

424
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:56,388
His face just goes to sleep...

425
00:29:56,631 --> 00:30:00,123
...while inside, his organs
are going through Armageddon.

426
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:05,537
His facial muscles would contort, but
shot number one relaxes those muscles.

427
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:08,004
So we don't have to see
any horror show.

428
00:30:08,243 --> 00:30:10,973
We don't have to taste
the blood of revenge...

429
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:16,081
...while this human being's organs
writhe, twist, contort.

430
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:20,780
We just sit there quietly,
nod our heads and say:

431
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:23,287
"Justice has been done."

432
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,394
It has been six years since the
brutal and reprehensible murders...

433
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:31,565
...of Hope Percy and Walter Delacroix.

434
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,763
And justice is long past due.

435
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:38,302
Matt Poncelet has had a lengthy,
thorough court review.

436
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,838
Both a trial and
a retrial for sentencing...

437
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,805
...as well as many appeals
to state and federal courts...

438
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:47,240
...and successive petitions
filed by Mr. Barber.

439
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:51,942
There's been no doubt in the
court's mind about who did the murder.

440
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:58,387
Matthew Poncelet is not a good boy.
He is a heartless killer.

441
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:02,460
These murders were calculated,
disgusting and cruel.

442
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:07,291
This man shot Walter Delacroix
two times in the back of his head.

443
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:10,402
And raped Hope Percy
and stabbed her 17 times...

444
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,233
...before shooting this sweet girl
two times in the back of the head.

445
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,736
These families...

446
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:20,337
...will never see their children
graduate from college.

447
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,642
They will never attend their wedding.

448
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:26,677
They will never have Christmas
with them again.

449
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,379
There will be no grandchildren.

450
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:35,222
All they ask of you is simple justice
for their unbearable loss.

451
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:38,223
I ask you to take a breath...

452
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,661
...steel your spine...

453
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:44,702
...and proceed with the execution
of Matthew Poncelet.

454
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:50,206
It's always a good sign
when you have to wait.

455
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:54,281
- I don't know if we made any headway.
- I thought you did great.

456
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:58,612
It'd be best if they realized their
culpability in the death of a man.

457
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:01,651
- Hilton.
- Excuse me, Sister.

458
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,491
I'm Walter Delacroix's father.

459
00:32:08,997 --> 00:32:13,400
- Mr. Delacroix, I'm sorry about--
- Sister, I'm a Catholic.

460
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:17,571
How can you sit by Poncelet's side
without ever having come to visit...

461
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,569
...with me and my wife
or the Percys to hear our side?

462
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:24,073
How can you spend all your time
worrying about Poncelet...

463
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:26,974
...and not think that maybe
we needed you too?

464
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:32,618
Mr. Delacroix, I didn't think
that you wanted to talk to me.

465
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:34,549
Earl, we're going in.

466
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,521
This is Mary Beth and Clyde Percy.

467
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,162
- I'm sorry about your daughter.
- Yeah, so are we. Excuse us.

468
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:47,798
Listen, Sister...

469
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:52,502
...I'm sure you've seen a side of Matt
Poncelet that none of us has seen.

470
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,801
I'm sure he's on his best behavior,
must be pretty sympathetic to you.

471
00:32:57,045 --> 00:33:00,742
But, Sister, this is an evil man.

472
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:05,476
This is a man who abducted
teenage kids and raped...

473
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,144
...and killed them.

474
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:11,623
That scum robbed me of my only son.

475
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:15,522
My name...
My family name dies with me.

476
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:19,358
There will be no more Delacroixs,
Sister. No more.

477
00:33:20,835 --> 00:33:23,531
I want you to know I do care
about you and your family...

478
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:26,103
...and what happened to your son.

479
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,933
I'm gonna give you my number...

480
00:33:28,176 --> 00:33:32,237
...and if there's anything
that you need, you just call me.

481
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:33,681
Me call you?

482
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,583
Think about that, Sister.
Think about how arrogant that is.

483
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:43,083
Excuse me.

484
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,426
You all right?

485
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:52,661
We better be getting on in.

486
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,413
It is the finding of this board
that clemency...

487
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:12,518
...be denied to Matthew Poncelet.

488
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:16,520
Execution will be carried out
as scheduled one week hence.

489
00:34:17,258 --> 00:34:18,555
Don't give up hope, Matt.

490
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:22,456
We got a judge in the Federal Court
that can put a stop to this.

491
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:25,291
Beyond that there's the
Supreme Court and the governor.

492
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:28,525
I'll get a private meeting
with him if it's the last thing I do.

493
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,260
Looks like you're all I got.

494
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:34,032
I can have a spiritual adviser
of my choice. Will you do it?

495
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:39,004
Ride along into the sunset with me.

496
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,980
You'll have to spend several hours
with him every day as his death nears.

497
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,692
Then on the day of his execution,
you'll have to spend all day with him.

498
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:55,420
It's not an easy job.

499
00:34:55,663 --> 00:35:00,225
Usually, it's done by a chaplain
or a priest or a Moslem cleric.

500
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,765
I want you to be realistic about this.

501
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:09,500
We've got about a one in one thousand
chance things might go our way.

502
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,609
It's a tough road.

503
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:21,018
If that had been a king,
you could go back over, right?

504
00:35:21,255 --> 00:35:24,622
You can jump three this way
then go all the way back.

505
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:28,852
She got that big old bad joker and
won't put it down. That's a shame.

506
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:31,258
My turn. My turn.

507
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:34,092
I got an ace. I'm really lucky.

508
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,433
- Whose was this?
- Mine.

509
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:39,797
Don't kill him. He's a child of God.

510
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,532
He's reformed. He's a poet.
Blah, blah, blah.

511
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:46,406
Attention all ye folks, ye advocates
of killers and child molesters.

512
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,410
Ye opponents of execution.

513
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,947
Ye cannot walk upon the high ground.

514
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:54,086
Ye do not have the moral
authority to walk there.

515
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:56,882
Ye traverse with scum
and scum is where--

516
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:14,564
- What do you want?
- Forgive me for intruding...

517
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:18,108
...but I haven't been able to get
you and your wife out of my mind.

518
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:22,806
I've been trying to call you,
but there's been no answer.

519
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,574
Can I please speak with you?

520
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:26,520
Sure.

521
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:35,619
I'm really sorry for not coming
to visit with you before this...

522
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:40,766
...but I've never been involved
in anything like this before.

523
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:42,401
Truth is you're scared.

524
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:45,464
Yes.

525
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,435
I'd be too.

526
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:52,776
- Come in.
- Thank you.

527
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,384
Well, Sister...

528
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:00,482
...can I ask you a question?

529
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,789
- Are you a communist?
- Communist? No.

530
00:37:07,395 --> 00:37:10,592
I didn't think so.
That's what people around here say...

531
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:15,064
...with you defending this murderer,
but I didn't think so.

532
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,198
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

533
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:27,469
- Care for some coffee?
- Thank you.

534
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,214
I'm sorry about the mess.

535
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,988
My wife and I had a big fight.

536
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:40,052
We got back from the pardon board
hearing.

537
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:45,393
She took Walter's clothes out of his
closet, put them in boxes...

538
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,091
...called Goodwill.

539
00:37:49,203 --> 00:37:52,604
She says she wants
to put the past behind her.

540
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:57,776
She says she has
to move on in her life.

541
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:01,474
She's not herself.

542
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,610
That must be so hard.

543
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,052
When it first happened,
she had me bring her...

544
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:11,019
...to Walter's grave every morning.

545
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:15,188
She wept a river, poor woman.

546
00:38:16,397 --> 00:38:20,458
Whole days, nights, for weeks, months.

547
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:24,434
I wish there was some way...

548
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:28,665
...some key into the past
to change it.

549
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:32,846
It tears me up.

550
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,117
She used to be a ball.

551
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:43,156
We would have us some fun.

552
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:48,228
Some times.

553
00:38:50,631 --> 00:38:51,859
Laugh.

554
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,431
Laugh our heads off.

555
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:10,815
Walter learned to walk
on this floor right here.

556
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:21,825
He busted his chin on the arm
of that sofa right there.

557
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,531
And that love seat right there...

558
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,898
...he sat with Hope...

559
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,800
...a week before they died.

560
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:43,449
When you lose a child...

561
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:48,519
...all the memories get sealed
in a place.

562
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,781
Sealed...

563
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,421
...like a shrine.

564
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:12,771
So you've put in a request...

565
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:15,642
...to be the spiritual adviser
to Matthew Poncelet.

566
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,874
- Yes, Father.
- Why?

567
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,087
He asked me.

568
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:23,555
- This is highly unusual.
- Why?

569
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:27,488
- You'd be the first woman to do it.
- Really?

570
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:31,528
This kind of situation requires
an experienced hand.

571
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:36,901
This boy is to be executed in six days
and is in dire need of redemption.

572
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,637
Are you up to this?

573
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:45,341
I don't know, Father. I hope so.
I've been praying for guidance.

574
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,078
You can save this boy...

575
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:52,649
...by getting him to receive
the sacraments before he dies.

576
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,821
This is your job.

577
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,653
Nothing more, nothing less.

578
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:03,089
If you need any help,
please feel free to call on me.

579
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,729
Thank you, Father.

580
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:09,025
I don't want to be buried here.

581
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,467
They're gonna call my mama,
ask about the funeral arrangements.

582
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:14,765
Could you do it?
My mama'd fall apart.

583
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:16,306
I'll do it.

584
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:22,640
Do you ever read the Bible?

585
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:27,815
I ain't much of a Bible reader,
but I pick it up from time to time.

586
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:31,056
- Like W.C. Fields read his Bible.
- Who?

587
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:34,887
W.C. Fields. He used to play
this drunken character in the movies.

588
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:38,624
He's dying and a friend comes
and sees him reading the Bible.

589
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:42,131
The friend says,
"W.C., you don't believe in God.

590
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,462
Why are you reading the Bible?"

591
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:48,801
And Fields says,
"I'm looking for a loophole."

592
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:55,479
I ain't looking for no loophole.

593
00:41:57,985 --> 00:41:59,680
Rain, rain, rain.

594
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:04,986
That's a bad sign. They already
executed one black, Tobias.

595
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:08,457
Wayne Purcell tonight.
That's two blacks.

596
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,227
Time for a white.

597
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:15,595
The governor's under pressure
to get a white. And that's me!

598
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:21,367
Nigger on the gurney before me.
I hope they clean it before me.

599
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:27,674
- Was your daddy a racist?
- What kind of question is that?

600
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:31,112
- I wonder who taught you to hate.
- I don't like niggers.

601
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:32,649
Have you known any blacks?

602
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:34,855
- They was all around--
- All around?

603
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:36,249
Lived around me.

604
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,549
- Did you ever play with a black child?
- No.

605
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:41,727
- Me and my cousin got jumped once.
- What happened?

606
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:46,831
We was throwing rocks at them.
The next day, they tear our bikes up.

607
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:50,662
- Can you blame them?
- No. But, look, slavery's long over.

608
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:52,839
They're harping
on the bad deal they got.

609
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,540
- The kids?
- All of them.

610
00:42:54,742 --> 00:42:57,006
I hate people who make
themselves out as victims.

611
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:59,178
- Victims?
- Yeah, they all victims.

612
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:03,782
I don't know any victims.
I know some cool people, hard- working.

613
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:07,351
I know a lot of lazy, welfare-taking
coloreds sucking up tax dollars.

614
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,988
- You sound like a politician.
- What's that mean?

615
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:13,989
- Ever been the object of prejudice?
- No.

616
00:43:14,228 --> 00:43:16,719
What do people think
about inmates on death row?

617
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:19,091
- Why don't you tell me?
- They're monsters.

618
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,699
Disposable waste, good-for-nothings
sucking up tax dollars.

619
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:24,734
I ain't no victim. I'm innocent.

620
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:28,874
I ain't whining. I ain't sitting
on a porch going "slavery, slavery."

621
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,474
I like rebels, some blacks.

622
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:33,908
Martin Luther King led people
to D.C., kicked the white man's butt.

623
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:37,242
- You respect Martin Luther King.
- He put up a fight, wasn't lazy.

624
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,951
- Lazy whites?
- Don't like them.

625
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:43,714
- So it's lazy people you don't like.
- Can we talk about something else?

626
00:43:57,771 --> 00:44:01,673
Jesus also said, "He who lives
by the sword shall die by the sword."

627
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:04,377
Purcell had it coming!
He had it coming!

628
00:44:04,578 --> 00:44:07,706
Nine, eight, seven...

629
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:11,145
...six, five, four...

630
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:14,877
...three, two, one.

631
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:27,531
It's the only way we can be sure
that they will not kill again.

632
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:29,895
Life without parole? Oh, sure.

633
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:34,130
How many prison guards do they have
to kill before it's over?

634
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:38,311
These people are mad dogs. Maniacs.

635
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,245
Come on. Let's go.

636
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:50,347
If the governor
and the courts turn us down...

637
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:53,321
...Matt's gonna be dead in six days.

638
00:44:55,863 --> 00:45:00,357
We gotta get us a funeral home
and someplace to bury him.

639
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:05,034
Maybe our sisters will donate
one of their burial plots.

640
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:08,474
Somebody to do the burial service.
Clothes.

641
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,337
I guess a suit.

642
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:13,144
Suit?

643
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:17,716
What size suit do you think he wears?

644
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,481
I don't know.

645
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,456
How tall is he?

646
00:45:26,427 --> 00:45:29,954
I don't know.
I think he's kind of big.

647
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:31,926
What size is kind of big?

648
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:35,624
Does it run like big,
medium and petite?

649
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:45,442
Well, I don't know. I never bought
a man's suit before.

650
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,414
Won't you be a pretty sight?

651
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:51,914
A nun shopping for a man's suit.

652
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:56,653
I'm out of my league.

653
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:59,318
This is so surreal.

654
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:05,691
Hope had just graduated
from high school in early May.

655
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:10,597
She was to join the Air Force
on June 15th.

656
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:12,396
That's the day it happened.

657
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:14,869
She almost got out of Slidell.

658
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:17,907
She was hoping
to get stationed overseas.

659
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:20,244
She liked to travel...

660
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:24,111
...and loved being around people
of different cultures.

661
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:29,480
On June 15th, a recruiting sergeant
was to meet Hope in Slidell...

662
00:46:29,723 --> 00:46:33,181
...and drive her to Baton Rouge
for induction.

663
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:36,759
The day before, I took her shopping
for things she'd need...

664
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:39,295
...you know, just practical things.

665
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:42,426
That evening at 5:00 she dressed...

666
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:45,365
...and went to work
at Corey's where she waitressed.

667
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:50,335
After work, she had a date
with Walter.

668
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:52,545
She was about to leave...

669
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,012
The hem of her skirt was coming out.

670
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:59,549
She was in such a hurry.

671
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:04,013
I pinned it for her with one
of those tiny safety pins.

672
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:06,726
She was gone out the door.

673
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:09,556
You don't know when you see
your child leave...

674
00:47:09,797 --> 00:47:13,460
... that you're never gonna
see them alive again.

675
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:16,493
If I'd known that...

676
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:20,538
...I would have told her
how much I love her.

677
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:24,477
You know, my last words to her...

678
00:47:24,912 --> 00:47:27,574
...the last that she ever heard
from me...

679
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,881
...were about the hem of her skirt.

680
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,350
Next morning we waited
for her to come out.

681
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:39,982
This was Hope's big day.

682
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:43,427
Our baby was leaving home.

683
00:47:43,664 --> 00:47:45,598
Her room was empty...

684
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:49,332
...and the bed was still neatly made.

685
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:53,263
So I telephoned the Delacroixs and...

686
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:56,169
Our hearts sank
when the Delacroixs told us...

687
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,503
...that Walter hadn't come home
that night too.

688
00:47:59,146 --> 00:48:02,513
And then for one brief moment
we thought...

689
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:06,776
...maybe they'd run off
and gotten married.

690
00:48:07,688 --> 00:48:12,148
But we knew that she was just too
sensible to do something like that.

691
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:16,556
I went down to the police and
filled out a missing person's form.

692
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:22,000
Three days later the sheriff
formed a search party.

693
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:24,033
I went along with them.

694
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:28,571
They were gone all day.
They walked for miles and nothing.

695
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:31,437
On Thursday, June 20th...

696
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:34,544
...some kids were out
near Flank's Cove...

697
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:39,445
...and they found a purse
and some clothing and a wallet.

698
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:41,153
They turned them in to the police.

699
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:45,521
They found the kids' bodies
on Friday...

700
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,592
...six days after they'd gone missing.

701
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:53,225
My daughter's body was nude...

702
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:55,435
...legs spread-eagle.

703
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:00,869
Coroner's report said
that her vagina was all tore up.

704
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,878
At first they couldn't find
this class pin she was wearing...

705
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:10,379
...because it was embedded so deep,
from the stabbing.

706
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:13,112
She loved that pin.

707
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:16,481
She was so proud of it,
and she wore it all the time.

708
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:21,687
It said, "Class of '88
making a difference."

709
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:27,163
The police wouldn't let us go down
to the morgue and identify the body.

710
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:29,369
They said it would be too traumatic.

711
00:49:29,603 --> 00:49:31,127
But I just couldn't...

712
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:35,330
...bear the thought
of them burying that body...

713
00:49:35,576 --> 00:49:39,307
...without making absolutely and
positively sure that that was Hope.

714
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,780
I called my brother, he's a dentist.

715
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:45,507
I asked him to go
to the funeral home...

716
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:48,243
...and make an I.D. from dental records.

717
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:51,252
Before he'd stuck his hand
into that bag...

718
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:56,258
...with all that lime in it
and fished Hope's jaw out...

719
00:49:57,564 --> 00:49:59,862
...he'd been against
the death penalty.

720
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:03,701
And after that, he was all for it.

721
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:08,172
I knew it had to be Hope.

722
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:13,311
That's what my mind told me, you know,
but I just, I had to be sure.

723
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:31,224
- This is Sister Helen Prejean.
- Hello.

724
00:50:31,965 --> 00:50:35,298
- Nice to meet you, Emily.
- Okay.

725
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:37,603
Okay.

726
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:40,830
Let's go in the kitchen.
I'll make us some coffee.

727
00:50:50,684 --> 00:50:54,620
I met Poncelet face to face
in the hallway during the trial.

728
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:57,187
I ain't gonna get no chair, Daddy.

729
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:00,951
You're gonna fry,
and I'm gonna watch you sizzle.

730
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:04,764
There was a sheriff standing
pretty close by me.

731
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:09,031
I could have grabbed his gun and shot
Poncelet right then and there.

732
00:51:09,703 --> 00:51:13,264
I could've killed him on that day,
and I wished I would have.

733
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:16,202
I'd be a happier man today.

734
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:23,415
So, what made you change your mind?

735
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,742
Change my mind?

736
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:27,512
What made you come around to our side?

737
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:42,228
I wanted to come and see if I could
help y'all and pray with you.

738
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:43,766
Thank you.

739
00:51:50,844 --> 00:51:55,577
But he asked me to be his spiritual
adviser, to be with him when he dies.

740
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,144
And what did you say?

741
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:01,353
That I would.

742
00:52:02,689 --> 00:52:04,623
We thought you'd changed your mind.

743
00:52:05,892 --> 00:52:08,087
We thought that's why you were here.

744
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:12,298
No.

745
00:52:16,036 --> 00:52:19,130
- How can you come here?
- How can you do that?

746
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,434
How can you sit with that scum?

747
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:26,407
Mr. Percy, I've never done
this before.

748
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:28,113
I'm trying...

749
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:32,312
I'm trying to follow
the example of Jesus...

750
00:52:33,787 --> 00:52:37,223
...who said that every person
is worth...

751
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:39,925
...more than their worst act.

752
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,561
This is not a person.
This is an animal.

753
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:47,631
No, I take that back. Animals don't
rape and murder their own kind!

754
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:51,398
Matthew Poncelet is God's mistake.

755
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:55,937
And you want to hold
the poor murderer's hand?

756
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,644
You want to comfort him when he dies?

757
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:01,814
There wasn't anybody in the woods
to comfort Hope...

758
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:05,108
...when those two animals pushed
her face into the grass!

759
00:53:06,086 --> 00:53:10,079
I just want to help him take
responsibility for what he did.

760
00:53:10,323 --> 00:53:13,815
Does he admit to what he did?
Is he sorry?

761
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:16,328
He says he didn't kill anybody.

762
00:53:16,563 --> 00:53:18,554
You're in waters way over your head.

763
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:21,427
You don't know what
it's like to carry a child...

764
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:26,628
...and give birth and get up with a
sick child in the middle of the night.

765
00:53:27,007 --> 00:53:28,998
You pray and get a good night's sleep.

766
00:53:29,342 --> 00:53:32,470
My parents raised me
to respect the religious.

767
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:35,542
Sister, you need to leave
this house right now.

768
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:37,784
I'm--

769
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:40,382
Wait a minute!

770
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:43,080
If you really are sorry...

771
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:44,950
...and do care about this family...

772
00:53:45,192 --> 00:53:47,786
...you'll want to see justice done
for our murdered child!

773
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:50,119
Now, you can't have it both ways!

774
00:53:50,363 --> 00:53:53,890
You can't befriend that murderer
and expect to be our friend too.

775
00:53:54,134 --> 00:53:57,934
You brought the enemy into this house,
Sister. You gotta go.

776
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:13,144
I come from a good family.
My family can't be blamed.

777
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:16,412
I had two families.
Both of them I'd love and die for.

778
00:54:16,656 --> 00:54:20,786
- Your other family is...?
- The family of man. Of men in prison.

779
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:22,927
My white family,
the Aryan Brotherhood.

780
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,823
You're a white supremacist?
A follower of Hitler?

781
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:28,899
He was a leader. I admire him
for getting things done.

782
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:31,035
Like Castro, he got things done.

783
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,364
Hitler might have gone overboard
on the killing...

784
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:35,905
...but he was on the right track.

785
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:38,770
The right track?
The murder of 6 million Jews?

786
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:43,313
What am I doing with this guy?
I must be nuts.

787
00:54:51,524 --> 00:54:53,617
- Hello?
- Sister? It's Hilton Barber.

788
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,953
We need you
for a strategy meeting.

789
00:54:57,731 --> 00:54:59,562
"In an interview with the Times...

790
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:02,324
...Poncelet says that
if he had to do it again...

791
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:05,402
...he'd do something useful
like join a terrorist group...

792
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,766
...and bomb government buildings."

793
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:11,103
We must get him off
this political prisoner kick.

794
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:14,313
Henry, how close are we
on the Supreme Court docket?

795
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:17,380
- In a couple of days.
- We don't have a couple of days!

796
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:20,814
- We don't have the legal staff.
- You had it for three days.

797
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:24,717
- Where were you yesterday?
- I had to take my kid to the dentist.

798
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:26,983
A man is gonna die on death row and--

799
00:55:27,227 --> 00:55:30,060
Yeah, well, my kid needed
to hold her daddy's hand.

800
00:55:30,297 --> 00:55:33,960
If you don't like it, find another
lawyer to volunteer his time.

801
00:55:40,558 --> 00:55:43,254
People reading these interviews
think you're a nut.

802
00:55:43,494 --> 00:55:47,430
Admiring Hitler, wanting to come back
as a terrorist and blow people up?

803
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:50,463
I said government buildings,
not people.

804
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:52,794
Bombing a building won't hurt people?

805
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,730
I ain't got no love
for the government is all.

806
00:55:55,973 --> 00:55:59,807
You're a fool. You are making it
so easy for them to kill you.

807
00:56:00,044 --> 00:56:02,035
Coming across as some crazed animal...

808
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:05,043
...Nazi, racist mad dog
who deserves to die.

809
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:08,809
- Is that what you think?
- You're making it so hard to help you.

810
00:56:09,186 --> 00:56:10,153
You can leave.

811
00:56:10,755 --> 00:56:12,382
I'm not gonna do that.

812
00:56:14,058 --> 00:56:16,549
It's up to you.
You want me to go, you say so.

813
00:56:24,502 --> 00:56:28,233
- Do you ever think about those kids?
- It's terrible what happened.

814
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:30,736
Especially since it didn't
have to happen.

815
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:34,308
Do you ever think about what
you did to their parents' lives?

816
00:56:34,545 --> 00:56:36,445
It's hard to have sympathy for them...

817
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,376
- ...when they're trying to kill me.
- Think about it.

818
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:42,814
Their kids are shot, stabbed, raped...

819
00:56:43,053 --> 00:56:45,851
...left in the woods to die alone.

820
00:56:46,423 --> 00:56:49,153
How'd you feel if somebody
did that to your family?

821
00:56:49,393 --> 00:56:53,056
- What would you do to them?
- I'd sure as hell want to kill them.

822
00:56:53,297 --> 00:56:56,425
I understand them, but they're
calling for the wrong head.

823
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,658
I want to take a lie detector test.

824
00:56:58,903 --> 00:57:01,030
I know it won't change
them guys' minds...

825
00:57:01,272 --> 00:57:04,969
...but I want my mama to know
I didn't kill any kids.

826
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:14,678
The boy's good!

827
00:57:15,319 --> 00:57:16,547
Go.

828
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:22,621
- Hey, y'all. Having a party.
- Hey.

829
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,884
Palmer.

830
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:26,358
- Herbie, how's your side feeling?
- Okay.

831
00:57:26,597 --> 00:57:29,760
- Yeah? Kenitra, how are you doing?
- Fine.

832
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,592
Come on, Kenitra, let's go.

833
00:57:31,836 --> 00:57:33,303
Bye-bye.

834
00:57:35,606 --> 00:57:37,506
Wait a minute, what happened?

835
00:57:38,943 --> 00:57:41,036
There's talk in the neighborhood...

836
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:45,544
...of Poncelet's racist comments.
Your name was in the article.

837
00:57:45,783 --> 00:57:47,444
Oh, Lord.

838
00:57:48,118 --> 00:57:50,245
The learning center also misses you.

839
00:57:50,487 --> 00:57:53,581
They think you care more
about him than your classes.

840
00:57:56,327 --> 00:58:00,058
- Colleen, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. I still love you.

841
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:02,629
I just thought you should know.

842
00:58:03,434 --> 00:58:04,594
Oh!

843
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,135
Got this at Goodwill.

844
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:15,406
Talked to Bishop Norwich.
He said he would say the funeral mass.

845
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:20,110
Also found a funeral home
willing to donate their services.

846
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:24,720
The leaders of the congregation met.
We can use one of our burial plots.

847
00:58:25,689 --> 00:58:27,520
If Matt dies...

848
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,093
...guess who he'll be buried next to?

849
00:58:30,327 --> 00:58:33,455
- Who was the last person to die?
- Sister Celestine.

850
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:35,665
Oh, Lord.

851
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,232
Remember when that girl
came to the convent...

852
00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:40,232
...to introduce her husband to us?

853
00:58:40,471 --> 00:58:44,202
Celestine said, "I'm glad I won't
have to share my bed with a man."

854
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:47,706
- She loved her celibacy so much.
- And now...

855
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:52,276
She's gonna be lying next to a man
for all eternity.

856
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:13,100
My daughter's killer can possibly
get out on parole in another year--

857
00:59:13,337 --> 00:59:18,104
Recently, my wife and I went
to the sheriff's office--

858
00:59:18,342 --> 00:59:22,005
I just can't bear the thought
of him being out, a free man...

859
00:59:22,246 --> 00:59:24,976
...and her buried in the ground
and dead forever.

860
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:27,274
"Don't know nothing
about these-- "

861
00:59:27,518 --> 00:59:30,146
-- was killed
by her ex-husband, you know.

862
00:59:30,387 --> 00:59:35,586
-- stabbed to death in our back yard
by my son's best friend.

863
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:40,058
He'd spent the night at our house and
gone to church with us that morning.

864
00:59:41,065 --> 00:59:42,089
I lost my child--

865
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:45,496
Her little skiing outfit
is still in the closet.

866
00:59:45,936 --> 00:59:50,873
When our child was killed, it took
over a week to find her body.

867
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:52,735
-- staring out the window.

868
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:56,936
The D A's office treated us
like we were the criminals.

869
00:59:57,181 --> 00:59:59,081
My wife...

870
00:59:59,783 --> 01:00:02,775
...filed for divorce this afternoon.

871
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:09,456
We just have different ways
of dealing with our son's death.

872
01:00:12,896 --> 01:00:15,126
"Until death do us part."

873
01:00:17,668 --> 01:00:19,363
We're nothing special.

874
01:00:20,437 --> 01:00:23,270
Most folks that lose a kid split up.

875
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:25,741
Seventy percent or something.

876
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:29,709
I just wish I could laugh,
find something funny.

877
01:00:31,382 --> 01:00:32,872
This is my car.

878
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:37,278
Thanks for inviting me, Mr. Delacroix.

879
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:41,120
You take care, Sister.

880
01:00:41,392 --> 01:00:42,586
Good night.

881
01:01:32,009 --> 01:01:35,069
What the fuck you doing?
What you doing?

882
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:12,409
Raise your arms.

883
01:02:16,887 --> 01:02:17,979
Go ahead.

884
01:02:22,025 --> 01:02:23,822
Have a seat in that chair.

885
01:02:43,313 --> 01:02:44,974
Like my new digs?

886
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:48,475
Hi.

887
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:54,152
I'm pretty special, huh?

888
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:57,960
I'm pretty special.
Have this place all to myself.

889
01:03:00,898 --> 01:03:03,264
They got like 10 guards guarding me.

890
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:07,495
One guy comes every 15 minutes
to see if I killed myself.

891
01:03:07,738 --> 01:03:08,796
Suicide watch.

892
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,734
Suicide watch.

893
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:15,603
Never had so many people
caring about what I was doing.

894
01:03:17,014 --> 01:03:18,845
When did they bring you here?

895
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,778
Last night.

896
01:03:21,018 --> 01:03:22,076
Late.

897
01:03:23,086 --> 01:03:26,385
Didn't get to say goodbye
to most of the guys on the row.

898
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:29,251
Did you take care of that
lie detector test yet?

899
01:03:29,493 --> 01:03:32,929
I made some calls,
but I haven't had any luck yet.

900
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:38,394
So this is the end, huh?

901
01:03:38,936 --> 01:03:40,699
My death house vacation.

902
01:03:41,305 --> 01:03:44,297
Three days of quiet.
Plenty of time to read my Bible.

903
01:03:44,675 --> 01:03:46,336
Look for a loophole.

904
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:49,970
Look for a loophole.

905
01:03:55,385 --> 01:03:58,115
Did you read anything
about Jesus in that Bible?

906
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:06,027
Holy Man. Did good. In heaven.

907
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,688
Praise Jesus.

908
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:12,693
There are some passages in there...

909
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:14,995
...about when Jesus
was facing death alone...

910
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:17,070
...that you might want to check out.

911
01:04:17,307 --> 01:04:19,969
Me and Jesus have a different way
of doing things.

912
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,701
He's one of them
turn-the-other-cheek guys.

913
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:27,417
It takes a lot of strength
to turn the other cheek.

914
01:04:28,151 --> 01:04:31,177
You say you like rebels.
What do you think Jesus was?

915
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:34,481
- He wasn't no rebel.
- Sure He was. He was a dangerous man.

916
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:38,718
- "Love your brother" is dangerous?
- Because His love changed things.

917
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:41,795
His love changed things.

918
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:46,101
The people nobody cared about: the
prostitutes, the beggars, the poor.

919
01:04:46,336 --> 01:04:49,362
They finally had somebody
who respected them, loved them...

920
01:04:49,606 --> 01:04:52,404
...made them realize their own worth.

921
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,137
They had dignity and became powerful.

922
01:04:55,379 --> 01:04:57,870
The guys on the top got real nervous.

923
01:04:58,115 --> 01:05:00,310
So they had to kill Jesus.

924
01:05:01,785 --> 01:05:03,082
Kind of like me, huh?

925
01:05:05,188 --> 01:05:06,883
No, Matt, not--

926
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:09,450
Not at all like you.

927
01:05:09,693 --> 01:05:13,754
He changed the world with His love.
You watched as two kids were murdered.

928
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:18,698
Step back from the door, Sister.

929
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:21,000
Why? What's happening?

930
01:05:26,443 --> 01:05:27,808
Move it on out, boy.

931
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:29,376
What's this now?

932
01:05:29,946 --> 01:05:31,174
What's this?

933
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:37,111
He'll be an hour.
Why don't you get some air?

934
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:40,187
- Where are they taking him?
- I can't tell you.

935
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:56,862
Sister Helen?
Chaplain Farley called from the gate.

936
01:05:57,107 --> 01:05:58,938
- He'll be right here.
- Thank you.

937
01:05:59,176 --> 01:06:00,336
Sergeant Trapp?

938
01:06:00,577 --> 01:06:04,104
How long do you think that
big old tree's been standing there?

939
01:06:04,915 --> 01:06:07,611
Ma'am, there ain't no telling.

940
01:06:08,919 --> 01:06:12,514
Saw you outside the gates the other
night at Purcell's execution.

941
01:06:12,756 --> 01:06:13,814
Yeah?

942
01:06:14,324 --> 01:06:15,291
You seemed upset.

943
01:06:15,525 --> 01:06:16,890
Upset? No.

944
01:06:17,694 --> 01:06:22,290
- You in the room when they did it?
- I'm on the strap- down team, left leg.

945
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:24,159
That's my job. The left leg.

946
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,529
I take the prisoner from his cell
to the execution chamber.

947
01:06:28,004 --> 01:06:29,494
Wow, that's gotta be tough.

948
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,207
It's hard.

949
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:33,508
I didn't sleep that night.

950
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:37,578
I think it's gotta affect
everybody that sees it...

951
01:06:37,814 --> 01:06:39,873
...whether they're for it or against.

952
01:06:40,117 --> 01:06:41,744
It's just part of the job.

953
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:44,584
These prisoners gets
what's coming to them.

954
01:06:45,122 --> 01:06:47,283
It's easy for someone
to come and make...

955
01:06:47,524 --> 01:06:49,754
...a rash judgement on procedure.

956
01:06:49,993 --> 01:06:54,362
What may appear on the surface
to be irrational or unnecessary...

957
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:57,499
...proves upon examination
to have solid reasoning...

958
01:06:57,734 --> 01:07:00,066
...and experience behind it.

959
01:07:00,537 --> 01:07:03,938
All I'm asking is to play a hymn
for Matt before his execution.

960
01:07:04,174 --> 01:07:07,632
And experience tells us
that music stirs up emotion.

961
01:07:07,978 --> 01:07:12,415
Emotion that can produce
an unexpected reaction in the inmate.

962
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:13,716
All right.

963
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:17,545
Do you have any objection to my asking
the warden for his opinion?

964
01:07:19,256 --> 01:07:22,987
I would oppose it,
but you may if you like.

965
01:07:24,528 --> 01:07:26,894
Thank you.
And thank you for your time.

966
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:31,226
I hear you were protesting outside
the gates during the last execution.

967
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:34,665
- Yes.
- You familiar with the Old Testament?

968
01:07:35,472 --> 01:07:37,440
"Thou shalt not kill."

969
01:07:37,674 --> 01:07:39,904
"If anyone sheds the blood of man...

970
01:07:40,444 --> 01:07:42,605
...by man, shall his blood be shed."

971
01:07:42,846 --> 01:07:44,939
Are you familiar
with the New Testament...

972
01:07:45,182 --> 01:07:48,481
...where Jesus talks
about grace and reconciliation?

973
01:07:48,718 --> 01:07:52,984
Poncelet has to understand
that Jesus died for his sins.

974
01:07:53,223 --> 01:07:54,315
If he accepts that...

975
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:59,391
...reconciliation is his
and his soul shall have eternal life.

976
01:07:59,629 --> 01:08:03,690
One's opinion of the death penalty
is not the issue here.

977
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:06,068
Look at Romans.

978
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:10,000
"Let every person be subordinate
to the higher authorities.

979
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,869
For there is no authority,
except from God.

980
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:18,638
And those who oppose it
will bring judgment upon themselves."

981
01:08:19,282 --> 01:08:20,249
What happened?

982
01:08:20,484 --> 01:08:22,475
- She collapsed.
- She had a heart attack.

983
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,654
- I'm okay. I think I just fainted.
- No, don't you move.

984
01:08:25,889 --> 01:08:27,652
I'm hungry. I just need to eat.

985
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:38,830
I told Matt I'd be back.
Could you tell him what happened?

986
01:08:39,069 --> 01:08:41,765
- When we're finished here.
- I've gotta tell him now.

987
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:43,905
I'll take care of it, Sister.

988
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:46,506
- Thank you.
- This isn't a heart attack.

989
01:08:47,077 --> 01:08:49,944
I'm just hungry.
They don't let visitors eat here.

990
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:54,082
They must think we're some kind of
ferns that feed on air or something.

991
01:08:55,852 --> 01:08:58,719
Is that the machine
that they use after an execution?

992
01:08:58,955 --> 01:09:00,149
Yes, ma'am.

993
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:03,120
Just have to be official
about the whole thing.

994
01:09:03,627 --> 01:09:07,290
Thank God we're off the chair.
It's a bit easier to take the needle.

995
01:09:07,531 --> 01:09:11,058
Just part of the job.
Let's get some food in your stomach.

996
01:09:11,301 --> 01:09:12,598
Who puts the needle in?

997
01:09:13,703 --> 01:09:15,193
That's private information.

998
01:09:15,772 --> 01:09:16,830
Is it you?

999
01:09:18,475 --> 01:09:22,878
We cannot disclose any specifics
regarding execution procedure.

1000
01:09:24,281 --> 01:09:27,682
Let me get you a tray of food
and then we'll send you on home.

1001
01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:30,546
- I've gotta get back to Matt.
- I'm sorry, Sister.

1002
01:09:30,787 --> 01:09:33,654
This is warden's orders.
You're through for the day.

1003
01:09:37,527 --> 01:09:39,552
- Where'd you go?
- I couldn't come back.

1004
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:40,956
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1005
01:09:41,197 --> 01:09:44,564
I kept asking what happened.
I thought you had a heart attack.

1006
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:47,736
- They said they'd tell you.
- They took me into that room.

1007
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:49,666
- They was weighing me.
- What for?

1008
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:51,567
To see how big a coffin I need.

1009
01:09:51,808 --> 01:09:55,437
Then I come back and you were gone.
I spent the whole day alone.

1010
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,010
I'm sorry.

1011
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:00,841
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:10:06,022 --> 01:10:08,991
- You ever get lonely?
- Yeah. Sure.

1013
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:19,701
Sometimes when I smell the smoke
from the neighborhood barbecues...

1014
01:10:19,936 --> 01:10:22,905
...and I hear all the kids laughing...

1015
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:26,802
...and I'm sitting in my room,
I feel like a fool.

1016
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,138
What I miss most being here? Women.

1017
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:39,779
You know, I used to sit at the bar,
just drinking and listening to music.

1018
01:10:40,023 --> 01:10:42,253
I'd dance till 3:00 in the morning.

1019
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:45,021
I ain't gonna lie.
I believe in doing it.

1020
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:47,991
My lady and I'd grab
a bottle, blanket, some weed...

1021
01:10:48,231 --> 01:10:50,722
...go out in the woods,
and we'd do it.

1022
01:10:51,468 --> 01:10:53,333
It's something you miss, ma'am.

1023
01:10:55,305 --> 01:10:57,671
Let's face it, Matt.
If I had a family...

1024
01:10:57,907 --> 01:11:01,741
...chances are I'd be with them now
instead of visiting with you.

1025
01:11:01,978 --> 01:11:03,240
True enough.

1026
01:11:04,214 --> 01:11:05,806
I'm glad you're here.

1027
01:11:11,287 --> 01:11:13,755
You want me to get a message
to your daughter?

1028
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:22,020
Let her be.

1029
01:11:26,603 --> 01:11:28,468
Those things will kill you.

1030
01:11:32,976 --> 01:11:34,671
I won't let them break me.

1031
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:39,409
I just pray God holds up my legs
on my last walk.

1032
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:42,413
It's the wait.
It's the countdown that gets to you.

1033
01:11:45,021 --> 01:11:47,489
We'll know soon
about the federal appeal.

1034
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:51,057
Hilton and I got an appointment
with the governor this evening.

1035
01:11:51,294 --> 01:11:54,559
Fat chance he'll do anything.
Risk his political butt for me?

1036
01:11:54,798 --> 01:11:58,598
I wish I hadn't said all that shit
about Hitler and being a terrorist.

1037
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:00,132
Stupid!

1038
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:05,568
Hartman says there won't be
any more media interviews.

1039
01:12:05,809 --> 01:12:09,643
Good. Keep my stupid mouth shut.

1040
01:12:14,117 --> 01:12:17,518
I was able to arrange a lie detector
test for tomorrow morning.

1041
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,688
All right. There's some good news.

1042
01:12:20,156 --> 01:12:22,090
The man that's gonna give the test...

1043
01:12:22,325 --> 01:12:25,294
...doubts they'll get
an accurate reading of the truth.

1044
01:12:25,528 --> 01:12:28,190
- Why?
- Tomorrow's the day of your execution.

1045
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:32,231
You'll be stressed. The test
often mistakes stress for dishonesty.

1046
01:12:32,535 --> 01:12:34,400
No problem. I'm home free.

1047
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:39,804
You been reading your Bible?

1048
01:12:41,811 --> 01:12:43,779
I tried to last night.

1049
01:12:45,014 --> 01:12:46,777
Makes me want to sleep.

1050
01:12:47,484 --> 01:12:49,349
I'm trying to stay conscious.

1051
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:56,986
I appreciate you trying to save me...

1052
01:12:57,227 --> 01:13:00,321
...but me and God,
we got our thing squared away.

1053
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,795
Jesus died on the cross for us.

1054
01:13:03,032 --> 01:13:07,492
And I hold He'll take care of me when
I appear before God on Judgment Day.

1055
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:12,635
Matt, redemption isn't some
kind of free admission ticket...

1056
01:13:12,876 --> 01:13:14,844
...you get because
Jesus paid the price.

1057
01:13:15,078 --> 01:13:17,478
You gotta participate
in your own redemption.

1058
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:20,444
You got some work to do.

1059
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:25,911
I think maybe you should look
at John, chapter 8, where Jesus said:

1060
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:28,589
"You shall know the truth...

1061
01:13:28,825 --> 01:13:31,293
...and the truth shall make you free."

1062
01:13:33,863 --> 01:13:37,299
I'll check it out. I like that.
"The truth shall make you free."

1063
01:13:37,534 --> 01:13:38,694
I like that.

1064
01:13:39,569 --> 01:13:42,538
So I pass that lie detector test,
I'm home free.

1065
01:13:47,777 --> 01:13:49,438
If you do die...

1066
01:13:50,547 --> 01:13:52,708
...I want to help you die
with dignity.

1067
01:13:52,949 --> 01:13:54,041
You can't do that...

1068
01:13:54,284 --> 01:13:58,482
...unless you own up to the part you
played in Walter and Hope's death.

1069
01:14:17,774 --> 01:14:19,833
- Hilton Barber, Bishop Norwich.
- Hello.

1070
01:14:20,076 --> 01:14:22,271
Pleasure, Bishop.
Here's the situation.

1071
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:26,676
Governor Benedict is a reluctant
supporter of capital punishment.

1072
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:30,044
He has the power to stop
this execution and save a life.

1073
01:14:30,286 --> 01:14:33,016
It's the last vestige
of the divine right of kings.

1074
01:14:33,256 --> 01:14:35,383
The trick is, we have
to appeal to him...

1075
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:37,957
...on a personal level,
without any fanfare.

1076
01:14:38,194 --> 01:14:40,162
So I requested a private meeting.

1077
01:14:40,396 --> 01:14:45,163
You must understand. In representing
the State, I must carry out the laws...

1078
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:48,704
...and must submerge
my own personal views...

1079
01:14:48,938 --> 01:14:51,031
...to carry out the will
of the people.

1080
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:52,866
I'll look at this case.

1081
01:14:53,376 --> 01:14:58,211
But unless there's some clear,
striking evidence for innocence...

1082
01:14:58,681 --> 01:15:01,047
...I will not interfere
with the process.

1083
01:15:03,853 --> 01:15:05,844
We still got the court, Sister.

1084
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:10,090
We might hit pay dirt
on one of the legal issues.

1085
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:15,822
Helen.

1086
01:15:16,266 --> 01:15:18,598
Helen, come to dinner.

1087
01:15:19,969 --> 01:15:24,235
You're looking for a love
that's so big, it takes in all evil.

1088
01:15:24,908 --> 01:15:26,842
Annunciations are common.

1089
01:15:27,076 --> 01:15:28,873
Incarnations are rare.

1090
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:30,943
You're not a saint, Helen.

1091
01:15:36,786 --> 01:15:39,448
Helen. Helen.

1092
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:44,517
Oh, Mama.

1093
01:15:46,162 --> 01:15:47,493
Are you okay?

1094
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:50,130
Oh, yes. I was just dreaming.

1095
01:15:51,901 --> 01:15:54,131
What time do you have to be there?

1096
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:55,337
9:00 sharp.

1097
01:15:55,939 --> 01:15:57,634
Did you set a clock?

1098
01:15:57,874 --> 01:15:59,000
Yeah.

1099
01:16:00,743 --> 01:16:03,576
Oh, it's so bizarre.

1100
01:16:05,448 --> 01:16:08,349
A man's gonna be killed
in front of me tomorrow.

1101
01:16:10,486 --> 01:16:12,454
Has he admitted anything?

1102
01:16:12,689 --> 01:16:14,054
Oh, no.

1103
01:16:15,191 --> 01:16:19,855
He's so full of hate,
he doesn't trust anybody. He just--

1104
01:16:20,363 --> 01:16:22,661
He keeps pushing me away.

1105
01:16:25,168 --> 01:16:27,033
You're in deep water, kid.

1106
01:16:29,138 --> 01:16:31,834
Do you remember
when you gave me a black eye?

1107
01:16:32,342 --> 01:16:33,309
I had a fever.

1108
01:16:33,543 --> 01:16:36,842
You were delirious,
hysterical, screaming.

1109
01:16:38,247 --> 01:16:40,943
You were trying to get up
and run into the street.

1110
01:16:43,152 --> 01:16:46,417
You socked me in the eye
and you said you hated me.

1111
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:49,849
You screamed, but I held you.
I held you tight.

1112
01:16:50,093 --> 01:16:52,687
Because a mother's arms are strong...

1113
01:16:53,196 --> 01:16:54,993
...when her child's in danger.

1114
01:17:13,182 --> 01:17:15,514
I didn't sleep at all last night.

1115
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:20,083
I didn't take that nerve medicine
they wanted to give me.

1116
01:17:21,424 --> 01:17:24,825
I'm looking death in the eyes.
I mean, I'm getting ready to go.

1117
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:34,962
Listen, Matt, I want you to know
that I respect your need for privacy.

1118
01:17:36,105 --> 01:17:39,666
If you want to be alone or want
to be just with your family today...

1119
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:41,604
...I won't be offended.

1120
01:17:41,844 --> 01:17:43,744
Be there, if it won't put you out.

1121
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,778
I want somebody to talk to
and be there to the end.

1122
01:17:47,183 --> 01:17:48,480
I'll be there.

1123
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,255
If only I knew I'd die right away
with the first shot.

1124
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:56,117
I mean, will I feel it?

1125
01:18:02,231 --> 01:18:05,496
The lungs go first. Like a...

1126
01:18:06,669 --> 01:18:08,261
...fast choke.

1127
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,364
That's gotta hurt.

1128
01:18:15,878 --> 01:18:17,277
They say that...

1129
01:18:19,348 --> 01:18:21,043
...the body doesn't move.

1130
01:18:22,885 --> 01:18:24,512
Doesn't shake.

1131
01:18:32,495 --> 01:18:33,985
My poor mama.

1132
01:18:40,169 --> 01:18:41,864
Any word from the 5th Circuit?

1133
01:18:42,105 --> 01:18:44,232
None yet. But that's a good sign.

1134
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:48,501
Maybe that means they see
something substantive in the petition.

1135
01:18:48,911 --> 01:18:51,175
- Gotta go. I'll call later.
- Thanks, Hilton.

1136
01:18:51,414 --> 01:18:52,642
- Bye.
- Bye.

1137
01:18:55,718 --> 01:18:57,686
Tell me something, Sister.

1138
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,287
What is a nun doing
in a place like this?

1139
01:19:01,524 --> 01:19:03,719
Shouldn't you be teaching children?

1140
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,292
And you know what this man has done.

1141
01:19:06,596 --> 01:19:08,086
How he killed them kids.

1142
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:12,601
What he did was evil.
I don't condone it.

1143
01:19:12,835 --> 01:19:15,770
What's the sense in killing
to say killing is wrong?

1144
01:19:16,005 --> 01:19:18,667
You know how the Bible says,
"an eye for an eye"?

1145
01:19:18,908 --> 01:19:20,375
Know what else it asks for?

1146
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:23,204
Death as a punishment
for adultery, prostitution...

1147
01:19:23,446 --> 01:19:25,710
...homosexuality,
trespass upon sacred ground...

1148
01:19:25,948 --> 01:19:28,439
...profaning the Sabbath
and contempt of parents.

1149
01:19:28,684 --> 01:19:32,950
I ain't gonna get in no Bible quoting
with no nun because I'm gonna lose.

1150
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:47,791
She was only on the phone
a few minutes and there she was...

1151
01:19:48,037 --> 01:19:50,403
...falling for the old Matt charm.

1152
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:55,436
I had to take back that phone. You're
trying to steal my gal, you dog.

1153
01:19:55,678 --> 01:19:58,078
She sounds like a great little gal.

1154
01:19:58,314 --> 01:20:01,078
- She ain't so little, though.
- You shut up.

1155
01:20:01,484 --> 01:20:04,009
Take care of her, Craig.
Don't do nothing stupid.

1156
01:20:04,253 --> 01:20:05,982
She looks a little bit like...

1157
01:20:06,222 --> 01:20:08,383
Who was your girlfriend
in high school?

1158
01:20:08,858 --> 01:20:10,826
I had lots of girls in high school.

1159
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,688
- No, the one with the funny name.
- Funny name?

1160
01:20:13,996 --> 01:20:17,124
Maddie, Maldy-- Maldy? Maldy.

1161
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:19,797
- Madrigal.
- Madrigal.

1162
01:20:20,036 --> 01:20:22,561
Madrigal Parmelee. Oh, she was hot!

1163
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:26,174
- She was a nasty little thing.
- Matthew!

1164
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:29,739
Sorry, Ma. I mean, she was
a fine upstanding young woman.

1165
01:20:34,617 --> 01:20:37,552
How about you, Troy?
Got yourself a little girlfriend?

1166
01:20:37,787 --> 01:20:40,255
- No.
- Why not?

1167
01:20:40,456 --> 01:20:43,448
I ain't got time.
Too much fishing and camping to do.

1168
01:20:43,693 --> 01:20:46,560
- Troy just got a new tent.
- What kind of tents you got?

1169
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:49,693
Army tent. Not them sissy ones
with all the colors.

1170
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:53,060
- Tell Matt about the other night.
- He was camping in the yard.

1171
01:20:53,302 --> 01:20:56,396
Oh, I made him come in.
I was worried.

1172
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,800
I went out and made him come inside.

1173
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:01,066
- Mama, that ain't what happened.
- Go on.

1174
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:04,438
- Go on. Tell him.
- Come on.

1175
01:21:06,382 --> 01:21:10,148
Me and my buddy Paul put up this tent,
cooked our own dinner.

1176
01:21:10,519 --> 01:21:14,888
We roasted potatoes in tin foil on
the fire and cooked us some weenies.

1177
01:21:15,124 --> 01:21:17,388
Then what? Go on.

1178
01:21:18,861 --> 01:21:21,830
- About midnight--
- No, about 9:00, I think. Yeah.

1179
01:21:22,064 --> 01:21:24,658
- We heard some kind of animal.
- What kind was that?

1180
01:21:25,134 --> 01:21:26,795
- It was big.
- Was it a bunny?

1181
01:21:27,036 --> 01:21:28,503
- Was it a possum?
- Shut up.

1182
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:31,537
- Was it a squirrel?
- Was it a mouse?

1183
01:21:31,974 --> 01:21:33,669
Shut up! It was big and nasty.

1184
01:21:33,909 --> 01:21:36,241
Hey, look me in the eye, little man.

1185
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:39,447
You go inside because Mama said so
or were you scared?

1186
01:21:39,682 --> 01:21:41,149
Now, tell the truth.

1187
01:21:45,021 --> 01:21:46,488
Look me in the eye.

1188
01:21:49,925 --> 01:21:50,823
We got him.

1189
01:21:56,999 --> 01:21:59,194
Some people are asking
about your funeral...

1190
01:21:59,435 --> 01:22:02,734
...and I get real angry and I say,
"He's not dead yet."

1191
01:22:58,561 --> 01:23:00,552
Sorry, folks, we gotta wrap this up.

1192
01:23:00,796 --> 01:23:04,061
A little early, isn't it?
Rules say they can stay till 6:45.

1193
01:23:07,236 --> 01:23:09,966
It's time for you folks
to be leaving now.

1194
01:23:32,161 --> 01:23:34,425
- Here you go, Poncelet.
- Thanks, man.

1195
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:37,062
My stuff's in these pillowcases.

1196
01:23:37,299 --> 01:23:41,235
Better if y'all took it home with you.
Don't want the prison sending it.

1197
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:44,701
Craig, divide up all the stuff
except my boots from Marion.

1198
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:47,738
I want to walk to my execution
in these here boots.

1199
01:23:48,377 --> 01:23:49,776
Up on your feet.

1200
01:23:50,012 --> 01:23:52,207
You all say your goodbyes now.

1201
01:24:11,066 --> 01:24:12,727
See you later, Matt.

1202
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,170
- Bye.
- No goodbyes, little man.

1203
01:24:22,178 --> 01:24:24,442
- No, ma'am.
- Can't she hug him?

1204
01:24:25,214 --> 01:24:27,614
I'm sorry, Sister. Security reasons.

1205
01:24:36,292 --> 01:24:39,420
Don't cry, Mama.
I don't want to see no crying.

1206
01:24:39,762 --> 01:24:41,696
I'm not saying goodbye now.

1207
01:24:42,832 --> 01:24:45,995
- I'll call you tonight.
- See you, Matt. Stay strong.

1208
01:24:47,536 --> 01:24:49,060
Don't cry. I'll call you later.

1209
01:24:50,873 --> 01:24:52,500
We love you, Mattie.

1210
01:25:00,816 --> 01:25:05,412
If I'd put my arms around my boy,
I'd never have let go.

1211
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:19,567
Is my mama all right?

1212
01:25:22,004 --> 01:25:23,631
She's fine, Matt.

1213
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,601
All right. Goodbye.

1214
01:25:33,549 --> 01:25:35,278
I never had shrimp before.

1215
01:25:36,018 --> 01:25:37,246
They're pretty good.

1216
01:25:41,123 --> 01:25:44,718
So, what did he say? What's the word
on the lie detector test?

1217
01:25:46,762 --> 01:25:49,287
Culp said your answers
showed stress...

1218
01:25:49,532 --> 01:25:52,990
- ...and the results were inconclusive.
- Man.

1219
01:25:54,169 --> 01:25:57,798
Was the dude sure?
Absolutely, positively sure.

1220
01:26:00,543 --> 01:26:03,842
I felt all right answering them
questions. I didn't feel no stress.

1221
01:26:05,848 --> 01:26:07,338
I can't believe I failed.

1222
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:11,019
Matt, you'd have to be a robot
or insane not to feel stress now.

1223
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:13,448
I can't believe it didn't
come out right.

1224
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:22,028
Let's talk about what happened.
Let's talk about that night.

1225
01:26:22,665 --> 01:26:24,326
I don't want to talk about that.

1226
01:26:56,465 --> 01:26:57,796
- Get out.
- You're pretty.

1227
01:26:58,033 --> 01:26:59,557
- Trespassing.
- What?

1228
01:26:59,802 --> 01:27:02,362
- You're trespassing.
- We'll leave.

1229
01:27:02,605 --> 01:27:05,369
- Let's go!
- You're under arrest. Step out.

1230
01:27:05,608 --> 01:27:07,075
We'll leave. We didn't know.

1231
01:27:07,276 --> 01:27:08,937
Get out of the car!

1232
01:27:09,745 --> 01:27:12,441
- Where are we going?
- There's a bar back here.

1233
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:15,707
- Our boss's in the bar.
- Can't let you go, you've been bad.

1234
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:18,647
- Our boss is gonna be pissed.
- Maybe he'll let you go.

1235
01:27:19,888 --> 01:27:22,220
Well. Here we are.

1236
01:27:22,558 --> 01:27:23,547
This is the bar.

1237
01:27:23,959 --> 01:27:25,984
- Can we get you a drink?
- Kneel down.

1238
01:27:27,029 --> 01:27:28,155
I'm pissed off!

1239
01:27:28,597 --> 01:27:30,929
I'm pissed at the kids
for being parked.

1240
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:33,031
At the parents coming to see me die.

1241
01:27:33,268 --> 01:27:35,395
At myself for letting
Vitello get them kids.

1242
01:27:35,638 --> 01:27:38,937
I got a thing or two to say
to the Percys and the Delacroixs.

1243
01:27:39,475 --> 01:27:41,306
You want your last words
to be words of hatred?

1244
01:27:41,543 --> 01:27:43,841
Clyde Percy wants
to inject me hisself!

1245
01:27:44,146 --> 01:27:46,842
Well, think of how angry he must be.

1246
01:27:47,082 --> 01:27:49,243
He's never gonna see
his daughter again.

1247
01:27:49,485 --> 01:27:52,579
He's never gonna hold her,
love her, laugh with her.

1248
01:27:52,821 --> 01:27:54,618
You have robbed these parents.

1249
01:27:54,857 --> 01:27:57,792
They have nothing in their lives
but sorrow, no joy.

1250
01:27:58,027 --> 01:27:59,358
That is what you gave them.

1251
01:28:04,533 --> 01:28:06,330
Why were you in the woods?

1252
01:28:06,568 --> 01:28:09,264
- I told you, I was stoned!
- Don't blame the drugs.

1253
01:28:09,505 --> 01:28:12,668
You were harassing couples
for months before this happened.

1254
01:28:15,144 --> 01:28:17,408
- What was it?
- What do you mean?

1255
01:28:18,113 --> 01:28:20,343
Did you look up to Vitello,
think he was cool?

1256
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:23,584
Did you want to impress him?

1257
01:28:25,888 --> 01:28:27,981
- I don't know.
- You could have walked away.

1258
01:28:28,557 --> 01:28:30,855
- He went psycho on me.
- Don't blame him!

1259
01:28:31,093 --> 01:28:34,688
You blame him, the government,
drugs, blacks, the Percys.

1260
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,763
You blame the kids for being there.
What about Matthew Poncelet?

1261
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:41,691
Where's he in this story? What,
is he just an innocent? A victim?

1262
01:28:50,245 --> 01:28:51,872
I ain't no victim.

1263
01:29:00,756 --> 01:29:01,723
Poncelet.

1264
01:29:06,695 --> 01:29:09,459
Federal Appeals Court turned you down.

1265
01:29:10,432 --> 01:29:11,729
I'm sorry.

1266
01:29:21,443 --> 01:29:23,411
Sister, please step into the corridor.

1267
01:29:25,214 --> 01:29:27,205
I'll be right outside.

1268
01:29:42,264 --> 01:29:45,256
I'm sorry, son.
I feel like I failed.

1269
01:29:45,501 --> 01:29:49,699
No, you didn't fail. I appreciate
everything you done for me.

1270
01:29:51,874 --> 01:29:53,239
What is she typing?

1271
01:29:53,475 --> 01:29:56,205
Forms for the witnesses to sign.

1272
01:29:57,412 --> 01:30:00,074
You didn't fail.
The justice system failed me.

1273
01:30:00,315 --> 01:30:01,680
It stinks. It stinks bad.

1274
01:30:01,917 --> 01:30:03,248
I'll head out there.

1275
01:30:15,564 --> 01:30:17,293
Oh, God, help me.

1276
01:30:17,533 --> 01:30:20,161
This is such a terrifying place, Lord.

1277
01:30:20,402 --> 01:30:23,599
So cold. So calculated, this murder.

1278
01:30:23,839 --> 01:30:25,864
Just don't let him fall apart, God.

1279
01:30:26,108 --> 01:30:30,568
Oh, help him stay strong. Help me,
Jesus, stay strong. Help us, Lord.

1280
01:30:31,814 --> 01:30:35,511
Help us stay strong. Help me.

1281
01:30:56,905 --> 01:30:58,839
They shaved the calf of my leg.

1282
01:31:02,211 --> 01:31:03,371
Why?

1283
01:31:04,046 --> 01:31:07,447
I guess they was worried
they won't find a vein in my arm.

1284
01:31:09,284 --> 01:31:10,251
What's that number?

1285
01:31:11,687 --> 01:31:13,052
I put it on at Marion.

1286
01:31:14,256 --> 01:31:17,316
In case somebody killed me,
they could identify my body.

1287
01:31:24,132 --> 01:31:25,656
Did it hurt when you got all those?

1288
01:31:27,669 --> 01:31:30,729
You seeing these tattoos,
you gonna think I'm a bad person.

1289
01:31:34,276 --> 01:31:37,109
You just have more color
on your body than I thought.

1290
01:31:45,187 --> 01:31:47,018
Tried to give me two shots.

1291
01:31:48,523 --> 01:31:51,083
- A sedative and an antihistamine.
- Antihistamine?

1292
01:31:55,597 --> 01:31:59,431
Guess if I had an allergic reaction
to the shot that knocks you out...

1293
01:31:59,668 --> 01:32:00,635
...it gets messy.

1294
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,267
Come on, I want to give you...

1295
01:32:11,613 --> 01:32:13,308
...my Bible.

1296
01:32:14,016 --> 01:32:15,574
I dated it myself.

1297
01:32:20,188 --> 01:32:21,655
Thanks, Matt.

1298
01:32:24,126 --> 01:32:26,060
Step back from the cell, Sister.

1299
01:32:29,531 --> 01:32:31,294
Time to call home.

1300
01:32:33,035 --> 01:32:34,366
Will you stay?

1301
01:32:35,737 --> 01:32:39,195
I'll stay. I'll just give you
some privacy.

1302
01:32:46,581 --> 01:32:47,707
Hey, man.

1303
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,581
What're you doing?

1304
01:32:50,819 --> 01:32:52,411
You know. What are you doing?

1305
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:56,817
The time's clicking away.

1306
01:32:57,059 --> 01:32:58,526
- Hi.
- Hey.

1307
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:01,354
- What you doing? Grabbing the phone?
- Yep.

1308
01:33:01,596 --> 01:33:05,032
- Gonna sleep in your tent tonight?
- Yeah, I am.

1309
01:33:05,634 --> 01:33:07,261
Mama, I'm waiting to talk to you.

1310
01:33:08,236 --> 01:33:10,704
Don't cry, Mom. Don't cry.

1311
01:33:11,773 --> 01:33:12,865
Don't cry.

1312
01:33:19,815 --> 01:33:23,080
That's not the way it was, Mama.
That's not the way it was.

1313
01:33:23,318 --> 01:33:24,546
I was...

1314
01:33:26,121 --> 01:33:27,588
I was small.

1315
01:33:36,631 --> 01:33:38,758
I can hear him. Let me talk to him.

1316
01:33:39,801 --> 01:33:43,293
Hey, Troy. You take care of Mama,
okay? All right, little man?

1317
01:33:43,538 --> 01:33:45,005
You take care of Mama.

1318
01:33:47,075 --> 01:33:49,475
Mom? Mom?

1319
01:33:51,613 --> 01:33:54,912
I love you, Mom. I love you, Mom.

1320
01:33:58,053 --> 01:33:59,520
I just let it flow.

1321
01:34:00,222 --> 01:34:02,247
Told my mama I loved her.

1322
01:34:02,724 --> 01:34:04,783
I talked to each of the boys.

1323
01:34:05,127 --> 01:34:06,924
I hate saying goodbye.

1324
01:34:08,263 --> 01:34:11,664
I just told them if I get a chance,
I'd call right before I go.

1325
01:34:14,503 --> 01:34:15,902
What, Matt?

1326
01:34:16,338 --> 01:34:17,566
What is it?

1327
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:22,139
My mama kept saying,
"It was that Vitello."

1328
01:34:22,377 --> 01:34:25,244
She always regrets
that I got involved with him.

1329
01:34:27,182 --> 01:34:30,083
I didn't want her thinking that.

1330
01:34:31,086 --> 01:34:32,610
It was something you said.

1331
01:34:32,854 --> 01:34:34,481
I could've walked away.

1332
01:34:36,091 --> 01:34:37,353
I didn't.

1333
01:34:42,431 --> 01:34:44,023
I was a victim.

1334
01:34:46,168 --> 01:34:47,897
I was a fucking chicken.

1335
01:34:48,804 --> 01:34:50,931
He was older and tough as hell.

1336
01:34:51,206 --> 01:34:52,366
I was just...

1337
01:34:53,508 --> 01:34:56,477
...boozing up, trying to be
as tough as him. I couldn't.

1338
01:34:57,712 --> 01:34:59,907
I didn't have the guts
to stand up to him.

1339
01:35:03,752 --> 01:35:05,947
I told my mama I was yellow.

1340
01:35:09,591 --> 01:35:11,559
She kept saying, "It wasn't you, Matt.

1341
01:35:11,793 --> 01:35:13,784
It wasn't you, Matt. It wasn't you."

1342
01:35:15,964 --> 01:35:18,125
Your mama loves you, Matt.

1343
01:35:20,435 --> 01:35:21,732
That boy?

1344
01:35:26,041 --> 01:35:27,235
Walter?

1345
01:35:27,676 --> 01:35:28,870
Yeah?

1346
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:35,116
What?

1347
01:35:37,986 --> 01:35:39,351
I killed him.

1348
01:35:46,495 --> 01:35:47,962
And Hope?

1349
01:35:48,196 --> 01:35:49,390
No, ma'am.

1350
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,462
Did you rape her?

1351
01:35:57,405 --> 01:35:58,736
Yes, ma'am.

1352
01:36:02,043 --> 01:36:05,308
Do you take responsibility
for both of their deaths?

1353
01:36:05,547 --> 01:36:06,912
Yes, ma'am.

1354
01:36:09,184 --> 01:36:12,915
When the lights dimmed last night
I kneeled and prayed for them kids.

1355
01:36:13,155 --> 01:36:14,850
I never done that before.

1356
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:17,485
Oh, Matt.

1357
01:36:19,928 --> 01:36:23,125
There are spaces of sorrow
only God can touch.

1358
01:36:23,498 --> 01:36:26,228
You did a terrible thing, Matt,
a terrible thing.

1359
01:36:27,202 --> 01:36:29,193
But you have a dignity now.

1360
01:36:29,437 --> 01:36:31,371
Nobody can take that from you.

1361
01:36:32,707 --> 01:36:35,039
You are a son of God,
Matthew Poncelet.

1362
01:36:48,023 --> 01:36:51,049
Nobody ever called me
no son of God before.

1363
01:36:51,593 --> 01:36:55,256
Called me a son of you-know-what
lots of times, never no son of God.

1364
01:36:56,164 --> 01:36:59,156
I just hope my death
can give them parents some relief.

1365
01:36:59,401 --> 01:37:01,232
Maybe the best thing you can give...

1366
01:37:01,469 --> 01:37:05,496
...to the Percys and the Delacroixs
is a wish for their peace.

1367
01:37:05,774 --> 01:37:08,242
You know I never had
no real love myself.

1368
01:37:09,945 --> 01:37:13,142
Never loved a woman
or anybody else myself much good.

1369
01:37:16,885 --> 01:37:19,718
Well, it figures I'd have
to die to find love.

1370
01:37:28,129 --> 01:37:29,824
Thank you for loving me.

1371
01:37:43,445 --> 01:37:45,709
Oh, the time. It's been flying.

1372
01:37:48,183 --> 01:37:49,650
I'm really cold.

1373
01:37:50,051 --> 01:37:53,111
Can he have a jacket or something?
He's cold.

1374
01:37:58,193 --> 01:38:01,094
What happened to that song
you were gonna play for me?

1375
01:38:01,329 --> 01:38:02,557
The hymn?

1376
01:38:03,965 --> 01:38:07,059
They have a rule you can't
have music in the prison.

1377
01:38:07,402 --> 01:38:09,461
Yeah, so they won't let me play it.

1378
01:38:10,739 --> 01:38:13,401
Well, you know the words.
You can sing it.

1379
01:38:13,808 --> 01:38:17,175
- I can't sing.
- That's okay. Come on.

1380
01:39:24,779 --> 01:39:26,110
Thank you.

1381
01:39:39,828 --> 01:39:42,524
I need you to step
into the corridor, Sister.

1382
01:41:10,285 --> 01:41:12,549
Give me my boots! I want my boots!

1383
01:41:12,787 --> 01:41:16,120
A grown man going to his death
in a diaper and slippers.

1384
01:41:16,357 --> 01:41:21,090
I'll be done with all of this!
No bars, no cells, no life in a cage!

1385
01:41:22,697 --> 01:41:23,664
Matt.

1386
01:41:23,898 --> 01:41:25,297
Sister Helen...

1387
01:41:25,967 --> 01:41:27,491
...I'm gonna die.

1388
01:41:28,837 --> 01:41:32,102
You know truth.
The truth has made you free.

1389
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:34,274
God knows the truth about me.

1390
01:41:34,576 --> 01:41:36,134
I'm going to a better place.

1391
01:41:36,377 --> 01:41:38,106
I'm not worried about nothing.

1392
01:41:38,346 --> 01:41:39,643
You all right?

1393
01:41:40,815 --> 01:41:43,477
Yes. I'm okay.

1394
01:41:43,718 --> 01:41:46,312
- Christ is here.
- I won't worry about anything.

1395
01:41:46,554 --> 01:41:47,578
Okay.

1396
01:41:48,389 --> 01:41:52,621
Look, I want the last thing
you see in this world...

1397
01:41:52,861 --> 01:41:54,522
...to be a face of love.

1398
01:41:56,297 --> 01:41:58,026
So you look at me...

1399
01:41:58,266 --> 01:42:00,200
...when they do this thing.

1400
01:42:01,002 --> 01:42:02,526
You look at me.

1401
01:42:03,505 --> 01:42:06,235
I'll be the face of love for you.

1402
01:42:06,841 --> 01:42:08,103
Yes, ma'am.

1403
01:42:12,614 --> 01:42:14,514
Time to go, Poncelet.

1404
01:42:20,321 --> 01:42:21,879
Can Sister Helen touch me?

1405
01:42:22,423 --> 01:42:23,822
Yes, she may.

1406
01:42:25,827 --> 01:42:27,658
Dead man walking!

1407
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:57,016
"Do not be afraid.

1408
01:42:58,026 --> 01:43:00,256
For I have ordained thee.

1409
01:43:00,495 --> 01:43:03,089
I have called thee by thy name.

1410
01:43:03,331 --> 01:43:04,958
Thou art mine.

1411
01:43:06,234 --> 01:43:08,566
Should thou pass through the sea...

1412
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:11,662
...I shall be with thee.

1413
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:15,208
Should thee walk through the fire...

1414
01:43:16,077 --> 01:43:19,444
- ...thou shall not be scorched."
- God have mercy on your soul...

1415
01:43:19,681 --> 01:43:22,275
...in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

1416
01:43:22,517 --> 01:43:24,542
That's as far as you go, Sister.

1417
01:43:29,757 --> 01:43:32,385
Will you check in on my mama
from time to time?

1418
01:43:32,627 --> 01:43:34,857
Yes, Matt. You have my word on that.

1419
01:45:32,814 --> 01:45:35,305
Do you have any last words, Poncelet?

1420
01:45:38,319 --> 01:45:39,877
Yes, sir, I do.

1421
01:45:45,827 --> 01:45:47,351
Mr. Delacroix...

1422
01:45:48,863 --> 01:45:52,230
...I don't want to leave this world
with any hate in my heart.

1423
01:45:53,601 --> 01:45:56,729
I ask your forgiveness
for what I done.

1424
01:45:58,339 --> 01:46:01,797
It was a terrible thing I done
in taking your son away from you.

1425
01:46:04,045 --> 01:46:05,342
How about us?

1426
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:07,104
Mr. and Mrs. Percy...

1427
01:46:07,348 --> 01:46:09,714
...I hope my death
gives you some relief.

1428
01:46:17,558 --> 01:46:19,492
I just want to say...

1429
01:46:20,394 --> 01:46:22,328
...I think killing is wrong...

1430
01:46:22,563 --> 01:46:23,723
...no matter who does it.

1431
01:46:23,965 --> 01:46:28,095
Whether it's me or y'all
or your government.

1432
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,754
I love you.

1433
01:46:55,363 --> 01:46:56,489
I love you.

1434
01:48:36,898 --> 01:48:39,731
No! No!

1435
01:48:40,902 --> 01:48:42,733
Get off of her!

1436
01:50:11,125 --> 01:50:12,922
I'm out of here!

1437
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:14,627
Come on, boy!

1438
01:51:20,027 --> 01:51:23,485
May the love of God and the peace
of our dear Lord Jesus Christ...

1439
01:51:23,731 --> 01:51:26,291
...bless us and console us...

1440
01:51:26,534 --> 01:51:29,560
...and gently wipe every tear
from our eyes. Amen.

1441
01:51:29,804 --> 01:51:31,203
May Almighty God bless you...

1442
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:34,203
...the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1443
01:51:34,975 --> 01:51:37,034
Go now in the peace
and love of Christ.

1444
01:51:37,278 --> 01:51:38,768
Thanks be to God.

1445
01:51:52,259 --> 01:51:54,523
Now, you're gonna be strong
for your mama.

1446
01:52:14,281 --> 01:52:15,805
Mr. Delacroix.

1447
01:52:17,318 --> 01:52:20,310
- Sister.
- It's good to see you.

1448
01:52:22,423 --> 01:52:24,254
I don't know why I'm here.

1449
01:52:24,859 --> 01:52:26,622
I got a lot of hate.

1450
01:52:27,428 --> 01:52:28,690
I don't have your faith.

1451
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:31,758
It's not faith.
I wish it were that easy.

1452
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:34,224
It's work.

1453
01:52:36,403 --> 01:52:37,665
Maybe...

1454
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:44,033
...we could help each other find
a way out of the hate.

1455
01:52:46,714 --> 01:52:48,045
I don't know.

1456
01:52:49,683 --> 01:52:51,275
I don't think so.

1457
01:52:55,189 --> 01:52:56,588
I should go.

1458
01:53:14,074 --> 01:53:15,234
Evening.

1459
01:53:15,476 --> 01:53:17,034
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1460
01:53:17,278 --> 01:53:18,245
Hi, ldella.

1461
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:19,707
Herbie!
