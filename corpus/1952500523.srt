1
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,218
<i>The sun is shining,
and I hope it's a good omen...</i>

2
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,694
<i>for peace in Northern Ireland.</i>

3
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,755
<i>Not only because of pressure
from Mr. Clinton...</i>

4
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,131
<i>pressure from
the south of Ireland...</i>

5
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:41,832
<i>pressure from the Roman Catholic
hierarchy who want peace at any price-</i>

6
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,833
<i>No surrender!</i>

7
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:50,272
<i>You cannot hold the process
to ransom any longer...</i>

8
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:53,317
<i>so end the violence,
and end it now.</i>

9
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:57,582
<i>- What about the IRA?
- They haven't gone away,you know.</i>

10
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:35,325
Let's go, Danny.

11
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,257
Is 14 years not long
enough for you?

12
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:53,305
Time to say bye-bye, Danny.

13
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:22,897
- Quite a turnout, isn't it?
- Aye.

14
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:24,441
Quiet, please.

15
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,785
One for the governor.

16
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,653
Thirty pounds.

17
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:47,061
Ticket for the boat.
Please sign.

18
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:58,240
- It's a wedding!
- Just throw the bouquet.

19
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:59,742
Go on.

20
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:12,480
- Jesus Christ. Danny Flynn.
- Come on! Move it!

21
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:14,491
- That's Danny Flynn?
- I think so.

22
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:18,395
There you go.

23
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:19,987
Thanks, Maggie.

24
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:25,531
That's lookin' great, Maggie.
Well done.

25
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:27,537
Liam looks well.

26
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,832
Why is your father comin'
to the reception, Maggie?

27
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,878
To keep an eye on you.

28
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,475
Sure. Why not?

29
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,279
- Let's get things organized for Joe.
- Right.

30
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,329
Come on.
Come inside.

31
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,801
Hurry up!
In the club.

32
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,650
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

33
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,165
Danny Flynn's out.

34
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:54,747
- Granddad!
- Liam.

35
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:58,459
Come here. Go on.

36
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:00,462
- Mr. Hamill.
- Sean.

37
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,499
- How are you,Jimmy?
- Not bad, Mr. Hamill.

38
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:10,334
- What about you?
- Fine.

39
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:12,533
- Hello, Mr. Hamill.
- What are you readin', Brian?

40
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:14,041
<i>Spider-man!</i>

41
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:18,541
- Keep movin'.
- Hello, Joe.

42
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:20,047
Hello, lads.

43
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:28,455
Hey, lads. I told you
my granddad was comin'.

44
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:31,860
How are you doin'?

45
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,022
- You look absolutely gorgeous.
- Thank you.

46
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,034
- Congratulations,Josephine.
- Thanks for comin'.

47
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:42,332
This is a wee something for ya.
Okay?

48
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:45,067
- Oh, thank you.
- Where's Maggie?

49
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:48,872
- She's through there, I think.
- I'll see youse later.

50
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:57,313
You did a great job, you.
The prisoners would be proud of ya.

51
00:05:57,386 --> 00:05:59,547
Oh, thanks for comin', Da.

52
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:03,023
- What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

53
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:06,757
Are you upset?

54
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,195
Oh, I was just thinking
about things, you know?

55
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:40,453
<i>Let me down easy</i>

56
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:44,360
<i>Putting my heart on the edge</i>

57
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:50,630
Can I have a word
with you outside, please?

58
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:54,642
- What's the problem?
- There is no problem. Let's go.

59
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,769
- What's happenin'?
- I was only dancin' with him.

60
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:58,973
You're a prisoner's wife,
for God's sake!

61
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:01,812
Oh,Jesus! He was only
dancin' with the girl.

62
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:03,317
It's all right. Relax.

63
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:05,320
He didn't know she was
a prisoner's wife.

64
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:06,753
It's all right.

65
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:11,490
Her husband's stayin'
five years in prison.

66
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,393
If you go near his wife again,
understand...

67
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:17,660
I'll shoot both your kneecaps off.

68
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,166
Sorry.

69
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:27,340
It's all right.
It's all right.

70
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,901
Don't be worryin', Agnes.
The trouble's sorted out.

71
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,607
- What's goin' on?
- Nothin', Ma.

72
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:46,520
<i>We can't get no</i>

73
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:50,656
<i>Man reaction, but we try</i>

74
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:55,761
<i>And we try, and we try
and we try</i>

75
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,382
I wanted to tell ya
how proud we all are of ya.

76
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,018
How you stood by your man.

77
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:20,722
I know that when I was inside,
it was easy to do my time...

78
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:23,697
because I had
a strong woman behind me.

79
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:27,725
My wife Eileen,
God rest her soul...

80
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:32,001
stood by me and remained
faithful to the cause.

81
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:37,671
And now my daughter,
with her brave son, Liam...

82
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:41,911
keeps her house together until
her husband, Thomas, returns.

83
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:44,976
On one day, and that day may be
sooner than you think-

84
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:46,487
He's gonna sell us out.

85
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:50,787
all the prisoners will come home.

86
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:56,565
And the Brits will be gone...

87
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:01,626
and we will have peace in Ireland.

88
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:03,867
And you-

89
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:07,773
you women who stood by your men...

90
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:11,973
will be remembered
as the bravest of the district.

91
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:16,006
So I want youse
to lift your glasses...

92
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:18,451
to our prisoners' wives.

93
00:09:18,521 --> 00:09:20,819
- The wives.
- The wives.

94
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:26,326
Come on in, lads. Come on.

95
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,103
Twopence.

96
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:47,077
Hey, boy.

97
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:54,253
Hey, Flynn.

98
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,652
Danny Flynn.

99
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:01,218
Do you not know me?

100
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:06,234
Ike? Ike Weir?

101
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:08,736
Ah, ashamed of me, are ya?

102
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:13,434
- Pretending not to see me.
- It's good to see you, Ike.

103
00:10:15,544 --> 00:10:19,173
- What are you doin' here?
- I needed a bed for the night.

104
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:22,081
Oh, the bad boys
didn't take care of ya?

105
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,944
Bad boyos didn't give you
a party, huh?

106
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:29,787
The big IRA boyos
didn't give him a party.

107
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:36,194
- Where's all your big men now?
- Take it easy, Ike.

108
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:41,635
Take it easy?
Don't you tell me to take it easy!

109
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:46,674
How come you don't blow yourself
up like the rest of the IRA?

110
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:51,076
- Tell 'em Ike Weir's afraid of nobody.
- Sit down, Ike.

111
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:53,842
Don't you tell me to sit down!

112
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,817
You tell 'em Ike Weir
doesn't need a gun to fight!

113
00:10:56,886 --> 00:11:01,949
- Ike, for God's sake!
- IRA? Fuck your IRA!

114
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:06,552
Put your gun down, Danny Flynn!
Fight me like a man!

115
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:10,725
Didn't I rear ya?
I coached him!

116
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,199
I trained him
when he was a child.

117
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,073
Destroyed his life.

118
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,381
Best fighter in Ulster.

119
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:42,130
Ah, he's gone.
Fell asleep.

120
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:46,865
Lights out.
Lights out in ten minutes.

121
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,636
How's the head, Ike?

122
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:39,644
Danny Flynn.
Jesus Christ, it is you.

123
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,397
- Got the price of a cup of tea?
- Aye, come on.

124
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:15,882
The semtex is loaded.
We're all set.

125
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:33,269
You've got 45 minutes.
Good luck.

126
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,367
We met last night, you know.

127
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:12,904
You had a wee go at me.
Told me a bit of truth.

128
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:21,282
Well, to tell you
the truth now, Danny...

129
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:25,554
I don't want any breakfast.

130
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:28,529
I just want a few shillings
for some wine.

131
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:32,299
Can you help me?

132
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,415
I look bad, don't I?

133
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:53,988
Why didn't you stick with the gym?

134
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:58,552
After you were arrested...

135
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:02,597
the Protestant lads didn't show up.

136
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,657
They took it hard.

137
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,727
They were very surprised.

138
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,301
That was it for me.

139
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:18,336
They use it
as a community center now.

140
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:30,591
He's clear.

141
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:45,606
There ya are, love.

142
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:53,380
- So how's your ma?
- She's all right.

143
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:56,282
So what are you gonna do?

144
00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:00,417
Thought I'd try and get
a few fights in England.

145
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,354
Professional?

146
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:04,517
Aye.
Just a few fights.

147
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:08,524
- How old are you?
- Thirty-two.

148
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,967
Archie Moore fought
for the world title at 42.

149
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,903
Why, Danny?

150
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,888
I just want to set
the record straight.

151
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:40,955
Jesus Christ!

152
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:46,059
It's across the river.

153
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:49,564
Another fuckin' bomb.

154
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,708
Get the boat, Danny.

155
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,684
Get the boat.

156
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:23,263
- What do you think you're doing?
- This is my home.

157
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:44,718
- Is that his old house?
- Aye.

158
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:04,370
How's it goin', scrapper?

159
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:09,442
How's the head?

160
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:16,973
- Fine.
- You're out.

161
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,057
- Good behavior.
- You were never accused of that before.

162
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:31,632
- You missed the boat, scrapper.
- I'd no watch.

163
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:38,572
- You know Joe wanted you out of town.
- This is my home.

164
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,234
- You're gonna live here?
- Aye.

165
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,137
You're a strange man, Danny.

166
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:51,375
All you had to do was walk
across a prison corridor...

167
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:55,355
and shake hands with some of
your old friends in the IRA.

168
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:58,421
Snubbin' people is not nice.

169
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:04,792
But you never named names, and that's
why you're a healthy man. Understand?

170
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,036
What are you lookin' at?

171
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,370
It's not my fault you got caught.

172
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,376
You should have run away.

173
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,815
- Why is he back?
- I don't know.

174
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:28,822
- Why the fuck should I know?
- Is it Maggie?

175
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:33,826
No, he wouldn't have
the balls for that.

176
00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:35,829
So you say.

177
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,295
No, he knows he'd get
a fuckin' bullet in the head.

178
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:48,737
- Say bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

179
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:02,186
Just wait a wee minute there.
I'll see if the community center's open.

180
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:10,391
Okay. Come on in.

181
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:12,433
Come on, come on.
Are you gonna deal or what?

182
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,866
Ah, take time.
Take your time.

183
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:28,040
Young Flynn, isn't it?

184
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,327
What happened to the ring?

185
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:53,567
That packed out years ago.

186
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:56,576
I think it's stuck
under thon stage there.

187
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:13,954
There's a man standing there.

188
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:24,362
There's been an approach...

189
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,534
to the community center.

190
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,842
Danny Flynn wants to set up
a gym there.

191
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:36,409
What do you think?

192
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:42,514
- Boxin'?
- Boxin'.

193
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:23,891
You're in good shape.

194
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:47,520
It's been a few years since
this stuff's seen the light of day.

195
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:06,164
Did you see this, Ike?

196
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,940
You 20 years ago.
Your face wasn't so red.

197
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:17,645
- Aye, he was a tough man, Ike.
- Ah, there's young Joey Fitzsimons.

198
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:20,017
And young McCormack.
He's dead too.

199
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,171
Show us your jab. Hey!

200
00:25:00,828 --> 00:25:04,355
- Ma, I'm goin' to Ned's.
- Well, don't be late.

201
00:25:04,432 --> 00:25:06,866
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

202
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,915
Congratulations, Peter.

203
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:27,086
Harry.

204
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:50,541
Peter Mallon's been elected
to the army council.

205
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:57,308
I've decided I need
somebody more political.

206
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,282
All operations are to be
suspended from 12:00 tomorrow.

207
00:26:05,827 --> 00:26:07,920
- Noon.
- Noon.

208
00:26:07,995 --> 00:26:09,929
Tomorrow.

209
00:26:09,997 --> 00:26:12,966
- Tomorrow.
- Why?

210
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:19,170
- We're close to a deal, Harry.
- Including the POWs?

211
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,504
Including the POWs.

212
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:25,168
So what are you offerin', Joe?

213
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:31,919
Peace, Harry. Peace.

214
00:26:33,187 --> 00:26:36,958
Peace. I'm sure
you can deliver, Joe.

215
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:49,936
Left hand up.

216
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:56,267
That's it, man.

217
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:59,177
Keep your legs moving.

218
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:02,443
- Your father's a boxer too, isn't he?
- Aye.

219
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:05,917
Get your balance right.
Move your head.

220
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:09,582
Lift those punches.

221
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:11,955
That's it.
And again. And again.

222
00:27:13,027 --> 00:27:14,289
That's it.

223
00:27:16,764 --> 00:27:19,198
That's it! Good man.

224
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,180
I see you've put up the ring.

225
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:36,682
- Aye.
- Looks great.

226
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,820
Well, sweetheart...

227
00:27:54,635 --> 00:27:58,264
did you die just so Joe Hamill
could sell us out?

228
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:02,774
Nothin'.

229
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:06,776
Just talkin' to myself.

230
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:16,689
12:00 noon.
Peace in Ireland.

231
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,391
Ma, it's the cease-fire!

232
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:30,164
<i>A scene of celebration
on the streets of West Belfast...</i>

233
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:33,434
<i>as 12:00 noon brought
the long-awaited IRA cease-fire.</i>

234
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:35,998
<i>Protestant spokespersons, however...</i>

235
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:38,602
<i>opposed any immediate movement
on the release of prisoners.</i>

236
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,884
You get to know who the troublemakers
are quick enough.

237
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:48,012
Just keep an eye on the tables.

238
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:50,182
No one comes into
the city center after dark...

239
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:53,852
so you only have to work
till 6:00 or so.

240
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:56,123
- You ever been in London?
- Aye.

241
00:28:57,331 --> 00:29:00,323
I got a few contacts there.
Come on.

242
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:11,110
Ike, where's Danny?

243
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:13,112
He's in the kitchen.

244
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,908
What's goin' on, Danny?

245
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,912
What do you mean?

246
00:29:51,585 --> 00:29:55,419
I haven't seen you in 14 years...

247
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:59,016
and now you're right
next door to me every day.

248
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:04,429
And when I do see you, all I get
from you is the odd grunt.

249
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,432
Do you not think that's strange?

250
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:19,675
- Aye, it is strange.
- Oh, forget it, Danny.

251
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:30,817
Come on. Pick it up.

252
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:37,325
That's it. Good man.

253
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,267
And again.
Move him about.

254
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:47,234
Beautiful. And again.
Get the punches in.

255
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:51,768
That's it. And again.
Keep your guard up, Danny!

256
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:55,280
Danny, come on in.
Look at these.

257
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,915
Look.

258
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:03,422
There's Maclean.

259
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:16,002
"Holy Family
Sweep the All Irelands."

260
00:31:20,374 --> 00:31:23,366
What a waste of life.

261
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:28,074
Six of them dead. Why the hell
did you get mixed up with them?

262
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:34,853
The police were burning people
out of their homes, Ike.

263
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:36,856
Soldiers shootin' people
on the corner.

264
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:39,222
Why the hell do you
think I got involved?

265
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:42,728
I don't know.

266
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:44,730
What's in the cupboard?

267
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:56,338
- Ah, it's locked.
- We're lockin' up, lads.

268
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,073
There's only odds and ends in there
belongin' to the community center.

269
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:25,033
Fuckin' semtex.

270
00:33:23,997 --> 00:33:25,430
These are explosives, Birdy.

271
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:27,899
Why the fuck didn't you tell me
he was rootin' around in here?

272
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:30,402
Kept an eye on him.

273
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:43,072
The lock's broken.

274
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:49,249
It's gone!

275
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,169
Can I have a word with you?

276
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:21,986
You're in trouble.
What did you do?

277
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:29,626
I found some stuff.
Semtex.

278
00:34:30,897 --> 00:34:33,798
Under the stage?

279
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:35,300
Bastards.

280
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:40,902
- Well, where is it now?
- In the river.

281
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:45,210
Well, why didn't you give it
back to my father?

282
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,674
So they can kill more
innocent people?

283
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:51,684
What do you mean, innocent people?

284
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:54,319
I mean innocent people, Maggie.

285
00:34:57,624 --> 00:34:59,819
Do you want to get
yourself killed, Danny?

286
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:02,722
Not particularly.

287
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:07,930
- Why did you really come back?
- What do you mean?

288
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:14,369
I don't believe you just
came back here to box.

289
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,268
If you ask me to leave, I'll go.

290
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:20,779
If I ask you to leave.

291
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,111
Well, how far can you go,
Danny?

292
00:35:27,187 --> 00:35:31,487
Turn around, start walking,
and when you've walked for 14 years...

293
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:34,584
then stop and think
about what you did to me.

294
00:35:36,463 --> 00:35:37,896
I did it for ya.

295
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,434
Oh, my God.

296
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:53,874
I'm sorry.

297
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:56,381
<i>The next train
from platform one...</i>

298
00:35:56,449 --> 00:36:00,283
<i>will be the 10:50 service
to Londonderry-</i>

299
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:08,656
I think we're safe enough here.

300
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:11,128
Ah, we're fine.
Don't worry about us.

301
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:13,131
Thank you.

302
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:29,974
You used to talk to me, Danny.

303
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:37,485
You used to make me laugh.
Oh, go on, make me laugh.

304
00:36:40,193 --> 00:36:42,423
Am I not funny?

305
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:55,332
Talk to me, Danny.

306
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:04,445
I talk to you in my mind.

307
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,153
What do you mean?

308
00:37:16,062 --> 00:37:18,963
In prison, you get used
to silence, you know?

309
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:29,207
I mean, at first, you hold on
to all the old voices in your head-

310
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,546
kids you knew at school,
old friends and such.

311
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:39,210
Well, after a while,
those voices start to fade...

312
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:44,746
and you end up talkin' to yourself
for a bit of company, you know?

313
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:50,561
And then something
strange happens.

314
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,164
It's as if even your own
voice doesn't belong there...

315
00:37:58,238 --> 00:38:00,638
in the silence.

316
00:38:00,707 --> 00:38:02,140
It's unwelcome.

317
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,077
Go on, Danny.

318
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:15,286
Well, in the end it's the silence
becomes your best friend.

319
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:23,462
And in the quiet,
a face will come to you, and...

320
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:31,460
and you talk to that person
without sayin' anything, and-

321
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:39,177
Gee, I'm not makin' any sense.

322
00:38:39,245 --> 00:38:41,475
Never make any fuckin' sense.

323
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:45,581
What are you sayin', Danny?

324
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:53,414
I've lived with your face
in silence for 14 years, Maggie.

325
00:38:53,493 --> 00:38:56,985
And now it's hard
to talk to the real you.

326
00:38:59,265 --> 00:39:01,358
I'm not who I was.

327
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:09,899
Try the elbow.
Set down on the way. That's it.

328
00:39:09,976 --> 00:39:12,774
Once more. That's it.
Snap on your jab.

329
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:15,405
That's it. One more.

330
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:17,972
Come on. One-two!
And again.

331
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:20,679
- And again.
- He wants to join.

332
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,785
- He's the boss.
- One-two.

333
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:31,291
- Shadowbox.
- He wants to join.

334
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:33,798
Use the rest of the ring, now.

335
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,903
Come here.

336
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:48,580
- No way, missus.
- Who are you to talk, Ike Weir?

337
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:55,244
Make him have a blood test.

338
00:39:55,321 --> 00:40:00,020
If he's clear and he stays off
the junk, he can join.

339
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:03,825
Keep your head movin' now.

340
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:05,830
That's it.
Duck and weave.

341
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:07,832
Bob and weave.

342
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:16,667
Well done. Good jab.
Keep on the move. That's it.

343
00:40:16,743 --> 00:40:21,009
Come on. Hold on. Thumbs out.
That's it. Elbows in. Nice and tight.

344
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,207
Good. Very good.

345
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:28,753
Look at these.

346
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:33,655
Headgear's gone.
You can't spar with these.

347
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:36,694
Look at that.

348
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:47,103
- What does that mean, Bootsy?
- What?

349
00:40:48,006 --> 00:40:49,997
"Nonsectarian."

350
00:40:52,044 --> 00:40:53,739
Catholics and Protestants together.

351
00:40:57,216 --> 00:41:00,208
What about the Jews, Bootsy?
And the Arabs?

352
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,952
And the Muslims?

353
00:41:04,022 --> 00:41:05,853
I suppose they can come,
too, if they want.

354
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:21,028
Liam, move in!

355
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:25,309
Come on!

356
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:31,814
Holy Family's
always been nonsectarian.

357
00:41:31,884 --> 00:41:34,216
Protestants and Catholics together.

358
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:36,879
Write that down!

359
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:47,889
And the winner is...

360
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,094
<i>in the red corner...</i>

361
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:53,933
<i>Doyle from the Holy Family Club...</i>

362
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:55,439
<i>Belfast.</i>

363
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:59,305
I won!

364
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:01,312
You fought a great fight.

365
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:05,649
Okay, Danny. Let's go.

366
00:42:05,717 --> 00:42:07,742
Don't forget.
It's your first fight in a long time.

367
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:10,083
You're gonna learn a lot.

368
00:42:20,198 --> 00:42:23,656
Ladies and gentleman, can I have
your attention, please?

369
00:42:23,735 --> 00:42:25,498
I want to say somethin' tonight.

370
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:30,536
Of the many people that
gave their lives in the Troubles...

371
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:32,975
this night is dedicated
to the members...

372
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:37,209
of the Holy Family Boxing Club
who've died.

373
00:42:37,282 --> 00:42:40,308
Now, all these boys' parents
are in the hall tonight...

374
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:45,846
so I'd like youse all
to observe a minute's silence.

00:42:50,896 --> 00:42:53,797

388
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:44,475
Sammy's parents are Protestants

389
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:46,847
and this is their first night
in the club...

390
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:51,218
since the Troubles began
28 years ago.

391
00:43:52,357 --> 00:43:56,885
And I'd like you all
to welcome them back.

392
00:44:07,372 --> 00:44:10,432
- Did you know that was gonna happen?
- No.

393
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:12,033
Sentimental shite.

394
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:20,143
Balance now.
Keep your balance now.

395
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:25,618
Come on, Danny!

396
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:28,723
- Come on!
- Use your jab. Use the jab!

397
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:30,728
- Try hittin' him, Danny!
- Shut up!

398
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:39,998
- Come on, lads! Box!
- Danny's way off.

399
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:42,836
Move in, Danny!

400
00:44:48,547 --> 00:44:50,981
I'm gonna fuckin' kill ya!

401
00:45:02,427 --> 00:45:06,261
He's showboatin' ya! Don't let him
do that! He's playin' around with ya!

402
00:45:10,535 --> 00:45:12,594
Hit him! Come on!

403
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:16,305
Flynn should get
the Nobel Peace Prize for boxin'.

404
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:24,008
Stay off the ropes!

405
00:45:25,584 --> 00:45:28,485
That a boy, Danny!
Go on!

406
00:45:32,457 --> 00:45:37,520
- Jesus Christ, Danny!
- One, two, three...

407
00:45:37,596 --> 00:45:40,656
- four, five, six...
- If he gets up, I'll fuckin' kill him.

408
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:43,530
- Come on! Get up!
- seven, eight-

409
00:45:43,602 --> 00:45:45,035
Box!

410
00:45:50,108 --> 00:45:51,700
Break! Break!

411
00:45:55,447 --> 00:45:57,813
You're not ready.

412
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:01,914
- Have you had enough, son?
- I'll tell you when I've had enough.

413
00:46:01,987 --> 00:46:03,420
Finish him.

414
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:14,057
Get him down, Danny!

415
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:21,167
Go on, Danny!

416
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:30,941
Go on, Danny!

417
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:36,386
- Are you okay? Can you continue?
- Aye.

418
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:48,866
He can't put him down!
He fuckin' won't bow down!

419
00:46:51,303 --> 00:46:53,635
Hold him, Danny!

420
00:46:53,705 --> 00:46:55,536
Come on, Danny!
Come on!

421
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:57,234
Stay on your feet, lad!

422
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,544
Don't go down!
Stay on your feet, Danny!

423
00:47:06,384 --> 00:47:08,181
Twenty seconds!

424
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:10,380
Stay on your feet, Danny!

425
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:31,538
- He doesn't look like a quitter to me.
- Danny! Danny! Danny!

426
00:48:00,472 --> 00:48:02,497
What was that about, scrapper?

427
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:06,009
What do you mean?

428
00:48:06,077 --> 00:48:08,443
Those were powerful emotions
you stirred up tonight.

429
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:13,181
What are you up to?

430
00:48:13,251 --> 00:48:15,087
I was just boxin'.

431
00:48:16,388 --> 00:48:19,619
It's not just boxin', Danny.
It's a fuckin' statement-

432
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,784
standin' there
gettin' your head knocked off.

433
00:48:24,763 --> 00:48:26,628
What was that about?

434
00:48:32,104 --> 00:48:33,731
I want the stuff back, scrapper.

435
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:38,471
What stuff?

436
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,745
All right, Danny.
Play it whatever way you want.

437
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:50,282
Fourteen years wasn't enough
to teach you then. Was it, lad?

438
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:55,182
- What'd he want?
- Nothin', Ike.

439
00:48:57,295 --> 00:48:58,728
Good.

440
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:03,328
He ruined your life once already.

441
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:06,097
- Don't give him a second chance.
- I won't.

442
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:13,710
You should have put him away
the first time.

443
00:49:13,778 --> 00:49:18,340
You did him a favor.
He'll never forgive you for it.

444
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:21,947
I D, please.

445
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:24,354
I D?

446
00:49:27,492 --> 00:49:28,925
Thank you.

447
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:44,299
I'm not too sure about this,
Maggie.

448
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:47,072
Well, it's safer than being
seen together in West Belfast.

449
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:56,579
Why didn't you ask me to wait?

450
00:49:59,357 --> 00:50:02,417
- I would have waited.
- Don't say that. Fourteen years.

451
00:50:02,494 --> 00:50:05,520
- I would have waited.
- You were only 16.

452
00:50:05,597 --> 00:50:08,157
- Did you not trust me?
- How the hell could I trust ya?

453
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:11,168
I was mad in love with ya.

454
00:50:12,103 --> 00:50:14,765
And I wanted to keep it that way.

455
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:17,808
Not have it eaten up day by day.

456
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,942
So you made the decision
for both of us?

457
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,944
- You made your own decisions too.
- What do you mean?

458
00:50:25,016 --> 00:50:27,644
You married my best friend,
for God's sake.

459
00:50:29,287 --> 00:50:31,346
Well, did you expect me
to remain faithful to you?

460
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:37,652
I suppose I did.
I thought I was bein' romantic.

461
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:39,959
Givin' you your freedom
or somethin'.

462
00:50:40,732 --> 00:50:44,634
You were giving me my freedom, but
you wanted me to stay faithful to you?

463
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,433
I was only 19.

464
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:52,839
- Shake my hand.
- What?

465
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:56,108
Shake my hand, Danny Boy Flynn.
Billy Patterson, bantamweight.

466
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,775
- Jesus, Billy! How are you doin'?
- Good, good.

467
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,375
I'm doin' fine. Don't look now.

468
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:03,387
But there's a car behind ya...

469
00:51:03,455 --> 00:51:07,721
and the last Catholic boy who was
in that car didn't die a happy death.

470
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:09,692
So I'll walk youse
to the peace line together.

471
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:11,194
Let's go.

472
00:51:20,405 --> 00:51:22,965
Bye-bye, Maggie.
Good luck, Danny.

473
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,668
Stop by and do a bit
of training sometime.

474
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:26,176
Will do.

475
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:45,496
- What's wrong?
- I don't take gear from cops.

476
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:48,555
- Why?
- They won't let my dad out of prison.

477
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:51,158
- Yeah, go on!
- Looks great, Reggie.

478
00:51:57,609 --> 00:51:59,543
What about you, Liam?

479
00:52:18,997 --> 00:52:21,022
Come on, lads.
Come on. Photograph time.

480
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:25,399
- What's all this?
- It's a gift.

481
00:52:26,905 --> 00:52:31,205
- A gift from who?
- Community relations.

482
00:52:33,478 --> 00:52:35,412
- All right.
- Come here.

483
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:39,139
Group together like that.

484
00:52:45,223 --> 00:52:49,057
- Community relations?
- Aye. Reggie Bell.

485
00:52:50,195 --> 00:52:51,822
This stuff is from the cops...

486
00:52:52,697 --> 00:52:54,790
and we can't accept it.

487
00:52:56,534 --> 00:53:00,561
Listen, these kids have
barely got shoes on their feet.

488
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:03,402
Some of them
come here in rags.

489
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:06,069
Look at them now.
They look great.

490
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:09,636
I don't give a fuckin' shite who these
togs come from. They're on their backs.

491
00:53:09,714 --> 00:53:12,342
- All right.
- They're not comin' off.

492
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:16,683
<i>We simply can't negotiate until
the terrorists lay down their arms.</i>

493
00:53:16,755 --> 00:53:21,783
<i>The police are Protestant.
They're not welcome in Catholic areas.</i>

494
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:26,092
<i>In contrast, it seems the whole
of Belfast, Catholic and Protestant...</i>

495
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:30,692
<i>is welcome at the recently reopened,
nonsectarian Holy Family Boxing Club.</i>

496
00:53:30,769 --> 00:53:32,498
Takin' gear from the cops.

497
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,504
<i>The boys from the club
recently received...</i>

498
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,540
<i>a generous donation
of equipment.</i>

499
00:53:36,608 --> 00:53:39,076
<i>And Danny Flynn,
who fights out of Holy Family...</i>

500
00:53:39,144 --> 00:53:43,103
<i>has signed up for a rematch
with Eddie Carroll at the city center.</i>

501
00:54:36,434 --> 00:54:39,062
Get them!
Get those sons of bitches!

502
00:54:48,613 --> 00:54:51,548
Who fired at Danny Flynn
last night, Harry?

503
00:54:51,616 --> 00:54:54,016
I don't know.
My units shoot to kill.

504
00:54:54,886 --> 00:55:00,153
- You're in charge of the district.
- No. I report to you.

505
00:55:00,225 --> 00:55:02,090
Did you see this?

506
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:07,163
He's fillin' people's heads
full of shit, Joe.

507
00:55:07,232 --> 00:55:10,065
"Leave the fighting to Danny" means
that all the people who are in prison...

508
00:55:10,134 --> 00:55:12,830
who died, who didn't
surrender to the Brits-

509
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:17,136
that means that their sacrifices aren't
worth a lousy fuckin' boxin' match.

510
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:20,177
He's spreadin' dissent, Joe.

511
00:55:20,245 --> 00:55:23,646
Maybe you're the one who's
spreadin' dissent, Harry.

512
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:32,287
I'm trying to hold together a district
of junkies, thieves and losers...

513
00:55:32,357 --> 00:55:34,825
while all he's trying to say is
that everything will be all right...

514
00:55:34,893 --> 00:55:39,626
if the Catholics and Protestants
will hold hands together.

515
00:55:39,697 --> 00:55:42,564
It's shit, isn't it, Joe?

516
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:46,132
Is it, Harry?

517
00:55:46,204 --> 00:55:47,501
Shit?

518
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:50,598
You know we're gonna have
to live with them sometime.

519
00:55:50,675 --> 00:55:54,668
- Who's "them"?
- The Protestants, Harry.

520
00:55:54,746 --> 00:55:56,270
The other half of the population.

521
00:56:01,152 --> 00:56:05,521
You're never going to be
treated as an equal, Joe.

522
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:08,525
Not if we keep bombin' 'em, no.

523
00:56:08,593 --> 00:56:11,187
I don't see any POWs
comin' home, Joe.

524
00:56:11,262 --> 00:56:15,756
Well, last night
didn't help, Harry.

525
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:18,735
It didn't help at all.

526
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:22,331
Keep it goin', Bootsy.
Keep it goin'.

527
00:56:22,405 --> 00:56:23,804
And again.

528
00:56:23,873 --> 00:56:26,603
- Throw the combinations, Danny!
- And again.

529
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,769
Let's go. And again.

530
00:56:29,912 --> 00:56:32,881
- One-two!
- Use the jab!

531
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:34,280
- Watch it!
- Danny.

532
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,284
Come on! Again!

533
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,591
That was a warning shot
they fired at you.

534
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:45,718
- I'll see you later.
- Aye.

535
00:57:04,413 --> 00:57:07,177
You know, we can't keep doin'
what we're doin', Maggie.

536
00:57:10,653 --> 00:57:12,587
What are we doing?

537
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,892
You know what I'm sayin'.
Come on.

538
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:23,464
You're right.

539
00:57:35,011 --> 00:57:36,945
Give us a hug.

540
00:57:44,654 --> 00:57:47,088
You're a dangerous fuckin' woman.

541
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:19,118
You talked about voices in your head.
I couldn't stop them.

542
00:58:19,188 --> 00:58:22,919
I thought my head would burst.

543
00:58:22,992 --> 00:58:25,426
And the only thing
that kept me sane-

544
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,697
- Ah, it doesn't matter now.
- Go on. I'm listening.

545
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:33,701
- It's not fair.
- Just finish it up, Maggie.

546
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:37,898
It was the sound
of your voice saying...

547
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:42,444
"Everything's gonna be all right."

548
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:46,543
Jeez, I never said that.

549
00:58:47,617 --> 00:58:52,111
Over and over again in my head.

550
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:54,622
"Everything is gonna be all right."

551
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:16,536
Well, this is okay.
This is all right.

552
00:59:17,947 --> 00:59:22,077
What? What is this?

553
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,282
This is us.
We don't got a name on it.

554
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:58,987
- Who is it?
- It's Danny. Can I come in?

555
01:00:02,024 --> 01:00:03,958
It's very late, Danny.

556
01:00:05,027 --> 01:00:07,427
You shouldn't be here.
It's not safe.

557
01:00:07,496 --> 01:00:08,428
I know.

558
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:17,472
This is fuckin' ridiculous,
you know?

559
01:00:27,783 --> 01:00:29,717
All this talk, Maggie,
you know?

560
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:32,687
We're kiddin' ourselves.

561
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:34,749
I love you.

562
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:38,189
There's nothin' else to say.

563
01:00:40,563 --> 01:00:42,554
We're not kids anymore, Danny.

564
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:44,599
Yeah, we are.

565
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:50,336
You're so fuckin' beautiful.

566
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:56,275
For 14 years I was locked up.

567
01:00:56,345 --> 01:00:59,576
Well, my feelings were
locked up inside of me.

568
01:01:05,588 --> 01:01:09,718
When I got in the ring again, you can't
imagine the relief it was to feel pain-

569
01:01:10,893 --> 01:01:13,657
to be back
in the world again.

570
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,722
I can give you up in my head,
but my body's cryin' out for you.

571
01:01:20,169 --> 01:01:21,602
Don't.

572
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:33,606
Be with me.

573
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,379
Be with me.

574
01:01:42,525 --> 01:01:44,459
I'm going mad, Danny.

575
01:01:46,362 --> 01:01:49,024
I have a scream inside of me
day and night.

576
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,361
Liam's upstairs.

577
01:01:58,374 --> 01:01:59,966
Have I said too much?

578
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:10,085
But...

579
01:02:11,754 --> 01:02:14,587
I think you've said
enough for now.

580
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,240
- I think you'd better go.
- Okay.

581
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,059
Is my da comin' home or not?

582
01:02:45,135 --> 01:02:47,968
Don't build up
your hopes, Liam.

583
01:02:48,038 --> 01:02:50,233
You said the prisoners
were comin' home.

584
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,446
What's wrong?

585
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:08,881
We're this close to a deal...

586
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:11,894
but I'm gettin' no concessions
on the prisoners.

587
01:03:13,297 --> 01:03:16,460
It's as though the Brits
want the cease-fire to fail.

588
01:03:18,268 --> 01:03:21,260
Harry says the only thing
they respond to is violence.

589
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:33,883
- It's a sellout.
- Go on, Belfast!

590
01:03:33,951 --> 01:03:37,045
Belfast is comin'
back to life.

591
01:03:37,121 --> 01:03:40,820
People see this man, who was
once committed to violence...

592
01:03:40,892 --> 01:03:43,053
now fightin' within the rules.

593
01:03:43,127 --> 01:03:45,061
It's caught their imagination.

594
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:48,621
People are here together-
Catholic and Protestant-

595
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,564
with no animosity.

596
01:03:51,302 --> 01:03:53,236
Don't be overeager.

597
01:03:53,304 --> 01:03:56,239
If you go for him too early,
you're in trouble.

598
01:03:58,009 --> 01:03:59,840
- How's it goin'?
- Not bad.

599
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:01,970
- Kids enjoyin' the gear?
- Just great.

600
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:05,709
Danny, you know Reggie Bell,
RUC community relations.

601
01:04:05,783 --> 01:04:09,014
Good luck tonight.
It's great for the city.

602
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:11,020
Great for all of us.

603
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:15,458
Lovely.
I'll leave you two.

604
01:04:15,526 --> 01:04:17,756
- All the best, Reg.
- Thanks.

605
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:26,129
- I don't like bein' used.
- What's wrong?

606
01:04:26,203 --> 01:04:28,933
- I don't like bein' used.
- He gave the kids all the equipment.

607
01:04:29,006 --> 01:04:30,473
Concentrate on the boxin'.

608
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:42,845
- Everything's set up.
- Okay.

609
01:04:44,021 --> 01:04:45,488
Here comes Joe Hamill.

610
01:04:48,859 --> 01:04:50,190
IRA bastard!

611
01:04:54,732 --> 01:04:56,962
- Bastard!
- Get out of Belfast!

612
01:04:57,034 --> 01:05:00,026
Stop fighting amongst yourselves!

613
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,504
<i>Can we all sing together...</i>

614
01:05:02,573 --> 01:05:04,905
<i>a song we all know,
"Danny Boy"?</i>

615
01:05:04,976 --> 01:05:05,965
<i>Altogether now.</i>

616
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:08,637
- Where's Liam?
- He's not comin'.

617
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,772
Did he say
he didn't want to come?

618
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:15,341
That's right.
He said he didn't want to come.

619
01:05:20,257 --> 01:05:23,090
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

620
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,857
<i>The pipes
The pipes are callin'</i>

621
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:30,600
<i>From glen to glen</i>

622
01:05:30,668 --> 01:05:34,661
<i>And down the mountainside</i>

623
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:37,799
<i>The summer's gone</i>

624
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:42,209
<i>And all the flowers are dying</i>

625
01:05:42,279 --> 01:05:46,215
Did you hear that?
That'll put pride in your heart.

626
01:05:46,283 --> 01:05:50,276
Frank Patterson's out front. He runs the
Commonwealth Sporting Club in London.

627
01:05:50,354 --> 01:05:53,187
- He's got a big promotion comin' up.
- Not now, Matt.

628
01:05:53,257 --> 01:05:55,248
It's on television.

629
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,590
It's a fuckin' meat trade,
and we don't want it.

630
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,289
There's a good
few grand in it.

631
01:05:59,363 --> 01:06:02,127
Forget about London.
Just concentrate on this fight.

632
01:06:03,134 --> 01:06:04,499
All right. Time to go.

633
01:06:04,568 --> 01:06:07,401
No dressin' gown.
No nothin'.

634
01:06:08,606 --> 01:06:12,235
<i>But come ye back</i>

635
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:16,643
<i>When summer's in the meadow</i>

636
01:06:17,782 --> 01:06:22,185
<i>Or when the valley's hushed</i>

637
01:06:22,253 --> 01:06:24,483
<i>And white with snow</i>

638
01:06:27,124 --> 01:06:30,491
<i>'Tis I'll be there</i>

639
01:06:30,561 --> 01:06:34,793
<i>In sunshine or in shadow</i>

640
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:41,263
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

641
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:44,501
<i>I love you so</i>

642
01:06:47,244 --> 01:06:49,940
Okay, boys, let's go.
Follow my instructions.

643
01:06:50,014 --> 01:06:52,608
Protect yourselves,
and shake hands.

644
01:07:29,453 --> 01:07:32,115
Stop! Go to a neutral corner.

645
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:34,951
One, two...

646
01:07:35,025 --> 01:07:37,493
three, four...

647
01:07:37,561 --> 01:07:39,791
five, six...

648
01:07:39,864 --> 01:07:41,559
seven-

649
01:07:41,632 --> 01:07:43,793
Are you all right?

650
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:45,301
Box!

651
01:08:11,362 --> 01:08:14,229
One, two, three...

652
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:17,995
four, five, six...

653
01:08:18,068 --> 01:08:19,695
seven, eight-

654
01:08:20,771 --> 01:08:22,568
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

655
01:08:26,076 --> 01:08:27,008
Box!

656
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,943
One, two, three...

657
01:08:34,018 --> 01:08:36,316
four, five...

658
01:08:36,387 --> 01:08:37,945
six, seven...

659
01:08:38,022 --> 01:08:40,889
eight, nine, ten!

660
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:42,391
You're out!

661
01:08:50,968 --> 01:08:53,630
Thanks very much.
Well done.

662
01:08:53,704 --> 01:08:55,865
Great night for the city of Belfast.

663
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:58,500
The crowd will be comin' out now,
Catholics and Protestants together.

664
01:08:58,576 --> 01:09:02,145
The band will lead them down the street.
Get as many good pictures as you can.

665
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,278
They'll be coming out together,
so you can clear the barriers away.

666
01:09:10,454 --> 01:09:11,386
Okay.

667
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:41,043
Keep calm.

668
01:09:41,118 --> 01:09:45,020
You can all see
where your exits are.

669
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,421
Don't panic.

670
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:50,051
Get up slowly.

671
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:52,118
Leave the building.

672
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,098
Just keep calm.

673
01:09:55,165 --> 01:09:57,759
There's absolutely
no need to panic.

674
01:09:59,436 --> 01:10:01,631
Go out through the main exit.

675
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,265
They've killed the policeman,
Reggie Bell. Let's move.

676
01:10:05,342 --> 01:10:08,277
Jesus! Come on.
Let's move it. Move it!

677
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:11,143
Follow the exit signs
behind you.

678
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:16,176
McCormack! McCormack!
I wanna talk to you now!

679
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,380
Go out through
the main exit.

680
01:10:18,455 --> 01:10:20,514
- Cop killer!
- There's no need to panic.

681
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:23,526
- Catholic bastards! Bastards!
- Follow the exit signs.

682
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,391
You're all right, son.

683
01:10:25,462 --> 01:10:28,397
- Kill him! Kill him!
- They killed a cop!

684
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:31,025
You're okay.
Take his hand now, son.

685
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,568
Keep calm.

686
01:10:32,636 --> 01:10:34,968
Watch yourself now.
That's right.

687
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:37,633
- Good, lad.
- Oh, Daddy! Oh, Daddy, no!

688
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:38,970
- You'll be okay!
- Daddy!

689
01:10:39,043 --> 01:10:41,238
- Quit pushin'!
- Dad!

690
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:46,212
There's a kid dyin' in there!

691
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:49,741
Give him some space!
There's a kid dyin' in there!

692
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:01,530
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Charge!

693
01:11:05,402 --> 01:11:06,869
Irish pigs!

694
01:11:38,435 --> 01:11:40,096
Run, Ned! Run!

695
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,104
Come on! Run, will ya?

696
01:11:46,977 --> 01:11:49,411
Where the fuck were you?

697
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,970
What are these for?

698
01:11:51,048 --> 01:11:53,209
They're the keys
to the gym. Come on.

699
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:54,876
Where's the petrol?

700
01:12:02,059 --> 01:12:04,994
Should never have taken
that gear from him.

701
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,934
Don't even think
about it, Ike.

702
01:12:12,002 --> 01:12:14,596
He has a wife and
three children, Danny.

703
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:19,535
Anything that
belongs to the cops.

704
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:21,202
We'll burn it outside.

705
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:30,952
- I'm not takin' that outside.
- Why not?

706
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:33,455
'Cause, Liam,
the Brits are everywhere.

707
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,827
We'll burn it here.

708
01:12:49,707 --> 01:12:51,538
Stop messin', Ned.

709
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,640
Mickey, roll over!
Oh, jeez!

710
01:12:59,717 --> 01:13:02,185
- Get him!
- Mickey, get up!

711
01:13:04,555 --> 01:13:08,685
Gotta get outta here!
Let's get out! Come on!

712
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,489
- Let's get out! Come on!
- Run, Mickey! Get out!

713
01:13:13,197 --> 01:13:15,324
The gym is on fire!

714
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:17,959
The gym's on fire!

715
01:13:45,929 --> 01:13:47,863
<i>Get away from the building!</i>

716
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,931
Get the pictures!

717
01:13:51,835 --> 01:13:54,303
<i>This is for your own safety!</i>

718
01:13:58,108 --> 01:14:00,702
- You'd better leave right now!
- Come on, Ike!

719
01:14:00,778 --> 01:14:01,972
Time to get out!

720
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,554
- You can't go in there!
- I work in there!

721
01:14:11,622 --> 01:14:14,853
- I work in there, and I have to get-
- It's not safe!

722
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:21,125
Get away from the building!

723
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:25,032
Serves youse bloody well right
for takin' the stuff from the police!

724
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:58,198
I'm in the middle of negotiations...

725
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:00,862
and you let off this fuckin' bomb.

726
01:15:02,773 --> 01:15:05,640
What did you achieve by it?
You achieved zero.

727
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,836
- Zero?
- Grow up. Grow up.

728
01:15:07,911 --> 01:15:11,813
Stop livin' in the past
and get your head into the future.

729
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:16,216
You can keep goin'.
You can split this organization in two.

730
01:15:16,286 --> 01:15:18,481
But you're gonna have
to accept the consequences.

731
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:22,423
- What consequences?
- You know what fuckin' consequences.

732
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:26,093
You don't have
all the guns, Joe.

733
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:31,930
A lot of the active servicemen won't
accept this peace bullshit anymore.

734
01:15:33,003 --> 01:15:34,334
Are you threatenin' me?

735
01:15:35,272 --> 01:15:36,534
You're goin' soft, Joe.

736
01:15:37,508 --> 01:15:38,873
Ya think so?

737
01:15:39,843 --> 01:15:41,777
You had men in prison...

738
01:15:41,845 --> 01:15:45,474
who starved themselves
to death for you, Joe.

739
01:15:45,549 --> 01:15:48,177
Ten of them.
Now you have Danny Boy Flynn...

740
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:51,517
wanderin' around the place makin'
a mockery of everything you stood for...

741
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:54,455
and you don't even see it.

742
01:15:54,525 --> 01:15:56,720
But a child can see it, Joe.

743
01:15:56,794 --> 01:15:58,887
A wee innocent child
can see the truth.

744
01:15:58,962 --> 01:16:00,827
What are you talkin' about?

745
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:05,192
Why don't you ask Liam
why he burned down the gym?

746
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:19,244
I just follow orders.

747
01:16:21,752 --> 01:16:24,516
He's way out of control, Joe.

748
01:16:26,523 --> 01:16:27,717
Hello, Maggie.

749
01:16:29,426 --> 01:16:32,293
- It's your da.
- All right.

750
01:16:47,945 --> 01:16:49,242
What's wrong?

751
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:51,713
I don't want to lose you.

752
01:16:52,883 --> 01:16:54,817
Sure you never will.

753
01:16:55,886 --> 01:16:58,411
You've got to be above reproach.

754
01:17:05,062 --> 01:17:09,522
Tell me- Tell me
you don't love Danny Flynn.

755
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:16,605
You've got to get rid of him.

756
01:17:24,114 --> 01:17:25,775
What are you talkin' about?

757
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,957
- We've done nothin' wrong.
- That's not the point.

758
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:39,223
- Everybody thinks you did.
- Well, to hell with them.

759
01:17:39,296 --> 01:17:41,230
To hell with 'em!

760
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:47,363
Liam burned down the gym.

761
01:18:02,019 --> 01:18:04,588
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.

762
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:16,428
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

763
01:18:16,499 --> 01:18:19,866
I saw ya.
I saw ya with him.

764
01:18:23,673 --> 01:18:26,335
You're gonna run away
with him, aren't ya?

765
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:39,685
I'm gonna stay
right here with you.

766
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:42,020
I don't want to
see him ever again.

767
01:18:58,041 --> 01:18:59,406
Leave him, Maggie.

768
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:03,010
He's suffered enough.

769
01:19:10,687 --> 01:19:12,621
He's suffered enough?

770
01:19:15,592 --> 01:19:16,524
Jesus.

771
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:23,426
My marriage was over
before Liam was even born.

772
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:33,908
I'm the prisoner here.

773
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:38,144
You and your politics
have made sure of that.

774
01:19:38,214 --> 01:19:40,774
All I wanted was for you
to have a good marriage.

775
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:43,513
Like you and my mother?

776
01:19:45,288 --> 01:19:47,222
Do you know how much
it cost her to smile...

777
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:50,487
every time you walked
through the front door?

778
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,291
She lived her whole bloody life
worried to death. And for what?

779
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:00,536
Will ya look me in the eye
and tell me for what?

780
01:20:02,605 --> 01:20:05,039
I suppose she
believed in me, Maggie.

781
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:09,543
She thought the ground
that you walked on was sacred.

782
01:20:10,613 --> 01:20:12,205
So did I.

783
01:20:14,984 --> 01:20:17,214
I'm not going to lose Danny.

784
01:20:17,287 --> 01:20:19,721
Then you'll have
to tell him to go.

785
01:20:19,789 --> 01:20:21,723
Why?

786
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:24,954
I can't protect him, Maggie.

787
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:32,233
You'll have to get rid of him,
or you'll find him in a pool of blood.

788
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:36,634
God help you.

789
01:20:45,749 --> 01:20:47,683
God help you, Father.

790
01:20:56,593 --> 01:20:58,527
Maggie, come in.

791
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,300
I have to talk to you, Danny.

792
01:21:06,369 --> 01:21:08,701
- Want a cup of tea?
- Aye.

793
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:30,589
I have something
to say to you.

794
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,996
I've been up all night, and I-

795
01:21:37,534 --> 01:21:39,468
I've written ya a letter.

796
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,371
"Dear Danny...

797
01:21:50,446 --> 01:21:54,382
It's taken me 14 years
to learn to live without you...

798
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:58,682
and I don't believe that here
in this place you can ever be mine.

799
01:21:59,756 --> 01:22:04,386
It's not possible because too
many people are gonna get hurt.

800
01:22:07,697 --> 01:22:09,665
I have to protect
those I love.

801
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:14,694
I'm so sorry, Danny.
God bless you.

802
01:22:14,771 --> 01:22:17,831
Yours always, Maggie."

803
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:48,365
What do you want?

804
01:22:49,205 --> 01:22:51,070
I'm askin' you to walk away.

805
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:55,277
I don't think so.

806
01:22:56,246 --> 01:22:59,409
- You made a promise.
- What was that?

807
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:02,417
You said if I asked you
to leave, you'd leave.

808
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:05,352
Mmm, aye.

809
01:23:05,421 --> 01:23:07,013
Well, I'm askin'.

810
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,556
Have you been threatened?

811
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:15,564
- Why do you say that?
- Have you?

812
01:23:16,733 --> 01:23:19,327
I do have a mind
of my own, Danny.

813
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:27,976
I know I might very well be losin' it,
but I do have a mind of my own.

814
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:31,104
Is it your father?
Is it Joe?

815
01:23:32,448 --> 01:23:33,938
No, Danny.

816
01:23:36,853 --> 01:23:38,150
It's Harry, isn't it?

817
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:42,282
Is it Harry?

818
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,618
Tell me.
Just fuckin' tell me.

819
01:23:47,697 --> 01:23:48,925
Don't, Danny.

820
01:23:52,602 --> 01:23:55,002
You don't understand.

821
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:58,837
Half my fuckin' life I pissed away
and all the good things in it...

822
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:02,036
because of that sickly bastard
and his dirty little...

823
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:06,445
cozy little, fuckin' secret world
and all the dirt in it.

824
01:24:06,516 --> 01:24:11,613
And now he's tryin' to turn us into
a dirty little secret. So, fuck him!

825
01:24:14,991 --> 01:24:17,653
Let him know that
I love you, Maggie.

826
01:24:17,727 --> 01:24:20,491
Go out and tell him now.
Go and fuckin' tell him.

827
01:24:20,563 --> 01:24:24,897
I'll not crawl around in
the fuckin' gutter for him!

828
01:24:24,968 --> 01:24:27,835
I'll kill him first.
I'll rip his fuckin' throat out!

829
01:24:27,904 --> 01:24:30,134
Don't go outside.
That's what he wants you to do.

830
01:24:30,206 --> 01:24:32,674
That's what he wants me to do,
and I'll fuckin' do it!

831
01:24:32,742 --> 01:24:35,176
Liam burned down the gym.

832
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:41,978
He saw us together.

833
01:24:42,051 --> 01:24:44,576
What are you talkin' about?

834
01:24:47,156 --> 01:24:49,989
He thinks you're gonna
take me away from him.

835
01:25:08,578 --> 01:25:10,239
Dear God.

836
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,213
God help him.

837
01:25:16,285 --> 01:25:20,278
When he was born, Danny,
I held him in my arms...

838
01:25:20,356 --> 01:25:23,519
and it made everything
all right.

839
01:25:24,727 --> 01:25:27,093
I can't hurt him.

840
01:25:29,132 --> 01:25:30,565
Come here.

841
01:25:39,542 --> 01:25:42,272
I'm not a killer, Maggie.

842
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:45,337
But this place
makes me want to kill.

843
01:25:56,259 --> 01:26:00,525
I wish we could stay
like this forever.

844
01:26:20,683 --> 01:26:22,617
You still have it.

845
01:26:23,686 --> 01:26:25,119
What?

846
01:26:26,189 --> 01:26:30,023
My soul, for what it's worth.

847
01:26:49,012 --> 01:26:52,771
We can store the stuff in here
till we get the gym goin' again.

848
01:26:55,985 --> 01:26:59,011
I'm goin' to London, Ike.
I'm takin' that fight.

849
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:03,618
It's a bloody circus...

850
01:27:03,693 --> 01:27:06,628
and you're their performin' monkey.

851
01:27:06,696 --> 01:27:09,631
We'll stay here.
We'll do things at our own pace.

852
01:27:09,699 --> 01:27:11,633
I'm goin', Ike,
and that's it.

853
01:27:12,969 --> 01:27:15,938
If you go, you're
goin' on your own.

854
01:27:16,005 --> 01:27:17,939
I'm not runnin' from anybody.

855
01:27:20,476 --> 01:27:22,910
You can use the flat
while I'm gone.

856
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:39,890
<i>Come on, Danny boy.
Move out of the corner. That's it.</i>

857
01:27:39,962 --> 01:27:43,056
Come on, Danny boy.
Get your feet workin'.

858
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:45,225
Get your feet workin'.
Stand in the middle of the ring.

859
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:47,394
- Ten seconds left in the round.
- That's it!

860
01:27:59,015 --> 01:28:01,415
- Where's Ike?
- He's over there.

861
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:02,917
Right there.

862
01:28:08,057 --> 01:28:09,991
Can I talk to you?

863
01:28:16,332 --> 01:28:18,527
It was me who burned the gym.

864
01:28:21,804 --> 01:28:23,032
Why?

865
01:28:23,106 --> 01:28:26,303
I thought Danny was gonna
run away with my mother.

866
01:28:30,413 --> 01:28:31,607
I'm sorry.

867
01:28:37,487 --> 01:28:40,479
Are you gonna
build the gym again?

868
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,856
Aye, of course, I will.
Sure, I will.

869
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:49,295
When?

870
01:28:52,735 --> 01:28:54,669
When Danny gets back.

871
01:28:59,442 --> 01:29:00,636
See ya later.

872
01:29:08,418 --> 01:29:11,046
Champagne toast. Come on.
Let's get the bubbly out.

873
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,681
Quick as you can, please.
Serve the top table first.

874
01:29:18,961 --> 01:29:22,761
Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you
all to please stand and pray silence...

875
01:29:22,832 --> 01:29:24,925
for your chairman
who will propose the toast?

876
01:29:25,001 --> 01:29:26,593
Your chairman.

877
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:30,539
The toast is the queen.

878
01:29:30,606 --> 01:29:32,437
The queen.

879
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,213
One, two...

880
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:40,442
three, four...

881
01:29:40,516 --> 01:29:43,144
five, six, seven...

882
01:29:43,219 --> 01:29:46,211
eight, nine, ten!

883
01:29:46,289 --> 01:29:47,221
He's out!

884
01:29:58,034 --> 01:30:00,059
And the third fight
this evening...

885
01:30:00,136 --> 01:30:02,661
ladies and gentlemen,
features from Nigeria-

886
01:30:38,608 --> 01:30:40,599
Come on, Danny.

887
01:30:44,113 --> 01:30:46,673
- Come on, Irish!
- Quiet, please.

888
01:30:56,425 --> 01:31:00,361
Gentlemen, can I ask you to confine
your appreciation to clapping?

889
01:31:00,429 --> 01:31:03,921
Bang. Jab him then.
Bing, bing. Keep movin'.

890
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,627
Stay on your toes.

891
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:31,626
He's doin' well here.

892
01:31:39,835 --> 01:31:42,565
<i>- Danny's ahead.
- Seeing excellent movement from Flynn.</i>

893
01:31:49,512 --> 01:31:51,605
Watch the heads.
Watch the heads.

894
01:31:53,749 --> 01:31:56,309
Come on. Break it up.
Break! Break! Move back!

895
01:32:02,325 --> 01:32:06,489
He's runnin' around too much.
He can't keep that up.

896
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:18,939
Get off the ropes, Danny!
Off the ropes!Jesus Christ.

897
01:32:34,457 --> 01:32:36,049
Come on, Akim!
Come on!

898
01:32:39,729 --> 01:32:42,197
You're okay.

899
01:32:42,264 --> 01:32:45,062
Phil, get the cut.
Danny, you're cut.

900
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:55,573
<i>This is it. Here comes
the clash of heads.</i>

901
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,482
<i>The Irishman's
too far behind in points.</i>

902
01:32:59,615 --> 01:33:01,810
<i>He's got to knock him out
to win this fight.</i>

903
01:33:21,003 --> 01:33:22,561
One, two...

904
01:33:22,638 --> 01:33:25,106
three, four, five...

905
01:33:25,174 --> 01:33:27,938
six, seven, eight-

906
01:33:29,078 --> 01:33:31,546
You're okay. You're okay.
Get your hands up.

907
01:33:32,615 --> 01:33:34,105
Box!

908
01:33:39,955 --> 01:33:41,081
Break!

909
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,597
One, two...

910
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:56,263
three, four...

911
01:33:56,338 --> 01:33:59,603
five, six...

912
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,973
seven, eight-

913
01:34:02,044 --> 01:34:05,070
Get your hands up. Box!

914
01:34:06,482 --> 01:34:08,143
Come on, Flynn. Box on!

915
01:34:14,723 --> 01:34:16,657
Come on, Flynn! Box!

916
01:35:02,504 --> 01:35:04,495
Box on!

917
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:08,767
Box on.

918
01:35:08,844 --> 01:35:10,038
It's over.

919
01:35:12,281 --> 01:35:14,545
- Box on.
- The fight's over.

920
01:35:16,285 --> 01:35:19,015
I told you he was a quitter,
didn't I, Betty?

921
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:22,023
You should have stopped the fuckin'
fight. You should have stopped it.

922
01:35:27,596 --> 01:35:28,961
<i>What an extraordinary ending.</i>

923
01:35:32,067 --> 01:35:34,126
You'll never fight
in this country again.

924
01:35:47,282 --> 01:35:49,216
Are you happy now?

925
01:35:49,284 --> 01:35:50,842
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

926
01:35:50,919 --> 01:35:54,013
<i>The pipes
The pipes are callin'</i>

927
01:35:55,224 --> 01:35:57,556
That's some boxer
you got there, Ike.

928
01:35:57,626 --> 01:36:00,595
Throws in his own towel.
You teach him that?

929
01:36:00,663 --> 01:36:03,427
Aye, you laugh at Danny Flynn...

930
01:36:03,499 --> 01:36:06,832
the only good thing that ever
came out of this district.

931
01:36:06,902 --> 01:36:11,703
I know you, Harry! You're only
interested in hurtin' people.

932
01:36:11,774 --> 01:36:14,538
That's your only pleasure,
isn't it?

933
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:16,908
Go and get yourself
another bottle of meths, Ike.

934
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,446
Take it easy, Harry.

935
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:26,678
You tell all the big boys
in there how you ran away...

936
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:30,552
how you left Danny Flynn
to take the blame...

937
01:36:30,626 --> 01:36:33,925
how he kept his mouth shut...

938
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:39,059
how he should've told and a lot more
innocent people would be alive today!

939
01:36:39,134 --> 01:36:42,729
Shut your fuckin' mouth,
ya drunken wino, or I'll shut it for ya.

940
01:36:42,805 --> 01:36:44,898
You killed this district, Harry!

941
01:36:44,973 --> 01:36:48,204
You killed
the one thing you loved.

942
01:36:48,277 --> 01:36:51,610
- Come on, Harry. He's irrelevant.
- Leave me alone.

943
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,045
Your own son!

944
01:36:53,115 --> 01:36:55,549
What are you talkin' about?

945
01:36:55,617 --> 01:37:00,145
You filled his head full of shit,
and you sent him out to die!

946
01:37:02,224 --> 01:37:04,351
Go home.

947
01:37:04,426 --> 01:37:05,859
Go home!

948
01:37:22,044 --> 01:37:25,642
He's dead. He's dead, Liam.

949
01:37:28,917 --> 01:37:30,851
Sorry, Liam.

950
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:35,816
The army says
he could be booby-trapped.

951
01:37:35,891 --> 01:37:38,553
- Come back, Liam!
- He could be booby-trapped!

952
01:37:38,627 --> 01:37:40,993
- He's booby-trapped!
- Liam! Come back!

953
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:45,090
Stay away from the body!
You have been warned!

954
01:37:45,167 --> 01:37:48,864
Stay back from the body!
Stay away!

955
01:37:48,937 --> 01:37:51,371
Stay away!
You have been warned!

956
01:38:58,106 --> 01:39:00,574
They're watching the house.

957
01:39:00,642 --> 01:39:04,100
Fuck 'em. Can I come in?

958
01:39:10,052 --> 01:39:12,543
- My father's here.
- Good.

959
01:39:12,621 --> 01:39:15,089
I'd like to have
a word with him too.

960
01:39:34,810 --> 01:39:36,744
I'm sorry about Ike Weir.

961
01:39:39,481 --> 01:39:43,645
I'm gonna build a gym for the kids.
Try and teach them somethin'.

962
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:48,212
You taught me to stand my ground,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

963
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:50,485
Are you back for revenge, Danny?

964
01:39:51,293 --> 01:39:54,922
No. No, I'm back for Maggie.

965
01:39:54,997 --> 01:39:56,988
Will she be safe with ya?

966
01:39:57,065 --> 01:39:58,999
She'll never be safer.

967
01:40:00,669 --> 01:40:04,127
I don't know if we can have
a life together. It's up to you.

968
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:07,642
You've more things
at stake than I have, you know?

969
01:40:09,845 --> 01:40:13,906
I'll not put her life in danger.
We'll talk. We'll work things out.

970
01:40:13,982 --> 01:40:17,145
Nor am I gonna sneak around
as if we've done wrong. We haven't.

971
01:40:19,554 --> 01:40:21,954
And I'm not leavin'.

972
01:40:22,024 --> 01:40:24,356
It's a dangerous game
you're playin'.

973
01:40:25,594 --> 01:40:29,291
It's a dangerous game, all right, Joe.
You know all about that.

974
01:40:30,999 --> 01:40:32,990
It's my home, you know?

975
01:40:34,202 --> 01:40:36,363
No one's gonna drive me
outta my home.

976
01:40:36,438 --> 01:40:38,565
Eternal rest grant unto him, Lord.

977
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:42,098
And may perpetual light shine upon him.
May he rest in peace.

978
01:40:42,177 --> 01:40:44,168
May his soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

979
01:40:44,246 --> 01:40:46,976
in the mercy of God rest in peace.

980
01:40:47,049 --> 01:40:48,516
Amen.

981
01:41:13,475 --> 01:41:16,103
- Let's go for a walk.
- Yep.

982
01:41:19,014 --> 01:41:22,472
Can I help ya rebuild the gym?
Is that okay?

983
01:41:22,551 --> 01:41:23,984
Aye.

984
01:41:26,754 --> 01:41:29,552
Why draw trouble to yourselves?

985
01:41:29,624 --> 01:41:33,720
Because it's mad to run away
as if we'd committed some crime.

986
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:43,570
- Don't forget.
- It's no problem. It's all right.

987
01:41:46,641 --> 01:41:48,108
Mr. Hamill.

988
01:41:57,585 --> 01:41:59,519
We're bein' followed.

989
01:42:17,738 --> 01:42:21,606
I'm not gonna let you drive around with
a prisoner's wife. Get out of the car.

990
01:42:21,676 --> 01:42:23,769
Get outta the car.

991
01:42:23,844 --> 01:42:27,075
Did you forget your weddin' ring,
ya fuckin' whore ya?

992
01:42:27,148 --> 01:42:29,480
You're a prisoner's wife.
You know what that means, don't ya?

993
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:32,951
Fuckin' whore.
You'd fuck anything, wouldn't ya?

994
01:42:43,664 --> 01:42:45,495
Give me the fuckin' thing!

995
01:42:45,566 --> 01:42:48,433
- Kill him!
- Stop it, you bastards!

996
01:42:48,502 --> 01:42:50,402
Stop it!

997
01:42:55,543 --> 01:43:00,037
Fuckin' whore! You know what
we sacrificed in this fuckin' war?

998
01:43:03,317 --> 01:43:04,579
Let's do it clean.

999
01:43:04,652 --> 01:43:06,313
Let him go, bastards!

1000
01:43:06,387 --> 01:43:08,184
Take him away.

1001
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:10,682
Move it!

1002
01:43:16,831 --> 01:43:20,790
What'd you think was gonna happen?
You can't just walk outta here!

1003
01:43:20,868 --> 01:43:23,632
For 25 years we've been
living with this shit!

1004
01:43:26,807 --> 01:43:31,776
He's fuckin' dead!

1005
01:43:38,085 --> 01:43:40,019
Let her go.
That's from Joe.

1006
01:44:18,092 --> 01:44:19,684
Move away.

1007
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,234
End of story, peacemaker.

1008
01:44:33,107 --> 01:44:34,870
Stand back.

1009
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:40,772
Move it.

1010
01:44:47,221 --> 01:44:49,451
Get away from here, Danny.

1011
01:45:37,805 --> 01:45:39,397
You all right?

1012
01:46:55,215 --> 01:46:56,705
Where are you goin'?

1013
01:46:57,785 --> 01:46:59,719
We're going home.
